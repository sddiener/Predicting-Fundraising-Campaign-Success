<h3>ABOUT US</h3>
<p>Ad Hoc Art began its dynamic existence in 2006, kicking off the art scene in Bushwick, Brooklyn as the first gallery in the hotbed of NYC’s talented visionaries seeking creative community amongst the concrete grit.  Dedicated to showing work often marginalized by the traditional art scene, AHA highlights the areas of street art, pop surrealism, lowbrow, illustration, comic book, and tattoo, as well as the extensive history of underground art, activism, printmaking, and graffiti.  It is a vehicle for artists who are passionate, committed to their craft, and challenging the boundaries of a “Fine Art” isolated from society at large.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""spotlight lazy"" data-src=""https://fbcdn-sphotos-c-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-prn1/25272_1408689258460_746021_n.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 720px; height: 540px;""/> Ad Hoc Art on Bogart St. in Bushwick, Brooklyn</p>
<p>Since its grassroots beginnings as an art hub and community space interwoven amongst the industrial factory grit, it has evolved into a robust cooperative fulcrum using creativity, collaboration and consciousness to deftly address the obstacles of today’s challenging times and catalyze the much-needed social change. We do this through the organization, curation, and production of public and private events such as exhibitions, happenings, workshops, festivals, and mural projects, like the one for which we are currently asking for your assistance, the Welling Court Mural Project.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>THE PROJECT</h3>
<p>Now in its 4th year, the project began when the community of Welling Court in Queens asked us to help spruce up their neighborhood in 2009.  Ad Hoc enthusiastically rose to the occasion organizing an event fitting for the diverse and energetic inhabitants.  The project has grown each year as spectacular crews of legendary, groundbreaking, and up-and-coming artists  join together to transform the neighborhood into a street-level gallery and public art experience.</p>
<p><img alt=""Micheael De Feo, Royce Bannon, Matt Siren, Cern, SPOne, Pink"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://fbcdn-sphotos-a-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/423719_10150706246669497_1157397971_n.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Micheael De Feo, Royce Bannon, Matt Siren, Cern, SPOne, Pink""/></p>
<p>Michael De Feo, Swoon, Royce, Matt Sirent, Cern, SPOne, Lady Pink; 2010</p>
<p>These new visual experiences change how people working, visiting, and living in this diverse area think about and interact with their environment.  Community members remark how the murals and the activity in the neighborhood have improved their quality of life and fostered a greater sense of pride for their surroundings.  Enthusiasts come from around the world to experience and document this rare visual opportunity.  Feedback from around the corner and around the world affirms that this initiative has produced a net quality of life increase both locally and globally.</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>WHY FUND?</h3>
<p>This fundraising campaign is essential to the current health and evolution of this project. We have previously produced the event through the incredibly generous support of the artists, organizers, volunteers, and neighborhood residents, all whom have donated their time, energy, and materials free of charge.  Whereas its grassroots origins have cultivated a wonderfully authentic art and community experience, in order to continue in a healthy manner we need to be able to provide a base level of support for those who give so much. </p>
<p>If the artists and organizers were justly compensated for their time and materials  spent on this project, the total budget would be well over six figures, which is what some mural projects cost with only 1/12 the participants! With over 80 artists painting more than 16,000 square feet of walls stretching throughout this NYC neighborhood, some serious paint, planning, infrastructure, and materials are required.</p>
<p>Your contribution gives us the funding needed to assist the artists and people who help make this happen.</p>

<p> </p>
<h3>WHERE YOUR MONEY GOES</h3>
<p><strong>Our funding goal is $19,000.</strong></p>
<p>NOTE: The project opens on June 15th, which is by when we would love to see the project fully funded or close to it so we know we have our bases covered. We have extended the funding period until July 1st to give ample time for those who would like to contribute to do so. </p>
<p><strong>This amount allows for us to cover some of the costs of producing this event, such as:</strong></p>
<p>- <strong>a stipend for the artists</strong> to help with their materials outlay; $13,000</p>
<p>- <strong>rental equipment</strong>, like the lift that allows us to paint previously inaccessible buildings, portable scaffolding, ladders, tables, tents, sound system; $2000</p>
<p><strong>- a nominal contribution to those who contribute significant labor, time and skills</strong> in helping this come to fruition in the months leading up to the event as well as providing the quality ambiance and infrastructure at the opening, including the neighborhood organizers that let us use their buildings, bathrooms, utilities, and facilities as home bases; the DJ's; and those at Ad Hoc Art who spend many hundreds of hours arranging this experience; $3,500</p>
<p>- <strong>materials and supplies</strong>, such as rollers, brushes, buckets, tarps; $500</p>
<p>If we exceed our fundraising goal, we will use those additonal funds to process our digital media and expand the project's visual and virtual presence.</p>
<h3>PERKS/REWARDS</h3>
<p><strong>To encourage your support this awesome project, we have put together an excellent assortment of Perks available for you, ranging from art items to art experiences. </strong></p>

<h3>MORE ON THE PROJECT</h3>
<p>This fourth round is not to be missed.  The project’s opening coincides with the annual block party, as the multi-talented hosts show off their cultural culinary skills, music, and dance.  Whereas this tiny neighborhood is providing some major ambience &amp; hospitality, it cannot provide for the attendees en masse, so think of this as a big social-picnic-potluck-art-fun-action and bring some of your favorite tasty foods, beverages, or other contributions-o-fun to share.</p>

ABOUT US
Ad Hoc Art began its dynamic existence in 2006, kicking off the art scene in Bushwick, Brooklyn as the first gallery in the hotbed of NYC’s talented visionaries seeking creative community amongst the concrete grit.  Dedicated to showing work often marginalized by the traditional art scene, AHA highlights the areas of street art, pop surrealism, lowbrow, illustration, comic book, and tattoo, as well as the extensive history of underground art, activism, printmaking, and graffiti.  It is a vehicle for artists who are passionate, committed to their craft, and challenging the boundaries of a “Fine Art” isolated from society at large.
 Ad Hoc Art on Bogart St. in Bushwick, Brooklyn
Since its grassroots beginnings as an art hub and community space interwoven amongst the industrial factory grit, it has evolved into a robust cooperative fulcrum using creativity, collaboration and consciousness to deftly address the obstacles of today’s challenging times and catalyze the much-needed social change. We do this through the organization, curation, and production of public and private events such as exhibitions, happenings, workshops, festivals, and mural projects, like the one for which we are currently asking for your assistance, the Welling Court Mural Project.
 
THE PROJECT
Now in its 4th year, the project began when the community of Welling Court in Queens asked us to help spruce up their neighborhood in 2009.  Ad Hoc enthusiastically rose to the occasion organizing an event fitting for the diverse and energetic inhabitants.  The project has grown each year as spectacular crews of legendary, groundbreaking, and up-and-coming artists  join together to transform the neighborhood into a street-level gallery and public art experience.

Michael De Feo, Swoon, Royce, Matt Sirent, Cern, SPOne, Lady Pink; 2010
These new visual experiences change how people working, visiting, and living in this diverse area think about and interact with their environment.  Community members remark how the murals and the activity in the neighborhood have improved their quality of life and fostered a greater sense of pride for their surroundings.  Enthusiasts come from around the world to experience and document this rare visual opportunity.  Feedback from around the corner and around the world affirms that this initiative has produced a net quality of life increase both locally and globally.

The 2013 list of artists includes this lovely global array:

 Abe Lincoln, Jr., AM, Alison Buxton, Beau Stanton, Billy Mode, Brian Life, Caleb Neelon, Carlos Mare, Cekis, Cern, Christopher Cardinale, Chris Mendoza, Chris RWK, Chris Stain, Clown Soldier, Col Wallnuts, Cycle, Dan Witz, Dennis McNett, Don Leicht, El Kamino, Ellis Gallagher, Free5, Fumero, Gaia, Garrison Buxton, gilf!, Greg Lamarche, Hellbent, Ian Kuali’i, Icy & Sot, Joe Iurato, John Breiner, JC, John Fekner, Jonathan Villoch, Katie Yamasaki, Kimyon Huggins, Lady Pink, lmnop, LogikOne, M-City, Magdalena Marcerano, Matt Siren, Mensen, Mike Fitzsimmons, Mr. Kiji, Never, ND’A, Olek, Pablo Power, Phetus, Prolifique, Queen Andrea, R. Nicholas Kuszyk, Rene Gagnon, Royal Kingbee, Royce Bannon, Rubin, Russell King, Ryan Seslow, SeeOne, Sheryo, Sinned, Skewville, Sonni, SpazeCraft, Subtexture, Steven Cogle, Thundercut, TooFly, Veng RWK, Vera Times, Vexta, Wane COD, The Yok, Zam & more.
 
WHY FUND?
This fundraising campaign is essential to the current health and evolution of this project. We have previously produced the event through the incredibly generous support of the artists, organizers, volunteers, and neighborhood residents, all whom have donated their time, energy, and materials free of charge.  Whereas its grassroots origins have cultivated a wonderfully authentic art and community experience, in order to continue in a healthy manner we need to be able to provide a base level of support for those who give so much. 
If the artists and organizers were justly compensated for their time and materials  spent on this project, the total budget would be well over six figures, which is what some mural projects cost with only 1/12 the participants! With over 80 artists painting more than 16,000 square feet of walls stretching throughout this NYC neighborhood, some serious paint, planning, infrastructure, and materials are required.
Your contribution gives us the funding needed to assist the artists and people who help make this happen.
 
CR, M-City, Cey Adams; 2010
 
WHERE YOUR MONEY GOES
Our funding goal is $19,000.
NOTE: The project opens on June 15th, which is by when we would love to see the project fully funded or close to it so we know we have our bases covered. We have extended the funding period until July 1st to give ample time for those who would like to contribute to do so. 
This amount allows for us to cover some of the costs of producing this event, such as:
- a stipend for the artists to help with their materials outlay; $13,000
- rental equipment, like the lift that allows us to paint previously inaccessible buildings, portable scaffolding, ladders, tables, tents, sound system; $2000
- a nominal contribution to those who contribute significant labor, time and skills in helping this come to fruition in the months leading up to the event as well as providing the quality ambiance and infrastructure at the opening, including the neighborhood organizers that let us use their buildings, bathrooms, utilities, and facilities as home bases; the DJ's; and those at Ad Hoc Art who spend many hundreds of hours arranging this experience; $3,500
- materials and supplies, such as rollers, brushes, buckets, tarps; $500
If we exceed our fundraising goal, we will use those additonal funds to process our digital media and expand the project's visual and virtual presence.
PERKS/REWARDS
To encourage your support this awesome project, we have put together an excellent assortment of Perks available for you, ranging from art items to art experiences. 
There is a limit to having 12 Perks active at a time, so if you are interested in something listed and don’t see it on the site, let us know.  As Perks are funded, we will replace them with new ones.
By Monday, June 3rd we will have additional links and photos for the Perks.

MORE ON THE PROJECT
This fourth round is not to be missed.  The project’s opening coincides with the annual block party, as the multi-talented hosts show off their cultural culinary skills, music, and dance.  Whereas this tiny neighborhood is providing some major ambience & hospitality, it cannot provide for the attendees en masse, so think of this as a big social-picnic-potluck-art-fun-action and bring some of your favorite tasty foods, beverages, or other contributions-o-fun to share.

The Grand Plaza will feature flaming Mayan Stelae, Glyph Torches, and will be flanked by Ceiba Trees, the Mayan Tree of Life. Massive Fire Cannons will blast from the tops of both Pyramid Temples and they will be further illuminated by wide arrays of beautiful LED color wash panels and sequenced lines of Data Flash strobes.

<p>Our projected budget for the entire Tikal 2012 Art Installation is over $30,000</p>
<p>So why did we set our goal at $9,999? Great question! Well for starters, it's a really cool number, but seriously... indiegogo only takes 4% if you meet or surpass your goal, but they take 9% if you fall short of it! We decided to set a conservative goal to increase our chances of paying the more reasonable fee. That being said, we of course would much prefer to shatter our goal by obtaining enough contributions to fund the entire project!</p>

<h3>PROJECT</h3>
<p>These life rafts are 25' in diameter and were designed to hold 50 people.  They were a huge success at WUYC's Summer Party.  And we're bringing them up to Ephemerisle.</p>
<p>But now, they're going to be upgraded.  Plans are still being finalized, but it's likely the WUYC island will be created as a semi-circle and these two life rafts will be in the middle.</p>
<p>One of the life rafts, rebranded ""Duck Pond"" will be partially filled with water, it will have rubber duckies floating in it, and will have a water fountain in the middle.    This water will be filtered so it should be slightly better for relaxing in then the delta water.</p>
<p>The other life raft, ""Snugglers Cove"" will provide shade during the day and be lit up at night.</p>
<p>Both of them will be fully solar powered.  </p>
<h3>WHAT WE NEED</h3>
<p>The $700 is going to pay for pumps, solar panels, batteries, lights, shade, ducks, and structure.</p>
<h3>RISKS AND CHALLENGES</h3>
<p>There are a couple of small holes in the rafts that need to be repaired for Ephemerisle.  We believe there should be no problem in patching them with spare hypalon and 5200.  </p>
<p>It's possible that the shade structure may fail completely in the wind, but the shades are being designed with simple halyards so they can be dropped quickly if the wind picks up.  </p>
<h3>OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP</h3>
<p>There's going to be at least a couple of work days where we repair the rafts, test out the shade structure design, and load them onto a boat for transport.</p>
<p>Any extra hands would be super appreciated. <br/> </p>

<h2><strong>Last Day Update</strong></h2>
<div class=""announcement clearfix"">
<div class=""activity-content"">
<p>Thank you, everyone, for your support of this immense project!</p>
<p>I want to tell all of our funders not to be disappointed. It may appear that we have not crossed the halfway mark, but in actuality we have. In fact, we are fully funded!</p>
<p>It was difficult to project figures for this campaign since we knew that in addition to the online contributions, we would also have significant figures for people reserving books directly with the Press. These off-line funders include our small core of subscribers – the folks who collect all work to come out of the Press – and others whom are fairly regular buyers. Some prefer to send a cheque in the mail, and others wanted to use the volume-by-volume option to reserve the books (something we were not able to offer through online campaign).</p>
<p>So, what are the numbers?</p>
<p>Monies already received from off-line buyers (money already in the bank) has surpassed $8,000, with a further $5,500 committed for the balance of their purchases. New orders have been coming in, even as recent as an hour ago, adding another $2,700.</p>
<p><strong>The cash figure (on and offline) is $17,115.</strong><br/><strong>With the balance of orders, that total jumps to $22,715.</strong><br/><strong>With the new, yet unsecured orders, our figure climbs to $25,415.</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>(As I write this, contributions continue to flow in.)</em></strong></p>
<p>What this means is that we have enough funds in hand to buy our most needed materials (paper, new type and engraving blocks) and funds will continue to flow in, to cover the binding materials further on.</p>
<p>We shall continue to post updates as the project continues. Thank you everyone for helping to make it happen.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2><strong>The Pitch</strong></h2>
<p>It is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man, in possession of a good printing press, must be in want of a project.</p>
<p>Indeed, we want this monumental project: to produce 138 copies of <em>Pride and Prejudice</em>, in 3 volumes.</p>
<p>The text will be hand-set in metal type, printed letterpress on archival paper, illustrated with at least a dozen original wood-engravings in each volume, hand-bound in fine materials, and be a treasure to read.</p>
<p>No private press has undertaken such a small edition of this novel. Hardly a private press today will undertake a work of such length, and choose to hand-set it. So why do we? We love Jane. Moreso, we love <em>Pride and Prejudice</em>. And we know others do too. Favourite stories are treasures. We like to design them that way.</p>
<p>The project, however, leaves us gobsmacked when we consider the quantity of materials needed, and needed altogether, and the costs therein. Although we are breaking it up into 3 volumes, as it was originally published, all the materials must be purchased together, so that everything will match when the books are put together on (your) shelf at the conclusion of the project.</p>
<p><strong>Who we are</strong></p>
<p>Jarrett Morrison founded The Bowler Press in 2007 after learning to mind his p's and q's from his mentors, Jan and Crispin Elsted, of Barbarian Press.

</div></div>","Last Day Update


Thank you, everyone, for your support of this immense project!
I want to tell all of our funders not to be disappointed. It may appear that we have not crossed the halfway mark, but in actuality we have. In fact, we are fully funded!
It was difficult to project figures for this campaign since we knew that in addition to the online contributions, we would also have significant figures for people reserving books directly with the Press. These off-line funders include our small core of subscribers – the folks who collect all work to come out of the Press – and others whom are fairly regular buyers. Some prefer to send a cheque in the mail, and others wanted to use the volume-by-volume option to reserve the books (something we were not able to offer through online campaign).
So, what are the numbers?
Monies already received from off-line buyers (money already in the bank) has surpassed $8,000, with a further $5,500 committed for the balance of their purchases. New orders have been coming in, even as recent as an hour ago, adding another $2,700.
The cash figure (on and offline) is $17,115.With the balance of orders, that total jumps to $22,715.With the new, yet unsecured orders, our figure climbs to $25,415.
(As I write this, contributions continue to flow in.)
What this means is that we have enough funds in hand to buy our most needed materials (paper, new type and engraving blocks) and funds will continue to flow in, to cover the binding materials further on.
We shall continue to post updates as the project continues. Thank you everyone for helping to make it happen.


The Pitch
It is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man, in possession of a good printing press, must be in want of a project.
Indeed, we want this monumental project: to produce 138 copies of Pride and Prejudice, in 3 volumes.
The text will be hand-set in metal type, printed letterpress on archival paper, illustrated with at least a dozen original wood-engravings in each volume, hand-bound in fine materials, and be a treasure to read.
No private press has undertaken such a small edition of this novel. Hardly a private press today will undertake a work of such length, and choose to hand-set it. So why do we? We love Jane. Moreso, we love Pride and Prejudice. And we know others do too. Favourite stories are treasures. We like to design them that way.
The project, however, leaves us gobsmacked when we consider the quantity of materials needed, and needed altogether, and the costs therein. Although we are breaking it up into 3 volumes, as it was originally published, all the materials must be purchased together, so that everything will match when the books are put together on (your) shelf at the conclusion of the project.

<h3>About myself...</h3>
</center></div>
<div>Hi, I'm Marko. I'm a passionate shape and form lover with a great sense for technology meets art and inspiring design compositions; Entrepreneur with the idea of combining latest tech trends and diverse traditional art wisdom mixed with contemporary design and photography. <br/>I have worked on many tech projects like ScienceFair, New Tech Innovation NTI and NOsleep just to name a few, but the art is what really makes me think out of the box. I started out merely as an art appreciator, but now I find it exhilarating and I'm thankful for any work by any artist that inspired me.</div>
<div>
<br/>As art and tech are my biggest passions, an idea and wish of combining those was born few years ago, but I need your help to take it the next step further and make it comes true. I've used freelance design work to raise funds during last eight months and that gave me opportunity to put aside $560 for this project. Nevertheless, that's only a fraction of the money for the whole project to see the day light...<br/><br/>In the following paragraphs you'll be able to get to learn key features of this art-tech marriage. Thank you so much for taking time to get to know my project better.<br/><br/>

<h3><img alt=""collage10"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/J2dly.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""lighting""/></h3>
<h3>About the project itself (in a nutshell)</h3>
</center>My main guideline is to bring technology-photography relationship even closer. Combining artistic photographs made by humans and arranging them with the precision of “artificial brain”. Idea of artificial intelligence creating ""art"" excite me a lot, but what makes me trilled the most is AI creating something appealing to human eye, something pleasant that people can enjoy in.</div>
<div>
<br/>This will be unique photographic way to explore environmental sights of contemporary form-focused artists through the patterns of eye appealing photographic collage (or rather unique mixture of collage and mosaic).<br/><br/>
</div>
<div>
<center>
<h3><img alt=""collage06"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/TRpKp.png"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;"" title=""dunes send""/></h3>
<h3>With Your Help</h3>
</center>Donations, be they small or large, are immensely appreciated. Funds raised ($3750 – Indiegogo Fees – payment processor fees – wire transfer ~=$3350) will be used for the installation materials, hi-res printing, framing and shipping costs for the gallery exhibition (~$1500), website service development (~$1300) and finally travel expenses to the town of your choice (perk H) and other towns if sufficient funds.</div>
<div>
<br/>The first exhibition will be held in local gallery of my choice, but hopefully I’ll be able to bring the installation to the cities across the World. That depends on exceeding the goal - the more of your support, the more cities I'll be able to exhibit to... and I'll be sooo glad to exhibit at at least one USA city if not more.</div>
<div>
<br/>Why flexible funding? I won't be able to complete this project if all funds have not been raised - that’s for sure... BUT, I'll continue to freelance and add money to existing $560 that I've managed to put a side + the money raised with your generous help through this Indiegogo campaign (close to $3900 in total). That way, hopefully, the project will see the day light in the cities across the whole Europe.<br/><br/>

<h3>More in depth on the project (the full story)</h3>
</center>Website service will be able to find similar photographs (based on a given keyword), scale and arrange them in photographic collage like the ones you can see on this campaign page. The more is the better in this case, so as web service is able to find more photographs the better results will be.</div>
<div>
<br/>You would go to the website, enter a keyword, and get returned results for that keyword arranged in patterns (photographic collage) of related photographs. Photographic collages with the most keyword requests and with the most votes by visitors will be printed in hi-resolution, framed and exhibited in galleries.</div>
<div>
<br/>This way we popularize art photography combined with technology in creating new art forms. Also we produce pictures that positively resonate with human eye (that enjoys repeating scenes).</div>
<div>
<br/>Throughout the history, humans had always been hoarders. One likes to poses (or at least see) lots of the same things piled up and reacts strongly to a lot of items of the same kind... and if those things are neatly sorted out, even better... (or is that just OCD??? :D ) Therefore these pictures are real eye-candy and provoke positive emotions.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Note: Even though collage is an assemblage of different forms that create a new whole, and mosaic is an assemblage of small pieces used to create a picture, I like to think of this form as a mixture of the two, and rather refer to it as photographic collage. :)<br/><br/>

<h3>The Impact</h3>

<div>
<br/>Also, our website will provide platform for the users to create their own photo collages with the keyword of their choosing.</div>

For animal guardians, pets play an important role in their lives. Studies have shown owning a pet helps anxiety, depression, stress, lowers blood pressure, and regulates heart rate.  As is true with any relationship, some human-pet relationships are likely to be more rewarding than others. Some people are more attached to their pets than others and those feelings could influence the impact of the pet on the person’s health and life.</p><p>As for me, I am a cat person. I always have been. I used to beg my parents to let me adopt a cat. I remember walking the alleyways of Tehran, finding abandoned kittens, and bringing them back home with me. However, my parents were always against me for keeping them. Now that I am older, I am capable of taking care of my own friends. I adopted two cats during my college years. One of them was a kitten, and the other was an eight year old rescue from an animal shelter.</p><p>My furry friend Margo was my soul mate; my best friend. Every morning and night I would wake up and go to sleep to her cuddles and kisses. We spent six wonderful years together and made many memories. However as coincidence would have it, on 5/26 in 2016 at 5:26am I had to put her down. She was suffering from kidney and liver failure. I was heartbroken and sad that I couldn’t save her. But I knew she would always be with me. She was the light of my life. Now she shows me the light when I am in the dark. During my process of mourning, I am releasing that energy through art.

For animal guardians, pets play an important role in their lives. Studies have shown owning a pet helps anxiety, depression, stress, lowers blood pressure, and regulates heart rate.  As is true with any relationship, some human-pet relationships are likely to be more rewarding than others. Some people are more attached to their pets than others and those feelings could influence the impact of the pet on the person’s health and life.As for me, I am a cat person. I always have been. I used to beg my parents to let me adopt a cat. I remember walking the alleyways of Tehran, finding abandoned kittens, and bringing them back home with me. However, my parents were always against me for keeping them. Now that I am older, I am capable of taking care of my own friends. I adopted two cats during my college years. One of them was a kitten, and the other was an eight year old rescue from an animal shelter.My furry friend Margo was my soul mate; my best friend. Every morning and night I would wake up and go to sleep to her cuddles and kisses. We spent six wonderful years together and made many memories. However as coincidence would have it, on 5/26 in 2016 at 5:26am I had to put her down. She was suffering from kidney and liver failure. I was heartbroken and sad that I couldn’t save her. But I knew she would always be with me. She was the light of my life. Now she shows me the light when I am in the dark. During my process of mourning, I am releasing that energy through art. She is my inspiration for this project.Space Cats will be an art installation placed in deep playa hopefully by trash fence at Burning Man for the wanderers, the lost ones, and adventurers to come across.

<p>We are three New York-based professional artists: Daniel “Don Solaris” Melguizo , filmmaker and cinematographer (<a href=""http://www.danielsolaris.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.danielsolaris.com</a>); Elisa Toro Franky, dancer, teacher, and choreographer in ballet and tango (<a href=""http://www.elisatorofranky.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.elisatorofranky.com</a>); and Jacob Taylor, dancer, teacher, and choreographer in ballet and musical theatre (<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/jacob.taylor.9237"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.facebook.com/jacob.taylor.9237</a>). We believe in the potential of bridging artistic disciplines, thus we envision filmmaking and dance as two perspectives that would greatly enrich each other. We wish to film dance in order to provide a <span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>360-degree angle of the movement, breaking the usual wall of separation between audience and dancer. </span></p>
<p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>Our film of two dance works would take place at a natural location,  making the dancer an integral part of the environment as opposed to being isolated on an elevated stage. Filmmaking utilizes the natural light and shadow of any environment to create volumes, and for us this would highlight the expressive aspects of dance as deeply human and real.</span></p>
<p>The two works to be filmed are representative of our double nature as immigrants living in the United States: a jazz duet that evokes the hues of our Anglo-Saxon adopted culture, and a solo that evokes tango as one of the most human of musical expressions from our Hispanic-Latino roots.</p>
<p>Juntos y Aparte, danced and choreographed by Elisa and Jacob, is a jazz duet that takes a comical tone to speak of the ever-present tensions in any relationship. It integrates elements of  ballet and tango into the jazz expression, set to music by Caravan Palace - 12 juin 3049.</p>
<p>Naranjo en Flor, choreographed by Dardo Galletto and danced by Elisa, is a solo that becomes an abstraction of a tango. Blending ballet and contemporary vocabularies, it expresses the feeling of romantic loss, which lies at the heart of this most traditional song in the tango canon.</p>
<p>In order to achieve the cinematic look that we are envisioning, we will be using tools such as professional digital cinema cameras, dollies, cranes, drones, Steadicam and sliders. We will also use Zeiss film lenses to capture the highest image quality, shooting 120fps to be able to use slow motion when needed - without any loss in quality. </p>
<p>Your contribution to this project would help us to cover the costs of renting and transporting the above mentioned filming equipment, as well as the costs of renting the venue where the filming itself will take place. We hope to bring this project to fruition with your support, which is instrumental and truly valuable to us!</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

We wish to film dance in order to provide a 360-degree angle of the movement, breaking the usual wall of separation between audience and dancer. 
Our film of two dance works would take place at a natural location,  making the dancer an integral part of the environment as opposed to being isolated on an elevated stage. Filmmaking utilizes the natural light and shadow of any environment to create volumes, and for us this would highlight the expressive aspects of dance as deeply human and real.
The two works to be filmed are representative of our double nature as immigrants living in the United States: a jazz duet that evokes the hues of our Anglo-Saxon adopted culture, and a solo that evokes tango as one of the most human of musical expressions from our Hispanic-Latino roots.
Juntos y Aparte, danced and choreographed by Elisa and Jacob, is a jazz duet that takes a comical tone to speak of the ever-present tensions in any relationship. It integrates elements of  ballet and tango into the jazz expression, set to music by Caravan Palace - 12 juin 3049.
Naranjo en Flor, choreographed by Dardo Galletto and danced by Elisa, is a solo that becomes an abstraction of a tango. Blending ballet and contemporary vocabularies, it expresses the feeling of romantic loss, which lies at the heart of this most traditional song in the tango canon.
In order to achieve the cinematic look that we are envisioning, we will be using tools such as professional digital cinema cameras, dollies, cranes, drones, Steadicam and sliders. We will also use Zeiss film lenses to capture the highest image quality, shooting 120fps to be able to use slow motion when needed - without any loss in quality. 
Your contribution to this project would help us to cover the costs of renting and transporting the above mentioned filming equipment, as well as the costs of renting the venue where the filming itself will take place. We hope to bring this project to fruition with your support, which is instrumental and truly valuable to us!

<p><strong>Who we are:</strong></p>
<p>We are the AWE Station Collective - a crew of passionate and experienced burners. Since 2016 our crew members have participated in 4 Burning Man events at Black Rock City in Nevada, 3 AfrikaBurns at Tankwa Town, and one Netherlands Burn at Where the Sheep Sleep in the Netherlands. In April 2017 they were part of the team that built the art installation The Labyrinth at Tankwa Town then took its next iteration to The Netherland Burn where they designed and built the temple there in July 2017. Its members have also been part of the Black Rock Observatory camp since 2017 and help build its art installation - the observatory - man the telescopes and the meteorite museum, and give talks about the wonders of the universe and mysteries of the cosmos. Sign up here and join us: <a href=""https://tinyurl.com/awestation"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://tinyurl.com/awestation</a></p>
<p><strong>Why this is important:</strong></p>
<p>Awe is described as an experience of such perceptual vastness that you literally have to reconfigure your mental models of the world in order to assimilate it. This is a feeling that most would like to experience, but only few have. Those of us who have been to a burn certainly have.</p>
<p>AWE Station is an art installation that captures the awe, wonder, and magic of AfrikaBurn. The ""A W E"" letter blocks will serve as a magical display against the background of the Milky Way and will be a place of existential and cosmic experiences whose impact will go beyond the grounds of the Binnekring because awestruck burners take that awe with them to the default world and the ripples continue.</p>
<p>Project AWE Station also has a theme camp where burners will attend events like live storytelling, performance poetry, and future-focused talks around the themes of intelligent optimism, taking a cosmic perspective, and preparing for civilization-level change.</p>
<p><strong>How you can help:</strong></p>
<p>Your contribution makes Project AWE Station possible and those interacting with this installation at AfrikaBurn will have a transformative art experience, which in turn will lead them to build and inspire the community they envision in the default world. This is thanks to one of the 10 guiding principles: Participation, below in the words of Burning Man co-founder Larry Harvey:</p>
<p><strong>Participation</strong></p>
<p>Our community is committed to a radically participatory ethic. We believe that transformative change, whether in the individual or in society, can occur only through the medium of deeply personal participation. We achieve being through doing. Everyone is invited to work. Everyone is invited to play. We make the world real through actions that open the heart.</p>
<p>This is your opportunity to participate, “to make the world real through actions that open the heart”.</p>

<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Exhibiting the world's largest photograph at PhotoNOLA continues New Orleans' powerful engagement with photography. In 1840 Jules Lion brought the daguerreotype to New Orleans when he opened one of the first photographic portrait studios in North America. Having learned the process directly from Louis Daguerre (the eponymous inventor of the daguerreotype process), Lion saw the potential of the process and helped spark the ""daguerreotype revolution"" in America. While there are no verifiable </span><i style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">dags </i><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">that can be attributed to Lion, his legacy and spirit lives on here in NOLA in places like </span><i style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">A Gallery of Fine Photography </i><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">(which opened in 1975 and is one of the oldest galleries in the U.S. dealing exclusively in photography) and The New Orleans Museum of Art (which houses a photo collection comprising of over 10,000 prints)</span></p>
<p>With this in mind, The New Orleans Photo Alliance, Contemporary Arts Center New Orleans, The American Society of Media Photographers New Orleans/Gulf South Chapter and The Legacy Project are working together to bring <i>The Great Picture</i> to the city for PhotoNOLA 2013.</p>
<p><b>What is the Great Picture?</b></p>
<p><i style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The Great Picture</i><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> is the world's largest photograph, a history-making image three stories high by eleven stories wide. The  photograph was made using a shuttered Southern California F-18 jet aircraft hangar transformed into a gigantic camera obscura—the largest camera ever made. It's a  grand statement -- a final monumental black-and-white photograph made at the point photography transitions from film to pixels.</span></p>
<p><i>The Great Picture</i> was created over the nine months leading up to July 2006 by six well-known photographic artists collectively known as The Legacy Project, aided by 400 volunteers, artists, and experts. Working in their jet-hangar-transformed-into-camera, the group hand-applied 80 liters of black and white emulsion to a seamless 3,375-square-foot canvas substrate custom-made in Germany. Development was done in a custom Olympic pool-sized developing tray using ten high volume submersible pumps and 1,800 gallons of black and white chemistry.<br/></p>
<p><b>Why NOLA and PhotoNOLA? </b></p>
<p><i>The Great Picture</i> is magnetic and inspirational (just like New Orleans) and it will pull together the community and have the dangerous effect of inspiring everyone to think big. Of course thinking big is what New Orleans is all about. With an expansive creative community, New Orleans has become a hotbed of artists, collectors, scholars and entrepreneurs. It has been shown from Art Center in Los Angeles to the Central Academy of Fine Arts in Beijing, drawing thousands of visitors. Now it's New Orleans' turn. </p>
<p>The Great Picture at PhotoNOLA 2013 will be a landmark exhibition of a landmark photograph. PhotoNOLA is now in its 8th year and is already a preeminent, internationally recognized photo festival. Bringing <i>The Great Picture </i>here to the city further cements PhotoNOLA's reputation as an active partner in the photography community both here in the Gulf Coast region and nationwide. </p>
<p>When the opportunity to bring The Great Picture to NOLA arose we thought: ""How can we make this happen?"" From that point onward, seemingly overwhelming odds and a host of discouraging logistical and technical issues simply ceased to hold any sway over the determination to extract what is possible from the improbable. </p>
<p><i>The Great Picture</i> is more than the physical artifact labeled as “the world’s largest photograph;"" it is a tangible expression of the human spirit. What better place than New Orleans to make this point?<br/></p>
<p><b>Great, how can I help?</b></p>
<p>Well, we have already raised $7,000 to cover the 40-foot over-the-road truck from Los Angeles, forklifts and boom lifts, crating and equipment. Now we need to fund rigging, custom lighting, special exhibition production, travel expenses (and plenty of odds and ends). This is no ordinary photograph. It weighs 1,800 pounds and will require many hands to install; exhibitions are akin to heavy construction.<br/></p>
<p>So you can help by donating of course, but you can also help by simply spreading the word for us and sharing this campaign with your friends and neighbors. </p>

</div></span></span></span></span></span></div>","Photography is in NOLA's veins.
Exhibiting the world's largest photograph at PhotoNOLA continues New Orleans' powerful engagement with photography. In 1840 Jules Lion brought the daguerreotype to New Orleans when he opened one of the first photographic portrait studios in North America. Having learned the process directly from Louis Daguerre (the eponymous inventor of the daguerreotype process), Lion saw the potential of the process and helped spark the ""daguerreotype revolution"" in America. While there are no verifiable dags that can be attributed to Lion, his legacy and spirit lives on here in NOLA in places like A Gallery of Fine Photography (which opened in 1975 and is one of the oldest galleries in the U.S. dealing exclusively in photography) and The New Orleans Museum of Art (which houses a photo collection comprising of over 10,000 prints)
With this in mind, The New Orleans Photo Alliance, Contemporary Arts Center New Orleans, The American Society of Media Photographers New Orleans/Gulf South Chapter and The Legacy Project are working together to bring The Great Picture to the city for PhotoNOLA 2013.
What is the Great Picture?
The Great Picture is the world's largest photograph, a history-making image three stories high by eleven stories wide. The  photograph was made using a shuttered Southern California F-18 jet aircraft hangar transformed into a gigantic camera obscura—the largest camera ever made. It's a  grand statement -- a final monumental black-and-white photograph made at the point photography transitions from film to pixels.
The Great Picture was created over the nine months leading up to July 2006 by six well-known photographic artists collectively known as The Legacy Project, aided by 400 volunteers, artists, and experts. Working in their jet-hangar-transformed-into-camera, the group hand-applied 80 liters of black and white emulsion to a seamless 3,375-square-foot canvas substrate custom-made in Germany. Development was done in a custom Olympic pool-sized developing tray using ten high volume submersible pumps and 1,800 gallons of black and white chemistry.
Why NOLA and PhotoNOLA? 
The Great Picture is magnetic and inspirational (just like New Orleans) and it will pull together the community and have the dangerous effect of inspiring everyone to think big. Of course thinking big is what New Orleans is all about. With an expansive creative community, New Orleans has become a hotbed of artists, collectors, scholars and entrepreneurs. It has been shown from Art Center in Los Angeles to the Central Academy of Fine Arts in Beijing, drawing thousands of visitors. Now it's New Orleans' turn. 
The Great Picture at PhotoNOLA 2013 will be a landmark exhibition of a landmark photograph. PhotoNOLA is now in its 8th year and is already a preeminent, internationally recognized photo festival. Bringing The Great Picture here to the city further cements PhotoNOLA's reputation as an active partner in the photography community both here in the Gulf Coast region and nationwide. 
When the opportunity to bring The Great Picture to NOLA arose we thought: ""How can we make this happen?"" From that point onward, seemingly overwhelming odds and a host of discouraging logistical and technical issues simply ceased to hold any sway over the determination to extract what is possible from the improbable. 
The Great Picture is more than the physical artifact labeled as “the world’s largest photograph;"" it is a tangible expression of the human spirit. What better place than New Orleans to make this point?
Great, how can I help?
Well, we have already raised $7,000 to cover the 40-foot over-the-road truck from Los Angeles, forklifts and boom lifts, crating and equipment. Now we need to fund rigging, custom lighting, special exhibition production, travel expenses (and plenty of odds and ends). This is no ordinary photograph. It weighs 1,800 pounds and will require many hands to install; exhibitions are akin to heavy construction.
So you can help by donating of course, but you can also help by simply spreading the word for us and sharing this campaign with your friends and neighbors. 

Who are the folks behind this?
The Legacy Project Team:

Jerry BurchfieldJerry Burchfield (d. 2009) was known as an environmental artist who among his other numerous awards was the recipient of a National Endowment for the Arts award.  Internationally known and loved, he used traditional and alternative applications of photography, light painting, performance, video, extended documentation and dedicated himself to long term projects in an on-going effort to make work that documented change over time, created an awareness of natural beauty, and addressed humanity's teetering relationship with nature.
Mark ChamberlainOwner and director of BC Space, the longest standing photographic gallery in Southern California, Mark Chamberlain is an artist, curator and writer who has focused on environmental issues throughout the southland. Exhibited and collected world-wide, his projects include the Laguna Canyon Project, Future Fossils and Looking for 2000 as well as numerous books and publications.
Jacques GarnierPhotographer, artist, lecturer and  documentarian, Jacques Garnier has concentrated on the urban distribution of the American landscape and as importantly, man's relationship to his environment - be it physical or psychological. He has co-authored a number of books and has an exhibition record that includes the Smithsonian, LACMA, Southeast Museum of Photography and CAFA in Beijing.
Douglas McCullohDouglas McCulloh is a photographer, writer, and curator who lives in Southern California. He is the author of five books and has an international exhibition record that includes Victoria and Albert Museum, London: Central Academy of Fine Arts, Beijing: Musée de l'Elyée, Lausanne: Musée Nicéphore Niépce, France; La Triennale di Milano, Italy; and Centro de la Imagen, Mexico City. He is an honors graduate of the University of California, Santa Barbara and holds an MFA from Claremont Graduate University.
Robert JohnsonnPhotographer, musician, printmaker and educator, Robert Johnson personal work is largely landscape based and explores how reality is perceived and sometimes altered through photography. He is currently the department chair of Cypress College and has exhibited throughout the United States.
Clayton SpadaClayton Spada has exhibited in Britain, Canada, Europe, the People’s Republic of China and the United States, and his works held in several institutional collections, including the Digital Media Studio, University of California, Riverside/California Museum of Photography (UCR/CMP); Doheny Libraries Special Collections, University of Southern California; Fisher Museum of Art, University of Southern California; Guggenheim Gallery, Chapman University, Orange, California; Huan Tie Museum, Beijing, People’s Republic of China; Lehigh University Art Galleries, Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.
The New Orleans Team:

Sesthasak Boonchai
Sesthasak Boonchai, is an artist,  educator and premedia specialist based in New Orleans, LA. He has taught at the New Orleans Center for the Creative Arts, Tulane University , The University of New Orleans and The School of Visual Arts in New York. His work has been featured in exhibitions at The Mississippi Museum of Art, The New Orleans Museum of Art, Colorado Springs Fine Arts Center, The Ogden Museum of Southern Art, and The Contemporary Art Center (New Orleans). He has also had a number of solo exhibitions throughout the United States.
Currently he is the Project manager for the IMLS Digitization project at the New Orleans Museum of Art and President of the New Orleans Photo Alliance. 

Brian GauvinBrian has been involved in many aspects of photography since he was inspired by Antonioni’s film, “Blow-Up,” in the late 1960s. That shallow beginning developed into a passion and ultimately something of a living, primarily as a photographer of travel and workboats, who occasionally bumbles into an image that might be considered art.
I have had the opportunity to stand before the Great Picture and I can say that it is an inspiring and uplifting experience to see the scale and textural quality of the object, and feel Its connection to the birth of photography. Those are only a couple of reasons why I urge you to get involved with bringing the Great Picture to New Orleans so that more people can see and feel and understand that sometimes we create objects that are greater than ourselves.

<p>
</p>
<p>WONDER MACHINE is a present day proto­cinematic event. It shall marry two paramounts of moving image
history—the zoetrope and the drive­in—in an all but abandoned sub­development in Belen, New Mexico. It will be
a collaboration between Chicago­based artists <a href=""courtneyprokopas.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Courtney Prokopas</a> and <a href=""http://www.keramackenzie.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Kera MacKenzie</a>, working with Deborah

<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The moving image inside the zoetrope will grapple with the laws of the universe behaving badly. In the spirit of the
Mystery Spot, and its variously trademarked roadside attraction cousins, gravity will act upon a glass of water but be
defied by an ever present slant. The glass will try and right the gravity line, to no avail, in an
endless loop, or until the viewers choose to physically stop it. This image conjures questions of water rights and
resource scarcity, but rests in a place of a poetics that avoids didacticism. </p>
<p>

<p>WONDER MACHINE will take place in Belen, New Mexico on a .71 acre plot just east of Route 47 in the Canyon
Del Rio community. The land was purchased via eBay, sight unseen, in 2011 by one of the artists for the price of
$1. Both of the artists have spent only passing times in the southwest, the purpose of those trips being recreation

<h3>...I, too, am an artist and don't have any moolah right now, can I still help?</h3>
<p>Yes! Just because you can't contribute money doesn’t mean you can’t help!  It's a blessing and a curse that we are surrounded by proactive, creative, ambitious individuals.  We both know what it's like to get umpteen requests for various crowd-funded creative projects at once and then realize that we barely have enough to pay our own bills.  </p>
<p>So, even if you can only kick in a modest amount ($10 will get us about 100 miles closer to New Mexico) it would mean a whole heck of a lot to us!  We have some pretty killer incentives.  For instance, if you kick in $10 we'll bring you back a cool (dead) bug.  Kera has a real knack for finding cool things, so this is a pretty good deal...  $75 will get you a phenomenal artist's flip book.  </p>
<p>Please share far and wide with friends, family, neighors, strangers, bosses, students, lovers, haters, sk8rs, cops, robbers, and Uncle Moneybags.</p>
<p>Also, please send this to people you know in the greater South West.  We'd love to host your pals on our land for a night of camping and fantastical contemporary art happenings.  Stay tuned about the progress of WONDER MACHINE by checking out our <a href=""http://wondermachine2013.wordpress.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">blog</a>. </p>

...wait, what is High Desert Test Sites?
High Desert Test Sites is an art event unlike any other.  It supports experimental art that engages with the local environment and community.  They generate physical and conceptual spaces for art exploring the intersections between contemporary art and life at large.  In short, it's kind of a big deal and we are very excited and fortunate to be a part of this!



...I, too, am an artist and don't have any moolah right now, can I still help?
Yes! Just because you can't contribute money doesn’t mean you can’t help!  It's a blessing and a curse that we are surrounded by proactive, creative, ambitious individuals.  We both know what it's like to get umpteen requests for various crowd-funded creative projects at once and then realize that we barely have enough to pay our own bills.  
So, even if you can only kick in a modest amount ($10 will get us about 100 miles closer to New Mexico) it would mean a whole heck of a lot to us!  We have some pretty killer incentives.  For instance, if you kick in $10 we'll bring you back a cool (dead) bug.  Kera has a real knack for finding cool things, so this is a pretty good deal...  $75 will get you a phenomenal artist's flip book.  
Please share far and wide with friends, family, neighors, strangers, bosses, students, lovers, haters, sk8rs, cops, robbers, and Uncle Moneybags.
Also, please send this to people you know in the greater South West.  We'd love to host your pals on our land for a night of camping and fantastical contemporary art happenings.  Stay tuned about the progress of WONDER MACHINE by checking out our blog. 

We love each and every one of you ever-so much.",2.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<p>My name is Timm Hoff. I’m a sculptor, illustrator, writer and photographer. I’ve been an artist all my life and worked as an artist for more than 15 years. </p>
<p>Through the years my work has often been stories of people’s lives. </p>
<p>Around a year ago, a dear friend of mine passed away. He had collected hundreds of pairs of surplus boots in the months before he died.  Even before he passed, I could see the potential for art and storytelling in the huge boxes of boots.</p>
<p>In October of this year, I spent two days taking photos of the boots hung in the bleached white trees along the shore of Lake McConaughy in the Nebraska Sandhills. </p>
<p>These photos make up the bulk of this installation piece. They will line the walls of the gallery, surrounding actual trees from the lake with the boots hanging from them.</p>
<p>This is a tribute to my friend, Jim but also a tribute to life, the lives of those who walked in those boots and all those who view them.</p>
<p>The money raised from this project will go, primarily to the production of the eleven 40” x 60” black and white prints on heavy cotton rag and the mounting/framing for the photos. The remainder of the funds will be spent to help build the platform for the trees that will be placed in the center of the installation within the galleries.</p>
<p>In return for your help, I’m offering some thank you gifts. These include anything from signed, limited edition prints of the pieces in the show to custom commissioned art, which can be a sculpture, an illustration or digital piece. </p><p>Any extra money received will go toward making the project bigger and better and helping take it more places on tour. </p>
<p>All backers will receive a personal invitation to the show nearest them and the post-opening party. 10% of the funds received will be donated to the Kim Foundation, which works to prevent Suicide and to help those coping with the death of loved ones. You can read more about it here: <a href=""http://www.thekimfoundation.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.thekimfoundation.org/</a></p><p>Backers will also get frequent updates on the project and more perks through the coming year.</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Over 20 years ago I painted. They were very textural paintings. And at the time I worked as an assistant for a sculptor so I learned a bit about mold making and casting resin and plaster. With that knowledge my paintings morphed into relief sculptures. Extremely textural. Covered with figures and cars and palm trees and other architectural elements I had uncovered at the art supply store I had worked at. One of the pieces I made was called ""About a Thousand People"" and it was covered with about a thousand people of varying sizes. It was painted black. From a distance it was hard to distinguish what it was but as you got closer you could see people of all sizes, in different poses. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Fast forward to today and my adventures in glass. I make beads at the torch, fuse plates and bowls and tiles with a kiln and make mosaics with bits and pieces of glass and other interesting objects. Most of this is functional art. And now I'm starting to cast glass. That really excites me. The texture and the possibilities of repeatability also excites me. This will be my fine art. The glass figures you see in the picture are what I'm going to work with. I've had them for over 20 years and they look amazing in glass! I want to cast a lot of them...and I want to cast them to create an art piece that will be entered into a competition at Bullseye Glass in Portland, OR called Emerge for emerging glass kiln forming artists. And from all of this I can explore my art. And then share that knowledge...</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I teach most of the techniques I've described above. Glass bead making, fusing and slumping, mosaic work as well as jewelry making. I also want to teach casting. I need to do more...</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I'm always looking for new information regarding glass. It seems never ending, the knowledge that can be acquired. But as you acquire knowledge you must share it. This is why I teach art glass techniques. So with this project I will be able to provide something for myself, a means to truly pursue my fine art, and something for my students and potential students as I will be able to add another technique to what I teach. Glass casting is happening but the scope of it right now is restricted. The assistance received here will allow it to happen in my studio at a more rapid pace and on a larger scale. With better tools and equipment too.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>To facilitate the adventure being embarked on will require a few kilns, some electrical work, mold making tools and supplies and of course more glass. Actually a bunch of glass. But there are goodies for all of you. The figures that will be in my final art piece for Emerge will be made in singles and pairs and more for contributors to this project. For example, if you contribute $30 you'll get a single figure, male or female in glass. $50 will get you two. $100 will get you five but there's more on that below. The pieces for contributors will be made from recycled bottles so there will be a few different colors to choose from. Good for you and the environment. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I'm also offering discounted classes. Such as a glass bead making class that would normally cost $125 for a $60 contribution. Fused glass coasters which is normally $75 will be $35. And even a future glass casting class that would be 2 days and is projected to cost $250 for a contribution of $120. And for those of you only able to kick in a little bit there will be some of my beaded goodies for rewards. $10 will get you a cupcake on a cchain...$20 will get you a slice of cake or pie on a chain. They're pretty cute.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>And for those of you interested in helping in other ways, spread the word. Tell a friend...get a set of figures for your friends and then they'll tell a friend...and so on and so on and so on!!</p>

<h3>Thank you to everybody who has supported our campaign! </h3>
<p> <br/>Although we didn't quite reach our target the money we did raise will certainly help S1 on the road to recovery, so thank you to everybody for your very generous donations!</p>
<p>We'll keep you posted about updates on our situation!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thanks from all at S1 Artspace x</p>

<h3>ABOUT S1 ARTSPACE</h3>
<p>S1 Artspace is a non-profit charity that provides a free gallery space dedicated to contemporary art as well as affordable studio spaces for artists and creative businesses based in Sheffield.</p>
<p>S1 was founded by artists who simply wanted a decent space to work in Sheffield's city centre and in 2003 a dedicated gallery space was established. Through our exhibitions programme we support and present work by both emerging and established artists and have a strong commitment to commissioning new work. <br/><br/></p>
<p><img alt=""S1 Artspace"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.s1artspace.org/eflyers/premises.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left;"" title=""S1 Artspace""/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Since 1995, we've continued to grow. In 2010 we relocated to Trafalgar House, a 16,000 sq ft industrial building across two floors, which has allowed us to be more ambitious with our exhibitions programme and provide much better quality studio spaces. </p>
<p>Over the past few years, we have presented solo and group exhibitions with Berlin based, Haegue Yang, who represented South Korea in the 2009 Venice Biennale;  Keith Wilson, co curator of British Sculpture at the Royal Academy, London 2010;  LA based Jennifer West, who exhibits from LA to Australia via Germany, Canada and Alaska;  Berlin based, Eva Berendes;  Glasgow based Turner Prize Shortlist, Karla Black;  Paris and London based Documenta 13, participant Jessica Warboys and New York artist Melissa Gordon, amongst many many more. <br/><br/>Over our history we have exhibited work by 700 artists, presented 70 exhibitions, commissioned 55 new artworks, accommodated 115 studio holders and attracted an audience of 30,000 visitors. <br/><br/><br/><strong>Your support will ensure that our work can continue into 2013 and beyond.</strong></p>

ABOUT S1 ARTSPACE
S1 Artspace is a non-profit charity that provides a free gallery space dedicated to contemporary art as well as affordable studio spaces for artists and creative businesses based in Sheffield.
S1 was founded by artists who simply wanted a decent space to work in Sheffield's city centre and in 2003 a dedicated gallery space was established. Through our exhibitions programme we support and present work by both emerging and established artists and have a strong commitment to commissioning new work. 

 
Since 1995, we've continued to grow. In 2010 we relocated to Trafalgar House, a 16,000 sq ft industrial building across two floors, which has allowed us to be more ambitious with our exhibitions programme and provide much better quality studio spaces. 
Over the past few years, we have presented solo and group exhibitions with Berlin based, Haegue Yang, who represented South Korea in the 2009 Venice Biennale;  Keith Wilson, co curator of British Sculpture at the Royal Academy, London 2010;  LA based Jennifer West, who exhibits from LA to Australia via Germany, Canada and Alaska;  Berlin based, Eva Berendes;  Glasgow based Turner Prize Shortlist, Karla Black;  Paris and London based Documenta 13, participant Jessica Warboys and New York artist Melissa Gordon, amongst many many more. Over our history we have exhibited work by 700 artists, presented 70 exhibitions, commissioned 55 new artworks, accommodated 115 studio holders and attracted an audience of 30,000 visitors. Your support will ensure that our work can continue into 2013 and beyond.

<p>Fireworks Collective are a group of 40 fire performers and crew from all over the UK. We first travelled to America to be part of the Fire Conclave at Burning Man ( <a href=""http://www.burningman.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.burningman.com/</a> ) in 2009 with 8 fire performers. We remain the only British troupe to regularly be part of the Fire Conclave, representing UK fire spinning creativity at this unique event.</p>
<p>This year the group is led by Zoe (Shin)  and Kay (Shin Assist). Zoe &amp; Kay are both experienced fire performers that joined the Collective in 2011, and are now taking the lead in planning this year’s performance. They are small people with BIG ideas, and want to create a show that is going to stand out and allow the creative skills of all performers and creators in the group to really shine in a unique way.</p>
<p><em><strong> The featured video is our 2011 submission to Conclave Burning man.</strong><br/></em></p>
<p><em><strong>OUR GOAL....</strong></em></p>
<p>In 2012, we are devising a performance based on the Celtic festival of Beltane.  We want to build on what we have created before, and make the 2012 performance more spectacular than anything we have done before.  We are already hard at work choreographing and rehearsing our performance, which features gods, goddesses, the May Queen, fairies, woodland frolicking and many other Beltane traditions. Essentially, we are hoping to take a little slice of rural British folklore to the Nevada desert. ON FIRE!<br/><br/>We are determined to push our art forwards in new ways.  In order to do this we are hoping to develop some unique fire props, which are directly linked to the Celtic Beltane traditions.  We have the ideas and the skilled craftspeople to put them into action. What we are seeking from you, is help to buy the materials we need to turn these ideas into reality, and transport them across the globe to share them with the international fire-spinning community at Burning Man.</p>
<p><em><strong>WHAT WE NEED....</strong></em></p>
<p>Although we are developing our performance to a professional standard, we do this as a gift to our community in the UK, and the USA. All members of the Collective are expected to fund their own transport to the USA and in-country costs, other than transporting equipment and props. This is being met from personal savings, and individual fundraising.</p>
<p>We are looking for help with the costs of the costumes for the performers. We currently have around 35 performers in our troupe, and are seeking a minimal amount to cover materials. Members of our group are skilled costumiers, and can create incredible things on a shoestring budget, but clothing 35 people means that we <em>really</em> need some help with this!</p>
<p>Finally, we are hoping to raise enough money to help with fuel and safety equipment, which have to be purchased on arrival in the US, and for fuel for rehearsals in the UK.</p>
<p>The critical assistance we are seeking is outlined below. This funding is sought entirely to support development and performance of this unique piece of fire art.</p>

<p><em><strong>THE BENEFITS....</strong></em></p>
<p>Our small UK fireworks collective has grown into a family through the love of self expression.We have opened up new possibilities to people from all walks of life, taught skills to some that never thought it possible and helped them develop a confidence in all aspects of their lives. From performance to meeting new people, sharing ideas and building lifelong bridges in a worldwide community where people can share their passion, we would love to share our journey with you and give you the opportunity to express yourself with us.</p>
<p>Our aspirations for the future are to collaborate all aspects of our ethos and bring our passion of teaching and learning through workshops accessible for all, not just in the UK but worldwide, to infinity and beyond...</p>
<p> <strong>During this campaign we will keep you up-to-date with our progress, made from the funding, with video and picture stories showing the development of the props, and how we are putting them to use in our performance - and, <em>eventually</em> our 2012 video submission !!!! </strong></p>
<p><strong>We are <em>so</em> excited to be working together to create this beautiful, forward-thinking project, and we are really looking forward to sharing with you the results of all our hard work, by letting this project reach its full potential. </strong></p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Jonas Freeman. I have a beautiful wife and 5 year old son. I am a waiter at a pizza place, and my wife works for a fence co. Although our bank acounts are lacking, our lives are very rich with family, friends, and positivity. Recently my wife, Tonya asked our son Isaiah what he wanted to do when he grows up. His answer was that he wanted to do what dad does, which is flattering but we want better, haha. On second thought, he said that he wouldnt just be a waiter. He would be a server in a place of his own, and an artist, using his resaurant as a place to show and sell his art. We are in love with this idea.</p>
<p>Not having any funds to get started, I of course looked to a close friends for help and thoughts. My friend has a great wife and two daughters, one of which is autistic (wanting to clarify since I mentioned art. Thats autistic, not artistic) and in high school doing awesome., her name is Emma. While Emmas dad has a ton of resaurant managing experience and is willing to partner with me on this, he has no money either. As all parents wish for thier kids, Emma's dad, Chris has great dreams for Emma to one day be a full functioning adult with a higher education, job, and place of her own. Most know that parents with special needs kids have more of a challenge reaching these dreams. Which is why the more and more I think of my sons terrific goal I believe it is now more important than ever. </p>
<p>This place can achieve many huge things for many people. The vision is of a place in which our two families can partner together with each other and our children. Something that we can build up and give to them as a head start in life. Perhaps a place with an apartment for Emma, with built in job, and built in daily support from the restaurants staff which would be us. The meaning and worth of a chance for a special needs person to have this type of independent freedom is a value of which I am having trouble putting to words. Not to mention the peace of mind the parents would have by giving this freedom, but also being able to be there daily. Checking in, with out really ""checking in on her"" if you catch my drift. Our beautiful area that we live is a great inspiration for many great artists, and we hope to encourage this for the town, not just our son. A place for all to display their values, while filling their bellies and hearts. </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I have found a great place for sale which actually was a previous restaurant art gallery. It was called the Cottage Gallery. Its a commercial zoned house. Its located in Coeur d'Alene, Id. on the main strip of the town, Sherman Ave. Last price I saw for it was $130,000, of course being commercial it requires a large down. Also it needs some work and equipment which is why our campaign goals are so high. If these goals arent reached enough to get this business started the funds will go directly towards education for our kids. </p>
<p>This campaign has sparked a dream of doing so much more than just the initial idea. Hopefully it can turn into a Pay it Forward type of platform, perhaps offering free art classes, etc. Once this place is going I dont see a limit to what it can turn into. A place for people to see that if we (""we"" meaning you too) can do it, so can they. A place where we can give hope, and opportunity to others, whether your an artist, one with special needs, business entreprenuer, or ??. </p>
<p>The perk for this campaign comes from an artistic hobby that has lead me to turning my garage into an excellent screen print shop. I would like to offer screen printed T-shirt packages to raise the money. These shirts will be custom printed just for you. For your business, event, fun, etc. It will also include the value of logo creation and or editting if you need. I believe there is a great value in this perk. Something fun and useful for all, and most of you may have already had a previous need for it. Some perks offer discounts, art placement, and advertising. In the event that our goals arent met and we dont open a restaurant, I will return your art work at your request. As for the discounts and advertising via parkingspace sign etc. I will refund the perk amount difference for that particular portion. For example, if your perk is t-shirts, a plack on the wall, and parking space; I stil keep t-shirt money, but refund difference, and you still keep shirts. Im excited about this, and hope you are too!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I feel like people will want to get behind this goal even if they dont have a need or money for the perk. I am going to print some shirts to advertise our deam on and give them away to those of you who would like to help. Just send me a shirt size and self addressed envelope with postage paid to send it to you in. Thank You! </p>

<p>Doodles will be run by Alison Landoni, a local artist who not only wants to continue painting and selling her work, but also has bucket loads of adminstrative experience working in galleries, cultural non-profits such as Rockport Music and the Rockport Art Association and other smaller shops. She has also been trained in small business practices by the Entreprenurial Training Program in 2005.  She holds a BFA from Montserrat College of Art and has been the art teacher for the Clark School in Danvers for the past several years.</p>
<p>Basically, we've observed how to increase probability in sales while maintaining realistic expectations for this area.  True, tourism is seasonal, however there are still local residents who can also benefit from what we offer, therefore we have created 3 streams of potential income, based on our 3 strengths, to keep ourselves afloat.</p>
<p>Most importantly, we are passionate about making this work, here, in Rockport and want to help keep the arts alive and thriving here on Cape Ann.</p>

<br/><h2>DOODLES' COMPOSITION</h2>
<p>Here are the key components that make up Doodles Art Emporium:</p>
<h3>THE SHOP</h3>
<p>The Shop will carry quality drawing materials such as charcoals, pencils, crayons,  steel nibs and inks, as well as quality papers, sketchbooks, erasers.  Due to limited space, only some paints, preferably watercolors or gouache, will be carried.  Doodles will also provide artists with quality acid free paper – loose and in pads.  Easy purchase kits for the inspired traveler will provide a bundle of drawing tools at a discount.  Gift basket combos can also be purchased.</p>
<p>KEEPIN' IT REAL</p>
<p>Doodles will focus on providing materials that have little packaging and plastic.  This gives the customer control over the quantity of what they are purchasing with very little waste, while helping to stay green.</p>
<p>DOODLE-IN</p>
<p>Participation and interaction keeps places vibrant and fresh! The Shop will also have an interactive doodle board where visitors add to a large weekly doodle which will be photographed and posted onto various online social networks.  An additional idea is that someone can bid on the drawing and ½ the proceeds will go to a non-profit organization of their choice.</p>
<h3>WORKSHOPS</h3>
<p>We will offer the public an opportunity for one on one drawing classes or small group workshops based on drawing and sketching as well as creative discussion groups and lively evenings with drawing games.  Some afternoons might feature an after school program to help high school students build their portfolio.  Young students perusing individual instruction will need to go through an interview process.</p>
<h3>THE GALLERY</h3>
<p>The Gallery will feature the dynamic LandWick Trio: the fine art of Doodles’ owner, Alison Landoni, the amazing pen and ink work of, Ben Wickey, and some hilarious cartoon antics by Jim Wickey.  At times, The Gallery may present works featuring students or participants of a particular workshop or class. </p>

<h3>THE STUDIO</h3>
<p>Every artist needs a place to incubate and create. The Studio will be a working studio for Alison Landoni.  This will allow her to spend time working on her art during store hours.  It may also serve as teaching space for individual instruction.</p>
<h3>MARKETING</h3>
<p>We have a good 3 year marketing strategy in place that should spark excitement but not break the bank!</p>
<p>STRATEGY</p>
<p>The first three years, Doodles will be geared towards setting strong roots in the local merchant and arts communities.  Building a loyal clientele, showing the larger community a commitment to customer service and creating a local presence will be some of the key foundational elements for success.</p>
<p>Most successful establishments in downtown Rockport have regular operating hours.  When the public sees the lights on and the open sign in the window, over and over again, it builds confidence that the business is committed to serve its customers. It communicates that the business is alive and thriving, and the probability of sales is thus increased. </p>
<p>Doodles has multiple streams of income: drawing supplies, classes and workshops, and gallery sales.  This offers an opportunity, and increased probability, for income during the “off” season.  I must say, being a local, I really like when I don't have to drive 20 miles out of the way in the snow for charcoal, but that's just me.</p>
<p>NOW SOME FORMAL GOBBLDEYGOOP ABOUT THE OWNER AND WHY SHE CAN PULL THIS OFF!</p>
<p>Alison Landoni brings a over 20 years of combined experience as an artist, gallery assistant, shop keeper, bookkeeper, graphic designer and art teacher to Doodles.  She has worked for several Rockport shops, organizations and galleries including Rockport Music as the Assistant to the Capital Campaign, The Rockport Art Association as an Interim Bookkeeper, The Mercury Gallery as the Assistant to the Director and as a Gallery Assistant at the Tusinski Gallery.</p>
<p>Ms. Landoni has taught art over the years both locally through Art Harbor, and more recently as the Art Teacher for the Clark School in Danvers, MA instructing students grades K-12.</p>
<p>She has completed the ETP (Entrepreneurial Training Program) in 2005 through Northern Essex Community College and Jermain and Associates and holds a BFA from Montserrat College of Art. She is also a trained television puppeteer, actress, and singer.</p>
<p>Ms. Landoni has assisted several local organizations with her graphic design, and audio/video expertise.</p>
<p>She is the author and illustrator of her self published children’s book, <em>A Place for Spooz</em>.  She also created the main character, Spooz the Cat, as a puppet that appeared in short online PSAs. </p>
<p>Ms. Landoni was a co-writer, performer, and editor for <em>The Green House</em>, a campy family-friendly independent sitcom. </p>
<p>This combined experience enhances Ms. Landoni’s congenial personality with all whom she encounters and her respect for Cape Ann’s rich history, culture and it’s support of the arts.  Her ability to have long range vision for a vibrant and thriving small business in Rockport will be due to this adeptness behind the scenes.</p>

<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Sunset Arts </b>is a visual arts afterschool program that starts with what is unique to each participant. At the heart of Sunset Arts is the individual: through a series of 12 original art lessons each child will be encouraged to find their own particular and personally arrived at artworks. <br/></p>

<h4><b>About the founder and teacher</b></h4>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Matt Samolewicz is an artist and teacher living in the Sunset Park 
neighborhood of Brooklyn. He has an MFA in Visual Arts from Rutgers 
University and a Master of Arts in Teaching from Smith College. He loves
 to teach, loves to facilitate the making of artwork, and he cannot wait

<br/><br/><h4><b>The Art</b></h4>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The most important part. In this program, art is a vehicle for kids to realize a personalized relationship with the world. The goal of Sunset Arts is to nurture highly individualized perspectives within our participants as a means to learn about oneself and, with time, to learn about how we each best contribute to our community. Here are some examples of artworks made by Matt's students:</p>

<h4><b>What Sunset Arts is asking for your help with</b></h4>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Sunset Arts has found a cozy and reasonable art-making space in an amazing building in the Gowanus neighborhood of Brooklyn. We are seeking support for the funding needed to secure the space and for the very basic materials we need to get our work started.</p>

<p><i>The building</i></p>
<br/>
<p>Specifically, the rental rate for our space is $15/hr for the first 5 hours of each calendar month, and $10/hr for every hour afterward. Sunset Arts plans to run Tuesdays and Thursdays 3-5PM September 15th - December 10th, excluding the week of Thanksgiving, which amounts to 12 weeks and 24 afternoons. The total price for renting the space, along with a small deposit, is $615. This is the major cost we are looking to friends, family, and well-wishers for as this is the amount we need to have a space to make art this fall!

</div></div>","About Sunset Arts:

Sunset Arts is a visual arts afterschool program that starts with what is unique to each participant. At the heart of Sunset Arts is the individual: through a series of 12 original art lessons each child will be encouraged to find their own particular and personally arrived at artworks. 





About the founder and teacher

Matt Samolewicz is an artist and teacher living in the Sunset Park 
neighborhood of Brooklyn. He has an MFA in Visual Arts from Rutgers 
University and a Master of Arts in Teaching from Smith College. He loves
 to teach, loves to facilitate the making of artwork, and he cannot wait
 to see his newest project grow legs and make some beautiful and interesting contributions to the Brooklyn community.


The Art

The most important part. In this program, art is a vehicle for kids to realize a personalized relationship with the world. The goal of Sunset Arts is to nurture highly individualized perspectives within our participants as a means to learn about oneself and, with time, to learn about how we each best contribute to our community. Here are some examples of artworks made by Matt's students:

</h3>
<p>I'm Katie. I am 28 years old and I love to tell stories. About anything and everything -- where things sit in my brain, my memories, and how they got there. This could be anything from my religious upbringing in a big-small city in Missouri, being raised by a misogynist who loved mo-town and a super hero teacher mom, my adventures as a fat queer woman, to my present-day professional art practice and teaching kids arts, crafts, and kindness here in Portland. <br/></p>
<p>I have been storytelling for, well, my whole life really, but in a professional art-sense for about 3 years now. I have told stories, done comedy and character performance on the stage, in festivals, on the street, in the bar, and a few times internationally. <br/></p>
<p>I've been interested in the idea of a storytelling album for a long time. But this album, THE OZARK YARD, would be an experiment for me, and a new adventure in the realm of the tangible and non-tangible art object, and a project being funded by fans for fans.</p>
<p><b>Project Breakdown:</b><br/></p>
<p>This storytelling album will be hand-made, burned and produced by me. It will be a 10 to 12 track album. There will also be a limited edition DVD companion as well as a hand-made booklet bundle. [see perks for even more details!] <br/></p>Some of the stories included on this album will be:<br/><ul>
<li>""I like you...but you're big"" a Body Love Story </li>
<li>Jerry vs. Fatass: a Bachelorette Party Story<br/>
</li>
<li>Crying Over Spilled Lasagna and My First Real Period at 28</li>
<li>That Time I Met Madonna's Hairdresser: An Old Annie Saga</li>
<li>Sexism &amp; Dead Birds <br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to produce this album, I will need funding for:</p>

<li>a podcast microphone with USB capabilities</li>
<li>DVD/CDs to burn</li>
<li>a portable DVD/CD burner</li>
<li>postage to send it right to your door</li>
<li>paper, thread, glue -- to create the booklets</li>
<li>a 75$ annual membership fee (one-time) to the Independent Publishing Resource Center here in Portland. Buying a membership at the IPRC gives the member the advantage of printing in their fantastic facility, takes down the printing charge of a color print, and supports a local art business here in Portland -- everyone wins with the IPRC!</li>
<li>an artist fee for myself so I can keep livin', eatin', and thrivin'. ""Starving Artist"" is a very real reality these days.</li>
</ul>Beyond the limited edition DVD/CD/Booklet bundle [see perks for even more details!], there will be a special opportunity to buy a limited number of tickets to come to a series of ""House Shows"" at my house here in Portland. These shows will take place after the campaign is over (I'm thinking end of July or early August -- look for the event invite/email/carrier pigeon!) and I have all the supplies I need. <br/><br/>Often in the art community, I am told the opinion that if a performance is comedic or entertaining in any way, then it is not a work of ""fine art."" I disagree with this wholeheartedly. I believe that to get up in front of a crowd and share humorous and possibly devastating/dark information with one's body and voice IS a work of fine art and a work of fine strength.  <br/><br/>With YOUR HELP, I believe we can prove this with the objects, booklets, and shows created from this adventure I have dubbed THE OZARK YARD.<br/><br/>Thank you for reading this and for supporting my mischief.

<p><b>Thanks for visiting TrulyMine campaign page. Let us tell you our story:</b></p>
<p><b>Andy Werner</b>: I came up with this idea, because I wasn’t able to find a notebook for myself. I was looking for something that would respect the way I work in a simple way. Then I realized I am not the only one searching for the right notekeeping solution.</p>
<p><b><span></span>Jakub Svehla</b>: True, I’ve always carried a bunch of notebooks in my bag—each for a different purpose...</p>
<p><b>Erik Werner</b>: A lot of us keep looking for the “Perfect Notebook”. But the truth is that requirements of each of us are different and that there is no silver bullet.</p>
<p><b>Andy</b>: I tried to experiment with my own solutions. Of course in a pretty much DIY mode like making sections in purchased blank notebooks or printing my own inserts. But soon I realized that I am onto something and that there is so much more to this.</p>
<p><b>Erik</b>: So we started working on a full concept. And here we are ready to share it with you. Let’s start building the TrulyMine community now. We want to get to know you!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1446730990/m5kbszarxqh0mosdbpdr.png"" src="""" style=""width: 100%;""/></p>

<div style=""margin: 30px;"">
<p><b><span></span>Jakub</b>: We wanted to find a solution that keeps all your activities in one place. So you don’t have to keep your notes in multiple notepads, but in a one that has all you need. </p>
<p><b>Andy</b>: We soon realized that perfect notebook is not created by nice cover, but by content which is inside. And by content we mean not only the printed layout, but what you actually write in it as well. If these two are in sync, you have a notebook that works for you and not vice-versa.</p>
<p><b>Erik</b>: Yeah and that is exactly what TrulyMine is about. We give you the opportunity to select pages that you personally like. That go well with your way of thinking, perception of time and your style of note-taking.</p>
<p><b>Andy</b>: This is what makes TrulyMine stand out. Instead of giving you one approach and claiming it is perfect, we give you infinite number of options to fine tune your optimal notebook. This is the first notebook that adapts to you, so you become faster, smarter, stronger.</p>
<p><b>Jakub</b>: Like me (haha)</p>
</div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1446730773/wwthzuvnxs9pvahh9byc.png"" src="""" style=""width: 100%;""/></p>
<div style=""margin: 30px;"">
<p><b>Erik</b>: A lot of people had already gone digital with their note taking and calendar needs. Others swear by the good old pen and paper. We merged the best of both worlds.</p>
<p><b>Andy</b>: Internet and digitalization allow you to define your products before they actually get produced. </p>
<p><b>Jakub</b>: Haha, yes, you can customize everything nowadays, from pizza to sneakers! We took the same approach here: you simply jump to our website, put pages together and wait for your notebook to arrive in a few days.</p>
<p><b>Erik</b>: The website is almost ready and it is pretty straightforward to use. First you look at the details of pages available and you drag and drop the ones you like into your future notebook. Then just rearrange the order and decide on the number of pages you want to use.</p>
<p><b>Andy</b>: You can imagine it as if you were creating a table of contents. We paid special attention to keeping it real simple and we are sure you will like it.</p>
<b>Jakub</b>: Our project video has already given you a good flavour of how it looks.

<div style=""margin: 30px;"">
<p><b>Andy</b>: You have probably figured it out by now: you can buy a notebook that is made for one very special person: You.</p>
<p><b>Erik</b>: You create a structure that you are really going to use. Having selected the content yourself, you don’t have to repurpose pages in the back of your planner anymore.</p>
<p><b>Jakub</b>: And all the loose paper notes scattered all over your table can now have their own proper place… And I mean proper — by choosing the order of the pages yourself, you can organize your notebook according to your own formula.</p>
<p><b>Erik</b>: Calendar first then todo list? Or the other way around? 20 or 40 blank pages? It is your call, choose whatever works for you.</p>
<p><b>Andy</b>: Jakub has already designed essential layouts from the ground up to make sure that you have everything you are used to.</p>
<p><b>Jakub</b>: And besides these essentials, we also have some extras ready and the range will always be expanding.</p>

<div style=""margin: 30px;"">
<p><b>Erik</b>: Contributors are actually the most important part of our concept. They are members of TrulyMine community and they bring diversity into your notebooks. </p>
<p><b>Andy</b>: When we started with TrulyMine it was clear that we wanted to go beyond the basic layouts. But there was a question: how to decide which topics are relevant and who will actually draft those pages? We didn’t want to create content that we didn’t understand.</p>
<p><b>Erik</b>: We asked friends and people we knew to come up with layouts for the topics that they were interested in. They were either professionals or just enthusiasts, but they definitely knew more than us about these subjects.</p>
<p><b>Jakub</b>: We have quite a few friends, but we know there is much more people, who would like to contribute and share their insights. And that’s why we started this Indiegogo – to connect with contributors from all around the world.</p>
</div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1446816959/usmwnj3c39txdr1k9niu.png"" src="""" style=""width: 100%;""/></p>
<div style=""margin: 30px;"">
<p><b>Erik</b>: With various contributors on board, TrulyMine expands horizons of your note taking. Our approach is built on diversity of themes, authors and techniques. This diversity is here for one purpose: to build a notebook that is really yours.</p>
<p><b>Jakub</b>: The variability of content will allow you to work with your notepad in a truly new way. You can record notes on topics, that rarely find a place in a regular notebook such as logging dreams, or keeping track of stuff you have lent to others.</p>
<p><b>Andy</b>: Personally I am eager to explore new productivity hacks. Other people’s ideas on how to plan time, keep to-do lists, store meeting minutes, etc are priceless. But usually hidden. TrulyMine will get you behind these curtains so you can get a headstart into your day.</p>
<p><b>Erik</b>: The same goes of course for your free time. Our layouts can be great inspiration to your passions and hobbies. Like how you prepare for your half-marathon, how you keep recipes or how you note your wine tastings.</p>
<p><b>Jakub</b>: Besides inspiration, TrulyMine layouts may help you learn new things. Regular and structured review is essential, but sometimes difficult to do. In your TrulyMine you can keep few pages to store info on your progress – like number of pushups you make, or how did your last trip go – whatever. I am making this up, but you get the idea.</p>
</div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1446832805/djeypcj4crgcnpsw1zmr.png"" src="""" style=""width: 100%;""/></p>
<div style=""margin: 30px;"">
<p><b>Erik</b>: TrulyMine is as strong as its contributors and their ideas. Sometimes we lack the knowledge of a topic. Sometimes we have it, but don’t want to force our perspective on you.</p>
<p><b>Andy</b>: Therefore we want you to participate. We want you to tell us what you need in your notebook and we will process the rest. </p>
<p><b>Jakub</b>: It really doesn’t matter who you are. We believe you have something to say. You can be a coach, teacher, professional in specific field or pure enthusiast. Maybe you will be motivated by the appreciation of others, maybe you would love to share something you have discovered. Maybe you just really want to have your own layout. In any case you can become a TrulyMine contributor.</p>

<div style=""margin: 30px;"">
<p><b>Jakub</b>: It is very easy for contributors to create their own pages. They just briefly describe their usage needs to us. We propose various approaches and we decide together on the specific fields of the layout. We will then translate it into our signature design.</p>
<p><b>Andy</b>: This means that all the layouts play nicely together, despite having various authors. You can be sure that TrulyMine will be a smooth experience from cover to cover.</p>

<p><span>We worked hard in the background to make sure we will be able to fulfill our promises. We have already procured key elements of our supply chain on the software and hardware side. </span></p>
<p>Two missing pieces of puzzle that are not in place yet (and for which we are seeking financing) are a heavy duty puncher and development of the web-app backend. If the the campaign is not financed in full extent we might have longer delivery times after order receipt.</p>
<p>We had produced multiple batches of prototypes and tested the production and assembly process. We estimate that orders will arrive at a gradual pace. In case of a  larger simultaneous batch, we would need to review the process, which might cause delay.</p>We are a small team and everyone has a unique skillset so it is difficult to substitute each other. Emergencies can then lead to delay in delivery. We also work with limited number of sub-suppliers, so this is valid to them as well. But no need to worry, we are young and exercise regularly!</div>

<div style=""margin: 30px;"">
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><b>What is the size of the notebook? Is that only variety?</b></span></p>
<p></p>
<blockquote>The size is very close to a classic A5 format. This is the most common size people use, so we decided to start with it. We wanted to make sure our production process is simple and reliable therefore we opted for one size. We are sorry to let fans of pocket sized or oversized notepads down, but adding format variability is on to do list.</blockquote>
<p>
<b>How many pages are there in the notebook?</b></p>
<p></p>
<blockquote>Every TrulyMine comes with 160 pages. That is 80 sheets of paper. You can use them up in any combination you want. If you select less pages, we will add blanks to the end to complete the 160.</blockquote>
<p><b>What paper do you use?</b></p>
<p></p>
<blockquote>We use 120g Munken paper made in Sweden. It is uncoated paper of fine quality. The layout printed from the other side doesn't shine through and your ink won't bleed through either. Oh and it is FSC and PEFC certified, so you don't have to feel bad about using paper notebooks in 2015.</blockquote>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>How will I add layouts into my notebook?</b></p>
<p></p>
<blockquote>In our online workshop. You start with an empty notebook and you drag and drop layouts into it. Reorder and then you add the completed notebook to the cart. It is a satisfying process. </blockquote>
<p><b>What are premium layouts?</b></p>
<p></p>
<blockquote>Premium layouts are content that hold extraordinary value. TrulyMine isn't only about empty fields and we want to encourage authors to offer unique know-how to our users. </blockquote>
<p><b>Do premium layouts cost extra?</b></p>
<p></p>
<blockquote>Premium layouts will be priced on top of the notebook base (which includes all free layouts). However users will pay only the first time they order any given premium layout as they are entitled to unlimited reprints of it. Indiegogo backers receive all premium layouts created before July 2016 for free.</blockquote>
<p><b>What topics are suitable for layout contribution?</b></p>
<p></p>
<blockquote>Whatever is close to you! Some contributors have created their way of taking notes for their field of work or interest. Others want to give hints what to log to others. In general any topic revolving around productivity, sports, food, culture, journaling or personal growth will be useful to the community.</blockquote>
<p><b>Can I consult my layout idea before buying the perk?</b></p>
<p></p>
<blockquote>Of course! Email us anytime at hello-at-trulymine.ink or send us a message through Indiegogo. We can call each other and we can talk about your idea. That way you can get a taste of how the Contributor sessions work.</blockquote>
<p><b>Can I become a contributor after the IndieGoGo campaign is over? How will it work?</b></p>
<p></p>
<blockquote>Yes. We will always be looking for new contributors. However, joining now has a big advantage - you get to be first to work on your topic and you can set the standard. We will always be gracious to the original backers and their content will be featured more prominently in our store.</blockquote>
<p><b>Do I need special equipment to open the reclosable spine?</b></p>
<p></p>
<blockquote>No, you can easily open the spine with your fingers. There is also a special trick to open it really fast, using a pen.</blockquote>
<p><b>Will I receive my TrulyMine before Holidays?</b></p>
<p></p>
<blockquote>In Mid-December you will receive a voucher code to enter our website so you or your firends can start crafting their notebook right after the christmas dinner. You can place order anytime, we will start shipping first orders beginning of January.</blockquote>

Thanks for visiting TrulyMine campaign page. Let us tell you our story:

Andy: I tried to experiment with my own solutions. Of course in a pretty much DIY mode like making sections in purchased blank notebooks or printing my own inserts. But soon I realized that I am onto something and that there is so much more to this.

Erik: Yeah and that is exactly what TrulyMine is about. We give you the opportunity to select pages that you personally like. That go well with your way of thinking, perception of time and your style of note-taking.
Andy: This is what makes TrulyMine stand out. Instead of giving you one approach and claiming it is perfect, we give you infinite number of options to fine tune your optimal notebook. This is the first notebook that adapts to you, so you become faster, smarter, stronger.
Jakub: Like me (haha)



Erik: A lot of people had already gone digital with their note taking and calendar needs. Others swear by the good old pen and paper. We merged the best of both worlds.
Andy: Internet and digitalization allow you to define your products before they actually get produced. 
Jakub: Haha, yes, you can customize everything nowadays, from pizza to sneakers! We took the same approach here: you simply jump to our website, put pages together and wait for your notebook to arrive in a few days.
Erik: The website is almost ready and it is pretty straightforward to use. First you look at the details of pages available and you drag and drop the ones you like into your future notebook. Then just rearrange the order and decide on the number of pages you want to use.
Andy: You can imagine it as if you were creating a table of contents. We paid special attention to keeping it real simple and we are sure you will like it.
Jakub: Our project video has already given you a good flavour of how it looks.



Andy: You have probably figured it out by now: you can buy a notebook that is made for one very special person: You.
Erik: You create a structure that you are really going to use. Having selected the content yourself, you don’t have to repurpose pages in the back of your planner anymore.
Jakub: And all the loose paper notes scattered all over your table can now have their own proper place… And I mean proper — by choosing the order of the pages yourself, you can organize your notebook according to your own formula.
Erik: Calendar first then todo list? Or the other way around? 20 or 40 blank pages? It is your call, choose whatever works for you.
Andy: Jakub has already designed essential layouts from the ground up to make sure that you have everything you are used to.
Jakub: And besides these essentials, we also have some extras ready and the range will always be expanding.





Erik: Contributors are actually the most important part of our concept. They are members of TrulyMine community and they bring diversity into your notebooks. 
Andy: When we started with TrulyMine it was clear that we wanted to go beyond the basic layouts. But there was a question: how to decide which topics are relevant and who will actually draft those pages? We didn’t want to create content that we didn’t understand.
Erik: We asked friends and people we knew to come up with layouts for the topics that they were interested in. They were either professionals or just enthusiasts, but they definitely knew more than us about these subjects.
Jakub: We have quite a few friends, but we know there is much more people, who would like to contribute and share their insights. And that’s why we started this Indiegogo – to connect with contributors from all around the world.



Erik: With various contributors on board, TrulyMine expands horizons of your note taking. Our approach is built on diversity of themes, authors and techniques. This diversity is here for one purpose: to build a notebook that is really yours.
Jakub: The variability of content will allow you to work with your notepad in a truly new way. You can record notes on topics, that rarely find a place in a regular notebook such as logging dreams, or keeping track of stuff you have lent to others.
Andy: Personally I am eager to explore new productivity hacks. Other people’s ideas on how to plan time, keep to-do lists, store meeting minutes, etc are priceless. But usually hidden. TrulyMine will get you behind these curtains so you can get a headstart into your day.
Erik: The same goes of course for your free time. Our layouts can be great inspiration to your passions and hobbies. Like how you prepare for your half-marathon, how you keep recipes or how you note your wine tastings.
Jakub: Besides inspiration, TrulyMine layouts may help you learn new things. Regular and structured review is essential, but sometimes difficult to do. In your TrulyMine you can keep few pages to store info on your progress – like number of pushups you make, or how did your last trip go – whatever. I am making this up, but you get the idea.



Erik: TrulyMine is as strong as its contributors and their ideas. Sometimes we lack the knowledge of a topic. Sometimes we have it, but don’t want to force our perspective on you.
Andy: Therefore we want you to participate. We want you to tell us what you need in your notebook and we will process the rest. 
Jakub: It really doesn’t matter who you are. We believe you have something to say. You can be a coach, teacher, professional in specific field or pure enthusiast. Maybe you will be motivated by the appreciation of others, maybe you would love to share something you have discovered. Maybe you just really want to have your own layout. In any case you can become a TrulyMine contributor.



Jakub: It is very easy for contributors to create their own pages. They just briefly describe their usage needs to us. We propose various approaches and we decide together on the specific fields of the layout. We will then translate it into our signature design.
Andy: This means that all the layouts play nicely together, despite having various authors. You can be sure that TrulyMine will be a smooth experience from cover to cover.

PROJECT TIMELINE

OUR TEAM
Andy: I am the serious one in our ensemble. I own the master To-do list and make sure that all streams are in sync so we deliver our promise on time and within budget.
Erik: I navigate TrulyMine in the on-line world. I am also contributors' buddy: let me know about your layout ideas!
Jakub: And me? I've messed around with colors, shapes and stuff. And that's why everything now looks the way it does.



RISKS & CHALLENGES
We worked hard in the background to make sure we will be able to fulfill our promises. We have already procured key elements of our supply chain on the software and hardware side. 
Two missing pieces of puzzle that are not in place yet (and for which we are seeking financing) are a heavy duty puncher and development of the web-app backend. If the the campaign is not financed in full extent we might have longer delivery times after order receipt.
We had produced multiple batches of prototypes and tested the production and assembly process. We estimate that orders will arrive at a gradual pace. In case of a  larger simultaneous batch, we would need to review the process, which might cause delay.We are a small team and everyone has a unique skillset so it is difficult to substitute each other. Emergencies can then lead to delay in delivery. We also work with limited number of sub-suppliers, so this is valid to them as well. But no need to worry, we are young and exercise regularly!

Frequently Asked Questions

What is the size of the notebook? Is that only variety?

The size is very close to a classic A5 format. This is the most common size people use, so we decided to start with it. We wanted to make sure our production process is simple and reliable therefore we opted for one size. We are sorry to let fans of pocket sized or oversized notepads down, but adding format variability is on to do list.

How many pages are there in the notebook?

Every TrulyMine comes with 160 pages. That is 80 sheets of paper. You can use them up in any combination you want. If you select less pages, we will add blanks to the end to complete the 160.
What paper do you use?

We use 120g Munken paper made in Sweden. It is uncoated paper of fine quality. The layout printed from the other side doesn't shine through and your ink won't bleed through either. Oh and it is FSC and PEFC certified, so you don't have to feel bad about using paper notebooks in 2015.


How will I add layouts into my notebook?

In our online workshop. You start with an empty notebook and you drag and drop layouts into it. Reorder and then you add the completed notebook to the cart. It is a satisfying process. 
What are premium layouts?

Premium layouts are content that hold extraordinary value. TrulyMine isn't only about empty fields and we want to encourage authors to offer unique know-how to our users. 
Do premium layouts cost extra?

Premium layouts will be priced on top of the notebook base (which includes all free layouts). However users will pay only the first time they order any given premium layout as they are entitled to unlimited reprints of it. Indiegogo backers receive all premium layouts created before July 2016 for free.
What topics are suitable for layout contribution?

Whatever is close to you! Some contributors have created their way of taking notes for their field of work or interest. Others want to give hints what to log to others. In general any topic revolving around productivity, sports, food, culture, journaling or personal growth will be useful to the community.
Can I consult my layout idea before buying the perk?

Of course! Email us anytime at hello-at-trulymine.ink or send us a message through Indiegogo. We can call each other and we can talk about your idea. That way you can get a taste of how the Contributor sessions work.
Can I become a contributor after the IndieGoGo campaign is over? How will it work?

Yes. We will always be looking for new contributors. However, joining now has a big advantage - you get to be first to work on your topic and you can set the standard. We will always be gracious to the original backers and their content will be featured more prominently in our store.
Do I need special equipment to open the reclosable spine?

No, you can easily open the spine with your fingers. There is also a special trick to open it really fast, using a pen.
Will I receive my TrulyMine before Holidays?

In Mid-December you will receive a voucher code to enter our website so you or your firends can start crafting their notebook right after the christmas dinner. You can place order anytime, we will start shipping first orders beginning of January.",27.0,3,"1 Campaign

<p>It is a tremendous honor to be able to share my gifts in this way!  At present I work full time as a Computer Draftsman in Portland, Oregon.  A successful campaign will <b>""Open the Path""</b> to manifest a sustainable part-time business and serve as an opportunity for me to integrate my true passion, creative flow and love of craftsmanship in service of a global spiritual community.  </p>
<p>The name of this project is <b>""Espada De Luz"".</b>  This name was given in honor of Saint Michael with his <b>""Sword of Light""</b> and its connection to forces of healing and sacred geometry.    <br/></p>
<p>I currently have an extensive product line related to Santo Daime, a host of new ideas that have yet to be manifested and more orders than I can fill.  Having 
a laser cutter will allow me to cutout my designs as needed, thus maximizing creative potential and saving a tremendous amount of time, effort, and resources.    <span style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>        </span></p>

<h2>A Peek into the Process~!<br/>
</h2>
The technique I use to create ""Laser-Cut"" sacred artwork is by first developing and refining the design in a computer drafting software and then ""printing"" to laser cutting machine.  All of the products I make are cut from thin sheets of sustainable Birch Plywood.  Once the pieces are all cut, I gather them for sanding, staining, gluing and assembly by hand.<br/><br/>Some objects are made up of as many as 30 layers of thin plywood pieces stacked and glued together to create a radiant 3D effect.  The gluing and staining process is extremely tedious and time consuming, however very rewarding~!    <br/><br/><h4>Below are some pictures related to process:    </h4>

Wow, look at all those layers!                  Lots of care for safe shipping!  <br/><br/><h4>So how did I get into all of this...?</h4>In 2013, I began working at a design firm providing Computer Drafting Services for the operation of an in-house laser cutting table.  One evening, while in a spiritual ceremony, I began to envision myself using this incredible tool to make a Santo Daime Cruzeiro (Cross).  Soon after I sketched the first design in the computer and in <strong>February 2014,</strong> I made my very first laser-cut Santo Daime Cruzeiro!  <strong></strong> <br/><br/>In the last two 
years I have made <strong>20+ Cruzeiros</strong> for home altars 
and churches as well as other kinds of fun Santo Daime artwork including: star boxes, necklaces, wall hangings, refrigerator magnets, wood farda stars and more...    <br/><br/><h2>What is the Money going for...?</h2>
</div><div>
<div>Currently I pay a third party for all of my laser cutting thus I spend considerable time acquiring materials, delivering and picking up the cut pieces and it take several weeks to have my designs delivered.  Because of this every Cruzeiro is <b>""made to order""</b> making the whole process very difficult and time consuming.  With my current method of (outsourcing the laser cutting) it can take a month or longer to go thru the steps for just one order.  Most importantly, not having my own cutter makes it extremely difficult and time consuming to refine and develop new products and design ideas.<br/><br/>I have extensively researched different laser cutters, their capabilities, the quality and longevity of the cutting apparatus while taking into consideration usability, reliability, maintenance, and repair options.  Because of my professional experience operating a laser cutter, I feel confident I have selected a high quality machine that will meet my ongoing needs.   <br/><br/>Below is a picture of the laser cutter I will purchase with your support!  It is a terrific machine -<strong> Full Spectrum Laser Hobby Laser</strong> with a 45 Watt Laser Tube.  This product is assembled in the United States, competitively priced, and comes with ongoing technical and parts support.  The laser tube is rated from 3000 to 6000 hours and comes with a two year warranty.     <br/>

<br/><div>The majority of Santo Daime artwork I have made so far resides in the United States; however, I also have artwork in other countries including Mexico, New Zealand, England, Amsterdam and, of course, Brazil.  In 2015 I was able to send some of my artwork to Ceu do Mapia with dear friends who were traveling there.  Upon their arrival they donated a beautiful 2 foot tall Cruzeiro to the Santa Casa.  <br/><br/>
<p>Having a laser cutter will allow me to continue to 
develop the Santo Daime related products as well as 
create new ones indefinitely.  It will also open the door to new collaborative projects with others.           <strong><br/></strong></p>

<div> </div> <div> <h2>Risks &amp; Challenges~</h2>The biggest risk with this campaign is that I might not receive enough donations to actually buy the laser cutter once the campaign ends.  If this happens, I will begin saving the remainder of the money on my own and/or begin to peruse other ways to fund the campaign.  For this reason, the first <strong>$1000</strong> I raise will be dedicated to the purchasing of the raw materials and laser cutting services to ensure I am able deliver on my promise for Perks and Incentives even if I am unable to purchase the cutter right away.<br/><div>

</div></div>","What It's All About~Greetings Dear Ones,My name is Jeremiah.  For two years I have been making sacred artwork for a spiritual tradition from the Brazilian Amazon called Santo Daime.  The purpose of this campaign is to generate funds to acquire a laser cutting machine and supplies to take this project to the next level!  Also, I plan to collaborate with other artists, crafters, and thinkers to manifest new kinds of illuminated sacred objects and artwork for other spiritual traditions and ideologies.  
It is a tremendous honor to be able to share my gifts in this way!  At present I work full time as a Computer Draftsman in Portland, Oregon.  A successful campaign will ""Open the Path"" to manifest a sustainable part-time business and serve as an opportunity for me to integrate my true passion, creative flow and love of craftsmanship in service of a global spiritual community.  
The name of this project is ""Espada De Luz"".  This name was given in honor of Saint Michael with his ""Sword of Light"" and its connection to forces of healing and sacred geometry.    
I currently have an extensive product line related to Santo Daime, a host of new ideas that have yet to be manifested and more orders than I can fill.  Having 
a laser cutter will allow me to cutout my designs as needed, thus maximizing creative potential and saving a tremendous amount of time, effort, and resources.            
Below is a fun collage containing pictures of the sacred artwork I have made so far.  That's me in the middle!  For a comprehensive collection of pictures of the artwork I have made, click on the Gallery Tab.

A Peek into the Process~!

The technique I use to create ""Laser-Cut"" sacred artwork is by first developing and refining the design in a computer drafting software and then ""printing"" to laser cutting machine.  All of the products I make are cut from thin sheets of sustainable Birch Plywood.  Once the pieces are all cut, I gather them for sanding, staining, gluing and assembly by hand.Some objects are made up of as many as 30 layers of thin plywood pieces stacked and glued together to create a radiant 3D effect.  The gluing and staining process is extremely tedious and time consuming, however very rewarding~!    Below are some pictures related to process:    


Design as a 3D Computer Model.              Laser ""Cut-File"" - Thin Plywood Sheets.


 Laser machine cuts & etches my designs with perfect precision!






The pieces get glued together.    Yes, lots of sanding little star shapes!


Wow, look at all those layers!                  Lots of care for safe shipping!  So how did I get into all of this...?In 2013, I began working at a design firm providing Computer Drafting Services for the operation of an in-house laser cutting table.  One evening, while in a spiritual ceremony, I began to envision myself using this incredible tool to make a Santo Daime Cruzeiro (Cross).  Soon after I sketched the first design in the computer and in February 2014, I made my very first laser-cut Santo Daime Cruzeiro!   In the last two 
years I have made 20+ Cruzeiros for home altars 
and churches as well as other kinds of fun Santo Daime artwork including: star boxes, necklaces, wall hangings, refrigerator magnets, wood farda stars and more...    What is the Money going for...?

Currently I pay a third party for all of my laser cutting thus I spend considerable time acquiring materials, delivering and picking up the cut pieces and it take several weeks to have my designs delivered.  Because of this every Cruzeiro is ""made to order"" making the whole process very difficult and time consuming.  With my current method of (outsourcing the laser cutting) it can take a month or longer to go thru the steps for just one order.  Most importantly, not having my own cutter makes it extremely difficult and time consuming to refine and develop new products and design ideas.I have extensively researched different laser cutters, their capabilities, the quality and longevity of the cutting apparatus while taking into consideration usability, reliability, maintenance, and repair options.  Because of my professional experience operating a laser cutter, I feel confident I have selected a high quality machine that will meet my ongoing needs.   Below is a picture of the laser cutter I will purchase with your support!  It is a terrific machine - Full Spectrum Laser Hobby Laser with a 45 Watt Laser Tube.  This product is assembled in the United States, competitively priced, and comes with ongoing technical and parts support.  The laser tube is rated from 3000 to 6000 hours and comes with a two year warranty.     



The cost for this machine is $4,999 dollars.  My total campaign budget for 
this project is $7,000 which includes the laser cutter, three 
months worth of startup materials, electricity, shop space, Oregon Business License and Indiegogo's fees.
Below is my formal Startup Budget:


~ Startup Budget ~Equipment and supplies:

Hobby Series - Full Spectrum laser w/45 watt tube & 2 year warranty - $4,999


Freight with insurance - $125

Shop space rental - $250 per month x 3 months = $750

Electricity for shop - $50 per month x 3 months = $150

4x8 sheet of plywood stock = $250

Sand paper, glue, wood stain, hand tools = $100

Work Bench & Lights = $100

Oregon business license - Application and Fees = $200


Subtotal - $6,675

Indiegogo charges a 5% hosting fee x $6,675 = $325


Total - $7,000

Fun Perks & Incentives~!Your pledge puts me one step closer to realizing this 
dream!  Everybody who contributes will receive a signed Thank You Card along with my sincere appreciation and gratitude.  Additionally, I have selected fun Perks from my current line of products in a variety of price ranges.  Below are pictures of each of the perks that are available as part of this campaign :-)  If you require shipping outside of the United States, I will contact you via email, additional international shipping costs will apply.

Pictured below is a 2 foot tall ""Sete Estrelas"" Cruzeiro at it's very first work :-)    


The perks are a promise!  After this campaign closes it will take me some time to get the laser cutter purchased and fully operational.  Once that happens I will begin to fulfill my promise to make and ship out all of the perks right away!  Unfortunately there is no way for me to predict the number of pledges.  That said, after careful consideration, I am prepared to make the number
 of perks and incentives necessary to satisfy a fully funded campaign no
 matter how long it takes and I will do my best to produce in a timely manner.  You will receive an email update monthly of the status of your perk until it has been delivered.  For more details regarding Perks, see Risks and Challenges section at the bottom of this page.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
Hi!  We're Fab Lab Carolinas, and we help ordinary people make extraordinary things.  Based in our beloved Durham, North Carolina, we are a team of 4 individuals and dozens of volunteers with backgrounds in technology, design or just DIY making for fun. We are part of a global network of over 100 Fab Lab sites throughout the world, and we are trying to build a Fab Lab here in North Carolina. Our mission is to foster innovation, education and invention through community access to high-end digital fabrication tools that can construct almost anything. This campaign will raise money to get our IDEA bus (short for Innovation, Design, Entrepreneurship and Action) loaded with those tools and equipment and take it on the road to meet the needs of under-resourced communities throughout North Carolina.<br/><br/>

We need to raise $20,000 to cover the cost of purchasing a ShopBot digital CNC mill, an oscilloscope, rent to cover 6 months at our headquarters in downtown Durham, and gas for our bus for one full season. There are so many people with ideas that will benefit from this opportunity to empower themselves to start a business, get a job,or build a portfolio to pursue college or vocational training.  So we're turning to our strongest supporters to ask for contributions. In exchange, we're offering rad stickers, a t-shirt, and even a CNC Mantis and a fully built 3D printer!<br/><br/>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
Our plan, already in action in our central location in Durham, is to use the IDEA Bus to establish Fab Lab ""IDEA Hubs” right where folks interact everyday.  IDEA Hubs are small community think tanks composed of average folks seeking different types of empowerment.  A Fab Lab IDEA member may take classes to learn how to use our equipment for whatever goal they wish to achieve; some may seek to gain manufacturing skills to secure employment, others may use our tools to develop a product for a business, or perhaps they just come by to make something for the pure creative joy of improving their quality of life.  We know this IDEA Bus can make a difference to many, but we need your help to make it happen.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Your contribution will help us take our bus on the road to all parts of North Carolina to serve people who live in the most under-resourced areas with the greatest needs.  Thanks!<br/><br/><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong>

Hi!  We're Fab Lab Carolinas, and we help ordinary people make extraordinary things.  Based in our beloved Durham, North Carolina, we are a team of 4 individuals and dozens of volunteers with backgrounds in technology, design or just DIY making for fun. We are part of a global network of over 100 Fab Lab sites throughout the world, and we are trying to build a Fab Lab here in North Carolina. Our mission is to foster innovation, education and invention through community access to high-end digital fabrication tools that can construct almost anything. This campaign will raise money to get our IDEA bus (short for Innovation, Design, Entrepreneurship and Action) loaded with those tools and equipment and take it on the road to meet the needs of under-resourced communities throughout North Carolina.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Mind The Art Entertainment, a New York City based collaborative arts and entertainment company whose mission is to promote, enhance, workshop, and produce new work and talent in the arts has had an amazing four years... but now we really need your help!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>Mind The Art has produced over 35 multi arts projects. We've had the support of thousands of fans and hundreds of artists but times are hard right now and this year has thrown us some interesting curve balls. Over the years we have showcased new work and given new artists a real voice. We've never asked for help but 64 theaters have gone bankrupt in NYC in the last year and we refuse to join that list, so please give us a hand and have the time of your life!</p>
<p></p>
<p><br/></p>
<h6><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal;""><h3 style="""">We will prevail but we need your help!</h3></span></h6>
<p>On April 29th we are throwing a party for ALL artists to come and hang out at the bankrupting theater Center Stage NY, 48 west 21st st, 4th Floor. The event is FREE but we are asking for any donations for the drinks and for entrance. If you have some money to help us stay afloat please share it, if not then come anyway and party with other artists and woo the money people :-)</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We have a goal to raise $3,000 between this night and this Indie GoGo campaign by May 31st so help us reach our goal to stay afloat! <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>This event will have wine, beer and a ""starving artist"" cocktail. It will also be more fun than you can imagine.<br/></p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>If we can raise this money then we can continue to support our current projects as they move from development to launch over the next year. It allows us to pay back some debt from problems bankrupting theaters have caused us this year and allows us the chance to continue with our mission to support artists and their work while supporting them. </p>

<h2 align=""center"">SPECIAL TRIBUTE ISSUE</h2>
<h2 align=""center"">DEDICATED TO NEWTOWN, CT</h2>
<div class=""full-description"">
<p><strong><em>THE NEWTOWNER</em></strong><strong>  </strong>is a one-of-a-kind arts and literary magazine that showcases the work of emerging and established literary, visual, and performing artists from our local area and across the nation.</p>
<p><em>THE NEWTOWNER</em> derives its name from Newtown, CT where we are based and from its residents who make this town so special.</p>
<p><strong><span>Our mission</span> </strong>is to celebrate <strong>creative community</strong> and the <strong>life-affirming power</strong> of literature and the arts.</p>
<p>In light of the events of 12/14/12, this mission has never been more relevant and important.</p>
<p><strong>Our upcoming issue</strong>, due for release in June 2013, will be a special tribute issue offered as a healing gift to the town of Newtown. By its very nature it will be a publication of historic significance.</p>

<strong>Did you know that:</strong> </h3>
<ul>
<li>Over the last two years we have published six acclaimed issues.</li>
<li>We are one of very few arts and literary magazines that operates as a grass roots, all-volunteer movement in a local community, and that is not funded by a university or college.</li>
<li>We are the only arts and literary journal we know of aimed at a general readership that regularly publishes the creative work of young writers and artists. We publish the work of elementary, middle-school, and high-school students in a dedicated section called ""Youth Expressions.""</li>
<li>Not only do we publish the work of young writers and artists, we mentor youth editors who select and edit the works published in the Youth Expressions section.</li>
<li>We work with and publish the creative work of Garner Correctional Institution inmates. We are the only arts and literary journal we know of that is doing this on a regular basis. This work is showcased in its own dedicated section called ""From the Inside Out.""</li>
<li>In the digital age, <em>The Newtowner</em> is an ode to print as an art form. It is a perfect bound, full-color art magazine printed on 100# weight silk-textured paper with exceptional graphic design. </li>
</ul>

SPECIAL TRIBUTE ISSUE
DEDICATED TO NEWTOWN, CT

THE NEWTOWNER  is a one-of-a-kind arts and literary magazine that showcases the work of emerging and established literary, visual, and performing artists from our local area and across the nation.
THE NEWTOWNER derives its name from Newtown, CT where we are based and from its residents who make this town so special.
Our mission is to celebrate creative community and the life-affirming power of literature and the arts.
In light of the events of 12/14/12, this mission has never been more relevant and important.
Our upcoming issue, due for release in June 2013, will be a special tribute issue offered as a healing gift to the town of Newtown. By its very nature it will be a publication of historic significance.
Our aims for this issue are to:

Celebrate the people, beauty, culture, and community spirit of Newtown, CT
Commemorate the fallen
Recognize and give artistic expression to the grief we have experienced
Highlight the role of the arts in healing and the arts’ ability to nurture our humanity
Focus on our love, faith, and hope for the future

Features in this issue will include:

Keynote message by Newtown’s First Selectwoman Pat Llodra
Faces of Newtown – portraits of Newtown residents
Places of Newtown – a photo essay highlighting Newtown’s physical beauty
Letters to the People of Newtown – messages of hope, support, and inspiration from writers such as Wally Lamb, Lois Lowry, and Katherine Paterson, clergy such as Rabbi Praver of Congregation Adath Israel, educators such as Chip Dumais, Principal of Newtown High School, and leaders such as Senator Richard Blumenthal.
Reflections on “What Newtown Means to Me” by local residents
Essays by David Wheeler and Sophfronia Scott, Sandy Hook Elementary School parents
Poetry by Pulitzer Prize-winning poet Yusef Komunyakaa
Poetry by Sandy Hook Elementary School staff member Cindy Carlson and Newtown High School students
From Broadway with Love by Alan Muraoka from Sesame Street  

Call for sponsorship: Our hearts' desire is to provide complimentary copies to, if not every Newtown household, at least every Sandy Hook Elementary School family. We are looking for individual and corporate sponsor funding to be able to achieve this goal. Please contact editor@thenewtownermagazine.com to express your interest.
Call for submissions: The Newtowner is calling for submissions of poetry, nonfiction, photography, and art that would be appropriate in an issue dedicated to the people and places of Newtown. All submissions must be submitted via the Submissions page on The Newtowner website: www.thenewtownermagazine.com. Deadline for all submissions is May 15, 2013.
Call for volunteers: The Newtowner  is seeking volunteers and interns that would be interested in helping to produce this special tribute issue. Volunteer opportunities are available in the areas of writing, editing, public relations, publicity, fundraising, photography, illustration, design, and distribution. Please contact editor@thenewtownermagazine.com to express your interest.


Did you know that: 

Over the last two years we have published six acclaimed issues.
We are one of very few arts and literary magazines that operates as a grass roots, all-volunteer movement in a local community, and that is not funded by a university or college.
We are the only arts and literary journal we know of aimed at a general readership that regularly publishes the creative work of young writers and artists. We publish the work of elementary, middle-school, and high-school students in a dedicated section called ""Youth Expressions.""
Not only do we publish the work of young writers and artists, we mentor youth editors who select and edit the works published in the Youth Expressions section.
We work with and publish the creative work of Garner Correctional Institution inmates. We are the only arts and literary journal we know of that is doing this on a regular basis. This work is showcased in its own dedicated section called ""From the Inside Out.""
In the digital age, The Newtowner is an ode to print as an art form. It is a perfect bound, full-color art magazine printed on 100# weight silk-textured paper with exceptional graphic design. 

 

More than a magazine, THE NEWTOWNER is a community
More than a magazine, The Newtowner  is a community of readers, writers, editors, artists, and art lovers, who together support the arts and each other. 
The Newtowner' s community outreach has included:

Creation of the Inaugural Newtowner Open Poetry Award
Creation of The Newtowner/Newtown High School Poetry Award
Mentoring of high school and middle school youth editors 
Musical and dramatic performances
Dance workshops 
Panel discussions
Newtown Arts Festival support and involvement
Local library events
Attendance at readings and performances by inmates at Garner Correctional Institution by the staff of The Newtowner

The image was a before-and-after picture of my transformative planetary artwork, juxtaposing the bulb-like top of an old fire hydrant with the artwork that I made from it. To my utter surprise and excitement, within an hour or so it had risen to the very top of the Front Page of the site where it remained for the duration of the day, accumulating some 1.5 million views and roughly 50,000 up-votes (or 'likes'). While reading through all of the comments I couldn't help but think, ""What's next? Where do I go from here?"". Well, I've been featured in several blogs and news outlets like Petapixel and Wired.

The Process
Finding rusty fire hydrants that are suitable for terraforming is not a walk in the park (unless it is). Over the coming weeks and months I will continue to scour the city of San Francisco for its elusive rusty fire hydrants, and transform them into worlds, continuing to develop my style and sharing the whole process. I want to produce a large quantity of them so that I can distribute them everywhere later this year, which means I'll have to print a whole lot all at once.
The 2014 calendar will include only the best of the best rusty fire hydrant images, steering your year into a realm of curiosity and wonderment. You'll look forward to the end of the month, every month (except December). As well as designing a calendar, I will produce a variety of posters, and also offer an insanely awesome t-shirt. (No text or nothin, just pure graphical goodness.)

Some planets will have vibrant forests and dusty valleys, others frozen over with glaciers and bacteria-rich oceans, some atmospheric with thick clouds, others void of life altogether. Some may even have civilizations illuminating the dark side of the planet.
The Rewards
I have physical and digital rewards to offer, from posters to the printed calendar to T-Shirts of all different sizes, and limited edition prints. The content and diversity of the planets to come are affected profoundly by your feedback, and the more funding I recieve, the more options you will have to choose from for your posters, and possibly even for T-Shirts. I will inflate the scope of the calendar's design based on the success of the campaign. All supporters get to have their name and rank on the website (this is optional).
I'm offering an opportunity for higher-level backers to have a planet (or even a solar system) produced just for you, based on your specifications! A poster of two planets colliding? A planet with a moon that also has its own moon? A gas planet with a rocky core and icy rings? BRING IT ON! Check out all that I have to offer in the rewards section to the right. Even if you are donating just a dollar, you are helping me share my passion with the world.

The Dream
I would love to sell my work at conventions, book stores, art shows and more. I hope to produce a hard-bound book showcasing my entire collection, which also delves into the methodology and philosophy behind the imagery that I create. I hope that this niche, peculiar artform leads to bigger and better things, and that I will be able to continue to share my message that art is transformation: it is the process of turning something mundane into something beautiful and captivating.

2015-09-08 17:26 Ritzeh: there was this one guy that drew a pippi that was kinda inappropriate for the contest
2015-09-08 17:26 Ritzeh: midge and i were like
2015-09-08 17:26 Ritzeh: ey man lets get that guy to draw pippi hentai lol 
2015-09-08 17:27 Ritzeh: he didnt do it 

2015-09-08 17:27 Ritzeh: so we were like ok 

2015-09-08 17:27 Ritzeh: then forgot until now 
2015-09-08 17:27 Ritzeh: where someone in my ts was like 
2015-09-08 17:27 Ritzeh: did you know that there is hentai of pippi by daru 
2015-09-08 17:27 Ritzeh: then i got linked that picture i sent to you 
2015-09-08 17:27 Ritzeh: but you said it wasnt exactly by you 
2015-09-08 17:27 Ritzeh: so uh ye 

2015-09-08 17:27 Ritzeh: :I

ok, so BASICALLY, daru is the official osu artist, and he takes commissions, including nsfw stuff. we are hrony males in need of some decent rule34, so we proposed to him that we'll somehow raise enough money to pay for the commission. we straight up asked and he said yes. this is not a meme, i'm dead fucking serious.



his commission prices are $200 for a standard full color picture, and $500 for what we're aiming for, a doujin page.


tl;dr: if we raise $500, daru will draw pippi hentai

you can find examples of daru's art here on his devart.

Our new artist is Sylphia. Look above for the info.

<div>Outdoor Vision Fest® (OVF) takes place at Santa Fe University of Art and Design and is a free, annual public event featuring environmental projections and outdoor art installations of design, animation, full motion video, video mapping, motion graphics and interactive multimedia. Using the university’s stunning architecture as a canvas, this event features student artwork created through light in dozens of projections and exhibitions. A self-guided experience, OVF presents a unique opportunity for visitors to see large-scale art installations of design, animation, photography and other motion imagery projected on the walls of Ricardo Legorreta’s world-famous Visual Arts Center, the Fogelson Library, and Garson Theatre.<br/>

<div>OVF has been nominated twice for Best of Santa Fe in 2015 and 2016. </div>
<h3>Pandora's Story</h3> <p>Pandora's Dream takes inspiration from the Greek mythology story of Pandoras Box. </p>
<p>In the story, Pandora is given a box by Zeus and is told to not open the box under any circumstances. Pandora's curiosity gets the better of her and she opens the box releasing these horrible bugs that represent disease, hate, poverty, misery and sadness out into the world. The last bug that comes out of the box is a beautiful dragonfly named Hope. </p>
<p></p>
<p>As a child we tend to have overactive imaginations and we come up with the most bizarre things and ideas, sometimes these thoughts bleed into reality and other times our imagination seems to get the better of us. </p>
<p>For this art piece, we took elements from Pandoras Box and revamped it, Pandoras Box is now a child's bedroom, Pandoras curiosity is manifested into this child, and the contents of that box is now all around you in this interactive dream space- some bad, some good, and some in-between reality and imagination. </p>

<p><strong>Thus, 'BIG NOTHING/ Das Projekt zum ALLEM im NICHTS' as an evolving Conscious Art work is about YOU audaciously investing in such gap and rejoicing its intrinsic love and beauty - it's about YOU investing in NOTHING - for to experience big magnetic magic fading in.' <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1478785330/ypbpkb88idse1hzfqtdu.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></strong><br/>*************************************************************</p>

<p><strong>Latest UPDATE - BIG NOTHING's 3rd round on Indiegogo:</strong></p>
<p><i>Since BIG NOTHING's very birth as a Crowd- and Contentfunding project on Indiegogo on March 8th 2016, more and more people have felt inspired to test the magic-magnetic quality of NOTHINGNESS by audaciously investing time and money into NOTHING. Some invested into sheer NOTHINGNESS, others booked a coaching/ healing session on the matter or even engaged in the NOTHINGNESS Process. Again others undertook, inspired and guided by BIG NOTHING, a 'magic-magnetic trip' into the mystery of </i><i>NOTHINGNESS' here on the NOTHNGNESS island Ikaria in the Aegaen Sea (s. article from Gabriele Maria Sigg in Tattva Viveka), whereas again others felt simply attracted by the cutting edge nature of BIG NOTHING as an evolving conscious art project in which everyone investing into NOTHINGNESS by 'cosmic law' becomes a magic-magnetic part of the work... And there were again others who just felt happy to contribute to my research on NOTHINGNESS and the Feminine-Somatic Principle here on the island -  which is very likely to be informing a later book, an installation and in a longer run a film... </i></p>
<p><i>So far, around 5700 $ have been raised and invested into BIG NOTHING and my exciting work on the matter by first courageious NOTHINGNESS-pioneers. Now with this 3rd Crowd- and Contentfunding let's go far beyond - let's make BIG NOTHING a financial and thus political statement. Let it be millions for NOTHINGNESS (instead of war!) - and thus millions for sheer magnetic beauty, vitality and love which through BIG NOTHING (NOTHINGNESS) manifest once we let go of our fears.</i></p>
<p><i>Become the president and lover you'd wish to see in the world. Make healing possible - by stepping and investing into NOTHING as the feminine-somatic way to BE.</i></p>
<p><strong><i>Let's start now! Let's create a wave - revealing and setting off the 'Magic magnetic EVERYTHING' hidden in the apparently blunt NOTHING.</i></strong></p>

<p>Project description in English</p>
<h2>1. Welcome to BIG NOTHING!</h2>
<p>Have you ever spent money for NOTHING? ...</p>
<p>If so, this project is YOUR chance (and maybe our shared blessing) if you charmingly do it again!</p>
<p>However, this time, you are invited to invest in NOTHING in your right mind and with your fullest awareness – so that you are open enough to RECEIVE the fullest of the hidden riches ‘NOTHINGNESS’ has on offer – for your heart, your soul, your health, your life - when ‘giving’! :)</p>
<p>With the support of this project, you are given the unique opportunity and platform, to experiment with the nature of NOTHINGNESS by consciously investing in NOTHING, i.e. in the ‘Non-Space’, in ‘The Big Void’, in ‘the gap’, in ‘the silence’…  – and as such to make an entirely new experience with what we usually are trying to avoid: the confrontation with NOTHING...</p>
<p>Maybe investing in NOTHING or being confronted with NOTHING sometimes feels a bit like facing death? At least, ‘Big Void’ does ask for courage, sometimes even for audacity – and definitely for the relaxation of ‘logic brain’. And many people shy away from BIG NOTHING and ‘hide’ in what they call ‘real’. I would say, within our ‘logic brain’ and profit-oriented culture it is definitely an act of subversion to dare and face BIG NOTHING – let alone to invest in it! :)</p>
<p>So welcome to both - the subversive and the loving side in you! Get your 'guts' together - and dare to spend your money here - on NOTHING!</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>2. About BIG NOTHING</h2>
<p>The BIG NOTHING project seeks from its very start to stimulate in a very playful and experimental way the idea and insight in you that NOTHING - or NOTHINGNESS - is never nothing. On the contrary. BIG NOTHING is always full. Full of sheer abundance, options, love and joy - ready to materialise, as long as you remain open and courageous enough to keep engaged with those hidden riches and creative powers such ‘silent unknown’ has on offer. To invest in BIG NOTHING could mean that you might experience NOTHING at first, but maybe loads in a longer run. It may also mean that you are asked to transform your time-based/ logic brain mentality into a more ‘magnetic’ one…  And here’s the point where meditation or my DACA technique and NOTHINGNESS Process Coaching may be of help... (s. Perks to your right)</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>3. Purpose &amp; Experience</h2>
<p>The feeling of happiness, bliss and love that you might experience when investing your money here and now in NOTHING – while expecting NOTHING - is the magic power of NOTHINGNESS and thus not only the project’s research topic, but also its highest goal and nature. The miracles or synchronicities you might eventually start to experience when consciously spending money on our shared BIGmagneticNOTHING belong to the realm of what I call ‘magnetic power’ or ‘somatic-feminine quality’ which I view as the counterpart to the ‘analytical-masculine quality’ or ‘logic brain’.</p>
<p>If you would like to find out more about my research in the ‘somatic-feminine’, you are very welcome to visit my new blog <a href=""https://bloggingfeminine.wordpress.com/blogging-feminine"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://bloggingfeminine.wordpress.com/blogging...</a> or my artwork in film and theatre (s. info below) or you join me in a healing/ coaching session, Meditation or Yoga class (s. Perks and Meditation/ Yoga classes updates on FB &amp; <a href=""http://www.potentialcoaching.de"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.potentialcoaching.de</a>). :)</p>
<p>There is also my article on the Feminine Principle and its terminology coming out in Tattva Viveka on November 15th 2016.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>4. BIG NOTHING's very nature</h2>
<p>Now: the more people we are here, on this very platform, who are brave enough to subversively invest big and small sums of money in NOTHING - and who make a NOTHINGNESS experience at the same time, the more abundant and powerful the BIG NOTHING project’s result will be in the end! And watch the traces life embraces – when you let BIG NOTHING ‘speak’. ;)</p>
<p>The more people supporting this project, the bigger and more ground-breaking the BIG NOTHING’s output and effect as an art project and ‘life-transformer’ will be. That’s the very nature of this project. NOTHING more.</p>
<p>Maybe there will be (amongst many other things) a finished film coming out of BIG NOTHING, or a book, or a healing art installation reflecting on my and your NOTHINGNESS experiences. Or maybe you’ll meet your NOTHINGNESS on my personal BIG NOTHING island and research place Ikaria. Whichever. The biggest reward when investing in NOTHING is the experience of NOTHINGNESS in itself – the experience of its ‘talking’, of its wisdom, its creative powers, which are being unlocked in the moment you dare to know NOTHING, to expect NOTHING, to plan NOTHING. In such moments you are free – you feel expanded. You may even feel love. Maybe this project allows you to flow with such momentum and experience of freedom and expansion a tiny little bit longer, letting you taste its smell. At least that’s what I experienced after I had to face BIG NOTHING for months due to a stage accident… And in bringing now the fruits of such experience into the world and to you personally, fills me up with a very deep happiness and joy.</p>
<p>I thank you so much for joining in – and play the ‘game’ with me! :)</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>5. About the Perks</h2>
<p>If you look at the NOTHINGNESS Perks to your right, you’ll find out what kind of investment suits you best to make BIG NOTHING work – for yourself and as a collective experience. And from the very moment you make your investment, this project starts to blossom. That’s the beauty of it. It exists as soon as YOU start it. Please make it big! And please, spread the words! BE the proof that BIG NOTHING is not nothing, but EVERTHING beyond love!</p>
<p>When choosing your Perk (i.e. your investing amount and your specific version of playing the BIG NOTHING ‘game’/experiment), you have the choice to either make an investment into ‘plain NOTHINGNESS’ or to invest in a guided version within the BIG NOTHING experience.</p>
<p>Whichever you choose, I’m so happy and grateful that you join this subversive experiment and game, which hopefully brings up lots of magic and abundant personal and collective experience – and helps many of you to grow - i.e. finding back their love, bliss and joy. And please do not use too much ‘logic brain’ when you read this and start acting along this suggested scheme! ;)</p>
<p>Thank you so much for your courage, audacity, love &amp; support. You ARE amazing!</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>6. THE BIG NOTHING's Summery</h2>
<p>The BIGmagneticNOTHING….</p>
<p>… is an art project encouraging its investors and audience to enter a shared experience with NOTHINGNESS and opening up for individual &amp; experience-based proof that NOTHING is never NOTHING, but EVERYTHING beyond love – in the moment when we allow ourselves to shift focus from ‘logic’ brain to ‘somatic’ brain.</p>
<p>… is – at its very beginning - an art project in which the project investors are at the same time the project's receivers/ audience.</p>
<p>… is an art project which comes to life as soon as its investors and receivers start investing money in BIG NOTHING.</p>
<p>… is an art project which scale and extent is dependent on its investors/ audience degree of subversiveness and ‘appetite’ to spend money for/ in NOTHING.</p>
<p>… is a process-oriented experiment with the ‘Non-Space’ (the ‘Big Void’) which has no concrete intent regarding its final outcome. There might be a film, a book or live Performance Acts arising out of the project and the experience with BIG NOTHING. However, the projects emphasis does not lay on a previously defined final product, but on the process itself, the shared experience and the questions it triggers.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>7. How BIG NOTHING came to birth...</h2>
<p>A stage accident on August 21st 2014 injured not only my head, but also my day-to-day functioning and identity up to that very day. From one moment to the next, I hit bottom and I was forced to keep completely still. It kind of felt like an ‘order of life’, so to speak. I could do NOTHING about it. I could do NOTHING for it, nor against it. It didn’t help when I moaned, it didn’t help when I planned nor when I made some prognoses about the speed of my healing. All I had to learn from that moment onwards was to dare facing NOTHING and rejoicing its stillness – and eventually its magic.</p>
<p>As an actress (director and coach) I had also been working self-employed. And for the performance on that very night I was not insured - as it turned out along the unfolding of the accident’s repercussions... Thus, to me in this very situation, hitting bottom and facing NOTHING did not only mean stopping the ‘Doing’, but also stopping earning money by means of ‘Doing’. And that to me felt at first really scary...</p>
<p>For a long time it looked like I was losing everything. No longer being able to resolve my situation by acts of ‘Doing’ was something I felt very foreign to and which thus created so much fear in the beginning of such NOTHINGNESS 'process'. Bound to the sickbed, I felt there was NOTHING I could actively do to save myself. However, there I still was - and there I still am. And in such experience of BIG NOTHING, I came to taste the fruits of surrender, the fruits of BEING as a HUMAN BEING - in moments we manage to rid ourselves of the fear we picked up on and internalized through social conditioning and past traumatic experience...</p>
<p>I now know that NOTHING is never NOTHING, but EVERYTHING you are asking for.</p>
<p>And it’s been so much I gained since I learnt to let BIG NOTHING do the ‘work’.</p>
<p>I had been a Meditation and Yoga practitioner for over 20 years before the accident, but it was only some months after the accident when I started to access and receive the NOTHINGNESS’ fullest bliss.</p>
<p>From the moment I embraced the fact that there was NOTHING I could do other than to surrender, the situation (at least inside myself) turned round and I started hitting heights. All the sudden – and more and more often – I felt at complete ease with the situation I was in, despite the physical pain and the subsequent emotional condition and turbulence that still kept occurring. All the sudden a feeling of deep happiness and abundance that was no longer related to the concrete circumstances of my sickbed situation entered my life. And such experience was quite something.</p>
<p>Because, it made me understand that NOTHING is not NOTHING, but EVERYTHING embracing love, joy, opportunities and happiness – if we do dare to enter a dialogue with the ‘BIG VOID’.</p>
<p>This experience changed my life for ever and let me understand the nature of healing and ‘magnetic power’ to a greater depth. And this is how BIG NOTHING as evolving Conscious ART work is born. It grows with YOU and ME. And our connection in the 'BE!'.</p> <h2>8. More about the artist</h2>

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1478784477/kih6egevk1hxncyb3doi.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Die Neuigkeiten zum Projekt:</strong></p>
<p>BIG NOTHING/ Das Projekt zum Allem im NICHTS' in seiner derzeitigen Entwicklungsphase, wie als späteres Buch-/ Filmprojekt, möchte einen erfahrbaren Raum schaffen, in dem die Fülle von NICHTS-Momenten und deren Magie vom Rezipienten als (heilsame) Realität wahrgenommen und das Leben in dieser Fülle und Liebe damit erlernt werden kann.</p>
<p>Am 8.März 2016 ging BIG NOTHING als 'Das Grosse NICHTS Projekt' auf Indiegogo das erste Mal 60 Tage lang online, im Sommer als 'Das Projekt zur Fülle im NICHTS' zum zweiten Mal. Durch erste mutige Ins-NICHTS-Hineinschenkende kamen bisher ca. 5'700 $ magische NICHTS-Investitionen zusammen. Und mit dieser 3. Runde soll 'BIG NOTHING/ Das Projekt zum Allem im NICHTS' nun ganz offiziell in Richtung 'Start' rücken. Eine eigene Projekt-Webseite wird diesen konkreten Startschuss letztlich dann markieren.  So die konkrete Vorstellung. Doch vielleicht started das Projekt schon vorher durch? ;)</p>
<p>Also bitte macht BIG NOTHING jetzt schon 'really biiggg'! :) Nutzt gern auch die Coaching Perks zu Eurer rechten Seite - um Euch der Magie im NICHTS (und des Weiblichen Prinzips) durch eine geführte Meditation, eine Mindfulness oder Healing Session - oder durch einen NOTHINGNESS Prozess oder eine Reise ins NICHTS Ikarias (s. Artikel v. Gabriele Sigg in der Tattva Viveka) vertraut zu machen.  Aus der Fülle-Erfahrung jedes/ jeder einzelnen Schenkenden heraus kann BIG NOTHING als Conscious Art Werk immer weiterwachsen - bis die subjektive und kollektive Erfahrung mit dem NICHTS letztlich das konkrete KUNSTWERK wird. Mache Du diese bezaubernde magische Welle möglich! Investiere jetzt ganz kühn ins JETZT! Und das Buch zum NICHTS, die Installation und der Film dazu werden folgen.</p>

<p>Projektbeschreibung auf Deutsch:</p>
<h3>1. Die Fülle im NICHTS: Projektbeschreibung</h3>
<p><strong>1.1. Das NICHTS &amp; die FÜLLE</strong></p>
<p>Einmal mehr für ‚Nichts‘ Geld ausgeben!  Das ist das Projekt. Nur dieses eine Mal ganz bewusst - und dabei FÜLLE erleben! Wie geht denn das?! :)</p>
<p>Mit der Unterstützung dieses Projekts bekommst Du die Möglichkeit und Plattform geschenkt, eine neue Erfahrung/ ein Experiment mit dem NICHTS zu machen.</p>
<p>Das Projekt dient - schon im Prozess seiner Entstehung - als Spielfläche der Erkenntnis, dass das NICHTS nie nichts ist, sondern immer auch ein Vakuum schierer Fülle und Liebe beinhaltet - also letztendlich reines 'Lebenselixier' ist ... solange Du Dich auf diese Qualität, d.h. die im NICHTS geborgene Schaffens- und Kreativkraft einlässt und Du 'subversiv' genug bist, einmal für länger NICHTS zu erleben und/ oder Dein Geld einfach einmal bewusst ins NICHTS zu investieren. Kommt dann wirklich NICHTS zurück?</p>
<p>Deine Erfahrung mit dem NICHTS ist Inhalt des Projekts!</p>
<p><strong>1.2. Das NICHTS/ Die 'Nicht-Heit' als Momentum</strong></p>
<p>In diesem Projekt, welches das NICHTS zum Thema macht, steht die im NICHTS (oder in der 'Lücke') erlebbare FÜLLE im Zentrum. Das Glücksgefühl, welches Du (von mir begleitet oder nicht) durch Deine Investition ins NICHTS (s. Perks rechts) womöglich erleben wirst, ist der höchste Sinn dieses Projekts - welches sich ferner auch mit der im NICHTS verankerten 'weiblich-somatischen'/ 'magnetischen' Kreativkraft (als Gegenpol zur 'männlich-analytischen' Kreativkraft) auseinandersetzt. Ein Themenkreis, welcher mich seit meinem Bühnenunfall am 21. August 2014 künstlerisch intensiver beschäftigt (s. auch <a href=""https://bloggingfeminine.wordpress.com/blogging-feminine"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://bloggingfeminine.wordpress.com/blogging...</a>)  - und aus welchem vielleicht einmal ein Film entsteht und/ oder ein Buch.</p>
<p>Je mehr Menschen JETZT für dieses Projekt mit grossen und mit kleinen Summen ganz subversiv ins NICHTS investieren - desto kraftvoller wird die damit erzeugte Fülle sein. Und nach und nach wird diese Fülle auch äusserlich sicht- und erlebbar werden. In Deinem Leben wie in meinem. Wenn wir uns dafür öffnen. Lasst uns also diesen Moment gemeinsam kreieren! :)</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>1.3. Deine persönliche Erfahrung mit dem NICHTS als Teil des Gesamtwerks</strong></p>
<p>Kommt eine grosse, mutige Masse an NICHTS Investititionen hier bei diesem Crowdfunding (und hoffentlich bald auch auf einer eigenen Webseite) zusammen, steht am Ende tatsächlich auch ein künstlerisches Werk. Doch dieses Werk, bzw. ein im Vorfeld anvisiertes und definiertes Endprodukt, ist nicht das erste Ziel dieses Projekts. Das Ziel ist Eure/ Deine individuelle (und damit auch kollektive) Erfahrung mit dem NICHTS und das Erleben, dass das eigentlich Gewinnbringende am Investieren ins NICHTS das NICHTS selber ist - die Erfahrung seiner Schöpfungs-Potenz. Und diese Schöpfungspotenz und Kreativkraft erschliesst sich erst über unseren aller Mut, NICHTS zu wissen, NICHTS zu erwarten, NICHTS zu planen, wenn wir ins NICHTS investieren. Im NICHTS begegnen wir dem SELBST. Und nur wenn wir das NICHTS wirklich an uns heran lassen und es aushalten, kann es seine Kraft und Liebe erschliessen und ein Tor sein zu unserem persönlichen Glück. Und dieses Glück, das durch Deine/ Eure Investition ins NICHTS entsteht, wünsche ich Dir und Euch von Herzen.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>2. Die Perks</strong></h2>
<p>Eure Investition - Euer Vertrauen ins NICHTS!</p>
<p>Schaut gerne bei den Perks (rechts aussen), wie Ihr das NICHTS mit mir zusammen in Schwingung bringen könnt. Von dem Moment an, an dem Ihr hier mutig und mit Spiellust ins NICHTS investiert, fängt dieses Projekt an zu erblühen. Und jeder Betrag, jede einzelne Erfahrung von und mit Euch wird ein Beitrag dieser aus dem NICHTS entspringenden und kollektiv erlebbaren Fülle sein.<br/>Die Perks überlassen Euch die Wahl, ob Ihr bei der Investition ins NICHTS meine Begleitung wünscht - oder ob Ihr restlos frei von jeglicher Absicht und Prognose ins stille NICHTS zu investieren wagt.<br/>Vom schieren Investieren ins reine NICHTS, bis zu kurzen oder längeren begleiteten Sessions im 'Nicht-Raum' (über Telefon-Skype-Viber, im Yogaraum oder an Naturplätzen Ikarias) ist alles möglich. Ich freue mich auf die Begegnung mit Euch im NICHTS auf Ikaria und auch anderswo. Und über die Ergebnisse meiner künstlerischen Erforschung des NICHTS halte ich Euch ebenfalls gerne auf dem Laufenden.</p>
<p>Für welche Art NICHTS-Investition Ihr Euch auch immer entscheidet, ich freue mich auf dieses Spiel, dieses Experiment mit Euch - Eure Liebe, Eure 'Subversivität' und Euren MUT!!</p>
<p>Ihr seid grandios! Danke! Und hoch lebe sie, die Fülle im NICHTS, die Fülle in der 'Lücke' - inmitten unserer durchorganisierten Leistungskultur!</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>3. Hintergrund/ Entstehung der Projektidee</h2>
<p>Ein Bühnenunfall am 21.August 2014 riss mich als Schauspielerin (Regisseurin &amp; Potential Coach) jäh aus meinem bisherigen Leben und ich lernte zwangsläufig (doch endlich!) von heute auf morgen das Still-Liegen und Verweilen - das 'NICHTS tun', das 'NICHTS wollen', das 'Aufgeben', das 'Hingeben' kennen.</p>
<p>Ich praktizierte schon viele Jahre vor dem Unfall Meditation und Yoga. Doch nach dem Unfall erst lernte und lerne ich in aller Konsequenz, was es heisst, 'nur' zu SEIN, bzw. 'Mit-dem-NICHTS-sein'.</p>
<p>Und in diesem SEIN, in diesem erlebten IM NICHTS SEIN, packte mich und entdeckte ich dann mit einem Mal diese schiere Fülle - erlebte ich die Potenz des stillen Seins - die Potenz des NICHTS: das gefühlte schiere Glück! Und Magie - bzw. der 'magnetische' Raum - fing an mit mir zu sprechen...</p>
<p>Auch wenn vieles in dieser Zeit nach dem Unfall sehr schlimm war und mich neben den Schmerzen auch die Angst immer wieder packte (als selbständige Künstlerin war ich zum Beispiel bezüglich dem Unfall und seinen Folgen nicht abgesichert...), hat mich diese spezifische Stille- und Glücks-Erfahrung so sehr überrascht; hat sie meine Kapazitäten (als Künstlerin, als Mensch und in der Heilung) so sehr verstärkt, dass das 'stille NICHTS' mittlerweile wie von selbst das neue Selbstverständnis meiner Kunst und Arbeit geworden ist - und eine Erfahrung, die ich gerne über meine künstlerische Arbeit hinaus mit Euch teilen möchte. Deshalb BIG NOTHING als Projekt, von dem ich hoffe, dass es 'unser gemeinsames' wird!</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>4. BIG NOTHING &amp; die westlich geprägte Leistungs- und Konsumkultur</h2>
<p>Der Blick auf die westliche, dem TUN &amp; HABEN verpflichtete Gesellschaft lässt mich vermuten, dass eine Investition ins NICHTS mittlerweile der subversivste persönliche, gesellschaftliche, politische und künstlerische Akt ist, den wir - als von uns SELBST entfremdete HUMAN DOINGS - im 'Rasen der Zeit' und im Kontext unserer Gier nach immer mehr - überhaupt noch vollziehen können.</p>
<p>Und nur in diesem subversivsten Akt einer Investition ins NICHTS, bzw. in die tiefste innere Stille der Dinge hinein, sehe ich noch eine Möglichkeit, dass wir westlich geprägten Menschen vielleicht doch noch irgendwann wieder vom HUMAN DOING zurück zu unserem eigentlichen Wesen als HUMAN BEING finden - und die Erde sich vielleicht mit uns doch noch versöhnt - und uns weiter nährt.</p>
<p>Es liegt an uns. Der Reichtum ist da. Und spielend lässt er sich besonders gern erschliessen. Lasst es uns versuchen! JETZT! :)</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>4. Zusammenfassung:</h2>
<p>Das Grosse (stille) NICHTSPROJEKT…</p>
<p>... ist ein Kunstprojekt zur Erfahung des NICHTS, des 'stillen Seins', des NICHT-MEHR-TUNS und jener Fülle und Kraft, die wir erleben können, in Momenten, in denen wir jegliche Erwartung, Vorstellung und Bewertung losgelassen haben...<br/><br/>... ist ein Kunstprojekt, welches Künstler und Investoren, die gleichzeitig auch die Rezipienten (das Publikum) des Projekts sind, von Anfang an in eine gleichgestellte Beziehung setzt und in welchem sowohl Künstler als auch das investierende Publikum/ Rezipient Geben und Nehmen in einer Balance erleben können - bzw. alle am Projekt Beteiligtenden gemeinsam eine sowohl individuelle als auch kollektive Erfahrung mit dem NICHTS (dem 'Nicht-Raum') machen.</p>
<p>... ist ein Experiment mit dem NICHT-Raum, an dessen Anfang lediglich eine vage und offene Vorstellung von einem möglichen künstlerischen 'Endprodukt' (ein Film, ein Buch, live Performance Acts zum 'stillen Nichts', etc.) steht, welche jedoch für das Projekt selber nicht ausschlaggebend ist - weil es sich erst noch kristallisieren wird, welches Endergebnis aus dem NICHT-Raum der sich an diesem Projekt beteiligenden, investierenden Menschen hervorgehen wird. Eure Investitionen und Erlebnisse sind es also, die das Projekt in seiner Fülle und seinem Ausdruck definieren. (Als Beispiel s. Gabriele Sigg's Artikel über ihre Reise ins NICHTS auf der Insel Ikaria in der Tattva Viveka, Nov2016 - oder mein Artikel zum Weiblichen Prinzip und dessen Terminologie in der gleichen Tattva Viveka Ausgabe). Es geht hier um CO-KREIEREN als Ausdruck des Auflebens des Weiblichen Prinzips in unserer Welt. Und je mehr Menschen ins NICHTS zu investieren wagen, umso grösser wird die WELLE an Erleben und Fülle sein, die letztendlich mit BIG NOTHING als Werk auch auch einen künstlerischen Ausdruck findet.  :)</p>
<p>... ist eine Art 'Public Art Projekt', bei dem Du schon in der Phase der Finanzierung eingeladen bist, die konkrete inhaltliche Erfahung mit dem Nicht-Raum (bzw. der 'weiblich-somatischen'/ 'magnetischen' Qualität) zu machen. (s. Perks)</p>

*************************************************************'NOTHINGNESS is the gap between things we look at – the gap between all we know and between all we’ve learnt so far – the gap between every inbreath and outbreath – the gap where YOUR life and liveliness, your beauty, your strength, your true potential comes in. Such gap is pure magic and thus the ALL and the EVERYTHING.' 
Thus, 'BIG NOTHING/ Das Projekt zum ALLEM im NICHTS' as an evolving Conscious Art work is about YOU audaciously investing in such gap and rejoicing its intrinsic love and beauty - it's about YOU investing in NOTHING - for to experience big magnetic magic fading in.' *************************************************************
'Das NICHTS (bzw. die NICHT-HEIT) ist die Lücke zwischen den Dingen, die wir sehen - die Lücke zwischen all dem, was wir wissen und bisher gelernt haben - die Lücke zwischen jedem Einatmen und jedem Ausatmen - die Lücke, durch die hindurch DEIN Leben und DEINE Lebendigkeit, Deine Schönheit, Deine Stärke, Dein wahres Potential fortwährend dringt.'
Und 'BIG NOTHING/ Das Projekt zum ALLEM im NICHTS' ist ein wachsendes BewusstSein-Kunst-Projekt, in welchem Du in dieser Lücke - durch Deine Investition, Deine Hingabe an das NICHTS  - an das NICHT-WISSEN, das NICHT-BEURTEILEN und das NICHT-ERWARTEN - Dein persönliches und unser kollektives Potential erschliesst - und über diese Deine Erfahrung mit der Magie im NICHTS vielleicht sogar berichtest.

Urania Mytika – Ikarian Artist - on BIG NOTHING (10.6.2016):'Dear Simone! I don’t know how you do it, but I still cannot believe all those little miracles happened in my life since I met you and the Big Nothing! Precious!!!!!’
Welcome to BIG NOTHING - Das Projekt zum Allem im NICHTS! 
 
Latest UPDATE - BIG NOTHING's 3rd round on Indiegogo:
Since BIG NOTHING's very birth as a Crowd- and Contentfunding project on Indiegogo on March 8th 2016, more and more people have felt inspired to test the magic-magnetic quality of NOTHINGNESS by audaciously investing time and money into NOTHING. Some invested into sheer NOTHINGNESS, others booked a coaching/ healing session on the matter or even engaged in the NOTHINGNESS Process. Again others undertook, inspired and guided by BIG NOTHING, a 'magic-magnetic trip' into the mystery of NOTHINGNESS' here on the NOTHNGNESS island Ikaria in the Aegaen Sea (s. article from Gabriele Maria Sigg in Tattva Viveka), whereas again others felt simply attracted by the cutting edge nature of BIG NOTHING as an evolving conscious art project in which everyone investing into NOTHINGNESS by 'cosmic law' becomes a magic-magnetic part of the work... And there were again others who just felt happy to contribute to my research on NOTHINGNESS and the Feminine-Somatic Principle here on the island -  which is very likely to be informing a later book, an installation and in a longer run a film... 
So far, around 5700 $ have been raised and invested into BIG NOTHING and my exciting work on the matter by first courageious NOTHINGNESS-pioneers. Now with this 3rd Crowd- and Contentfunding let's go far beyond - let's make BIG NOTHING a financial and thus political statement. Let it be millions for NOTHINGNESS (instead of war!) - and thus millions for sheer magnetic beauty, vitality and love which through BIG NOTHING (NOTHINGNESS) manifest once we let go of our fears.
Become the president and lover you'd wish to see in the world. Make healing possible - by stepping and investing into NOTHING as the feminine-somatic way to BE.
Let's start now! Let's create a wave - revealing and setting off the 'Magic magnetic EVERYTHING' hidden in the apparently blunt NOTHING.

Project description in English
1. Welcome to BIG NOTHING!
Have you ever spent money for NOTHING? ...
If so, this project is YOUR chance (and maybe our shared blessing) if you charmingly do it again!
However, this time, you are invited to invest in NOTHING in your right mind and with your fullest awareness – so that you are open enough to RECEIVE the fullest of the hidden riches ‘NOTHINGNESS’ has on offer – for your heart, your soul, your health, your life - when ‘giving’! :)
With the support of this project, you are given the unique opportunity and platform, to experiment with the nature of NOTHINGNESS by consciously investing in NOTHING, i.e. in the ‘Non-Space’, in ‘The Big Void’, in ‘the gap’, in ‘the silence’…  – and as such to make an entirely new experience with what we usually are trying to avoid: the confrontation with NOTHING...
Maybe investing in NOTHING or being confronted with NOTHING sometimes feels a bit like facing death? At least, ‘Big Void’ does ask for courage, sometimes even for audacity – and definitely for the relaxation of ‘logic brain’. And many people shy away from BIG NOTHING and ‘hide’ in what they call ‘real’. I would say, within our ‘logic brain’ and profit-oriented culture it is definitely an act of subversion to dare and face BIG NOTHING – let alone to invest in it! :)
So welcome to both - the subversive and the loving side in you! Get your 'guts' together - and dare to spend your money here - on NOTHING!
 
2. About BIG NOTHING
The BIG NOTHING project seeks from its very start to stimulate in a very playful and experimental way the idea and insight in you that NOTHING - or NOTHINGNESS - is never nothing. On the contrary. BIG NOTHING is always full. Full of sheer abundance, options, love and joy - ready to materialise, as long as you remain open and courageous enough to keep engaged with those hidden riches and creative powers such ‘silent unknown’ has on offer. To invest in BIG NOTHING could mean that you might experience NOTHING at first, but maybe loads in a longer run. It may also mean that you are asked to transform your time-based/ logic brain mentality into a more ‘magnetic’ one…  And here’s the point where meditation or my DACA technique and NOTHINGNESS Process Coaching may be of help... (s. Perks to your right)
 
3. Purpose & Experience
The feeling of happiness, bliss and love that you might experience when investing your money here and now in NOTHING – while expecting NOTHING - is the magic power of NOTHINGNESS and thus not only the project’s research topic, but also its highest goal and nature. The miracles or synchronicities you might eventually start to experience when consciously spending money on our shared BIGmagneticNOTHING belong to the realm of what I call ‘magnetic power’ or ‘somatic-feminine quality’ which I view as the counterpart to the ‘analytical-masculine quality’ or ‘logic brain’.
If you would like to find out more about my research in the ‘somatic-feminine’, you are very welcome to visit my new blog https://bloggingfeminine.wordpress.com/blogging... or my artwork in film and theatre (s. info below) or you join me in a healing/ coaching session, Meditation or Yoga class (s. Perks and Meditation/ Yoga classes updates on FB & www.potentialcoaching.de). :)
There is also my article on the Feminine Principle and its terminology coming out in Tattva Viveka on November 15th 2016.
 
4. BIG NOTHING's very nature
Now: the more people we are here, on this very platform, who are brave enough to subversively invest big and small sums of money in NOTHING - and who make a NOTHINGNESS experience at the same time, the more abundant and powerful the BIG NOTHING project’s result will be in the end! And watch the traces life embraces – when you let BIG NOTHING ‘speak’. ;)
The more people supporting this project, the bigger and more ground-breaking the BIG NOTHING’s output and effect as an art project and ‘life-transformer’ will be. That’s the very nature of this project. NOTHING more.
Maybe there will be (amongst many other things) a finished film coming out of BIG NOTHING, or a book, or a healing art installation reflecting on my and your NOTHINGNESS experiences. Or maybe you’ll meet your NOTHINGNESS on my personal BIG NOTHING island and research place Ikaria. Whichever. The biggest reward when investing in NOTHING is the experience of NOTHINGNESS in itself – the experience of its ‘talking’, of its wisdom, its creative powers, which are being unlocked in the moment you dare to know NOTHING, to expect NOTHING, to plan NOTHING. In such moments you are free – you feel expanded. You may even feel love. Maybe this project allows you to flow with such momentum and experience of freedom and expansion a tiny little bit longer, letting you taste its smell. At least that’s what I experienced after I had to face BIG NOTHING for months due to a stage accident… And in bringing now the fruits of such experience into the world and to you personally, fills me up with a very deep happiness and joy.
I thank you so much for joining in – and play the ‘game’ with me! :)
 
5. About the Perks
If you look at the NOTHINGNESS Perks to your right, you’ll find out what kind of investment suits you best to make BIG NOTHING work – for yourself and as a collective experience. And from the very moment you make your investment, this project starts to blossom. That’s the beauty of it. It exists as soon as YOU start it. Please make it big! And please, spread the words! BE the proof that BIG NOTHING is not nothing, but EVERTHING beyond love!
When choosing your Perk (i.e. your investing amount and your specific version of playing the BIG NOTHING ‘game’/experiment), you have the choice to either make an investment into ‘plain NOTHINGNESS’ or to invest in a guided version within the BIG NOTHING experience.
Whichever you choose, I’m so happy and grateful that you join this subversive experiment and game, which hopefully brings up lots of magic and abundant personal and collective experience – and helps many of you to grow - i.e. finding back their love, bliss and joy. And please do not use too much ‘logic brain’ when you read this and start acting along this suggested scheme! ;)
Thank you so much for your courage, audacity, love & support. You ARE amazing!
 
6. THE BIG NOTHING's Summery
The BIGmagneticNOTHING….
… is an art project encouraging its investors and audience to enter a shared experience with NOTHINGNESS and opening up for individual & experience-based proof that NOTHING is never NOTHING, but EVERYTHING beyond love – in the moment when we allow ourselves to shift focus from ‘logic’ brain to ‘somatic’ brain.
… is – at its very beginning - an art project in which the project investors are at the same time the project's receivers/ audience.
… is an art project which comes to life as soon as its investors and receivers start investing money in BIG NOTHING.
… is an art project which scale and extent is dependent on its investors/ audience degree of subversiveness and ‘appetite’ to spend money for/ in NOTHING.
… is a process-oriented experiment with the ‘Non-Space’ (the ‘Big Void’) which has no concrete intent regarding its final outcome. There might be a film, a book or live Performance Acts arising out of the project and the experience with BIG NOTHING. However, the projects emphasis does not lay on a previously defined final product, but on the process itself, the shared experience and the questions it triggers.
 
7. How BIG NOTHING came to birth...
A stage accident on August 21st 2014 injured not only my head, but also my day-to-day functioning and identity up to that very day. From one moment to the next, I hit bottom and I was forced to keep completely still. It kind of felt like an ‘order of life’, so to speak. I could do NOTHING about it. I could do NOTHING for it, nor against it. It didn’t help when I moaned, it didn’t help when I planned nor when I made some prognoses about the speed of my healing. All I had to learn from that moment onwards was to dare facing NOTHING and rejoicing its stillness – and eventually its magic.
As an actress (director and coach) I had also been working self-employed. And for the performance on that very night I was not insured - as it turned out along the unfolding of the accident’s repercussions... Thus, to me in this very situation, hitting bottom and facing NOTHING did not only mean stopping the ‘Doing’, but also stopping earning money by means of ‘Doing’. And that to me felt at first really scary...
For a long time it looked like I was losing everything. No longer being able to resolve my situation by acts of ‘Doing’ was something I felt very foreign to and which thus created so much fear in the beginning of such NOTHINGNESS 'process'. Bound to the sickbed, I felt there was NOTHING I could actively do to save myself. However, there I still was - and there I still am. And in such experience of BIG NOTHING, I came to taste the fruits of surrender, the fruits of BEING as a HUMAN BEING - in moments we manage to rid ourselves of the fear we picked up on and internalized through social conditioning and past traumatic experience...
I now know that NOTHING is never NOTHING, but EVERYTHING you are asking for.
And it’s been so much I gained since I learnt to let BIG NOTHING do the ‘work’.
I had been a Meditation and Yoga practitioner for over 20 years before the accident, but it was only some months after the accident when I started to access and receive the NOTHINGNESS’ fullest bliss.
From the moment I embraced the fact that there was NOTHING I could do other than to surrender, the situation (at least inside myself) turned round and I started hitting heights. All the sudden – and more and more often – I felt at complete ease with the situation I was in, despite the physical pain and the subsequent emotional condition and turbulence that still kept occurring. All the sudden a feeling of deep happiness and abundance that was no longer related to the concrete circumstances of my sickbed situation entered my life. And such experience was quite something.
Because, it made me understand that NOTHING is not NOTHING, but EVERYTHING embracing love, joy, opportunities and happiness – if we do dare to enter a dialogue with the ‘BIG VOID’.
This experience changed my life for ever and let me understand the nature of healing and ‘magnetic power’ to a greater depth. And this is how BIG NOTHING as evolving Conscious ART work is born. It grows with YOU and ME. And our connection in the 'BE!'. 8. More about the artist

Willkommen im 'BIG NOTHING - Das Projekt zum Allem im NICHTS! 

Die Neuigkeiten zum Projekt:
BIG NOTHING/ Das Projekt zum Allem im NICHTS' in seiner derzeitigen Entwicklungsphase, wie als späteres Buch-/ Filmprojekt, möchte einen erfahrbaren Raum schaffen, in dem die Fülle von NICHTS-Momenten und deren Magie vom Rezipienten als (heilsame) Realität wahrgenommen und das Leben in dieser Fülle und Liebe damit erlernt werden kann.
Am 8.März 2016 ging BIG NOTHING als 'Das Grosse NICHTS Projekt' auf Indiegogo das erste Mal 60 Tage lang online, im Sommer als 'Das Projekt zur Fülle im NICHTS' zum zweiten Mal. Durch erste mutige Ins-NICHTS-Hineinschenkende kamen bisher ca. 5'700 $ magische NICHTS-Investitionen zusammen. Und mit dieser 3. Runde soll 'BIG NOTHING/ Das Projekt zum Allem im NICHTS' nun ganz offiziell in Richtung 'Start' rücken. Eine eigene Projekt-Webseite wird diesen konkreten Startschuss letztlich dann markieren.  So die konkrete Vorstellung. Doch vielleicht started das Projekt schon vorher durch? ;)
Also bitte macht BIG NOTHING jetzt schon 'really biiggg'! :) Nutzt gern auch die Coaching Perks zu Eurer rechten Seite - um Euch der Magie im NICHTS (und des Weiblichen Prinzips) durch eine geführte Meditation, eine Mindfulness oder Healing Session - oder durch einen NOTHINGNESS Prozess oder eine Reise ins NICHTS Ikarias (s. Artikel v. Gabriele Sigg in der Tattva Viveka) vertraut zu machen.  Aus der Fülle-Erfahrung jedes/ jeder einzelnen Schenkenden heraus kann BIG NOTHING als Conscious Art Werk immer weiterwachsen - bis die subjektive und kollektive Erfahrung mit dem NICHTS letztlich das konkrete KUNSTWERK wird. Mache Du diese bezaubernde magische Welle möglich! Investiere jetzt ganz kühn ins JETZT! Und das Buch zum NICHTS, die Installation und der Film dazu werden folgen.

Projektbeschreibung auf Deutsch:
1. Die Fülle im NICHTS: Projektbeschreibung
1.1. Das NICHTS & die FÜLLE
Einmal mehr für ‚Nichts‘ Geld ausgeben!  Das ist das Projekt. Nur dieses eine Mal ganz bewusst - und dabei FÜLLE erleben! Wie geht denn das?! :)
Mit der Unterstützung dieses Projekts bekommst Du die Möglichkeit und Plattform geschenkt, eine neue Erfahrung/ ein Experiment mit dem NICHTS zu machen.
Das Projekt dient - schon im Prozess seiner Entstehung - als Spielfläche der Erkenntnis, dass das NICHTS nie nichts ist, sondern immer auch ein Vakuum schierer Fülle und Liebe beinhaltet - also letztendlich reines 'Lebenselixier' ist ... solange Du Dich auf diese Qualität, d.h. die im NICHTS geborgene Schaffens- und Kreativkraft einlässt und Du 'subversiv' genug bist, einmal für länger NICHTS zu erleben und/ oder Dein Geld einfach einmal bewusst ins NICHTS zu investieren. Kommt dann wirklich NICHTS zurück?
Deine Erfahrung mit dem NICHTS ist Inhalt des Projekts!
1.2. Das NICHTS/ Die 'Nicht-Heit' als Momentum
In diesem Projekt, welches das NICHTS zum Thema macht, steht die im NICHTS (oder in der 'Lücke') erlebbare FÜLLE im Zentrum. Das Glücksgefühl, welches Du (von mir begleitet oder nicht) durch Deine Investition ins NICHTS (s. Perks rechts) womöglich erleben wirst, ist der höchste Sinn dieses Projekts - welches sich ferner auch mit der im NICHTS verankerten 'weiblich-somatischen'/ 'magnetischen' Kreativkraft (als Gegenpol zur 'männlich-analytischen' Kreativkraft) auseinandersetzt. Ein Themenkreis, welcher mich seit meinem Bühnenunfall am 21. August 2014 künstlerisch intensiver beschäftigt (s. auch https://bloggingfeminine.wordpress.com/blogging...)  - und aus welchem vielleicht einmal ein Film entsteht und/ oder ein Buch.
Je mehr Menschen JETZT für dieses Projekt mit grossen und mit kleinen Summen ganz subversiv ins NICHTS investieren - desto kraftvoller wird die damit erzeugte Fülle sein. Und nach und nach wird diese Fülle auch äusserlich sicht- und erlebbar werden. In Deinem Leben wie in meinem. Wenn wir uns dafür öffnen. Lasst uns also diesen Moment gemeinsam kreieren! :)
 
1.3. Deine persönliche Erfahrung mit dem NICHTS als Teil des Gesamtwerks
Kommt eine grosse, mutige Masse an NICHTS Investititionen hier bei diesem Crowdfunding (und hoffentlich bald auch auf einer eigenen Webseite) zusammen, steht am Ende tatsächlich auch ein künstlerisches Werk. Doch dieses Werk, bzw. ein im Vorfeld anvisiertes und definiertes Endprodukt, ist nicht das erste Ziel dieses Projekts. Das Ziel ist Eure/ Deine individuelle (und damit auch kollektive) Erfahrung mit dem NICHTS und das Erleben, dass das eigentlich Gewinnbringende am Investieren ins NICHTS das NICHTS selber ist - die Erfahrung seiner Schöpfungs-Potenz. Und diese Schöpfungspotenz und Kreativkraft erschliesst sich erst über unseren aller Mut, NICHTS zu wissen, NICHTS zu erwarten, NICHTS zu planen, wenn wir ins NICHTS investieren. Im NICHTS begegnen wir dem SELBST. Und nur wenn wir das NICHTS wirklich an uns heran lassen und es aushalten, kann es seine Kraft und Liebe erschliessen und ein Tor sein zu unserem persönlichen Glück. Und dieses Glück, das durch Deine/ Eure Investition ins NICHTS entsteht, wünsche ich Dir und Euch von Herzen.
 
2. Die Perks
Eure Investition - Euer Vertrauen ins NICHTS!
Schaut gerne bei den Perks (rechts aussen), wie Ihr das NICHTS mit mir zusammen in Schwingung bringen könnt. Von dem Moment an, an dem Ihr hier mutig und mit Spiellust ins NICHTS investiert, fängt dieses Projekt an zu erblühen. Und jeder Betrag, jede einzelne Erfahrung von und mit Euch wird ein Beitrag dieser aus dem NICHTS entspringenden und kollektiv erlebbaren Fülle sein.Die Perks überlassen Euch die Wahl, ob Ihr bei der Investition ins NICHTS meine Begleitung wünscht - oder ob Ihr restlos frei von jeglicher Absicht und Prognose ins stille NICHTS zu investieren wagt.Vom schieren Investieren ins reine NICHTS, bis zu kurzen oder längeren begleiteten Sessions im 'Nicht-Raum' (über Telefon-Skype-Viber, im Yogaraum oder an Naturplätzen Ikarias) ist alles möglich. Ich freue mich auf die Begegnung mit Euch im NICHTS auf Ikaria und auch anderswo. Und über die Ergebnisse meiner künstlerischen Erforschung des NICHTS halte ich Euch ebenfalls gerne auf dem Laufenden.
Für welche Art NICHTS-Investition Ihr Euch auch immer entscheidet, ich freue mich auf dieses Spiel, dieses Experiment mit Euch - Eure Liebe, Eure 'Subversivität' und Euren MUT!!
Ihr seid grandios! Danke! Und hoch lebe sie, die Fülle im NICHTS, die Fülle in der 'Lücke' - inmitten unserer durchorganisierten Leistungskultur!
 
3. Hintergrund/ Entstehung der Projektidee
Ein Bühnenunfall am 21.August 2014 riss mich als Schauspielerin (Regisseurin & Potential Coach) jäh aus meinem bisherigen Leben und ich lernte zwangsläufig (doch endlich!) von heute auf morgen das Still-Liegen und Verweilen - das 'NICHTS tun', das 'NICHTS wollen', das 'Aufgeben', das 'Hingeben' kennen.
Ich praktizierte schon viele Jahre vor dem Unfall Meditation und Yoga. Doch nach dem Unfall erst lernte und lerne ich in aller Konsequenz, was es heisst, 'nur' zu SEIN, bzw. 'Mit-dem-NICHTS-sein'.
Und in diesem SEIN, in diesem erlebten IM NICHTS SEIN, packte mich und entdeckte ich dann mit einem Mal diese schiere Fülle - erlebte ich die Potenz des stillen Seins - die Potenz des NICHTS: das gefühlte schiere Glück! Und Magie - bzw. der 'magnetische' Raum - fing an mit mir zu sprechen...
Auch wenn vieles in dieser Zeit nach dem Unfall sehr schlimm war und mich neben den Schmerzen auch die Angst immer wieder packte (als selbständige Künstlerin war ich zum Beispiel bezüglich dem Unfall und seinen Folgen nicht abgesichert...), hat mich diese spezifische Stille- und Glücks-Erfahrung so sehr überrascht; hat sie meine Kapazitäten (als Künstlerin, als Mensch und in der Heilung) so sehr verstärkt, dass das 'stille NICHTS' mittlerweile wie von selbst das neue Selbstverständnis meiner Kunst und Arbeit geworden ist - und eine Erfahrung, die ich gerne über meine künstlerische Arbeit hinaus mit Euch teilen möchte. Deshalb BIG NOTHING als Projekt, von dem ich hoffe, dass es 'unser gemeinsames' wird!
 
4. BIG NOTHING & die westlich geprägte Leistungs- und Konsumkultur
Der Blick auf die westliche, dem TUN & HABEN verpflichtete Gesellschaft lässt mich vermuten, dass eine Investition ins NICHTS mittlerweile der subversivste persönliche, gesellschaftliche, politische und künstlerische Akt ist, den wir - als von uns SELBST entfremdete HUMAN DOINGS - im 'Rasen der Zeit' und im Kontext unserer Gier nach immer mehr - überhaupt noch vollziehen können.
Und nur in diesem subversivsten Akt einer Investition ins NICHTS, bzw. in die tiefste innere Stille der Dinge hinein, sehe ich noch eine Möglichkeit, dass wir westlich geprägten Menschen vielleicht doch noch irgendwann wieder vom HUMAN DOING zurück zu unserem eigentlichen Wesen als HUMAN BEING finden - und die Erde sich vielleicht mit uns doch noch versöhnt - und uns weiter nährt.
Es liegt an uns. Der Reichtum ist da. Und spielend lässt er sich besonders gern erschliessen. Lasst es uns versuchen! JETZT! :)
 
4. Zusammenfassung:
Das Grosse (stille) NICHTSPROJEKT…
... ist ein Kunstprojekt zur Erfahung des NICHTS, des 'stillen Seins', des NICHT-MEHR-TUNS und jener Fülle und Kraft, die wir erleben können, in Momenten, in denen wir jegliche Erwartung, Vorstellung und Bewertung losgelassen haben...... ist ein Kunstprojekt, welches Künstler und Investoren, die gleichzeitig auch die Rezipienten (das Publikum) des Projekts sind, von Anfang an in eine gleichgestellte Beziehung setzt und in welchem sowohl Künstler als auch das investierende Publikum/ Rezipient Geben und Nehmen in einer Balance erleben können - bzw. alle am Projekt Beteiligtenden gemeinsam eine sowohl individuelle als auch kollektive Erfahrung mit dem NICHTS (dem 'Nicht-Raum') machen.
... ist ein Experiment mit dem NICHT-Raum, an dessen Anfang lediglich eine vage und offene Vorstellung von einem möglichen künstlerischen 'Endprodukt' (ein Film, ein Buch, live Performance Acts zum 'stillen Nichts', etc.) steht, welche jedoch für das Projekt selber nicht ausschlaggebend ist - weil es sich erst noch kristallisieren wird, welches Endergebnis aus dem NICHT-Raum der sich an diesem Projekt beteiligenden, investierenden Menschen hervorgehen wird. Eure Investitionen und Erlebnisse sind es also, die das Projekt in seiner Fülle und seinem Ausdruck definieren. (Als Beispiel s. Gabriele Sigg's Artikel über ihre Reise ins NICHTS auf der Insel Ikaria in der Tattva Viveka, Nov2016 - oder mein Artikel zum Weiblichen Prinzip und dessen Terminologie in der gleichen Tattva Viveka Ausgabe). Es geht hier um CO-KREIEREN als Ausdruck des Auflebens des Weiblichen Prinzips in unserer Welt. Und je mehr Menschen ins NICHTS zu investieren wagen, umso grösser wird die WELLE an Erleben und Fülle sein, die letztendlich mit BIG NOTHING als Werk auch auch einen künstlerischen Ausdruck findet.  :)
... ist eine Art 'Public Art Projekt', bei dem Du schon in der Phase der Finanzierung eingeladen bist, die konkrete inhaltliche Erfahung mit dem Nicht-Raum (bzw. der 'weiblich-somatischen'/ 'magnetischen' Qualität) zu machen. (s. Perks)

We hope to be able to put in orders and get you your schwag sooner, if possible.Quality: What you see on our page are low-res renderings. Prior to sending off for production, we'll be ensuring that all designs are made in high resolution, and, where applicable, vector graphics. We are selecting vendors that we can all trust will deliver quality goods you'd be excited to wear. Find & Follow Us, We're Official ;-)

The pace I have to work at in order to maintain balance and well being for everyone concerned is a feat unto itself.  I am blessed to have a wonderful group of people who stand by me, who both support and challenge my decisions (including my own children:) They keep me real and all are cheering me on and helping to make this project to be a success. Thank you all.

<div>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">My name is Ben Miller. I'm a graduate of Wright State University in Dayton, Ohio with a B.F.A. in Acting. Originally from Columbus, Ohio I now live in New York City. In school, I co-wrote and produced a new musical called <i>Different</i> and I also directed numerous shows in our student-run Jubilee Theater including <i>Baggage, Yelling Fire in a Burning Theatre, </i>and<i> Different</i>. My own original work, <i>Lightbulb, </i>was accepted into the Venus/Adonis Festival/Competition opening in March of 2016. </span></p>
<blockquote><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><i>Plot Summary: John is an out of work wannabe playwright. With a deadline for a festival fast approaching, he’s trying to come up with something original, but it seems that all his ideas have been done before. With the help of a bartender, his girlfriend, a loyal bar patron, and a prostitute, John hopes to find something new he can feel proud of. This one act comedy is an original play made up of some not so original ideas. </i></span></blockquote>
<p>From the Venus/Adonis Team:</p>
<blockquote><span style=""font-style: italic; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">""Please know that we choose the most original, fresh and dynamic plays from among the submissions we receive. We've chosen your work because we believe your show will bring invaluable inspiration to our festival.""</span></blockquote>

</div></div>","Summary

My name is Ben Miller. I'm a graduate of Wright State University in Dayton, Ohio with a B.F.A. in Acting. Originally from Columbus, Ohio I now live in New York City. In school, I co-wrote and produced a new musical called Different and I also directed numerous shows in our student-run Jubilee Theater including Baggage, Yelling Fire in a Burning Theatre, and Different. My own original work, Lightbulb, was accepted into the Venus/Adonis Festival/Competition opening in March of 2016. 
Plot Summary: John is an out of work wannabe playwright. With a deadline for a festival fast approaching, he’s trying to come up with something original, but it seems that all his ideas have been done before. With the help of a bartender, his girlfriend, a loyal bar patron, and a prostitute, John hopes to find something new he can feel proud of. This one act comedy is an original play made up of some not so original ideas. 
From the Venus/Adonis Team:
""Please know that we choose the most original, fresh and dynamic plays from among the submissions we receive. We've chosen your work because we believe your show will bring invaluable inspiration to our festival.""
   Funding The funding for this project will be used for the following expenses:


Application Fee
Videographer 
Rehearsal Space
Props/Costumes
Actor/Stage Manager Stipend

    The Impact This campaign is a first-in-a-lifetime event. I am excited to be producing and directing my own show, at a Theater Festival in New York City. This is a huge opportunity for networking with professionals and other budding playwrights not only for myself, but for the actors as well. This truly is the start of something wonderful and exciting. It would mean the world to me, as a director, to be able to pay my actors for their services as well as cover the other expenses associated with this production.

    THANK YOU! Thank you so much for your consideration! Please help me spread the word about this campaign and reach our goal. Every contribution will be greatly appreciated!

<h3>The Back Cover Summary of WTCFN</h3>
<p>Don't we all want to escape into stories, away from what the Universe has in store for us?<br/><br/>Nyx Ripley-Rowan has a few bones to pick with the Universe herself. It seems to be throwing punches left and right, leaving Nyx to always be on guard (except around her best friend, Basil).<br/>The biggest blow involves her grandfather, Elias Orion Rowan, the famed author of the beloved book series <i>POTENTIAL ENERGY</i>. It is the series Nyx held so dear to her for so long, the series that Nyx helped Elias create...that is until the fourth book was released and Elias shut Nyx out, without ever giving her a reason why. Before he ever could, or they could make amends, Elias passed away. But, instead of just leaving Nyx with bitter memories, Elias left Nyx something else. In his will, Elias left Nyx the unfinished manuscript for the series' final book: <i>THE SEARCHING SOUL.</i> <br/>Having skirted around the problem of finishing the book out of spite, and out of not wanting to confront the emotions and memories Elias left her, Nyx is ready to let it rot and never be finished. But, the book and stories are done waiting. It seems that THAVMA, the world of <i>POTENTIAL ENERGY</i>, is picking up where book six left off in Nyx's hometown, complete with characters, creatures...and the curse that threatens to bring Nyx's life and her whole world to a crumbling end if she doesn't figure out an ending soon. <br/>It's up to Nyx, with Basil by her side to find what she's been missing, and face the ghosts that haunt her between the words not to just bring an ending to <i>THE SEARCHING SOUL,</i> but also to the pain and grief that have been in her vise-like grip for so long.</p>
<h3>The Backstory of this Campaign</h3>
<p>I take two sides of my creative life - the writer and the illustrator - and use them both in my master's program, MFA Visual Narrative, to create new and awe-inspiring stories in all sorts of ways and mediums. Since the beginning of last summer, I have been developing the concept, pitch, and overall being that has become my thesis that is practically my baby. I've raised it into the strapping young thing it has become, and am working out the final edits to make it as perfect as it possibly can to give to you! </p>
<p>Nyx's story mirrors mine in a few ways - aside from the whole, you know, story world coming for my blood sort of thing - when it comes to her feelings towards being left behind, feeling at odds with the world, and how stories define and are what we are. There are many stories in each of our lives, and it takes time to get through those epic tales and find the endings that bring us to the beginning of the next. This is why sharing this story is so important for me to share, I want others to know that their stories are continuing and their adventures are starting each day, and the power their creativity and courage have to define what they are and who they choose to be. I want to inspire others with my story to find their own worlds and galaxies, and share them with the world. <br/><br/>With this illustrated novel, I plan to share with your worlds that I've created through my words and my illustrations, and let you get lost in Nyx's story and just enjoy. <br/>Also, the book series within the book, <i>Potential Energy</i>, is a fully fleshed out saga from an independent study I did in undergrad where I created my own 'animated movie' visual concepts. You can learn more about Nyx and Elias' collaboration at <a href=""https://potentialenergysaga.com/the-saga-1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">potentialenergyseries.com/the-saga</a></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Actual Book</h3>
<p>The final product that I'm aiming to have printed thanks to this campaign is soft/hardcover, full-color copies. The book is about 440 pages long and is 6in x 9 in. (Even as a soft cover, it has much heft! My dummy copies are toning my arms as I carry them about.) All the writing and illustrations within, and including the book cover, where done by me. <br/><br/>***ALL PHYSICAL COPIES WILL BE SIGNED***<br/><br/>Example of an illustrated page: <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1554415610/l4fyx5lvpiyxtmal6xcd.jpg"" src=""""/><br/>(drawing these was a lot of fun, and hard work, but it really helped me get a better hand on my style and skill) </p>
<h3>Why this Campain? </h3>
<p>I'm basically a one-man-show when it comes to my thesis, I have done everything from developing the story early on to manuscript, to layouts and illustrations and finally to printing the dummy copies. Wanting to give this to the world means I want to print it and make sure they are fully colored and the illustrations are there to tell the story as strongly as it does. So, I'm using the money for this towards printing and possible merchandise for me to sell (if we get to, not too important), and work on finishing the final exhibition of the thesis, and possibly ending with an ISBN and self-publishing of the illustrated novel! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Stories are what makes us human, and we've been telling them from the dawn of time. Nyx's story is one that is both whimsical and wicked in terms of magic, and the connections to stories of everyday people, not just fictional characters. Stories of being at odds with the Universe, of being powerless against things you can't control that is happening anyway, of loss, of friendship...of completing your own story. I want others to get lost in Nyx's story and inspired to create their own galaxies and stories for others to enjoy as well. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Being a one-man-show here, aside from Aubrey who lovingly edited my manuscript, means that some things take a bit longer than having a few people working on layouts for a few chapters each at the same time. But, with the use of my dummy copies, I'm able to go through and work on it all. I am a very determined and focused person, and a hard worker, and I'm working on making this book as perfect as it possibly can be for you!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't contribute right now, it's alright, I totally understand! <br/>If you still want to help out, though, I would appreciate if you shared this campaign with everyone you know who loves a good story and fantastical creatures and fun illustrations! <br/><br/>Thank you! <br/>And, <br/>Stay wild, Star Child! <br/>&lt;3 <br/>Jellie</p>

As <a href=""http://www.blackandpink.org/pen-pals/step-1-review-our-guidelines/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Black and Pink</a> says, “Mail Call often happens in public spaces in the prison. When someone hears their name called by a prison guard during mail call it is a reminder that people on the outside care about that person.

Proceeds from the cards will support Black and Pink Chapters in Chicago, Boston, and Providence. The images will be made available to the public so that anyone can print and send the images to a loved one.

I'm setting out to tour the USA to feel the pulse of America, to feel how we humans are doing, how we're navigating this world, what's important to us and where we're going. I want to write a show about this, a show built on spontaneity and possibility, about being a human right now, about the future, about the realities we are facing and the real beauties of life.</span></font></p><p><font size=""3""><span style=""font-weight: 500;letter-spacing: 0px;"">In each stop and along the way, I'll stay with friendly folks and will take various forms of transportation along the way. Once I've arrived to the town, I'll collect interviews and stories with a simple camera and will use interviews and experiences in each town, something you could call ""research,"" to create an improv/musical show that I'll present in each town, collaborating with anyone who wants to play. </span></font></p><p><font size=""3""><span style=""font-weight: 500;letter-spacing: 0px;"">What will I do in each town? How will I make this show in each place? Using a framework I’ve developed in and around NYC, I’ll arrive and spend a day meeting and greeting, interviewing around the central question: “how are you staying alive and vital?”, listening and feeling the scene out. Think talking to new people, on-the-street interviews, spontaneous sharing, some amount of hilarity.

Once I've arrived to the town, I'll collect interviews and stories with a simple camera and will use interviews and experiences in each town, something you could call ""research,"" to create an improv/musical show that I'll present in each town, collaborating with anyone who wants to play. What will I do in each town? How will I make this show in each place? Using a framework I’ve developed in and around NYC, I’ll arrive and spend a day meeting and greeting, interviewing around the central question: “how are you staying alive and vital?”, listening and feeling the scene out.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Zora Stora is a teen owned POC small business. I created this business to spread mental health awareness amidst the global pandemic. I am selling pins that say ""Hello Im a Mental Health Advocate"". While this product was made with healthcare workers and teachers in mind anyone can wear it! The idea is for someone who is struggling with mental health to see your pin and feel comfortable talking to you about their struggles.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>If you contribute $5 you will be receiving a pin. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>A lot of people who struggle with mental health issues, suffer in silence. Why is that? I think one of the main reasons why people don't share how their feeling is the fear of judgement. Mental Health has a stigma around it. This stigma makes some people see individuals with mental illnesses as lazy, unmotivated, and unreliable. Often times when a person struggling confides in someone with a pre-determined judgment of mental health things like this are said.</p>
<p>""Snap out of it"" </p>
<p>""Other people have problems too""</p>
<p>""Let it go""</p>
<p>""Its all in your head"" </p>
<p>My personal favorite:<br/>""But you don't look like you're depressed""</p>
<p>It can be hard to know who is going to say something like that and who is not. With these pins people who are struggling and need someone to talk to will see that you are there for them. They may not come up to talk to you but its all about feeling noticed and understood. Its extremely important.</p>
<p>With your purchase of a pin or donation you are helping me help others. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I believe one huge challenge that I will have to overcome is getting people to know that my business exists. I plan to post on social media and talk to my peers to help me reach as many people as possible. </p>

<h3>Here's how you can help:</h3>
</div></div><p>We know $30,000 is a lofty goal.  To a small nonprofit like ArtServe, $30,000 is a ton of money that goes a long way.  In fact, it’s just about 25% of our fundraising goal for the entire fiscal year—and in these divided times, our community needs a space to gather and access creative work by #artivists who care deeply about our future.</p><p><strong>We need to #OpenTheBlackBox now to build bridges to peace, understanding and transformative action.  </strong></p><p>It's probably obvious that $30,000 won't be enough to fully create the black box theater we have in mind.  That's why we have $100,000 in grant funding pending to help cover the total renovation cost of $130,000. <strong> If we can raise $30,000 and add it to $100,000 in grant funds, we can open the theater by late spring of 2020. </strong> We also know that our fundraising success will inspire even more gifts from major donors, foundations and grant agencies that will allow us to successfully operate the space for years to come.  That’s why raising this money is such a big deal.</p><p><strong>Because socially conscious art impacts the lives so many artists and community members committed to creative change, we decided to launch our #OpenTheBlackBox Campaign.</strong></p><p>Here's how we'll use the money we raise:</p><ul>
<li>$30,000 from the <strong>#OpenTheBlackBox Campaign</strong> covers the cost of flooring upgrades and theater drapery</li>
<li>$50,000 from grant funding covers the cost of theater lighting</li>
<li>$50,000 from grant funding covers the cost of riser seating accommodating 150 audience members</li>
</ul><p> </p><p>Any additional funding raised from all sources will be used to:</p><ul>
<li>Improve the theater sound system</li>
<li>Improve backstage accommodations for performers</li>

</ul><p> </p><p>Our vision at ArtServe is that communities are stronger, made more whole, when we invest in safe space and creative models that cultivate self expression, courageous conversation and empathy.  By helping to <strong>#OpenTheBlackBox</strong>, you create a place where people—regardless of race, ethnicity, age, socioeconomic status, sexual orientation, gender identity or geographic location—feel valued and supported in breaking cycles of ignorance.</p><p><strong>By equipping #artivists with the space needed to engage with audiences, you magnify opportunities for us to collectively choose kindness over hate.</strong></p><p>As our Executive Director, Craig W.

</ul></div>","Here's where we're at:As one of the nation's original arts incubators, ArtServe has a 30-year history of developing artists and nonprofit organizations committed to strengthening our community through the arts.  Through this work, ArtServe has made it possible for the arts to thrive across South Florida, eagerly investing resources in the people—artists, staff and community stakeholders—who make art come alive.   Today, we annually support more than 2,000 artists and dozens of small nonprofits dedicated to making sure the arts continue to expand in our community.  ArtServe believes the way to do this is by cultivating a growing population of artists interested in reaching new audiences through creative initiatives that support diversity, equity, access and inclusion.Through poetry, dance, theater and more, these incredible artist activists—#artivists—are telling powerful stories and sharing new insights about real world issues, from immigrant experiences to environmental crises.  They use the arts to open a new line of communication between audiences from vastly different backgrounds, cultivating a renewed sense of understanding and compassion that's needed to make real progress as a global community. By supporting #artivists, we do right by us all.  ArtServe needs to invest in a black box theater space where socially engaged artists can present ground-breaking works that tackle issues including economic inequality, systemic racism, socio-political upheaval, indigenous incarceration, and other contemporary social justice issues. Here's where we're going:Imagine a rap opera connecting the history of slavery to modern-day systemic injustice.Or, a theatrical performance about a family's journey to care for an adult child with autism.Or, a spoken word performance about the impact of war on Syrian refugees. To bring these to life, we're going to transform a basic auditorium space, already in place in the ArtServe building, into a modern black box theater — a wide-open, participatory space where experimental art and social impact collide. Relying once again on your imagination, see this auditorium space:Becoming this black box theater, generously rendered for us by artist Moshé. Y:In this space, we'll be able to welcome audiences of all backgrounds and abilities to experience works by similarly diverse artists that:
Provide new insight into current events that lead to meaningful dialogue
Foster the expression of feelings, ideas and constructive action to improve our world
Validate underrepresented populations, highlighting their place, impact and value in a community
Deepen investments in education, community and self-growth to effectively disrupt the cycle of inequity
 And you don't just have to imagine it.  Here are samples of the kinds of works that will appear in the black box theater at ArtServe:New City Players will present theatrical works that challenge racism and inequity.Performers like Darius V. Daughtry will showcase poetic works that heighten social consciousness.
Artists like Alexander Grindle-Boettcher will share intimate talks that provide insight into the experiences of the transgender community.

 
And so many other #artivists will take center stage in the black box theater to awaken and inspire courageous conversations through the arts.  They are the conversations that must be had to fully understand our cultural identity and collective responsibility to making the world a better place.
Please join us now in our commitment to #OpenTheBlackBox.

I never thought that the goal would be reached so soon! I am so overwhelmed by your generous contributions and support.

The campaign was set up to last until December 17th. There are many great (postcards, prints, Mystery Perks, my book) still available. Please continue to spread the word about Common Ground as every little bit helps this project happen!

What is the project?

I will be documenting the everyday rituals (preparing and eating of meals, leisure time/story telling, morning routines, bedtime, etc...) of rural Kenyan families. during the months of February, March, and April of 2012. I will investigate parallels between Kenyan culture and supposedly disparate cultures such as my own.

Check out the Pitch Video is you haven't already!
 
Who am I?
 
I am a video artist exploring family, gesture, and space through experimental documentary methods. I started investigating family and culture in my work through personal experience. I'm an adult adoptee, and almost eight years ago, I met my biological family. This connection pushed me to examine kin relationships: looking at cultural similarities and differences, deciphering how I fit into each of my families (both biological and adopted), and how my newly contacted biological family fit into mine. Consequently, I experiment with visual material, exploring cultural parallels and the creative function of difference. I blend art and anthropology by deconstructing my documentary footage, separating and then reconfiguring the individual elements in the imagery - communicating my subjective perception, while remaining true to the context.

</h3>I'm Stephanie Avery, a Toronto-based artist and finder of amazing things. As an occasional purveyor of crafts, my world was shattered when
 I found the 1975/76 Greystone Encyclopedia of Crafts, abandoned and unwanted, on
 the front lawn of its previous owner’s home. I rescued the 
Encyclopedia from its despair and we became fast friends. Since that day
 my mind has been opened to the universe of crafts. <br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/230048/files/20131128154322-zacandcrafts.jpg?1385682202"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Twenty-four volumes of your favorite (relatively) obsolete crafts from the 
1970s, The Greystone Encyclopedia of Crafts is amazing. From abalone shells to zoetropes to everything in between, and 
in no particular order, this encyclopedia has every traditional craft 
you could ever hope to learn (and more than a few that would make most 
sane people run away screaming).<br/><br/>Over the years I've used the encyclopedia to guide my way through various practical and artistic projects (curtains! upholstery! Nintendo hook rugs!). Still, I don't feel like I've used it to the fullest extent of its capabilities. That's all about to change. <br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/230047/files/20131128154110-MegaMan.jpg?1385682070"" src="""" style=""""/></p>This winter I'm going to go through the encyclopedia and systematically completing as many crafts as time will allow. The process will be documented online at <a href=""http://beforeandcrafter.ca/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">beforeandcrafter.ca</a>, and will yield one-of-a-kind beautifully crafted works, as well as 
some fabulous monstrosities. The process is going to be an exercise in learning, creativity, and sanity. <br/><br/>Come spring every piece I make will go up 
for auction with (hopefully) 100% of the proceeds going to <a href=""http://sketch.ca/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">SKETCH</a>, a fantastic local organization. Among other things, SKETCH creates opportunities for young people who are street involved, 
homeless or otherwise on the margins, to experience the transformative 
power of the arts; to build leadership and economic self-sufficiency in 
the arts; and to cultivate social and environmental change through the 
arts. SKETCH is awesome, they do so much good work, and I want to give them money. <br/><p></p><p></p><h3>How You Can Help</h3><p>Before &amp; Crafter is going to get expensive. I'm going to have to buy a ton of supplies and material, plus rent equipment, plus get memberships to specialized DIY spaces, plus get some tech stuff to properly document everything, plus transportation to get it all (somehow I don't think my bicycle will cut it when I need, for example, bricks for a backyard kiln). <br/></p><p>I am but a mere artist with rent to pay and a tummy to fill. Before &amp; Crafter is happening no matter what but at the end of the day I would much rather see the auction proceeds go to SKETCH than to reimbursing myself for the cost of the project. That's where you come in, dear internet. With your help I can bring this project to life in the most beneficial way possible. Contributing to Before &amp; Crafter is like hitting two needy birds with one donation stone - you get to help an artist create new work AND you contribute to a fantastic organization.  <br/></p><p></p><h3>Perks!</h3>On top of the karma points you'll get from helping Before &amp; Crafter you'll also get some fun gifts from me. Depending on what you pitch in you could receive the following: <br/><p></p><p><b>Decoupage Postcards!</b></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/230267/files/20131128195108-love_phaser.jpg?1385697068"" src="""" style=""""/></p>If you're contributing $15 or more you'll be getting a heartfelt, handwritten thank-you card. But not just any card, goodness no. You'll receive a print of a decoupage postcard made by yours truly. If you're contributing $25 or more you'll also get a blank postcard to do with as you please. You can see most of them <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/mrscaptainmonkeypants/sets/72157638163558766/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a>. If you ask really nicely, depending on what I have available (almost all of them), I might even accept requests. <b><br/></b><p></p><p><b>Stickers! </b></p><p></p><p><b></b></p><p><b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/230332/files/20131128211157-stickers.jpg?1385701917"" src="""" style=""""/></b></p>Sometimes I love to put on a bad movie and make a ton of adorable stickers. I like to give them as gifts or decorate places that are in need of cheer. If you contribute $25 or more you'll get a baggie of at least 10 delightful hand-made stickers. <p></p><p><b>Perler Ornament/Necklace</b></p><p><b></b></p><p></p><p><b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/230358/files/20131128213755-perler.jpg?1385703475"" src="""" style=""""/></b></p><p></p><p></p><p>If you were a child in the eighties you almost certainly went to a birthday party where all the kids got to make their own Perler bead crafts. If you didn't get to experience this joy, well, you were probably better off not playing with ear canal/nostril-sized beads that needed to be melted with a blazing hot iron. Amazingly Perler beads are still around. <br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/230387/files/20131128221215-perler2.jpg?1385705535"" src="""" style=""""/></p>By now you may have noticed the connection between pixels and crafts, a connection I have utilized to the utmost nerdiness. And will do so again throughout Before &amp; Crafter, as well as in the very near future while making new Perler ornaments/necklaces for you!

Before & Crafter in Detail
I'm Stephanie Avery, a Toronto-based artist and finder of amazing things. As an occasional purveyor of crafts, my world was shattered when
 I found the 1975/76 Greystone Encyclopedia of Crafts, abandoned and unwanted, on
 the front lawn of its previous owner’s home. I rescued the 
Encyclopedia from its despair and we became fast friends. Since that day
 my mind has been opened to the universe of crafts. Twenty-four volumes of your favorite (relatively) obsolete crafts from the 
1970s, The Greystone Encyclopedia of Crafts is amazing. From abalone shells to zoetropes to everything in between, and 
in no particular order, this encyclopedia has every traditional craft 
you could ever hope to learn (and more than a few that would make most 
sane people run away screaming).Over the years I've used the encyclopedia to guide my way through various practical and artistic projects (curtains! upholstery! Nintendo hook rugs!). Still, I don't feel like I've used it to the fullest extent of its capabilities. That's all about to change. This winter I'm going to go through the encyclopedia and systematically completing as many crafts as time will allow. The process will be documented online at beforeandcrafter.ca, and will yield one-of-a-kind beautifully crafted works, as well as 
some fabulous monstrosities. The process is going to be an exercise in learning, creativity, and sanity. Come spring every piece I make will go up 
for auction with (hopefully) 100% of the proceeds going to SKETCH, a fantastic local organization. Among other things, SKETCH creates opportunities for young people who are street involved, 
homeless or otherwise on the margins, to experience the transformative 
power of the arts; to build leadership and economic self-sufficiency in 
the arts; and to cultivate social and environmental change through the 
arts. SKETCH is awesome, they do so much good work, and I want to give them money. How You Can HelpBefore & Crafter is going to get expensive. I'm going to have to buy a ton of supplies and material, plus rent equipment, plus get memberships to specialized DIY spaces, plus get some tech stuff to properly document everything, plus transportation to get it all (somehow I don't think my bicycle will cut it when I need, for example, bricks for a backyard kiln). I am but a mere artist with rent to pay and a tummy to fill. Before & Crafter is happening no matter what but at the end of the day I would much rather see the auction proceeds go to SKETCH than to reimbursing myself for the cost of the project. That's where you come in, dear internet. With your help I can bring this project to life in the most beneficial way possible. Contributing to Before & Crafter is like hitting two needy birds with one donation stone - you get to help an artist create new work AND you contribute to a fantastic organization.  Perks!On top of the karma points you'll get from helping Before & Crafter you'll also get some fun gifts from me. Depending on what you pitch in you could receive the following: Decoupage Postcards!If you're contributing $15 or more you'll be getting a heartfelt, handwritten thank-you card. But not just any card, goodness no. You'll receive a print of a decoupage postcard made by yours truly. If you're contributing $25 or more you'll also get a blank postcard to do with as you please. You can see most of them here. If you ask really nicely, depending on what I have available (almost all of them), I might even accept requests. Stickers! Sometimes I love to put on a bad movie and make a ton of adorable stickers. I like to give them as gifts or decorate places that are in need of cheer. If you contribute $25 or more you'll get a baggie of at least 10 delightful hand-made stickers. Perler Ornament/NecklaceIf you were a child in the eighties you almost certainly went to a birthday party where all the kids got to make their own Perler bead crafts. If you didn't get to experience this joy, well, you were probably better off not playing with ear canal/nostril-sized beads that needed to be melted with a blazing hot iron. Amazingly Perler beads are still around. By now you may have noticed the connection between pixels and crafts, a connection I have utilized to the utmost nerdiness. And will do so again throughout Before & Crafter, as well as in the very near future while making new Perler ornaments/necklaces for you! Anyone who contributes $50 or more will get their very own NES Perler piece. With Christmas coming I thought it would be nice to offer the option of tree ornament or necklace. Christmas will come and go before this campaign is over but if you get the $50 perk by December 17 I will try my darndest to ensure your gift arrives by Christmas. If you get this perk after December 17, fear not, there's always next year.    Portrait Finger Puppets!I am pretty excited to be personalizing one of the actual crafts from the encyclopedia. Friends, if you bid $100 or more you get your very own portrait finger puppet. It can be of anyone you want. Yourself, your kid, your childhood pet, Ryan Gosling, anyone! Think of the hi-jinx you and your finger puppet will have! What tremendous fun! These are going to be a tad time consuming so this package will almost certainly not make it to you for Christmas. Expect it in January or February. Paper-Making Class!Feel like you can only get so far learning crafts from an encyclopedia?

<p>This is a great chance to support ""Tonetta"" and allow him 6 months of freedom to dedicate to his art.</p>
<p>Tony isn't sure how he's going to pay the rent for the next 6 Months and is looking for some stability while he approaches 65 in February and will be able to collect on retirement.<br/><br/>My Name is Ryan (Roanoke, Virginia) and I've spent hours upon hours on the phone with Tony about how he makes his songs and about everything else you can think of. Many of our conversations revolve around how financially restrained he is and as a result his creative output is often compromised.</p>
<p>I told Tony about IndieGoGo and we discussed what he would need in order to be covered for 6 months. His rent is ""aboot 700 bucks a month, eh"" and 300 bucks a month would allow him to have internet access at his house and he wouldn't have to worry about every dollar he spends on art supplies, shipping costs, etc.</p>
<p>He's too busy to learn the ins and outs of computers and this website to set things up himself.  Tony doesn't even have a bank account.  Money will be sent directly to him via Western Union at the completion of the campaign and once funds have been delivered  Once Indiegogo and the Taxman have been paid for all of the rest goes to Tony himself.</p>

<h3>What Tonetta Needs &amp; What You Get</h3>

<p>$6000 will cover 6 months of the rent and other living expenses.</p>

<p>$100 will get you original art from Tony Jeffrey.<br/>*UPDATE* 5 more drawings are being released as the first 10 have sold out.<br/><br/> Many of these drawings have been on Tony's walls for more than a decade and are very precious to him.

<p>If the 6000 dollar goal is not reached then what funds are generated will still be a significant help in enabling Tony to create more work.  IndieGoGo charges 9% of the generated funds for campaigns that do not reach their goals; 4% if the goal is reached.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Deep Impact</h3>
<p>Tony is nearly 65 years old and has been dedicated to making his music, videos, and drawings long before many of his fans were even born.  His work has enhanced the lives of thousands of people, like me, feel he is a true inspiration and creative genius.</p>

Sometimes it takes another's perspective to change our own vision of ourselves and to lift us up.  We strive to empower the women and children at New Beginnings Womens Treatment and Rehabilitation Center by depicting their images in uplifting mural work and portraiture.  We will create portraits of them that they will then keep as their own in addition to portraying their images on beautiful murals throughout the center.  The goal: to capture their true essence, their weaknesses and their strengths, and to bring their images together in harmony to lift them up together. </p>
<p>Each woman will also be profiled in a short video, between 1 and 2 minutes in length, showing her in her strength and telling her story. Another video will be made, featuring the center itself. The videos will be shot with an eye for beauty, and the stories will be told honestly, hopefully in a way that informs and inspires.</p>
<p>The center will be able to use these videos in fundraising programs or just to share the work they do with anyone who might be interested. The goal is to make these videos powerful enough to stand alone as uplifting and engaging web content.</p>
<h3>Why Vicente Guerrero? </h3>
<p>We felt called to Vicente Guerrero to help a friend who is dedicating her time and energy to building something from nothing to bolster a community and spread hope and love.  Karly Dallas is responsible for creating and managing Oasis, an after school center for the children of Vicente Guerrero.  We completed extensive mural work and documented and spread the word about Oasis through film last year.  The experience was uplifting and grounding.  Art has transformative power in any location and situation, but Vicente Guerrero holds a special place in our hearts and beckons us back.</p><p>

<h4>Lindsay Carron</h4>
<p>Through an insatiable need for adventure, Lindsay Carron has been inspired to use art to bridge cultural gaps, raise questions, and communicate.  Her inspiration is sourced from observing behavior patterns in the daily life of humans and comparing it to those witnessed in animals in natural environments.  Instinct, adaptation, and socialization manifest in the ability for animals…and humans… to survive.  Yet endangerment, habitat loss, extinction…war… act strictly against the natural tendency to live.  What does it take for these two groups of life forms, animals and humans, to truly <em>thrive?</em>  The artist utilizes ballpoint pen to render invigorating life-size depictions of the beautiful creatures of our earth.  Lindsay is an art activist working in Los Angeles, California and traversing the globe bringing animal (and human) rights issues to the forefront through her energetic and passionate art.</p>
<p><a href=""http://lindsaycarron.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">lindsaycarron.com</a></p>
<h4>Courtney Belle Branch</h4>
<p>As an artist and entrepreneur, Courtney splits her time between building a holistic and expressive arts center in Winston-Salem, North Carolina while developing her career as an artist. She is a yoga practitioner moving towards work in art therapy. Her role in the healing arts has transformed the way she sees art's role in society and believes it is a strong modality for empowerment and healing. As an artist, she is fascinated by the human condition and the truths that we seek and conceive. Through her use of multiple mediums such as oil pastels, charcoal, and paints she blends words and nature to encourage one to find their own truth and growth. More importantly, she has seen a need to help in places where there is poverty, inequality, racism, and injustice. “It is a mission of mine to utilize the talents I have been given to help others. I wish to do this through any medium presenting itself.”</p>

</p><h4>Stan Parker</h4>
<p>Stan's mission, in four words, is to <em>tell stories that matter.</em> Stories have the power to illuminate, to inspire, to inform. They question our current course and offer new perspectives. At least, when they're done right. Whether by words, pictures, or video, journalism is the profession where Stan makes his home. It seems the perfect place for a digital jack-of-most-trades, hungry to explore the world, to tell stories worth sharing, and hopefully leave things better than he found them. Stan lives in Billings, Montana, and received his bachelor's degree in Journalism and Spanish from Pepperdine University.</p>

<h3>What We Are Going To Do Differently This Year!</h3>
<p>This year our team will be revisiting Oasis and the precious children there, but also expanding our outreach to New Beginnings Women’s Association.  This Vicente Guerrero rehabilitation center welcomes in women with abusive or troublesome pasts to a safe haven where they are provided with food, clothing, and a place to call home.  They are taught literacy, life skills, receive training for jobs, and are helped in furthering their education so they can become productive and valued members of society.  We are excited to further their work and support them with film and art.  We plan to build relationships with the women and children, fostering an excitement about art and creativity, and share their stories through film, word and portraiture. We hope that their stories can then serve as inspiration for countless women and children around the world. </p>

We have all witnessed our times of strength and our times of weakness.  Sometimes it takes another's perspective to change our own vision of ourselves and to lift us up.  We strive to empower the women and children at New Beginnings Womens Treatment and Rehabilitation Center by depicting their images in uplifting mural work and portraiture.  We will create portraits of them that they will then keep as their own in addition to portraying their images on beautiful murals throughout the center.  The goal: to capture their true essence, their weaknesses and their strengths, and to bring their images together in harmony to lift them up together. 
Each woman will also be profiled in a short video, between 1 and 2 minutes in length, showing her in her strength and telling her story. Another video will be made, featuring the center itself. The videos will be shot with an eye for beauty, and the stories will be told honestly, hopefully in a way that informs and inspires.
The center will be able to use these videos in fundraising programs or just to share the work they do with anyone who might be interested. The goal is to make these videos powerful enough to stand alone as uplifting and engaging web content.
Why Vicente Guerrero? 
We felt called to Vicente Guerrero to help a friend who is dedicating her time and energy to building something from nothing to bolster a community and spread hope and love.  Karly Dallas is responsible for creating and managing Oasis, an after school center for the children of Vicente Guerrero.  We completed extensive mural work and documented and spread the word about Oasis through film last year.  The experience was uplifting and grounding.  Art has transformative power in any location and situation, but Vicente Guerrero holds a special place in our hearts and beckons us back.

Who Are We?
Lindsay Carron
Through an insatiable need for adventure, Lindsay Carron has been inspired to use art to bridge cultural gaps, raise questions, and communicate.  Her inspiration is sourced from observing behavior patterns in the daily life of humans and comparing it to those witnessed in animals in natural environments.  Instinct, adaptation, and socialization manifest in the ability for animals…and humans… to survive.  Yet endangerment, habitat loss, extinction…war… act strictly against the natural tendency to live.  What does it take for these two groups of life forms, animals and humans, to truly thrive?  The artist utilizes ballpoint pen to render invigorating life-size depictions of the beautiful creatures of our earth.  Lindsay is an art activist working in Los Angeles, California and traversing the globe bringing animal (and human) rights issues to the forefront through her energetic and passionate art.

Courtney Belle Branch
As an artist and entrepreneur, Courtney splits her time between building a holistic and expressive arts center in Winston-Salem, North Carolina while developing her career as an artist. She is a yoga practitioner moving towards work in art therapy. Her role in the healing arts has transformed the way she sees art's role in society and believes it is a strong modality for empowerment and healing. As an artist, she is fascinated by the human condition and the truths that we seek and conceive. Through her use of multiple mediums such as oil pastels, charcoal, and paints she blends words and nature to encourage one to find their own truth and growth. More importantly, she has seen a need to help in places where there is poverty, inequality, racism, and injustice. “It is a mission of mine to utilize the talents I have been given to help others. I wish to do this through any medium presenting itself.”

Stan Parker
Stan's mission, in four words, is to tell stories that matter. Stories have the power to illuminate, to inspire, to inform. They question our current course and offer new perspectives. At least, when they're done right. Whether by words, pictures, or video, journalism is the profession where Stan makes his home. It seems the perfect place for a digital jack-of-most-trades, hungry to explore the world, to tell stories worth sharing, and hopefully leave things better than he found them. Stan lives in Billings, Montana, and received his bachelor's degree in Journalism and Spanish from Pepperdine University.

What We Are Going To Do Differently This Year!
This year our team will be revisiting Oasis and the precious children there, but also expanding our outreach to New Beginnings Women’s Association.  This Vicente Guerrero rehabilitation center welcomes in women with abusive or troublesome pasts to a safe haven where they are provided with food, clothing, and a place to call home.  They are taught literacy, life skills, receive training for jobs, and are helped in furthering their education so they can become productive and valued members of society.  We are excited to further their work and support them with film and art.  We plan to build relationships with the women and children, fostering an excitement about art and creativity, and share their stories through film, word and portraiture. We hope that their stories can then serve as inspiration for countless women and children around the world.

off-road for too long now, 4 years in fact. I initially converted my
truck, a 1978 Ford A Series, into a living space and giant camera as
a means to live independently as an artist, travel and share the
wonders of pinhole photography. The start-up period went well but we
soon encountered difficulties, firstly with the Low Emission Zone and
secondly with an accident. My life and work is very much London based yet the practicalities became over-complicated and my freedom to roam completely hindered.<br/><br/></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><blockquote>

<p>...I'd been on brink of selling up and putting an end to this particular creative endeavour but instead found myself fully re-awakening to the potential in pursuing this special project and just how much I've already invested in getting ETC this far. The worst of the accident damage was repaired after our accident in 2009 but I ran out of steam to fully re-instate ETC back on the road again. This is what I'd now like your help in doing and in the process create a body of exquisite art work to offer in return to those of you who can help make this happen. Yes, it can be argued that selling up and starting again is a sensible option but I know Eileen, who was a mobile canteen for the West Sussex Fire Service for 25 years, is truly one of a kind now and it seems wholly appropriate for me to accomplish what I originally set out to achieve; On The Road Again making unique art locally, nationally and globally too...</p>

will take us far and hopefully for me one day on to a Master's
degree in photography. In the first instance though, I'd like to complete the

Thank you!Eileen will be gleaming again very soon indeed...something along these lines......and depending on what the next 24 hours has in store, even better I hope! The above photo was taken in 2007 and is ETC in her former glory, which is far from the current state of affairs. The hole you see to the right of the silver square, which is the old serving hatch from her time as a fire service canteen, is the aperture for taking photographs...I'd like more of these one days so as to increase my perspective.With the funds raised so far, I can definitely overhaul the mechanics and body work, although the body work will probably require further time and investment and get back on the road again. As for the more exuberant items and actions on my wish list, they will have to wait...unless that is...by this time tomorrow I will know exactly what I have to work with and really start making plans.   An image of a very happy artist! Here's to keeping up the vanguard!On The Road Again...With the LEZ coupled with an accident, artist Karen Barnes' plans have been scuppered. Please help Eileen get back on the road again. The pinhole must go on.I'm a mixed-media artist who graduated from Goldsmith's College in 1999. The campaign avatar image was taken when Eileen and I were invited to the Tate Modern for a few days and our last night was spent inside the great Turbine Hall in 2007. 


 Eileen and I now.

Eileen The Cameravan (ETC) has been
off-road for too long now, 4 years in fact. I initially converted my
truck, a 1978 Ford A Series, into a living space and giant camera as
a means to live independently as an artist, travel and share the
wonders of pinhole photography. The start-up period went well but we
soon encountered difficulties, firstly with the Low Emission Zone and
secondly with an accident. My life and work is very much London based yet the practicalities became over-complicated and my freedom to roam completely hindered.

 A selection of positive pinhole photographs taken with Eileen at the Climate Camp Occupation of Blackheath in 2009.

...I'd been on brink of selling up and putting an end to this particular creative endeavour but instead found myself fully re-awakening to the potential in pursuing this special project and just how much I've already invested in getting ETC this far. The worst of the accident damage was repaired after our accident in 2009 but I ran out of steam to fully re-instate ETC back on the road again. This is what I'd now like your help in doing and in the process create a body of exquisite art work to offer in return to those of you who can help make this happen. Yes, it can be argued that selling up and starting again is a sensible option but I know Eileen, who was a mobile canteen for the West Sussex Fire Service for 25 years, is truly one of a kind now and it seems wholly appropriate for me to accomplish what I originally set out to achieve; On The Road Again making unique art locally, nationally and globally too...

ETC offers a plethora of creativity and
educational insight and a kick-start at this stage in our journey
will take us far and hopefully for me one day on to a Master's
degree in photography. In the first instance though, I'd like to complete the
pinhole excursions we've already embarked upon and carry out some exciting new
assignments in London and beyond. This will lead to an array of material including
photographic editions, publications, black and white prints, written
articles, music, film, interactive happenings, installations and education for those who would like to learn about camera obscuras and pinhole photography.

  The original prototypes for the Mini Eileen Flatpack Pinhole Cameravans designed by myself in 2009.





For future art, work and creative development to happen to its uppermost
standard we need to be fully mobile again with a reduction to carbon emissions, make interior and
exterior improvements to ETC and be well-equipped with photographic materials. This is what I'd like help in doing along with an estimate of costs:
Those marked with a * are what I can definitely achieve with the amount raised so far, currently £1525 with 23 hours remaining. It would be great to * some more and make even more improvements and creative leaps forward.


*£400   - ETC
is in good working order but has been SORN for four years. The back
brakes definitely need an overhaul and a thorough, general service is in order.
*£700   - Getting MOT'd, taxed and insured.
£3,500- Becoming LEZ compliant and better for the environment through the
fitting of a  filter to lower emissions.  
*£1,000- Exterior bodywork renovation. (as best as is possible with funds available)
£800   - Completing the wet corner by
installing a water system to facilitate the production of large-format prints                         
£500   - The addition of solar panels, which will provide greater flexibility when working.   
£200   - Fitting small, glass-plate negative
windows around the vehicle, bringing in more light and enhancing the camera theme.    £500  - Stocking up on kit, including large format photo trays and photographic paper ready to produce great work.
£1,000- Travelling around sharing the pinhole
experience, creating old and new art, teaching and inspiring.           
£100  - Being awarded a Showman's Licence and becoming fully professional in my practice and status.       
*£800-   Site fees. (currently lower as I'm nowhere near my target)

It is a lot of work to complete but it is my passion and the quality of art that is produced is second to none. Ever since I was a child, I've dreamt of embarking on a slow trip around the world and still would so love this to happen. The realm of experience and creative scope is thoroughly fantastic and the better equipped Eileen is, the greater the work produced will be.
If I don't meet my target of £9,500, I will have to forfeit the fitting of the filter and concentrate solely on mechanics, bodywork, paperwork and creativity. However, if we manage to raise beyond our target goal, I'll be able to improve ETC even more with the likes of a ceiling aperture, obscura trailer and up-to-date digital technology.

  Examples of my journals.



There are many ways you can help other than through financial donations such as the provision of parts and labour. I like to do as much of the maintenance work as I can and enjoy learning on the job, so perhaps you'd like to get your hands a bit dirty and join in the renovations. Furthermore, please help spread the word about this. There's more information about Eileen and I on the internet and I'll do my best to keep this all updated.

  Me inside Eileen.



It's not often that you come across something that is truly unique, yet Eileen is and the photographic experience we embody is bursting with potential, dreams and ambition.



 Me outside Eileen thinking about the future. Thank you for your time looking through our campaign, I hope you like what we have to offer.


Please tell your friends and family about On The Road Again and keep coming back for regular updates throughout and after the campaign's 40-day duration. Sign up to our various other sites as well for even more insights and our journey into the future too.

The pieces will be sold by silent auction throughout the exhibition. 40% of the profits of each piece will be compensated to the artist, and the remainder will be donated to the charity Shield of Athena, on top of funds raised among corporate sponsors and private donations during the campaign.The choice to involve Shield of Athena, Family Services, has been motivated by several factors. Firstly, a demonstrated professionalism; it is an organization dedicated to the protection of women and children’s rights with a reputation firmly established by years of activities and concrete achievements. Secondly, a compatibility of values; the association put a focus upon multiculturalism and shows a pronounced interest for art.Shield of Athena utilizes social workers, educators and cultural intermediaries who offer multidisciplinary, multilingual services to women and their children. The organization operates in the field among afflicted families in crisis, notably via its emergency shelter, and in the longer term through its legal clinic and support group. Shield of Athena’s latest project is to build a second-stage housing to give affordable alternative living space to the mother and her children once the need for the emergency shelter has passed. The geometric shape of the keyhole echoes this goal which is to open the door upon a brighter future for the rescued families.Participation in, “Behind Closed Doors,” and its support of Shield of Athena, aims to help women and children at their most vulnerable to break the vicious cycle of violence and abuse, and avoid its reiteration.Key elements to the success of this project, which are on par with the artistic aspect, will be the supporters and contributors who all working together, can make an impact upon the lives of those Shield of Athena represents.To help finance the various stages of the project, we are trying to appeal to the generosity of potential private contributors who have an interest in the development of local art. The money raised will fund logistics (raw materials, transport, set up of the exhibition), communication campaign (printing, graphic design) and event planning (location rental, catering, and entertainment).“Behind Closed Doors,” is an opportunity to indulge in the glorious creativity of many of Quebec's finest artists through their particular vision, and to do real lasting good for families that need aid, guidance and support in the greater Montreal area. Aperçu des récompenses // Insight of the rewards:

Synagogues in the Western Hemisphere are located
in the Caribbean? Neither did I, until I stumbled upon Mikvé Israel-Emanuel
in Curaçao while on assignment for the New York Times in 2009.</p><p>Sadly, these remarkable
historic sites are now in peril due to dwindling congregations, vandalism,
and natural disasters. After photographing the remnants of the Port-au-Prince Cathedral brought to ruins by
the earthquake in Haiti, I
realized how important it is to photographically
document these magnificent monuments.</p><p>After five years, I’ve
completed the only existing comprehensive
collection of fine art documentary photographs of all the oldest Jewish Synagogues and cemeteries in the Western Hemisphere, located in the Caribbean. These images highlight the
significant yet
little-known legacy of Judaism in
the New World.</p><p>My intention for this book and traveling exhibition is to raise
awareness of the urgent need
to preserve and protect these historical
treasures.</p><p>The thing is…unless
these photographs are published, exhibited, and seen worldwide, they are just
good photographs. But they don’t make a difference.</p><p>The good news is that a top-notch publisher wants to publish this book, plus the first exhibition is scheduled to open on March 20th in Houston, Texas. This exhibition has been organized and curated by Joan Morgenstern, notable collector for the Museum of Fine Arts Houston. Photographs from each of my projects are already in their permanent collection.</p><p>This exhibition is crucial because it takes place during the biennial <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/681649/www.fotofest.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""www.fotofest.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">FotoFest</a> festival and it will be seen by numerous curators, gallerists, photo-editors, publishers, and art dealers who have the ability to bring it worldwide.</p><p>Despite this fantastic news, the challenging truth is that I can't
make this happen on my own. I've reached a point where I need a little help
from my friends.</p><p><i>Will you purchase a photograph and join me in bringing this little-known story to the
world?</i></p><p><br/><b></b></p><h3><b><b>PROJECT DESCRIPTION</b></b></h3><p></p><p>
</p><p></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">
</span></p><p></p><p>
</p><p><i>Jewish Treasures of The Caribbean </i>will take form as a book and traveling exhibition that photographically captures
the little-known history of the Sephardic Jews of the Caribbean, as seen through
the remaining historic sites in Barbados, Curaçao, Jamaica, Nevis, St. Croix, St.
Thomas, St. Maarten, St. Eustatius, and Suriname. These Jewish communities date
back to the early 1600’s and are home to the oldest synagogues and Jewish cemeteries
in the Western hemisphere. These modern day treasures beautifully exemplify the
strength of the Jewish people as well as the surprisingly diverse cultural history
of the Caribbean.</p><p>The goals of this book and traveling exhibition are to highlight this important history, to raise awareness of the need for preservation, and similarly to my past books find a way to raise money for this cause. </p><p>View the Photographs in the <a href=""http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/jewish-treasures-of-the-caribbean-exhibition/x/3610395?c=gallery"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">gallery</a></p><p>(Scroll all the way down to see visuals of the perks you can receive)</p><p><br/></p><p></p><h3><b>HISTORY OF JEWS IN THE CARIBBEAN</b></h3><p>Now facing extinction, the Sephardic Jewish communities of the Caribbean were once so strong and influential that they helped fuel the success of the American Revolution, and finance the first synagogues in the United States, located in New York City and Rhode Island. </p><p>In the 1600’s, the West Indies became a place of salvation for Sephardic Jews who had fled to Amsterdam after the Spanish and Portuguese Inquisitions. La Nación, as these Jews were called, were fundamental in shaping the early Caribbean economy through their unique knowledge of sugar cane cultivation, agriculture, and an expansive network of trade. Some Jews also joined the pirates controlling the Caribbean seas, and later became influential politicians, plantation landowners, and bankers to the American colonies. While creating financial success for the European powers, the Sephardic Jews managed to prosper and keep their culture, religion, and customs alive - which lead to the continuation and support of Judaism throughout the Americas.</p><br/><p></p><p></p><h3>WHY THIS PROJECT IS IMPORTANT</h3><p>Once home to thousands of Sephardic Jews, these historic communities are now facing extinction.

<p></p></div>","PLEASE VISIT WWW.JEWISHTREASURESOFTHECARIBBEAN.COM TO PRE-PURCHASE BOOKS + PHOTOGRAPHSQUICK OVERVIEWDid you know that the oldest Jewish
Synagogues in the Western Hemisphere are located
in the Caribbean? Neither did I, until I stumbled upon Mikvé Israel-Emanuel
in Curaçao while on assignment for the New York Times in 2009.Sadly, these remarkable
historic sites are now in peril due to dwindling congregations, vandalism,
and natural disasters. After photographing the remnants of the Port-au-Prince Cathedral brought to ruins by
the earthquake in Haiti, I
realized how important it is to photographically
document these magnificent monuments.After five years, I’ve
completed the only existing comprehensive
collection of fine art documentary photographs of all the oldest Jewish Synagogues and cemeteries in the Western Hemisphere, located in the Caribbean. These images highlight the
significant yet
little-known legacy of Judaism in
the New World.My intention for this book and traveling exhibition is to raise
awareness of the urgent need
to preserve and protect these historical
treasures.The thing is…unless
these photographs are published, exhibited, and seen worldwide, they are just
good photographs. But they don’t make a difference.The good news is that a top-notch publisher wants to publish this book, plus the first exhibition is scheduled to open on March 20th in Houston, Texas. This exhibition has been organized and curated by Joan Morgenstern, notable collector for the Museum of Fine Arts Houston. Photographs from each of my projects are already in their permanent collection.This exhibition is crucial because it takes place during the biennial FotoFest festival and it will be seen by numerous curators, gallerists, photo-editors, publishers, and art dealers who have the ability to bring it worldwide.Despite this fantastic news, the challenging truth is that I can't
make this happen on my own. I've reached a point where I need a little help
from my friends.Will you purchase a photograph and join me in bringing this little-known story to the
world?PROJECT DESCRIPTION




Jewish Treasures of The Caribbean will take form as a book and traveling exhibition that photographically captures
the little-known history of the Sephardic Jews of the Caribbean, as seen through
the remaining historic sites in Barbados, Curaçao, Jamaica, Nevis, St. Croix, St.
Thomas, St. Maarten, St. Eustatius, and Suriname. These Jewish communities date
back to the early 1600’s and are home to the oldest synagogues and Jewish cemeteries
in the Western hemisphere. These modern day treasures beautifully exemplify the
strength of the Jewish people as well as the surprisingly diverse cultural history
of the Caribbean.The goals of this book and traveling exhibition are to highlight this important history, to raise awareness of the need for preservation, and similarly to my past books find a way to raise money for this cause. View the Photographs in the gallery(Scroll all the way down to see visuals of the perks you can receive)HISTORY OF JEWS IN THE CARIBBEANNow facing extinction, the Sephardic Jewish communities of the Caribbean were once so strong and influential that they helped fuel the success of the American Revolution, and finance the first synagogues in the United States, located in New York City and Rhode Island. In the 1600’s, the West Indies became a place of salvation for Sephardic Jews who had fled to Amsterdam after the Spanish and Portuguese Inquisitions. La Nación, as these Jews were called, were fundamental in shaping the early Caribbean economy through their unique knowledge of sugar cane cultivation, agriculture, and an expansive network of trade. Some Jews also joined the pirates controlling the Caribbean seas, and later became influential politicians, plantation landowners, and bankers to the American colonies. While creating financial success for the European powers, the Sephardic Jews managed to prosper and keep their culture, religion, and customs alive - which lead to the continuation and support of Judaism throughout the Americas.WHY THIS PROJECT IS IMPORTANTOnce home to thousands of Sephardic Jews, these historic communities are now facing extinction. Only 5 synagogues remain and almost half of the original cemeteries and countless ornate gravestones are either falling apart, or have been lost to natural disasters, vandalism, pollution, and the elements of time. The few historic landmarks still in use are little known gems of the Caribbean and invaluable landmarks in the Jewish history of survival. Harry Ezratty, author of 500 Years In The Jewish Caribbean writes: “Having revisited many of these historic sites, it is certain that these unique monuments of the Jewish people are in peril.”This exhibition and future book are vital tools to document, highlight, and raise awareness of this important legacy of the first Jews in the Western Hemisphere, before it is too late.  As the communities dwindle to approximately 10% of their previous sizes, now is the time to put preservation practices in place so that these historic sites are protected and preserved. THE PURPOSE OF THIS FUNDRAISERMy ultimate goal is to raise enough funding to pay the production costs of both the traveling exhibition and the published book. My urgent goal though is to raise vital funding to cover the printing and framing costs of the exhibition which total $15,000.  The secondary goal is to cover the $30,000 cost to publish the book with an acclaimed publisher.After this three-month exhibition in Houston, the show is expected travel to various cities throughout the USA, Canada, Europe, and the Caribbean. HOW THE FUNDS WILL BE USED98% of the funds raised will directly pay for the costs of printing, framing, and shipping the 38 photographs in this exhibition so that it may open in Houston and later travel throughout the USA, Canada, Europe, and the Caribbean. Any additional funds raised will be put towards the cost of publishing the book. 2% of these funds will be donated to the American Sephardi Federation. CONTRIBUTIONS ARE TAX DEDUCTIBLEYour contribution is Tax Deductible and simultaneously supports The American Sephardi Federation, the official Fiscal Sponsor of this project.YOUR REWARDS + RECOGNITION Besides feeling happy for knowing that you were a part of the success of this project, this is a great opportunity to collect one of my Limited Edition signed photographs or a Limited Edition portfolio that captures this entire series.  PLUS: be recognized as a Patron of this and all future exhibitions of this project! Persons who contribute $1500 or higher will also receive the following recognition on the title card of One photograph in the exhibition: ""Generously Donated By ""Your Name"".The Limited Edition Portfolios and Photographs are ONLY available through this fundraiser and will NOT be available at this size or price in the future. NOTE: THERE ARE 3 DIFFERENT PORTFOLIOS OF 5 PHOTOGRAPHS EACH.

<p> </p>
<p><span>Step inside the Soundala and experience CYMATICS (visual presentation of sound on matter) in real time! Come visit the Lotus Flower Centerpiece, where lasers are being refracted through a clear water displaying complex patterns and tones. The Lotus Flower Display is fully interactive, where you can come and adjust the frequencies coming from the flower, play instruments hooked up to the flower and SEE how sound really affects the body.</span></p>
<p>We will be setting up microphones and instruments around the display for people to play, including tonal instruments such as crystal bowls and tuning forks, along with didgeridoos and drums. We encourage ALL participants to bring anything they would like to see affecting the display.</p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Objective:</span> To spread awareness of the effects of vibrations on the world around us and in ourselves, based off the science of Cymatics. Cymatics is the study of the visible manifestation of vibrations. When sound waves travel through matter, many interesting and beautiful patterns can be observed. These patterns take various different visual forms, from simple ripples to complex sacred geometric shapes that are repeated throughout the universe.</p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Vision:</span> To co-create a multi-sensory and healing experience of light, touch and sound through the vibrations of sound waves, by creating a connected collection of Cymatics-Driven art displays. This display attempts to deepen the understanding of how sound really affects the body. IT HAS REAL PHYSICAL CHANGES.</p>
<p><span>EVERYONE CAN PLAY!</span></p>
<p>We hope to bring a unique and interactive experience that encompasses and spreads knowledge from many different fields, ranging from scientific to spiritual, in an attempt to raise awareness that everything in our universe is ONE, everything is VIBRATION!</p>

But above all else, I AM SOUND. I am a walking symphony of harmonic vibration.  And so is everyone and everything else…</p>
<p>Five years ago, I discovered sound in a way that I have never experienced before and it transformed my life forever. I discovered the human body is an orchestra of sounds. Every energy center, every organ, every bone, every tissue, every cell, every DNA stran has its own resonant frequency, its own vibration and sound.  My spirit felt like it had awoken into a new world of infinite possibilities.  I knew in those moments, I truly was given a glimpse into the world that is vibrantly alive, interconnected, and constantly striving for harmony.   </p>

ONLY 20 HOURS LEFT TO CONTRIBUTE!!! TO Manifest this amazing peice, we need to raise $965!!!
 

 
Step inside the Soundala and experience CYMATICS (visual presentation of sound on matter) in real time! Come visit the Lotus Flower Centerpiece, where lasers are being refracted through a clear water displaying complex patterns and tones. The Lotus Flower Display is fully interactive, where you can come and adjust the frequencies coming from the flower, play instruments hooked up to the flower and SEE how sound really affects the body.
We will be setting up microphones and instruments around the display for people to play, including tonal instruments such as crystal bowls and tuning forks, along with didgeridoos and drums. We encourage ALL participants to bring anything they would like to see affecting the display.
Objective: To spread awareness of the effects of vibrations on the world around us and in ourselves, based off the science of Cymatics. Cymatics is the study of the visible manifestation of vibrations. When sound waves travel through matter, many interesting and beautiful patterns can be observed. These patterns take various different visual forms, from simple ripples to complex sacred geometric shapes that are repeated throughout the universe.
Vision: To co-create a multi-sensory and healing experience of light, touch and sound through the vibrations of sound waves, by creating a connected collection of Cymatics-Driven art displays. This display attempts to deepen the understanding of how sound really affects the body. IT HAS REAL PHYSICAL CHANGES.
EVERYONE CAN PLAY!
We hope to bring a unique and interactive experience that encompasses and spreads knowledge from many different fields, ranging from scientific to spiritual, in an attempt to raise awareness that everything in our universe is ONE, everything is VIBRATION!

The Purpose of this Project:
Along my life's journey, I have found that I can be considered many things: A friend, a daughter, a wife, a woman and beyond... But above all else, I AM SOUND. I am a walking symphony of harmonic vibration.  And so is everyone and everything else…
Five years ago, I discovered sound in a way that I have never experienced before and it transformed my life forever. I discovered the human body is an orchestra of sounds. Every energy center, every organ, every bone, every tissue, every cell, every DNA stran has its own resonant frequency, its own vibration and sound.  My spirit felt like it had awoken into a new world of infinite possibilities.  I knew in those moments, I truly was given a glimpse into the world that is vibrantly alive, interconnected, and constantly striving for harmony.   

The Soundala Temple structure will utilize cutting edge techniques employed in sound and resonance therapy, targeting the senses to promote the self to return to its optimal state of sonic balance. From this space of emotional receptivity, we are able to better access healthier choice discernment patterns, creative and imaginative thinking capacities, and objective experiential perspectives.  Creating new expansive pathways of life prospective can have dramatically positive effects on our sense of happiness and well-being.  This is the essence of Soundala Project: The development of a safe, healthy, and comfortable container that can help facilitate positive personal and community transformation.
Design Plans & Funding Resource Breakdown:
This portable 8-sided Octagon structure represents infinity and the rebirth of the self. The structure will be solely handcrafted and designed with sound acoustic technology. It will consist of poles and beams to create the shape that slot together using peg, post, and beam technique. The canvas for the top will be custom made. The roof will be made from Tipi-like material, a very strong material that will still allow airflow, protect from the elements, and can be painted to enhance aesthetics in the future.  The structure will be approximately 22 ft. in diameter, 6 ft. tall at the main entrance, with a maximum height of 10-12 ft. at its central apex.  We will use a CNC machine to make stylistic modifications on the archways and attaching arrowhead accents.  Additionally all wood with be clear coated and weather proofed and structurally double reinforced to ensure integrity in acclimate conditions.  
The sides of this structure will be able fold down and open up like a Lotus flower, revealing the inside of the Soundala. Airflow can be controlled by solar shades that will drop down from the sides. When the walls are open, the shades will maximize sound reduction and comfort levels as needed from the sun, wind and other elements.

The Greater Impact for our Community:
The Mandala is an ancient art form most recognized through its long storied use in Tibetan Buddhism.  The mandala is a Sanskrit word meaning “world in harmony.” In Tibetan Buddhism, a mandala is a symmetrical symbolic pattern that is contemplated on during meditation.  Every color, design, and object orientation in the mandala has great significance, representing an element of creation, an aspect of critical wisdom or some guiding principle in one’s quest to obtaining a harmonious lifestyle.  The Soundala Temple acts in similar capacities as the ancient mandala, using sound, resonance and vibration as catalysts for achieving balance of body, mind, and spirit for those who enter.
My intention is to create a portable structure that fuses together vast scientific knowledge of resonance healing with ancient architectural and creative techniques honored by some of our world’s most cherished spiritual traditions. With the help of veteran craftsman and artisan Joel Whittaker, we will create an octagon based sound therapy free-standing experiential mandala structure.  This geometric sound healing chamber will be hand crafted, complete with ornate visual artistry and will house a bevy of both traditional and modern resonance therapy tools to create the Soundala Temple; a mandala of symbiotic sound.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I've been in S. Africa exploring queer art in various forms for the last nine months. During that time I've been thinking about how my Chicago-based trio's work has evolved over the past two and a half years and where DoubleDJ fits in the larger global queer performance community. I found out about the International Federation for Theatre Research in Barcelona, Spain, and thought it to be a great platform to explore these themes. It takes place Juy 22-26, 2013, and the theme this year is Re-Routing Performance. I'll be giving a talk to the Queer Futures working group. Perfect!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I hope to raise at least $3000 for roundtrip airfare to Barcelona, Spain, and the cost of registration with the Cambridge Journal. There are great Perks to giving, such as: a digital copy of my abstract, a hard copy of my paper, postcard from Barcelona, DoubleDJ tshirt, walking lesson in stilettos &amp; more!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>In questioning what our queer performance is, we allow ourselves to constantly pull from our varied backgrounds (dance performance &amp; choreography, acting, physical theatre, directing, etc.) to add dimension and thoughtfulness to what we're communicating. I feel this is important in a scene with performance aesthetics that range from simple, uninspired and dull, to abstract, complex and ultimately universal.</p>

<p>And that’s all there is to it.</p></div>","Short Summary
I've been in S. Africa exploring queer art in various forms for the last nine months. During that time I've been thinking about how my Chicago-based trio's work has evolved over the past two and a half years and where DoubleDJ fits in the larger global queer performance community. I found out about the International Federation for Theatre Research in Barcelona, Spain, and thought it to be a great platform to explore these themes. It takes place Juy 22-26, 2013, and the theme this year is Re-Routing Performance. I'll be giving a talk to the Queer Futures working group. Perfect!


What I Need & What You Get
I hope to raise at least $3000 for roundtrip airfare to Barcelona, Spain, and the cost of registration with the Cambridge Journal. There are great Perks to giving, such as: a digital copy of my abstract, a hard copy of my paper, postcard from Barcelona, DoubleDJ tshirt, walking lesson in stilettos & more!


The Impact
In questioning what our queer performance is, we allow ourselves to constantly pull from our varied backgrounds (dance performance & choreography, acting, physical theatre, directing, etc.) to add dimension and thoughtfulness to what we're communicating. I feel this is important in a scene with performance aesthetics that range from simple, uninspired and dull, to abstract, complex and ultimately universal.


Other Ways You Can Help
If you're unable to give financially, please spread the word VIRALLY!

<p> The money raised will help pay for the Art Institute of California’s LA 2013 Summer Studio program which includes boarding, airfare, traveling expenses, food, and a small materials budget.</p>
<p><span>Here is a link if you wish to read about the program.  <a href=""http://summerstudio.com/LosAngeles/#experience"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>http://summerstudio.com/LosAngeles/#experience</span></a>         </span></p>
<p><strong>We would LOVE to see Izzy attend this program!!</strong></p>
<p><span>  Ever since Izzy was toddler I can remember her loving to sing, draw, paint, dance anything that would allow her to be creative. She has showed talent from an early age and has always held an unyielding passion for the arts.</span>She also writes and sings her own music which she had performed at local talent shows. She painted a large sports mural on a wall at her high school, she is part of the high school choir and yearbook. Izzy stays busy but will always find time to create, even though taking care of the animals and chores at her families ranch could be considered a full time job for most people her age. Izzy is extremely deserving of this opportunity and would be incredibly grateful to attend this program.My husband (Randsom Keith) and I both agree that Izzy has great potential in the arts. We can not allow her candle to be dimmed due to a lack of opportunity or funding in her community. She lives in a ultra rural area, so hitching a ride for the 2 hour commute to the nearest art store to get supplies seems impossible at times and sadly the arts are not considered a suitable and productive way of life.</p>
<p><span> Izzy inherited her talents from her Grandmother whom one could call a child prodigy in the height of the early 20th century California impressionism and plein air era that produced much of the great art of that century. Her Grandmother made a nobel decision to give up her dreams of painting in her late teens because she had thought working the land was her only path for the family. If only she had someone to encourage her and show her that her paintings could have provided a fulfilling way of life. </span></p>
<p><span><strong>Izzy works very hard and is extremely deserving of this!!</strong></span></p>

<p>Last summer I had the opportunity to visit the Pine Ridge Reservation with a group from Hot Metal Bridge Faith Community. We made some friends and one of them, Gerald Cournoyer visited Pittsburgh to do a lecture on Lakota art and culture.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This year we are going back to South Dakota with a group from Wallace Memorial Church. We are teaming up with Professor Cournoyer to facilitate a weeklong summer arts camp for grade school children. Gerald is teaching traditional Native American art making techniques, and I've put together five workshops:</p>

<p>Painting - Drip Painting</p>
<p>Drawing and Writing - Hand Made Journal</p>
<p>Sound - Hearing Your Own Voice / Field Recording</p>

If you don't know me, I'm a multi-media artist from Pittsburgh PA.  I love to teach, serve, learn, and connect.
 
Last summer I had the opportunity to visit the Pine Ridge Reservation with a group from Hot Metal Bridge Faith Community. We made some friends and one of them, Gerald Cournoyer visited Pittsburgh to do a lecture on Lakota art and culture.
 
This year we are going back to South Dakota with a group from Wallace Memorial Church. We are teaming up with Professor Cournoyer to facilitate a weeklong summer arts camp for grade school children. Gerald is teaching traditional Native American art making techniques, and I've put together five workshops:
 
Painting - Drip Painting
Drawing and Writing - Hand Made Journal
Sound - Hearing Your Own Voice / Field Recording
Photographic Process - Cyanotypes
Kites - Building and Flying!

</div></div>","Artists' Republic
Connecting Creatives: YOU are not alone in this world!

Imagine a social media platform custom designed for professional artists, designers, writers, musicians, dancers, architects, film-makers, curators, and other creatives.
Imagine connecting, communicating and working on a focused, flexible and responsive, hassle-free social-network; be captivated by functions and conveniences you've never dreamed possible.


Imagine a social-network built to help you meet the people who want to work with you, supporters who want to fund your project and the artists you are inspired by, together with all those who love your work and want to keep in touch with you.



You have the right to opportunity: it is there when you can connect with all those you couldn't even greet on the existing platforms; bring serendipity and luck to your side!



Welcome to the Artists' Republic!  


What do professional artists, architects, designers, musicians, dancers, performers or film makers want?

We want to make A LIVING from our art!
We want to practice our profession, bring our work as close to perfection as we can, and be paid for doing so.This is our dream. 

We want to change the world, but we cannot do it on our own; we need the help, support and the encouragement of our peers and friends to make our dreams come true. 

We want to connect with businesses wanting to provide us with services, opportunities and funding to grow and develop our art.

We want a platform where we can freely express our diversity and make our voices heard.

We want to connect with our audience and with each other.


There are so many social media sites already; do we need another one?


YES, professional artists DO!


I am glad there is a 'Facebook', a 'Linked In', a 'Twitter' and a 'YouTube' making available useful services for everybody, and insights into what works for artists and what doesn't.
The Artists' Republic will provide, under one umbrella, ALL the services artists need: from a continuously updating feed about what's new in the art world, to groups, discussions, curated galleries, portfolios, fundraising, blogs, journals, integration with other social media, and, last but not least, easy access and connection with other creatives and with your supporters and audience.
We are accountable to the select 1%, professional, creative, artist population of the world: our responsibility is quality and innovation. 
Artists are perfectionists; we are artists working for artists.

How is the Artists' Republic different? How is it better?
Functionality & Interface: innovative, different, better!
What I dislike the most, as a visual artist, is senseless, distracting (visual) noise. The flashing, confusing chaos of content mixed with advertising, with everything on screen screaming for attention... so tiring... so annoying...
Menus changing place from one window to the next are confusing, frustrating and disorienting.
The Artists' Republic reinvents, renews and revitalizes social media by restoring and rekindling the rejuvenating enjoyment the experience can carry.
The platform is highly functional and efficient while the interface is clean, elegant and consistent across the site, letting you focus on content.
Check it out!

'Discover' page featuring the newest visual arts projects.

The menu on the right hand side changes color from one artistic domain to the next, providing visual feed-back and orientation: the menu for 'Visual Arts' is green, while for 'Design' it is purple:
'Activity' page featuring the newest in automotive design.

Actionable items, such as 'appreciate', 'follow', 'connect' or 'comment' are context sensitive, and show up only when they make sense.

The interface plays second violin to content; YOUR WORK can be appreciated without interference or distraction; the interface stays the same, whether you are a visual artist:


Leslie Tucker's Project page with one of her latest works.

a musician:

A mock-up page for 'Gotan Project'.

 a fashion designer:

A mock-up page for fashion designer Alexander Mcqueen.


or a performance artist:

A mock-up page featuring performance artist Jack Smith.


Setting up a 'Portfolio' is easily done in only three steps: upload your work, write about it if you wish so and publish it to the 'New Projects' section. 
The tagging of your work is done right away as you select through the menus on the right hand side the categories it belongs to.
You can upload images, sound files and you can also embed videos of your work. 





This is the interface for setting up a new Project for my Portfolio.

This is the first page of my 'Portfolio'; please notice how the action menus on the right hand side change according to context:

Page 1 of my Portfolio.


You can easily post your comments at the bottom of any published project. If you prefer not to receive feedback on your work, you can turn comments OFF:

Can I connect with and update my other social-networks?
YES, and it's EASY!
You can easily post your projects to other social-media sites you are using; the tools are built into the interface, and are at hand, whenever you need them.

The social media bar.

How can I network on the Artists' Republic?
Through Groups, Forums, Discussions, Messaging & E-mail.
As a Citizen of the Republic you can start your own 'Groups' and 'Discussions'; you can become a member of groups set up by others, and participate in their discussions. 
You can message anybody following you; when you follow others you give them permission to message you. It is fully under your control who you are giving (or not) messaging privileges.
The Republic has very strict anti-spam and anti-bullying laws.

The page for starting a 'Group'


The page for starting a 'Discussion' within a 'Group'.


You can easily see the profile pages of all the users and search by name or by creative domain using the same menus as before. 
You can connect with anybody you wish by clicking on the '+follow' menu item on their 'Passport', 'Portfolio' or 'Project' page.

A mock-up page for visual artist Citizens.



How much does it cost?

Registering for an account is FREE!
The Artists' Republic will have three types of accounts:


A comprehensive and feature rich FREE account.
A Professional account.
A Corporate account.
Some artist want to have full control over the look and feel of the site where they are showing their work. 
The 'Professional' level membership gives them the power and the tools necessary to completely redesign the look of their domain within the Artists' Republic, to fully implement their unique vision. 
A Blog, a Journal and a Newsletter they can send their followers are also part of the 'Professional' package. 
The 'Corporate' account is for companies involved with the arts.
Both the 'Professional' and the 'Corporate' accounts are fee based accounts.




What happens with the information I give you?

Privacy: VERY STRICT LAWS!




The Republic has very strict privacy laws:  No data about you will EVER be sold to third parties.



Will you carry advertising?

Yes, however... :




Advertising within the Artists' Republic will be visible only in the 'Announcements' and in the 'Jobs' sections. 
Those interested in receiving advertising from Corporate Citizens of the Republic will have to consent to having ads sent to them directly.

Jobs postings in the Design section.



All the registered members will be able post their upcoming events and gallery openings, as well as deadline notices for residences, grants and scholarships, in the 'Announcements' section:

A mock-up 'Announcements' page.



How will you fund the Artists' Republic?

Five different ways:




The Artists' Republic will fund itself through:


Membership Fees for 'Professional' and 'Corporate' accounts.
Paid advertising in the 'Jobs' and 'Announcements' sections.
10% commission on sales made through the Artists' Republic network.
3% commission on projects funded through the Artists' Republic.
Donations.

All the registered members will be able post their upcoming events and gallery openings, as well as deadline notices for residences, grants and scholarships, in the 'Announcements' section:




What are the challenges you are facing?

Funding.




The main challenge the Republic is facing is having enough funds to deliver the quality services it set out to provide.
Building a quality product is expensive, and we have decided to approach the project in a step by step, modular fashion, introducing the core features and services first, then building on those as more funds become available.



How can I help?

Please invest in the Artists' Republic!




If you find this project useful and worthwhile, please invest in it as much as you can afford to.
We are aware it is those who would benefit the most from this platform who can afford the least to contribute financially; if you can't spend money on our project it is OK. Please spread the word about it through the means available on this site.

<h3><strong>Welcome to the Charity Shop</strong></h3>
<p>Hi. I'm Jordan Avila and I run the Charity Shop in Garden Grove. A nonprofit that supports arts education and functions as an after hours art collective. We are 1 month away from a total shutdown! We need your help to stay open and grow into the art monster we dream of being!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We, like most Americans, have bills to pay. And we are late! $4000 of the funds raised would pay overdue rent and utilities for our charity shop home. </p>
<p>The other $3000 you ask? Well why don't I blow your mind... </p>
<p>We are an art collective that seeks to create together and bring beauty and art to our community. We function as an artist/musician/film/fashion/talent haven! Our dream is to not only be a space where you can get stellar $2 vinyl or that weird cat statue your mom has only ever dreamed of, but also a place where we can invite our neighbors to learn/love/celebrate.</p>
<p>$100 would go to throwing a celebratory party, to thank you for supporting our dreams. This would be a combination of food, music, art, film, and beer. Details will come once we see the end is near!</p>
<p>$400 will go to much needed shop repairs and fixes. We want to become a space where people feel comfortable... like a second home where only weird artists reside.</p>
<p>$500 will go to art classes. This includes: supplies, advertising, teacher stipends, and anything else we need to make these classes free or next to free.</p>
<p>$500 will go to events! We do events every week and we want to improve the quality immensely. This includes: marketing events, food and beverages, and soundproofing the shop.</p>
<p>$600 will go to developing a work/study space for artists and local students. We want to provide a comfortable space for people to be productive. This includes: new furniture, better lighting, and equipment for making coffee and tea.</p>
<p>$400 will go to improving our event space and equipment. We often feature bands and would really like to improve the space so that we can attract local bands and be able to provide them with a better sound system and stage.</p>
<p>$500 will go to functioning as a financial safety net. Ideally the sales from the charity shop and ticket sales for larger events will pay our bills, but just in case we want to keep our doors open indefinitely.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>What Happens If We Aren't Fully Funded?</strong></h3>
<p><strong><br/></strong>If we aren't fully funded? We use the money we raised to pay outstanding rent and we try to keep going. But to really truly function as the organism we want to be we NEED this money. This is why we aren't just asking for money to pay our rent. We don't just want to be your average thrift shop, we want to expand our love and understanding of art and life and use it to better the community we live in. We have so much planned and it would be an injustice to lose hope because of an economic struggle.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Funding for the arts, let alone any extracuricular activities, has been devastated by our state's debt crisis. We don't want to just make art, we want to be and share art. We want students in high school and youth heading into college or the workforce to have access to the art education they want without having to pay the high prices you find most of these classes at in colleges. We want to foster their passion and curiosity while developing lasting relationships with them. Ultimately offering them a space that feels like a second home, where they can be themselves and have a space to express that visually.</p>
<p>Funding the Charity Shop is funding the arts!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Help spread the word. Save our Shop!</p>
<p>Contribute time: volunteer your time in the shop. Help us make it a better space and help us move heavy things.</p>
<p>Contribute your money: Come shop at our store!! We have so many items. We are a treasure hunt masquerading as a store. Come see all of the funky items we have ranging from vinyl to VHS to clothing to art to jewelry. Honestly we have it all.</p>
<p>Tell your friends about us! We need your support and your dollars to make this campaign a success.</p>
<p>Bring in your artists, bring in your bands, bring us your items you want to consign! Build our network!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Neil Ellis Orts is a writer and performer with a background in theater (BFA in Acting from Texas State University) and performance art (MA in Interdisciplinary Arts, Columbia College Chicago). Most of his performance work has been solo creations. </p>
<p>Despite being active in the performance community with other artists' and companies' work, his desire for creating larger-than-solo work has grown until he decided forming his own company was the only means for doing so. Breath &amp; Bone/Orts Performance is that company. </p>
<p>Part of what makes BB/OP unique is it's interdisciplinary approach to performance---it's not entirely theater, not exactly dance. The company will pursue work that might be presented on a stage or it might present a ""happening"" (like our ""Long Night/Joyous Light"" winter solstice happening this past December) and any possibility in between. <br/><br/>Another aspec that led Neil to start BB/OP is his bent towards the religious and spiritual. Theologically trained in Lutheran and Episcopalian traditions, his work often has a meditative quality, sometimes overtly relating to his religious faith, other times much less so. <br/><br/>ShadowPlace is a performance installation that will have no overt symbols tying it to any one religious tradition, but it is a meditation of moving light, shadow, and fabric. Viewers are invited to sit with it the entire hour or to come and go as they please, but it's presented as an invitation to consider the shadows---and the lights that throw them---in eveyone's life. </p>
<p><br/>In Houston, there are Christian theater and dance companies, but BB/OP is intended to be something a bit more on the edge of a religious audience. Neither adhering to strict doctrinal teachings nor coyly avoiding religious faith, we hope to offer a fresh voice to the choir of Houston arts organizations. </p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
Neil Ellis Orts is a writer and performer with a background in theater (BFA in Acting from Texas State University) and performance art (MA in Interdisciplinary Arts, Columbia College Chicago). Most of his performance work has been solo creations. 
Despite being active in the performance community with other artists' and companies' work, his desire for creating larger-than-solo work has grown until he decided forming his own company was the only means for doing so. Breath & Bone/Orts Performance is that company. 
Part of what makes BB/OP unique is it's interdisciplinary approach to performance---it's not entirely theater, not exactly dance. The company will pursue work that might be presented on a stage or it might present a ""happening"" (like our ""Long Night/Joyous Light"" winter solstice happening this past December) and any possibility in between. Another aspec that led Neil to start BB/OP is his bent towards the religious and spiritual. Theologically trained in Lutheran and Episcopalian traditions, his work often has a meditative quality, sometimes overtly relating to his religious faith, other times much less so. ShadowPlace is a performance installation that will have no overt symbols tying it to any one religious tradition, but it is a meditation of moving light, shadow, and fabric. Viewers are invited to sit with it the entire hour or to come and go as they please, but it's presented as an invitation to consider the shadows---and the lights that throw them---in eveyone's life. 
In Houston, there are Christian theater and dance companies, but BB/OP is intended to be something a bit more on the edge of a religious audience. Neither adhering to strict doctrinal teachings nor coyly avoiding religious faith, we hope to offer a fresh voice to the choir of Houston arts organizations.

<h3>Hi! I’m Rob Sacchetto and I am best known for drawing Zombies.</h3>
<p>Illustrating Zombies isn’t just my pastime or a hobby; it’s my job.</p>
<p>Since 2006 I’ve been drawing Zombies full-time as part of my custom portrait business, <a href=""http://www.zombieportraits.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.zombieportraits.com</a>. I’ve written and illustrated two published books on the subject of the living dead and, since 2009, I’ve drawn an original piece of Zombie themed art every single day as part of my ‘Zombie Daily’ blog.</p>
<p>So far, I’ve drawn and posted over 1500 Zombie themed illustrations on top of the thousands of zombie portraits I’ve created for clients.</p>
<p> I’ve been commissioned to create custom portraits and artwork for Chris Hardwick of The Talking Dead, Return of the Living Dead actor Brian Peck (Scuz), the Zombie Godfather himself George Romero, modern Zombie innovator Max Brooks as well as Walking Dead makeup maestro and director Greg Nicotero for the Zombie Documentary “Zombiemania”.</p>
<p><img alt=""Sample Portraits"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://zombieportraits.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/portraits.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Sample Zombie Portraits""/></p>
<p>The majority of my 'Zombie Daily' illustrations come from a variety of personal inspirations, and I now receive a number of requests from my Facebook followers. With overwhelming support and interest, I thought that maybe it’s time I let someone else dictate what Zombies I draw from day to day.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What is this campaign all about?</h3>
<p>So, here is the deal, for 365 days I’m going to let you, the zombie fans, tell me what you'd like me to draw and post on my 'Zombie Daily' blog.</p>
<p>On top of that, I intend to let those zombie fans <strong>KEEP</strong> the original illustrated requests that I draw! These are physical peices of art...made on paper...with pens and paint! </p>
<p>When contributing to this campaign, you will be allowed to submit a one sentence Zombie description, idea or theme. I will then sketch your request, post it on my blog with a link of your choice and then I will <strong>MAIL YOU THE ORIGINAL ARTWORK</strong>!</p>
<p>That's right! <em>Zombies in your mailbox</em>!</p>
<h3>From idea, to sketch to original zombie art in your hands!</h3>

<p>Want to see a Zombie clown?How about a Zombie riding a horse? How about a Zombie horse? How about a Zombie house? What about a Zombie pirate fighting a Zombie ninja?</p>
<p>Just contribute and submit your idea!</p>
<h3>Questions? I have answers!</h3>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> Can I send you my photo for a Zombie Portrait?</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> Nice try. No. My zombie portrait business is separate for this offer. If you would like a portrait, I would love to do one for you but please visit <a href=""http://www.zombieportraits.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.zombieportraits.com</a> and place and order. This campaign is for submitted ideas, descriptions and concepts ONLY!   </p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> So, what constitutes a sketch?</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> Sketches will, by default be in black and white. If the idea is really good, it might be a fully painted illustration. I can promise you will NOT get some quick pencil doodle in any case. These will all be little zombie masterpieces suitable for framing. </p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> Are these computer illustrations? </p>
<p>A. No way! I’m a traditional artist. I work in pens and paint. These are real world object suitible for framing. Not a complex series of ones and zeros. I am not computer literate. I have help with all my online stuff. In fact, I have a minion typing this right now.</p>
<p>Say ‘hello’ to the nice people, my minion.</p>
<p><em>…Hello… </em></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> So, how big are these sketches?</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> Paper costs money. Yes, I’m serious. Good paper is one of the biggest expenses involved in what I do. But, at a minimum these will be 6x4, (or thereabout), post card sized sketches and illustrations. Again, sometimes the zombie muse gnaws on my brain and your seed of inspiration may set of a chain of events that result in a full-scale finished work that is bigger.</p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> How long will you spend drawing these?</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> Probably a couple of hours, that's what I've allotted with the perk price. However, this is content I will be producing for use in my blog so it’s in my best interest to do the very best job I can. I may spend several hours on a specific project if the mood strikes me. Who knows? But again, I promise you won’t receive some sloppy sketch. I’m proud of my work and you will be proud to display it.</p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> What sort of quality can I expect?</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> Well, let's look at some of my recent custom sketches:</p>

<p><strong>Ernesto Palomino,</strong> only child, Fresno-born in the thirties, Movimiento mural marauder and solo flight painter rides fast and on multiple highways, a visual artist with the hands of a Californio Siqueiros, fast-strokes wild eyed into black acrylic on seamless paper, treated plywood blown out into abstract faceless pat-terns of the southwest as if in a psychic dream aquarium, then, a barrio wall smashed with farm worker Huelga fever paint thrown with love and rebellion, then, a blues chant piano riff remembering the days when his mother Elvira Ramirez hammered mandolin chords over thick night Fresno cabarets in the forties with Jesus Palomino, his father, hitting the high hat. This multiplicity of form, personal history and community connections informs Palomino's art, his original Pachukosis. </p>
<p>The early jazz years come up often in Ernesto's conversations, his intensities of hot music-man profiles and a howling jazz visual narrative; the Palomar Ballroom swings to the night grooves of Duke Ellington and Count Basie as the young Palomino meditates on Perez Prado and Sonny Rollins burns up the tracks across Chinatown. The mix, texture and beat of musical experimentation are core elements: compact sound bombs like Miles Davis and honey-like Mexico City harmonics like Trio Los Panchos. These jazz bolero explosions pushed Palomino to play keyboards and traps, to become a backup boy and intermission band player with the ""Blue Notes,"" sideman for Fats Domino and Laverne Baker in the fifties. Yet, the more profound resonances lie in his visual conjugations of color, line and form; Miles Davis wears ""Pachuko drapes,"" however, the ""drapes"" are Palomino's renditions across the canvas and city dweller walls and Miles' trumpet is the energy cycle within the frame that bursts onto the viewer. Dig? </p>
<p>All of this Chicano Fresno razz-ma-tazz stimulated the Palomino Pachukosis vision. Ernesto was nourished in this jazz bolero gypsy light so he could go on to scaffold Raza murals in the dawn-eyed blaze of the 60's Chicano Movimiento, so he could prop up his Benito Juarez portraits in community colleges, abandoned city streets and in Boy's Clubs. By the late sixties and on through the seventies, Palomino worked closely with poets such as Cleofas Vigil, Abelardo and Omar Salinas — all fiery kamikaze speaker-seers — breaking ground with his illustrations in their books and most of all, their ongoing project of locating and affirming a people's voice, the spoken word from the heart of the barrios across the Americas. In the same fashion, Palomino partnered up with the Royal Chicano Air Force from Sacramento, another experimental cultural political arts ensemble busy on the global mission of liberation and social justice. By the mid-seventies Palomino was building the Galeria Campesina, a key component in the formation of the Universidad de Campesinos Libres in Fresno, an alternative college founded by local artists and community members. </p>
<p>Palomino discovery comes in onslaughts of insight and tumultuous communications from unknown points in the universe; in the Spring of 1970, he received a telegram from the California State University at Fresno to apply in the heat of emergency to the Chicano Studies Program so that the college could survive Chicano boycotts and Movimiento combustion — here, Palomino became a speaker for La Raza, for campesinos and the United Farm worker's front-line. 1970 was the year of his Campesino mural on Tulare and F Street, one of the first Chicano murals in the West Coast, in tan-dem with the new mural movement undulating throughout the Southwest. By 1974, not long after his explorations with corporate and academic organizations such as CSU-F and the Universidad de Campesinos Libres, Palomino co-founded his own cadre of Fresno and Valley based artistas — ""La Brocha del Valle."" This loose-knit group of Valley artists organized exhibits, created home-grown galerias and connected with the larger national and international spheres of Chicano and Latin American political art: manifestoes, indigenous styles, mass Raza gatherings and multi-visual indictments on a nation lost in warfare, corporate globalization and cultural numbness. </p>
<p>""An only-child always wants to break out, there is only one, you got to be the good guy, you gotta be the one."" Palomino says, as he pulls at his brujo goatee musing over a plate of Vietnamese noodles. And so it is: Palomino, the ground breaker — a man intent on splashing Pachukosis with his black and white drawings, sculptures, assemblage, found objects, re-junlcified lost-culture paraphernalia and film. This is his brotherly conversation, his surge toward familia. </p>
<p>Hold on to the film ""52 Ford"" : it is the movie celluloid, cinema as art and culture strip — in a 28 minute 16mm format, that launches Palomino in 1960 from the ""promising one"" (receives the Cal Art Institute Scholarship in 1956) into the extra-ordinary artist of today. The movie and assemblage: you are inside a true 1952 Ford, part sculpture, part collage and theatre cast, a family of characters including a pot smoker, a multi-colored grandfather, car babies, wire birds and teenagers — who are you? Where are you going? What border-points are you crashing through? This ""moving"" art piece, assembled in 1960 can be seen as Palomino's initial attack and challenge to mainstream America. Here, he forges his new art figure, himself as artist, perhaps, all of us, as consensual drivers of our social condi-tion, this culture vortex termed ""our nation"" — a careening collec-tion of late fifties post war euphoria transposed into a compressed automobile-performance-art-culture-terminator where society loos-es its day-to-day Eisenhower identity and collapses into a Mex-Warhol re-formulation of things and signs gone astray, a Chicano Cantinflas detonation where the borders of the categories that we know fuse and fracture to become an eerie spectacle of de-structure, raw eye-ball slang, Low-rider re-formulations on American art and Chicano being. Enter Palomino's aesthetics and you step into a dan-gerous Pachukosis narrative on the crises and ruptures of our cur-rent collective consciousness. </p>
<p>Today, Ernesto Palomino reworks his early black ink drawings, he speaks in bursts of laughter and tenderness about his mother Elvira and father Jesus, he mentions his aloneness, his days in the art department at the university, then, he draws a fast X in his sketchbook and goes off into another dimension, the new work to be done, the fresh fire to be conjured — Palomino's journey: raise wild true versions of self and society, with a deep blue to red jazz palette knife brush. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>WHAT WE NEED</h3>
<p><span class=""style15""><strong>Arte Américas</strong> is looking to bring Ernie Palomino's bronze <span class=""style15"">statue</span> to Downtown Fresno. It is 8 ft wide by 6 ft thick. It stands 8 ft. high and weighs about a ton. It's estimated value is about $100,000. This has to be loaded and transported to the center. We also need to get lighting for the piece in order for it to be seen at night. A plaque will also be made with the artist statement and the necessary credits. Granville has already donated the <span class=""style15"">outdoor</span> base for the statue.<br/></span></p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>VIVA LA RAZA</h3>
<p>The statue is a fascinating look at the process of transforming a lifelong vision into reality. It began as an early 1970's mural exploring maternity, social injustice and the immigrant's struggle. Ernie has completed a towering bronze that represents an intriguing melding of an agricultural icon and Coatlicue, an ancient Aztec Earth goddess.</p>
<p>This beautiful piece depicting the horrific goddess of life and death, Coatlicue on the front side and the givers of life, the farm workers, on the backside, whimsically combined as the farm workers' truck, and is dedicated to those who have never been recognized for their contributions here in the Valley, the farm workers. The piece is the result of five years of diligent work in Ernie's studio and was financed entirely by him.</p>
<p><span class=""style15"">From your donations you will allow this beautiful bronze statue to finally have a home at Arte Américas. </span></p>
<p><span class=""style15""> </span></p>
<h3>ARTIST STATEMENT</h3>
<p><em>I have lived to be 76 years old. I’ve always known what to do artistically. I now have the power to create this monument to LA RAZA in bronze, a medium that will endure forever. Although I know I have many more years to produce art, if I were to die tomorrow, I would die at peace, in my element, knowing there is a monument to my “gente” immortalized in bronze.   </em><em><span class=""style15"">- Ernie Palomino </span></em></p></div>","WHO WE ARE

By the mid-seventies Palomino was building the Galeria Campesina, a key component in the formation of the Universidad de Campesinos Libres in Fresno, an alternative college founded by local artists and community members. 
Palomino discovery comes in onslaughts of insight and tumultuous communications from unknown points in the universe; in the Spring of 1970, he received a telegram from the California State University at Fresno to apply in the heat of emergency to the Chicano Studies Program so that the college could survive Chicano boycotts and Movimiento combustion — here, Palomino became a speaker for La Raza, for campesinos and the United Farm worker's front-line. 1970 was the year of his Campesino mural on Tulare and F Street, one of the first Chicano murals in the West Coast, in tan-dem with the new mural movement undulating throughout the Southwest. By 1974, not long after his explorations with corporate and academic organizations such as CSU-F and the Universidad de Campesinos Libres, Palomino co-founded his own cadre of Fresno and Valley based artistas — ""La Brocha del Valle."" This loose-knit group of Valley artists organized exhibits, created home-grown galerias and connected with the larger national and international spheres of Chicano and Latin American political art: manifestoes, indigenous styles, mass Raza gatherings and multi-visual indictments on a nation lost in warfare, corporate globalization and cultural numbness. 
""An only-child always wants to break out, there is only one, you got to be the good guy, you gotta be the one."" Palomino says, as he pulls at his brujo goatee musing over a plate of Vietnamese noodles. And so it is: Palomino, the ground breaker — a man intent on splashing Pachukosis with his black and white drawings, sculptures, assemblage, found objects, re-junlcified lost-culture paraphernalia and film. This is his brotherly conversation, his surge toward familia. 
Hold on to the film ""52 Ford"" : it is the movie celluloid, cinema as art and culture strip — in a 28 minute 16mm format, that launches Palomino in 1960 from the ""promising one"" (receives the Cal Art Institute Scholarship in 1956) into the extra-ordinary artist of today. The movie and assemblage: you are inside a true 1952 Ford, part sculpture, part collage and theatre cast, a family of characters including a pot smoker, a multi-colored grandfather, car babies, wire birds and teenagers — who are you? Where are you going? What border-points are you crashing through? This ""moving"" art piece, assembled in 1960 can be seen as Palomino's initial attack and challenge to mainstream America. Here, he forges his new art figure, himself as artist, perhaps, all of us, as consensual drivers of our social condi-tion, this culture vortex termed ""our nation"" — a careening collec-tion of late fifties post war euphoria transposed into a compressed automobile-performance-art-culture-terminator where society loos-es its day-to-day Eisenhower identity and collapses into a Mex-Warhol re-formulation of things and signs gone astray, a Chicano Cantinflas detonation where the borders of the categories that we know fuse and fracture to become an eerie spectacle of de-structure, raw eye-ball slang, Low-rider re-formulations on American art and Chicano being. Enter Palomino's aesthetics and you step into a dan-gerous Pachukosis narrative on the crises and ruptures of our cur-rent collective consciousness. 
Today, Ernesto Palomino reworks his early black ink drawings, he speaks in bursts of laughter and tenderness about his mother Elvira and father Jesus, he mentions his aloneness, his days in the art department at the university, then, he draws a fast X in his sketchbook and goes off into another dimension, the new work to be done, the fresh fire to be conjured — Palomino's journey: raise wild true versions of self and society, with a deep blue to red jazz palette knife brush. 
 
WHAT WE NEED
Arte Américas is looking to bring Ernie Palomino's bronze statue to Downtown Fresno. It is 8 ft wide by 6 ft thick. It stands 8 ft. high and weighs about a ton. It's estimated value is about $100,000. This has to be loaded and transported to the center. We also need to get lighting for the piece in order for it to be seen at night. A plaque will also be made with the artist statement and the necessary credits. Granville has already donated the outdoor base for the statue.
 
VIVA LA RAZA
The statue is a fascinating look at the process of transforming a lifelong vision into reality. It began as an early 1970's mural exploring maternity, social injustice and the immigrant's struggle. Ernie has completed a towering bronze that represents an intriguing melding of an agricultural icon and Coatlicue, an ancient Aztec Earth goddess.
This beautiful piece depicting the horrific goddess of life and death, Coatlicue on the front side and the givers of life, the farm workers, on the backside, whimsically combined as the farm workers' truck, and is dedicated to those who have never been recognized for their contributions here in the Valley, the farm workers. The piece is the result of five years of diligent work in Ernie's studio and was financed entirely by him.
From your donations you will allow this beautiful bronze statue to finally have a home at Arte Américas. 
 
ARTIST STATEMENT
I have lived to be 76 years old. I’ve always known what to do artistically. I now have the power to create this monument to LA RAZA in bronze, a medium that will endure forever. Although I know I have many more years to produce art, if I were to die tomorrow, I would die at peace, in my element, knowing there is a monument to my “gente” immortalized in bronze.   - Ernie Palomino",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2>Dear all !</h2>
<p>I´ve been dreaming of doing something else with my pictures than to just print them,frame them and stick them to a wall for a long time. I´m quite fond of knitting and all kinds of textile stuff. Some of you may know those old fashioned tapestry paintings which are either woven or knitted. So basically what I´m trying to do is transfer my collages into tapestry images with a modern touch.</p>
<p>Unfortunately this project is way to expensive for my budget and I could need some decent kickstart to realize the project.</p>
<p>If I reach the goal I would be able to knit 9 Collages into 100 x 100 or even somewhat bigger tapestries. If I raise more I could do even more if it´s less than I would also be happy so I could at least start the project.</p>

<p>Dear Friends, </p>
<p>We are Maya Ciarrocchi and Kris Grey, two
multi-disciplinary artists living and working in NYC.</p>
<p>Welcome to our IndieGoGo
campaign!</p>
<p>We need your help to
raise $7000, which will go towards the creation and presentation of our new
project Gender/Power.</p>
<p>The first iteration of Gender/Power will be
presented at the <a href=""http://www.gibneydance.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Gibney Dance Center</a> in March 2015. The money we raise from
this campaign will go directly towards paying the artists involved in this project
for their incredible work and towards other production costs such as, space
rental, marketing and administration. </p>
<div>
<p><b>What is the Project?</b></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Gender/Power is an
immersive installation activated by live performance and audience participation.The content of the work is created in collaboration
with individuals who have made specific decisions to <span>disrupt or
subvert gender signifiers. Focusing on embodiment,
identity, and representation, the
performers explore the dynamics of power in
relationship to gender.</span></p>
<p>Gender/Power<span>is comprised
of live performance within a projected environment. To create the elements of
the work, participants collectively devise a series of questions on the subject
of gender and authority. Each participant responds to the
questions then exchange their responses with
another group member who in turn recites this text
on camera and in performance. These recordings, in
combination with durational video portraits of the performers are
projected in performance and as an autonomous installation.</span></p>
<p>Gender/Power is a working <span>methodology that seeks to pose
questions about actual and perceived gender.
When the individuals in this piece claim the narratives of others,
the
social constructs of binary gender are destabilized exposing the
artificiality of our assumptions regarding gesture, clothing, and other social
signifiers that are used to define sex and power.</span></p>
<p>We see this work having several iterations, some performative with video
components, others <span>purely visual installation. We imagine
the work could eventually incorporate the voices of
individuals who do not appear in the performance and
act as a template for future performances and workshops with alternate
participants. Additionally we are working to create a catalog that includes
stills, transcripts of table work, performance reviews and
other documentation of our process as well as writings on the subject of gender
and power collected from outside sources.</span></p>

<p><b>What We Need &amp;
What You Get</b><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>It’s crazy how much money goes into creating a work of art. Many of us
work for free or for very little, yet we work because we must. It is important
to us that our collaborators, the amazing Becca Blackwell, Clarinda Mac Low and
Tigger! are paid a fair wage for their efforts. Not only does this help them
buy groceries but it also helps them continue with their own work. </p>
<p>The amount of time and effort that goes to the administrative side of art
making is ongoing and never-ending. Your support in addition to paying our
performers will help us pay for the administrative support of an arts
manager. </p>
<p>We’ve put together some super cool perks to help sweeten the deal.  Check them out!</p>
<p><b>Risks &amp;
Challenges</b><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>Gender/Power will be created and performed regardless if it is successfully
funded. However, if it is not funded we will need to cut rehearsal and
administrative costs which in turn may prevent the work from reaching its full
potential.</p>
<p>If we reach our $7000 goal we will be able to pay our collaborators a
modest wage and be able to afford administrative help.</p>
<p>If we raise $8000 we will be able to afford a two-camera documentation
set up. </p>
<p>If we raise $10,000 we will be able to pay our collaborators a higher wage
and print 200 copies of a limited edition catalog.</p>
<p>All of your contributions allow for us to focus more fully on the work
and our practice, which ultimately makes our work more available to you!</p>
<p>Thank you for your support! </p>

questions then exchange their responses with
another group member who in turn recites this text
on camera and in performance. These recordings, in
combination with durational video portraits of the performers are
projected in performance and as an autonomous installation.
Gender/Power is a working methodology that seeks to pose
questions about actual and perceived gender.
When the individuals in this piece claim the narratives of others,
the
social constructs of binary gender are destabilized exposing the
artificiality of our assumptions regarding gesture, clothing, and other social
signifiers that are used to define sex and power.
We see this work having several iterations, some performative with video
components, others purely visual installation. We imagine
the work could eventually incorporate the voices of
individuals who do not appear in the performance and
act as a template for future performances and workshops with alternate
participants. Additionally we are working to create a catalog that includes
stills, transcripts of table work, performance reviews and
other documentation of our process as well as writings on the subject of gender
and power collected from outside sources.

What We Need &
What You Get

It’s crazy how much money goes into creating a work of art. Many of us
work for free or for very little, yet we work because we must. It is important
to us that our collaborators, the amazing Becca Blackwell, Clarinda Mac Low and
Tigger! are paid a fair wage for their efforts. Not only does this help them
buy groceries but it also helps them continue with their own work. 
The amount of time and effort that goes to the administrative side of art
making is ongoing and never-ending. Your support in addition to paying our
performers will help us pay for the administrative support of an arts
manager. 
We’ve put together some super cool perks to help sweeten the deal.  Check them out!
Risks &
Challenges

Gender/Power will be created and performed regardless if it is successfully
funded. However, if it is not funded we will need to cut rehearsal and
administrative costs which in turn may prevent the work from reaching its full
potential.
If we reach our $7000 goal we will be able to pay our collaborators a
modest wage and be able to afford administrative help.
If we raise $8000 we will be able to afford a two-camera documentation
set up. 
If we raise $10,000 we will be able to pay our collaborators a higher wage
and print 200 copies of a limited edition catalog.
All of your contributions allow for us to focus more fully on the work
and our practice, which ultimately makes our work more available to you!
Thank you for your support!

<h3>
<br/>Spy Emerson and the Hook-Up Truck</h3>
<div>
<b>Hello... and yes, that really is my name!</b> It was given to me when I worked at the Limelight Nightclub NYC 1992, where I was a “Club Kid"" dressed in elaborate costumes and role playing nightly.  That was the start of my career as a Conceptual Artist (and total weirdo) and for over 20 years now, I have helped to shape significant movements in art culture, nationally and internationally. I ran the Bedroom Gallery in Prague, made music videos for Stones Throw Records, was a participating artist at Burningman for 18 years, I crashed the Venice Biennale with Swoon ...but mostly, I've made and shared a lot of meaningful art. <p></p>
<p><b>My current project, The Hook-Up Truck</b>, gained world-wide attention, shocking some, titillating others, and gave everyone something to talk about for a few weeks. In case you don't know already, The Hook-Up Truck is a mobile meeting room available for short term rentals accommodating sexual trysts. Basically it's a room within a 16' box truck you have sex in.  But really, it's much more than that. The Hook-Up Truck creates important  conversations about sex, and is representing an exercise in personal freedoms. .. you, may not want to f*ck in a truck yourself, but you should always have the right to do so.  </p>
<p><b>""Why is this art?"" you may ask... </b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Well, this is Conceptual Art, so it starts with an idea as the core to a project. The idea for The Hook-Up Truck project was to mimic the language of current advertising to sell something absurd, but totally relevant, while invading popular culture and getting lots of people talking about sexual freedoms.  </span></p>
<p>The truck is a work of art itself. Designed to be nondescript outside, and inside is a facade of cardboard boxes positioned to look like a half filled moving truck. From the street, it is indiscernible. The interior of the meeting room is small and red lit, I've been told it feels like a cross between a childhood fort and a strip club. There is a custom made  red vinyl and metal ""C"" shaped bench, and a ""C"" shaped bar above providing unique physical positioning capabilities for people of all sizes. The room is designed with practicality and hygiene in mind, its very easy to clean, and everything for cleanliness is  built right into the wall. The hand sanitizer, wet wipes, disinfectant wipes, condoms and more,  are all supplied within the room... (""Who cleans the room?"" you may ask...we draw straws).  The room is also outfitted with a camera for those who want to commemorate their experience, and allow me to use the footage for an art piece. Photography and Film are two of the more traditional art works happening during operation of the Hook-Up Truck (participants' identities are concealed and privacy respected).  A formal gallery exhibition of these art works  is planned.<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> And lastly, what makes this ""art"" is of course,  the experimental street theater, the interactive performance of running The Hook-Up Truck madness is quite entertaining for participants and sidewalk visitors alike. </span></p>
<p>We began with a giant bang, news crews following us around, dodging police, marching bands, getting kicked out of a street faire!! It was awesome.  It was all going so great...and then the truck DIED!! </p>
<p>I decided to take a well deserved break to try  and figure out the next steps. Public interest remains strong.  I was approached by four television production companies, and presented two contracts for reality TV shows. (I said no to it all for lack of integrity). </p>
<p>People continue to email me asking to use the Hook-Up Truck, there is more demand than we can handle with our current set up. We need to buy a truck, and we need money to put this all together with more sustainability. </p>
<div>
<p><b>We need to buy another truck, and we need to upgrade our operation  to handle the demand. </b>We are off to such an amazing start with only a well-worn shoestring budget, imagine what we could do if we if we had just a little money!! </p>
<ul>
<li>$8,000-10,000 for a 16' box truck with a lift gate (to be  wheelchair accessible)</li>
<li>$1,000 for air conditioner and lights</li>

<p>$19,500 we can get on the road, and running without worries....And if we don't reach the goal, whatever is raised will help us to rebuild this project.  The impact of your contribution is tremendously important!! It supports The Hook-Up Truck,  a provider of safe sex, a respite in shared living situations, and fun, with a powerful commentary.</p>
</div>
<p>Our challenges are big. With the varying attitudes about sex, I have been slandered as a slut, and equally praised a provocateur.  I fear our temporary monetary setback will reenergize the haters to downplay our successes. I hope instead, the lovers come out to support The Hook-Up Truck.</p>
