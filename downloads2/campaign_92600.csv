</h4><p></p><p></p><p>Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and other “open” social networks
allow us to constantly engage with friends, family, and co-workers using
third-party hosts. eMail establishes communications between users also w/ “open”
mail servers (hosts). The Internet itself allows users to search for
information on an unlimited number of servers - as “open and public connections”
– no special access….Contact with your bank is a form of “secure” access
over an encrypted link. The Internet offers “secure” purchases for products and
services. Cloud services offer a form of “secure” services using the Internet. “Their
hosts” support “clients”…<i><b><u>In all cases
the under</u></b><b><u>lying element is all transactions are processed on
someone’s facilities!...</u></b></i></p><h4>The
Internet User “as a Client” Has No Privacy…</h4>
<p>When there is private information
exchanged, it is carried a number of ways - using these third-party hosts, and
their gateways…. <b><i><u>The user is relegated to being a
“client”… </u></i></b><b><i></i></b></p>
<p><u>As a client the user works with servers/hosts -the
gateway for the application is at the server</u>…Raw Information Technology (""IT"") functions are deployed in all online servers
– banks, business, and cloud services, and these systems are actually “hosts”.
Businesses deploy IT functions with hosts to support their employees –
especially with remote access. Also, hosts support remote clients when securely
accessing the hosts i) bank accounts, and ii) when purchasing goods, online. Users are familiar
working online with their banks - entering ""user ID sign-in"", and ""password"".
Cloud-services operate similarly with an authorized account…</p>
<ul>
<li>
<u>Broadband ""carrier client""...</u> Broadband Carriers have separated themselves
     from security and privacy – they only provide a path into the Internet and a
     monthly bill! Sometimes they offer a do-it-yourself Internet Security from
     McAfee or Symantek and nothing else…</li>
<li>
<u>Privacy is lost </u><u>using clouds as ""service client""</u>… “Cloud
     services are built on someone else’s facilities”. Cloud offerings
     themselves are supported on 3<sup>rd</sup> party hosts (servers) – users
     are clients. Your data and your private information is on some one else’s
     facilities - subject to loss, hacking, and government intrusion. Under
     these services, users give-up their privacy and legal rights under
     broadband service contract terms”….</li>
</ul><h4>Cloud Services/Cloud Devices - Not the Answer…</h4>
<p>Most cloud solutions store your files on remote
servers that are shared with other customers and have terms of use allowing the
provider to access, review, distribute, and delete your files at any time.
Because of this, there can be legal ramifications for anyone that needs to
share private or confidential files. Cloud services use someone else’s
facilities - theirs!  Additionally, as an alternative cloud-devices are being
introduced and sold to consumers in specialized appliances - built on a ½ IT solution, and with additional cloud service billings.
These are being sold to support “private cloud” file handling/sharing of files with family or
friends and confidential documents with co-workers. Also, these devices are
being offered for synchronization across the Internet, file backups into clouds
and virtual drives for multipoint use…</p>
<p></p>
<h4>ipCLOUD – What’s In It?</h4>
<p><u>ipCLOUD is “electronic with facilities”…</u> It is
a complete system of IT – with multiple hosts and their facilities integrated
for administration into a simple user-interface – using a standard browser…The
user is both a host and a client and
hosted though a sign-in procedure that works much like your bank. ipCLOUD is a system
of hosts with “multiple” cloud services dedicated to a single user. The system
supports private social networking along with private file-sharing with friends, family, and co-workers.  Its “cloud server” supports its cloud applications/private
services – with “hosted” private control. The user owns and controls their data, maintains their own gateway, and privately handles all Internet communications … </p>
<h4><b>Its Unique = Multiple Clouds w/ User Facilities</b></h4>
<p>Netmax Communications is planning on releasing
ipCLOUD using its proprietary technology for deploying/setting up hosts
“internet privacy (ip)” through an integration of multiple servers simplified
for home/small business use. It’s a cloud system with facilities included. With
user controlled and resident facilities its web interface supports local users
on site in their LAN, and provides the ultimate level of security/privacy for
mobile users operating off-site. The system is designed to provide the privacy
protection unavailable with offsite cloud facilities/services handling
commercial data placement and applications. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/208117/files/20131118211705-spread-hosts.png?1384838225"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p></p><p>ipCLOUD supports a user-environment that is unachievable
with commercial cloud services – which rely on offsite services, and
offsite-gateways. ipCLOUD is an appliance with user “privacy” locked into broadband,
and ipCLOUD integrates their hosts. It incorporates an industrial IT grade
gateway/firewall for consumers – even adding additional software security
suites. The OS software is installed and combined with the system additions of
Web/URL filtering, security, plus the option of using AntiVirus and Anti-Spam
if needed. It contains modules that are used with encryption – fully protecting
privacy. These include transporting mail (iPRIVATE Mail), and closes the
openness of social networks (iPRIVATE Facebook (as an example) – used when
information is to be held as private. 
And, privacy-mode continues whenever signed-in to ipCLOUD with SSL
certificates. ipCLOUD even secures your Internet-access/links via proxy encryption or
VPN-tunnel when using unprotected WiFi when traveling. </p>
<h4>ipCLOUD – How Does It Handle
Privacy</h4>
<p>Using ipCLOUD the system provides
a user experience which is much like working online with a bank - 1) user ID
sign-in, and 2) password. Cloud-services operate similarly with an authorized
account…Under ipCLOUD the user hosts himself in the same way. And its all “private”. It allows
users “as hosts” to reach another level of – “privacy networking” through the
Internet without an IT department…</p><p></p><p>          <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/208127/files/20131118212129-Insert_Hosts_Diag.gif?1384838489"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h4><b>Modes of “Host-Yourself”
Privacy…</b></h4>

We designed ipCLOUD with user
social lifestyles in mind, email services, web-filtering and everything is built under
a single device integrating multiple hosts. The system provides the
front-end for any/all internet communications. It lets you share, collaborate, and
privately extend digital-communications to yourself when traveling and further extend digital-communications to anyone anywhere in the world - privately. ipCLOUD replaces
the need for outside services. As one example it provides an unlimited mix of back
up file options all supported under ipCLOUD controls.<br/><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/208136/files/20131118212543-Insert_Cloud_Diag.gif?1384838743"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>ipCLOUD
stores your data only on your local network where all digital communications are gated and
user-controlled. With your own facilities, you own and control your own system
of hosts. Also, all interconnected users in the LAN are subordinate to a system
of central control from a central resident gateway. In other words, it is centralized - completely private, it resides locally and provides security/privacy to all
networked computers - unlike offsite clouds, and their services. And best of all, using ipCLOUD is user
host-controlled without any outside controls or administration…</p>

cloud storage providers, the more services you require , the more you pay, and
most have restrictions on how they handle data including the size and type of
files you can store. There is a real cost in holding these files for
immediate/future use. With ipCLOUD, you own/control the data storage which you
can share “by invitation” and control how and who uses them. The
access and hosted sign-in is at no cost –you can access/share thousands of
files “privately” of any size or type with yourself or anyone else. Your
files are stored in ipCLOUD. …</span></p>
<b>Anywhere Access.</b> We've all been in
situations where we needed to access a file remotely. And “anywhere access” and
any look/read is through a military grade 3DES encrypted connection when accessing
a file remotely. All files stored on ipCLOUD are available anywhere in the
world from any computer or mobile device that has access to the Internet. <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> </span><p></p><p></p><p>                <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/213228/files/20131120212801-Home-Bus-Travel.jpg?1385011681"" src="""" style=""""/></p><span></span><p><b>100% Private. </b>Because
ipCLOUD is a private system you own and control, all your data is stored
directly on the ipCLOUD and is only shared with people you specify. Shared data
is mostly read through an encrypted connection directly to those people you
authorize. Unless you authorize a download copy the files never leave ipCLOUD.
Transfers between ipCLOUD devices are always encrypted during transit. </p>
<h4><b>Full Comparison to “Other” Cloud
Devices/Appliances</b></h4>
<p>Routers split the broadband
connection for multiple users so that 2-or-more computers have broadband
access. Some “other” deployments that provide fractional IT-solutions include
the use of sharing/synchronizing devices (appliances). These are subsystems, providing
a private cloud-service – by dividing down user’s residential/small office
gateway. An assignable IP address is applied – which drills a ”hole” in the
users gateway and sets up a subsystem. </p>
<p>Unlike cloud devices, ipCLOUD is the
full-gateway and a complete system of multiple clouds. It provides the Internet
protection using a state-level industrial grade firewall. It supports simplified
“hosted” IT services, locally-resident behind its gateway. And, these integrated
hosts specifically are user-configured to address privacy at the user’s
broadband connection. </p>
<p>The real comparison is how does
ipCLOUD with its hosts address Internet privacy. The host modes supported with
privacy - follows…</p>
<p></p><ul>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Hosts private
eMails, encrypted - read on users’ site -protecting against disclosing private,
political or personal information...</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Scrambles Web
Surfing. With address assignment/rotation – it makes it difficult to track
/pattern someone’s behavior on the internet...</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Privacy in
sending files = prevents “open transport” File Sharing of private/personal
information...</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">All internet
delivery applications are housed @ ipCLOUD – preventing port entry to an
internal IP address to a subsystem on the home network…</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Privacy/security
of “mobile access” via coffee shop/or any public hot spot – since the web connections
are executed behind the ipCLOUD via encrypted virtual connection…</span><br/>

<h4>How it Connects…</h4>
<p><b>Easy to Setup, fronts Existing Router<i> - </i></b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">As an appliance it easily installs to the broadband
WAN, and provides the central station “gateway” to connect the existing LAN. It
converts the broadband router/LAN into a subsystem still maintaining these
connections – requiring no networking changes. Establishes full “Central Control” and protection of all networked-computers at the consumer broadband
site through its “hardened” gateway – prevents security/privacy and
web-filtering changes at individual computers. Under ipCLOUD’s gateway all
privacy and security updates are delivered to the gateway, so that individual
computer updates are not needed…</span></p>
<h4>Project Status/Update
</h4>
<p>The Web Core Vista® proprietary technology was acquired. A full
set of its IT hosts has been proven in the business market as IT-in-a-Box®. Tens of thousands of IT-in-a-Box systems
were successfully built, sold, and are still in use today without “manufacturer
support” since the company discontinued operations.</p>
<p>We have more than
1000 units of IT-in-a-Box still available. Some of these units will be offered
for project participation to supporters of ipCLOUD, used as perks – offered with “limited support”. These systems
have a complete set of servers – designed for remote/small office business use under a much more classical technical administrator interface. These systems
have successfully been installed for home/business use and can still be used effectively with its built in simplified-IT. </p>
<p>IT-in-a-Box was an expensive system – selling at $2,000- $3,000/ea. However its earlier ""older design"" which supports a set of electronics is too costly to volume-build as
the ipCLOUD  appliance.  We have a new proprietary design with technology advances that meets consumer cost targets with additional capabilities for ipCLOUD-in-Box. Full funding of this project will
advance the new design, and provide prototypes and short-order quantities of
ipCLOUD for the initial orders under the perks. </p>
<p>We want of these systems available
to everyone. We need your help to move from prototype/short-order
quantities to production. By making a pledge today, you'll help get us closer
to our goal so we can advance the project and make ipCLOUD a reality.</p>
<h4></h4><h4></h4><h4>Risks and challenges</h4>
<p>There are significant design and manufacturing risks associated
with any complex electronic hardware product.</p>
<p>The team responsible for ipCLOUD has decades of experience in
overcoming these challenges and successfully bringing products to market. Many
of the Engineering and Operations executives are the same people responsible
for designing and manufacturing high-technology networking/appliances in
Silicon Valley. Their efforts has produced the following status for releasing
versions of ipCLOUDs..</p>
<p>Product releases will include early design releases of Techie
Super-ipCLOUDs using selected higher-cost x86-release computing appliances – extremely
powerful with capacity to support/use in larger businesses. Although more
expensive these versions may still prove attractive for “can’t wait” early
adopter “home techies” and “business techies” who want ipCLOUD for their family/home
business and/or small business. The design and manufacture of the low cost
ipCLOUD is scheduled and will follow:</p>
<p><b>Techie Super-ipCLOUDs – Design/Release...</b></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">SUPER x86 DESIGN: This design will be based
on – using standard x86 platforms, instead of the ""planned"" low-cost proprietary consumer
platform. These releases will effectively support Core Vista ipCLOUDs – with
more computing power.</span></p>
<p>APPLIANCE SELECTION/SOFTWARE: We have identified several
appliances that will support Core Vista and its conversion from IT-in-a-Box to
ipCLOUD. The “proven” integrated system of hosts under the proprietary
CoreVista software is being extended for ipCLOUD operation. The user-interface,
proven for simple IT administration is being coded for consumer/small business
ipCLOUD modes/services.</p>
<p></p><p>FIRST BUILD/SUPER TECHIE-RELEASE: In process – will support Core
Vista and its early conversion from IT-in-a-Box to ipCLOUD. Some of these early
selections will be offered as super-Techie-systems using powerful computing platforms. These ""super"" versions are still in classic IT - offered in both Gold-and-Platinum. These
systems will be available for Techie-Bundles using discounted coupons to purchase – September

<p>MECHANICAL: All mechanical components (industrial design, PCB,
plastic covers, tooling) is being planned with soft-tooling for the initial
release of ipCLOUD and will be ready for early build of consumer ipCLOUD - December
 2014.</p>
<p>ELECTRICAL: All electrical components for the product have been
identified into the ipCLOUD design – ipCLOUD Bill of Material (BOM) complete

Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and other “open” social networks
allow us to constantly engage with friends, family, and co-workers using
third-party hosts. eMail establishes communications between users also w/ “open”
mail servers (hosts). The Internet itself allows users to search for
information on an unlimited number of servers - as “open and public connections”
– no special access….Contact with your bank is a form of “secure” access
over an encrypted link. The Internet offers “secure” purchases for products and
services. Cloud services offer a form of “secure” services using the Internet. “Their
hosts” support “clients”…In all cases
the underlying element is all transactions are processed on
someone’s facilities!...The
Internet User “as a Client” Has No Privacy…
When there is private information
exchanged, it is carried a number of ways - using these third-party hosts, and
their gateways…. The user is relegated to being a
“client”… 
As a client the user works with servers/hosts -the
gateway for the application is at the server…Raw Information Technology (""IT"") functions are deployed in all online servers
– banks, business, and cloud services, and these systems are actually “hosts”.
Businesses deploy IT functions with hosts to support their employees –
especially with remote access. Also, hosts support remote clients when securely
accessing the hosts i) bank accounts, and ii) when purchasing goods, online. Users are familiar
working online with their banks - entering ""user ID sign-in"", and ""password"".
Cloud-services operate similarly with an authorized account…


Broadband ""carrier client""... Broadband Carriers have separated themselves
     from security and privacy – they only provide a path into the Internet and a
     monthly bill! Sometimes they offer a do-it-yourself Internet Security from
     McAfee or Symantek and nothing else…

Privacy is lost using clouds as ""service client""… “Cloud
     services are built on someone else’s facilities”. Cloud offerings
     themselves are supported on 3rd party hosts (servers) – users
     are clients. Your data and your private information is on some one else’s
     facilities - subject to loss, hacking, and government intrusion. Under
     these services, users give-up their privacy and legal rights under
     broadband service contract terms”….
Cloud Services/Cloud Devices - Not the Answer…
Most cloud solutions store your files on remote
servers that are shared with other customers and have terms of use allowing the
provider to access, review, distribute, and delete your files at any time.
Because of this, there can be legal ramifications for anyone that needs to
share private or confidential files. Cloud services use someone else’s
facilities - theirs!  Additionally, as an alternative cloud-devices are being
introduced and sold to consumers in specialized appliances - built on a ½ IT solution, and with additional cloud service billings.
These are being sold to support “private cloud” file handling/sharing of files with family or
friends and confidential documents with co-workers. Also, these devices are
being offered for synchronization across the Internet, file backups into clouds
and virtual drives for multipoint use…

ipCLOUD – What’s In It?
ipCLOUD is “electronic with facilities”… It is
a complete system of IT – with multiple hosts and their facilities integrated
for administration into a simple user-interface – using a standard browser…The
user is both a host and a client and
hosted though a sign-in procedure that works much like your bank. ipCLOUD is a system
of hosts with “multiple” cloud services dedicated to a single user. The system
supports private social networking along with private file-sharing with friends, family, and co-workers.  Its “cloud server” supports its cloud applications/private
services – with “hosted” private control. The user owns and controls their data, maintains their own gateway, and privately handles all Internet communications … 
Its Unique = Multiple Clouds w/ User Facilities
Netmax Communications is planning on releasing
ipCLOUD using its proprietary technology for deploying/setting up hosts
“internet privacy (ip)” through an integration of multiple servers simplified
for home/small business use. It’s a cloud system with facilities included. With
user controlled and resident facilities its web interface supports local users
on site in their LAN, and provides the ultimate level of security/privacy for
mobile users operating off-site. The system is designed to provide the privacy
protection unavailable with offsite cloud facilities/services handling
commercial data placement and applications. ipCLOUD supports a user-environment that is unachievable
with commercial cloud services – which rely on offsite services, and
offsite-gateways. ipCLOUD is an appliance with user “privacy” locked into broadband,
and ipCLOUD integrates their hosts. It incorporates an industrial IT grade
gateway/firewall for consumers – even adding additional software security
suites. The OS software is installed and combined with the system additions of
Web/URL filtering, security, plus the option of using AntiVirus and Anti-Spam
if needed. It contains modules that are used with encryption – fully protecting
privacy. These include transporting mail (iPRIVATE Mail), and closes the
openness of social networks (iPRIVATE Facebook (as an example) – used when
information is to be held as private. 
And, privacy-mode continues whenever signed-in to ipCLOUD with SSL
certificates. ipCLOUD even secures your Internet-access/links via proxy encryption or
VPN-tunnel when using unprotected WiFi when traveling. 
ipCLOUD – How Does It Handle
Privacy
Using ipCLOUD the system provides
a user experience which is much like working online with a bank - 1) user ID
sign-in, and 2) password. Cloud-services operate similarly with an authorized
account…Under ipCLOUD the user hosts himself in the same way. And its all “private”. It allows
users “as hosts” to reach another level of – “privacy networking” through the
Internet without an IT department…          Modes of “Host-Yourself”
Privacy…

We designed ipCLOUD with user
social lifestyles in mind, email services, web-filtering and everything is built under
a single device integrating multiple hosts. The system provides the
front-end for any/all internet communications. It lets you share, collaborate, and
privately extend digital-communications to yourself when traveling and further extend digital-communications to anyone anywhere in the world - privately. ipCLOUD replaces
the need for outside services. As one example it provides an unlimited mix of back
up file options all supported under ipCLOUD controls.ipCLOUD
stores your data only on your local network where all digital communications are gated and
user-controlled. With your own facilities, you own and control your own system
of hosts. Also, all interconnected users in the LAN are subordinate to a system
of central control from a central resident gateway. In other words, it is centralized - completely private, it resides locally and provides security/privacy to all
networked computers - unlike offsite clouds, and their services. And best of all, using ipCLOUD is user
host-controlled without any outside controls or administration…
Private Hosts in
ipCLOUD – How They Protect…


PRIVATE
     eMail - Send open-email notice to
     any user – alerting them to connect to a private hosted/encrypted HTML
     link into the ipCLOUD mail server to read. Much like your bank , there is
     a private sign-in to “read” the mail file via the piped encrypted
     connection.        

PRIVATE Social Networking - ipCLOUD will support a “private” sign-page
established under a user domain name. This private page will be controlled with
a user name and password sign-in. These private pages can be established on
Facebook and other social networks along with any published web site – it will
extend to blogs, tweets and any HTML addressable site….         


PRIVATE (Remote) No Tracking Web Surfing - ipCLOUD has a proxy mode
     when traveling that through a remote link, all web calls are executed
     behind the ipCLOUD firewall. This is a privacy feature along w/ WiFi
     security – providing no-snoop no-hack protection, hiding web surfing
     behavior.


PRIVATE (At Home) No Tracking
     Web Surfing -  ipCLOUD’s hosts are
     mostly on dynamic DNS (hard to track w/ ip address changes. Further ipCLOUD ip-rotation can be enabled for “no tracking” of web calls. WiFi security
     can also be enabled for neighborhood no-snoop no-hack protection.


PRIVATE Internet File Sharing - ipCLOUD has 2-methods of
     Internet file sharing 1) authorized FTP file up/downloads and 2) VPN
     encrypted file exchanges.


PRIVATE Application Modules - The ipCLOUD store will offer
     “private” application = attractive module that integrate and offer full
     cloud privacy, and security. These will work inside ipCLOUD will full
     protection.

ipCLOUD Doubles - with
Internet Security
ipCLOUD
also offers security system bundling – some free, and some with minimum fees.
The modules include the following protection. Under its central control all
security functions are established in-front of the connected PCs in the LAN so
no individual PC installs or setup is required…       • iBRICK Web Filter       • BigWALL Firewall        • i-INTUDER IDS/IPS       • iPOISON Virus Scanner       • iGARBAGE Anti-Spam         

BigWALL Firewall - State control of gateway
     w/ ports and settings. Commercial/industrial grade protection delivered
     to the home. This is a powerful firewall – included with UTM (Universal
     Threat Management) – used in commercial/industrial grade security systems.


iBRICK Web Filter - Centrally controlled web
     filter – controlled in system gateway. Manages all web calls from a
     central station – uses a simple browser interface. Commercial/industrial
     grade web filtering delivered to the home.


iIntruder IDS/IPS - Managed Internet security
     – IDS (Internet Detection Service), and IPS (Internet Prevention Service).
     These offerings are part of UTM (Universal Threat Management) – used in
     commercial/industrial grade security systems.

iPOISON Virus Scanner - Gateway/centrally
     controlled virus scanner – controlling viruses for all home networked
     computers. Unlimited licensed use – for all home connected computers.
     Typically included in UTM (Universal Threat Management) – used in
     commercial/industrial grade security systems.


iGARBAGE Anti-Spam - Gateway/centrally controlled anti-spam. Unlimited licensed use – for all
     home connected computers. Typically included in UTM (Universal Threat Management) – used in commercial/industrial grade security
     systems.
Unlimited No-Cost Access/Hosting. With online and
cloud storage providers, the more services you require , the more you pay, and
most have restrictions on how they handle data including the size and type of
files you can store. There is a real cost in holding these files for
immediate/future use. With ipCLOUD, you own/control the data storage which you
can share “by invitation” and control how and who uses them. The
access and hosted sign-in is at no cost –you can access/share thousands of
files “privately” of any size or type with yourself or anyone else. Your
files are stored in ipCLOUD. …
Anywhere Access. We've all been in
situations where we needed to access a file remotely. And “anywhere access” and
any look/read is through a military grade 3DES encrypted connection when accessing
a file remotely. All files stored on ipCLOUD are available anywhere in the
world from any computer or mobile device that has access to the Internet.                  100% Private. Because
ipCLOUD is a private system you own and control, all your data is stored
directly on the ipCLOUD and is only shared with people you specify. Shared data
is mostly read through an encrypted connection directly to those people you
authorize. Unless you authorize a download copy the files never leave ipCLOUD.
Transfers between ipCLOUD devices are always encrypted during transit. 
Full Comparison to “Other” Cloud
Devices/Appliances
Routers split the broadband
connection for multiple users so that 2-or-more computers have broadband
access. Some “other” deployments that provide fractional IT-solutions include
the use of sharing/synchronizing devices (appliances). These are subsystems, providing
a private cloud-service – by dividing down user’s residential/small office
gateway. An assignable IP address is applied – which drills a ”hole” in the
users gateway and sets up a subsystem. 
Unlike cloud devices, ipCLOUD is the
full-gateway and a complete system of multiple clouds. It provides the Internet
protection using a state-level industrial grade firewall. It supports simplified
“hosted” IT services, locally-resident behind its gateway. And, these integrated
hosts specifically are user-configured to address privacy at the user’s
broadband connection. 
The real comparison is how does
ipCLOUD with its hosts address Internet privacy. The host modes supported with
privacy - follows…


Hosts private
eMails, encrypted - read on users’ site -protecting against disclosing private,
political or personal information...


Scrambles Web
Surfing. With address assignment/rotation – it makes it difficult to track
/pattern someone’s behavior on the internet...


Privacy in
sending files = prevents “open transport” File Sharing of private/personal
information...


All internet
delivery applications are housed @ ipCLOUD – preventing port entry to an
internal IP address to a subsystem on the home network…


Privacy/security
of “mobile access” via coffee shop/or any public hot spot – since the web connections
are executed behind the ipCLOUD via encrypted virtual connection…

How it Connects…
Easy to Setup, fronts Existing Router - As an appliance it easily installs to the broadband
WAN, and provides the central station “gateway” to connect the existing LAN. It
converts the broadband router/LAN into a subsystem still maintaining these
connections – requiring no networking changes. Establishes full “Central Control” and protection of all networked-computers at the consumer broadband
site through its “hardened” gateway – prevents security/privacy and
web-filtering changes at individual computers. Under ipCLOUD’s gateway all
privacy and security updates are delivered to the gateway, so that individual
computer updates are not needed…
Project Status/Update

The Web Core Vista® proprietary technology was acquired. A full
set of its IT hosts has been proven in the business market as IT-in-a-Box®. Tens of thousands of IT-in-a-Box systems
were successfully built, sold, and are still in use today without “manufacturer
support” since the company discontinued operations.
We have more than
1000 units of IT-in-a-Box still available. Some of these units will be offered
for project participation to supporters of ipCLOUD, used as perks – offered with “limited support”. These systems
have a complete set of servers – designed for remote/small office business use under a much more classical technical administrator interface. These systems
have successfully been installed for home/business use and can still be used effectively with its built in simplified-IT. 
IT-in-a-Box was an expensive system – selling at $2,000- $3,000/ea. However its earlier ""older design"" which supports a set of electronics is too costly to volume-build as
the ipCLOUD  appliance.  We have a new proprietary design with technology advances that meets consumer cost targets with additional capabilities for ipCLOUD-in-Box. Full funding of this project will
advance the new design, and provide prototypes and short-order quantities of
ipCLOUD for the initial orders under the perks. 
We want of these systems available
to everyone. We need your help to move from prototype/short-order
quantities to production. By making a pledge today, you'll help get us closer
to our goal so we can advance the project and make ipCLOUD a reality.
Risks and challenges
There are significant design and manufacturing risks associated
with any complex electronic hardware product.
The team responsible for ipCLOUD has decades of experience in
overcoming these challenges and successfully bringing products to market. Many
of the Engineering and Operations executives are the same people responsible
for designing and manufacturing high-technology networking/appliances in
Silicon Valley. Their efforts has produced the following status for releasing
versions of ipCLOUDs..
Product releases will include early design releases of Techie
Super-ipCLOUDs using selected higher-cost x86-release computing appliances – extremely
powerful with capacity to support/use in larger businesses. Although more
expensive these versions may still prove attractive for “can’t wait” early
adopter “home techies” and “business techies” who want ipCLOUD for their family/home
business and/or small business. The design and manufacture of the low cost
ipCLOUD is scheduled and will follow:
Techie Super-ipCLOUDs – Design/Release...SUPER x86 DESIGN: This design will be based
on – using standard x86 platforms, instead of the ""planned"" low-cost proprietary consumer
platform. These releases will effectively support Core Vista ipCLOUDs – with
more computing power.
APPLIANCE SELECTION/SOFTWARE: We have identified several
appliances that will support Core Vista and its conversion from IT-in-a-Box to
ipCLOUD. The “proven” integrated system of hosts under the proprietary
CoreVista software is being extended for ipCLOUD operation. The user-interface,
proven for simple IT administration is being coded for consumer/small business
ipCLOUD modes/services.
FIRST BUILD/SUPER TECHIE-RELEASE: In process – will support Core
Vista and its early conversion from IT-in-a-Box to ipCLOUD. Some of these early
selections will be offered as super-Techie-systems using powerful computing platforms. These ""super"" versions are still in classic IT - offered in both Gold-and-Platinum. These
systems will be available for Techie-Bundles using discounted coupons to purchase – September
2014 – October 2014.Techie Bundles - IT-in-a-Box Perks...IT-IN-A-BOX TECHIE BUNDLES: Classic IT systems in the Techie-Bundles - Silver, Gold-and-Platinum. These systems are included in the paid Perks, and will be available immediately after the Indiegogo campaign - we expect to ship these units in August 2014.

proposals for a proprietary design of the consumer appliance which meets all
low-cost targets for ipCLOUD – ready for release with successful project
funding – April 2015 – May 2015.
MECHANICAL: All mechanical components (industrial design, PCB,
plastic covers, tooling) is being planned with soft-tooling for the initial
release of ipCLOUD and will be ready for early build of consumer ipCLOUD - December
 2014.
ELECTRICAL: All electrical components for the product have been
identified into the ipCLOUD design – ipCLOUD Bill of Material (BOM) complete
with new design – underway - completed December 2014.
SOFTWARE: The “proven” integrated system of hosts under the
proprietary Web CoreVista software is being extended for ipCLOUD. The
user-interface is being developed for consumers -  effort parallels the
mechanical/electronics  work. We are planning beta versions to test on
open x86 platforms to find and fix issues prior to production release.
PROTOTYPES/FIRST BUILD: We have identified an appliance package
for the prototypes and small quantity consumer build.  Soft-tooled plastic
is an option for the initial release of ipCLOUD. The appliance
packaging/housing will parallel the initial product release – planned into the
release, expected February 2015.
FULL VOLUME PRODUCTION: We have offshore suppliers ready for the
volume build of 1,000 and 10,000 piece lots – available 90 days after short

I can just about manage my phone because its nice and slim and I need it readily available at all times…like most of us I guess. The problem for me is when you add a wallet to the package. The wallet makes two things to carry and it’s pretty bulky.  It’s got my ID, 15 cards of which I only really use two of regularly, and a bunch of other stuff that I don’t even know where it came from.
The times that I have been out and left it in another coat pocket, or left it at home, or stuffed it down the side of the seat in my car and then can’t find it, its even disappeared for the best part of a week in my wife’s handbag because the weather was nice and I didn’t have a decent pocket to put it in! BUT I almost never forget my phone, my phone goes almost everywhere, and if I lose it I have an app for that :)
So, I came up with the idea of CellClipz (patent no 61813185).
 
It’s not designed to replace that trusty old Fat Wallet for those of you that need one, but once you start using it you will quickly realaize that you don’t need the Fat Wallet most of the time. I’ve been using a demo version of CellClipz  for 3 months and not at any time have I needed my Fat Wallet! Everyone that sees me with it wants one…So I really want to get this into production so that we can offer a good alternative to Fat Wallet. 
We intend to make a short production run for the iPhone 4 in just two colors (black and brown) in September this year, and produce in bulk for iphone 4 & 5, as well as several other leading smart phones in 2014 and more colors. We already have an excellent manufacturer signed up and the material specifications established, the mould design and specs are completed, the mould manufacturer is sourced and known to us,  and we already have interest from several big box stores for 2014.    
My background is manufacturing and marketing and I’ve been lucky enough to have worked with many great companies and on lots of complicated projects, companies like…

So your investment is in safe hands :)
What We Need & What You Get
The main costs involved at this moment are the patented case moulds and the specially designed billfold clip, our manufacturer is more than happy to produce a small run for us this year, so we just need to raise the target of $15,000 to start production. If we don’t reach the $15k the funds will be returned to you, the important thing is to get the ball rolling so we have something to build on:)
If we exceed our target we will also produce a limited run of a CellClipz iPhone 5 version, this will be updated here on Indiegogo and we will add it as an option when possible. 
Don’t forget that Cellclipz is a patented product, only available here and not available anywhere else until main production in 2014. You will be the first to own, gift or distribute these limited edition CellClipz. The retail price next year will be $39.97
Now to encourage and reward our investors we have several plans for you to consider.
#1        $5 – No case but your name will go down on the CellClipz website wall of fame as a founding investor ! 
#2        $20 Early bird investor, a hot off the press limited edition crocodile print Cellclipz case in Brown!

#3        $20 Early bird investor, a hot off the press limited edition crocodile print Cellclipz case in Black!
#4        $29  Regular investor, a hot off the press limited edition crocodile print Cellclipz case in brown! (as above)
#5        $29  Regular investor, a hot off the press limited edition crocodile print Cellclipz case in black! (as above)
#6        $50 Twin pack 1 Black 1 Brown limited edition crocodile print Cellclipz cases

 #7        $100 5 Pack 2 Black 3 Brown limited edition crocodile print Cellclipz cases
#8        $1500  - Distributor pack 100 limited edition crocodile print Cellclipz cases (50 Black 50 Brown)

Props from the Space Cadet team! (hi-fives all around!)
How far along is the project?We've finished the entire process of design and tooling development, and we have already produced a small batch for quality testing and marketing.  When you back us, you can be sure the Space Cadet will be shipping out within the weeks of campaign closing.  What happens when we hit the funding goal? What about stretch goals?In addition to helping us realize our project, once the funding goal is reached, we have multiple tiers of stretch goals planned.  I can't give away too much until we actually hit the funding goal, but here's a hint: Dark side of the moon.Risks and challengesWe have committed our resources to design and develop the Space Cadet ahead of crowdfunding.

<p>Hello, my name is Ryan! And I am a game developer for the past 10 years I have been developing small indie games and focusing on improving my skill set while juggling various full time software development jobs at local companies in Australia.</p>
<p>I propose to you all today my game concept and idea Biolab Chronicles a game loosely based around pop culture sci-fi horror and zombie films it will launch for windows and mac first and then make the transition to IOS via minimal porting effort due to the cross platform nature of the developer tools</p>
<p>As you may have seen from the demo video, the game is progressing along significantly since I began development, However as an indie developer and as I am sure you are all aware managing, organizing, developing and every other aspect of the game design process is a huge undertaking for a single person.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>Currently I have invested in the developer tools required to develop and publish this game to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows / Windows 8</li>
<li>Mac</li>
<li>IOS</li>
<li>Android</li>
</ul><p>And have a registered developer account with all of the above platforms app stores.</p>
<p>I have also made the initial investment in art assets as you can see from the high quality polished nature of the demo video. However there is much more that can be done to raise the quality of this game even further it is my proposal and hope to raise the funds so that I may hire an artist to compose a 6 – 12 track sound track for the game, and to hire an artist to design some more resources</p>
<p><strong>A Little Technical Overview on the Game</strong></p>
<p>So I would like to speak here about some of the cool features I’ve added to the game already.</p>
<p>Firstly I would like to start by saying that this is powered by the box2D physics library the player the monsters the bullets almost every object in the game is a physics controlled object this allows for some interesting 2D Effects such as objects flying across the floor, bullet shells rolling, guns having recoil and enemies being pushed away when shot.</p>
<p>I have developed a dynamic lighting engine which you will see in the demo video in action. It works by using alpha transparency and the concept of stencils to cut through a thick layer of black then it adds colour radiating from the centre of this cut out which allows for completely real-time and dynamic lighting on mobile devices with minimal performance impact</p>
<p>There is an environmental ambiance layer which slowly flows throughout the level this works in a similar way to the lighting system however I am using a noise based algorithm to generate what looks like clouds and then filtering the alpha channel to achieve some level of ambient fog in the levels</p>
<p>Finally the unique blood splatter system which takes between 2 and 5 unique blood splatter decals. Rotates, skew’s, stretches and blends them into a single pool maintaining a pointer to 1 or 2 of those blood splatters then over time they fade away at random speeds while the 2 maintained references are slowly animated this allows for some amazing gore with over 100,000 unique splatter animations again generated procedurally uniquely animated with minimal performance hit to mobile devices.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>If I am able to achieve the amount requested it will give this game the boot it needs to make it with the big players in the vast yet ever evolving indie game landscape. I would be able to spend some more time developing and contract some third party assistance for things like graphics and audio.</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>I would appreciate all feedback be it positive or negative with great enthusiasm as all feedback will only help to make this game better.</p></div>","Short Summary

leads to loss of important data but also to lots of money being wasted on
buying new ones. These are the reasons why this option is no longer appealing. Not

key factors.</span><br/></p>

<p><b>Adjusting and Tuning Pinto: </b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">We are creating a brand new category in storage devices
which comes with many challenges. Therefore Pinto might have to undergo some
minor adjustments in order for the best quality and functionality to be
achieved. Our key priorities in designing Pinto are Data Safety, User
Experience and Great Value.</span></p>
<p><b>Manufacturing Pinto: </b>Due to the unique nature of Pinto's
design, there are numerous parts involved in the process that need to be
manufactured and assembled separately. Our manufacturing partners have a solid
record for delivering on time and keeping the manufacturing quality high.</p>
<p><b>Delivering Pinto to your Wrist: </b>We want you to start using your Pinto
as soon as possible. However sometimes unforeseen events might occur that can
cause delays. We don’t want to take any chances in delivery of your Pinto and
that’s why we take our Partnerships and Collaborations very seriously. We
are working with the best manufacturing and fulfillment companies, suppliers
and professionals that are highly experienced in what they do and nothing less
than that. Any detail during the overall process is thoroughly and responsibly
reviewed and checked.</p>
<p><b>Our Code of Ethics and You:</b> A satisfied customer and backer
means the world to us. That is why we are trying to bring to life a unique product
that will not only make the wait worthwhile, but will also make your everyday
digital life easier and safer. Please keep in mind that no matter what pledge
you choose it brings Pinto a step closer to reality!</p>
<p><i>In case you can’t afford to Pledge, you can still make a

family.</i></p>

</div></div>","Pinto is the world's first Storage Wristband with no USB Plug! It connects to your Bluetooth enabled devices with the help of Bluetooth technology and you can use it to access or store your personal or business files. In short, Pinto incorporates all the good qualities of
Cloud storage and Flash drives and none of their drawbacks!
Pinto is designed to be a True Wearable device: you don’t ever
have to take it off. It Charges and Operates Wirelessly. Plus it’s waterproof!
For consumers who seek maximum security, accessibility and ease
of use in file storage devices Pinto is a whole new category of products that
provides unique features in the form of a wearable device.





















Everybody uses at least one way to store personal and business files.
The most common ways are Cloud storage, USB Flash drives and other means such
as External Hard Drives, DVD’s, etc.
While these options have many advantages they also come with
substantial limitations. 




Cloud storage has become one of the most preferred ways to store files; however
the only certain thing that Cloud’s safety record shows us is that this option
is only safe until the next breach. Therefore, a lot of users have lost trust
in Cloud especially when it comes to sensitive and important personal and
business files.








Flash drives are easy to lose, damage and/or break which not only
leads to loss of important data but also to lots of money being wasted on
buying new ones. These are the reasons why this option is no longer appealing. Not
to mention that Flash drives cannot be used on portable devices such as Smartphones
or Tablets.








Pinto has been conceived and designed to provide maximum security,
accessibility and ease of operation. This way users can truly feel safe when
they store files and also feel confident that they can access them at any time
from any Bluetooth enabled device, without having to worry about Internet
presence or Security Breaches.






 





Pinto has come to revolutionize the way users store Files. It is
the world’s first wearable device that is used for File Storage; that is why
Pinto is creating a new category in File storage. The Wearable Storage
Category! 














Pinto is a True Wearable device! Why? No need to ever take it off! It
operates wirelessly, is waterproof and even charges wirelessly! That’s right!
You can charge Pinto while it is on your Wrist! How is this achieved?? With The
Charging CAP!







The Charging CAP is a round shaped charging Adapter that magnetizes
on the round bottom of Pinto’s Rubber Band. It allows charging Pinto without
having to take it off! 












The charging PAD is a slim and elegant Pad that is placed right next
to your laptop or keyboard. The top surface of the PAD is covered with a
comfortable silicone layer making the charging process pleasant and fun! Just rest
your wrist on the pad and carry on with your work!

Pinto has a US and International Patent Pending Status





For the past year we have been working hard to bring a new
product into  the storage device category. We
have extensively researched every step of the File storage process and made all
necessary improvements adding incredible user experience and safety above all! 











File Storage is a very important everyday operation that
every user needs to perform. Regardless of the type of device being used or the
amount of Data being stored, Safety and Ease of Access and Operation are the
key factors.

Adjusting and Tuning Pinto: We are creating a brand new category in storage devices
which comes with many challenges. Therefore Pinto might have to undergo some
minor adjustments in order for the best quality and functionality to be
achieved. Our key priorities in designing Pinto are Data Safety, User
Experience and Great Value.
Manufacturing Pinto: Due to the unique nature of Pinto's
design, there are numerous parts involved in the process that need to be
manufactured and assembled separately. Our manufacturing partners have a solid
record for delivering on time and keeping the manufacturing quality high.
Delivering Pinto to your Wrist: We want you to start using your Pinto
as soon as possible. However sometimes unforeseen events might occur that can
cause delays. We don’t want to take any chances in delivery of your Pinto and
that’s why we take our Partnerships and Collaborations very seriously. We
are working with the best manufacturing and fulfillment companies, suppliers
and professionals that are highly experienced in what they do and nothing less
than that. Any detail during the overall process is thoroughly and responsibly
reviewed and checked.
Our Code of Ethics and You: A satisfied customer and backer
means the world to us. That is why we are trying to bring to life a unique product
that will not only make the wait worthwhile, but will also make your everyday
digital life easier and safer. Please keep in mind that no matter what pledge
you choose it brings Pinto a step closer to reality!
In case you can’t afford to Pledge, you can still make a
difference towards Pinto's success by sharing this Project with friends and
family.

<p><i></i></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/878777/files/20140924051653-Slide1.jpg?1411561013"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Spherical Aberration is an effect created by normal lenses. The light cannot focus on one point.  This is because the light travelling through the peripheries of the lens are refracted (bended) more than light travelling through the centre of the lens.<br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/878778/files/20140924051713-Slide2.jpg?1411561033"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p><b>Recommendation</b><br/></p>
<ul>
<li>Your smartphone or tablet should have at least a 3 Mega Pixel camera to obtain the best quality shots</li>
<li>Adequate lighting is essential</li>
<li>MAGcro lenses may require cleaning from time to time, use our provided micro-fibre cloth to clean</li>
<li>MAGcro lenses are coated with anti-scratch but they not 100% scratch proof, purposefully scratching it is not recommended</li>
<li>It has a short focal length, so bring your camera close up, really close up. <br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Protective Case</b></p>
<p>We have also thought of ways to protect our precious lens.  Below various different ways of safe keeping your lens while using it as a key-chain.  We are still at the stage of producing a prototype.<br/></p>

<h2>BEHIND THE SCENES<br/>
</h2>
<p></p>
<figure style=""margin: 0px;""><div>
<p><b>History of Product Development: MAGcro</b></p>
<p>OphthalmicDocs are a special collaboration between two trained 
doctors who are very particular about both detail and providing the best
 level of care for their patients. </p>
<p>Both Dr. Hong, Sheng Chiong and Dr. Ben O'Keeffe have a special 
interest in ophthalmology (eye's) and they realised that each time they 
saw an interesting finding in someone's eye, it was always a struggle to
 get a good picture. Bringing the phone to near would render the picture
 out of focus, too far, and the details were lost.</p>
<p>This initiated the idea to create their own macro lens and bought the
 invention of the EyeChamp to life, which was the very first macro lens 
that was created with the aim of using if for capturing medical 
conditions, aiming to aid in both diagnosis and management.  </p>
<p>After a successful launch on Kickstarter in September 2014, it became
 obvious that our macro lens was being used not just by doctors but also
 the wider community using it for recreational macro photography.  
</p>
<p><span>Since
 then, OphthalmicDocs received a lot of feedback and requests to develop
 a macro lens that fitted all smartphones and tablets even with their 
protective casing on. We searched the current market and there were some
 interesting lenses that we found, one designed with a rubber band and 
other designed as a silicone plastic lens. While they were all good 
products we knew we had the special advantage with our extensive 
training in optics and ophthalmology and we aimed to create something 
that was more robust, would last longer and a lens that wouldn't be prone to various aberrations that can affect image quality.  </span></p>
<p>This
 is when the idea, the design and the need for the MAGcro was born. 
 OphthalmicDocs have now come to the right time to offer the MAGcro to 
be available to the public and it starts with your support within a 
crowdfunding project through indiegogo.
</p>
<p>At first glance you may not think there is anything new to our MAGcro
 lens. The magnetic holder used in the MAGcro is not new. You may have 
seen a number of similar 'looking' products on the market, so what makes
 us different? It is the knowledge we gain from our experience and 
knowledge of optics and medicine that gives us a superior lens design and understanding of quality.</p>
<p>At OphthalmicDocs we st<span>arted
 off with using ophthalmic lenses easily available in our ophthalmology 
department.  We soon moved on to other smaller powerful lenses. 
 Through trial and error we 
soon realised that small lenses with the following dimensions worked 
best : 8 - 10mm diameter with a focal length of 10-15mm.</span></p>

FEATURES OF MAGcro 


Magnetic base macro lens 


10x magnification 

No battery required


Designed by healthcare professionals

High quality optical glass
Devoid of Spherical Aberration



It has a magnetic base that fits your phone perfectlyNow capture those close ups that you've always wanted to but missed because you've never had access to an expensive macro lens.
Introducing the MAGcro lens which is designed to be a magnetic macro lens that fits your smartphone and tablet device.  









What is so special about MAGcro?MAGcro uses an aspheric lens.  Normal lenses have a symmetrical spherical surface which makes it prone to spherical aberration which could degrade the quality of your macro photographs.  For MAGcro, we are using specially designed aspheric lenses. 

Spherical Aberration is an effect created by normal lenses. The light cannot focus on one point.  This is because the light travelling through the peripheries of the lens are refracted (bended) more than light travelling through the centre of the lens.


Our aspheric lens focuses all light onto one point, which provides superior image resolution.
 Putting on MAGcro

The magnetic base fits any phones with a metal case

Dimension of the MAGcroDiameter: 15mm
Height : 5.2mm
Recommendation

Your smartphone or tablet should have at least a 3 Mega Pixel camera to obtain the best quality shots
Adequate lighting is essential
MAGcro lenses may require cleaning from time to time, use our provided micro-fibre cloth to clean
MAGcro lenses are coated with anti-scratch but they not 100% scratch proof, purposefully scratching it is not recommended
It has a short focal length, so bring your camera close up, really close up. 


Protective Case
We have also thought of ways to protect our precious lens.  Below various different ways of safe keeping your lens while using it as a key-chain.  We are still at the stage of producing a prototype.

Provisional protective case

Designing MAGcro
We started off simple, with a pen and pencil creating sketches of the device.  This was the fun and exciting part!

Photorealistic rending prior to physical prototyping 
Story behind the making of the MAGcroWatch the following video to understand what we went through and how we decided which lens is the best lens for the MAGcro.What is Spherical Aberration? And what is so special about our lens?Watch the following video to understand what spherical aberration is and how it affects image quality.  
Function
MAGcro is made of an aspheric convex lens that instantly converts your smartphone or tablet camera into a macro camera.  It is easily magnetically attached and has a focal length of 10mm with a magnification of up to 10 times giving you crisp clear images. Have a look at the macro shots below.

Macro Photo AppWe are also collaborating with photographers and app developers to recommend the best photo editing app that is suitable for both iOS and Android. The screen shots below are taken with Adobe Photoshop Express which is our current recommended photo app.




Can I use it on my phone?MAGcro's magnetic fit is only suitable for phones with a metal case.  Alternatively, we provide you a self adhesive metal ring that attaches onto your smartphone or tablet to be used with the MAGcro.  If you don't want to attach the ring we have also developed micro suction cups that can be fitted onto your MAGcro making it attachable on almost all kinds of devices. You decide, use the micro suction cups or magnetism. Watch the following video to find out.Micro suction cup sheets.  1 square cm comes with thousands of tiny micro suction cups. We are using this method to mount MAGcro onto phones and tablets that does not come with a metal case.PRODUCTION PLANWe aim to deliver this entire project within 6 months.  Product design started in June 2014.  We aim to release the first pre-order by December 2014.  Official launch will be January to February 2015.  We aim to ship your rewards before Christmas 2014.  *Note : International backers may only get their rewards in January 2015.Stretch Goals!We need your support to make this a success.  And if you could help us achieve more than what we asked for, we would be bringing in more colour choices for you.  Opening up a new colour is expensive, we need to make sure we have the minimum quantity to make it affordable.$7000 - If we could raise above $7000, we would install the micro suction cups onto all MAGcro making them universal to all phones and devices.Help us bring these colours to you!
How much do we need?
We need $5,000 to bring MAGcro onto the production line.  We have already selected our manufacturer and we just need your support to get it started.
$5,000 is not a lot.  But it is a lot for a small group like us to help bring up the volume for manufacturing.

<p>Duet is designed with modularity in mind. If you're like us, you'll be using your Duet beside your bed on your nightstand a majority of the time. But depending on which side of the bed your nightstand is, you'll likely want a certain order of accessibility when it comes to your charging hub. </p>
<p>For instance, let's say you want your iPhone to be closer to you than your Apple Watch when you're lying in bed, so as to make things easier when you want to grab your phone to peruse Instagram or check your email in the middle of the night.

<p>That's why we've designed two possible configurations for Duet. The iPhone dock piece, being perfectly symmetrical, will be the same across all setups.

</div></div>","Duet works with: iPhone 5, iPhone 5c, iPhone 5s, iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 6s, and iPhone 6s Plus - with (most) cases or without a case. 
Apple Watch is here to make your life easier. But adding another device to your charging routine makes things complicated.
Duet changes that by bringing both your iPhone and Apple Watch into one beautifully simple charging hub.

Who's talking about Duet?



Just some of what they're saying:
BGR: ""Meet Duet, the charging dock Apple Watch owners are going to love""
Redmond Pie: ""... if you own an Apple Watch and an iPhone, you might want to get your credit card out soon.""
MacRumors: ""... a sleek design that closely matches the look of the MacBook, iPad, iPhone and other anodized aluminum Apple products.""
AppleInsider: ""... we came away impressed with the design's concept and, more importantly, execution.""
Apple World Today: ""The Duet has a simple solid elegance to it that doesn’t detract from the beauty of the Apple Watch and iPhone but instead reinforces the work of Jony Ive and crew.""
GeekDad: ""Constructed of solid aluminum, the stands are sturdy, lightweight, and well-balanced ... while maintaining the same aesthetic as my other Apple products.""








Let's simplify.
Apple Watch helps you better manage your notifications, allows you to stay even more connected with your contacts, and generally should make things a little more simple. Yet dealing with another device to charge daily seems to take some of the magic away from the experience. 
We think it should be easier than that. With Duet Dock, there's no need to worry about your charging routine, messy cables, or where you'll keep your devices when they're not in use. Just place your iPhone and Apple Watch in their new home and you're done.



Solid. 
From the moment you get your hands on your Duet, you'll notice its weight. It's precisely machined from a solid block of aluminum, giving it the best possible premium feel to match your devices.
The solid weight, along with the nano suction pads on the underside of the dock, means your Duet will stay firmly in place on any smooth surface you set it down. So carry on, you rebel, with your one handed docking and undocking - life's too short not to.




A magnetic attraction.

Of course you want your charging hub to look good. We do too. And yet we also realize it's not just what's on the outside that counts, but what's hidden inside as well. Duet is fitted with neodymium magnets, tucked away in each side, which allows the Apple Watch piece to click together perfectly with the iPhone piece.




In perfect harmony.
Duet is designed with modularity in mind. If you're like us, you'll be using your Duet beside your bed on your nightstand a majority of the time. But depending on which side of the bed your nightstand is, you'll likely want a certain order of accessibility when it comes to your charging hub. 
For instance, let's say you want your iPhone to be closer to you than your Apple Watch when you're lying in bed, so as to make things easier when you want to grab your phone to peruse Instagram or check your email in the middle of the night. In this case, you'll want to make sure the Apple Watch arm is on the other side of your iPhone. 
That's why we've designed two possible configurations for Duet. The iPhone dock piece, being perfectly symmetrical, will be the same across all setups. However, when you choose your Duet setup, you'll be asked whether you want your Apple Watch to be on the left or the right side of your iPhone, giving you control over a layout that's more personalized to your particular preference.



Performs solo, too.
While we designed Duet to be a two-part charging hub, we understand that there are going to be times you'd like to charge your Apple Watch or iPhone separately, perhaps in a different area of your home or office. That's why we've designed both pieces of Duet to look (and work) great apart from each other as well. 
Use your Duet primarily on your nightstand, but want to charge your iPhone at your computer while you work? Simply lift the iPhone dock away from the Apple Watch arm, and take it to your desk. 



Versatile.


Duet doesn't discriminate. Regardless of what iPhone you have, as long as it has a Lightning Connector, it'll work perfectly in the dock. In other words, Duet works with: iPhone 5, iPhone 5c, iPhone 5s, iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 6s, and iPhone 6s Plus - with (most) cases or without a case.


Understatedly colorful. 


OK, so we know we said that what's on the inside counts. And while it does, your new home base for your iPhone and Apple Watch shouldn't just work well - it should look good too. Available in Silver, Space Gray, Gold, and Matte Black finishes, Duet offers a backdrop that will perfectly complement your device lineup.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Our team has built a working prototype Smartphone app that allows a user to communicate directly with the top management of US companies and their regulators while also posting the communication to Social Media, the press and business reviewers, such as Trip Advisor. The app’s database to which we are adding daily, currently contains the email addresses for the executives of over 250,000 US companies and we will use the funds to polish the prototype, build additional functionality and roll it out to the App Store.</p>
<p>A team of friends started this project from scratch over a year ago and we are proud of what we have accomplished. We want to give the underdog consumer the leverage to have their message heard by the business leaders that make a difference. We want to roll the app out across the US within 3 months so that all consumers will have the opportunity to have greater leverage in their dealings with businesses. Our software and processes are protected by a pending patent.</p>
<p>If you are tired of not being heard Consumer Angel’s app, BlastEm, will give you a voice that will be difficult to ignore.</p>
<p>We have a blog, <a href=""http://blog.consumersangel.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://blog.consumersangel.com</a> , which has established our credentials as a consumer advocacy organization. The blog currently has over 90 followers, many of whom are other consumer advocacy organizations.</p>
<p>Our successful Indiegogo campaign and the following we are developing with our blog will provide the user base we need to get the app in the hands of people who need it.</p>

<p>The Starfish Defender 80 series (named for Starfish Prime nuclear tests that ""discovered"" electromagnetic pulse (EMP)) hardens electronics vs. EMP/radio waves/cell phone reception/GPS to protect your privacy. Internet is still accessible through wireless. <strong>It's been tested far above military standard for EMP shielding. </strong>There are two main variants: the cell phone kit and the laptop shield.<br/><br/>NOTE: All items shown are prototypes - they have also been tested extensively for wear and tear. Your products as received would be in factory condition.<br/><br/><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">What It Does</span></strong><strong><br/></strong><br/><strong>The phone kit is 2 nested cell phone bags.</strong> The inner bag blocks reception &gt;1000 feet from a cell tower. Add the other bag to block service even next to the tower - so you can't be tracked and your phone can't be used as a mike to spy on your conversation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Online reviews of other ""Faraday cell phone bags"" state that they don’t work - because those products can’t block enough signal if close to a cell tower. <strong>Our product can.</strong>
</li>
<li>Some people say ""You can just remove the battery to avoid tracking."" But iPhone batteries can't be removed.</li>
<li>The phone kit doubles as EMP protection.</li>
<li>Now you can say ""Sorry, my phone was cut off by the shield to avoid 'them' tracking me - I wasn't avoiding your call!""</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The laptop shield version attenuates EMP, which can fry your electronics permanently. </strong>There are three main EMP solutions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hardened electronic equipment – rough and tough, but expensive - $5-15K each! You can save 99% of your money while getting 99% of the effectiveness!</li>
<li>Shielded rooms – immobile and still expensive - may also require specialized A/C.</li>
<li>Small Faraday cages – cheap, but you have to choose between putting your laptop in a metal box or using it - and you probably won’t know when an EMP will hit.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Our Defender provides military level usability and protection for under $90 – the best of all worlds.</strong> As with all cheaper solutions, no outside connections can be used, but future upgrade kits will filter connections in/out of the shield, making it the ideal low-cost solution <strong>You can now rest easy in your fortified bunker, knowing that when nuclear war breaks out, you can play Fallout as long as you have power.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Smaller Defender versions, such as the iPad and booster sizes, are designed to attenuate EMP as well as some cell reception/tracking - depending on your location. </strong>However, touch-screens based on electrical conductivity (like Apple products) will not work as our shields block current. Voice commands and wireless Internet still work.</p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Why You Need It</span></strong><br/><br/><strong>Privacy Protection</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Electronic surveillance now everywhere.</li>
<li>Phone GPS tracks your location.</li>
<li>Phones can record/send all nearby conversations without your knowledge.</li>
<li>Blocking reception prevents transmission of conversation or GPS data.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>EMP Defense</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A terrorist detonating a nuclear device in the upper atmosphere can generate an EMP to destroy or shut down most electronics in the continental US.</li>
<li>Transportation, telecommunications, utilities, and food production would all fail.</li>
<li>Former Speaker Gingrich asserted that ""We could lose 90% of the population if an EMP only hit the US."" <strong>It would be the greatest disaster in history. </strong>
</li>
<li>Our product, combined with renewable power, can help you protect your own way of life from going dark.</li>
<li>If products like these are commonplace, we can stop EMP’s from disrupting society.</li>
<li>This is just the beginning of our goal of preventing an EMP assault on the US.</li>
<li>For more information, read the 2008 Congressional Report on EMP at <a href=""http://www.empcommission.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.empcommission.org/</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">How it Works</span></strong><br/><br/><strong>Our products are <em>Faraday cages</em> - continuous metal barriers that block radio waves. For a detailed explanation, see <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faraday_cage"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faraday_cage</a>.<br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>We only need to block the target range of mHz to 10 gHz that can damage your electronics.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Lower frequencies can damage but are slow - letting your electronics redirect the energy.</li>
<li>Higher frequencies can surge past protection - but do not have the energy to damage.</li>
<li>EMP can surge and damage - if enough energy actually gets to your electronics.</li>
<li><strong>Our shields block approx. 75-80 decibels (dB) centered at 10 mHz – reducing voltage by 99.99%.</strong></li>
<li>Most complex electronics have EMI shielding that then can block the remainder.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The cell phone variant is specially coated to block a wider array of frequencies as well as block even more energy vs. the laptop version, as the coating is effectively an additional layer of protection. This is how we achieve such a strong signal reduction to stop your cell phone from connecting or broadcasting.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Although the laptop product looks simple, it overcomes a number of technical challenges, some of them contradictory. </strong>For a laptop to function with this shield, the shield must meet the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>Must be a Faraday cage ideally with no openings but must vent electronics heat – usually done with openings.</li>
<li>Must be thin enough to type through but thick enough to withstand stress.</li>
<li>Must block RF energy but not higher frequencies like WiFi – allowing full functionality including wireless mice and the Internet.</li>
<li>Must be sealed at the bag opening tightly without leaking RF energy but remain resealable over time.</li>
<li>Must be metallic to block energy but act like fabric.</li>
<li>Must be solid but transparent.</li>
<li>Must be inexpensive compared to pricier (thousands of dollars) alternatives but offer superior functionality and portability.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>As you can see, creating it was not an easy process and required significant development.</strong></p>

Hardened electronic equipment – rough and tough, but expensive - $5-15K each! You can save 99% of your money while getting 99% of the effectiveness!
Shielded rooms – immobile and still expensive - may also require specialized A/C.
Small Faraday cages – cheap, but you have to choose between putting your laptop in a metal box or using it - and you probably won’t know when an EMP will hit.

Our Defender provides military level usability and protection for under $90 – the best of all worlds. As with all cheaper solutions, no outside connections can be used, but future upgrade kits will filter connections in/out of the shield, making it the ideal low-cost solution You can now rest easy in your fortified bunker, knowing that when nuclear war breaks out, you can play Fallout as long as you have power.
Smaller Defender versions, such as the iPad and booster sizes, are designed to attenuate EMP as well as some cell reception/tracking - depending on your location. However, touch-screens based on electrical conductivity (like Apple products) will not work as our shields block current. Voice commands and wireless Internet still work.
Why You Need ItPrivacy Protection

Electronic surveillance now everywhere.
Phone GPS tracks your location.
Phones can record/send all nearby conversations without your knowledge.
Blocking reception prevents transmission of conversation or GPS data.

EMP Defense

A terrorist detonating a nuclear device in the upper atmosphere can generate an EMP to destroy or shut down most electronics in the continental US.
Transportation, telecommunications, utilities, and food production would all fail.
Former Speaker Gingrich asserted that ""We could lose 90% of the population if an EMP only hit the US."" It would be the greatest disaster in history. 

Our product, combined with renewable power, can help you protect your own way of life from going dark.
If products like these are commonplace, we can stop EMP’s from disrupting society.
This is just the beginning of our goal of preventing an EMP assault on the US.
For more information, read the 2008 Congressional Report on EMP at http://www.empcommission.org/


How it WorksOur products are Faraday cages - continuous metal barriers that block radio waves. For a detailed explanation, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faraday_cage.
We only need to block the target range of mHz to 10 gHz that can damage your electronics.

Lower frequencies can damage but are slow - letting your electronics redirect the energy.
Higher frequencies can surge past protection - but do not have the energy to damage.
EMP can surge and damage - if enough energy actually gets to your electronics.
Our shields block approx. 75-80 decibels (dB) centered at 10 mHz – reducing voltage by 99.99%.
Most complex electronics have EMI shielding that then can block the remainder.

The cell phone variant is specially coated to block a wider array of frequencies as well as block even more energy vs. the laptop version, as the coating is effectively an additional layer of protection. This is how we achieve such a strong signal reduction to stop your cell phone from connecting or broadcasting.
Although the laptop product looks simple, it overcomes a number of technical challenges, some of them contradictory. For a laptop to function with this shield, the shield must meet the following criteria:

Must be a Faraday cage ideally with no openings but must vent electronics heat – usually done with openings.
Must be thin enough to type through but thick enough to withstand stress.
Must block RF energy but not higher frequencies like WiFi – allowing full functionality including wireless mice and the Internet.
Must be sealed at the bag opening tightly without leaking RF energy but remain resealable over time.
Must be metallic to block energy but act like fabric.
Must be solid but transparent.
Must be inexpensive compared to pricier (thousands of dollars) alternatives but offer superior functionality and portability.

As you can see, creating it was not an easy process and required significant development.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi, my name is Sebastian Lavender and I am developing an app for Ubuntu Touch and Ubuntu Desktop OS. The app itself is a detailed system information panel with a task manager style intergration displaying cpu usage, ram usage etc. The aim for this app is to have it fully convergant so that it loads up on the Ubuntu Touch OS and full Ubuntu OS when docked. I currently don't have enough funds of my own to donate towards the Ubuntu Edge project to get a phone so this is where you guys can come in and help :)</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I am looking to make enough to purchase a Ubuntu Edge phone on their indiegogo project. So for this I am hoping to raise $830 dollars. As all the money will be going there you are helping out not just one project (mine) but also another (the Ubuntu Edge one).</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>So there are two positive impacts that this project will have. One is that it will help me make my app to its maximum ability and have a device with full convergence which I can test it on. Secondly all the money that you donate will actually be going towards the Ubuntu Edge project so will help make it possible.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't afford to donate as I know money is hard, please feel free to spread the word and help me reach this goal!</p>

What PremoBox can be used forAside it is usable as normal PC (Office automation, web navigation, etc) the best use is for advanced features: access point, wifi repeater, mesh node, amule/torrent station, web anonymizer, firewall, etc. Presence of 5 usb port allows you to add more hardware: external memory (read: usb hard disk), wifi/bluetooth dongles, etc.NOTE: PBCT (PremoBox Configuration Tool) is available to easily configure everything into Premobox, it can work in CLI (command Line Interface), using web or ncurses frontend. No ""geek"" knowledge is required to final user.Why we need your helpAt the moment only few pieces was handmade and are ready for you. PremoBox team is a small Team and if we want to make the cost of PremoBox go down, we must make a lot of boxes in one time. Get your PremoBox, spread voice around and make people to know us.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h1>The Idea.</h1>
<p>We all have loved ones who are action sport junkies. They ride motorcycles, race bicycles, or rip down the slopes - heck, that's us! And, despite our mom's very specific instructions, we don't always go in pairs. Every so often, we take a spill that leaves us thinking ""What if I was alone, and was injured more seriously?"" Then we brush ourselves off and go right back at it.</p>
<p>Luckily, Biju Thomas opted to write down his idea and engage his friend, Dr. Tim Bauer (always nice to have a PhD buddy when you have a big idea). The two developed what has become the first personal crash sensor. Not just any crash either. This isn't for dropping your helmet or brushing a limb on the mountain - this is for serious head impacts.</p>
<div class=""template asset"">
<img alt=""The sensor mounts onto any helmet as an aftermarket device."" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/472906/pictures/full/20121003144419-helmet-sensors_04.jpg?1349300666"" src="""" style=""""/><em>The sensor mounts onto any helmet as an aftermarket device.</em>

<h1>How It Works.</h1>
<p>By pairing impact detection technology with the existing <a href=""http://icedot.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ICEdot service</a>, we've been able to create a complete system that detects your most severe crashes, triggers your smart phone to notify your emergency contacts, and displays your emergency medical information. This helps first responders provide fast, accurate treatment. We also let you save and share the data of your crash – creating the world's first lie detector for your wipe outs.</p>
<p>The Crash Sensor pairs with your phone and is managed by the ICEdot Crash Sensor app. If the sensors detect an impact severe enough to exceed safe levels, your phone sounds an alarm and begins an emergency countdown.</p>
<div class=""template asset"">
<img alt=""If you don't disable the countdown, the app displays your emergency profile and notifies your emergency contacts."" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/470948/pictures/full/20121002135748-app01.jpg?1349211471"" src="""" style=""""/><em>If you don't disable the countdown, the app displays your emergency profile and notifies your emergency contacts.</em>
</div>
<p>You can disable the countdown (you can set the count down to a user defined length) if you don’t need assistance. However, if the countdown is not disabled (you may be injured or unconscious), then the app triggers an emergency notification, notifying your emergency contacts, (via text, email, or both) and providing them your GPS location.</p>
<p>By providing your GPS location and emergency profile, first responders have immediate access to your important medical information when you need it most.</p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<h1>What We Need.</h1>
<p>We’ve gone through several prototypes to reduce size and power limitations, and now have it near production form. A few months ago, we made the decision to switch to low-energy Bluetooth (BLE), and now have a working prototype using BLE.</p>
<p>We need you to help us take the Crash Sensor from working prototype to final production unit, help us cover production tooling, and expand the app out across multiple mobile platforms.</p>
<p>We need your help. Please review the funding levels, find one that suits you, and commit. You just might save a life.<br/><br/></p>

<p>Pokémon Go finaly made our childhood dream a reality. Now we finaly have the opportunity to go out in the world and catch 'em all! The only thing we are missing now is the real life Pokédex.<br/><br/>The response have been enormous when we have pitched the idea in closed forums.

We are looking for the perfect size/weight distribution, and still fit the batteries. The final prototype will be ready 2 weeks in to the campaign. Updates will follow as we reaches our milestones.If we reach our funding goal, we will start the process of massproducing the casing right away.See the perks-section to find out how you can get first in line.

Response so far
Pokémon Go finaly made our childhood dream a reality. Now we finaly have the opportunity to go out in the world and catch 'em all! The only thing we are missing now is the real life Pokédex.The response have been enormous when we have pitched the idea in closed forums. We are  now finally are ready to pitch the idea for the rest of the world! And we hope that the response from all of you will be as good.

Risks & ChallengesThe only big challenge we have left is optimizing the battery capasity within the limits of the casing size and budget. We don't want to charge to much for our product, because we would like it to be available for as many Pokémon fans as possible.We are very optimistic about this now, and there are just a matter of weeks before have placed the last pieces of the puzzle. 
Social media strategyWe do not have a large marketing budget. In addition to backing our project, we will ask you to share our campaign in social media.With captions like: ""Tag a friend who would buy this!""""Take a look at this! Like if you are buying this!""""What a great idea! I'm buying this.""Or anything else you think is suitable for getting the word around.",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>What makes it possible?</h3>
<p>iDevices as well as most other phones and tablets typically only use audio Bluetooth systems such as headphones or headsets. Data transfer is not possible. To get around this I created the iTooth. This little dongle plugs into one of your computer's USB ports and looks like an audio device to your Bluetooth enabled iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch but looks like a standard data Bluetooth device to your computer. For the small amount of data we need to transmit for track-pad use it works quite well.</p>

It is now aimed to be compatible with the Arduino platform &amp; the Raspberry Pi, but we will add more platforms in the future.</p> </div> <div> <h3>Who Is It For?</h3> <p>HardwareCloud was made by makers, for makers. If you are a maker, hacker or electronics hobbyist, you will love using this online service. It will easily adapt with your already existing projects, and in no time you will be able to completely control your projects remotely via our online interface. And because our API is open, you can also develop your own applications that uses our service.</p>
<p>But even if you are just starting with your own DIY projects, you can use HardwareCloud to experiment with connected projects &amp; the Internet of Things. It so easy to use and to set up that it can be a great addition to your projects even if you are a beginner.</p>
<p>HardwareCloud is also great for professionals and small businesses that want to limit their costs when deploying devices that have to be controlled &amp; monitored remotely, such as in agricultural applications.</p>
<p>Also note that HardwareCloud doesn't need any specific hardware: if you have an Arduino board that can connect to the Internet (for example via a WiFi shield), you're good to go. For the Raspberry Pi, you simply need to connect your Pi to the Internet via Ethernet or WiFi.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div>
<h3>What Can You Do With It ?</h3>
<p>The applications of HardwareCloud only depends on your own imagination, but we identified three domains of possible applications: home automation, sensor networks, and robotics.</p><p>The first application is how course home automation. With HardwareCloud, you can create your own home automation dashboard to control your home remotely. You can very easily monitor sensors inside your home, like the temperature &amp; humidity. You can also control lamps remotely, for example to activate your lamps just before coming back home. And using the Raspberry Pi camera module, you can also monitor what's going on in your home. The following animation shows the project in action with a basic home automation project:</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1064030/files/20141202025407-4EACB91C-E2F6-4039-9368-E48C82CBD387-99305-00016286E87AD83C.gif?1417517647"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Then, HardwareCloud is also great to monitor sensor networks. For example, you have several Arduino-based sensors deployed in a building, and you want to monitor them remotely. This is really easy to do with HardwareCloud. And because it works both ways, you can also acts on the environment based on the monitored data.</p><p>Finally, HardwareCloud is also reactive enough to be a great companion for your robots &amp; drones projects. You can for example plug an Arduino board with WiFi to your mobile robot, connect it to HardwareCloud, and start moving it around from anywhere in the world. The following animation shows a basic control a mobile robot based on Arduino:</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1063946/files/20141202021316-8E7DFBC0-0DE6-4C54-8C28-143D87A7C9FC-99305-0001602D8F0263C5.gif?1417515196"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>How Does It Work?</h3> <p>Using HardwareCloud is really simple. You simply need to create a new device in the app interface, download the corresponding code from our servers, and modify this code with your own settings (for example your WiFi name and password in case you are using WiFi).</p><p>Then, upload the code to your device, and you are done. You will then see that the device will be accessible from your Devices page, and you can then control them directly as shown in the following animation:</p><p></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1063661/files/20141202001408-451525FD-8E3F-4A0E-BF00-04C9E9DB821C-99305-000158F2FFE9898B.gif?1417508048"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>The other thing you can do based on your devices is to create what we call Dashboards. Dashboards can integrate several devices in the same page, so you can control them on a higher level. You can for example have a Dashboard for your whole home that integrates several Arduino boards.</p><p>As an example, the following animation shows the creation of a simple Dashboard dedicated to home automation:</p><p></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1063662/files/20141202001438-E648707E-A127-4927-AC9C-5F575D891089-99305-000159921C9E4B65.gif?1417508078"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Why Is It Better Than Other Solutions?</h3>
<p>HardwareCloud is better than already existing solutions on several points. The most important feature being that it works both ways. Let's see what this means. Many other services allows you to send data from a board to the cloud, and monitor this data remotely. HardwareCloud however also allows you to control your devices and act on their environment, for example to switch on a lamp or move a robot around.</p><p>HardwareCloud is also multi-platform at heart: you can use it from any computer or mobile device as it is a web application, and it also supports multiple devices that you can control, like Arduino and the Raspberry Pi.</p><p>HardwareCloud also features a beautiful REST API, so it is really easy to develop your own applications based on our service.</p><p></p><h3>What Do You Get For Supporting The Project?</h3><p>If you support the development of HardwareCloud, you will get one year of subscription to our service with the plan of your choice, depending on which perk you selected to support us.</p><p>Your money will be used to finish the development of the application, and later to support the maintenance &amp; future updates of the application. We put a monthly subscription model in place to pay for the hosting of the online application, plus the maintenance costs &amp; development of new features in the future. However, the API itself is and will remain open-source.</p>
<h3>What Is Already Done.</h3>
<p>HardwareCloud is currently in development, and the core features of the application are already done. You can for example already control Arduino boards &amp; Raspberry Pi's from anywhere in the world, and integrate them into dashboards.</p>
<p>The devices part is fully functional, and it's really easy to add a new device or delete an existing device from an account. You can also already configure and modify your dashboards for various applications.</p>
<h3>What Still Needs To Be Done.</h3>
<p>The funds from this campaign will be used to make the application usable by all and to improve HardwareCloud on three main points: user experience, security, and automation.</p>
<p>The first point that needs to be improved is the user experience. First, we need to make it easier to add/delete devices &amp; dashboards. We want to integrate a drag &amp; drop system for the dashboards so they will be even easier to build. We also need to make it easier to configure your devices once you downloaded the software or Arduino sketch from the HardwareCloud interface.</p>
<p>Then, we will also focus on the security aspect. Nobody wants their garage door opened by somebody else from the web, and we take security aspects very seriously for this application. We need funds to improve the security of the application and to make sure that your devices can be controlled by you and you only. </p>
<p>Finally, we also want to make the user experience by proposing some automation feature to the application. For example, you would like to automatically send you an alert when motion is detected in your home, even if you are not looking at the application on your mobile device. Or you want to activate a pump automatically when the measured humidity of a soil is getting low.</p><p></p><h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3><p></p><ul>
<li>
<b>What is a 'device' in the different plans available?</b><br/>A device is a given board you connect to HardwareCloud: it can be an Arduino board (Uno/Due/Micro/etc) or a Raspberry Pi.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>What about Bluetooth, ZigBee or RF devices? Can I also connect them to HardwareCloud?</b><br/>This is a feature planned in the development of the application after this campaign. You will be able to connect these devices to a 'Hub' that will be connected to HardwareCloud via WiFi or Ethernet.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Will I be able to define triggers, for example to automatically activate a heater when the measured temperature falls below a given value?</b><br/>This is also a feature we want to integrate in the application after the campaign is over, so it will be no problem to create such triggers.</li>
</ul>

You will then see that the device will be accessible from your Devices page, and you can then control them directly as shown in the following animation:The other thing you can do based on your devices is to create what we call Dashboards. Dashboards can integrate several devices in the same page, so you can control them on a higher level. You can for example have a Dashboard for your whole home that integrates several Arduino boards.As an example, the following animation shows the creation of a simple Dashboard dedicated to home automation:

Why Is It Better Than Other Solutions?
HardwareCloud is better than already existing solutions on several points. The most important feature being that it works both ways. Let's see what this means. Many other services allows you to send data from a board to the cloud, and monitor this data remotely. HardwareCloud however also allows you to control your devices and act on their environment, for example to switch on a lamp or move a robot around.HardwareCloud is also multi-platform at heart: you can use it from any computer or mobile device as it is a web application, and it also supports multiple devices that you can control, like Arduino and the Raspberry Pi.HardwareCloud also features a beautiful REST API, so it is really easy to develop your own applications based on our service.What Do You Get For Supporting The Project?If you support the development of HardwareCloud, you will get one year of subscription to our service with the plan of your choice, depending on which perk you selected to support us.Your money will be used to finish the development of the application, and later to support the maintenance & future updates of the application. We put a monthly subscription model in place to pay for the hosting of the online application, plus the maintenance costs & development of new features in the future. However, the API itself is and will remain open-source.
What Is Already Done.
HardwareCloud is currently in development, and the core features of the application are already done. You can for example already control Arduino boards & Raspberry Pi's from anywhere in the world, and integrate them into dashboards.
The devices part is fully functional, and it's really easy to add a new device or delete an existing device from an account. You can also already configure and modify your dashboards for various applications.
What Still Needs To Be Done.
The funds from this campaign will be used to make the application usable by all and to improve HardwareCloud on three main points: user experience, security, and automation.
The first point that needs to be improved is the user experience. First, we need to make it easier to add/delete devices & dashboards. We want to integrate a drag & drop system for the dashboards so they will be even easier to build. We also need to make it easier to configure your devices once you downloaded the software or Arduino sketch from the HardwareCloud interface.
Then, we will also focus on the security aspect. Nobody wants their garage door opened by somebody else from the web, and we take security aspects very seriously for this application. We need funds to improve the security of the application and to make sure that your devices can be controlled by you and you only. 
Finally, we also want to make the user experience by proposing some automation feature to the application. For example, you would like to automatically send you an alert when motion is detected in your home, even if you are not looking at the application on your mobile device. Or you want to activate a pump automatically when the measured humidity of a soil is getting low.Frequently Asked Questions

What is a 'device' in the different plans available?A device is a given board you connect to HardwareCloud: it can be an Arduino board (Uno/Due/Micro/etc) or a Raspberry Pi.


What about Bluetooth, ZigBee or RF devices? Can I also connect them to HardwareCloud?This is a feature planned in the development of the application after this campaign. You will be able to connect these devices to a 'Hub' that will be connected to HardwareCloud via WiFi or Ethernet.


Will I be able to define triggers, for example to automatically activate a heater when the measured temperature falls below a given value?This is also a feature we want to integrate in the application after the campaign is over, so it will be no problem to create such triggers.

<p><strong>PROTECT</strong> young children from leaving the house without your knowledge. If you are a caregiver for an elderly with dementia, our <strong>DOOR ALARM</strong> will notify you whenever the door is opened. The door alarm also activates if anyone enters from the outside.</p>
<p>This <strong>PORTABLE</strong> door knob alarm is powered by a 9 volt battery and will attach to any knob or handle in the world in seconds. Nothing drains the battery until the siren is sounding.</p>
<p>Our mission is to protect <strong>TODDLERS</strong>, <strong>ELDERLY</strong> and other ""<strong>WANDERERS</strong>"" and deter intruders with an alarm that activates when the door knob is turned.</p>
<p>The <strong>ON-OFF</strong> switch is for general security to keep intruders out.</p>
<p>The <strong>KEYED</strong> switch will keep intruders out and keep ""wanderers"" from leaving, because it cannot be turned off without the key. The caregiver keeps control of the key.</p>
<p><strong>YOUR SUPPORT</strong> will protect toddlers and other wanderers in families who CANNOT AFFORD the high monthly alarm monitoring fees. This alarm has <strong>NO MONTHLY MONITORING FEES</strong>.</p>
<p>I was born on a small farm in Pennsylvania. During college, I earned an Associate's Degree in Electronic Systems Technology and gained 40+ years experience in prototyping, troubleshooting and repair.</p>
<p>The need for these alarms surfaced when my mother developed dementia and we worried that she would wander off. When dad started using these alarms, mom resented the idea. When we explained that it was a home security system, she liked the idea.</p>
<p>It is important that we get the word out to people who will benefit from these alarms. That is where I need your support. The money will be used to purchace infomercials and equipment. This will cost a minimum of $35,000.</p>
<p>The manufacturing process is flowchated, time studies are complete, vendors are waiting for orders and the distribution channels are ready. I believe all problems that could delay this project have been addressed and I am confident that we can deliver in a timely manner.</p>

<p><strong>The Chrono Case is the only iPhone case you will ever need.</strong> It’s a sleek and premium case that features unique functionality to improve your iPhone experience and everyday life.</p>
<p>iPhones have revolutionized and evolved to be a major part of our everyday lifestyle. It’s our own little personal device that allows us to multitask. From texting, emailing, taking photos, watching videos, and playing games, it can all be done on the go or even laying down. But how often do you get tired of holding your phone while watching videos? Or accidentally dropping your phone when you or texting? Or even taken blurry photos just because you had to reach for the snapshot button?</p>
<p>With the Chrono Case, that will no longer be a problem. It features a clever elastic strap system that is designed to assist when you are multitasking and can also secure your everyday items. The case is fully covered in aluminum and crafted together like a fine timepiece. It’s designed to be the most sleek and functional case out there without any of the cost and production limitations.</p>
<p> </p>
<h1>The Advantages</h1>
<p>The case is used in many ways. As an everyday user, either you are on the go, taking pictures, or lying in bed, the sliders are designed to move diagonally, so you can multi task without the fear of dropping your phone.</p>

<h1>The Design</h1>
<p>The final product will be carefully crafted and pieced together like a fine watch.

</h3>Ths podcast will not just cover gadgets and robotics, but any technology that's of interest to my listeners and I. You will be able to download and listen to my podcasts at your leisure. Soon after funding is completed, you will also be able to listen live, and interact while the podcast is happening.

<p>This will be a journey we will go on together!<br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <ul>
<li>I'm asking for $1500.00 in funding to purchase equipment and software to allow me to properly launch this podcast. This will consist of a new microphone, a computer upgrade, and software for audio recording, editing, and post processing. To start, I'll be doing all the recording, editing, and post production myself. </li>
<li>This will not be a sponsored podcast, so it will be driven entirely by myself and my listeners/viewers. This funding is needed to get things setup properly, so I can produce a top quality podcast.</li>
<li>After the audio only podcast has been going for awhile, I want to add a video net cast along side it, where I'll actually record my experiences as I tinker and build new projects. You will be able to follow along live at some point, after the net cast has been on for awhile!<br/>
</li>
<li>If this podcast is not fully funded, it will not happen, and I will not get any money at all.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will get a high quality, weekly, audio (with video to be added) podcast, without advertising, that will keep you coming back for more!<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>I want to reach out to more people, especially young people, and share what I know and do with everyone. The idea is for us all to have FUN learning and tinkering with technology of all kinds!<br/></p> <ul>
<li>I have always enjoyed sharing what I know and do, so this podcast is just a natural extension of what I'm already doing.</li>
<li>I am very active on app.net (@hybotics) and also have a Twitter account (@hybotics).  I never stop sharing what I know and do with others.<br/>
</li>
<li>I've been thinking about this for a long time, and feel now is the right time to bring this to reality.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Stretch Goals<br/>
</h3>1) If this campaign reaches $3500.00, I will purchase a nice 3D Printer, with the Dual Extruder option (<a href=""http://bootsindustries.com/shop/biv2/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://bootsindustries.com/shop/biv2/</a>) that allows printing in two different colors at the same time. This will allow me to create and do much more interesting and better looking projects, as well as create and make custom parts for my robots. This is not the most expensive 3D Printer, but I believe it is the best, and has the most features, for the money. This extra money will also cover paying for one year of maintenance for my 3D CAD software, which will interface to the 3D Printer.<br/><p></p>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> I have several years of experience in audio and video recording and production, so I feel I am qualified to produce a quality podcast. I've been tinkering with technology since 1973, and have a passion and thirst for new things, electronics, robotics, technology, learning, and tinkering.<br/></p> <ul>
<li>The only real risk here, is that I might not be able to deliver this podcast for some unexpected reason, in the time frame I am shooting for. There can always be unexpected issues that could delay things. I'm in this to make it happen, and I'm not going to let obstacles get in my way.<br/>
</li>
<li>I've thought through everything as much as possible, and am confident in my ability to deliver what I've promised.<br/>
</li>
<li>I have all the abilities and capabilities I need to overcome any obstacles that might pop up in the path of making this podcast a reality, and am committed 110% to making it happen.</li>
<li>I have experience recording, editing, and doing post production on audio and video.<br/>

Made for New MacBook Pro & all iOS, Android, and Windows devices with all types of plugs.  How to use it?

 
Got a new MacBook, but flash drive doesn't work. When you want to seize the moment, but your phone is running out of storage. Can't share files between devices. It's unsafe to keep your files on cloud, and transition takes too much time. Different devices have different ports, there's no universal connector that fits all devices.​ EZ’s proprietary 4-IN-1 port design makes it the sole USB flash drive that has ever existed which integrates four commonly used connectors including Type-C, Lightning, Micro-USB, and USB. It pretty much has all of your electronic devices covered, from new MacBook Pro, Macs, PC, iPhone, iPad, iPod touch devices, to Android and Windows smart phones and tablets. EZ is equipped with a Type-C plug on one end, and a standard USB plug on the other. The uniqueness lies in the USB plug, which can be converted into a single connector that can pop right into both Lightning and Micro-USB ports on your devices. Transfer photo albums, music libraries, video collections, and work or school papers -it's never been easier! Excited to buy the New MacBook Pro? The headache starts when we need to move movies, photos, music and large files quickly and safely from or to our New MacBook Pro because of the new Type-C plug. Now with this flash drive, it’s not a problem anymore. Connect your new MacBook Pro to iPhones, iPads, iPods, MacBooks, and Android devices - Samsung, HTC, LG, Nokia, and Windows smart phones and tablets. EZ, the world’s first and currently the only USB flash drive with integrated all commonly used connectors integrated- Lightning, Micro USB, Type-C and USBs. Say Goodbye to Wi-Fi and cloud storage services like Dropbox and Google Drive. With EZ, file storage and transfer has never been this easy and fast. You will never again get worried about the storage of your smartphone. Plug EZ to your smartphone and the storage space will be instantly  expanded. EZ comes with three different memory sizes of 32GB/64GB/128GB to extend data storage capacity of your smart phones or tablets for up to 128 GB. That's a huge collection of multimedia files, and it’s very cost-effective as well, considering the money you saved on purchasing a smart phone with large capacity, or the recurring fees for cloud storage services.With the EZ ultra portable thumb drive, it will never be a hassle again when someone asks you to share a song, a picture or a video even when there is no internet connection. You do not need to use any cables to go back and forth. It’s a real timesaver, which makes it so easy to move the files around among people with literally all types of devices.

 
Plug and edit your files directly from the EZ USB flash drive without requiring them first to be copied onto your device. You can even zip/unzip the files stored on EZ. Featuring high-performance USB, EZ can read and write files at a super fast speed. It also features a document reader that supports all common data formats, including: Isn’t it frustrating when you see the “out of space” notification while taking memorable photos, or recording important videos/audios? Well, with EZ, you will never find yourself low on space ever again. Simply leave it plugged into your devices while taking photos or recording audio/video, and the content will be automatically saved to EZ. Despite the fact that it will quickly free up memory on your device through seamless transfer of large files like the audio/video you record, you can also stream them directly off EZ on your device without any glitching, slowing, or stuttering. Playback your favorite movie and music wirelessly when traveling. Available from the Apple Store, the AGP App lets you easily view, access, manage (copy, save, clone, download, store and back up) all the files and share them on social media from your iPhone and iPad. Its navigation on other mobile devices and PCs is also very simple and straightforward.Download and install the AGP App with one press of a button. Easily import and export files. Manage from your smartphone easily.
 Switch between different colors and styles of operation interfaces.
EZ offers a reliable way to pass data among devices that aren’t network-connected, plus three protective measures to safeguard the data stored on it, which make it much securer than using a network connection like transferring through the cloud which leaves a ghost footprint of private information out there in the wild.

<p>No microcontroller is necessary. Run it as a standalone board  to create your own wireless router, learn about embedded Linux development, use it as a base for your network connected sensors or anything else you can envision.</p>
<h3>About the Hardware</h3>
<p>The Arbor Linux Shield is an Atheros AR9331 MIPS based system on module running at 400 MHz with 64 MB DDR2 RAM and 16 MB SPI flash memory. The shield board contains a USB hub with a micro SD controller for up to 32 GB of extra filesystem storage. There are 11 GPIO pins (three of which are used for programming an Arduino).</p>
<p>There are also two additional USB 2.0 ports and two additional switched ethernet ports that can be added from header pins. The shield board can be powered from the micro USB connector on the back or by a connected microcontroller.</p>
<p>The board is low profile.  It has no components sticking out above the standard-sized Arduino shield headers.  This makes things easier when stacking on additional shields or inserting the device into an enclosure.</p>

<h3><strong>The BASS Dock </strong></h3>
<p>Everyone who listens to music, watches video, or even uses speakerphone on their iPhone knows that the native speaker just doesn't cut it. iPhone users need to buy external speakers to get acceptable audio performance, it's just a fact.</p>
<p><em>Until now.</em> BASS is a polycarbonate dock that amplifies your iPhone's native speaker passively, with no electronics at all. <strong>Boasting an impressive 15 decibel boost, BASS makes your iPhone's native speaker useful again.</strong> BASS even lets you insert the charging cord you already own, so you never have to worry about running out of power.</p>

<h3><strong>Video</strong></h3>

looked for a gadget to prop up your phone in your office, in a classroom, in a coffee shop, in a restaurant, in your kitchen, or even in your bed, but couldn't find one that works well? Have you looked for a phone grip that does not harm the beauty of your phones and allows you to relax your hands while holding your phones in a long commute or in the waiting room of a clinic? Look no further! We have a perfect solution for you!
INTRODUCING:
 
 

UGRIP is a patented fashionable phone stand and grip that could prop up your phone in any orientations and any viewing angles, and is also the only grip in the world that is adhesive-free and can be easily attached or detached. 
 

 
 

 
MICRO-SUCTION CUPS TECHNOLOGY
UGRIP uses thousands of micro-suction cups to render unparalleled functionalities.​ ​ 
 

 
STAND MODE
UGRIP is the only portable phone stand in the world that allows users to easily prop up their phones in portrait or landscape orientation, and freely adjust the viewing angle. Unlike many bulky and heavy existing phone stands, that use brute force to hold phones, or stands made of flimsy plastics, UGRIP uses the friction force generated by the micro-suction cups to hold the phone in place. 

 


 
Landscape viewing at any preferred angle: 
UGRIP ADVANTAGE: In stand mode, none of the existing phone grips and phone stands allow users to adjust viewing angles of their phones in the landscape orientation so easily. 
 

Super Stand in Action
Only the UGRIP phone stand can do this!

<p dir=""ltr"">The iStick Playtime instantly answers your calls, controls your music, messages, and sports stats without ever having to reach for your phone or slowing down to activate a function.  You can also activate Siri/Android voice command to undertake a number of audio-tasks or start your Dew Motion App, by simply stating: “Start my run”,for example.</p>

<h2><strong>Why Indiegogo?</strong></h2>
<p>After a year of development, we are proud to announce that the iStick Playtime is ready to move into its production and accreditation phase.  We have all the suppliers lined up and ready to run!  </p>
<p>indiegogo allows us to engage with our early adopters at this critical phase of our project.  Making sure that we are designing what our core users want from the iStick Playtime and making them part of the decision making process.  This is why we need your help. To build the ultimate smart watch for sports and fitness!</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Where will the funds go?</h2>
<p>We need $250,000 to get the product from its current prototype state to its commercial state.  The costs include software programming, apps development, product certifications, licenses and minimum product inventory.  Since the electronics we are using are new to the market, there are high minimum levels required from our part suppliers. All of these factors make the first batch of products very costly to produce.  This is why we need your help.</p>

Ready to Play!
More than a watch, the iStick Playtime syncs to your smart phone directly via Bluetooth. The iStick controls your smart phone’s functions and displays its vital information right onto the iStick’s display.

What it Does
The iStick Playtime instantly answers your calls, controls your music, messages, and sports stats without ever having to reach for your phone or slowing down to activate a function.  You can also activate Siri/Android voice command to undertake a number of audio-tasks or start your Dew Motion App, by simply stating: “Start my run”,for example.
 

See all of your stats without scrolling
The flexible e-ink display allows us to position the screen around the wrist rather than straight on top of it. This results in a bigger screen size and right view angle so that you can easily see your time, messages, and sports stats even in full sunlight. It also uses 50% less energy than common LCD screens.
 

Siri and Android Voice Command
With its embedded microphone and speaker, answer calls on the mountain, initiate Siri to command your music, listen to or reply to a text message by simply activating your iStick Playtime.

 
Weather-proof
Take it into cold, snow, water and rain.  The iStick Playtime is good to operate down to 15 degrees F (-10 C) and is waterproof.  So take it in the snow, down rapids, or anywhere else your passions will take you.

iStick moves at the speed you do
Through its innovative joystick controller, you can quickly activate all of your phone’s functions at full speed, even with a glove on. Don’t let your phone slow you down.

Wear it how you choose.
Skiing, snowboarding, running, biking, cycling, kayaking, swimming, kite surfing, hiking, motor biking and the list goes on and on. Wear in on your wrist, on your arm, on top of your jacket, or on your handle bars.

François provides our company with product development services specially in regards to thermo binding and laser cutting assembly of the product.
 
Why Indiegogo?
After a year of development, we are proud to announce that the iStick Playtime is ready to move into its production and accreditation phase.  We have all the suppliers lined up and ready to run!  
indiegogo allows us to engage with our early adopters at this critical phase of our project.  Making sure that we are designing what our core users want from the iStick Playtime and making them part of the decision making process.  This is why we need your help. To build the ultimate smart watch for sports and fitness!
 
Where will the funds go?
We need $250,000 to get the product from its current prototype state to its commercial state.  The costs include software programming, apps development, product certifications, licenses and minimum product inventory.  Since the electronics we are using are new to the market, there are high minimum levels required from our part suppliers. All of these factors make the first batch of products very costly to produce.  This is why we need your help.
 
What are the risks and challenges associated with the project?
While our company has successfully brought to market a first generation of iStick armbands for iPhone using flexible electronic components with less than 3% product return rate over three years, every new project contains a number of risks and challenges:
Challenges:
There exists no product on the market using the prescribed flexible electronic components within a textile material. We are the first to pioneer in this direction which does represent the challenge of working in uncharted territory.  This is what makes this exciting and why we need your help!
Risk:
Indiegogo customer should be aware that there exists a gap between a prototype version of a product and a production unit. While we have undergone a thorough engineering feasibility regarding the production of the unit, there may be some unforeseen elements that may affect its development.  If these should arise, we will communicate with you.
In manufacturing our product, we are relying on a number of suppliers for parts and final assembly.  Delays in the delivery of a part or defects attributed to a part can delay the estimated delivery date of the product.
Also, there are a number of certifications and licenses which we must obtain to have the product ready for retail.  While we have dealt with Apple licenses and other certifications for our other products, there are always uncertainties as to the time frames associated with obtaining final accreditations from these authorities.
Understanding these risks is an important part of making your decision on this Project. We will do our best to promptly answer to any of your concerns.",11.0,0,"1 Campaign

WirelessUsing the latest Bluetooth Low Energy 4.0 technology, BluCub has a range of up to 50m (160 feet) depending on its surrounding environment.









Humidity SensorMeasures Relative Humidity between 0% and 100%. Keep mold, flu, viruses and bugs away from your home.









Temperature SensorMeasures Ambient Temperature between -20°C and +50°C. Be healthier and save money with the right temperature for every room and every season. 









Battery Life3 Year Battery Life. And it's replaceable too!









SizeMeasuring only 50 x 50 x 20 mm, it fits nicely in your pocket.









More is BetterUse as many BluCubs as you like to isolate your problem spots.



			 



Quite simply:



BluCub transmits humidity and temperature data every 10 seconds to your mobile device. Once switched on, BluCub can run for up to 3 years 'chirping' away every 10 seconds. This allows you to simply run the app when you want to know what the humidity and temperature is of your environment. 

			 

			 




Accurately shows you the conditions of your environment.


Helps reduce your energy bills


Allows you to check if your home improvements are working effectively


Can be moved and placed anywhere to find problem spots


Here are some of the uses for BluCub:



Ensuring proper indoor humidity has important skin allergen and other health benefits by inhibiting the growth of mold, bacteria, viruses, fungi, mites and other asthma inducing agents.

Reduce your energy bills by avoiding over-heating in winter and over-cooling in the summer and managing the settings in every room more accurately with BluCub. 

			 



Not sure about the conditions outside when you are getting ready to go out?

Put BluCub outside and get this information immediately. 

			 



Young children and elderly are more sensitive to environment changes. Help your baby sleep safe and sound by managing the temperature (16°C-20°C) and humidity (30%- 60%) in the room.

Use BluCub to check these accurately in your baby’s cot or bed. 

			 



Typical fridge temperature should be between 3°C and 5°C and freezer temperature -18°C. 

Use BluCub to adjust your settings accurately and reduce your energy bills by avoiding over-cooling.

			 



Remember, not all products are equal. Are the controlling measures in your Greenhouse working satisfactorily? 

BluCub will give you this information accurately and can be placed anywhere in your Greenhouse to also check for circulation.

			 



Laziness, skin agitation, dry eyes, asthma are typical problems due to incorrectly set temperature and humidity in buildings. 

Use BluCub to check these in any room at any time. 

			 



The life of your books is affected by the temperature and humidity they are stored in.

Protect against pre-mature aging and rotting by using BluCub to check your storage conditions. 

			 



Teach your children the benefits of managing temperature in your homes to save energy.

Teachers can use BluCub in experiments to show children how the environment changes.

			 



Ensure that perishable food items are always maintained at the proper environmental conditions.

BluCub can be placed with foods to make sure the settings are correct and protect against food poisoning and early expiry of food. 

			 



Remember, not all products to manage storage conditions are equal.

If you have a doubt on the storage conditions of your expensive wines, BluCub can be used to provide accurate humidity and temperature information and help you protect your wines. 

			 



To protect your artwork, ensure temperature variation does not exceed 20°C over a 24 hour period and humidity remains within 20%.

Take spot measurements with BluCub to reassure yourself.



Quality of Cigars is greatly affected by humidity.

Place a BluCub with your equipment to make sure the humidity is between 68% to 72% to protect against tobacco beetles. 

			 



Protect against fungus growth on your lenses by making sure the humidity where you store, is less than 60%.

Put BluCub with your lenses to ensure the conditions are fine. 

			 



Use BluCub as a building inspection tool to make sure the temperature and humidity in ALL parts is correctly set to protect the goods you are storing.

BluCub can also help you determine if the circulation of air is working effectively. 

			 



Monitor server cabinets, rooms, data centres and other mission critical facilities to prevent equipment failure, downtime, loss of revenue and reputation.

Use BluCubs to make measurements at different parts of the cabinet to ensure there is adequate air flow around the equipment and room. 

			 





Here's a summary of the perks we are offering for different levels of support:







			 



















If we raise our base goal target, this is our vision for BluCub:



			 



			BluCub Hardware



The hardware design is complete and fully functional. We are currently testing our prototypes boards extensively so that when BluCub ships, it reaches you in perfect condition!

			BluCub iOS7 App

The BluCub iOS App is also nearly complete. We are working hard on adding more features to make BluCub even more useful for you. Please watch the video below for a complete demonstration of how easy it is to use BluCub.

			 



			 



If you've brought a product to market, you know how the costs pile up. 

We have already invested in the hardware and app development to bring the project so far. 

We are working tight and lean, keeping expenses incredibly low — yet still there are some significant costs that can't be avoided. Here are the primary ones:


Production Tooling


FCC Certification


Production, Assembly & QA Setup


Initial minimum production run


Shipping


Continued App Development - more features


			 



Any new project carries significant risks. Although we have worked hard to minimize the risks, writing software for the Apple App Store always carries the risk of being rejected. Therefore there may be a delay in the release of the BluCub app as we make changes to the meet Apple's requirements.

However, the greatest risk we have, like any new venture, is shortage of funds.

If you like what we are doing and can afford to support us, help us to minimize this risk by supporting BluCub now by clicking on one of these:

We are engineers! 

We have been designing commercial and industrial wireless sensors for businesses for many years.

Most commercial long range sensor networks require a receiver and additional data processing equipment making it too complicated and expensive for consumers. We have always been aware of this limitation and have been actively searching for the right technology to use for an affordable consumer wireless sensing device.

Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) 4.0 technology was on our radar since 2012, but it was really in 2013 that BLE started gaining serious momentum. Smart phones, especially iPhones, accelerated the adoption of BLE support. Nearly everyone is now carrying a receiver in their pocket. The internet of things is becoming a reality and accessible by everyone.

Excited with the technology, we thought it would be really cool if anyone could buy a wireless humidity and temperature device and use a simple app to monitor and manage their environment.

So, as typical engineers do, we set off full steam ahead with our idea to bring an affordable wireless humidity and temperature gadget for you and I. 

We have a strong partnership with our manufacturer to ensure we get a quality, reliable product to you.

And here we are now, asking for your support to bring BluCub to the market.  We have lots of ideas (see our stretch goals for some them) for new features and functionality for BluCub and hope we can get the opportunity to make these a reality with your support. 

Feel absolutely free to contact us with any questions, comments or ideas you may have. We will be grateful for any feedback.

<h3>My mission is to protect toddlers and other ""wanderers"" by producing an alarm that activates BEFORE the door can open. The ON-OFF switch is for general security to keep intruders out. The KEYED switch will keep intruders out and keep ""wanderers"" from leaving. Your support will protect toddlers and other wanderers in families who just don't want to pay those rediculous monthly monitoring fees.</h3>
<p>I have so much faith that you too will see the value in these alarms, that I have opted for an all or nothing campaign. You are my test market and ultimately decide if these alarms will come to market.</p>
<p>Knob Sentry will install on door knobs and handles <strong>anywhere in the world!</strong> They are self-contained and powered by a 9 volt battery. Nothing drains the battery until the siren is sounding.</p>
<p>Best of all, there are <strong>NO MONTHLY MONITORING FEES</strong> and can be purchased one piece at a time until you have the amount of security you desire. After that, there are no more expenses.</p>
<p>I was born on a small farm in Pennsylvania. During college I earned an Associate's Degree in Electronic Systems Technology and gained 40+ years experience in prototyping, troubleshooting and repair. The need for these alarms surfaced when my mother developed dementia and we worried that she would wander off. When dad started using these alarms, mom resented the idea. When we explained that it was a home security system, she liked the idea.</p>
<p>I am at the beginning of this start up business (they are still made on my diningroom table). With sales starting to increase, I need to move into a facility, add employees, purchase some equipment and really start the sales momentum by purchasing infomercials. That is where I need your support. At a minimum that will cost $35,000.</p>
<p>The manufacturing process is flowcharted, the labor force is ready, vendors are waiting for our order and the distribution channels are thought out. I believe all problems that could delay this project have been addressed and I am confident that we can deliver in a timely manner.</p>
<p>Now I don't expect you to do this for nothing. The perks are designed so you get something out of the deal too. What better gift can I give than your safety and security.</p>

</span></span><b></b><p style=""font-size: 17px; font-family: Sans-Serif; line-height: 1.6; margin-bottom: 26px;""><b>1. True multi-user experience</b><br/>Direct interaction with content is just more intuitive. While multi-touch so far has mostly been associated with two-finger operation, multi-touch on TableConnect really opens up new ways of interaction. Keyboard and mouse are a thing of the past. Through TableConnect's huge size, multitouch operation becomes a multiuser experience. <br/><br/><b>2. No learning curve</b><br/>We envisioned TableConnect. A giant multi-touch table that allows you to plug in your smartphone or tablet and use all the apps as if they were on the original device. You don’t need to learn new software, instead you can enjoy the familiar surface of your personal device on a big screen. Simply just Plug &amp; Play<br/><br/><b>3. Save on development costs</b><br/>There are many multi-touch solutions already in use around the world, you might say. But let´s take a closer look here. Most of these solutions rely on proprietary software (and sometimes hardware) that need custom apps, specifically created for their systems. Due to the naturally low infiltration of such devices, the number of available developers is sparse, resulting in more expensive app development costs for apps.<br/>TableConnect on the other hand directly connects to the extensive ecosystem of iOS and Android apps. As a result we believe that custom app development very often will not be necessary at all. And even if you do need a custom app, the development process will definitely be less expensive considering the amount of gifted iOS and Android developers available worldwide.<br/>This circumstance will also be key to see innovative solutions specifically designed for TableConnect in the future.<br/><br/><b>4. A real table after all</b><br/>And last but not least, let´s talk about the design. While almost any other multitouch “table” out there really is just a tv with bolt-on legs and an ugly bezel, TableConnect in contrast is a piece of luxury furniture. Use it as you would use any other table. Sit on it if you want, get work done or eat lunch with your family and colleagues. Because of it´s seamless design there will also be no dust or breadcrumbs trapped in the corners of the screen.<span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""></span></span></p>

We wanted to achieve a product that is more than a technical device. We invested countless hours which led to a timeless, reduced body seamlessly covered with ultra-sturdy glass that secretly contains all the functional buttons and a beautiful 60 inch screen.</p>

Take off one leg to use TableConnect in a vertical position, for example as an interactive display. Put TableConnect on its side to use it in landscape mode, for interactive presentations. Remove all legs to mount TableConnect on every surface. </p></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><p style=""font-size: 17px; font-family: Sans-Serif; line-height: 1.6; margin-bottom: 26px;"">TableConnect’s timeless monolithic design and precise craftsmanship makes it a device built to last.</p>

We developed a fully functional 32 inch proof-of-concept of TableConnect which already assisted in testing new iterations of the software will aid in further development.<br/><br/>To bring TableConnect to the next stage we need your support via this Indiegogo campaign to enable us to progress further and construct a full size 60 inch prototype that will include all the features planned for the final product.<br/><br/>This prototype will also help us to iron out all the hardware and design features and thereby build a platform that will allow us to fine-tune all the software features (like better response time, quick pairing recognition, Smart Areas implementation, etc.) and finally get TableConnect ready for the market.</p>

<p style=""font-size: 17px; font-family: Sans-Serif; line-height: 1.6; margin-bottom: 26px;"">When we first envisioned TableConnect, we made a YouTube demonstration video but didn’t tell anyone that it was an elaborate visual effects fake. News outlets from around the world jumped onto it - Forbes, The Sun, Engadget, Gizmodo - to name only a few. The video jumped to 2 million views within three days and became the most viewed YouTube video in the world on one day. It was crazy.<br/><br/>
  And so was the demand. We received hundreds of buying requests for a product that didn’t exist …people really like what we did here and that was the perfect motivation to start development and team up with some ingenious brains to bring TableConnect to life.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 17px; font-family: Sans-Serif; line-height: 1.6; margin-bottom: 26px;"">We developed the proof-of-concept and came up with a very distinct design for the final product. Now we are at a stage where we are looking for funding to build the 60 inch prototype, our last step before we can enter production and start taking orders for TableConnect.<br/><br/></p>

Three technology whizzes from Austria have been tinkering on a sleek, 52-inch table with a working iPhone interface, including all the multi-touch capabilities.<br/><a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/parmyolson/2010/11/05/meet-the-guys-behind-the-iphone-table/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Forbes</a><br/><br/>THESE gadget boffins have taken their love of iPhones to a new level – by turning theirs into a TABLE.<br/><a href=""http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/3213820/Phone-table-No-its-an-iTable.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Sun</a><br/></p>

And there’s probably hundreds of thousands of folks out there who would agree with that (even if larger screen devices are becomingly increasingly popular), but sometimes you just want to do your photo viewing on something bigger. And not just bigger, but something you can still interact with in the same way you would with your iPhone. Luckily, the 58-inch multitouch table exists, and it’s the real deal.<br/><a href=""http://www.slashgear.com/table-connect-for-iphone-brings-iphones-interface-to-58-inch-multitouch-table-video-02111869/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">slashgear.com</a><br/><br/>The Apple iPhone 4 may be a contender for the Greatest Gadget of the 21st Century, but you can't eat your dinner off it.

  TableConnect will be shipped with a fully pre-configured iOS-Device (iPhone or iPad). The minimum hardware requirement for TableConnect host devices will be an iPhone 4, from the current state of production. All iOS devices need a jailbreak at this stage of development. The availability of jailbreaks for different iOS devices and versions of iOS varies greatly. In general it can be said that as long as a jailbreak is applied, an iOS device will be able to be used with TableConnect. We will provide a detailed list of compatible devices and a manual for configuration.</p>

TableConnect unlocks a new dimension that allows for the use of millions of available apps on a larger scale touch device. Enjoy your personal smartphone or tablet experience on the big surface and share it together with friends, colleagues and family.








TableConnect is the first large scale multi-touch that offers direct connectivity to smartphones and tablets.


It takes advantage of existing software ecosystems like iOS and Android using the connected smartphone or tablet device as a host.


TableConnect therefore unlocks a new dimension that allows for the use of millions of available apps by transferring them to a larger display


It enables you to share your personal app experience with friends, colleagues and family on a oversized multi-touch surface. 



WORK
  Enhance your demonstrations and put your customers right into the center of your brand. Show off the uniqueness of your solutions at a size that leaves an impression and let your audience be part of an interactive presentation experience with TableConnect.


SOCIALIZE
  The first truly social touch screen device ever. People gather around their PCs and phones all the time but the devices are simply not made to be used by several people at once.  With its appealing cutting edge design, the table attracts the attention of those nearby and convinces them to get involved. Multi-touch, in literal terms, has never been as true as what is offered with TableConnect

PLAY
  Select from millions of games or entertainment applications and share the experience with family and friends! TableConnect offers a new and distinctive experience of interactive social gaming & entertainment. Regardless of whether you enjoy a game of Chess or Pinball HD, get together and be ready for some real multi-user interaction like never seen before on a touch device.


1. True multi-user experienceDirect interaction with content is just more intuitive. While multi-touch so far has mostly been associated with two-finger operation, multi-touch on TableConnect really opens up new ways of interaction. Keyboard and mouse are a thing of the past. Through TableConnect's huge size, multitouch operation becomes a multiuser experience. 2. No learning curveWe envisioned TableConnect. A giant multi-touch table that allows you to plug in your smartphone or tablet and use all the apps as if they were on the original device. You don’t need to learn new software, instead you can enjoy the familiar surface of your personal device on a big screen. Simply just Plug & Play3. Save on development costsThere are many multi-touch solutions already in use around the world, you might say. But let´s take a closer look here. Most of these solutions rely on proprietary software (and sometimes hardware) that need custom apps, specifically created for their systems. Due to the naturally low infiltration of such devices, the number of available developers is sparse, resulting in more expensive app development costs for apps.TableConnect on the other hand directly connects to the extensive ecosystem of iOS and Android apps. As a result we believe that custom app development very often will not be necessary at all. And even if you do need a custom app, the development process will definitely be less expensive considering the amount of gifted iOS and Android developers available worldwide.This circumstance will also be key to see innovative solutions specifically designed for TableConnect in the future.4. A real table after allAnd last but not least, let´s talk about the design. While almost any other multitouch “table” out there really is just a tv with bolt-on legs and an ugly bezel, TableConnect in contrast is a piece of luxury furniture. Use it as you would use any other table. Sit on it if you want, get work done or eat lunch with your family and colleagues. Because of it´s seamless design there will also be no dust or breadcrumbs trapped in the corners of the screen.




We are a team of creative brains working hard to make this dream of our´s come true. Naturally there has been some heavy lifting involved with this project and it took a lot of time to find the right partners who genuinely share our vision with the same passion and care for all the little details. At this stage of the project, we need money to produce the 60 inch prototype. This is what the sum of this Indiegogo campaign will be used for. With the full-size-prototype we can perfect all the software, hardware, design and production details, to get TableConnect ready for the market. By funding our project, you are not only helping a bunch of highly dedicated designers and developers realize their vision, but you also have the chance to receive one of many beautiful pledges if you support us!






Inspired by the monolith in Stanley Kubrik’s 2001: A Space Odyssey, TableConnect follows a reduced but sophisticated design language. We wanted to achieve a product that is more than a technical device. We invested countless hours which led to a timeless, reduced body seamlessly covered with ultra-sturdy glass that secretly contains all the functional buttons and a beautiful 60 inch screen.
The anodized black aluminum legs make TableConnect a one-of-a-kind crafted piece of artwork with considerable thought on practicality. Take off one leg to use TableConnect in a vertical position, for example as an interactive display. Put TableConnect on its side to use it in landscape mode, for interactive presentations. Remove all legs to mount TableConnect on every surface. TableConnect’s timeless monolithic design and precise craftsmanship makes it a device built to last.




Here are the key features we are working on for TableConnect:


We have taken some extra effort to make TableConnect’s surface look good in any surrounding. An extra anti-glare layer attached to the panels heavy-duty glass, minimizes reflections so you can enjoy the full TableConnect experience without distractions.



To achieve a seamless and intuitive experience while using TableConnect we made the decision to implement active touch-sensor areas on the surface of the device. With the home button located on all four corners and the orientation buttons at the edges, we made sure that the most frequently used controls are easily accessible.


Use over 1,5 million readily available apps. Create new apps made for TableConnect’s big surface and true multi-user performance. TableConnect simply adds a new dimension to app interaction.


Several backlit sensor buttons provide access to the most used controls of TableConnect, also avoiding complicated menu structures.


To transfer all the necessary data between the host device and TableConnect, we use state of the art technology like HDMI (display signal), Bluetooth (touch signals) and WiFi. TableConnect will offer full iOS & Android connectivity.


One remarkable feature of TableConnect that separates it from all touch devices out there is it’s incredibly beautiful seamless surface. There are no edges that would stop your fingers while swiping and no chance for dirt getting trapped inside the device.

Frequent visitors have an easy life with TableConnect since it’s app provides easy one-touch-pairing making sure you’re ready to touch within seconds.






Since we started this project, we've put a lot of time and money into the development of TableConnect. We developed a fully functional 32 inch proof-of-concept of TableConnect which already assisted in testing new iterations of the software will aid in further development.To bring TableConnect to the next stage we need your support via this Indiegogo campaign to enable us to progress further and construct a full size 60 inch prototype that will include all the features planned for the final product.This prototype will also help us to iron out all the hardware and design features and thereby build a platform that will allow us to fine-tune all the software features (like better response time, quick pairing recognition, Smart Areas implementation, etc.) and finally get TableConnect ready for the market.







When we first envisioned TableConnect, we made a YouTube demonstration video but didn’t tell anyone that it was an elaborate visual effects fake. News outlets from around the world jumped onto it - Forbes, The Sun, Engadget, Gizmodo - to name only a few. The video jumped to 2 million views within three days and became the most viewed YouTube video in the world on one day. It was crazy.
  And so was the demand. We received hundreds of buying requests for a product that didn’t exist …people really like what we did here and that was the perfect motivation to start development and team up with some ingenious brains to bring TableConnect to life.
We developed the proof-of-concept and came up with a very distinct design for the final product. Now we are at a stage where we are looking for funding to build the 60 inch prototype, our last step before we can enter production and start taking orders for TableConnect.


58-inch Table Connect for iPhone multitouch surface easily dwarfs your iPadengadget.com
People said the iPad was just a giant iPhone – so what would they have made of this? Three technology whizzes from Austria have been tinkering on a sleek, 52-inch table with a working iPhone interface, including all the multi-touch capabilities.ForbesTHESE gadget boffins have taken their love of iPhones to a new level – by turning theirs into a TABLE.The Sun
The iPhone’s 3.5-inch display is, at least to Apple, big enough for normal every day usage. And there’s probably hundreds of thousands of folks out there who would agree with that (even if larger screen devices are becomingly increasingly popular), but sometimes you just want to do your photo viewing on something bigger. And not just bigger, but something you can still interact with in the same way you would with your iPhone. Luckily, the 58-inch multitouch table exists, and it’s the real deal.slashgear.comThe Apple iPhone 4 may be a contender for the Greatest Gadget of the 21st Century, but you can't eat your dinner off it. That's where Table Connect comes in, a convergence of furniture and phone that lets you control your apps and games on its surface -- if it's really real, that is.tuaw.com

Despite the fact that we can’t offer you TableConnect at this stage we have some amazing goodies ready for you! For more details have look at the pledges to the right sidebar.

I contributed to a perk but I forgot to add the extra costs for shipping. How can I increase the amount? No problem! If you'd like to add funds for shipping, just make another contribution, select ""No Perk, Just a Contribution.” and type in the shipping fee.
I can't get my payment to work in Paypal, what should I do?
  Email the Indiegogo Customer Happiness Team at support@indiegogo.com. They'll be able to track your transaction and help with any issues.
When will it be available?
  Our plan is to get the full-sized prototype built within the next 6 months. After that, we will gear up for production and at the same time sales start. We expect to ship the first orders within 12 - 18 months from now. 
How much will it cost?This is a tough one to answer because it really depends on the demand and costs of production. We expect the 60 inch TableConnect to cost around € 25.000. TableConnect 32 is expected to cost around €15.000.So even if you are not able to afford one for your private entertainment this does not mean you´ll never be able to use one. If everything works out, you´ll enjoy using TableConnect in shopping malls, restaurants, museums, shops and trade fairs around the world.
Will it work with every iOS device?
  TableConnect will be shipped with a fully pre-configured iOS-Device (iPhone or iPad). The minimum hardware requirement for TableConnect host devices will be an iPhone 4, from the current state of production. All iOS devices need a jailbreak at this stage of development. The availability of jailbreaks for different iOS devices and versions of iOS varies greatly. In general it can be said that as long as a jailbreak is applied, an iOS device will be able to be used with TableConnect. We will provide a detailed list of compatible devices and a manual for configuration.
What if you fail to reach the funding target?
  In addition we worked out alternative plans to find investors and make our vision a reality.
What if you raise more that EUR 40.000?
  With additional money we can speed up the development process and bring TableConnect to the market earlier.
Why can’t you offer TableConnect for sale right away?
  Since we cannot guarantee delivery dates we don’t want to make promises we can’t keep. This is also the main reason we decided to take smaller steps toward our goal and reduce legal risks.

If you have any other questions, don’t hesitate and ask away: indiegogo@tableconnect.net
We aim to reply to all enquiries within 24 hours.

<h1>So if this thing already exists... why are you looking for crowd funding?</h1>
<p>Firstly, allow me to introduce myself. I'm Iain Dooley and I run a little software business in Australia called <a href=""http://www.workingsoftware.com.au/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Working Software</a>.</p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">We started work on </span><a href=""http://www.decalcms.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""line-height: 1.45em;"" target=""_blank"">Decal CMS</a><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> many, many moons ago.</span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">In fact, it began life as a drop in replacement for existing WYSIWYG tools called </span><a href=""http://freecode.com/projects/richierich"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""line-height: 1.45em;"" target=""_blank"">Richie Rich: the poor little rich text editor</a><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> way back in 2006!</span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">I was working as a freelance web developer and my pet hate was WYSIWYG tools and the way they allowed the user to utterly destroy the look and feel of their website.</span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Decal CMS began with a question:</span></p>
<p><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Why can't we just allow people to edit the DOM directly?<br/></b><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Why bother with ""word style"" editing tools at all?</span></b></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The whole paradigm seemed </span><i style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">fundamentally broken</i><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">.</span></p>
<p>Richie Rich was my first attempt at this, and it was <i>completely horrible</i>.</p>
<p>Several iterations and a <a href=""http://www.workingsoftware.com.au/page/The_Team"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">couple of new team members</a> later at the end of 2009, we discovered that something new had arrived in modern browsers: it was called contenteditable.</p>
<p>It was the piece that was always missing from Richie Rich, most notably allowing native keypress handling and cursor positioning in the browser.</p>
<p>We were <i>excited</i>, and we dedicated the <b>next 6 months of our lives</b> to launching Decal to the world.</p>
<p>We got it done and we started using it with our own clients but failed to gain traction with others in the web development community.</p>
<p><b>It was a hard sell.</b></p>
<p>The world had changed and everyone loved Wordpress now.</p>
<p>New browsers had arrived so the fact that our editing tool only worked in Firefox was a show stopper -- everyone loved Webkit.</p>
<p>The deployment process (one of the main selling points) gets cumbersome when your site gets large and the error reporting that tells you if something is misconfigured is cryptic so it's very easy to get completely stuck.</p>
<p>There were bugs in several of the more complex features.</p>
<p>The system was slow....</p>
<p>.... but .... <i>DECAL WORKED</i>.</p>
<p>At a fundamental level we could see that this was something truly incredible.</p>
<p><b>It just wasn't quite there yet.</b></p>
<p>Then we ran out of money. Although we kept building Decal CMS on the side we had to focus on other work to get cash.</p>
<p>At the end of 2011 I was <b>lamenting the tale of Decal</b> to a friend.</p>
<p>I didn't want to keep sinking time and money into Decal unless we really <i>KNEW</i> that we had a market for it -- unless we knew we were solving a problem that people <i>WANTED SOLVED</i>, and that they were <i>WILLING TO PAY FOR</i> (guess who'd read the Lean Startup?) .... </p>
<p>.... but how could we <b>gain traction with web developers</b>?</p>
<p>Decal is a real ""show me"" product. The points of difference are <b>not easily communicated</b>, even through video.</p>
<p>I knew that Decal wasn't ready for prime time.</p>
<p>We couldn't expect people to start using it in real world deployments for real clients. </p>
<p>How could we possibly find out if this is something people would use and pay for if we <b>couldn't even explain what it was</b> and people couldn't find out for themselves?</p>
<p>My friend told me something <i>very important ... </i><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">he said:</span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><i>""You don't need people to be able to use it on real world projects, you just need them to be able to use it enough to understand it"".</i></span></p>
<p><b>This was a turning point.</b></p>
<p>We immediately sprung into action building a ""tour"" for Decal that would demonstrate the value succinctly and effectively enough that people would get why it was great, <b>without having to actually have used it for a real world project.</b></p>
<p>It wasn't easy.</p>
<p>It took us a year.</p>
<p>But we came up with the <a href=""http://www.decalcms.com/tour/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Decal tour</a> and it's worked WONDERS.</p>
<p><b>People love it. Great.</b></p>
<p>Still, w<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">hilst <b>getting email addresses</b> at the end of the tour is fantastic, I'm not going to base a decision to spend another 6 - 8 months and a bunch of cash building this thing unless we get people to make a <i>commitment</i>....</span></p>
<p><b>.... and that's why we're crowd funding.</b></p>
<p>The fact is that, if we wanted to we could finish Decal under our own steam financially, but it's going to be a LOT of work.</p>
<p>Sure it's great to get an extra $20,000 towards the project, but it's not essential: what is essential is knowing that we are solving a <i>REAL PROBLEM</i> that people will <i>PAY FOR</i>.</p>
<p><b>So ... are we?</b></p>
<p>Your pledge will provide the answer.</p>
<h1>What you will get for your money, and when</h1>
<p>We only have one ""perk"", and only one funding level: $200.</p>
<p>It's set deliberately high enough to dissuade the window shoppers.</p>
<p>We only want people who build websites for a living, for whom we're solving a genuine problem to fund this campaign. Not friends and well-wishers.</p>
<p>If that's you, then $200 is not prohibitively high.</p>
<p>Your initial $200 investment will buy you 1 year's access to Decal for up to 10 websites. </p>
<p>If one of these sites is storing an unusually large amount of data (images/video) or has an unusually large amount of traffic and it's costing us a tonne of money we reserve the right to request you pay a monthly charge over and above your initial investment, but we'll be reasonable about it.</p>
<p>We just need to make sure we don't spend all our money on hosting costs and drive outselves out of business.</p>
<p>Long term, we haven't really figured out pricing yet, but it won't be dissimilar to something like LightCMS or WPEngine.</p>
<p>We plan on using our initial customers to verify what our typical hosting costs are and then determine what we need to charge in order to stay profitable.</p>
<p>Getting this project fully funded will allow us to dedicate much more time to building Decal than we would if we were self-funding, and we estimate we'll have v1 launched by about June 2014.</p>
<p></p>
<h1>What will Decal CMS v1 include?</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Decal CMS is a hosted product. We will launch with hosting in the USA, Western Europe and Australia.</p>
<p>The version we launch with will feature the ability to deploy a full CMS (including the ability to add multiple pages, edit menus etc.) by adding attributes to your HTML. This is demonstrated in the <a href=""http://www.decalcms.com/tour/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Decal Tour</a>.</p>
<p>The deployment will be via Dropbox or git commit hooks (with github and bitbucket integration).</p>
<p>Content migration will allow you to modify the structure of your site and have the data automatically mapped from the old structure, into the new site seamlessly.</p>
<p>The editor will work in the latest Firefox, Safari and Chrome with IE10 potentially being supported (although we can't guarantee that).</p>
<p>We will offer a set of basic ""filters"" (our version of plugins) for free such as menu editors, SEO and social media tools.</p>
<p>The system will be fully documented with thorough error reporting, slick tutorial and on-boarding process and training tools for clients.</p>
<p>The ""filters"" system will be fully documented for people to being development their own filters.</p>
<p>The API will be documented and published, delivering content in either XML or JSON formats.</p>
<h1>Risks and challenges</h1>
<p>As mentioned above we already have Decal built.</p>
<p>We also already have a version of the editor which works in all modern browsers (no IE yet, sorry) which is what we use for the <a href=""http://www.decalcms.com/tour/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Decal Tour</a>.</p>
<p>Basically what we're going to do is combine this updated frontend with the backend, rip out a bunch of unnecessarily complex features, improve the deployment process and dramatically speed up performance.</p>
<p>We already know precisely how we'll do all these things so whilst it's hard to guarantee precisely how long it will take (probably between 6 and 8 months) we can guarantee we won't run out of money doing it and that we have the skills and expertise to make it the project happen.</p>
<h1>You've mentioned an ""Extended Tour"" ... can I check it out?</h1>
<p>You sure can! The Decal Extended Tour is setup to give you a really comprehensive understanding of how everything works. The final version will be slightly different but the fundamental features will be as demonstrated in the extended tour.</p>
<p>If you'd like to try it out email team@workingsoftware.com.au with ""Extended tour request"" in the subject line.</p>
<h1>More questions?</h1>
<p>Email team@workingsoftware.com.au. We'd love to hear from you and we're here to help.</p>

There is not a single CMS today which adequately handles the task of editing structured data.... which is the only thing a CMS is supposed to do!
Why is that such a problem?One word: mobileWhen you deploy a website these days you need it to look beautiful on any device.You need to make sure that the structure of the document is maintained ... ... that ""formatting instructions"" (like font styles and element positioning) are kept out of the content and in the stylesheets where they belong.To deal with the problem of editing structured data (which is basically what HTML is), today's content management systems do one of two things:

Limit the type of content someone can edit (ie. they can only update blog posts or ""body text"" -- this seriously restricts the design process)


Use HTML forms to provide structured input so that content can be saved in a highly structured database (this is either very unusable, very expensive or both)

At the other end of the spectrum we have DIY editing tools which allow people to do things like change font sizes, colours and position of elements on the screen via a ""drag 'n' drop"" interface.They might get it looking okay on their own screen, but it will break when they try to view it on a mobile phone.How can we cost effectively allow highly structured websites to be edited, hassle free, by non-technical people ... without giving them enough rope to hang themselves?This is where Decal CMS comes in. Decal provides a simple way for frontend web developers to make their HTML editable, without any backend coding or database work.
By adding a few simple attributes to your static HTML documents, you can take a chunk of a page and, for example, allow the user to edit the heading, image and body text, right on the page and optionally repeat this ""component"" one or more times down the page.

For the content editor, this means they can always see EXACTLY what their page will look like as they type. No more ""previews""!

As the developer, you have complete control over how much or how little they can deviate from the structure you've provided.

The content manager makes no design decisions.


They can't change font styles, sizes or colours


They can't change spacing


They can't hit enter a bunch of times to add space below a heading


They can't drag things around


They can't paste in random HTML (unless you specifically allow it)



As the developer, you can provide ""custom classes"" which give the content editor the ability to select from pre-defined styles you have included in your CSS.

You can see how that works in this short video from our ""Decal Extended Tour"":





The result?



A CMS that's intuitive and easy to use with no instruction manual or external style guide


A website that looks just as beautiful on any device as it did the day you handed it over (no matter how many people are editing it)


Faster, cheaper deployments with no hosting hassles or coding/database work



What about plugins?
Decal is a hosted CMS.
We take care of all the hosting woes, security issues and scalability/performance problems that usually plague your typical self-hosted CMS (*cough* wordpress *cough*).
In order to provide a rich plugin architecture we have developed a concept called ""filters"".
You can write your plugins in ANY language and host them ANYWHERE.
You heard that right ... don't believe me? Take a look at this video (from our ""Decal Extended Tour""):


So if this thing already exists... why are you looking for crowd funding?
Firstly, allow me to introduce myself. I'm Iain Dooley and I run a little software business in Australia called Working Software.
We started work on Decal CMS many, many moons ago.
In fact, it began life as a drop in replacement for existing WYSIWYG tools called Richie Rich: the poor little rich text editor way back in 2006!
I was working as a freelance web developer and my pet hate was WYSIWYG tools and the way they allowed the user to utterly destroy the look and feel of their website.
Decal CMS began with a question:
Why can't we just allow people to edit the DOM directly?Why bother with ""word style"" editing tools at all?
The whole paradigm seemed fundamentally broken.
Richie Rich was my first attempt at this, and it was completely horrible.
Several iterations and a couple of new team members later at the end of 2009, we discovered that something new had arrived in modern browsers: it was called contenteditable.
It was the piece that was always missing from Richie Rich, most notably allowing native keypress handling and cursor positioning in the browser.
We were excited, and we dedicated the next 6 months of our lives to launching Decal to the world.
We got it done and we started using it with our own clients but failed to gain traction with others in the web development community.
It was a hard sell.
The world had changed and everyone loved Wordpress now.
New browsers had arrived so the fact that our editing tool only worked in Firefox was a show stopper -- everyone loved Webkit.
The deployment process (one of the main selling points) gets cumbersome when your site gets large and the error reporting that tells you if something is misconfigured is cryptic so it's very easy to get completely stuck.
There were bugs in several of the more complex features.
The system was slow....
.... but .... DECAL WORKED.
At a fundamental level we could see that this was something truly incredible.
It just wasn't quite there yet.
Then we ran out of money. Although we kept building Decal CMS on the side we had to focus on other work to get cash.
At the end of 2011 I was lamenting the tale of Decal to a friend.
I didn't want to keep sinking time and money into Decal unless we really KNEW that we had a market for it -- unless we knew we were solving a problem that people WANTED SOLVED, and that they were WILLING TO PAY FOR (guess who'd read the Lean Startup?) .... 
.... but how could we gain traction with web developers?
Decal is a real ""show me"" product. The points of difference are not easily communicated, even through video.
I knew that Decal wasn't ready for prime time.
We couldn't expect people to start using it in real world deployments for real clients. 
How could we possibly find out if this is something people would use and pay for if we couldn't even explain what it was and people couldn't find out for themselves?
My friend told me something very important ... he said:
""You don't need people to be able to use it on real world projects, you just need them to be able to use it enough to understand it"".
This was a turning point.
We immediately sprung into action building a ""tour"" for Decal that would demonstrate the value succinctly and effectively enough that people would get why it was great, without having to actually have used it for a real world project.
It wasn't easy.
It took us a year.
But we came up with the Decal tour and it's worked WONDERS.
People love it. Great.
Still, whilst getting email addresses at the end of the tour is fantastic, I'm not going to base a decision to spend another 6 - 8 months and a bunch of cash building this thing unless we get people to make a commitment....
.... and that's why we're crowd funding.
The fact is that, if we wanted to we could finish Decal under our own steam financially, but it's going to be a LOT of work.
Sure it's great to get an extra $20,000 towards the project, but it's not essential: what is essential is knowing that we are solving a REAL PROBLEM that people will PAY FOR.
So ... are we?
Your pledge will provide the answer.
What you will get for your money, and when
We only have one ""perk"", and only one funding level: $200.
It's set deliberately high enough to dissuade the window shoppers.
We only want people who build websites for a living, for whom we're solving a genuine problem to fund this campaign. Not friends and well-wishers.
If that's you, then $200 is not prohibitively high.
Your initial $200 investment will buy you 1 year's access to Decal for up to 10 websites. 
If one of these sites is storing an unusually large amount of data (images/video) or has an unusually large amount of traffic and it's costing us a tonne of money we reserve the right to request you pay a monthly charge over and above your initial investment, but we'll be reasonable about it.
We just need to make sure we don't spend all our money on hosting costs and drive outselves out of business.
Long term, we haven't really figured out pricing yet, but it won't be dissimilar to something like LightCMS or WPEngine.
We plan on using our initial customers to verify what our typical hosting costs are and then determine what we need to charge in order to stay profitable.
Getting this project fully funded will allow us to dedicate much more time to building Decal than we would if we were self-funding, and we estimate we'll have v1 launched by about June 2014.

What will Decal CMS v1 include?

Decal CMS is a hosted product. We will launch with hosting in the USA, Western Europe and Australia.
The version we launch with will feature the ability to deploy a full CMS (including the ability to add multiple pages, edit menus etc.) by adding attributes to your HTML. This is demonstrated in the Decal Tour.
The deployment will be via Dropbox or git commit hooks (with github and bitbucket integration).
Content migration will allow you to modify the structure of your site and have the data automatically mapped from the old structure, into the new site seamlessly.
The editor will work in the latest Firefox, Safari and Chrome with IE10 potentially being supported (although we can't guarantee that).
We will offer a set of basic ""filters"" (our version of plugins) for free such as menu editors, SEO and social media tools.
The system will be fully documented with thorough error reporting, slick tutorial and on-boarding process and training tools for clients.
The ""filters"" system will be fully documented for people to being development their own filters.
The API will be documented and published, delivering content in either XML or JSON formats.
Risks and challenges
As mentioned above we already have Decal built.
We also already have a version of the editor which works in all modern browsers (no IE yet, sorry) which is what we use for the Decal Tour.
Basically what we're going to do is combine this updated frontend with the backend, rip out a bunch of unnecessarily complex features, improve the deployment process and dramatically speed up performance.
We already know precisely how we'll do all these things so whilst it's hard to guarantee precisely how long it will take (probably between 6 and 8 months) we can guarantee we won't run out of money doing it and that we have the skills and expertise to make it the project happen.
You've mentioned an ""Extended Tour"" ... can I check it out?
You sure can! The Decal Extended Tour is setup to give you a really comprehensive understanding of how everything works. The final version will be slightly different but the fundamental features will be as demonstrated in the extended tour.

<p></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">While we're here we should talk about DSD for a moment.  Most of the digital audio world  (including Digital Signal Processing) currently runs on PCM or Pulse Code Modulation.  </span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">In the PCM world, faster speeds and more bits are both better, and 192 kHz (speed) with 24 bits (depth) is as good as most downloads get.  DSD (or Direct Stream Digital) is a format which some argue is more ""listenable"" than PCM, and is also the archive format of choice for many producers.  </span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">The problem with it is that any manipulation of it, even volume control, requires that the data be turned into analog first.  Still, buying music in the DSD format might be a good idea if the tracks sold are in the same format as they are archived in. </span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Bottom line is JRiver Media Center will  decode your DSD files and hand them over to Thunder UnderBass at 192 kHz/ 24 bit PCM for playback.</span></p>

<h3>Why We Chose Indiegogo.</h3>
<p>We don't just make speakers, we craft products that have a voice.  We design holistic works of art that enrich and excite.  We chose Indiegogo because this is
an atmosphere that resonates with that voice and our passion for living and creating.</p>
<p>This project is much more about who we are and how we want to get to know you, our loyal customers.  This is a premier environment to engage each other without any middlemen to mess it up for everybody.  It's between us, and that's just the way we like it.</p>
<p>We've been spoiled with awesome audio on our desktops for a long time with our professional studio monitors.  We needed the stars to align to create a desktop audio solution that was affordable AND sounded great.  We also needed a platform to launch Thunder UnderBass.  Indiegogo is crowd funding at its best, what more can we say?</p>
<p>Let's not forget this isn't just about entertainment, it's about entertaining.  When you hear <i>THAT</i> song you want to <i><b>FEEL</b></i> it, especially when you're sharing it with a friend for the first time.  The average desktop speaker or TV soundbar alone just doesn't cut it. Now if you already own a $1000 + pair of monitors or if you spent car money on a soundbar this might not be for you.  Then again, awesome bass ON the desktop and right UNDER your TV is really sweet... just saying.</p>

</div></div>","Thunder UnderBass is an Ultra- HiFi Digital Audio Media Center and subwoofer with USB 2 connectivity and loaded with killer Digital Signal Processing - DSP.  Thunder UnderBass turns any pair of active speakers you already own (that includes the soundbar you bought for your TV) into 192kHz/ 24bit digital dynamos.  

Thunder UnderBass fits nicely ON your desktop, UNDER your TV, on a bookshelf, and slides nicely into a component rack.  Now you can watch TV, movies, play video games, and listen to music the way it's meant to be heard!  Want to stream music from your smartphone?  Do it!  Bluetooth is built in.
Any of the following devices connect to Thunder UnderBass either as a source component or output device via the appropriate cable or via Bluetooth.  With the exception of traditional passive speakers, Thunder UnderBass is universally compatible with virtually any audio equipment.









Finally!  Put deep accurate bass ON your desktop or UNDER your TV... where it is unquestionably most effective.  We designed the subwoofer to move you and not your neighbors or your desk. Now you can take your powered desktop or computer speakers and TV soundbar from zero to hero instantly (active speakers only).Digital Signal Processing


As
is true of most great innovations we asked ourselves, “What if?”  What if we took the best digital elements of our professional-grade studio monitors, build it for the consumer market and designed it to work with anyone’s
existing equipment? The answer to that question was Thunder UnderBass.  More about this later, but our DSP reaches into your analog speakers and ""makes them digital.""  We make drivers perform the way they are supposed to. 
Digital to Analog & Analog to Digital







You'll appreciate the ultra-low jitter high-resolution digital audio you'll be listening to up to 192 kHz/ 24 bit.  We use advanced Analog Devices DSP and Cirrus Logic & Burr Brown CODECs for all the A-D and D-A, because they kick ass and we know you want to rock.

Some people ask us why all the DSP though?  Because the best DACs on Earth cost thousands of dollars and even a perfect digital signal converted to perfection sounds ordinary on an ordinary set of speakers.  We write our own killer DSP to make even average speakers sound amazing. So now you don't have to run out and buy a $3K pair of monitors to appreciate high resolution audio.


USB from Your Computer & Optical from Your TV









We use the super-fast XMOS USB 2.0/ Audio Class 2.0 solution to get sound to and from the computer.  Use Thunder UnderBass' optical input/output to connect your TV and soundbar. No need to worry about any special cables to buy we're including the USB and optical cables with your Thunder UnderBass.



Dolby Digital Decoding & The Works!


Really into gaming?  Looking for the latest in Dolby Digital decoding?  Need an ultra-versatile system for the entire family?  You need The Works! This is our top of the line, no holds barred everything included super-system.  For movies, games, and sports The Works delivers a sound experience rarely heard on anything less than a $3K home-theater system.To do this right though we had to design custom matching front Right, Left and Center channel speakers to play nice with Dolby.  These cutie-pies are tuned and precision matched to Thunder UnderBass and produce an expressive sound stage that will surprise you.

The Awesome JRiver Media Center




You also get the super-deluxe JRiver Media Center.  It will already be provisioned with the best settings for plug and play awesomeness. And JRiver Media Center automatically finds and syncs all the music on your computer, iTunes, or NAS.


Audio File Types We Support & Play
There are a lot of audio file types out there and while most of these formats you will probably never play, it's always better to have it and not need it than to need it and not have it.


While we're here we should talk about DSD for a moment.  Most of the digital audio world  (including Digital Signal Processing) currently runs on PCM or Pulse Code Modulation.  
In the PCM world, faster speeds and more bits are both better, and 192 kHz (speed) with 24 bits (depth) is as good as most downloads get.  DSD (or Direct Stream Digital) is a format which some argue is more ""listenable"" than PCM, and is also the archive format of choice for many producers.  
The problem with it is that any manipulation of it, even volume control, requires that the data be turned into analog first.  Still, buying music in the DSD format might be a good idea if the tracks sold are in the same format as they are archived in. 
Bottom line is JRiver Media Center will  decode your DSD files and hand them over to Thunder UnderBass at 192 kHz/ 24 bit PCM for playback.

Bluetooth Built In










Of course Thunder UnderBass has Bluetooth built in so you're ready to go any time from any Bluetooth capable device; computer, smartphone, or tablet for example. Even though Bluetooth isn't high-resolution (yet) the convenience is definitely a bonus!



Killer Headphone Amps 

If you like headphones, great!  We do too, so we included EIGHT stellar HiFi headphone amplifiers with two headphone jacks.  So if you're a gamer like some of us here, you and your friends will hear in high resolution through the cans too.


Geek Out With iOS & Android Smart Apps



If you like to get techie, good news, we've been thinking about you.

sets.  Above is a screenshot that is similar to what the analyzer will

All perks are accessible in the right sidebar above. 
We REALLY want to make Thunder UnderBass absolutely incredible.  In harmony with our wishes we REALLY want to deliver it to ALL of you with a deluxe PHANTOM GRAPHICS package.For this to be possible at the price point we are offering here we need to sell a lot of Thunder UnderBass units; 5,000 minimum.  And if you were able to help us get us beyond 15,000 units we will also be able to include a killer LCD touchscreen on ALL units delivered AND wireless Left, Right, and Center channel speakers for all The Works systems that deliver.
As things shape up here we will share more details about how you can help us make this happen faster.  Regardless, Thank you so much for supporting our dream.  We only want to give you the best!





We make professional studio monitors and control systems for the desktop.  Our products give the power back to the recording artist, where it belongs.  We are based in Apopka, Florida and our company is run by its two founders that lead our team of engineers, musicians, artists and designers.


Thank you for coming. It's so nice to meet you!








Why We Chose Indiegogo.
We don't just make speakers, we craft products that have a voice.  We design holistic works of art that enrich and excite.  We chose Indiegogo because this is
an atmosphere that resonates with that voice and our passion for living and creating.
This project is much more about who we are and how we want to get to know you, our loyal customers.  This is a premier environment to engage each other without any middlemen to mess it up for everybody.  It's between us, and that's just the way we like it.
We've been spoiled with awesome audio on our desktops for a long time with our professional studio monitors.  We needed the stars to align to create a desktop audio solution that was affordable AND sounded great.  We also needed a platform to launch Thunder UnderBass.  Indiegogo is crowd funding at its best, what more can we say?
Let's not forget this isn't just about entertainment, it's about entertaining.  When you hear THAT song you want to FEEL it, especially when you're sharing it with a friend for the first time.  The average desktop speaker or TV soundbar alone just doesn't cut it. Now if you already own a $1000 + pair of monitors or if you spent car money on a soundbar this might not be for you.  Then again, awesome bass ON the desktop and right UNDER your TV is really sweet... just saying.











We have fully functional hand-made prototypes already built, but they are just that; prototypes. We aren't a billion dollar company and we can only afford to do modest runs at best with our manufacturing and logistics partners.  
With your help we can finalize the hardware and software aspects of Thunder UnderBass and finance legitimate pre-production and pilot runs required to bring any new product to market successfully.
In a nutshell you're making it possible for us to bring Thunder UnderBass to you, our customer's.  Your contributions are also having a dramatic positive impact on the big picture.  This affords us the ability to focus on the countless details and possible challenges in the months ahead.


When does Thunder UnderBass deliver?We are shipping Thunder UnderBass in April with deliveries expected the first week of May, 2015.  We need time to process all the orders, finalize some of the hardware and software elements, refine packaging and shipping and fine-tune the fulfillment logistics with our partners and ramp up final production.

Sharing an interest in technology and design, we agreed a better job could be done designing technology in such a way that it blends in with your environment and has a warmer and more human feel to it. Present day technology often leans toward a science-fiction type design aesthetic, which we can certainly appreciate, but it isn’t necessarily something we’d welcome into our homes. It tends to feel rather cold. So we set out to develop a brand that takes contemporary technology and puts it in a more attractive package, something you’d love to have in your home.</p><p>Following the adoption of wireless charging by Apple (a company revered for design) in its new range of iPhones, we figured a wireless charger is a great first product to kickstart the Bentokai brand. Wireless charging makes life easier and is something you would put in your home. It’s likely we’re going to see it everywhere in the near future (think, Free Wifi).</p><p>After we nailed down the mission and the product we started our design exploration. Inspired by natural material we eventually selected bamboo because of its looks and physical qualities. To our delight it’s also a very sustainable material because it grows incredibly fast and absorbs more CO2 than it produces. And thus our second value was born: We want our products to be as eco-friendly as possible, employing renewable, sustainable material that’s easy to recycle.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1519488945/cnlqucn81d6tggi2oyqt.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><strong>Quick introduction of the Bentokai team</strong></p><p>Industrial designer <strong>Vlad</strong> has extensive experience working with bamboo employing it in diverse products ranging from speakers to foldable laptop stands.

Ready to go? No, wait! Where is my pen? Where did I leave my post-it notes? Argh! Bentokai presents a complete wireless charging desktop organizer solution: Add our stackable organizer to your desk to keep things in place and your phone charged. When you’re done, simply stack them up to store your essentials tightly together with magnets.More photos of the  Stack in the update section Bentokai Wireless ChargerAre you ready to take advantage of new wireless charging technology? No more chaining your phone to a cable for charging, no more proprietary broken cables that are expensive to replace. Bentokai takes the new wireless charging experience and puts it into a warmer, more human enclosure that better fits your living space. We make a wireless charger that doesn’t look out of place, makes your life easier and is made from sustainable material.The Bentokai wireless charger is larger than the average charge pad available on the market today, allowing two phones to charge comfortably at the same time. It’s made from strong, durable, light-weight bamboo that features a natural wooden grain. It’s nice to know that bamboo is a highly renewable resource that’s easy to recycle. How is it used?It’s simple:
Plug your Bentokai wireless charger into a wall outlet or USB port
Place your phone* on top of the Bentokai wireless charger
Done! It’s charging now.
*Your phone should support wireless charging, like the iPhone 8, iPhone X or Galaxy S8 or have an adaptor cover (see FAQ). Discover how it can work for youObserve your everyday places and notice where you regularly put down your phone. For instance: on your desk, in the office, next to your bed, in the kitchen, near the couch. Any of these will be a perfect place to put a Bentokai wireless charger. Consider how you use your phone in these spots:1.    As a wake-up alarm, to get the day started. Put a Bentokai wireless charger on your nightstand and your phone charges while you sleep.2.    Perusing your Instagram feed during breakfast. Add a Bentokai wireless charger to your breakfast table and charge while you explore.3.    As second screen to keep important information handy while you’re crunching the numbers. Have a Bentokai wireless charger on your desk to keep your phone going throughout the working day.4.    Or to stream your favorite music to set the right creative mood. Include a Bentokai wireless charger in your creative workspace to keep the music playing.5.    Learning from a recipe video to cook a new dish, or watching your favorite show just because. Put a Bentokai wireless charger in your kitchen (don’t mistake it for your bamboo cutting board!)6.    As entertainment center, remote controlling video and music. Your couch area is a good place to charge while you use these heavy battery-drain apps.All you need is a Bentokai wireless charger in these spots to keep your phone charged effortlessly. Features
Powerful and fast wireless charging, adopting the Qi industry standard
Large charging area & sweet spot: No fiddly positioning of your phone
Charge two phones at the same time
Replaceable USB cable* to customize the look and match your interior
Made from sustainable bamboo
*USB cable not included, can be added to your order after the campaign ends. Technical specs*Technical specs based on current working prototype, subject to change Why crowdfunding?We want to develop Bentokai into a lifestyle brand that accelerates the transition of the tech world to a more human-centered industry that incorporates more renewable materials, one product at a time.We need your support to fund our bamboo wireless charger production run, and demonstrate we can do it at scale. When successfully funded, we will extend our range to include more bamboo products (matching desktop accessories!) and further expand our exploration into other sustainable materials such as eco-leather. We invite you to become part of our community driving our vision forward! Behind the scenesBentokai started at CIC Rotterdam where Nick, Vlad, Muhil and Martijn met at Venture Cafe. Sharing an interest in technology and design, we agreed a better job could be done designing technology in such a way that it blends in with your environment and has a warmer and more human feel to it. Present day technology often leans toward a science-fiction type design aesthetic, which we can certainly appreciate, but it isn’t necessarily something we’d welcome into our homes. It tends to feel rather cold. So we set out to develop a brand that takes contemporary technology and puts it in a more attractive package, something you’d love to have in your home.Following the adoption of wireless charging by Apple (a company revered for design) in its new range of iPhones, we figured a wireless charger is a great first product to kickstart the Bentokai brand. Wireless charging makes life easier and is something you would put in your home. It’s likely we’re going to see it everywhere in the near future (think, Free Wifi).After we nailed down the mission and the product we started our design exploration. Inspired by natural material we eventually selected bamboo because of its looks and physical qualities. To our delight it’s also a very sustainable material because it grows incredibly fast and absorbs more CO2 than it produces. And thus our second value was born: We want our products to be as eco-friendly as possible, employing renewable, sustainable material that’s easy to recycle.Quick introduction of the Bentokai teamIndustrial designer Vlad has extensive experience working with bamboo employing it in diverse products ranging from speakers to foldable laptop stands. He runs his own makerspace in Rotterdam where he pushes the laser cutter to the max, teaching his students the secrets of good design.Product developer and head of technology Nick has over 20 years of experience developing tech products and bringing them successfully into manufacturing. A true globetrotter dividing his time between continents.Sustainable process engineer and entrepreneur Muhil is on a mission to improve the planet by developing sustainable products that replace the more ones.Product manager and head of user experience, Martijn loves to bring purposeful products to market by embedding them in contemporary culture. Where are we now?We’ve completed all design, engineering, prototyping and testing and are now working with our factory to get everything ready for production. All of us have experience with crowdfunding and we know the crunch is in the end. We set a reasonable delivery timeframe, but there’s always things that can go wrong. For instance technical problems with the laser cutter in the factory or delays with the electronics.We will give regular updates here on Indiegogo and make sure we let our backers know when things change in the process. FAQMy phone doesn’t support wireless charging, can I still use Bentokai?Yes, but you’ll need an adaptor. You can enable wireless charging on your phone by putting it into a cover (sold separately) that turns your phone into a wireless charging unit.Can it charge my Android phone?Yes, any device that supports standard Qi charging will work.Will it charge my Apple watch?No, the Apple watch uses a proprietary type of wireless charging.Does it charge any device that supports wireless charging?As long as your device uses the Qi wireless charging standard you can charge it with Bentokai.Does it charge with my phone cover on?Yes, it charges through most commercially available covers. No need to take your cover off.Does it come with a micro USB cable?No, we plan to make a micro USB cable available for purchase in the fulfillment phase of the campaign. Instructions will be provided after the campaign has ended.Does it come with a wall adaptor?No, we plan to make a wall adaptor suitable for your country available for purchase in the fulfillment phase of the campaign. Instructions will be provided after the campaign has ended.Can I connect it to an USB slot of my laptop to charge?YesWhen will you ship?We’re currently in prototype phase and plan to ship the final product to our first backers in June 2018.Do you ship worldwide?Yes, our shipping provider ships worldwide.

<p>Anima.ey is based upon
psychological analysis methods that were first pioneered in the 1950s and
1960s. During this time, a researcher named Rhoda Kellogg conducted a study of

emotional distress that appear in drawings that were created via a touch
screen.Upon completion of the software
development process, we plan to test the software on a limited number of
selected children (check out the perks if you'd like to participate!) and soon
thereafter, we will release the project to the public.
Our desire is to finalize the
fundraising, research and development phases of this project as soon as
possible so we can release Anima.ey to the marketplace at some point in 2014.

We're now in the digital era and are ready to give a second life to it with the only low-cost digital back available on the market!Four years have passed since the first prototype of I'm Back®35 was realized through a simple 3D printer. Many believed in this project and supported us since the beginning. And thanks to all our backers I'm Back®35 became true. It's also thanks to the massive feedback from our supporter and together with hard work that I'm Back®35 is evolving and improved significantly since the first version.We now are proud to present to you the new ""I'm Back®35"" edition, which brings with it great changes and not only a completely new design, inspired by the old ""motor drivers"" but a revised and modern shape. The main innovation nevertheless, is the software, that gives now the possibility to take photos with the MANUAL mode, leaving the user full control of the shutter speed and the diaphragm aperture of the camera. I'm Back®35 will then record the images as it was set through the analog camera! 
 ""The only digital back that pairs with analog cameras. In manual or automatic mode, it gives a shot to their desire for fantasy! Set photos or videos, I'm Back®35 records everything as you decide. You can also afford erroneous exposure ... or not! With his new ""universal cover "" I'm Back®35 pairs with almost all the most famous analog cameras. New technology. New and more ergonomic design. New battery with high performance. I'm Back®35. Because the pleasure of photography has no age.""

i) Praktica b200/MTL, 
j) Ricoh KR10, 
k) Yashica JP/FX3.
 The above camera models fit also to the Universal Cover. If your camera is not in the above list, it should be compatible with the Universal Cover that is already included in the I'm Back®35 box, if:
1- the back of your analog camera is detachable without damaging it;
2- your camera has a standard tripod screw hole on the bottom.Example of Universal Cover compatible models;Leica M5, Canon FTb ,  T70, Nikon F-501, Minolta i-9000, Praktica B-100, Praktica MTL-3, Contax, Leica RE, Yashica FR.

Those without a hole for the tripod, (Contax II for example - For this camera model we drawing a dedicated cover), for others not.
Electronic cables that prevent the removal of the back cover, (Canon Eos 5 for example),
 Have the film loader not like most, on the top of the camera but at the bottom 
Has a large battery grip on the bottom that cannot be removed (Nikon F5, F6 for example)
If your camera (or cameras) has one of the listed features, it is not compatible with the universal I'm back adapter, but you need a dedicated cover, such as the Contax II which when you remove the cover, removes the hole tripod together. On the other hand, if your camera is a normal srl or a viewfinder, then it is compatible, regardless of what brand it is.  

Easy to install. Remove the cover. Fit the dedicated or universal cover. Fix the screw to the tripod hole. Fit to I'm Back®35.

   You have full control of your camera. You can shoot now with your old analog as you always did and record the photos and videos digitally! With our new I'm Back®35 you decide the speed and aperture and you can use your machine's photometer to decide the exposition you want to have. Now it's up to you, you can even ""make mistakes""as it used to happen in the past while using the manual mode.You also can choose the ""automatic mode"" simply by switching your camera to B mode and selecting the diaphragm aperture, this remains possible as in the previous model. Finally you must focus the objective and click, waiting the three beeps to shoot the photo.Remember that you can always print all photos, we suggest you to try the normal A4 format, the quality is impressive good.Finally, I'm Back®35 uses a focusing screen, the images therefore are vintage, smooth and are not comparable to a standard digital photocamera, so the result will ""resemble"" something between analog and digital, or UNIQUE!

<h3>Phytography Book</h3>
<p>Karel Doing is an artist, filmmaker and researcher. He started working with Super 8 film and black&amp;white photography in 1986 and has developed a broad practice including experimental films, documentaries and photography. In 2016 he developed a new technique tapping into the chemistry of plants to make images directly on photographic emulsion. This technique is dubbed 'Phytography' and has traveled around the world in the capable hands of many experimental filmmakers and photographers. This campaign is aimed at the publication of an artist book, bringing together images and texts by a number of artists who have extensively used Phytography. The book will be handmade and printed in a limited edition of 100 copies.</p>

<h3>The generosity of plants</h3>
<p>Phytography is not just a technique but it is also a communication channel between people and plants. Plants provide us with oxygen, nutrition, medicines and dyes. Plants also contribute to our general well being in a way that cannot be quantified in numbers or money. Phytography offers an embodied and collaborative form of engagement with plants and people. Rebuilding our relationship with the natural world is essential in this time of ecological crisis. Resisting the prevailing narrative of hyper individualism is equally important. Phytography can make a small but inspiring contribution to these aims.</p>

We believed that the advanced modular studio can change the way we take photos at home.</p><p>With this in mind, our team spent countless nights designing, prototyping, testing, programming, and pitching our ideas to thousands of people, receiving feedback on <strong>Photon LMS</strong>. Six months in, our product has been verified and is ready for manufacturing. </p><p> </p><h3> <strong>WE MUST BEGIN:</strong>
</h3><p> </p><p>""At first there was an <strong>IDEA</strong>! The birth of it was quite simple: for the umpteenth time when I faced problems of object shooting, I figured out that all currently available equipment is inconvenient, non-practical and not technological (flashes, softboxes, fixations,etc.), how bulky it is, and the main issue - how <strong>EXPENSIVE</strong> <strong>is all of that is combined</strong>!</p><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/KDlHypc4RiY?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div><p>Then I've decided to purchase standard photo boxes for detailed object shooting, however, I also found disadvantages in them: mostly made for isolated objects on the background, it was still difficult to cope with the light. That's how I got the concept of a controlled light system.</p><p>Afterward, I made <strong>3D</strong> modeling design of the photo studio, pinned my idea in away.</p><p>Since that moment I can proudly state that it was the beginning of our <strong>StartUp</strong>! </p><p>I have started testing: proofing my theory, I bought <strong>LED</strong> lamps and black cardboard â€” created the first prototype by myself. Using this first sample of <strong>Photon LMS</strong> I've undergone the detailed object shooting for our partners. Everything worked out just right!</p><p>Thus we decided to continue working on the first prototype. In a short while, it was ready, made of plywood &amp; metal. The software was managed exclusively on one old tablet, nevertheless, it worked!</p><p>In August <strong>2018</strong> we went public with that achievement and won Concepter <strong>Acceleration</strong> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1571735168/fpewy740rrhdbmpb0bkm.jpg"" src=""""/>program as well as <strong>CES2019</strong> booth supported by <strong>UVCA</strong>. It was a huge success! </p><p>Though the real complex part was only impending, we were to create a fully operating prototype and all we had was <strong>2</strong> <strong>months</strong> to figure all of that out. We got to work with all our strength. There were numerous tests with <strong>LED</strong>, frame details, mounting systems, electronics schemes, and software.

 The MONSTER POWER lighting to draw any light scene you may need to cover objects. Energy-efficient LEDs are built-in in every module.    We have come a long way since we first came up with the idea of creating a fully controlled light system one year ago. We believed that the advanced modular studio can change the way we take photos at home.With this in mind, our team spent countless nights designing, prototyping, testing, programming, and pitching our ideas to thousands of people, receiving feedback on Photon LMS. Six months in, our product has been verified and is ready for manufacturing.   WE MUST BEGIN:
 ""At first there was an IDEA! The birth of it was quite simple: for the umpteenth time when I faced problems of object shooting, I figured out that all currently available equipment is inconvenient, non-practical and not technological (flashes, softboxes, fixations,etc.), how bulky it is, and the main issue - how EXPENSIVE is all of that is combined!Then I've decided to purchase standard photo boxes for detailed object shooting, however, I also found disadvantages in them: mostly made for isolated objects on the background, it was still difficult to cope with the light. That's how I got the concept of a controlled light system.Afterward, I made 3D modeling design of the photo studio, pinned my idea in away.Since that moment I can proudly state that it was the beginning of our StartUp! I have started testing: proofing my theory, I bought LED lamps and black cardboard â€” created the first prototype by myself. Using this first sample of Photon LMS I've undergone the detailed object shooting for our partners. Everything worked out just right!Thus we decided to continue working on the first prototype. In a short while, it was ready, made of plywood & metal. The software was managed exclusively on one old tablet, nevertheless, it worked!In August 2018 we went public with that achievement and won Concepter Acceleration program as well as CES2019 booth supported by UVCA. It was a huge success! Though the real complex part was only impending, we were to create a fully operating prototype and all we had was 2 months to figure all of that out. We got to work with all our strength. There were numerous tests with LED, frame details, mounting systems, electronics schemes, and software. Thankfully, we made it! Before our pitch at CES2019 we have already had a fully working prototype with complete Software and original electronics (only the frame details were custom made).In January we revealed our creation on the world's largest Tech conference in the USA, where we got acquainted with Funded Today crowdfunding agency and decided that Indiegogo is the most suitable funding option for our project.Back home we started with a pre-launching campaign:NOW WE ARE HERE! WE ARE SUPER STOKED TO PRESENT PHOTON LIGHT MODULE SYSTEM TO ALL OF YOU!  Our team is a tight-knit tech international startup with members from the USA, Ukraine, and China.We have many types of specialists in different fields: electronics, developers, sales and marketing managers.We are a strong team of passionate engineers and designers who are experienced professional open-source hardware, industrial design, and photography. Our passion is all about creating products that help bring ideas and creativity to life.We have been working hard to make Photon LMS a reality.  We would like to express gratitude to all friends, supporters, backers and team members!  We unveiled Photon LMS to Tech World at CES 2019 in fabulous Las Vegas. It was a great event to start a campaign!This way or another, our product was among the projects that set the course of the industry over the year. Participating in CES was an amazing experience that left us in WOWs, opening up opportunities to meet numerous likeminded individuals.Although there are many other reasons why you'd end up loving CES.As of now, we are READY to HIT the market!THANKS FOR SUPPORT!         Risks and challengesAny project might encounter unexpected obstacles, and this possibility is even more likely in the case of a hardware technology project that requires manufacturing.

<p>We have begun two new works to honor the work of photographic artist Kenro Izu.  With the help of Angels such as yourself we will produce both a Fine Press Edition and a Trade Press Edition (aka ""coffee table"" book). While you are all familiar with coffee table books, the genre of Fine Press Editions is more rare and most people have never seen one - they are more elusive, typically residing in the Special Collections area of libraries and other institutions. For examples of each, have a look here at earlier Veritas Editions-produced <a href=""https://www.veritaseditions.com/#/lusitano/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Trade Press</a> and <a href=""https://www.veritaseditions.com/#/the-spirit-within-australia/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Fine Press</a> books.</p>

<h3>Why this project now?</h3>
<p>On November 25th, 2020, Kenro Izu marked the beginning of  his 50th year of pursuing his dream while living in America. In Kenro's words ""It was Thanksgiving night in 1971 when I arrived at Port Authority on a Greyhound bus. The illuminated Empire State Building on 34th Street shone through the fog. I was finally in New York, the city I had dreamed of before leaving Japan. At the time, New York was the only place where photography was taken seriously as an art form. I had studied photography at an art college in Tokyo, but in Japan photography was merely a form of media reproduced in magazines or, on selected occasions, in books. There was little interest or value in the sale and collection of original photographic prints. During my studies, I read about the Family of Man exhibition in 1955 at New York’s Museum of Modern Art. It moved me tremendously. I also read about galleries in New York that exhibited and sold photographs as art. That was where I wanted to be.""</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1608348321/nhbffveqt2zmydpw4bgj.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We noticed the art of Kenro at the Alternative Process International Symposium on July 21, 2007 in Santa Fe. Kenro presented ""Kenro Izu - The master of composition and platinum printing"", and later that evening we saw more of his work in an exhibition at the Anahita Photography Gallery in Santa Fe. We carefully stored that experience into our memory banks. Fast forward to 2018, when that memory came alive again. Veritas Editions was just 3 years young, and we approached Kenro with the concept of these two books. We are very grateful he accepted, and he is deeply engaged in these projects as we continue in image selection, design and text.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Howard Greenberg noticed Kenro much earlier,  and writes in August 2020 ""Kenro Izu is a very special person. He is an enormously gifted photographer, craftsman, and navigator of this Earth. He has willed himself to be faithful to his vision and to humanity. His accomplishments are many, and his effect on others has been profound and lasting. His body of work is monumental in its revelation of ancient spirits embodied in stone, the kind of stone that has been removed from below us and turned into form and structure over thousands of years. And his reverence for light and its visual effect on all the substances of our world achieve a spiritual quality similar to the ancient stones, and flowers, and human forms he photographs.""</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1608388172/rrouiznlq8gleajpqzk9.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Long-time friend and mentor Eikoh Hosoe writes of Kenro ""My appreciation of Izu as a photographer stems not only from my admiration of the technical quality of his printing, but also from my understanding of the vision that has guided his career as an artist. It is a vision of the beauty in all things, which he often seeks out in places where it is perhaps most fragile: a flower whose fullness lasts but days, if not only hours; an ancient temple in Angkor, decaying and broken with the passage of time and half-consumed by the nature around it; the rituals of death on the banks of the Ganges River in India. But his true goal is not just what is seen through the lens of the camera or on a printed piece of paper. It is a spiritual beauty that can only be experienced in a more abstract sense.""</p> <h3>What We Need and What You Get</h3>
<p>The design effort for both Fine Press and Trade Press is presently around 80% completed, with plans for completion this Spring, funds willing. We have chosen our production partners based on the skill set needed as well as past performance. Every Veritas Editions book has won significant awards in the art photography book category. Projects like this are a collaborative effort, similar in concept to the African proverb ""It takes a village to raise a child"".  These editions are indeed like our children in many ways - we take great care in raising them and then we turn them loose into the world.</p>
<p>Production for the Fine Press is planned to begin in January and finish up by April. Just 20 numbered, 12 lettered, and 1 Hors de Commerce books are planned.</p>
<p>Production for the Trade Press book is planned to begin in March and be completed in May. The relative success of this fundraising will impact how many books are produced. If we meet our minimum goal of $9609, we should be able to produce 1500 books, 100 of which will be made into signed Limited Editions with print.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Budget</h3>Projected direct cost to produce these two fine volumes is $164,000. We are seeking to fund 50% or $82,000 of these projects through a combination of crowd-sourcing and other pre-sales.  Crowd-sourcing so far has contributed about $33,000, leaving $49,000 or more needed from this campaign and other pre-sales to make these books a reality in the style they deserve.<p> </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Let us not ignore the role art can play in our world. Art can bring joy to the soul.  We want to bring more of that joy into peoples' lives, enriching and inspiring their own creativity. Our hope is the creativity of Kenro Izu will form a virtuous cycle with all who touch it and with all who it touches.</p>

<p>Shooting Sicily workshop combines two fundamental elements of my life, photography and Sicily. An experience that aims at the possibility of discovering the island from a different perspective from the ordinary, less stereotyped and wider. I will take you to visit some exclusive places in north-eastern Sicily and, under my guidance, we will try to get the best out of each place using every possible photographic technique.</p>

<p>This initiative aims to be a springboard towards a network of photographic experiences on the island. It is the first of a long series of photographic events with the aim of educating and disseminating photographic knowledge and culture.</p>

<h3>WHAT I NEED &amp; WHAT YOU GET</h3>
<p><strong>Why I need you:</strong></p>
<p>I need your help to reach the 8K goal that will give sustainability and feasibility to the whole project. This sum is designed to cover the travel costs to and from the workshop locations, the cost of accomodation and all meals with traditional Sicilian dishes. My aim is to guarantee the right attention and comfort to the training and the activities.</p>
<p>If the first and initial goal is reached then the new goal will be 16K.</p>
<p>With that amount of money I want to buy new tools and offer more services to support the coursists needs.</p>
<p>For instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>An off-road vehicle to reach secluded places</li>
<li>A supply of photographic easels available to each participant;</li>
<li>Photo filter kit to experiment with your creativity.</li>
</ul>

<p>A workshop is forever! The events of the last few years have showed us that travelling can sometimes be difficult or even impossible due to force majeure! All Shooting Sicily workshops are guaranteed with <strong><u>no time limit</u></strong>.

<h3>THE LOCATIONS</h3>
<h3>Nebrodi</h3>
<p>The Nebrodi Park is the largest protected area in Sicily, limited to the north by the Tyrrhenian Sea, to the west by the Madonie, to the east by Etna and to the south by the Simeto drainage basin.</p>
<p>The largest natural forests in Sicily extend over the Nebrodi. The exposure of the slopes, the altitude, the different types of soil influence the vegetation of the Park, making it amazingly rich and fascinating in every season of the year.</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>Argimusco</h3>
<p>It is one of the most characteristic rock complexes in the southern Italy that extends in the province of Messina near the village of Montalbano Elicona and the Bosco di Malabotta Nature Reserve. Thousand-year-old stones, with anthropomorphic and zoomorphic shapes, have been modeled by the hand of man and by atmospheric agents and are arranged on a vast terrain where it is possible to observe Etna, the Aeolian islands, the sky and the uncontaminated stars for a unique and unrepeatable view.</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>Milazzo</h3>
<p>The old village and the castle are the entrance of a path that winds along the promontory of Capo Milazzo between the two sides of west and east. The track, characterized by the typical Mediterranean scrub, rich in prickly pears and olive trees, develops through a suggestive stone climbing that ends at the lake of Venus, a natural swimming pool set in a panoramic cliff.</p>

</div></div>","Shooting Sicily workshop combines two fundamental elements of my life, photography and Sicily. An experience that aims at the possibility of discovering the island from a different perspective from the ordinary, less stereotyped and wider. I will take you to visit some exclusive places in north-eastern Sicily and, under my guidance, we will try to get the best out of each place using every possible photographic technique.

This initiative aims to be a springboard towards a network of photographic experiences on the island. It is the first of a long series of photographic events with the aim of educating and disseminating photographic knowledge and culture.
---

WHAT I NEED & WHAT YOU GET
Why I need you:
I need your help to reach the 8K goal that will give sustainability and feasibility to the whole project. This sum is designed to cover the travel costs to and from the workshop locations, the cost of accomodation and all meals with traditional Sicilian dishes. My aim is to guarantee the right attention and comfort to the training and the activities.
If the first and initial goal is reached then the new goal will be 16K.
With that amount of money I want to buy new tools and offer more services to support the coursists needs.
For instance:

An off-road vehicle to reach secluded places
A supply of photographic easels available to each participant;
Photo filter kit to experiment with your creativity.

 
What I can give you:

A workshop is forever! The events of the last few years have showed us that travelling can sometimes be difficult or even impossible due to force majeure! All Shooting Sicily workshops are guaranteed with no time limit. If for any reason it will be impossible to attend the event, contact the responsable to program another workshop in the next available dates.

Yes, there are other studios available for rent, but they will come with limited equipment.

<h2>Short Summary</h2>
<p>Hello! Thank you for taking the time to visit my crowdfunding campaign. My name is Jessica, a small town girl residing in Sacramento, CA, and opening a photography rental studio in Midtown Sacramento. Photography is a keen interest for me. It is my passion, and since 2008, I have developed myself into a lifestyle photographer. I put more of an interest in my photography attending school, working in art galleries, and well-known camera supply stores. I have dedicated my time and energy for the past 12 years to learn everything I can about photography. I am ready to share my education and experience with others by opening a fully equipped studio that will be available for rent.</p>

<p> </p>
<h2>Sacramento And The Community</h2>
<p>Sacramento, CA, is the most thriving city with creative people everywhere. The diversity and creativity are so welcoming. I could not be more enthusiastic to give back to the photography community. This studio is my opportunity, and I am ready to take advantage. I want photographers like myself to do what they love and love what they do. </p>

<h3> </h3>
<h2>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h2>
<p>Studio 64 will be a fully equipped photography rental studio. It will give the artist the possibility and properties to grasp their goals and cultivate as a better artist. My goal is to provide the tools any form of photographer or videographer would need to achieve his or her dreams. Achieving this goal will include tips, lessons, and lectures on photography, along with staying equipped with the latest technology and giving exceptional customer service. </p>
<p>All money raised will go to the purchasing of equipment needed. For Example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lighting</li>
<li>Background stands and backdrops</li>
<li>Computers for editing</li>
<li>Props</li>
<li>Furniture</li>
<li>Office supplies</li>

<h3> </h3>
<h2>How Will It Work?</h2>
<p>Customers will make reservations on an hourly or full-day basis. The best part, there is no credit card or deposit needed! The hours are from 10 am to 6 pm Monday-Friday. The studio will offer three departments: an all-white room primarily used for photography, a green room for video or photo, and a media station for editing. The rooms will provide lighting, stands, backdrops, props, etc. The media station will consist of a Mac and PC, which will have the current editing software installed. For example, Adobe Lightroom, Adobe Photoshop, and Adobe Final Cut Pro. All this at one low affordable price. If booking the whole day, customers will qualify for a fantastic discount. Bottom line, I want to help others reach their goals without worrying about the cost.</p>

<h3>Humanitarian wedding photographer shifts focus to expose beauty found in the shadows of the streets.</h3>
<p>I had achieved far more than I had dreamed.</p>
<p>I had an outwardly beautiful life. Faith, family, and finances. I had a 20 year career as a wedding photographer that exceeded my wildest expectations. And yet, I couldn't shake this deep knowing within me that there had to be <i>more</i> to this life than simply achieving the American Dream I had once put my faith in.</p>
<h3>Midlife crisis becomes clarity</h3>
<p>Confusion set in and I journeyed outside of my comfort zone to find answers. From missions trips to meditation to Burning Man. For seven years, the more I searched, the less interested I became in remaining a wedding photographer. As my career was unwinding, so was my 20 year marriage which ended in Dec 2013. Instead of buying the cliche midlife Corvette, I bought a motorhome and began a road trip that would take Denise (then my girlfriend - now my wife) and I through all 48 continental United States over the next seven years.</p>
<h3>It all started with a Free Hug</h3>
<p>Our love story began on February 14th, 2014 when we moved into our motorhome with an intention to slow down. I set a leisurely course for New Orleans to photograph Mardi Gras. Upon arrival, I was wearing a ""Free Hugs"" t-shirt. Surprisingly, many streets kids wanted to hug me. My heart stirred and, for the next 3 days, I wore the same t-shirt and hugged more kids. </p>
<p>Days after we left NoLa, my heart whispered ""Go back to New Orleans and start photographing the ""dirty kids"" (their self given name). After my initial resistance, I agreed to go back. The arms of the community I thought would be closed and guarded were wide open and welcoming.</p>
<p>Over the next few years, Denise and I would search for dirty kids in the cities we traveled too. We have sat with, traveled with, listened too, ate with, drank with, and photographed hundreds of traveling dirty kids around the country.</p>
<p>This first book of a planned trilogy represents the Spirit &amp; Wisdom of a nomadic tribe that few outsiders understand. These kids have welcomed and accepted me as one of their own. I introduce them now to you. I am honored to present this collection of black &amp; white images for your visual enjoyment/curiosity and, perhaps, deeper contemplation.</p>

<h3>Dope Photography for a Higher Purpose</h3>
</div><div>
<p>We see the sales from DIRTY KIDS used to fund 3 levels of healing</p>
<ul>
<li>$11K raised will get the book printed and shipped. Level 1 will honor the kids I have photographed. **Many of the kids in the book will get as a signed copy as a gift. And it's small enough to easily fit in a back pack.  </li>
<li>$22K raised will print the book and begin a cross country tour this spring. I will be discussing modern faith and outreach, homelessness, addiction, foster care, and the wisdom of the Prodigal Journey with influential misfits - spiritual teachers, authors, activists and artists. </li>
<li>$33k raised will cover the book, the tour, and an epic documentary film.</li>
<li>Ultimately [with images and words] we hope to change perceptions of the homeless from one of FEAR to one of LOVE. Simply acknowledging our common humanity starts by making eye contact, offering spare change, a kind word, or sharing a smile goes a long way toward a more compassionate community. I would suggest that most of these travelers are running away from deep pain that they do not have the tools or support to heal on their own. Many are trapped deep in addiction. We invite you to be a part of the solution! By giving of your time, talents, and treasures you give (&amp; receive) healing in return. Our indifference and judgements of the homeless indicate a closed or constricted heart. By lovingly blessing others, our hearts soften and eventually expand. But be warned, once your heart is opened you may find yourself on a sidewalk or on a park bench sharing a meal with them. I wonder if this is the experience Jesus had with ""the sinners, drunkards and prostitutes""? We believe these dirty kids, lost boys, and outcasts are the contemporary Prodigal Sons and Daughters of our time. They don't need to be preached too, they simply need to feel welcomed..... home.</li>
</ul>
</div><div><h3> </h3></div><div>
<h3>WE &gt; ME I am grateful for your loving support.</h3>
<p>Denise and I hope to inspire new ambassadors of love among the homeless. Will you join us?</p>
<p>With your partnership, we can collectively create healing.  The book is the next step toward this vision.</p>
<p>There are many ways to help spread the good news about the Dirty Kids book. Against all sane advice, I am launching a book during a pandemic, without an email list, reaching out to friends we know! Early supporters, we need your help.</p>
<p>Would you get the word out and make some noise about DIRTY KIDS in any way you can?</p>
<p>Please purchase a book or two. For every book you purchase, we give one to a dirty kid.</p>
<p>Thank you. Warmest blessings, Joe + Denise</p>

We see the sales from DIRTY KIDS used to fund 3 levels of healing

$11K raised will get the book printed and shipped. Level 1 will honor the kids I have photographed. **Many of the kids in the book will get as a signed copy as a gift. And it's small enough to easily fit in a back pack.  
$22K raised will print the book and begin a cross country tour this spring. I will be discussing modern faith and outreach, homelessness, addiction, foster care, and the wisdom of the Prodigal Journey with influential misfits - spiritual teachers, authors, activists and artists. 
$33k raised will cover the book, the tour, and an epic documentary film.
Ultimately [with images and words] we hope to change perceptions of the homeless from one of FEAR to one of LOVE. Simply acknowledging our common humanity starts by making eye contact, offering spare change, a kind word, or sharing a smile goes a long way toward a more compassionate community. I would suggest that most of these travelers are running away from deep pain that they do not have the tools or support to heal on their own. Many are trapped deep in addiction. We invite you to be a part of the solution! By giving of your time, talents, and treasures you give (& receive) healing in return. Our indifference and judgements of the homeless indicate a closed or constricted heart. By lovingly blessing others, our hearts soften and eventually expand. But be warned, once your heart is opened you may find yourself on a sidewalk or on a park bench sharing a meal with them. I wonder if this is the experience Jesus had with ""the sinners, drunkards and prostitutes""? We believe these dirty kids, lost boys, and outcasts are the contemporary Prodigal Sons and Daughters of our time. They don't need to be preached too, they simply need to feel welcomed..... home.

 
WE > ME I am grateful for your loving support.
Denise and I hope to inspire new ambassadors of love among the homeless. Will you join us?
With your partnership, we can collectively create healing.  The book is the next step toward this vision.
There are many ways to help spread the good news about the Dirty Kids book. Against all sane advice, I am launching a book during a pandemic, without an email list, reaching out to friends we know! Early supporters, we need your help.
Would you get the word out and make some noise about DIRTY KIDS in any way you can?
Please purchase a book or two. For every book you purchase, we give one to a dirty kid.
Thank you. Warmest blessings, Joe + Denise",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

<div>My name is Jade Brewer and I am an emerging photographer and recent grad of Montserrat College of Art in Massachusetts. I first started shooting when I was a kid, burning through camera after disposable camera until I decided that I wanted to it for the rest of my life. I became completely immersed in my art and truly established who I was as an artist and where I wanted to go with it when I did the study abroad program to Viterbo, Italy. I was bitten by the travel bug. Travel photography became my dream and passion. </div>
<div>The project began as my thesis project, <i>Five Years. </i>I photographed all of the places I have lived through out my life. Considering that I have never lived anywhere more than five years, I managed to fill my entire senior year with nostalgic trips all over New Hampshire. They show the relationship with memory and place over time, intentionally becoming less inhabited the farther back in time I went in my memory.</div>
<div><h3>Now and the Future</h3></div>
<div>The pictures ended up becoming more than I could have ever expected, showing quite a few times including my first solo exhibition this past January. </div>
<div>My plans for the ""spinoff"" series Hometown is to visit my friends that I have amassed all over the world and photograph their home towns from their perspective. The  first step of this project is going to take place in Cape Town, South Africa, photographing the childhood town of my friends Kate and Sean for fourteen days. My goal is to complete a photo book following them as they show me the most important and intimate places from their childhoods. If all goes well the project will continue into the Philippines, Slovakia, Turkey, and Romania.   </div> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>As an emerging professional, I work out of my house. I have a basic setup that I love and gets the job done. The purpose of the funds is to take me to Africa, and provide the ability to travel around the country. Any extra money will be put towards helping out my friends who are providing housing to me while I am there as well as food and other living expenses. This will also allow me the financial room to keep up with my expenses back home while I am out of work for the trip. Also some of the money will go towards producing the book and making copies for you! Any funding received above the amount listed of $2500 will be donated to Camfed; a charity that helps women and girls in marginalized areas of Africa receive an education.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>The funds will allow me to go on my first ever travel expedition for my work. This is step one in building a career in travel photography for myself and broadening my horizons as a person. I would like to take my work in a direction where I can use it to help and impact others in a positive way. Raising more funds than projected will directly impact children in Africa by providing money directly to charities that will help them.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>Challenges I may face through out the trip will be related to technology and making sure I have the appropriate materials and insurances for my equipment. Right now I have everything I need to make this happen except the plane ticket. Risks include making sure my finances are secure enough to make this trip happen, but with your help I will be able to do it.</p>

<br/>Hello!<br/><br/>Jacob and Miriam are two passionate individuals. You will barely ever see Jacob without a camera in front of his face  and Miriam will often disappear into her notebook, scribbling poetry.</h3>
<p>They have both been working prolifically over the past few years, creating and coming up with projects.

Based primarily out of Jackson Wyoming, we operate our professional workshops exclusively in the 22+ million acre Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, often considered ""one of the last remaining intact ecosystems"" in the northern temperate zone.</p><p>Federally managed ( public land that belongs to all of us) areas that are within the GYE include:</p><ul>
<li>National Park Service: Yellowstone National Park, Grand Teton National Park, and Glacier National Park in Montana, as well as various other surrounding public lands.</li>
<li>US National Forest Service : Gallatin, Custer, Caribou-Targhee, Bridger-Teton and Shoshone National Forests.</li>
<li>United States Fish &amp; Wildlife Service (USFWS) includes the famous 22,000 acre National Elk Refuge</li>
<li>Ten distinct National Wilderness Areas have been established within the GYE's National Forests since 1966, mandating the highest level of habitat protection that the USFS uses.</li>
<li>The GYE also encompasses a great deal of privately held lands surrounding those managed by the U.S. Government. </li>
</ul><p>This is the area where many of our professional instructors have gained their great depth of knowledge and years through operating and having usually lived here for many years, including myself (bio to follow). It is this level of intimacy and familiarity with the area that enables us to create a unique niche amongst photography workshops nationwide, many that offer workshops here in the GYE but otherwise do not actually live here.</p><p> </p><p>    We bring you the most up to date information on wildlife: the latest sighting of well known and beloved  grizzly bears (such as Raspberry and Blondie), where the wolves of Yellowstone were last seen, and so much more--and of course we also know the deep complexities, challenges, and politics of the region topped off with local lore, natural history and colorful stories that just cant be  known by non-regional photographers.

As you were setting up just here a few minutes ago, the sun went behind the clouds again blanketing the scene with less contrast and a flat sky.  Of course, you know that all outdoor photographers will come to face this type of situation, so you stand patiently waiting for that optimal moment.</p><p>   And then it happens: A big beautiful bull moose walks into the scene and begins to wade across the small pond. The challenge is quickly apparent as you fire off a few funky test shots as he wades across the pond: You know your camera is going to not quite pull this off without some kind of intervention: The moose is happening but the light is not!</p><p>   Not for long, though: Your Lightchaser photography instructor is standing right next to you and says: ""Ok everyone this is what we are going to do-given that we don't have much time or good light let’s aim those lenses and start shooting.""</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>~Let your light-chasing adventure begin~</strong></p><p align=""center""> </p><p>   <strong>Lightchasers Photography Adventures, </strong>though<strong> </strong>based in Jackson Wyoming, reaches out to the photographers that are a significant part of the always growing multi-billion dollar travel and adventure tourism industry. From Jackson and Cody, Wyoming to Bozeman, Montana and Banff in Canada, we have the region covered with a wide variety of workshops ranging from 1/2 day excursions into the Tetons to multi-day wildlife adventures in Yellowstone, or we can be found chasing the light of the beautiful turquoise lakes ad skies of Glacier National Park.</p><p>     Your photography guide also has relevant and unbiased knowledge of the current politics and complex ecological and stewardship challenges surrounding the vast flora and fauna, as well as the natural resources of the multi-state region of Montana, Idaho, and Wyoming (and to a lesser extent, Utah and Canada).</p><p>    A great deal of this ecosystem centers around the 11,000 cubic miles of 4000+ degree lava underneath Yellowstone, one of the 7 super-volcanoes in the world, and also crazily embraces the highest elevations of the United States: the 3000+ mile long Continental Divide runs right through it all.  Snows and rains that fall on the east end west sides of the CD are the primary source of 4 of the 5 major rivers in the US, creating an incredibly unique and diverse ecosystem. The Continental divide is also  where the highest snowfalls in the US occur, all the way up to 1100 inches in record years. Countless streams, rivers, and lakes are the direct result of all this precipitation, and naturally all species of the region need this water -and the cleanest air in the US, usually-to survive. Thus, there is no other place on our planet that is both relatively easily accessible by humans (for the most part) and is yet so sparsely populated by us and still blessed with often untouched wildlands.  Its an amazing, soul changing place-and I never get tired of it...</p><p>    This, then, is what Lightchasers knows and loves so well, and we endeavor with sharp passion and cutting edge professionalism to share and explore it with our students.</p><p align=""center""> </p><p align=""center""><strong>Now lets get to why Lightchaser is seeking funding:</strong></p><p align=""center"">Initial startup costs include the following:</p><p align=""center""> </p><p align=""center""><strong>Phase 1:  </strong>Immersion of the Chief Visionary Officer (thats me) in the dynamic, challenging and rewarding business <strong>Startup Intensive</strong> right here in Jackson, Wyoming.

Based primarily out of Jackson Wyoming, we operate our professional workshops exclusively in the 22+ million acre Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, often considered ""one of the last remaining intact ecosystems"" in the northern temperate zone.Federally managed ( public land that belongs to all of us) areas that are within the GYE include:
National Park Service: Yellowstone National Park, Grand Teton National Park, and Glacier National Park in Montana, as well as various other surrounding public lands.
US National Forest Service : Gallatin, Custer, Caribou-Targhee, Bridger-Teton and Shoshone National Forests.
United States Fish & Wildlife Service (USFWS) includes the famous 22,000 acre National Elk Refuge
Ten distinct National Wilderness Areas have been established within the GYE's National Forests since 1966, mandating the highest level of habitat protection that the USFS uses.
The GYE also encompasses a great deal of privately held lands surrounding those managed by the U.S. Government. 
This is the area where many of our professional instructors have gained their great depth of knowledge and years through operating and having usually lived here for many years, including myself (bio to follow). It is this level of intimacy and familiarity with the area that enables us to create a unique niche amongst photography workshops nationwide, many that offer workshops here in the GYE but otherwise do not actually live here.     We bring you the most up to date information on wildlife: the latest sighting of well known and beloved  grizzly bears (such as Raspberry and Blondie), where the wolves of Yellowstone were last seen, and so much more--and of course we also know the deep complexities, challenges, and politics of the region topped off with local lore, natural history and colorful stories that just cant be  known by non-regional photographers. More than just a photography workshop, Lightchaser Photo Adventures are a truly intimate and diversified look at the deep nuances and incredible variety that this vast and wild area offers.    There are countless opportunities for intriguing excursions, safaris, and adventures to not only the famous and iconic scenes, such as Old Faithful or Going to the Sun Highway in Glacier NP, to many lesser known-and less crowded- places.Here is a sample of potential workshops:1:  The Living Landscapes of Grand Teton National Park2: Some Like it Hot: Geothermal Wonders of Yellowstone3: Take Your Best Shots: Composition That Rocks4: The Amazing Critters of Yellowstone5: Wild about Wildflowers of The Tetons6: Falling for the Fall Colors of Glacier…and many more… Lets go on a short little photography adventure first, thoughSo: picture this:   You’re standing in an open expanse of sagebrush meadows and colorful wildflowers with a stunning backdrop of rugged, snow-capped mountains reflected in the still waters of a small pond just in front of you and your group of fellow photographers.

This is where the film/video/tv component of my life came alive. Much more detail about my interesting and never boring journey into the world of film, editing and camera work that has now resulted in three different national broadcast opportunities :The Outdoor Channel, The World Fishing Network and a pending 2017 PBS show which can be found here: http://www.media-match.com/usa/media/cv/www.michaelgphotoandvideo.com Most recently:I currently live and work as a professional tour guide into Grand Teton and Yellowstone National Parks through Grizzly Country Wildlife Adventures, based out of Jackson, Wyoming where I have guided well over 1000 people and photographers into these amazing places and beyond over the past 4 years. I also worked at a guest ranch up high on the Continental divide for 2 years, where I was a professional bartender, part time photography tour guide, taught and guided fly-fishing, a hiking guide, sous chef, and all around ranch hand. Fun stuff. Theres a lot more, but you are not  here to learn about me as you are here to learn about Lightchasers Photography Adventures.  Finally: Lightchaser Photography Adventures comes alive    The idea of a School of Film and Photography has been with me for several years, and in a place like Jackson, Wyoming, with so much to offer outdoor-wise with nearly 22 millions acres of wild and public lands within a 2 minute to a 10 hour drive, plus a town that is surprisingly dynamic for its size, and a respectable airport nearby, Jackson is the ultimate place for the launching of Lightchaser Photography Adventures.    The unique focus of LPA is the intimacy that our seasoned instructors have within the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, many of whom have-like myself-been here for a multitude of years, photographing guiding and exploring all over the GYE.    These workshops, seminars, and even multiday safaris are more than just excursions into the wilds with a camera: they are also a deeper connection with  the natural and human history of the area, the continuing successes and challenges that species such as the grizzly bears and wolves of the GYE face with their amazing comeback stories, mixed in with local lore and exciting visits to out of the way places that few other photo workshop companies even know about.    And finally: All who donate over the $50 level will be listed as Founding Members in perpetuity. Pretty cool, huh?Thank You!! (And please dont hesitate to ask questions, provide suggestions at how I can make this campaign and Lightchaser Photo Adventures even better!) ~Let’s get out there and get our passion for photography into focus~  Any and all donations will be met with exceptional and heartfelt gratitude, and there is no doubt your role in the beginning of something like this is essential to getting it launched and successful!",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p><b>ABOUT</b></p>
<p>Shades of Color is a book that reflects the diversity of the
world we live in capturing the beauty, spirit, complexions, and complexities of
men. A book of empowerment, exposure, entertainment a response to what we don’t
see in our everyday lives… images  of Asian, Black, Latino, and White men.</p>

<p>Your support will help me raise money to fund a 216-page
photography book that I began creating five years ago. In a world that has
debated race, culture, religion, and gender through my camera lens I hope to
give you a glimpse of God's beauty in Shades of Color. I celebrate the subtle
complexions and complexities of men.</p>
<p> During my travels
across the United States, Europe, Africa, South America and Asia, I always
study popular images on magazine covers, billboard advertisements, fashion
layouts and the like. I look for images that resemble myself and communities of
color … I rarely find them. This book is, in part, a response to what I have
not seen. I want this book to be a reflection of the world we all inhabit. With
the election of America's first African American President, Barack Obama, I
hope everyone will look more carefully so as to move beyond racism, sexism and
homophobia. I pray that the children of today will experience a world where
power and beauty are not exclusively perceived as Caucasian, African, Asian or
Latin, but rather as a glorious celebration of all of God's Shades of Color.
After all, love is colorblind, so too is respect, admiration, kindness and
beauty.</p>

photographer/ publicist that has traveled the far corners of the world in a
devoted career that extends itself to the worlds of entertainment, art,
charitable foundations, religion, philanthropy, as well as covering social and
economic issues in Africa and America. My portfolio holds some of the world’s
most celebrated luminaries from<b><i> Destiny’s Child, Michael Jackson, Usher, Janet
Jackson, Regina King, Jessica Alba, Rihanna, Marcus Patrick, Steve Harvey to Rodney
Jerkins</i></b>. I began as a child taking polaroid’s of family and friends. I soon
found myself shooting weddings, headshots, and editorial. One day I met a young
actress name Regina King at an event to promote peace between the notorious
Crips and Bloods. She would ask me to shoot her wedding, at a time of my life
were I was searching for a career. Regina King’s guest list included the who’s
who of Hollywood. I would later be taken by Jon-John Robinson a music producer
to meet BabyFace and his wife Tracey Edmonds. I soon began shooting their
artist, Jon-B, Usher, Az-yet. Then one day Jamie Foster Brown the CEO of Sister
2 Sister magazine was at one of Clive Davis Grammy parties and asked me take a
photo of supermodel Tyson Bedford tattoo. She would later post the image and
offer me work and asked George Pitts photo Editor of Vibe magazine to give me
an opportunity. Over the years I have shot for Ebony, Jet, People, Source, BRE,
Q-magazine, Rollingout, and Vibe. God has taken me from an abused kid who loved
taking pictures to having my work seen internationally. I still feel a desire
to show our planet a more diverse image.

<p>I worked as a publicist for Roz Stevenson

<p>Ten years ago I felt the need to give back
to my community and help save the children. I started the Steven Williams
Foundation to help disadvantage youth and created panels entitled: “peace
through education.” With the help of celebrities and professionals like Edward
J. Olmos, Regina King, Tichina Arnold, Ray Santiago, Scrunchoos, Museum
Director Charmaine Jefferson and Carlos Barbosa. We have inspired our kids to
continue their education and reduce racial tension. </p>

2016. I have launched this campaign to raise money to defray the costs of a

<h3><strong>My life's work: photographing the fans of the World Cup</strong></h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1525674991/ysxmxx5ucwcte3ifzqwn.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>My name is Douglas Zimmerman, and I’m a photojournalist and soccer fanatic who has spent the past sixteen years documenting football fans at the FIFA World Cup.</p>
<p>The  World Cup is the most amazing happening in the world. No other event has the ability to bring together people from diverse backgrounds and different nationalities to celebrate their common passion.</p>
<p>My photo essay of the fans has become my life's work.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1527181539/fk5ujbcyjil06kpltkwx.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>As the 2018 event approaches, I plan to travel to Russia to complete my fan photography essay and self-publish a photo book of my images from the 2002 World Cup through this year.</p>
<p>To successfully finish my project, I need your assistance and support.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1527181371/zxs1ncfowj2gw0n0tjwx.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3><strong>Why Photograph Football (Soccer) Fans?</strong></h3>
<p>Football (Soccer) fans are often negatively profiled in the media. Sure there is hooliganism, violence, and intolerance associated with the sport, but the reality for the vast majority of fans is different.</p>
<p>I've discovered through fans mutual affection for 'the beautiful game,' their devotion to the sport has the ability to break down the walls that separate us helping us develop a greater understanding and awareness of one another.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1527181451/z7l7tdqjou2r4drnmzwe.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>For example, during the 2010 World Cup, I photographed a game between Serbia and Ghana. The Ghanaian fans could not be more different in how they supported their team than the Serbians. During one point of the game, security believed that one Serbian fan was causing trouble and tried to remove him from the stadium. The Ghanaian fans rushed to his aid and convinced security to let him stay. They were all there for the same reason, and they connected in their shared passion for their teams.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1525651969/gtsiwpspq6b2iwm9c5ev.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Soccer can bring us all <strong>together</strong>. And that is what I show in my photographs.</p>
<h3><strong>Why I need your assistance</strong></h3>
<p>I've primarily self-funded my photography project traveling to three World Cups across Asia, Europe, and Africa. In 2014, thanks to crowdfunding, I was able to continue my project covering the diversity of the soccer fans in America, as they experienced the FIFA World Cup from the United States.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1525674944/ib1t7ulbdcsofaeuy6jp.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>For the 2018 World Cup in Russia, I have secured a media credential but will have to pay my own way. I need a community of soccer fans to help me complete my work, and I ask for your support.</p>
<p><strong>Here is a breakdown of my costs:</strong></p>
<p>I hope to cover the costs involved with finishing my photography project.</p>
<p>Roughly half of the funds raised will help cover the cost to edit, design, publish, and distribute the photo book to the campaign's donors. The other half will go to my travel expenses to Russia which includes airfares, accommodations, and transportation.</p>
<p>My goal of $7,500 will cover my expenses.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1527181627/tkhoxbixvkynt6dk2vi5.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>For the Book:</p>
<p>To design, publish and distribute an initial printing of my 8x10 and 11x13 photo books will be $3000.</p>
<p>For my travel expenses for Russia (I will be traveling from June 10th - July 2nd):</p>
<p>Travel (Airfare to/from Russia; transportation around Russia) : $2300; Lodging : $1200, Meals and Incidental Expenses: $1000</p>

<p>I'm excited to finally finish my photography project and share it with all my supporters and the world. Thank you for helping me finish my project, and I appreciate any assistance that you can give.</p>
<p>Also if you can not contribute, please also share this campaign with any fellow soccer fanatics that you know.</p>
<p>Enjoy this summer’s World Cup!!!</p>

The  World Cup is the most amazing happening in the world. No other event has the ability to bring together people from diverse backgrounds and different nationalities to celebrate their common passion.
My photo essay of the fans has become my life's work.
As the 2018 event approaches, I plan to travel to Russia to complete my fan photography essay and self-publish a photo book of my images from the 2002 World Cup through this year.
To successfully finish my project, I need your assistance and support.

Why Photograph Football (Soccer) Fans?
Football (Soccer) fans are often negatively profiled in the media. Sure there is hooliganism, violence, and intolerance associated with the sport, but the reality for the vast majority of fans is different.
I've discovered through fans mutual affection for 'the beautiful game,' their devotion to the sport has the ability to break down the walls that separate us helping us develop a greater understanding and awareness of one another.
For example, during the 2010 World Cup, I photographed a game between Serbia and Ghana. The Ghanaian fans could not be more different in how they supported their team than the Serbians. During one point of the game, security believed that one Serbian fan was causing trouble and tried to remove him from the stadium. The Ghanaian fans rushed to his aid and convinced security to let him stay. They were all there for the same reason, and they connected in their shared passion for their teams.

Soccer can bring us all together. And that is what I show in my photographs.
Why I need your assistance
I've primarily self-funded my photography project traveling to three World Cups across Asia, Europe, and Africa. In 2014, thanks to crowdfunding, I was able to continue my project covering the diversity of the soccer fans in America, as they experienced the FIFA World Cup from the United States.
For the 2018 World Cup in Russia, I have secured a media credential but will have to pay my own way. I need a community of soccer fans to help me complete my work, and I ask for your support.
Here is a breakdown of my costs:
I hope to cover the costs involved with finishing my photography project.
Roughly half of the funds raised will help cover the cost to edit, design, publish, and distribute the photo book to the campaign's donors. The other half will go to my travel expenses to Russia which includes airfares, accommodations, and transportation.
My goal of $7,500 will cover my expenses.
For the Book:
To design, publish and distribute an initial printing of my 8x10 and 11x13 photo books will be $3000.
For my travel expenses for Russia (I will be traveling from June 10th - July 2nd):
Travel (Airfare to/from Russia; transportation around Russia) : $2300; Lodging : $1200, Meals and Incidental Expenses: $1000

I'm excited to finally finish my photography project and share it with all my supporters and the world. Thank you for helping me finish my project, and I appreciate any assistance that you can give.
Also if you can not contribute, please also share this campaign with any fellow soccer fanatics that you know.
Enjoy this summer’s World Cup!!!",8.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h2><strong>About </strong></h2>
<p>Le Monde Analogue is a community that welcomes analogue photography enthusiasts and features the high-quality analogue photography. We are dedicated to promoting the medium of analogue photography and the love for anticipation of the captured moments that arise from a developed photographic film. Our Facebook page serves as a platform for further development of the project described below.</p>
<p>We are two photographers who teamed up in order to build a project that would open the process of art creation to the streets, to people, in cities around the world. By this project, we promote a concept where installations of urban analog photographs are decorated with graphical art inspired by graffiti during a public performance.</p>
<p>The series of photos we aim to present is praise to everyday life in the street and to passion for rituals and small satisfactions. Photos are situated in different cities around Europe  – shrines for action, emotion and human drama. It is our intent to represent vibrancy, not in a single image, but in series of images, moments that never come alone but are blended together in a dramatic series. Main actors are everyday people revealed through trivial activities that create life in the constantly changing time frame and their dialogue with the city.</p>
<h2><strong>Why are we doing this?</strong></h2>
<p>We are highly motivated to achieve several goals:</p>
<p>-To encourage artists to join our group and to fulfill their potential working as strong individuals within a group moving towards a common goal;</p>
<p>-To bring creation of art to the streets, to make it accessible to people in the form of public performance;</p>
<p>-Artists will be inspired to join together in dynamic collaborations, rather than working on their own in isolation;</p>
<p>-Through exhibiting the graffiti decorated photographs via collaboration with a local artist, to display the local atmosphere, problems and dreams.</p>
<h2><strong>Event and Exhibition</strong></h2>
<p>After selection of photos, series of photos, printed in different sizes, will be put together into an installation of 3m x 2m rectangles, thereby creating a large canvas for the graffiti artist.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1536695494/fpa6zjztd0yhbi67cvxb.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The graffiti artist will draw sketches across the photographic installations in a live performance. We aim to collaborate with local artists who are perfect candidates to communicate the atmosphere in the local society, especially among the young people.</p>

<p>The images will function well together as parts of a single installation, as well as separated – like the artists that produced them. We aim to install the first performance and exhibition in Berlin, the city that is a home for many artists and where art is alive and present in the streets.</p>

<h2><strong>What will we do with the raised money? </strong></h2>
<p>This first performance is what we are collecting the funding for:</p>

<li>printing of the images,</li>
<li>purchasing of the materials,</li>
<li>necessary preparations like framing and installing the images,</li>
<li>material required for exhibiting the artwork,</li>

<h2><strong>The Impact</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Taking it further</strong></h3>
<p>Our long-term goal is not only to move this event around Europe, but also to spread such concept all over Europe. One of the things we dream about is having such performance in several cities at the same time with live streaming. Images will be for sale in order to accomplish the self-sustainability of the project.</p>
</div><div>
<h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2>
<p>One potential risk is that we are not able to find sufficient interest among local artists around Europe. The challenge we will face is to find local galleries interested in exhibiting the artwork.</p>
<p>However, we hope to mitigate both these risks by first gaining visibility for the project through social media during the fund raising stage, as well as by promoting the concept through our Facebook page Le Monde Analogue. In this way we hope to be able to inform and attract artists from other European cities to join us in this adventure immediately or during the later stages of the project.</p>

<p>My name is Kristen. I have recently returned from a year long stay in Cairo, Egypt. While living in Cairo, I was carrying out anthropological research for my recently completed master's thesis and working hard to understand the ins and outs of different social spaces. By contributing to this campaign, you will help me to create a photo exhibition and events that will facilitate a space for learning, art, discussion, and awareness related to Cairo and drawn from my experiences doing fieldwork.</p>
<p>Cairo has offered me a new sense of place and inspiration to attend to the relationships easily absorbed in the mass of urban life. These photographs and the stories that accompany them, illustrate the difficult to define relationships that Egyptians have to the streets, each other, and the rest of the world. They also illustrate my experience and the lens through which I was seeing and understanding all that was happening around me. </p>
<p>Each photo will be accompanied by a story that will help to produce a visual anthropology and an opportunity to learn. Not only will this project build an artistic space around my experiences and visual imagery of Cairo's current situation, it would also give me the opportunity to host events involving lectures, fundraisers, and storytelling.</p>
<p>Currently, there are multiple spaces interested in hosting the project! Chicago and Normal, Illinois and Geneva, Switzerland are a few. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need to Make it Happen: </h3>
<p>I'd love for you to help me make this happen. Unfortunately, printing and framing photos is not cheap. Neither is creating or using an exhibition space or hosting an event. For example, to use a gallery space in Chicago for one month, the cost is 1,200 US dollars! To professionally print and frame one large photo costs between 50-100 US dollars. With the money that is raised, I will print and frame a selection of photographs that I took and that I feel best represents some of the current social issues, cultural spaces, and local experiences, unique to my time working with a community of Egyptians who live under harsh and unjust conditions. </p>
<p><strong>Major costs include:</strong> the use of a gallery space, event space and time, printing of photos, framing photos, and transportation. </p>
<p>As a result of your support for the exhibition, your contribution would also play a role in a greater project. All of the profits raised from the exhibition will go towards a project or the support of an existing organization in Egypt. By contributing to this event, you will also be contributing to a greater opportunity support Egyptians from the communities where these photographs are drawn from. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Art serves as a way to teach and inspire - the impact of this project would be just that. This exhibition would give people the opportunity to understand a place in the world that is seldom talked about and often misunderstood. Perhaps now more than ever, it is important for us to create spaces that tell a human story and that foster a sense of empathy. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>It's understandable that making a monetary contribution isn't always easy. If you're not able to, no worries. Perhaps you can help in other ways! Please, spread the word. Post this campaign on your social media site and ask others to make a contribution. </p>
<p>If you know of any space that would be willing to host this project as an exhibition and event, please get in touch! </p>
<p>Since this project is about much more than my photos and the stories I have to accompany them (it's about experiential learning, an understanding of people and the world, growing a sense of empathy and compassion, having a sense of wonder, appreciating art and culture, and building a sense of global citizenship), I ask that you take some time to learn about the current situation in Egypt, the events that have unfolded since the 2011 revolution, the people, the culture, the challenges and the beauty of living in a space like Cairo. </p>

I’m Allen Crooks and I’m a film photographer based in Nova Scotia, Canada.
In Spring of 2016, I’ll be opening the only independent darkroom currently operating in the city of Halifax. I’ve decided that the time has come for analog photographers to have an affordable and accessible darkroom RIGHT HERE IN HALIFAX!!!! Photographers will be able to develop black and white film and make darkroom prints while connecting with others fuelled by the same passion.One of the most enjoyable experiences for me over the past 10 years in a shared darkroom space has been the collaboration and camaraderie that flourishes in this type of environment. This is my hope for this space and its members.My love of film photography is driving me to do this.  My passion for film photography will help to create a community within this facility.  At the darkroom, we’ll be teaching workshops on film processing, darkroom printing for beginners, as well as intermediate and advanced printing and toning techniques. The building where the darkroom will be located will have a shared event space.  We will use this space regularly for pop-up events such as Instant Film Workshops, Large Format Polaroid Portraits, Tintype Portraits, Print Sales and so on.  Also we will have a strong outreach to youth in the community with programs geared to engaging them in film photography as a means of creative expressive and engaging with others.Why Do I Need Your Support?To build a fully functional membership-based darkroom, in many ways, is a costly and risky endeavor. However, I am more than happy to take on the risks for the sake of bringing together an amazing group of photographers in Halifax.  Items such as ventilation, plumbing, construction of work spaces and enlarging equipment represent the major costs.  Additionally, a good inventory of chemistry for startup is another cost.  Furthermore, your contribution will help us to establish and sustain this facility in its formative years, helping us to ensure a long and sustainable future for the darkroom.Whats In It for You?Check out the variety of darkroom printed perks you can choose from as a thank you for your contribution. These include a wide range of items from a picturesque post card of Peggy’s Cove to a 20x24 framed darkroom print. The heart of analog photography is beating strong in Halifax, Nova Scotia, and I look forward to providing members with film processing and printing capabilities second; to none in Canada!Other Ways You Can HelpI realize that some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help.  Here are some other ways you can still show us some love:  Share the campaign as much as possible with friends and colleagues in your social media network.
 Don't forget you can use the Indiegogo share tools to spread the love! Or just copy and paste the link to share.
And last but not least; shoot lots of film!!!!   And that's all there is to it. My level of gratitude is off the chart; THANK YOU!!!!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Hello!</h3>
<p>My name is Ashley. I'm a single mother and a starving artist. The moment I heard the sound of the shutter on my first camera, I fell in love with photography. I had always wondered how someone could capture so much raw emotion and passion in a simple photo. Then I got my own camera, and I knew. I started up Five Elements Photography in 2015. My business immediately jumped off the ground and started growing. Shortly after moving to the Seattle area, I had all of my photography equipment stolen. After that, I contemplated just giving it up because of how much it was going to cost me to replace it all. However, instead of giving up something I loved so much, I chose to just start over. So here I am, starting back at the bottom with just a camera and a lens and one hell of an imagination. </p>
<p>This campaign will serve more than one purpose for me. It's my first actual professional project. The plan is to create something that can be shared easily and enjoyed by many. I'm taking an artistic approach to the collection, not just doing traditional pose and shoot portraits. It will include the beautiful, the simple, and the downright ugly and weird. This is my opportunity to show who I am and what I can do. This is my chance to be noticed in the art scene. </p>
<p>Any and all contributions will go towards making this whole project work, down to the very lens and lighting I use. Like I mentioned earlier, I've completely started over and seriously lack the tools that would make this happen anytime soon. Studio lights, a lens, costumes, makeup, etc. Once the photos have been taken and edited, I will assemble a high resolution, hardback book of the best shots. Once those are ready, and depending on funds, I anticipate on doing a gallery showing of the shots for the public. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need</h3>
<ul>
<li>Studio/Portrait lighting &amp; Backdrop - $200</li>
<li>Canon EF 85mm f/1.2L II USM Lens - $350</li>
<li>Costumes - $100</li>
<li>Makeup - $100</li>
<li>Photobooks - $150</li>
<li>Gallery Prints - $100 (Or whatever is left)</li>

<h3>What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>Printed &amp; signed copy of 5 photos</li>
<li>Access to digital collection</li>
<li>Updates along the way (If you want them!)</li>
</ul>
<p>If the goal is not met, all will still be okay! It just might take a tad longer...All funds are going to supplies. This project WILL happen! :)</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I can't promise my photography will be life changing and so influential that my name is remembered throughout history. However, I can promise that passion, energy, excitement, and soul will go into every photo taken. I'm always talking about what I wish I COULD do...this is me reaching out, ready to finally say this is what I am doing. I can't express enough how much this means to me. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>If the goal is met, I don't foresee too many risks. I feel like my biggest challenge is going to be scheduling enough time with models due to my busy day to day routines. If the goal is not met, then this process will be slowed down tremendously, and I'll have to do what I can with what I have until it's finished, hopefully without having to stop and start back up again. </p>

<h3>Why Poetic Portraits in the Mile High City? </h3>
<p>Hi there! My name is Khalisa Rae. I'm a author, poet, and an educator form North Carolina. I am also the co-founded of Athenian Press and Workshops in Wilmington, NC- a nonprofit &amp; publishing company for female writers. I have been hosting, competing, and volunteering for local, regional, and national level poetry slam competitions for over 7 years.  By far, my favorite competition is the National Poetry Slam- the largest &amp; most prestigious annual poetry slam festival in the U.S. This year, my partner Eric and I will be traveling to Denver, CO to compete and witness the awe-inspiring stories of hundreds- but we need your help. </p>
<p>Imagine thousands of poets from all walks of life, races, gender identities and beliefs gathering in a different city every year, sharing stories, rants, exhortations, and monologues about issues that thrill, excite, move, and engage an audience of hundreds of random people. Their only job is to convince 5 random judges from the audience that their piece was well-written and well performed.The awesome thing about slam is poet only have a microphone and their words. </p>

<p>The National Poetry Slam is not just a competition, but it is a well-organization festival orchestrated by a team of experts at National Poetry Slam Incorporated. The festival includes workshops that cover range from cultural identity, gender politics, to the craft of poetry. </p>
<p>The hosts of the workshops and many of the competing poets poets on the national scene have awe- inspiring stories, but also have reached a huge level of success- and I want to get the inside scoop. What sets the slam poetry apart is: the issues matter, the talent is at a higher caliber, and the achievements are great! </p>

<p>I got an idea to capture the commentary/ testimonies, and behind the scenes of competing poets and those participating in the festival this year. The National Poetry Slam is the Olympics of poetry slam and I plan to  capture the special moments of it. Some of my poetry heroes are attending, and I do not want to miss the opportunity to learn, to grow, and to be changed by them. </p>

<h2>What Do You Get in Return?</h2>
<p>I don't want to ask for this money without giving you something awesome in return, so I have some pretty great (in my humble opinion) perks available! If you donate, I will :</p>
<p>1) give you a copy of my poetry book, Real Girls Have Real Problems</p>
<p>2)  give you a Real Girls Real Problems glossy poster </p>
<p>3) poetic postcards- poems I've already written on cool post cards= broad sides. </p>
<p>4) I will send you Real Girls Real Problems or Poetic Portraits in the Mile High City buttons</p>
<p>5) I will name my first born after you</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(I probably can't do that last thing, but I'll send you a homemade card in the mail too if you want.) </p>
<p>Going to NPS this year means a lot to me. It's a chance for me to be mentally, and emotionally stimulated, to connect with like-minded individuals, to connect with peers and mentors, but also to learn from educational workshop leaders and organizers. As someone who is starting their own non-profit and aspires to host a festival, this experience is invaluable. Even besides all of that: I love poetry. It's one of, if not the most important thing in my life. The community I've found through slam has greatly shaped who I am today. </p>
<p>Thank you a million times in advance for your generosity! If you're not in a place to donate, sharing on social media is also incredibly helpful. &lt;3 &lt;3 </p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Hi. My name is Matt Roberts and I am an Englishman who packed up his life and moved across the big pond to the United States of America ten years ago. An Englishman who considers himself very fortunate to have landed and settled in Long Beach, California, without doubt one the US's most diverse cities.</p>
<p>For the last six of those years, inspired by Brandon Stanton's Humans of New York I have been running a blog called Humans of Long Beach. This entails me jumping on my bicycle, cycling to all corners of the city, photographing the people I happen upon and, from our ensuing conversations getting them to hopefully reveal things about themselves to the world they otherwise wouldn't.</p>
<p>When I first started Humans of Long Beach people would say to me that a book would be a good idea but it wasn't really a suggestion I took with any seriousness until about three years ago when I met a young man named Chris whilst out and about doing my thing. Chris convinced me he could be the person to help me put it all together and now three years down the line I'm very proud and pleased to say Humans of Long Beach, the book is finally here.</p>
<p>We all love people watching, we've all said at one time or another 'I'm just watching the world go by.' Well for me Humans of Long Beach is people watching of the highest order because not only do you get to watch in the form of the hundreds of photographs that adorn the pages of the book, you also get to listen to the voices behind those faces in the anecdotes and stories that accompany them. </p>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Humans of Long Beach, the book will be a strictly limited edition. Once they're gone they're gone, and this is your chance to guarantee ownership of this remarkable tribute to the people of a remarkable city. </p>
<p>If there is one thing I didn't know that I sure know now when I set out on my journey to create this book it is this. That producing a book of this nature costs a lot of money and with my outlay for design, printing and proofing currently approaching $9,000 this crowdraiser is not only an opportunity for you guys to pre-order thus ensuring you get a copy delivered to your door before Christmas but also a thinly veiled attempt to claw my bank balance out of the red.</p>
<ul><li>The perks (for that is what they call them) associated with this fundraiser are naturally centered around the the city of Long Beach, California. From a postcard expressing your love for the city to the opportunity to provide each of the cities 12 libraries with a permanent tribute to the people who frequent them. Your very own gift to the people.</li></ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>In the six years I've been photographing and talking to the people of Long Beach I have come across people from all walks of life, from millionaire's to those living on the breadline and below and it is those people, the cities homeless population whose plight I have often attempted to expose. With that in mind <strong>I am going to be donating $5 of every book sale to a Long Beach charity associated with helping the cities less fortunate residents.</strong> The charity will be decided via the Humans of Long Beach Facebook page.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Book</h3>
<p>Humans of Long Beach, the book, will be a 312 paged hardback book containing over 450 photographs accompanied by 400 anecdotes and stories from the residents of the city with a foreword penned by the cities Mayor, Robert Garcia, and a preface provided by another Long Beach luminary, Community Action Team leader Justin Rudd.</p>
<p>The perks related to the book show postage and packing as extras but that will only apply to purchases outside of California and I apologize in advance to friends and family in England and elsewhere for the excessive freight costs. Everything possible has been done to seek cheaper alternatives. All purchases made within the boundaries of the city of Long Beach will be hand delivered for free by yours truly.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I totally get it if you cannot support this project financially but please do not think your contribution must end there! I am eternally grateful for every social media share, every conversation in which you introduce HOLB to someone new and every LIKE or virtual high five of support along the way! So please share this campaign on your social media and tell someone about it at work, the pub, the gym or anywhere else for that matter.</p>
<p>This book does not signify the end of Humans of Long Beach, I'm having too much fun for that. It is merely the beginning so please follow us on Instagram @humansoflong and go to and 'Like' our Facebook page at <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/humansoflb/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.facebook.com/humansoflb/</a></p>
<p>Thank you for reading to the end!  I hope you can come along on this journey, be a part of this intended tribute to the people of a remarkable city and help me to get this celebration out there.</p>
</div><p>And that's all there is to it.</p><p>Thank you all and have a great Christmas,</p><p>Matt</p></div>","Introduction

What I Need & What You Get

Humans of Long Beach, the book will be a strictly limited edition. Once they're gone they're gone, and this is your chance to guarantee ownership of this remarkable tribute to the people of a remarkable city. 
If there is one thing I didn't know that I sure know now when I set out on my journey to create this book it is this.

The Impact

<h3>Why I'm doing this campaign:</h3>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Welcome to my campaign to create a book of portraits to help fund future temple constructions at Burning Man...you may not know it, but BM Org almost always come up short on the construction expenses and have to take money from other projects.  </span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">My minimum goal is to print 1,000 books for distribution to burners and book stores.  My ideal goal is to print 2,000 books.  All profits, less production costs and tax considerations will be donated to Burning Man for future temple construction costs.</span></p>
<p>I'm doing this project in remembrance of my late wife, Ilene Kouzel, who never got to go to Burning Man and all those who have lost loved ones.  You can read more about that in the background section toward the end of the story.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>What your contribution will do:</b></p>
<p>Your contribution to ""Burners"" will enable me to publish the book and donate as much of the profits as the IRS will allow to the construction of the Temple.  The book will reveal our diversity as a creative cross section of global society.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<h3><b>What We Need:   $20,000 to $50,000</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>$20,000 is the minimum needed to print 1,000 books of 100 pages in length.  For every $5,000 raised above $20,000 I can add 16 pages and If we reach $50,000, I can print 2,000  144 page books.  My Burning Man contribution goal through the sale of books is $30,000 or more.</p>
<p><b><b></b></b></p>
<h3><b><b><b><h3>What You Get: Books, Cards, Portraits, &amp; Portfolios  </h3></b></b></b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>I’ve created 16 different contribution levels (one for every year of the Temple from 2000 to 2015) from $15 to $10,000.  I’m  especially excited to offer you an opportunity to receive very unique, custom and personalized products in return for your contribution. </p>
<p>The <span style=""font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 0px;line-height: 30px;"">Temple of Stars </span>offer is a beautiful trade edition hardback book of 144 pages with a dust jacket.  Below is an example of the current draft design for the dust jacket cover of the book using my photograph of the 2007 Temple of Forgiveness burn.    However, I am going to take a survey of you contributors to give you an opportunity to participate in the selection by giving me your thoughts as to the best image for the cover.  </p>

<h3><b>WANT SOMETHING SPECIAL?  CHECK OUT THE</b></h3>
<h3><b>                         TEMPLE OF HOPE: </b></h3>
<h3><b>Uniquely Personalized Collector's Edition  </b></h3>
<p>For Burners I have photographed (or photograph in 2016), the Temple of Hope offer is truly unique.  You will not only receive a signed (to you personally if desired) book, you can receive a book that has a ""chocolate"" image of your choice from our session “tipped in” (printing trade lingo for impressed) on the cover of the cloth covered, hardbound book with slipcase.  </p>
<p><i>If I have not photographed you</i> and you come to the 2016 Burn, I will schedule a session with you and you can pick the image you want from that session to have impressed on the cover of the book.  If an image from 2016 is used, this will delay your receiving the book until November.</p>
<p>Below is an example using the 2007 Temple Burn Photo:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1451856652/k22kr5uns0howzjixykf.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Here is an example of what the book and slipcase would look like with a photograph from a session with me:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1451856688/pi0z7lmxi9ekz2lovch4.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Alternatively, you may choose your own favorite portrait from the book or my color photograph of the 2007 Temple Burn and Temple Guardian tipped in on the cover. </p>
<p>Below are additional examples of what a personalized book could look like:</p>

<p>The <span style=""font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 0px;line-height: 30px;"">Temple of the Mind</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> offer is a set of 12 ""Chocolate"" postcards.  Below are possible images for the set I will create.  There will be at least one image from each of the book's divisions: Adventure, Creativity, Community, Discovery, Play &amp; Joy, Sensuality &amp; Sexuality, and Spirituality. </span></p>
<p><b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1451875134/whx0ppjrm1ktqywkgpus.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></b></p>
<p>Some of these images may not be in the book but, so far at least, this is the pool from which I will select the ones for the postcard set.</p>

    Why I'm doing the campaign

    What we need to create the book

    Descriptions & visuals of what you get (perks) for your contribution

    Other (non-cash) ways to help the campaign

    Background on the project


Why I'm doing this campaign:



Welcome to my campaign to create a book of portraits to help fund future temple constructions at Burning Man...you may not know it, but BM Org almost always come up short on the construction expenses and have to take money from other projects.  
My minimum goal is to print 1,000 books for distribution to burners and book stores.  My ideal goal is to print 2,000 books.  All profits, less production costs and tax considerations will be donated to Burning Man for future temple construction costs.
I'm doing this project in remembrance of my late wife, Ilene Kouzel, who never got to go to Burning Man and all those who have lost loved ones.  You can read more about that in the background section toward the end of the story.  

What your contribution will do:
Your contribution to ""Burners"" will enable me to publish the book and donate as much of the profits as the IRS will allow to the construction of the Temple.  The book will reveal our diversity as a creative cross section of global society.



What We Need:   $20,000 to $50,000

$20,000 is the minimum needed to print 1,000 books of 100 pages in length.  For every $5,000 raised above $20,000 I can add 16 pages and If we reach $50,000, I can print 2,000  144 page books.  My Burning Man contribution goal through the sale of books is $30,000 or more.

What You Get: Books, Cards, Portraits, & Portfolios  

I’ve created 16 different contribution levels (one for every year of the Temple from 2000 to 2015) from $15 to $10,000.  I’m  especially excited to offer you an opportunity to receive very unique, custom and personalized products in return for your contribution. 
The Temple of Stars offer is a beautiful trade edition hardback book of 144 pages with a dust jacket.  Below is an example of the current draft design for the dust jacket cover of the book using my photograph of the 2007 Temple of Forgiveness burn.    However, I am going to take a survey of you contributors to give you an opportunity to participate in the selection by giving me your thoughts as to the best image for the cover.  


WANT SOMETHING SPECIAL?  CHECK OUT THE
                         TEMPLE OF HOPE: 
Uniquely Personalized Collector's Edition  
For Burners I have photographed (or photograph in 2016), the Temple of Hope offer is truly unique.  You will not only receive a signed (to you personally if desired) book, you can receive a book that has a ""chocolate"" image of your choice from our session “tipped in” (printing trade lingo for impressed) on the cover of the cloth covered, hardbound book with slipcase.  
If I have not photographed you and you come to the 2016 Burn, I will schedule a session with you and you can pick the image you want from that session to have impressed on the cover of the book.  If an image from 2016 is used, this will delay your receiving the book until November.
Below is an example using the 2007 Temple Burn Photo:

Here is an example of what the book and slipcase would look like with a photograph from a session with me:

Alternatively, you may choose your own favorite portrait from the book or my color photograph of the 2007 Temple Burn and Temple Guardian tipped in on the cover. 
Below are additional examples of what a personalized book could look like:



Additional Perks
The Temple of the Mind offer is a set of 12 ""Chocolate"" postcards.  Below are possible images for the set I will create.  There will be at least one image from each of the book's divisions: Adventure, Creativity, Community, Discovery, Play & Joy, Sensuality & Sexuality, and Spirituality. 

Some of these images may not be in the book but, so far at least, this is the pool from which I will select the ones for the postcard set.

These and other images from the book--or your portrait session with me--are also available as individual prints as described below.
The Temples of Tears, Joy, & Honor offers are: 
Your Choice of Individual prints (color or chocolate)  in three different sizes (8x10, 11x14, & 13x19) mounted on archival board & suitable for framing.  Example below.


The Temple of Dreams combines a book, postcards and a 9x12 print.



For Collectors wanting something even more special
I am also offering several opportunities for you to have individual fine art prints or a portfolio of images from the book and mounted on archival matt board. 
The Temple of Flux offer is a custom, hand made cloth covered clamshell box holding both the book and ten fine art prints of your choice (Temple Burn in color; Chocolate image from the book, or from your session).  The pocket on the left holds the 9""x12"" or 8""x10"" print.

Another individual offer is the Basura Sagrada Temple portfolio.  This is a set of 10 individual 9X12 prints from the book mounted on 14x18 archival matt board suitable for viewing or framing and contained in a folio similar to the example below (color may vary a bit).   Once you receive your book, you can order the prints you want from the book so they will be unique to your collection.

My final individual offer is the  Fire of Fires Temple  which is a combination of a custom book and a portfolio of five 9x12 mounted prints in a custom portfolio. 

 



Multiples for better prices:

In addition to the individual offers above, there are several multiple sets that can be purchased which will result in additional savings.  So...consider getting a group of burners together to order the baker's dozen or other multiples.  These are:
Temple of Forgiveness:  13 books for the price of 12.



Temple of Transition:  13 books, sets of postcards & prints for the price of 12.



Temple of Juno:  3 custom books & portfolios of 5 prints



Temple of Wholyness:  5 custom books & portfolios of 5 prints



Temple of Grace:  13 custom books & prints
Temple of Promise:  13 custom books & portfolios of 10 prints

<h3> </h3>
<h3>What's it all about?</h3>
<p>I'm a photographer, artist, author, teacher, wildlife biologist, explorer, questioner. I've always loved, read, and collected books. An early career goal was to become an author. I'm curious and like to try new things to expand my experiences and knowledge. </p>
<p>As a wildlife biologist interested in the Big Picture - ecology, the human/nature/culture relationship, physics, climate, open spaces, and the psychology and biology of it all - I'm fascinated by the interrelationships of everything, tied together as John Muir eloquently pointed out. As an artist I'm compelled to interpret the world as I interact with it, from the basis of my own education, experiences, and emotions, and to communicate that as best I can to others. As an instructor, my goal is to inspire others to train their awareness and be open to all opportunities for learning, experiencing, experimenting. The connectivity between science, art, experience, interpretation, and education is obvious to me. The Big Picture is right in front of me every day. But, I also understand not everyone sees the world the same way I do. That's the driving force behind my art; to describe in images and text how I experience the world, to reveal the Big Picture in a beautiful and informed way that might inspire others to explore in their own way.  </p>
<p>Artistically, it's tough to interpret the variety of experiences in a single representative medium. I've spent most of my artistic life experimenting with ways to best show and communicate my experiences in a meaningful way, and will continue to experiment with artistic expression for the rest of my life. </p>
<p>This project is born of my love of books and being creative. In 2016 I self-published my first book, <i>The Ecology of Photography<i>, </i>about the ""why"" of photography</i>. It was a challenging and rewarding experience that was made possible through crowdfunding and I plan to write more books. However, the mechanized, digital process of publishing that book made me feel a little distant from my work. I also make alternative process prints of my photographs, primarily cyanotypes, as a means to get my hands on more aspects of the art I create. So, I decided to pursue bookbinding to create my own limited edition photo books and books of my writings; to return to making stuff by hand instead of typing on a keyboard and shuffling a mouse or digital pen around. The book as a handmade book, and as an art form in and of itself, allows for a more personal expression and interpretation of the world than something made by a machine. </p>
<p>To that end, I plan to attend a week long bookbinding workshop at the San Francisco Center for the Book, opened in 1996 as the first center of its kind on the west coast and now hosts over 400 workshops about bookbinding, letterpress, papermaking, and other book-oriented topics. I've been practicing bookbinding, learning on my own as I have time, but recognize that learning from more skilled sources and getting practical hands-on experience in a dedicated, intensive environment, is invaluable for improving at a more rapid pace. During the workshop I'll learn 4 types of binding methods (I've been practicing with one, coptic binding), including 2 case bound (hard back) bindings, flat-back and rounded back. I have several books I've been learning from that describe other binding methods that will be easier to accomplish following this workshop.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>After the workshop, while I'm in the area, I will visit one of my favorite locations: Point Lobos  State Natural Reserve, south of San Francisco at Carmel-By-The-Sea where the landscape and seascape speaks for itself and where Edward Weston and Ansel Adams photographed some of their iconic works. I'll spend several days photographing and writing. From that visit (and previous visits), I will create for you a limited edition, hand bound book of the photographs I make and writings inspired by Point Lobos and the Big Sur region of central California, snugged comfortably in a slipcase or clamshell box. I will include thoughts on our  treatment of, perception of, and relationships to landscapes, on the critical importance of clean water and its various properties of beauty, life, alteration and destruction, and thoughts on photography, curiosity, creativity, and experiences at Point Lobos and the surrounding area of Monterey and Big Sur. The book and case will be designed, printed, signed and numbered, and hand bound by me in my home studio. The book is titled <strong><i>Point Lobos Dreaming</i></strong>. I'm only making 20 in this very limited edition, so stake your claim early!</p>
<p>Another book perk level is a chapbook of poems, thoughts, short essays I write during my time in California, maybe a sketch or two or a cyanotype or woodcut print, you never know. Yeah, I had to look it up, too. A chapbook is a small paper-covered book or pamphlet containing poetry, essays, stories (mainly children's stories) and other ephemera. Coming into being in Europe in the 16th Century, the name ""chapbook"" didn't get coined until the 19th Century and was named after the men who sold them on the street, called chapmen. An offshoot of the chapbook, often sold for a penny and containing stories of crime, the supernatural, adventure, &amp; romance were called Penny Dreadfuls. The western Dime Novel in the 19th Century in America is also an offshoot of the chapbook. The chapbook is typically saddle stitched or stapled. Yours will be sewn. </p>
<p>A third book option is a blank sketch/notebook, coptic sewn so it will lay flat, with blank heavyweight paper and a kraft cover so you can embellish it however you wish.</p>
<p>I've included some samples of photographs I've made in that amazing place, and a haiku or two, just to wet your appetite. </p>

<p>I've turned part of my garage into a small bookbinding studio, alongside my matting and framing and general makin' stuff workspace.

<h3>Impact of this project</h3>
<p>The follow on effect of this project is me learning new skills, techniques, and methods to express my interpretations of the world in my art. There will be future limited edition handmade, hand bound books that are an entire artistic work, not just photos and words between a front and back cover. I have a couple pages of subjects/subject matter already in line for future book projects.</p>
<p>I've been a photography instructor and workshop leader for 20 years and fully expect to incorporate bookbinding in my classes when my skill reaches that level because I love passing on knowledge to others. I'm also an advisory board member for 2 high school commercial technical education photography programs in Boise and Nampa and active with those classes. I'm an Idaho Commission on the Arts Teaching Artist and conduct artist residencies in Idaho schools. This continuing education not only helps me grow but also the students who I interact with regularly. Your investment goes much further than you imagine. </p>
<p>Artists are (or should be, anyway) always learning, experimenting, exploring, always interpreting what they see and experience, communicating through their art. I'm no different. My wildlife biology/science background, along with the experiences I've had traveling, give me a different perspective on the world. Not unique, but different. My hope is my art inspires, challenges, looks good and provides some enjoyment or maybe even a bit of enlightenment. I don't know if you collect art, simply enjoy viewing it, or like to support art, artists, and art making (which I thank you for, regardless of your preference). I don't know if this book will have any monetary value in the future or if you care if it does or not. But it's my gift to you, if you'll have it.</p>

<h3>411: My need, Your loot</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Your support covers the workshop fee, my travel from Idaho to San Francisco and Carmel-By-The-Sea (I'm driving), the materials to create the chapbook, sketch/notebook, and the book and case for <i>Point Lobos Dreaming</i> (paper, book board, book cloth, end papers). This need totals $3000; $1800 for the workshop and travel, $1200 for the books. Shipping will be added when you stake your claim. Additional funds raised will be used to create stretch goals or add-on perks.</p>
<p>* Everyone receives a unique handmade thank you card. It could be something I sketched, a small cyanotype print, a woodcut print, a 4x6 photo, a bit of writing, or whatever I'm in the mood to create.</p>
<p>* Depending on your support level, you may also receive an 8x10 Point Lobos print, or the chapbook of artwork, writings, poems, &amp; short essays, or the 8x10 handbound, blank, 120+ page, lay-flat (coptic sewn), sketch/notebook with a blank kraft cover for you to embellish for yourself, or the limited edition <i>Point Lobos Dreaming</i> book and case. Remember, I'm only making 20 of <i>Point Lobos Dreaming, </i>which will be 8x10, at least 80 pages, though probably closer to 120, made with heavyweight paper (still testing, but will be at least 50 lb or 229 gsm), likely with a flat-back binding versus coptic sewn.  And I wouldn't be surprised to see one or more handwritten pages in this book.</p>
<p>* Supporters will receive 1 or 2 updates on this project page per week until I leave for the workshop. While I'm at the workshop and Point Lobos, I will make daily updates on my progress and what's going on. When I return, the updates will likely return to 1 -2 per week as I'm getting everything organized and into production mode. I'll post less frequent public updates as well, to keep everyone on the same page, as it were. </p>

<h3>oops! But it's OK</h3>
<p>What happens if the Fates decree I don't reach my goal? I'm committed to attending the workshop, and this project is set up with Flexible Funding, so whatever funding I receive will go to offset costs and/or purchase materials for prints and books. I will honor whatever support I receive. A couple previous projects on another platform were hampered because it was an all-or-nothing set up. Everybody lost. With Flexible Funding, I get something and you get something, even if it's not everything. Everyone who supports this project gets a personal thank you. Support me at any book level and you will receive a handmade book; a chapbook, a sketch/notebook, or the limited edition <i>Point Lobos Dreaming</i>. If you support me at the print level, you'll receive an 8x10 Point Lobos print. If it all goes south, I guess none of us gets anything, which would be a bum deal because I want to create these books and you probably want one, or two.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>What stands in my way? Every time I venture out to do something there are potential blocks and hazards: Weather, mechanical failure, economics, accident, theft, and other unforeseen emergencies. Lack of preparation and equipment/tools to complete the task is also a challenge. Everything is possible; it just takes money, right? That, and commitment, dedication, and persistence. I have the equipment needed to complete the project, and I will have improved skills following the workshop. I'm all set.</p>
<p>For the photography at Point Lobos, the weather is always a primary player in determining the level of challenge. I've photographed in all sorts of conditions at high elevation and north and south latitudes, in rain, snow, cold, heat, wind, insects. Comparatively, the central California coast in summer is a walk in the park. Weather creates mood, interest, drama, story. Clear blue skies are nice now and then, but for a photographer too much nice weather is difficult to handle. However it turns out to be, I will make the most of it.</p>
<p>Handmade books do take a little time to make. With my current experience level, it will take me roughly 20-25 hours to make each <i>Point Lobos Dreaming</i> book once the design work, image editing, and layout is completed, which I will do during the month of September. Making the book includes printing the pages, making the covers, stitching the signatures, finishing the book construction, building the book box (clam shell or slip case, not sure yet), and shipping prep. I estimate I will begin layout and design, along with image editing and processing, in early September. I will have the paper selected and tested by then, and ordered, along with other materials such as book board, book cloth, end papers, etc. for the number of books I'll need to make. The sketch/notebooks take about 1/3 the time, and I can work on those while parts of the Point Lobos book are drying or pressing. Chapbooks are the easiest and I can turn those out fairly quickly once the design work is done. What will take a little time with the chapbooks is if there is any ""manual entry"", like handwritten pages or drawing/sketching or cyanotype printing that needs to be done. </p>

So, I'm not worried about missing this opportunity or failing to perform.</p>

</div><p>Thank you for your support</p></div>","What's it all about?
I'm a photographer, artist, author, teacher, wildlife biologist, explorer, questioner. I've always loved, read, and collected books. An early career goal was to become an author. I'm curious and like to try new things to expand my experiences and knowledge. 
As a wildlife biologist interested in the Big Picture - ecology, the human/nature/culture relationship, physics, climate, open spaces, and the psychology and biology of it all - I'm fascinated by the interrelationships of everything, tied together as John Muir eloquently pointed out. As an artist I'm compelled to interpret the world as I interact with it, from the basis of my own education, experiences, and emotions, and to communicate that as best I can to others. As an instructor, my goal is to inspire others to train their awareness and be open to all opportunities for learning, experiencing, experimenting. The connectivity between science, art, experience, interpretation, and education is obvious to me. The Big Picture is right in front of me every day. But, I also understand not everyone sees the world the same way I do. That's the driving force behind my art; to describe in images and text how I experience the world, to reveal the Big Picture in a beautiful and informed way that might inspire others to explore in their own way.  
Artistically, it's tough to interpret the variety of experiences in a single representative medium. I've spent most of my artistic life experimenting with ways to best show and communicate my experiences in a meaningful way, and will continue to experiment with artistic expression for the rest of my life. 
This project is born of my love of books and being creative. In 2016 I self-published my first book, The Ecology of Photography, about the ""why"" of photography. It was a challenging and rewarding experience that was made possible through crowdfunding and I plan to write more books. However, the mechanized, digital process of publishing that book made me feel a little distant from my work. I also make alternative process prints of my photographs, primarily cyanotypes, as a means to get my hands on more aspects of the art I create. So, I decided to pursue bookbinding to create my own limited edition photo books and books of my writings; to return to making stuff by hand instead of typing on a keyboard and shuffling a mouse or digital pen around. The book as a handmade book, and as an art form in and of itself, allows for a more personal expression and interpretation of the world than something made by a machine. 
To that end, I plan to attend a week long bookbinding workshop at the San Francisco Center for the Book, opened in 1996 as the first center of its kind on the west coast and now hosts over 400 workshops about bookbinding, letterpress, papermaking, and other book-oriented topics. I've been practicing bookbinding, learning on my own as I have time, but recognize that learning from more skilled sources and getting practical hands-on experience in a dedicated, intensive environment, is invaluable for improving at a more rapid pace. During the workshop I'll learn 4 types of binding methods (I've been practicing with one, coptic binding), including 2 case bound (hard back) bindings, flat-back and rounded back. I have several books I've been learning from that describe other binding methods that will be easier to accomplish following this workshop.
 

San Francisco Center for the Book

 
After the workshop, while I'm in the area, I will visit one of my favorite locations: Point Lobos  State Natural Reserve, south of San Francisco at Carmel-By-The-Sea where the landscape and seascape speaks for itself and where Edward Weston and Ansel Adams photographed some of their iconic works. I'll spend several days photographing and writing. From that visit (and previous visits), I will create for you a limited edition, hand bound book of the photographs I make and writings inspired by Point Lobos and the Big Sur region of central California, snugged comfortably in a slipcase or clamshell box. I will include thoughts on our  treatment of, perception of, and relationships to landscapes, on the critical importance of clean water and its various properties of beauty, life, alteration and destruction, and thoughts on photography, curiosity, creativity, and experiences at Point Lobos and the surrounding area of Monterey and Big Sur. The book and case will be designed, printed, signed and numbered, and hand bound by me in my home studio. The book is titled Point Lobos Dreaming. I'm only making 20 in this very limited edition, so stake your claim early!
Another book perk level is a chapbook of poems, thoughts, short essays I write during my time in California, maybe a sketch or two or a cyanotype or woodcut print, you never know. Yeah, I had to look it up, too. A chapbook is a small paper-covered book or pamphlet containing poetry, essays, stories (mainly children's stories) and other ephemera. Coming into being in Europe in the 16th Century, the name ""chapbook"" didn't get coined until the 19th Century and was named after the men who sold them on the street, called chapmen. An offshoot of the chapbook, often sold for a penny and containing stories of crime, the supernatural, adventure, & romance were called Penny Dreadfuls. The western Dime Novel in the 19th Century in America is also an offshoot of the chapbook. The chapbook is typically saddle stitched or stapled. Yours will be sewn. 
A third book option is a blank sketch/notebook, coptic sewn so it will lay flat, with blank heavyweight paper and a kraft cover so you can embellish it however you wish.
I've included some samples of photographs I've made in that amazing place, and a haiku or two, just to wet your appetite.

<br/><p>Greetings! My name is Shaquille Quamae Hall. I am 18 years old, a high-school senior and getting ready to move on to college. I will be the first in my family to go on to a four year university! I need help getting a new camera and computer before I go.</p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Growing up I never had much and I never asked for much, although when I absolutely knew something would benefit me I chased after it- that's why I chased after Photography. This medium of story telling has saved me from my unpromising future in the streets of Detroit and has taken me to places I would have never imagined. This project not only will improve my proficiency in my art, but will also help in my spot in a lucrative and promising future.</span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Your donation will help me explore other ranges of photography, build a trustworthy base of equipment, create cleaner photographs/stories and finally offset some of the costs of college.</span></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need </h3>

</div></div>","Greetings! My name is Shaquille Quamae Hall. I am 18 years old, a high-school senior and getting ready to move on to college. I will be the first in my family to go on to a four year university! I need help getting a new camera and computer before I go.
Growing up I never had much and I never asked for much, although when I absolutely knew something would benefit me I chased after it- that's why I chased after Photography. This medium of story telling has saved me from my unpromising future in the streets of Detroit and has taken me to places I would have never imagined. This project not only will improve my proficiency in my art, but will also help in my spot in a lucrative and promising future.
Your donation will help me explore other ranges of photography, build a trustworthy base of equipment, create cleaner photographs/stories and finally offset some of the costs of college.   What We Need

<p>Relations between Russia and the US have been changing dramatically in XX-XXI centuries. They were allies, and they were in the process of global geopolitical confrontation; there were thaws and assistance as well as mutual accusations and sanctions. We know almost everything about stars, politicians and politics, the White House and the Kremlin and other stuff from the TV and the Internet, but what do we know about ourselves - who are we beyond the headlines?</p>

<p>People say that America is a country of immigrants. Russian immigrants are common in the US. A lot of Russians fled their “motherland” for different reasons: economic and political problems, personal issues, or they were just chasing the “American dream”…</p>

<p>Russia has been my home for 30 years and I’ve documented life in this country for a decade as a photojournalist. I've just immigrated to the US to start a new life. I've only been to the US once in 2015, and 3 weeks were enough to fall in live with the country, but not enough to understand it. To understand the USA and it’s people better and to find a new place to live, I plan to ride around the states on a bicycle, trying to answer some questions: What does the real America – beyond the headlines – look like? What is a Russian immigrant going to face in this new environment? How is my life going to change? While looking for answers to these questions, I will try to see the USA with an immigrant’s eyes and photograph what I see.</p>

<p>In the end of the journey, I will compare life of ordinary people in Russia and the USA through documentary photography. About 700 photographs from my decade of work in Russia have been already chosen, and that would be the first part of this project. During my journey around the US, I will also collect visual documents of people’s lives and build the second part of the archive. These two archives will help me bring up the picture and explore the questions – are Russians and Americans that different? Or do we have more similarities than we think? DIFFELARITIES is the project that will try to help find the answers.</p>

<h2>The Route</h2>
<p>The “American part” of the project will start in Summer 2017. As I’ve already tried different types of vehicles in previous expeditions, this time I chose to travel around the country on a bicycle. Why? It’s the ideal method of transport for unhurried observation: its speed allows to see more details, to listen and to think more. A bike can go almost anywhere, unlike a car. A bike is cost effective. And it’s eco-friendly. A bicycle will help me meet more people and understand what the real USA looks like.</p>

<p><i>A route computed by Dr. Randal S. Olson (A Senior Data Scientist at the University of Pennsylvania).</i></p>
<p>The starting point of DIFFELARITIES is Washington, DC. The main goal of the trip is to visit as many states as possible to understand the country better. Luckily, I have found an “optimal route” through the US. This route was computed by Dr. Randal S. Olson (A Senior Data Scientist at the University of Pennsylvania). His work will help me visit almost 48 states, lots of towns, cities, and even tourist locations.</p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>The main goal of DIFFELARITIES is to compare life in two countries - Russia and the USA - through documentary photography. To reach it, I have to cycle through 48 states, visit cities and towns and gather as much visual material as possible. The result of the expedition will be published on diffelarities.com, and after the final selections are made, I will start working on digital photobook, copies of which would be sent to my backers. I will also try work on getting an real-life exhibition and publishing a printed photobook. Stay tuned!</p>

<h2>Funding</h2>
<p>As long as the main expedition's vehicle will be a bicycle, and a tent will be my home, I will need not much money to make this expedition happen. Mostly, the money will be spent on basic things: food and bike maintenance.</p>
<p>I already have a great bicycle (thanks to my friends from Finland - <a href=""http://pelagobicycles.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Pelago Bicycles</a>), a tent and all the other equipment for autonomous existence and photographing, as well as experience to live on the road and in the wild. The only thing needed is keeping the body running, so I can keep pedalling and photographing. The minimum is to raise money for the first 12 months of the journey. The plan is to spend not more than $20 per day for food, water and everyday needs. So, the minimum for a year of travelling is $20 x 30 days x 12 months = $7200. This will cover my basic expenses for food for 12 months. If you help me raise more money, I will also be able to stay online (pay for 4G internet) as well as cover some other expenses (like necessary bike parts - cables, brakepads, tires, chains, etc), as well as travel longer.</p>

</div><div>
<p>Of course, there will be unexpected expenses and in that case I will pick jobs in local cafes and bars, if lucky. This would not only be a rest from pedalling, but also would give me a chance to better understand everyday life, customs and habits of different communities of the US.</p>
<p>If this campaign doesn't raise it's goal, the expedition will be still a go. I will just have to change the plans and dates, and pick more jobs on the way.</p>

<h2>About Perks</h2>

<h2>Risks and Challenges</h2>
<p>Previous expeditions were successful (you can learn about some of them <a href=""http://diffelarities.com/#ABOUT_THE_AUTHOR"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>), although most of them were made in a team. But solo expeditions like this is always a bigger risk. Especially, taking in mind that the US is a new country for me, and the main vehicle is a bicycle, and the route isn't really short. Everything can happen on the road. But I believe, despite the challenges I'm going to face, no matter what, the project is going to be finished.</p>
<p>Although, there's a plan and a route, they can change due to circumstances: weather, my physical and mental condition, new encounters, seeking places to stay. There are no strict instructions to stick to, but there's always some room and a need for improvisation.</p>

<p>We are a group of <b>17</b> BA Photography students at Edinburgh College. In June we will be travelling down to London to exhibit our work at Free Range (at The Old Truman Brewery), an annual event featuring the work of graduates from across the country. Free Range is one of the biggest graduate exhibitions in Europe and by exhibiting there we can expect to have our work seen by many more people than a traditional degree show or independent exhibition. This is an opportunity to connect with other students and industry professionals and shape our future careers. <br/></p>
<p>We have been working hard all year to produce our best work so far and we would love to be able to take it to London, however, it is a very expensive trip for us - that's why we need your help!</p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>We need to raise over<b> £5000</b> to get to Free Range. Unfortunately we did not get any money from our College this year and we need to raise it all by ourselves. We ha<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">ve already successfully raised £3000, so we are looking to get another £2000 via  this campaign. </span></p>
<p>We are paying for our accommodation and travel down to London but need your help with the cost of the venue hire and our prints. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>Please feel free to have a look at our work on our website and follow us on our other social media channels. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire unique work by an ambitious group of up and coming photographers. We hope you will enjoy our work and the special perks we will offer for your support. You can also help us out a lot by sharing our campaign on social networks. <br/><br/>Links to all of our work can be found in the gallery section!</p>

<div>Thank You!</div> </div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
</div></div>","We are a group of 17 BA Photography students at Edinburgh College. In June we will be travelling down to London to exhibit our work at Free Range (at The Old Truman Brewery), an annual event featuring the work of graduates from across the country. Free Range is one of the biggest graduate exhibitions in Europe and by exhibiting there we can expect to have our work seen by many more people than a traditional degree show or independent exhibition. This is an opportunity to connect with other students and industry professionals and shape our future careers. 
We have been working hard all year to produce our best work so far and we would love to be able to take it to London, however, it is a very expensive trip for us - that's why we need your help!
   What We Need & What You Get We need to raise over £5000 to get to Free Range. Unfortunately we did not get any money from our College this year and we need to raise it all by ourselves. We have already successfully raised £3000, so we are looking to get another £2000 via  this campaign. 
We are paying for our accommodation and travel down to London but need your help with the cost of the venue hire and our prints. 


Please feel free to have a look at our work on our website and follow us on our other social media channels. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire unique work by an ambitious group of up and coming photographers. We hope you will enjoy our work and the special perks we will offer for your support. You can also help us out a lot by sharing our campaign on social networks. Links to all of our work can be found in the gallery section!
Our exhibition dates are: Thursday 18th - Monday 22nd of June 2015

Opening Night: Thursday 18th June 2015

<p><span>As a writer, I've learned it is more potent to show a character's world, instead of telling the reader about it. How better to do succeed in this effort, than from behind a lens?

<p><span>During a four year quest throughout the Ohio Valley's junkyards, 
alleyways and backyards, I sought to capture the beauty of 
vintage Detroit steel in photographs, preserve their stories that have evolved only through decades weathered patina, the labors of restoration. But, I wanted to create something more than a book of photography on classic cars and trucks. I chose to approach this effort with the perception that art is in the curve of metal, that it evolves in rust blooming under the elements, in the character of craft work we will never see the likes of again. These treasures are, unfortunately, disappearing forever. Theirs and our history alike, vanishes under a veil of overgrowth, or flattened in salvage crushers. <br/></span></p>
<p><span>
Although I cannot rescue or restore every vehicle lost to the scrapyards, I can preserve their stories, the hidden art of patina, chrome and curve, the gleam of restoration cruisin' the highway with the swagger of Saturday night.

</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Feel free to explain more about your campaign and let people know how the difference their contribution will make:</p>
<p>*The art of automotive manufacturing saw it's heyday after WWII. A surplus of steel and chrome was quickly put to use, creating automotive designs, the likes of which will never be seen again. This is our history, our art that once rolled across highways, cruised Saturdays nights and endless summers. Once it's lost to the scrapyard, it's gone forever. Rodz N' Rust is a dedication to this history, the lost art of steel curved into chrome, the stories etched in weathered patina, the labor of restoration, one backyard at a time.</p>

<p>*It's been said that we should do what we feel passionate about, that passion sustains commitment. I absolutely agree with this philosophy. In fact, I would take it to the next level by saying that a commitment to passion is a way of life. Do what you love. Live the way you love. Otherwise, life is just a job. <br/></p>
<p>I find that what I love is the art that is all around us, hidden in the ordinary, waiting for us to see in a different perspective. Once I found a way to see differently, life profoundly changed. Rust was no longer metal in decay. It was art creating itself, blooming in sun. I hope to share some of that wonderment, so that other people might see past the ordinary, the nine-to-five, magic in the mundane.<br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> </p>

</h3><p>The War Zone Freelance Exhibition gives an exclusive look into the work and world of <b>freelance journalists</b> covering wars and conflicts in the Middle East.</p><p>Your
 donation to the War Zone Freelance Exhibition supports the exposure of 
freelance journalists dedicated to covering conflicts worldwide and 
contributes to <b>educating</b> the global public on where much of 
today's news comes from and the stories behind the freelancers in the 
field risking their lives reporting it.</p><div>

The project is motivated
by the desire to pay tribute and provoke debate on the important and consequential
 role freelance journalists play in bringing news out of conflict areas 
to the international public, often with little support, on their own expense and at extremely<b> high risk</b>.<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>The War Zone Freelance Exhibition 2016 is scheduled to begin in London atthe <a href=""http://www.frontlinefreelance.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Frontline Club</a>
 on January 28th and from this legendary venue, the team has planned a 
six month tour to gallery locations in major European cities including 
Paris, Berlin, Amsterdam, Copenhagen, and Barcelona. </p>
<p>The War Zone Freelance Exhibition was founded in July 2015 and has since been published in various <a href=""http://www.warzonefreelance.com/inthemedia"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">media</a> and received great feedback from the <a href=""https://cpj.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Committee to Protect Journalists</a>, <a href=""http://www.frontlinefreelance.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Frontline Freelance Register</a>,
 and other major journalist organizations from around the world. All of 
them are on board to share the WZF message and give informational and 
network support, however none have committed financially. </p>
<p>Since the beginning, the War Zone Freelance Team has been self-financing their project and cannot continue without <b>outside </b><b>support</b>.  <br/></p>

 all spent considerable amounts of time in the last several years 
covering conflicts and humanitarian issues in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, 
Israel, Palestine, among others. With both published and unseen material
 from war zones throughout the Middle East they propose a multi-faceted 
exhibition that will pull its audience deep into the reporting process 
and educate on both people affected by war in the region and the
struggles and triumphs of working independently as a freelancer in a 
high-stakes vocation.</p>

<h3>INSIDE THE EXHIBITION

	
		
		
	
	
		
</h3>
<p>
</p>
<div>
<div>
<p>When one enters the WZF exhibition, the visitor will 
immediately be overtaken by the ambiance created by the multi platform 
gallery presentation. The <b>photography </b>and <b>videography</b> 
gallery is where the audience can take the journey alongside the 
journalists by viewing images from remote battlefields throughout the 
Middle East while looking over <b>personal items</b> in display-cases 
used by the freelancers in the field that made reporting these stories 
possible. Items that each journalist find significant in their reporting
 along with other pieces of their stories that were obtained while 
reporting, including battle flags, uniforms, and other conflict-related 
artifacts. The viewers' mood is heightened by audio of war zone radio 
reporting that will play throughout the photo and video gallery. </p>
<p>Connecting the photography and videography gallery to the interactive memorial will be a section dedicated to <b>local freelancers</b>
 who risk all in helping international media workers produce stories for
 global media outlets. With the use of their own media work and filmed 
interviews these talented individuals will share their personal stories 
of reporting on frontlines in their own countries and the life 
threatening hassles of freelancing as a local journalist. </p>
<p>The final section of the exhibition will be a place to embrace the 
information obtained throughout the exhibit and witness the heavy costs 
of freelancing in war zones, by viewing WZF's <b>memorial wall </b>dedicated to freelance journalists killed or missing while covering conflicts in the Middle East during the last several years. The
 memorial will specifically highlight the local freelance 
photojournalist Molhem Barakat who was killed in Syria while covering 
battles in Aleppo. The memorial will be interactive with a message book 
for visitors that will be sent to the family of the fallen journalist, 
along with items for sale that raise awareness to the costs of reporting
 inside war zones.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1447150868/qmbhdw2kikt9gp3pwhtg.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>FREELANCERS IN DANGER </h3>During the past several years, threats towards journalists, especially 
those working in conflict areas in the Middle East, has increased 
drastically. Sixty-one journalists have been killed for reasons related 
to their work or have died while on assignment so far in 2015.<br/>This year is expected to be the <a href=""http://www.freemedia.at/newssview/article/2015-threatens-to-end-as-deadliest-year-on-record.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">deadliest year </a>ever
 for journalists. Freelancers with limited means, little backing from 
media companies, and often working alone in the field are further 
exposed to danger and account to the high number of deaths.<br/><h3>

<div>Syrian freelance photographer in his late teens Molhem Barakat was killed on December 20th 2013 while covering a battle at al-Kindi Hospital in Aleppo, Syria. Since May that year, he had been freelancing for Reuters who distributed dozens of his pictures around the world, some of them appearing in prestigious publications such as The New Yorker and The New York Times. <br/><div>
<p><br/>Selected photos from Molhem's portfolio will be displayed in the WZF interactive memorial along with the cameras he carried the day he was killed. <br/><br/>“Journalism was his whole life, it was his message to present real and honest photos. I ask you that you display his cameras in the exhibition so that the whole world can see it. My son’s blood is on those cameras”, Molhem’s mother writes to WZF about her son’s story being told at the War Zone Freelance Exhibition.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>EDUCATIONAL PERSPECTIVE
					
				</h3>
<p>Many exhibitions fail to tell the story behind the story of what it is 
like for journalists working in
dangerous places. The WZF Exhibition will serve as a tool to educate on 
the profession of freelance journalism. The mobile exhibit is an ideal place for <b>journalism students</b> and media 
majors to learn about the freelance profession, a field that is often 
left out of college and university journalism curriculum.  
</p>
<p>In each city we exhibit in, our goal is to highlight a local 
freelance journalist that has covered conflicts in the Mideast by 
sharing his/ her work and their experiences. The WZF journalists 
themselves will give <b>lectures</b> and hold <b>Q&amp;As</b>
to talk about their experiences and the impact of current conflicts in the Middle East.

</p>
<p>In addition to highlighting local international journalist the 
freelancers and fixers from Iraq, Syria, and the Kurdistan region, who's
 work is displayed in the exhibition will come to elaborate in an open 
discussion forum on the challenges of covering war and conflicts as a 
freelance journalist in their home country.  
</p>
<p>Speakers from international journalism organizations will attend for 
lectures to give statistical information and share their insight on the 
current state of freelance journalism.

<p></p>
</div>
</div>
<h3>FUTURE GOALS
</h3>
<p>
</p>
<div>
<div>
<p>After touring the Middle East exhibition for a six
month period to major cities in Europe the WZF team hopes to purpose a second six month
tour through <b>North America</b> starting in New York City and ending in Toronto
where the exhibition media will be sold to raise money for CJFE's
Journalists in Distress Fund. </p>
<p>Afterwards, the vision of the WZF team is to expand beyond the Middle East in
order to cover more of the many conflicts happening today around the world,
including <b>Africa</b>, <b>East Asia</b> and <b>Eastern Europe</b>. </p>
<p>The idea is to support and empower deep and
authentic reporting by exhibiting local and international freelancers covering
those areas. Through our exhibitions and online media strategies, we create a
platform for both established freelancers and <b>lesser-known talents</b> to display
their work and experiences to the public through the exhibition, our social media, and
photo &amp; video competitions.</p>

</div><br/></div>","THE EXHIBITION EXPERIENCE
The War Zone Freelance Exhibition gives an exclusive look into the work and world of freelance journalists covering wars and conflicts in the Middle East.Your
 donation to the War Zone Freelance Exhibition supports the exposure of 
freelance journalists dedicated to covering conflicts worldwide and 
contributes to educating the global public on where much of 
today's news comes from and the stories behind the freelancers in the 
field risking their lives reporting it.

The project is motivated
by the desire to pay tribute and provoke debate on the important and consequential
 role freelance journalists play in bringing news out of conflict areas 
to the international public, often with little support, on their own expense and at extremely high risk.


The War Zone Freelance Exhibition 2016 is scheduled to begin in London atthe Frontline Club
 on January 28th and from this legendary venue, the team has planned a 
six month tour to gallery locations in major European cities including 
Paris, Berlin, Amsterdam, Copenhagen, and Barcelona. 
The War Zone Freelance Exhibition was founded in July 2015 and has since been published in various media and received great feedback from the Committee to Protect Journalists, Frontline Freelance Register,
 and other major journalist organizations from around the world. All of 
them are on board to share the WZF message and give informational and 
network support, however none have committed financially. 
Since the beginning, the War Zone Freelance Team has been self-financing their project and cannot continue without outside support.  

CREATORS
The War Zone Freelance Exhibition is made up by a team of international freelance journalists. 
American photojournalist Osie Greenway, Danish writer/ reporter Anne Alling, German writer/ photographer Benjamin Hiller,and Dutch videographer/
photographer Jeffry Ruigendijk have
 all spent considerable amounts of time in the last several years 
covering conflicts and humanitarian issues in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, 
Israel, Palestine, among others. With both published and unseen material
 from war zones throughout the Middle East they propose a multi-faceted 
exhibition that will pull its audience deep into the reporting process 
and educate on both people affected by war in the region and the
struggles and triumphs of working independently as a freelancer in a 
high-stakes vocation.




INSIDE THE EXHIBITION

	
		
		
	
	
		





When one enters the WZF exhibition, the visitor will 
immediately be overtaken by the ambiance created by the multi platform 
gallery presentation. The photography and videography 
gallery is where the audience can take the journey alongside the 
journalists by viewing images from remote battlefields throughout the 
Middle East while looking over personal items in display-cases 
used by the freelancers in the field that made reporting these stories 
possible. Items that each journalist find significant in their reporting
 along with other pieces of their stories that were obtained while 
reporting, including battle flags, uniforms, and other conflict-related 
artifacts. The viewers' mood is heightened by audio of war zone radio 
reporting that will play throughout the photo and video gallery. 
Connecting the photography and videography gallery to the interactive memorial will be a section dedicated to local freelancers
 who risk all in helping international media workers produce stories for
 global media outlets. With the use of their own media work and filmed 
interviews these talented individuals will share their personal stories 
of reporting on frontlines in their own countries and the life 
threatening hassles of freelancing as a local journalist. 
The final section of the exhibition will be a place to embrace the 
information obtained throughout the exhibit and witness the heavy costs 
of freelancing in war zones, by viewing WZF's memorial wall dedicated to freelance journalists killed or missing while covering conflicts in the Middle East during the last several years. The
 memorial will specifically highlight the local freelance 
photojournalist Molhem Barakat who was killed in Syria while covering 
battles in Aleppo. The memorial will be interactive with a message book 
for visitors that will be sent to the family of the fallen journalist, 
along with items for sale that raise awareness to the costs of reporting
 inside war zones.

FREELANCERS IN DANGER During the past several years, threats towards journalists, especially 
those working in conflict areas in the Middle East, has increased 
drastically. Sixty-one journalists have been killed for reasons related 
to their work or have died while on assignment so far in 2015.This year is expected to be the deadliest year ever
 for journalists. Freelancers with limited means, little backing from 
media companies, and often working alone in the field are further 
exposed to danger and account to the high number of deaths.












Syrian freelance photographer in his late teens Molhem Barakat was killed on December 20th 2013 while covering a battle at al-Kindi Hospital in Aleppo, Syria. Since May that year, he had been freelancing for Reuters who distributed dozens of his pictures around the world, some of them appearing in prestigious publications such as The New Yorker and The New York Times. 
Selected photos from Molhem's portfolio will be displayed in the WZF interactive memorial along with the cameras he carried the day he was killed. “Journalism was his whole life, it was his message to present real and honest photos. I ask you that you display his cameras in the exhibition so that the whole world can see it. My son’s blood is on those cameras”, Molhem’s mother writes to WZF about her son’s story being told at the War Zone Freelance Exhibition.


EDUCATIONAL PERSPECTIVE
					
				
Many exhibitions fail to tell the story behind the story of what it is 
like for journalists working in
dangerous places. The WZF Exhibition will serve as a tool to educate on 
the profession of freelance journalism. The mobile exhibit is an ideal place for journalism students and media 
majors to learn about the freelance profession, a field that is often 
left out of college and university journalism curriculum.  

In each city we exhibit in, our goal is to highlight a local 
freelance journalist that has covered conflicts in the Mideast by 
sharing his/ her work and their experiences. The WZF journalists 
themselves will give lectures and hold Q&As
to talk about their experiences and the impact of current conflicts in the Middle East.


In addition to highlighting local international journalist the 
freelancers and fixers from Iraq, Syria, and the Kurdistan region, who's
 work is displayed in the exhibition will come to elaborate in an open 
discussion forum on the challenges of covering war and conflicts as a 
freelance journalist in their home country.  

Speakers from international journalism organizations will attend for 
lectures to give statistical information and share their insight on the 
current state of freelance journalism.





FUTURE GOALS





After touring the Middle East exhibition for a six
month period to major cities in Europe the WZF team hopes to purpose a second six month
tour through North America starting in New York City and ending in Toronto
where the exhibition media will be sold to raise money for CJFE's
Journalists in Distress Fund. 
Afterwards, the vision of the WZF team is to expand beyond the Middle East in
order to cover more of the many conflicts happening today around the world,
including Africa, East Asia and Eastern Europe. 
The idea is to support and empower deep and
authentic reporting by exhibiting local and international freelancers covering
those areas. Through our exhibitions and online media strategies, we create a
platform for both established freelancers and lesser-known talents to display
their work and experiences to the public through the exhibition, our social media, and
photo & video competitions.

political and economic polarisation that will most likely split the Nation.</span><br/></p>
<p>For many Americans it is a choice between bad

West Coast using his camera to visualise the eve of a new and potentially even

<p>Every voyage has its own unpredictable
dynamics. Zownir’s focus is, as always, based on his very own sympathy for the
underdogs of this world. Known for his radical reports, he will once again
illuminate the depths of everyday social life in America. In snapshots,
photographic essays and environmental studies of outsiders and social
underclasses, Miron Zownir is carrying on the tradition of his social

<p>Not only the <b>skid rows of San Francisco and LA

be the topics of Zownirs photographic research. The photographer’s focus is
also on <b>the desolate situation of the ""Native Americans"" in the cities
of the West and the life on the reservations.</b></p>
<p>In San Francisco, back then in his twenties,
Zownir captured the gloomy and melancholy portrait of a proud and stoic Native
American, wearing a crown of feathers, his eyes hidden in melancholic darkness
and a mouth resembling a line of disappointment. </p>
<p>Thirty-six years later, the living conditions
of the Native American have not improved at all. The racial discrimination is
still ongoing. Especially in San Francisco this discrimination is very subtly,
yet painfully obvious by social exclusion and an apparently invisible trauma of
violence and racism inherited by generations. What becomes apparent are the
fatal and inevitable consequences in an inhumane vicious cycle: drugs and
alcohol abuse, homelessness. National data state that the San Francisco Bay
Area has the highest percentage of Native Americans living with AIDS and HIV
compared to any other region in the United States.</p>
<p>Twenty years ago Zownir left the USA where he
had lived and photographed for almost 15 years. After many photo excursions
through Russia, Germany, Poland, Bulgaria, France, Romania and the Ukraine, he
is now once again drawn back to the United States.</p>
<p><b>Many say the America he knew no longer exists. </b></p>
<p>In his recently published photobook NYC RIP,
showing exclusively photos from the 80’s, Lydia Lunch wrote in her
introduction: “ The world contain within these pages speaks volumes to a time

zenith of its mania.” </p>
<p>60 years after Robert Frank's ground-breaking
legacy ""The Americans"" it is Zownir’s intention - with unbroken
courage, creative flexibility, analogue and minimalistic means and the
disquieting beauty of his visual language - to dive under America’s surface.  His portraits have always been encounters of
a special kind, his city landscapes are magical and timeless; they challenge
the viewer to take a closer look at society’s rejects and create an awareness
of the contradictions, prejudices, exploitations and misunderstandings of our
times.</p>
