<p>Lead by Nightevil, the Sisterhood of Lilith is one of the most powerful infernal cults in Chicago. Their main goal: to ready the world for the return of their goddess, who will then enslave those who worship her and eradicate the rest. The children of their breeders, (Neo Nephilim or Neo-Nephs) infest the city, but are kept in check by Victor Locke, Decoy and other Chicago based hunters.</p>

<p>The children of SOL breeders, (Neo Nephilim or Neo-Nephs) are infesting the city, but one child, a magic adapt named Damious is found to completely human, thus now, as a man, he will be forced to marry. While able to choose from many brides, he knows where such union will lead. Like former member Hanover Blake, he seeks to escape, but knows there's no hope.     </p>

It didn't take long for McCarthy to abandon his tastes in southern rock and heavy metal for the punk and pop sounds of his own generation.  McCarthy, a fledgling cartoonist, turned Cole onto the alternative comics scene of the early '80's, especially the work being published by Fantagraphics Books. If they could create a story that Fantagraphics would publish that encompassed their unique take on ""punk"", as the Hernandez Bros. had done with Love &amp; Rockets, yet infused with the culture clash of southern characters, they would have a winner. That idea became KID ANARCHY. </p><p>KID ANARCHY was published by Fantagraphics Book for 3 issues from 1990-1993.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1490381141/cmjbabm2dwzytntlgr8o.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Flash-forward 23 years: KID ANARCHY is now a screenplay loosely based on the 90's comic book about an ‘80’s culture.

He's a troubled 15 year old punk rocker adrift in the year 1984. Tommy is upset with his mother for her drinking and abandonment then he's forced to go live with his relatives in Mississippi. He has no rights, no father, and no plans for a future other than forming a band and playing the Antenna Club in Memphis. However, Tommy is too young to ever be allowed into this counter-culture dive bar.When Tommy arrives in Mississippi and is forced to make new friends, he is quick to judge. He finds solace in playing bar chords on his beat up guitar (his hero is Johnny Ramone). Tommy has no inspiration to write his own song until he meets Nina, his English teacher who assigns a book report on Orwell's ""1984"". Slowly he discovers that rebellion comes in many different shapes and sizes and somewhere there is a balance between rule and ruin. When these new friends speak to Tommy's heart, he must re-evaluate the life he is living and the direction he is headed. KID ANARCHY is a character and a comic books series that was originally created in 1982 by Mike McCarthy (artist) and George Cole (writer). Cole and McCarthy met in Design class at Northeast Mississippi Junior College.Born in the last years of the baby boom, the teenage boys immediate connection was music, albeit on different sides of the cultural landscape: Cole gave McCarthy homemade mix tapes featuring English and American punk bands that McCarthy had never heard of. In this, there was an ulterior motive. Cole needed a guitar player for his punk rock band and was hoping to make a convert out of McCarthy. It didn't take long for McCarthy to abandon his tastes in southern rock and heavy metal for the punk and pop sounds of his own generation.  McCarthy, a fledgling cartoonist, turned Cole onto the alternative comics scene of the early '80's, especially the work being published by Fantagraphics Books. If they could create a story that Fantagraphics would publish that encompassed their unique take on ""punk"", as the Hernandez Bros. had done with Love & Rockets, yet infused with the culture clash of southern characters, they would have a winner. That idea became KID ANARCHY. KID ANARCHY was published by Fantagraphics Book for 3 issues from 1990-1993.Flash-forward 23 years: KID ANARCHY is now a screenplay loosely based on the 90's comic book about an ‘80’s culture. The screenplay was written from 2012 through 2016 by George Cole, Mike McCarthy, with friend and co-writer Bart Shannon. The proposed 100 page graphic novel will be based on the KID ANARCHY screenplay. If the graphic novel ultimately helps get the movie version made, all the better, but McCarthy wants the story to LIVE (regardless of format). It just so happens McCarthy can illustrate the entire screenplay (with your support!)Cartooning was McCarthy's original passion before he started making films. Now he’s looking forward to returning to comics with a cast of characters that he and George Cole started out with so long ago. The new graphic novel will again be published by Fantagraphics Books around 2019.Since KID ANARCHY was a three issue series that came out back in the early '90's, Fantagraphics publisher Gary Groth suggested using a different title now to avoid confusion with the earlier books. Therefore the new graphic novel will be called THE ANGRY REDNECKS: (A KID ANARCHY ADVENTURE).In the story, Tommy forms a punk rock band composed of himself on guitar and lead vocal with his best friends Sam Boone on drums and Sherman Krellberg on bass. Sam and Sherman have no previous experience playing in a punk band but according Tommy, that's a PLUS. Tommy must revert the 'brain damage' inflicted upon Sam by the sounds of Ted Nugent, Molly Hatchet, and other hard rockers for whom Tommy shows a stomach-churning disdain. Will punk win out over the corporate interests of the day?  Will friendships be tested along the way?The Angry Rednecks band made no appearances in the '90's version of Kid Anarchy comic books. However, there was a real (albeit short-lived) Angry Rednecks band composed of George Cole, John Prescott, and Mike McCarthy (pictured below) circa 1983. Supporting character Sherman Krellberg's eventual backstory was based somewhat on John Prescott.The real ""Angry Rednecks"" practiced in an old Mississippi shed which was quite a distance from McCarthy's house and required many long orange extension cords to power the noisy chaos where 60 years earlier, McCarthy's grandfather had parked his Model T Ford. The Angry Rednecks had several after-school practices performing short bursts of energy like ""Mississippi"" and ""Skoal Patrol"" before they were unceremoniously unplugged one day by an unemployed, gap-toothed Chuck Moonchow. This was literally and symbolically the end of the real Angry Rednecks. They were waiting for a sign.Chuck Moonchow is a self-taught painter, a self-proclaimed ""ridge runner"" from West Virginia, an exile from the planet Murania, and an expert Dungeons & Dragons player. In fact, the Angry Rednecks shed would soon become the location for 6 months of heated D&D encounters with Cole, Prescott, and McCarthy (as Dungeon Master) while Chuck antagonized as an evil wizard. Many of Chuck's zany quotes from these 1983 games (and fanzine interviews) will be used verbatim in ""The Angry Rednecks"" graphic novel. The real Chuck is very similar to the cartoon Chuck because he blurred the lines of fantasy and reality.Chuck met Mike McCarthy in 1978 and quickly became an antidote for McCarthy's pre-punk lackadaisical existence in Mississippi . There are numerous Chuck Moonshow references in many of McCarthy's film projects. Simply put, Chuck Moonchow is Mike McCarthy's guru. After the move to Memphis in 1984, George and Mike would form a new rock & roll band that needed a name if they were to play the ""world famous"" Antenna Club. McCarthy asked Moonchow to come up with a band name. Chuck suggested the monicker ""Distemper”. The rest was history (of an underground sort).If McCarthy and Cole weren't collaborating on comics, they were playing together in bands. In the Eric Page photograph below, McCarthy (singing) and Cole (far right) play their last Distemper gig at the Antenna in December, 1986. Luckily, when the bands (or the films) played out, there was always comics books. In the The Angry Rednecks comic book world of 1984, Chuck Moonchow gives ""The Angry Rednecks"" it's very name and mission by encouraging Tommy, Sam, and Sherman to destroy at will.

Of course, it has and is a challenge to balance and manage the time to work on DNotW since there's people and life in the way. Nonetheless, DNotW is my objective in life and will always be a priority, especially now. What Happens After the Campaign?Now that you've gotten this far I have to say you have great fucking taste in comics, and most importantly, I'd just like to state in the moment I've published this campaign and this comic has officially been revealed to public eyes Damned Nation of the West will be my upmost priority - my magnum opus - and my plans for what will come next after this campaign is over is to of course ship the perks to customers, and to expand the reach of DNotW and get a distributor to get it into CB stores - even beyond CB stores even, but that's just my ambition talking.  Again, publishing this Indiegogo campaign prides me to work tirelessly to bring this book in your hands in January of 2019. You won't be disappointed. If there are any questions about this project, my email is lhagomesart@gmail.com - I'm always open on Twitter, and my Instagram is where behind the scene snipbits are posted.Even if not financially, simply sharing on social media could make a difference in helping out a lot and is most appreciated! Cheers,Luis Henrique Gomes",12.0,0,"1 Campaign

</h3>
<p>Growing up in eastern North Carolina, Micah Peterson and Tim Davis were both big comic book and science fiction fans.

Moreover, this has grown into more than just a hobby for us both, and we would love to one day turn this into a full-time career as writers and illustrators!</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong><u>WHAT WE NEED</u></strong></h3>
<p>We are looking to raise a total of $15,000 through this campaign in order to see Lineage, our premier series; finished, printed, advertised, published, and distributed to stores.</p>
<p><strong>List of expenses:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Various legal fees (trademarks, copyrights, etc.) = $500</li>
<li>Printing Fees (This amount varies greatly depending on the chosen printing source, the total number of copies to be printed due to the final donation total, the individual donation amounts, etc.) = $1,200</li>

<li>Supplemental income (for us to get the project done in a timely manner.) = $4,850 (remainder)</li>
</ol>
<p>While this is certainly a project by and from Micah Peterson and Tim Davis, it is their greatest hope that this becomes something for all our members, fans, and loved ones! </p>

<p>PD Comics is more than excited to see this project become a reality. Whether we receive $50, or $50,000, Lineage and our other projects WILL BE COMPLETED! It is for this reason that we've opted to go with the ""FLEXIBLE FUNDING"" option. Every dollar and every cent donated to our cause will go directly towards the list of expenses that will see this passion project fulfilled!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><u><strong>THE IMPACT</strong></u></h3>
</div><div>
<p>So why should you donate to our cause? And why do we KNOW that people will want to hear our stories, out of so many others in this industry? What sets us apart in an industry with no shortages in original content?<br/><br/>Well, there are a few BIG reasons! Firstly, this is a series “for the fans” &amp; “by the fans”.<br/>By that, we mean that we as the series creators are, of course, fans of comic books and graphic<br/>novels. But beyond that, we’re hoping that this will also become an interactive project in which our fans will be able to influence and help decide where and how the story develops.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1527563248/fenrdpufbkbtostxtwu7.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Next, Lineage sets itself apart from other comic book titles in the way that we’ll be using it to highlight many of the lesser known parts of the country. Featuring real towns, real people, and real events. No made up metropolitan cities, and no fake regions.<br/>We’ll be starting this by having the series begin in North Carolina, and then progressing up and<br/>down the east coast over the first “season”. Where we go from there, and what lesser-known regions we show off, our fans will help decide!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1527563278/bamjl5ehibyrpbmgrhgw.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>And finally, one of the biggest things that will set Lineage apart from the competition, is the story itself! This isn’t a story of aliens, mutants, or science. But a story that will combine local and Scottish folklore into a new and refreshing origin story! Using flashbacks and branch-offs from the main storyline, we’ll get to discover just what happened to the Duncan family… and whether these abilities getting passed down are a gift, or something far more sinister.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1527563339/vkj1nw9yiqhqqmx4ks4v.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><u><strong>OTHER/FUTURE PROJECTS</strong></u></h3>
<p>Lineage isn’t the only series that we at PD Comics have in the works! That’s right, in fact, we already have a total of 5 projects in our line-up!<br/><br/><strong><u>SPECTRUM</u><u>!</u></strong><br/>After Lineage, comes what could possibly be an even bigger series!!<br/>Having worked with children with special needs, autism in particular, for most of his adult life; Tim Davis has developed the story about a boy with autism who becomes the hero we all wish we could be! Captain Hero is Andrew ""Andy"" Templeton's favorite afternoon television show. He loves superheroes and had always wanted to be one. When Andy gets the chance to meet his idol, circumstances cause Andy to be the hero he has always wanted to be. It's a story of acceptance. It's a story of understanding... And it's just plain fun! Through this set of comics we are calling ""Spectrum: The Adventures of Andy Templeton"", we hope to bring awareness to the autism community. In fact, after we print and begin to sell Spectrum, we plan to give a portion of the money earned from those copies to The Autism Society. This is a subject that is near and dear to Tim Davis' heart and is a personal calling to bring awareness to Autism Spectrum Disorder that affects 1 in 68 people in America.</p>

<p><br/><u><strong>THE TALES OF JACK EASTER</strong></u><br/>Our final project that’s still in its early conceptual stage, is “The Tales of Jack Easter”. This series will follow Jack, a bounty hunter set in a dark fantasy world that is a twisted version of the North Eastern territories and Canada, in the late 1700’s. These tales are being written as a new, and more “grim” origin story for some of the present-day traditions and fables that surround our culture and holidays. Such as the first novel, which will follow Jack as he hunts and attempts to slay a large beast, that the local villagers have claimed is a giant/monstrous rabbit.<br/><br/><strong><u>CLOCK BOY</u></strong><br/>A quirky adventure that takes notes from some of the greats like Tim Burton’s animated films, and those shows with a more innocent look… such as “Over the Garden Wall” and “Gravity Falls”. It will follow our young protagonist as he ventures through the many stages of life, which will each present themselves as varied “wonderlands” with magnificent settings and differing challenges. The world of this series stands to be one, unlike anything you’ve ever seen!<br/><br/><strong><u>LINEAGE: WITCH HUNTERS</u></strong><br/>Our fourth series that is still in early development, is a spin-off of our premiere series,<br/>Lineage! ""Witch Hunters” will tell the origin story of how the Duncans first received their abilities and the challenges that followed, during the Jacobite Rebellions of the early 1700’s in<br/>Eastern Scotland.<br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3><u><strong>RISKS &amp; CHALLENGES</strong></u></h3>
<p>Both Tim Davis and Micah Peterson currently work full-time jobs apart from the efforts to become career comic creators. This added to their growing families and the long list of pre-existing responsibilities takes away from their time to fully commit to the creation and development of these great stories. This said, they are committed to seeing this project through to its end and will do so at the most efficient and speedy pace that they can manage.<br/><br/>These challenges are one of the many reasons as to why we are here launching this campaign. The success of reaching our campaign goal would mean that both of us would have the chance to take time off from work and devote ourselves more fully to finishing Lineage #1 in a timely manner and by the intended date.</p>

<p>Hello Fans!  This new series is a highly-anticipated project from a collaboration of world-renowned talent that will bring to life a comprehensive story universe that was in the making over the past 9 years by the acclaimed team at Starlight Runner Entertainment and Thunder Reign Studios. Ku-Mighty started as a game idea that was co-developed with the living legend of Magic: The Gathering, Richard Garfield. The game launch was put on hold, wanting first to introduce the immense story of Ku-Mighty to fans. This led us to our first INDIEGOGO campaign that will bring forth this exciting property, which will take you back to the mystical origins of Earth’s mythology and then into a sci-fi fantasy adventure that will first take place on a distant planet called Esharra. The Ku-Mighty epic is deep and wide and this first issue, Rise of the Righteous, will kick things off with the introduction of the key characters on Esharra embarking on a quest to solve the mystery behind the sudden vanishing of the planet’s enigmatic ancient race and secret society - The Ku. This Issue begins at a mid-point within the overall Esharrian Era timeline of the anthology in what is known as the 6th Period of the Reign of Chaos Epoch. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1609593012/b4rwqsqq1rsjosnffpf7.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>In this Period, the main protagonist,  Pan-Ku, has just finished assembling a select team of experts in their respective domain of both intellectual and combat.  This band of ""Anthros"", in which they are referred to as, is comprised of scientists, linguists, astronomers, alchemists, archeologists, geographers, engineers and of course warriors in addition to others, who offer some unsavory, but useful skill sets. Pan-Ku has commissioned this team as the ""Collectors"" - Whose mission is to hunt for clues, artifacts &amp; relics of the Ku and to protect them from falling into the hands of those who would use that knowledge and power in order to dominate and rule. This Expeditionary hunt across a menacing and battle-scarred planet, starts at an excavation site in the Northern most region of Esharra at a long-lost Ku temple. The voyage continues south with danger erupting around every corner and seemingly insurmountable challenges threatening the mission at every turn. New alliances are forged to strengthen the team and to advance Pan-Ku's campaign.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1609785754/zeq8pivhrva3sgqu50wp.png"" src=""""/></p>

<p>However, the story runs much deeper, as Pan-Ku and his Collectors are not only being pursued by competing powers and frequently confronted by monstrous dangers, there is also whispers of a prophecy of a forthcoming apocalyptic threat. There are times of fierce combat and heroics, the rise of one's spirit for overcoming the enduring struggle in the fight to survive, as well as the relentless quest for the truth of what happened to the Ku. There will be themes of love, loss and sacrifice, and the trope of finding friendship and the building of uncompromising loyalty to new alliances as well as to those who stand, and fight, beside you. The collective journey of the story's characters will present ""distant mountains"" to climb, which will reveal yet another chapter of the Ku-Mighty saga.</p>
<p>Fans will experience the odyssey and adventure of the Collectors and learn of the interwoven legends and mythology that will reveal the linkages to Earth. Fans will also learn how Earth's true history has been disguised by mythology. Each voyage, discovery, battle, victory, and tragedy will paint the story for the fans to track, explore and dive deeper into the mysteries that veil the story's conclusion. Learn more about the story and characters at: <a href=""http://www.ku-mighty.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Ku-Mighty.com</a> and join the mailing list for news and exclusive fan story details, distant mountain clues and dialog. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I'm Josh. Alex and I are working hard to create The Barks because we love comics, and music, and dogs. We put them all together and we're having a ton of fun doing it.<br/>But, we could use some money to help us get the books printed and then get to cons, shows, and stores to get the books in to the grubby little hands of our readers.</p>
<p>Also, Alex has been working his butt off and deserves more than I can afford to pay him right now.</p>
<p>Your contribution will not only be a public declaration of your love for comics/dogs/punk, but also your hate for bullies. NO BULLIES!</p>
<p>You can help carve out a space in the world where bullies are not allowed.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We're hoping for $1000 to pay for the artwork that's already been done on issue 1 and to get started on the next issue.</p>
<p>Regardless of what we end up with, this is the breakdown...</p>
<p>50% goes straight to Alex to pay for the art.</p>
<p>30% will go to printing.</p>
<p>10% will go to me (josh).</p>
<p>5% for stuff we didn't think of.</p>
<p>5% platform fee.</p>
<p>You will get the 3 page Indie Go Go exclusive just for our backers here (and maybe a few teaser slips here and there). You'll also be able to get digital copies of the finished The Barks #1.</p>
<p>If things go really well, we'll add ways for you to get paper copies as well... but we'll cross that bridge when we get to it.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The comics are almost completely created.</p>
<p>We're not offering paper copies to start with specifically because we don't want to get over extended.</p>
<p>Honestly, we risk offending some people with the content. And, I am just a little worried that we are biting off more than we can chew. Or, that I am over estimating the bully situation and flying off half-cocked.</p>
<p>If that's the case, I hope we can talk about it in a nice and rational way. Our parody of bullies might be a little mean... but I'm ok with that.</p>
<p>Update: If we come at #comicsgate too hard, we run the risk of getting more counter-bullying than we can handle. On the other side, if we come off as too even-handed with our treatment of them, I worry about enflaming the wrath of the ANTI side.</p>
<p>Again. MOST LIKELY this is based on my own anxiety and second guessing. It could be that no one cares at all.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I'll be super happy if this just helps get the word out about our comic.</p>
<p>I'll also be super happy to let bullies know that they stink and I don't like them. I'm happy to do that alone, but I'd be even happier if you stood with me.</p>
<p>Money is a great way to demonstrate that... but sharing sharing sharing can be even more powerful. Let the world know what you think of The Barks Hate Hate.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello, My name is Luke Stone.  I am the creator, writer, and artist behind Hybrids.  I am a full time pastor and lover of comics.  Several years ago I started making my own comics.  That eventually brought me to begin writing this story of Hybrids.</p>
<p>I have always been interested in the parts of scripture that create more questions than they answer.  Genesis 6 and the Nephilim is by far one of my favorites.  So, for 10 years I spent my spare time researching these Nephilim and reading all of the information I could find.  The culmination of that research became the basis for the story behind Hybrids: The Sons of Gods.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Issues 1-3 are already completed.  We are simply using this as a platform to distribute to new fans. Once we are funded, we will be shipping out rewards</p>
<p>What we raise will pay for print and distribution and go to help us produce the next two issues of Hybrids in this story arc.  </p>

<h3>GOING BACK TO RECLAIM THE FUTURE.</h3>
<p>I had a wildly successful campaign to fund TREKKER: THE COMPLETE JOURNEY Vol I, which collects of all of the classic Trekker stories that I had originally published through Dark Horse Comics. All of those tales had gone out of print. Now, we've rescued them! </p>
<p>But ever since the book was successfully funded, those who missed the campaign have been asking, ""Can I still get a copy of TREKKER: THE COMPLETE JOURNEY Vol I?"" Now, thanks to <strong>Indiegogo InDemand</strong> the answer is YES! </p>
<p>TREKKER: THE COMPLETE JOURNEY Vol I was originally <strong>scheduled to ship in August 2020, though between Covid and Tariff complications, it's now looking like September </strong>--and, since I ordered  extra copies, now would be a great time to snag yourself a copy of this 520+ page graphic novel. </p>
<h3>A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE 23rd CENTURY:</h3>
<p>When TREKKER first came out in the 1980s it was a ground-breaking series: A badass bounty hunter who lives by her own rules and takes orders from no one as she makes her way through the violent and complicated world of the 23rd century.</p>
<p>As <strong>Gail Simone </strong>wrote in her introduction to an earlier collection, ""<i>It's of stuff like Trekker that revolutions are begun. A female character that is sexy but not sexualized, that is tough but not without flaws and doubts, and that is dangerous but not without compassion</i>.""</p>
<p>All of those original tales are collected in this hefty, deluxe volume. Whether you are new to the world of Trekker or a long-time reader, this book is designed to thrill and to satisfy you... and to leave you wanting still more.</p>

<h3>SO, WHAT'S A TIPPED-IN PRINT?</h3>
<p>For those who, like me, might not have been familiar with the phrase ""tipped-in print,"" it's a page that is printed<i> separately </i>from the main body of the book and is then <i>bound into the book</i> by the printer. This lets us use a different paper (in this case, something with a bit of distinctive texture, since the print will be of the above watercolor I've done especially for this volume) to yield the best possible effect for this special image. Each copy will come i<i>ndividually signed and numbered by me. </i>Only 200 will be printed, and many of those were claimed in the original campaign. Just saying...<i><i> </i></i></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Well, with a book that is already done and at the printer, most of the challenges and risks are behind us. And, with three previous campaigns all successfully fulfilled right on schedule, I feel that I have a pretty good handle on how to get this done, and that I have the support system in place to help me deal quickly and efficiently with any complications that might arise.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Trekker is my absolute passion as a comics storyteller-- even after all these years, I am as excited as ever to be telling these tales and sharing them with new readers. That's why I'm happy to be using Indiegogo to help me reach even more readers. But, Indiegogo is a new realm for me, and I could use some help in spreading the word. So, if something you see here has you interested, please feel free to make some noise about it! Indiegogo has some great sharing tools, don't be afraid to use 'em!</p>

<h3>In a galaxy at risk, a young samurai will prove their greatest hope.</h3>
<p>Star Wars meets Skyrim and Seven Samurai with a bit of Rocketeer mixed in. The angel, Azrekal, served the Seven Legions for 2000 years, until he uncovered a plot to destroy them from within, but before he could warn the others, he vanished, leaving only his memories behind in the mind of Hiko, an orphan born in feudal Japan's chaotic Sengoku era. As Hiko finds himself caught in the middle of the mystery of Azrekal's disappearance he must choose between fighting the war that threatens the clan that took him in, or the war that threatens the galaxy itself.</p>
<p>Issue 1 is 20 pages, issue 2 is 30 pages.</p>
<p>Set in a universe where the races of fantasy exist on other worlds in an alliance protected by the Seven Legions. Where several human empires betrayed the alliance and the descendants of those humans live on Earth, where they have long forgotten the other races, beyond stories that have become myth and legend. There are three histories in this universe: History as we know it, history as it is known in the galaxy, and the history long forgotten. A fantasy universe grounded in science where Earth history is identical to our own but part of a much larger story.</p>

<h2>Art Team</h2>
<p>Each issue is split in two parts with different styles to separate the memories of Azrekal from the continued adventures of Hiko.</p>
<p>Issue 1:<br/>Maksis Zabers: Line art on Azrekal's memory. Unfortunately, he was not able to continue his work but he provided an interesting art style and many of the gun designs in this series before handing off to...</p>
<p>Henry Ponciano: Best known for his work on Tinsel Town, published through Alterna, Henry took over Maksis' side of the story and put out pages at a rapid pace with a clean style he continues to improve on as he goes.</p>
<p>Federico Guillen: Federico provided the entirety of the artwork on the last four pages of issue 1 in a stunning realistic style. Unfortunately things did not work out.</p>
<p>Issue 2:<br/>Henry Ponciano: Henry's speed and skill continues to impress as he continues to work on issue 2, and hopefully, on through the series as a whole as he draws the memories of Azrekal in a western comic style.</p>
<p><br/>Pablo Romero: the moment I saw Pablo's anime style I knew it had to be done. Contrasting the western style provided by Henry and separating the two halves of the story, Pablo draws his pages with speed matching Henry's and accuracy to the setting.  On occasion, he has provided reference for things that I haven't found in my research.</p>

<p>This story has been carefully built over years, with every thread connected in ways that will amaze readers as they discover the secrets of this universe.

<h2>The races of the Seven Legions Universe</h2>
<p><strong>The Humans</strong>: Like you and me, on Earth, humans have no knowledge of the other races outside of what we remember through myth and legend. The other races are cloaked by a mysterious force from human eyes.  Beyond the Earth, some humans live among the other empires of the alliance and beyond.</p>
<p><strong>The Angels</strong>: Large feathery wings, a glowing aura halo that changes color and shape with emotion. The angels have a telekinetic blast ability and pyrokinesis. The angels don't age past maturity and have accelerated healing. There are 3 variations of the angels: The Cherubim, the average angel. The Thrones, 4-winged angels genetically altered with enhanced physical and psionic abilities. The Seraphim, 6-winged angels with one of seven powers, chosen as leaders of the Seven legions.</p>
<p><strong>The Eldrian/elves</strong>: Long, pointed ears. A small, diamond-shaped bump on their foreheads. The Eldrian have telepathy, with varients in this ability. The High eldrian have telepathic communication only and human range of skin tones, the wood eldrian have illusion telepathy and golden skin, the blood eldrian can control others and have red skin, the polar eldrian can use the magnetic poles to amplify their telepathy and have pale skin, and the dark eldrian have a telepathic EMP ability and have blue skin. The Eldrian have plant-based technology, adapting the plant life of their world to serve them.</p>
<p><strong>The Darvosi/dwarves</strong>: Short, stout, and strong. The Darvosi are proud warriors from the world of Asgard, where they live in underground cities to escape their violent wildlife. They settle wars in the virtual world of Valhalla and hunt in mech suits and jet packs.</p>
<p><strong>The Undine</strong>: An aquatic race with long, finned tails and nostrils on their foreheads. Essentially, they look like dolphin people. Their tech is adapted from the rapidly-evolving fauna of their homeworld. Most prominent among them is their starships, gigantic space krackens.</p>
<p><strong>The Faer</strong>: Tall and lanky with chitinous wings and pointed ears. The Faer come from the same world as the Undine but live primarily on the islands.</p>
<p><strong>The Cobrin/Goblins</strong>: short and slender with long, pointed ears and long canine teeth. Their skin is green from a symbiotic moss that grows on their skin. </p>
<p><strong>The Orac/Orcs</strong>: The tall and bulky cousins of the Cobrin. They're similar to the Cobrin in every way but their size and lack of intelligence. </p>
<p><strong>The Daemons</strong>: Large, leathery wings, long horns, pointed ears and red skin. The daemons are brutal and hate the other races. They have access to technology far ahead of any other race, but they have fortunately kept to themselves aside from supply raids, as they wait for the return of their creators to lead them on a crusade across the galaxy. </p>

<h3>Risks</h3>
<p>This is my first campaign, and I am aware that there are hurdles.  Sometimes there are issues that lead to artists having to leave a project. I have experienced that. If that happens, I will inform the backers and we'll continue forward. Over the last two years I have found an amazing community of comic creators all working on our own projects.  We're all working together to create our dream projects, and I have a great group to turn to for help. Given the most likely printing option, there's a chance we may be delayed in printing if we do not have the issues completed before the deadline.  If the delay is too great, I will work to find another option.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

They have access to technology far ahead of any other race, but they have fortunately kept to themselves aside from supply raids, as they wait for the return of their creators to lead them on a crusade across the galaxy. 

The Seven Legions need you!
We can fund for $3,000, which will provide the funds needed to: 

finish the art for issue 2.
 print issue 1 and 2.
 print copies of Pablo Romero's pinup print, Henry Ponciano's action print, and Karl O'Rowe's villains print.
Print bookmarks by Simon SIM Pothier.
Print 4 packs of trading Cards.
 provide heavy-duty mailers.
provide bags and boards
pay for shipping.

We can fund with anywhere from 27 to 64 backers.
We're printing the books through Mixam, a high quality printing company, as a limited edition print run. 
We're recruiting the help of talented artists to provide additional posters, each 11x17, and the more stretch goals we hit, the more posters you get.



Risks
This is my first campaign, and I am aware that there are hurdles.  Sometimes there are issues that lead to artists having to leave a project. I have experienced that. If that happens, I will inform the backers and we'll continue forward. Over the last two years I have found an amazing community of comic creators all working on our own projects.  We're all working together to create our dream projects, and I have a great group to turn to for help. Given the most likely printing option, there's a chance we may be delayed in printing if we do not have the issues completed before the deadline.  If the delay is too great, I will work to find another option.

Other Ways You Can Help
Spread the word on social media! If you have a youtube channel, I'd be glad to talk to you about the project. Reach out to me on twitter @7legionsbeacon by email at michalbeacon@gmail.com find the facebook page at www.facebook.com/7legions.",12.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Once the crowdfunder has come to a close we plan on reaching out to each of our partners to confirm their order.

<p>Outpouring Comics started as a couple of friends Role Playing together 
and creating stories while in college. These stories evolved and two of 
the Role Players eventually went on to start their own universes, 
characters, and stories. Both creators brought in a small group to 
assist in creation and expansion of their universes before bringing any 
comic to readers eyes.<br/> In June 2012, the two universes merged 
together to bring about the creation of Outpouring Comics. Outpouring 
Comics made their first public appearance at the April 2014 Asbury Park 
Comic Con with the debut of VODA #1.<br/></p>
</div><br/></div>","John Orlando's impressive resume stretches back to the early nineties 
and his proven record in comics clearly shows that he is a man of many 
talents.       Originally, John Orlando began as a penciling assistant to Rich Buckler in 1994 for Buckler’s Visage Studios, assisting
 on Syphons the Sygate Strategem for Now Comics, Zaanan for Mainstream 
Comics and Gene Roddenberry’s The Lost Universe for Tekno Comics.  He 
became Production Manager for Buckler at Visage in 1995 and a penciler, 
inker, colorist, painter and letterer producing covers, page work and 
portfolio sets for various publishers. 
 John produced several 
creator-owned books in 1996-98 including the off-beat, “classic-style” 
titles Cybergen, Journey into Madness, and The Intruder. We have launched this Indiegogo to bring these three stories back to print and to bring color to Cybergen for the first time. We 
are very happy to have John join us in the never-ending quest to create 
breathtaking, pulse-pounding and unforgettable comics covering a 
plethora of genres for YOUR reading entertainment.  John is widely 
respected in the field and we at Outpouring are very happy to have him 
aboard! 

FIRST THINGS FIRST, A BIG THANKS TO ANYONE THAT SUPPORTS OUR PROJECT IN ANY WAY! YOU WILL BE RECEIVING A CREDIT ON OUR WEBSITE AND HAVE OUR UNDYING GRATITUDE!




The comics and prints are set and ready to go, all they need is the 
funding for printing. If need be we will print smaller print runs to fulfill the prize list for our contributors. We have several amazing printers we work with including one that offers reasonable prices on smaller print runs.
Once the crowdfunder has come to a close we plan on reaching out to each of our partners to confirm their order. This way there is no confusion as to what was actually ordered. We will be ready to ship within three weeks of the end of the Indiegogo which is well within the two month shipping period we allotted for ourselves. We have a full team dedicated to success that has 
been working hard since we first announced the John Orlando collection 
coming to Outpouring Comics. We are excited for this opportunity to 
share these works with you and prepared to deliver a great experience to
 all who partner with us.




Simon Kilgore has kidnapped Karen James, Doctor Warlock's former 
fiance!
  Doctor Warlock, Slither, and Cyberagent join forces as the 
dysfunctional group Cybergen to battle the mutated Kilgore and his 
monstrous synthorg Mutoids in order to save Karen. 
 Are their greater evils afoot, who are The Offspring, and what are the 
intentions of the mysterious Dr. Poole?  Find out in Cybergen.


 An aging crook runs afoul of a shape-changing alien who is on the 
lam from an intergalactic cop. The Intruder’s plan is to seize power, 
acquire wealth, and ultimately sow the seeds of destruction on the 
Earth’s population. His reason is only to revel in his success then head
 off to another planet to repeat the process. Now it is the task of the 
two cops from two worlds to stop the evil of the Intruder.

Each issue of Journey into Madness is a collection of short horror 
stories created and written by John Orlando.  The horror story 
collection in these books pays tribute to the Atlas pre-code horror 
comics of the early 1950's.

More importantly, I wanted to instill my passion in others. Being a graphic designer I love creating works of art and sharing emotions through my art.

Something that was important to me, but would also serve the purpose of making a difference. </p>

<p><i>The Other Side tells the story of how we decide to overcome the challenges we are dealt in life that make us who we are in the end. </i></p>
<p>Michael can be described as the perfect example of the word, ""normal"". Michael is a recent college graduate with a steady job, a one bedroom apartment, and average day to day responsibilities. Michael pays his bills on time, does laundry on Sundays, and even keeps his desktop organized. After what seemed to be another repetitious day folds over, ""fate"" leads Michael on the path of a beautiful girl. She's edgy, won't take no for an answer, and looks like heavy metal wrapped in a girls body. Michael thought he could try to impress her if he could even speak, but she wouldn't take much impressing because she was already in love with Michael as if she had known him for years. This all feels so strange to him, but he feels this is what his life has been missing. Michael's relationship with this mysterious girl takes him on a journey of passion and pain where his true identity is discovered.  Michael's discovery reveals that he is the aire to both thrones of heaven and hell. He must choose to become the ruler of either kingdom or will he chose his own path?</p>

<p>Indiegogo makes it possible for people like us to be able to share our creations with the world. My name is <i>Damon Odom</i> and I am the writer of The Other Side. Unfortunately, I am not a great free hand artist, but luckily I found <i>Luís Figueiredo </i>who is helping me bring my project to life. If funded the first volume of The Other Side will be able to be completed and is expected to be completed by  April 2017. Since a volume is much more than a chapter, funders won't be left waiting for the next continuation of The Other Side. Also since this is the beginning of our project, all funders will be given a digital copy of The Other Side Volume 1 if our goal is met. It would be my pleasure to share the story with you all because if it were not for you none of this would have been possible. </p>

After losing a good friend of mine to suicide and having my own experience I wanted to tell a story that gave people hope in times of tragedy. I wanted to share both of our stories with the world through the lives of the main characters and raise the importance of suicide awareness. 

 

The Other Side tells the story of how we decide to overcome the challenges we are dealt in life that make us who we are in the end. 
Michael can be described as the perfect example of the word, ""normal"". Michael is a recent college graduate with a steady job, a one bedroom apartment, and average day to day responsibilities. Michael pays his bills on time, does laundry on Sundays, and even keeps his desktop organized. After what seemed to be another repetitious day folds over, ""fate"" leads Michael on the path of a beautiful girl. She's edgy, won't take no for an answer, and looks like heavy metal wrapped in a girls body. Michael thought he could try to impress her if he could even speak, but she wouldn't take much impressing because she was already in love with Michael as if she had known him for years. This all feels so strange to him, but he feels this is what his life has been missing. Michael's relationship with this mysterious girl takes him on a journey of passion and pain where his true identity is discovered.  Michael's discovery reveals that he is the aire to both thrones of heaven and hell. He must choose to become the ruler of either kingdom or will he chose his own path?

 

Indiegogo makes it possible for people like us to be able to share our creations with the world. My name is Damon Odom and I am the writer of The Other Side. Unfortunately, I am not a great free hand artist, but luckily I found Luís Figueiredo who is helping me bring my project to life. If funded the first volume of The Other Side will be able to be completed and is expected to be completed by  April 2017. Since a volume is much more than a chapter, funders won't be left waiting for the next continuation of The Other Side. Also since this is the beginning of our project, all funders will be given a digital copy of The Other Side Volume 1 if our goal is met. It would be my pleasure to share the story with you all because if it were not for you none of this would have been possible. 
Special thanks to Luís Figueiredo. Please review his work @luisgfigueiredoart

 

Below are the levels of Perks for our supporters. Not only will you receive the perk of your level, but if our project is 100% funded every supporter will receive a digital copy of The Other Side Volume 1. Our goal would not have been met if it were not for you, therefore I feel that it is only right to share with you something we all made happen.

 

Not everyone has to make a donation to help. If you would like to help but do not have the funds to make a donation, remember, you can always help by sharing our project. Feel free to share our project where ever you feel it deserves to be seen. Thank you again for taking the time to check out The Other Side. I hope we will be able to bring to you Volume 1 and much more.",9.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are a new comic book company that has a growing universe with a big future in mind. This will involve other indie comic creator's content as well, to be promoted.</p>
<p>This all started when the creator of The Seer Chronicles (co-founder, Greg Moquin) became inspired one night to write a story—that sprouted into a trilogy. This would become one of the first projects of SeerNova Comics LLC with plans of being turned into a graphic novel. This comic will include an entire unique universe of characters as well.</p>
<p>We have a dream to create our own Comic Book Company and universe. Another dream is to help other indie comic creators help them reach their own dreams. Finally to create a unique online community where even our supporters (that's you!) can have their say.  All those who contribute will help build more projects like the interactive city maps.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Break it down for folks in more detail:</p>
<p>These funds will first and foremost go to our artists and writers because they are the heartbeat of our organization. Without them, all this would not be possible. Next it will go to our moonshot projects like the interactive virtual world of the cities.</p>
<p>Some of the perks you'll be able to get when you contribute range from social media shout outs to t shirts, a full year's subscription to our online comics and even becoming a character in our universe!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This project is more than just about us. Do we want to have a highly successful business? Absolutely. But, our primarily our goal is to help reduce the number of starving artists by giving them a platform from which to shoot their dreams from.</p>
<p>Our artists are all over the country and soon we hope to expand further. We want to help them bring their dreams into a reality as much as our own. By doing so we can help them provide for their families by doing the thing they love most, creating art.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Although we are new to the game, we are highly optimistic about the outcome. We have built a highly skilled team and a powerful network to help us mount each hurdle that comes our way. As long as we have the support of patrons like you, this dream will surely succeed.</p>
<p>Regardless of funding, we will push forward. As the saying goes ""Never give up! Never surrender!"" or ""You killed my father... Prepare to die!"" Okay maybe that last one doesn't quite fit, but you get the point. We'll be fighting tooth and nail to see this dream come into a reality, and we hope we will have your support in doing so.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Now we understand, not everyone is capable of contributing financially—believe us, we can appreciate that. However, if you'd like to show your support here's a few thing you can do:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Tell your friends and family about us!</strong> (word of mouth is a powerful tool)</li>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Mack Duncan. After spending my life as an performing artist and educator, I have decided to pursue a new creative venture. <i>AMONG US </i>is my first, and hopefully not my last, comic book.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>My skill is in writing the story and creating the ideas for the world. I do, however, require help with the visual aspects of the project. I hired some great artists to help bring the books to life, and I have been paying them fair compensation. This campaign is intended to recover some of those costs and help continue the series in the future. </p>
<p>By contributing, you will be among the first to experience this new title. I am also offering some exclusive merchandise, and an opportunity to attend the special Book Release event at The Torch Theatre in Phoenix, AZ.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>So far, two issues are ready to go, and I have at least 7 more issues in the script phase. If this campaign and subsequent sales are successful, I will be able to move quicker on realizing future issues. My plan is to retire from teaching in a few years, and allow this to be my next career.  I don't expect to be Stan Lee or Neil Gaiman, but I would like see this reach its full potential. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As I said, this is my first comic book. It's a pretty crowded field, so it will take a lot to find its audience. The original idea started out as a play I wrote in 2007. It was too complicated to stage, so it became a screenplay. Again, beyond my means and ability to produce. This world belongs in the sequential art story telling format, so I'm eager to see it flourish in its new home.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you know someone who is looking for a new comic to get into, send them my way.</p>
<p>Also, if you know of a comic book retailer who sells indie books, I'm ready to talk to them. </p>

<h3><strong>Русская версия <i>(English below)</i></strong></h3>
<p>Увлечение историей и обычаями древних славян может принимать разные формы. В жизни и верованиях наших предков многие находят глубокие корни, созидательное и объединяющее начало славянского наследия. Вот из этих мыслей автора данного проекта и родилась идея создания фэнтези-комикса с использованием современных возможностей. Но это не просто комикс, это анимированная история.</p>
<p>Над проектом работает целая команда, куда входят художники, программисты, аниматоры и даже композиторы. Именно поэтому в проекте вы найдете не только замечательные анимированные иллюстрации, но и оригинальную музыку, написанную специально для него. По сути, это электронное онлайн издание в новом формате, которое специально оптимизировано для чтения со смартфона.</p>
<p>«ВЕПРЬ» является первой историей о жизни, обычаях и верованиях славян раннего средневековья. Вот что говорят о ней сами авторы: «Молодой охотник из славянского племени Лендзян отправляется в лес по следам вепря, не подозревая, что это станет началом длинного пути, полного неведомых испытаний и приключений...». С этого читатели и начинают своё путешествие-знакомство с удивительным мифологическим миром славян.</p>
<p>Но, как и любой стартап, этот проект нуждается в поддержке. Поэтому создатели запустили кампанию краудфандинга, цель которого собрать средства на завершение первой части.</p>
<p>Краудфандинг, в чём-то похож на онлайн-магазин и подразумевает получение вознаграждения за поддержку проекта. Часть средств используется на создание и отправку этих вознаграждений, а другая часть будет использоваться по назначению для завершения работы над комиксом. Авторы создали большой ассортимент для выбора: рингтоны, обои для телефона, постеры, саундтреки, PDF-версия комикса и т.д.</p>
<p>Изначально проект задумывался как панславянский, состоящий из цикла историй, охватывающих ареал древнего расселения славян от Балтики до Греции и Малой Азии. Большая часть этих территорий по-прежнему заселена славянами, поэтому помимо русской версии создатели комикса делают также и английскую, так как английский в последние годы становится языком межславянского общения. Поэтому и платформа краудфандинга была выбрана англоязычная.</p>
<p>Вы также сильно поможете, если <strong>расскажете об этом проекте другим и сделаете на него ссылку!</strong></p>

<h3><strong>The Story</strong></h3>
<p>“BOAR” is our pilot episode of what we hope will become, a series of fantasy motion comics inspired by Slavic mythology:</p>
<p>“Young hunter from the Lendians tribe goes after a boar into the forest, not expecting that this will be the beginning of a much longer journey full of unknown trials and adventures…”</p>
<p>Sounds intriguing, right? Our ancestors lived in a world where gods and spirits were real. As a reader, you will be immersed into that world, learn about ancient customs, visit old shrines, and witness medieval fantasy adventures.</p>
<p>In fact, for our stories we conduct research in the fields of material culture, history, mythology, ethnography and geography. Even though our stories are created in a fantasy genre, we make every effort to consult on various topics with reliable scientific sources. But who proclaimed that these subjects should be boring? Did you know that the popular book “The Wonderful Adventures of Nils” by Selma Lagerlöf was actually written as a geography reader for schools in Sweden? Although our comic is for adults, it does offer new and interesting things to learn. We hope it will inspire you to set off on your own historical exploration journey.</p>
<p>And now, meet the characters of the “BOAR” story:</p>

<p>We hope you enjoyed watching the initial piece of the comic, and now understand what we mean by “absolutely amazing and unique”! We might consider publishing a printed version in the future, but right now our approach is about digital media and digital user experience, which comes with new technological possibilities. Still, it is a comic <i>book</i>. In fact, you will be doing quite some reading, as it has even more text than traditional comics.</p>
<p>This is how the panels of a motion comic are outlined before the animation process starts:</p>

</div><div>
<h3><strong>The Team</strong></h3>
<p>The story was written by <i><strong>Slavomir and Miro Lysak</strong></i>, in addition, there is a highly skilled crew working on creation of the comic:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong><u>Illustrations</u>: <i>Anastasia Barlett</i></strong>, experienced cartoon and book illustrator, digital art and water colouring enthusiast</li>
<li>
<strong><u>Music and Sound Effects</u>: <i>Denis Tarasov</i></strong>, globally acclaimed song writer, sound editor and game developer</li>

</div><div>
<h3><strong>The Budget</strong></h3>
<p>Currently, we have only produced the initial piece of the first chapter “BOAR” (about 25% of the whole story) and placed it online for viewing and beta testing. The story script and all of the illustrations are finished, but we need to complete the animation, sound editing and programming for the remaining part, which is roughly 75%. The funding will be targeted for that purpose.</p>
<p>Of all the funds raised, around a half of the amount will be invested for development. Platform and processing fees must be paid, as well as the cost of producing and shipping the perks.</p>
<p>We are putting together a <strong>$5,000 initial funding target</strong>. In reality, we would like to surpass this amount, so that we will be able to move beyond the first pilot episode. Here are future plans if through your support we raise more money than our initial target:</p>
<p><strong>$10,000</strong> – the first episode will be produced, and we will start working on the second and third episodes’ storyboard<br/><strong>$25,000</strong> – we will create a new web experience for you and start production of the next two episodes<br/><strong>$50,000</strong> – we will expand production into a whole First Season!<br/><strong>$100,000</strong> – we will launch a Second Season production, and with possibly a printed adaptation of the comic, depending on demand<br/><strong>$200,000</strong> – we will invest to enhance your digital experience and start a mobile app development</p>
<p>We are planning publication of the full “BOAR” episode by end of <strong>May 2020</strong>. In the interim we will also be releasing the first half of the episode, once it is completed.</p>
<p>Please remember that <strong>EVERY DOLLAR HELPS!</strong> </p>
<p>And that we <strong>THANK YOU SINCERELY</strong> for your support and contribution!</p>
</div><div>

We will offer a wide range of downloads, from the original music soundtracks and ringtones to the phone wallpaper and print-it-yourself posters.

We bring to life the great cultural and spiritual heritage of the Slavic people. We produce an animated fantasy comic book series about the customs and beliefs of the Slavic tribes in the early Middle Ages.
Three things are very unique about our animated comic book:

All the creators are passionate about Slavic mythology and history. We have turned this passion into an exciting story for you
This is a digital comic optimised for smartphone viewing
We created completely new user experience with breathtaking illustrations, animation, original music and sound effects


The initial piece of the first chapter “BOAR” is already finished and posted online for viewing – now we need your help to raise funds for the completion of the full first chapter.

Русская версия (English below)
Увлечение историей и обычаями древних славян может принимать разные формы. В жизни и верованиях наших предков многие находят глубокие корни, созидательное и объединяющее начало славянского наследия. Вот из этих мыслей автора данного проекта и родилась идея создания фэнтези-комикса с использованием современных возможностей. Но это не просто комикс, это анимированная история.
Над проектом работает целая команда, куда входят художники, программисты, аниматоры и даже композиторы. Именно поэтому в проекте вы найдете не только замечательные анимированные иллюстрации, но и оригинальную музыку, написанную специально для него. По сути, это электронное онлайн издание в новом формате, которое специально оптимизировано для чтения со смартфона.
«ВЕПРЬ» является первой историей о жизни, обычаях и верованиях славян раннего средневековья. Вот что говорят о ней сами авторы: «Молодой охотник из славянского племени Лендзян отправляется в лес по следам вепря, не подозревая, что это станет началом длинного пути, полного неведомых испытаний и приключений...». С этого читатели и начинают своё путешествие-знакомство с удивительным мифологическим миром славян.
Но, как и любой стартап, этот проект нуждается в поддержке. Поэтому создатели запустили кампанию краудфандинга, цель которого собрать средства на завершение первой части.
Краудфандинг, в чём-то похож на онлайн-магазин и подразумевает получение вознаграждения за поддержку проекта. Часть средств используется на создание и отправку этих вознаграждений, а другая часть будет использоваться по назначению для завершения работы над комиксом. Авторы создали большой ассортимент для выбора: рингтоны, обои для телефона, постеры, саундтреки, PDF-версия комикса и т.д.
Изначально проект задумывался как панславянский, состоящий из цикла историй, охватывающих ареал древнего расселения славян от Балтики до Греции и Малой Азии. Большая часть этих территорий по-прежнему заселена славянами, поэтому помимо русской версии создатели комикса делают также и английскую, так как английский в последние годы становится языком межславянского общения. Поэтому и платформа краудфандинга была выбрана англоязычная.
Вы также сильно поможете, если расскажете об этом проекте другим и сделаете на него ссылку!

The Story
“BOAR” is our pilot episode of what we hope will become, a series of fantasy motion comics inspired by Slavic mythology:
“Young hunter from the Lendians tribe goes after a boar into the forest, not expecting that this will be the beginning of a much longer journey full of unknown trials and adventures…”
Sounds intriguing, right? Our ancestors lived in a world where gods and spirits were real. As a reader, you will be immersed into that world, learn about ancient customs, visit old shrines, and witness medieval fantasy adventures.
In fact, for our stories we conduct research in the fields of material culture, history, mythology, ethnography and geography. Even though our stories are created in a fantasy genre, we make every effort to consult on various topics with reliable scientific sources. But who proclaimed that these subjects should be boring? Did you know that the popular book “The Wonderful Adventures of Nils” by Selma Lagerlöf was actually written as a geography reader for schools in Sweden? Although our comic is for adults, it does offer new and interesting things to learn. We hope it will inspire you to set off on your own historical exploration journey.
And now, meet the characters of the “BOAR” story:


The Format
We live in 2020, so yes – this is a digital animated comic optimised for viewing on your smartphones! We have created an absolutely amazing and unique reading experience with music, sounds and animation. In addition, we would like to point out that no application or special software installation is required to view our comics – this is an app-free experience with a standard mobile Internet browser on your smartphone.
Go and check it out for yourselves – we put a first part of the story online for you to get the feel of it (use your smartphone for viewing):

**********************************************
We hope you enjoyed watching the initial piece of the comic, and now understand what we mean by “absolutely amazing and unique”! We might consider publishing a printed version in the future, but right now our approach is about digital media and digital user experience, which comes with new technological possibilities. Still, it is a comic book. In fact, you will be doing quite some reading, as it has even more text than traditional comics.
This is how the panels of a motion comic are outlined before the animation process starts:


The Team
The story was written by Slavomir and Miro Lysak, in addition, there is a highly skilled crew working on creation of the comic:


Illustrations: Anastasia Barlett, experienced cartoon and book illustrator, digital art and water colouring enthusiast

Music and Sound Effects: Denis Tarasov, globally acclaimed song writer, sound editor and game developer

Animation: Vitalina Prokhorenko, graduate in book illustration and animation, who works with various publishing houses

Technical Project Management and Programming: Andrey Zheludkov, seasoned code writing, animation and application development guru

Web Development: Andrey Struzh, internationally commended web design, CMS and software development expert


The Budget
Currently, we have only produced the initial piece of the first chapter “BOAR” (about 25% of the whole story) and placed it online for viewing and beta testing. The story script and all of the illustrations are finished, but we need to complete the animation, sound editing and programming for the remaining part, which is roughly 75%. The funding will be targeted for that purpose.
Of all the funds raised, around a half of the amount will be invested for development. Platform and processing fees must be paid, as well as the cost of producing and shipping the perks.
We are putting together a $5,000 initial funding target. In reality, we would like to surpass this amount, so that we will be able to move beyond the first pilot episode. Here are future plans if through your support we raise more money than our initial target:
$10,000 – the first episode will be produced, and we will start working on the second and third episodes’ storyboard$25,000 – we will create a new web experience for you and start production of the next two episodes$50,000 – we will expand production into a whole First Season!$100,000 – we will launch a Second Season production, and with possibly a printed adaptation of the comic, depending on demand$200,000 – we will invest to enhance your digital experience and start a mobile app development
We are planning publication of the full “BOAR” episode by end of May 2020. In the interim we will also be releasing the first half of the episode, once it is completed.
Please remember that EVERY DOLLAR HELPS! 
And that we THANK YOU SINCERELY for your support and contribution!

The Perks
Most of our perks are digital – just the way this motion comic is created for the readers of the 21st century. We will offer a wide range of downloads, from the original music soundtracks and ringtones to the phone wallpaper and print-it-yourself posters. We will consider your suggestions in case you want something special to be added to the list.
Most of the perks are expected to be shipped out by May 2020.Shipping for digital perks is FREE.

I have never seen the Mandalorian, but I'd heard enough references to Spaghetti Westerns that I had an idea. This is Nexus as Western.The Squib Triplets (Squiblets) are adorable prodigies. At age five, they share an ESP link. They can communicate instantly with each other--even through black holes. When they are kidnapped, their parents appeal to Nexus. The CYNdicate took them to communicate across space and time, manipulating currencies and commodities.Bob Squibb is on Xofluza. Lucy Squibb is on Skyrizi, a thousand parsecs away. And Shiloh is on Ozempic, an artificial world equidistant from the others. Nexus tracks them down one by one. But all is not as it seems. The CYNdicate anticipates Nexus' involvement and has laid a trap for him.Nexus is the Man With No Name as he travels from one remote settlement to the next."" -Mike BaronWith art by the illustrious KELSEY SHANNON, this is a 22-page adventure not to be missed!

<p>We Kill The Dead is a horror/action comic that is a love letter to the slasher genre.  It is about a secret government agency whose mission is to combat thano-sapiens, undead killers such as Jason or Freddy. This first story of a planned trilogy entails Joanna, a survivor of a thano-sapien attack at her college, who enlists in the SSTB (Supernatural Special Tactics Bureau). Shortly after she joins, Jack the Ripper returns as a demonic being, last seen when SSTB leader, Nathan Scrimm, blew his head off with a grenade in the 80's. Now Jo, Nate, and the more-than-slightly-disturbed Agent Cooper race to discover the secret to stopping the legendary serial killer while battling an army of thano-sapiens under Jack's control. </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>To make this comic a reality, we needs funds. I have been in contact with a publishing company up in Canada and have received a quote where I can print 5000 units of a 32 page comic book for about $2000.

We hit that, and the first issue will be out as soon as January 1st of 2016!<br/><br/>We have some great perks. We have issues, signed items, Indiegogo exclusive tee shirts and prints, mp3's, opportunities to be drawn into the book, the list goes on! And it all leads up to an amazing horror comic written by a horror fan for horror fans!</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>This is a horror comic written by a horror fan for other horror fans. If you like slasher films, action movies, or horror comics, this is going to be a story you don't want to miss! This is a love letter to the slasher genre! </p>
<p>We are also, with our 15 cameos from different independently owned characters, breaking a world record for most separately owned characters appearing in a comic book crossover and as such we plan to get this record certified by Guinness upon publication!

 I'm John Lepper. Horror is my life. Ever since my dad showed me Halloween when I was a teenager, I have been obsessed with horror and, in particular, slashers. While I was in high school, I came up with an idea for a story about a government agency that fights slashers.

That was almost a decade ago. Now I own and write for theblood-shed.com, a horror news site. I produce, act, and do special effects for horror films. Horror is my life. And I am now, with the help of artist Bryan Revell and letterer Alex Giles, ready to make my story a reality. 




We Kill The Dead is a horror/action comic that is a love letter to the slasher genre.  It is about a secret government agency whose mission is to combat thano-sapiens, undead killers such as Jason or Freddy. This first story of a planned trilogy entails Joanna, a survivor of a thano-sapien attack at her college, who enlists in the SSTB (Supernatural Special Tactics Bureau). Shortly after she joins, Jack the Ripper returns as a demonic being, last seen when SSTB leader, Nathan Scrimm, blew his head off with a grenade in the 80's. Now Jo, Nate, and the more-than-slightly-disturbed Agent Cooper race to discover the secret to stopping the legendary serial killer while battling an army of thano-sapiens under Jack's control. 



We are also featuring cameos from 15 actual slashers from actual horror movies, having been granted this right by their copyright holders. For instance, we have access to Stitches the clown from Stitches:

About the Creator






Mark Lowery is weird. He loves stories. He loves comics. He loves films...and music...and books...and games...and making things; his background is a varied one indeed.

Hi! I'm Dan Green


I'm a gay artist from Idaho, who now lives in Portland, Oregon. I'm also an ex-mormon who is still trying to help my family. My family and I love each other, but it can be tricky finding common ground sometimes. 


I'm trying to introduce a gay comic I've been working on. MY KIND of LOVE is different from the other comics that are out there. It isn't geared toward children, but is something you don't have to hide when they come to visit. In fact, that's why I created it. 

I wanted something MY family, and MY friends could enjoy, a book that could be left out on the coffee table (or Postum table ;-) ) without worrying what Grandma or the kids might be exposed to ... (That seems to be a novel concept, for some reason.)  It's something they will be able to see and enjoy, without having it be some big deal. 

The comic panels are funny, but not crude or graphic.

You can see several of the characters in the Gallery here, (gallery tab at top) along with some basic descriptions of the characters. Be sure to give it a look, and who knows... maybe you'll see yourself, or someone you know in some of the characters!       





My Goal

 I am trying to raise money to print a book of my comics. This is my first experience with crowd-sourcing, and I need to raise enough money so that I can print a large quantity ...so that the individual book price will be affordable.  
 I'd love it if my book of gay comics was able to make its way to coffee tables in all kinds of homes. It's not geared towards little kids specifically, but it's the kind of book you can have around children, and not have to worry about things that are completely inappropriate ... It's the kind of book I wouldn't mind having around, even if my nieces and nephews were flipping through it. It's something my family could have on their coffee tables, and not have to worry about having their kids see it...

MY KIND of LOVE is a much kinder, gentler, ""normal-er"" comic. 
Hopefully this will be  just the beginning for this project! After this book is completed, I have several more ideas for the project... and your support really will help make it happen!







What I Need to Succeed

   I need $2000 to print at least 250 copies of the book first, to keep the per copy cost reasonable. (The more I can print, the less each book costs.) The book will be a high quality paperback with a full color cover, in a large 8 x 10 format, with at least 72 pages. I can do a lot with a little!

<p>My name is Drew Ford, and I am the author behind 
the new comic book anthology SPECULATE.  With each issue of SPECULATE, I
 will delve into a different region of genre fiction, be it science 
fiction, fantasy, horror, crime or just plain good ol' weirdness.  With 
your help, SPECULATE can become a regular part of the comic book 
landscape.  The plan is to release new issues four times per year.  If 
the book is successful beyond my wildest expectations, I am open to 
releasing it more regularly.  In case you didn't notice, the entire book
 (inlcuding the cover) will be presented in beautiful black and white!</p>

 successful, the $3000 will be used to design, print and distribute the 
first issue of what will hopefully become a regularly recurring title.  
If we are able to raise more than $3000, the extra money will go 
directly towards SPECULATE #2!<br/><br/>As for rewards, I have tried to 
keep it simple.  For $10 flat, you get a digital copy of SPECULATE sent 
to your e-mail box.  For $15 ($10 plus $5 s&amp;h), you get a physical 
copy of this science fiction issue of SPECULATE mailed to your front 
door.  For $20 you get one of each!  For $30 you get one of each, plus 
one copy each of my 90s science fiction and fantasy anthology COSMIC 
WAVES #1-3.  For $50, retailers can get 10 copies of the book at 50% off
 the cover price!  For $100 you can pick up two print copies of the book
 and a phone call with me to talk comics and such.  For $250 you get two
 print copies, a phone call and my personal editorial notes on any ONE 
comic book script you are working on (not to exceed 32 pages).  I am an 
editor in my 9-5 job, and am lucky enough to be working with incredible 
folks like Sam Glanzman, Chuck Dixon, J.M. DeMatteis, Alex Simmons, 
David Michelinie, Bret Blevins, Stephen Murphy, Michael Zulli, Harlan 
Ellison, Carl Potts, Jim Lawson, Jeff Nicholson, and many more on a 
variety of comic book and graphic novel related projects.  I will be 
more than happy to pass along any editorial knowledge I might have 
picked up along the way, to you and your script.<br/><br/>And that about 
does it!  The stories (writing AND art) are completed.  We simply need 
to raise the money to design the book, print the book and distribute 
(which includes those NASTY shipping costs!) the book.  In the above 
stories, I hope you will see something that piques your interest, and 
will consider throwing us a few dollars towards making this FIRST EVER 
science fiction issue of SPECULATE a reality!  Thanks for taking a look!<br/> <br/>-DF</p>

the new comic book anthology SPECULATE.  With each issue of SPECULATE, I
 will delve into a different region of genre fiction, be it science 
fiction, fantasy, horror, crime or just plain good ol' weirdness.  With 
your help, SPECULATE can become a regular part of the comic book 
landscape.  The plan is to release new issues four times per year.  If 
the book is successful beyond my wildest expectations, I am open to 
releasing it more regularly.  In case you didn't notice, the entire book
 (inlcuding the cover) will be presented in beautiful black and white!

This first issue focuses on the genre of science fiction, and contains six stories.
1. THE COVER UP (illustrated by Tony Lorenz & Larry Blake)Aliens are real...and you won't believe just how deep THE COVER UP goes!
2. AND EVEN THE PEOPLE ARE FORGOTTEN (illustrated by Russ Miller)In the far flung future, one zookeeper tries to save some very familiar animals!
3. THE PARABLE OF TWO MARTIANS (illustrated by G.M. Danzey)

Life lessons can be rather tough...especially on the surface of Mars!
4. ONE (illustrated by Chris Eisert)An extraterrestrial struggles with the fate of ONE human child.
5. THE COST OF FREEDOM (illustrated by Helmut Eppich)People love to fight...and hate.  Both now, and in the future.
6. UNIQUE (illustrated by Yul Tolbert)What if the artificial life we create doesn't want to live?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------If
 successful, the $3000 will be used to design, print and distribute the 
first issue of what will hopefully become a regularly recurring title.  
If we are able to raise more than $3000, the extra money will go 
directly towards SPECULATE #2!As for rewards, I have tried to 
keep it simple.  For $10 flat, you get a digital copy of SPECULATE sent 
to your e-mail box.  For $15 ($10 plus $5 s&h), you get a physical 
copy of this science fiction issue of SPECULATE mailed to your front 
door.  For $20 you get one of each!  For $30 you get one of each, plus 
one copy each of my 90s science fiction and fantasy anthology COSMIC 
WAVES #1-3.  For $50, retailers can get 10 copies of the book at 50% off
 the cover price!  For $100 you can pick up two print copies of the book
 and a phone call with me to talk comics and such.  For $250 you get two
 print copies, a phone call and my personal editorial notes on any ONE 
comic book script you are working on (not to exceed 32 pages).  I am an 
editor in my 9-5 job, and am lucky enough to be working with incredible 
folks like Sam Glanzman, Chuck Dixon, J.M. DeMatteis, Alex Simmons, 
David Michelinie, Bret Blevins, Stephen Murphy, Michael Zulli, Harlan 
Ellison, Carl Potts, Jim Lawson, Jeff Nicholson, and many more on a 
variety of comic book and graphic novel related projects.  I will be 
more than happy to pass along any editorial knowledge I might have 
picked up along the way, to you and your script.And that about 
does it!  The stories (writing AND art) are completed.  We simply need 
to raise the money to design the book, print the book and distribute 
(which includes those NASTY shipping costs!) the book.  In the above 
stories, I hope you will see something that piques your interest, and 
will consider throwing us a few dollars towards making this FIRST EVER 
science fiction issue of SPECULATE a reality!  Thanks for taking a look! -DF",7.0,0,"4 Campaigns

<p>Co-founded by the designer duo, Lupa and Larry. PONYO PORCO is named after the two axolotls of the designers.

<p>At the launch of the brand, we expected to surpass clothing categories and focus on hand-drawn patterns. The brand combines different media, applies unique visual concepts, and integrates their ingenuity to express a delicate sense of amusement. These are then extended into different products such as paper products, homeware, socks, hats, scarves, bags and clothes.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>From the products to the overall imagery, we hope to deliver an impression that is magical, equipped with a sense of sleekness, and enriched with the literary metaphors in adult fairy tales. </p>

They are respectively illustrated in: POOL, MERMAIDLAND, </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">CHAOS IN PURITY</span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">, </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">WITCH &amp;CROWS </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">, </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">DARKCROWS</span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">.</span><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>Floaters literally refer to floating objects. As a result of the obsession for different floating organic forms, the complex and distorted conditions of all the characters are hidden under the seemingly fairytale-like decorations. In fact, this poses a question about the nil existence of people or objects in the world. </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1466203213/PRB_Ponyo_Porco-Cover-02_kx3ywu.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Lupa often creates characters with self-invented logics about the world, and loves to express a glimpse of cold, dark charm in her naïve style. She is especially attracted to seemingly inanimate organic forms, and also likes to demonstrate an event or scene narratively.</p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">On the other hand, the brand’s image and graphic designer Larry, likes classic and coherent colors. He works on the main graphic visual designs and packaging designs. Colors are an especially important part of emphasis, and the colors of this season are a match of tender milk tea and calm, neutral sapphire.</span><br/></p>

<p>Moreover, photographer Sydney Sie, is specially invited this season to express the visual effects of a constructed reality through authentic, forced-perspective, and non-composite photography, along with a mysterious and interesting story plot.</p>

</div>
<div>Our primary concern was whether the design’s expression could faithfully convey  the brand spirit. Hence, we not only selected different backing fabric based on  the different styles of each printing pattern before production, but also repeatedly proofed and corrected their colors. We also supervised the production process to ensure every sewing detail is well-done, as well as specially ordered custom-made clothing materials and accessories. </div>
<div>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1466190780/%E6%B5%B7%E5%A0%B1%EF%BC%A13_%E5%A4%96%E7%AD%90-01_tndv9e.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>These troublesome and critical measures further refined the illustration of our clothing samples. We received successive invitations from foreign and local stylists, brans, bands, and independent magazine to work on photography and collaborative projects even before the full information was released to the general public! While we deeply appreciate the support from these great friends, we also become more determined in our beliefs.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1466203483/%E6%B5%B7%E5%A0%B1%EF%BC%A13-02_t3jirk.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Our original plan was to launch high quality and price-friendly products even if our profits would be reduced. We hope that everyone can wear our design with reasonable price in daily life. However, our expectation for high quality products and way of small productions drastically increased our cost. The only way to launch the products at the original prices is to have a sufficient number of orders. This is why we need to adopt the “Preorder &amp; Crowdfunding” approach in order to  successfully launch the branding project and production!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Please join the preorder if you like our works. Let’s activate PONYO PORCO’s branding project for the present and the future!</p>

<h3>Sydney Sie </h3>
<p></p>
<p>  “Iridescent like the collective unconsciousness of an eternally sun-lit, tropical city of neon.” </p>
<p>Sydney Sie is a photographer as well as a graphic designer and Animator. She uses gradients of color, surreal imagery, the female body, and other graphical elements of composition, color, and layout to construct ambiguous, two dimensional worlds in her photographs. </p>
<p>Sydney Sie’s creative approach to photography is to create a strong impression of the external form with an implied narrative buried within. She deliberately uses the inertia of the viewer’s attention to move beyond the bright colors and into the narrative story. </p>

<br/><p><br/></p><p></p></div>","Launched in the end of summer 2015, PONYO PORCO is a brand that focuses on the theme of hand-painted prints. 
Co-founded by the designer duo, Lupa and Larry. PONYO PORCO is named after the two axolotls of the designers. On the logo, the two magical creatures are conjoined in a pair with asymmetric features in details, which not only suggests the harmonies and differences between individuals, but also symbolizes the brands philosophy.

The designer duo is specialized in using vivid visual language to create mythical imageries where harmony and contrast co-exist. The blend of magical, realistic printing patterns and simple, straight-forward cuts produces a unique fashion deconstruction. The visual concept hopes to inspire viewers to explore the intriguing narratives behind the designs by their imaginations. Moreover, PONYO PORCO uses its intuitive spirit and aesthetics with a soul to illustrate rhythmic and musical creations.
At the launch of the brand, we expected to surpass clothing categories and focus on hand-drawn patterns. The brand combines different media, applies unique visual concepts, and integrates their ingenuity to express a delicate sense of amusement. These are then extended into different products such as paper products, homeware, socks, hats, scarves, bags and clothes.


From the products to the overall imagery, we hope to deliver an impression that is magical, equipped with a sense of sleekness, and enriched with the literary metaphors in adult fairy tales. 





Since we operate on small productions, we pay a lot of attention to the quality of our products. We hope to convey our diligence and sincerity to every customer, while making our high quality, unique products available to them at reasonable prices. We aim to deliver the feeling of collectibles and sustainability, rather than the pursuit of popular trends or fast fashion.

Although our company is currently at the start of its establishment, it has already expended a large amount of cost in preparatory operations, design, packaging, photography, human resource, and manufacturing. As we hope to have more printing enthusiasts from abroad to support our vitality, we have released various combinations of promotions on this platform for sponsors around the world to obtain the most dedicated and high quality products.    












[ The Floaters ]
In bedtime story, The sun and the witch with magic and crowsCrocodiles, snakes, and mermaids swim in the Bermuda pool Girl in a split, color-changing tail, Skull and the amputated body Appears all in five chapters With images of innocence and chaos Branded in layers on the fabric As night approachesChoose a duvet for your body and mind tonight.
About the print


The collection of “Floaters” from season one comprised of 5 printing designs that were hand-painted by artist Lupa. They are respectively illustrated in: POOL, MERMAIDLAND, CHAOS IN PURITY, WITCH &CROWS , DARKCROWS.

Floaters literally refer to floating objects. As a result of the obsession for different floating organic forms, the complex and distorted conditions of all the characters are hidden under the seemingly fairytale-like decorations. In fact, this poses a question about the nil existence of people or objects in the world. 




Lupa often creates characters with self-invented logics about the world, and loves to express a glimpse of cold, dark charm in her naïve style. She is especially attracted to seemingly inanimate organic forms, and also likes to demonstrate an event or scene narratively.
On the other hand, the brand’s image and graphic designer Larry, likes classic and coherent colors. He works on the main graphic visual designs and packaging designs. Colors are an especially important part of emphasis, and the colors of this season are a match of tender milk tea and calm, neutral sapphire.



Moreover, photographer Sydney Sie, is specially invited this season to express the visual effects of a constructed reality through authentic, forced-perspective, and non-composite photography, along with a mysterious and interesting story plot.



Now, after all these challenges and efforts, this collection can finally be displayed to everyone in the world here. It will introduce Ponyo Porco’s  magic, charm, and colors to more people’s lives.

August 27th - September 5th : Indiegogo  will send us funds to pay for the products and incentives if project is fully funded. 
September 5th - September 12th : Payment will be sent to our manufacturing company to make the products. 
September - November : Products will be made and shipped. 
November - December : Products will be received and packaged with appropriate incentives and sent off to backers!
If delays happen along the way we will keep everyone fully updated. Please note that we have already included a bit of time padding to help avoid delays.



Our primary concern was whether the design’s expression could faithfully convey  the brand spirit. Hence, we not only selected different backing fabric based on  the different styles of each printing pattern before production, but also repeatedly proofed and corrected their colors. We also supervised the production process to ensure every sewing detail is well-done, as well as specially ordered custom-made clothing materials and accessories. 



These troublesome and critical measures further refined the illustration of our clothing samples. We received successive invitations from foreign and local stylists, brans, bands, and independent magazine to work on photography and collaborative projects even before the full information was released to the general public! While we deeply appreciate the support from these great friends, we also become more determined in our beliefs.

Our original plan was to launch high quality and price-friendly products even if our profits would be reduced. We hope that everyone can wear our design with reasonable price in daily life. However, our expectation for high quality products and way of small productions drastically increased our cost. The only way to launch the products at the original prices is to have a sufficient number of orders. This is why we need to adopt the “Preorder & Crowdfunding” approach in order to  successfully launch the branding project and production!

Please join the preorder if you like our works. Let’s activate PONYO PORCO’s branding project for the present and the future!

Website： www.ponyoporco.comIG： www.instagram.com/ponyoporcoFB： www.facebook.com/ponyoporco/

  During this project, we need to accumulate preorders that worth at least $9,000 in order to launch the final stage of the production process, and deliver our products to your home.  
The most recent progress on other crowdfunding projects will continue to be updated on this page, and email notifications will also be delivered to consumers/sponsors.

Sydney Sie 

  “Iridescent like the collective unconsciousness of an eternally sun-lit, tropical city of neon.” 
Sydney Sie is a photographer as well as a graphic designer and Animator. She uses gradients of color, surreal imagery, the female body, and other graphical elements of composition, color, and layout to construct ambiguous, two dimensional worlds in her photographs. 
Sydney Sie’s creative approach to photography is to create a strong impression of the external form with an implied narrative buried within. She deliberately uses the inertia of the viewer’s attention to move beyond the bright colors and into the narrative story. 
Nominated: 2012 Melbourne International- Animation Festival (MIAF) Kinofest Festival Animex Festival Monstra Festival Golden Kuker -Sofia Festival Lucania Festival

Introduction (ENG)
Hello everybody!
My name is Carla, but I am known as Kumi, the name I chose to represent me years ago because I love Japan.
I'd like to present you my project: Kitsune to Neko, The Fox and the Cat.
KtN is a project born completely by chance: it was created for a comics marathon, but has exploded beyond every expectation, with the support of you readers.  Inspired by ancient Japanese paintings, the style is often delicate or with nearly absent colors, in order to give the right atmosphere for each scene. It's a style that I have studied and researched for a long time and now it's finally becoming familiar.

The Plot
 
It's an age when demons and spirits are walking and interact with human lives: trying to help or create a contact in case of benevolent spirits, or killing them for fun. A very powerful human warrior, however, is fighting the latters.
The Honorable Shinju, very powerful demon fox that can transform herself into a beautiful woman, is chosen to kill this strong human enemy. But what for Shinju seemed a trivial task, for breaking her century-old routine, turns out to be harder than expected and completely disrupts her plans... when she discovers that the ""Cat"" is but a woman!

KtN is still an incomplete comic. What is going to be printed, the goal of this campain, is the Volume 0. It will contain the chapters already published on the web, corrected and with new tables, plus a totally new chapter that will close the first arc of the story!
The raised funds will help me print the hard copies that many are asking for and help me a little with the life's expenses!
If I can reach the agreed goal, I will be able to print around 100 to 150 copies. If the goal is not reached, I'll just print the booked copies and send them to their respective owners and... I'll keep the rest aside to print additional copies later! ^_^

The Image guys inspired me to pick up a pencil and start taking my art serious if I wanted to create my stories.</p><p>Nite Stalker is a journey with complex and interesting characters, pulse-pounding action scenes and drama! It has dynamic visual storytelling &amp; a gripping story featuring handsome heroes, beautiful women, and evil villains. Most importantly, this story is for everybody regardless of your political views! As Legendary Filmmaker <strong>Roger Corman</strong> once said ""<i>No preaching just storytelling</i>."" I believe that comics are for everyone and shouldn't pander to one ideology or another.<u> <strong>To be honest, I don't care what your politics are, I just want to put these entertaining comics in your hand and take you on this amazing journey with Javier Rey and the intriguing cast of characters you will soon meet.​</strong></u></p><p> </p><p>Comic books are my passion and we really want to make an impression with the quality of our books.

In March 2018 we debuted Nite Stalker #1 at Wizard World in Cleveland, OH, and SOLD OUT.  Cleveland is a kick@$$ city that adopted me as an artist, a brother, a cousin, an uncle and a son-in-law, the support was out of this world!  I'm a Christian & a military spouse who wholeheartedly supports my beautiful, amazing wife who serves in our United States Air Force. We are blessed with two beautiful daughters to raise and I couldn't be prouder. With Nite Stalker, I'm bringing back the excitement of classic 80's and 90's comics and action movies with the over the top violence of Quentin Tarantino & Robert Rodriquez!  I experienced the Image Revolution when I was in middle school. The Image guys inspired me to pick up a pencil and start taking my art serious if I wanted to create my stories.Nite Stalker is a journey with complex and interesting characters, pulse-pounding action scenes and drama! It has dynamic visual storytelling & a gripping story featuring handsome heroes, beautiful women, and evil villains. Most importantly, this story is for everybody regardless of your political views! As Legendary Filmmaker Roger Corman once said ""No preaching just storytelling.""

As his contact list grew, so did his interest in the  complete field of comic. Starting up a Bad Grrl Comics Fan club in 2001  was the first step to go further then his own living room. Soon  thereafter he began setting up websites for Arthur Suydam, Eric  Basaldua, Broadsword Comics and focussing on titles like Vampirella,  Cavewoman, Hack/Slash and more... He even started working with the FACTS comicon organization where he also met the founder of Broken Frontier and  shortly thereafter began doing headlines for this news site.

His road to creating comic books, though, took several detours. After graduation he had to admit to himself that it would be next to impossible to make a living by drawing comics in Germany, and relocating to the US wasn't really an option, even though at this point his drawing abilities were quite good. So he spent the next 20 years in the dreary profession of a graphics deisgner. It took a pep talk from fan-favorite artist Greg Capullo during a book signing in Frankfurt to get Markus back on track; after being told that in the meantime, the ""bullpens"" at the publishers had ceased to exist: all you needed nowadays to break into comics were talent, a scanner and an internet connection. With newfound enthusiasm, determined to take the comic book world by storm (or, failing that, a gentle breeze), Markus set out to find a partner-in-crime - enter Richard Boom, who was happy to take Markus aboard. Initially (and rather inadvertently) he took on the role of story editor, trying to bring some sort of order and continuity to she sprawling wealth of material that represented the ""Sisterhood"" universe. Hungry to get his teeth into the actual creation of art, he took the script for a 10-page story apart at the seams (with the blessing of original author Viktor Kruithof) and hammered it into a full-length comic book story. These pages will see print as Sisterhood #2 sometime in the spring of 2020, and, as life sometimes comes full-circle, will feature a variant cover by none other than Greg Capullo.</p><p><strong>Renee Rienties</strong>: <strong>Interior artist #2 penciller</strong></p><p>Renee Rienties is an independent comic artist from the Netherlands.                She made her start in the world of comics in 2016 with her smallpress book “My Daily Life Comics” which was received well by her readers online and at comic conventions.                In 2017 her art took a dark turn, from funny cute gag comics to creepy bloody horror. Here she worked on a story in “Oyasumi” A manga collaboration she started with two fellow artists. Where she drew her comic “Distortia”  Her creepy art will leave a chilling impression for you to remember.                In 2018 she worked on a chilling short story in the “Hollandsch Manga” anthology series made by various Dutch artists.                If mystery, thriller and horror are your thing, then you have something to look forward to.

He grew up, became a collector, continued drawing, graduated in fine arts, did fanzines, illustrations, fanarts and countless stories; some that never came to light and others that became RPG among friends.

After graduation he had to admit to himself that it would be next to impossible to make a living by drawing comics in Germany, and relocating to the US wasn't really an option, even though at this point his drawing abilities were quite good. So he spent the next 20 years in the dreary profession of a graphics deisgner. It took a pep talk from fan-favorite artist Greg Capullo during a book signing in Frankfurt to get Markus back on track; after being told that in the meantime, the ""bullpens"" at the publishers had ceased to exist: all you needed nowadays to break into comics were talent, a scanner and an internet connection. With newfound enthusiasm, determined to take the comic book world by storm (or, failing that, a gentle breeze), Markus set out to find a partner-in-crime - enter Richard Boom, who was happy to take Markus aboard. Initially (and rather inadvertently) he took on the role of story editor, trying to bring some sort of order and continuity to she sprawling wealth of material that represented the ""Sisterhood"" universe. Hungry to get his teeth into the actual creation of art, he took the script for a 10-page story apart at the seams (with the blessing of original author Viktor Kruithof) and hammered it into a full-length comic book story. These pages will see print as Sisterhood #2 sometime in the spring of 2020, and, as life sometimes comes full-circle, will feature a variant cover by none other than Greg Capullo.Renee Rienties: Interior artist #2 pencillerRenee Rienties is an independent comic artist from the Netherlands.                She made her start in the world of comics in 2016 with her smallpress book “My Daily Life Comics” which was received well by her readers online and at comic conventions.                In 2017 her art took a dark turn, from funny cute gag comics to creepy bloody horror. Here she worked on a story in “Oyasumi” A manga collaboration she started with two fellow artists. Where she drew her comic “Distortia”  Her creepy art will leave a chilling impression for you to remember.                In 2018 she worked on a chilling short story in the “Hollandsch Manga” anthology series made by various Dutch artists.                If mystery, thriller and horror are your thing, then you have something to look forward to. Right now Renee is working on a new chilling book that will come out end of 2019.               Diego Magno Loiola: Interior artist #1 pencillerDiego loved comics and drew since childhood. He grew up, became a collector, continued drawing, graduated in fine arts, did fanzines, illustrations, fanarts and countless stories; some that never came to light and others that became RPG among friends. Then came Sisterhood, not only the first real job opportunity, but how to give life to someone else's ideas, a bulky, imaginative and rewarding job. Diego continues to draw and collect comics!",11.0,0,"9 Campaigns

<h3>The Basics:</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>My name is Nick Spender and I am a freelance Illustrator who has been working in the Publishing and Advertising Industries for over 30 years. I have worked on Book covers, Ad Campaigns, Posters, Magazine articles, Children's books and numerous non-fiction Historical Graphic Novels. Three years ago I published an Ebook (for Amazon Kindle) about Operation Chastise, from the first unique concepts by Barnes Wallis to the subsequent raids on the dams in 1943. This Ebook has garnered very good reviews and now I want to expand the story to create a viable 'property' that will have a real chance of being printed as a physical book, something many people have asked for. </li>
<li>This campaign is to help me raise enough funds to allow me to work full-time on researching, writing and creating more pages of comic strip and other information pages. Also, if I achieve my funding goal it will allow me to secure the services (paid) of the Official Historian of 617 Squadron Association, Dr. Robert Owen,  and commission Graham Bleathman, a very accomplished 'cutaway' Illustrator, to provide other complementary artwork.</li>
<li>Your contributions (no matter how modest!) will help me create a book , using classic comic strip 1950s/60s techniques and painstaking research,  making a true and accurate portrayal of one of the most famous 'special' Squadrons of World War Two, which  should appeal to all generations.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I'm aiming for and what you get for your money:</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>I'm trying to get at least £4000 to allow me to work full-time on the project, which I calculate will take 3/4 months to complete. That doesn't sound a lot for that amount of time, but luckily my overheads are relatively small, and I certainly expect to contribute more personally.</li>
<li>The funding idea I have may well be as unique (at least for Indiegogo) as the Bouncing Bomb -  first of all I'm looking for 'Page Sponsors' - people who will sponsor a new page of strip artwork, and in return will become the owner/s of the original art, along with a colour print of the completed, coloured and lettered page, mounted and framed. I've done this before for a Dan Dare strip for 'Spaceship Away' (a UK-based fan magazine) and it proved quite successful. I've priced these new pieces of work at  £180 per page, intending to create at least 22 new pages of strip art and adding more design-based pages myself. I also have for sale the original 17 pages of art, which I've posted details of on a FaceBook page -<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/NickSpenderDamBusters/%C2%A0if"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.facebook.com/NickSpenderDamBusters/...</a> you have a few minutes please take a look - I will be post in updates on this page - also you will find details of how I created my pages of art so far.</li>
<li>If I don't reach my funding goal, I will, hopefully, depending on Indiegogo's terms and conditions, be able to return the money! If not, I will be sending out prints of existing arts and copies of the existing ebook - and also donating the money to the RAF Association.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The (hoped for) Impact:</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>I think that this, and many other stories of scientific breakthroughs and personal courage and heroism, are important to pass on to subsequent generations. When I grew up (with a father who served in the RAF during the War)  these events weren't so far away, but as decade follows decade, for new generations they might as well be in The Dark Ages. By using the medium of Comic Strip I hope to be able to remind them of the incredible sacrifices (and cost to all sides) that this war meant. Also, I'm after telling a damn good yarn to the best of my abilities!</li>
<li>If you're in any doubt as to my abilities/track record, please check me out on Amazon Books (Nick Spender), or do a simple picture search on Google (or similar)</li>
<li>This is a project that I believe can really contribute, physically as a printed book, to our understanding of what was, for many generations, a pivotal moment in 20th Century History.</li>
</ul>
</div><div><h3> </h3></div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>No matter if you can't afford to contribute ( I've been in the same position myself!) please just share and spread the word. There's just so much I can do using Social Media ( I'm old  - I'm sure I've missed out another platform of communication...)</li>
<li>If you're already somebody who visits Indiegogo please use their share tools (whatever that means - did I mention I was old? Well - at least in my mid-50s...)</li>
</ul>
</div><p>And that's all there is to it.</p></div>","The Basics:

Also, if I achieve my funding goal it will allow me to secure the services (paid) of the Official Historian of 617 Squadron Association, Dr. Robert Owen,  and commission Graham Bleathman, a very accomplished 'cutaway' Illustrator, to provide other complementary artwork.
Your contributions (no matter how modest!) will help me create a book , using classic comic strip 1950s/60s techniques and painstaking research,  making a true and accurate portrayal of one of the most famous 'special' Squadrons of World War Two, which  should appeal to all generations.

 

What I'm aiming for and what you get for your money:
 

I'm trying to get at least £4000 to allow me to work full-time on the project, which I calculate will take 3/4 months to complete. That doesn't sound a lot for that amount of time, but luckily my overheads are relatively small, and I certainly expect to contribute more personally.
The funding idea I have may well be as unique (at least for Indiegogo) as the Bouncing Bomb -  first of all I'm looking for 'Page Sponsors' - people who will sponsor a new page of strip artwork, and in return will become the owner/s of the original art, along with a colour print of the completed, coloured and lettered page, mounted and framed. I've done this before for a Dan Dare strip for 'Spaceship Away' (a UK-based fan magazine) and it proved quite successful. I've priced these new pieces of work at  £180 per page, intending to create at least 22 new pages of strip art and adding more design-based pages myself. I also have for sale the original 17 pages of art, which I've posted details of on a FaceBook page -https://www.facebook.com/NickSpenderDamBusters/... you have a few minutes please take a look - I will be post in updates on this page - also you will find details of how I created my pages of art so far.
If I don't reach my funding goal, I will, hopefully, depending on Indiegogo's terms and conditions, be able to return the money! If not, I will be sending out prints of existing arts and copies of the existing ebook - and also donating the money to the RAF Association.


The (hoped for) Impact:
 

I think that this, and many other stories of scientific breakthroughs and personal courage and heroism, are important to pass on to subsequent generations. When I grew up (with a father who served in the RAF during the War)  these events weren't so far away, but as decade follows decade, for new generations they might as well be in The Dark Ages. By using the medium of Comic Strip I hope to be able to remind them of the incredible sacrifices (and cost to all sides) that this war meant. Also, I'm after telling a damn good yarn to the best of my abilities!
If you're in any doubt as to my abilities/track record, please check me out on Amazon Books (Nick Spender), or do a simple picture search on Google (or similar)
This is a project that I believe can really contribute, physically as a printed book, to our understanding of what was, for many generations, a pivotal moment in 20th Century History.

 
Other Ways You Can Help
 

No matter if you can't afford to contribute ( I've been in the same position myself!) please just share and spread the word. There's just so much I can do using Social Media ( I'm old  - I'm sure I've missed out another platform of communication...)
If you're already somebody who visits Indiegogo please use their share tools (whatever that means - did I mention I was old? Well - at least in my mid-50s...)

And that's all there is to it.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>The story so far...</h3>
<p>Two years ago I created a graphic novelisation of 617 Squadron's operation to destroy the  German Dams in World War 2, filling in parts of the  incredible story left out of the famous 1950s film and correcting some long-held mis-conceptions that have gone down in history as fact!</p>
<p>Now I would like to be able to expand the story to other Operations, including their involvement in D Day and the sinking of the Pocket Battleship Tirpitz in Norway, also subsequent famous operations. With more pages of comic strip (and extra 'graphic' pages) the whole project becomes much more viable as a 'real' printed book,  something many readers of the ebook have been asking for. Now, with the planned revival of this famous Squadron due in 2017, I am also hoping to bring the story up to date (including the Post-War/Cold War days of the 50s and 60s) to make my book as complete as I can, for all ages to enjoy.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>T<strong>he Proposal...</strong>
</h3>
<p>I'm now looking for 'Sponsors' for the new pages to be produced - in essence, that means anybody who pledges a certain amount of money will, firstly, receive the ORIGINAL line art, along with a colour print of the finished, lettered art, framed and signed. Also, the art  that has already been drawn is available, in the same format, to other sponsors who pledge slightly less. With enough financial backing I will be able to do research (including engaging the services of 617 Squadron's Official Historian, Robert Owen) and create new pages. This will also be a group effort - I plan on having a classic cut-away illustration of the new Lightning 2 aircraft that 617 Squadron will be using - and am happy to say that Graham Bleathman, who has done various illustrations for Dan Dare, Gerry Anderson and Haynes Manuals, has agreed to provide art.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Goal...</h3>
<p>...is to be able to produce enough pages that can then be either A: sold as a completed project to an established Publisher or B: to independently publish a finished book.</p>

</div><p> </p></div>","Stop Smat!
Your nightmare incarnate, the first ever hour-long show from Smat (Seattle sketch comedians Sarah McKinley and Matt Olson) will be November 5th and 18th at The Pocket Theater... unless we stop them!

We cannot allow such a self-indulgent, crass mockery of comedy to exist.
They claim to be ""artists"", but like anybody they can be bought.
You will be on the ground floor of a grass-roots revolution to preserve comedy.


 
Goals
The following checkpoints have been negotiated with Smat.

$50 - Smat will provide radishes for you to spitefully throw at them during both shows.
$100 - Smat will concede 15 minutes of stage time during each show to respectable performers.
$500 - Smat will soak their jeans in water onstage and perform the show in wet jeans.
$1,000 - Smat will concede 30 minutes of stage time during each show to respectable performers.
$1,500 - ????
$2,000 - Smat will concede 45 minutes of stage time during each show to respectable performers.
$2,500 - Smat will perform the entirety of each show on their knees.
$2,750 - Smat will perform each show 24 hours sleep deprived.
$3,000 - Smat will cancel both shows and throw a party in the theater each night instead. Smat will not be allowed to attend either party, only bartend.


Stretch Goals!
 

$10,000 - Sarah and Matt do not believe in marriage. They will marry each other on stage, and begin the divorce process immediately.
$20,000 - Matt will fly in his parents from San Jose for the wedding. They will not be amused.
$35,000 - Sarah and Matt will meet with a priest prior to the ceremony to confirm their love before God.
$50,000 - Sarah and Matt will tattoo each other's names on themselves, then tattoo them crossed out.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p> I am a 27 year old art school graduate, and I along with an amazing team are currently working on an upcoming Manga called ""The Boy And The Island"". Before I decided to be a fool and pursue my dream of creating a Manga, I worked as the lead 3D animator for 2 years at a mid-level oil company, and before that I worked in their warehouse department for 6-7 years. The oil industry was never my dream career choice, the thing I loved doing the most ever since my high school years to present was creating stories....inside my head. I have had fears and doubts stop me from actually placing my stories onto sheets of paper for years and years, but this time around it's different. Today I have a team of very enthusiastic local artists, cosplayers, bloggers, and family on my side, not to mention the support of my  6 obnoxiously annoying little nephews and one niece.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The Boy And The Island has a life of it's own, it is no longer quietly waiting in my imagination, it is demanding to be told to the world.

<p>As the Guardian of the Land, Sea and Creatures, Kai  is one with nature. When in full control of his power, nature will respond to his every emotion, but due to his youth and inexperience the power within him has a mind of its own, and the land protects him until he’s ready to take on his role. </p>
<p>The story will follow 12 year old Kai and his companions as they explore the mysterious island of Circadia.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The team we have is strong and talented, the only real challenge we got is gathering up the funds to pay for the work. </p>
<p>There is always a risk of failure and a chance that people will find it unoriginal or unappealing, but to not try at all is a failure in itself and the support from many has been so overwhelming that it seems unfair to them to not take the chance.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

<p>It seems as though it's a very good possibility we will not meet our goal, and while that is unfortunate,<strong> please rest assured that this book will go forward no matter what!</strong><br/>All people who have donated and all Patreons will receive a book, 100%. </p>
<p>The only thing that will change if we do not meet our goal is that we are going to have to find a different printer with lower minimum orders, which isn't great because it means the cost per book will likely be higher than what we have been charging for pre-orders.  If we can reach a minimum of $2500 we will be able to keep our current printer and order the minimum which is 250 books. So please continue to donate and help us get at least to our minimum goal!</p>

<p>I'm Jayleen, Aka Gwu, or Marker guru. Jepi is my Twin sister and together we call ourselves Gurukitty! That's where GuruKitty studio's has come from. We always do our own projects but we like to promote ourselves together. We are 2 parts of a whole, we tend to fill in the blanks for each other and we act as editors and sounding boards for our projects. We also argue a lot! What a perfect recipe to create a couple of Crazy Cat Ladies!</p>
<p>I went to Vancouver Film school for Classical Animation in 2005 and worked for a few years in the animation industry however my passion was always to tell my own stories and make comics and my interest did not include 3d animation or flash animation and I decided to pursue comics. for the past 11 years we have been selling our comics at various conventions in Canada and this is where we found our community. Lovely fellow artists who also had a passion for telling their stories and being kinda weird.</p>
<p>Hello, Albertosaurus was ambitious from the get go. Doing a full colour comic I knew it would be expensive to print. It received so much  support as a web comic I hope it wont be an issue to meet this goal.</p>

</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>the goal of $4200 is  to print with all the bells and whistles that I'd like to have.</p>
<ul>
<li>Perfect bound, soft cover</li>
<li>6""x6""</li>
<li>roughly 108 pages (more bonus pages if we pass our goal)</li>
<li>14pt cover - matte with Spot gloss</li>
<li>French flaps (fold over flaps on the ends of the covers)</li>
<li>105lbs matte internal pages, full colour</li>
<li>500 copies.</li>
<li>Our quote for that is $3700.00</li>
<li>Indiegogo takes 5% + $25 for canadian as fees (Roughly $200 of $4000 that we need) so I've had to calculate that in.</li>
<li>The remaining $300 we would like to use to get extra comics, cover any incidental additional costs (change of exchange rate from now to printing being a bit of a concern) and a bit of an advertising budget. Another unknown fee is the cost to ship the books from the shipping docks to our studio.</li>
<li>This will also cover sending some books to some of the locations in the comic like the Royal Tyrell Museum and other locations seen in the comic to try to get some whole sale purchases and get this comic into stores! </li>
<li>
<strong>*New*</strong> All supporters will be added as a thank you in the book! all of you helped and I appreciate you ALL</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Special Note: As part of this campaign i'm hoping for your input on the perks! The stickers and Dino cards I would love to be dinosaurs that you, our supporters, like the best! in this way I hope that this helps to really make these perks special for Indiegogo.</strong></p>
<p>The campaign ends this year, however there is a long process of printing and shipping to contend with. My goal is to have this print copy available at <a href=""http://www.vancaf.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Vancaf</a> the following year (May 2019) which is why I've said the end date if February. Everything should be ready by then to keep my anxious brain from self destructing!</p>
<p>We've chosen flexible funding because even if we don't get full funding, I need to print the copies I've promised to supporters through the creation journey, family and of course our beloved <a href=""https://www.patreon.com/gurukitty"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Patrons over on Patreon</a>. One way or another this thing is getting printed. </p>
<p>We've previously funded 3 other books on Indiegogo so this is a trusted platform for us.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1527368877/eiudbxghmapc9sqemxos.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>I'll be happy as a pig in slop if we just meet our goal, but if we exceed our goal there a a few things</p>
<ul>
<li>If we exceed by $200 we will add in an embroidered patch of an Albertosaurus into every donation at all reward tier levels</li>
<li>$5200.00 A hardcover book - So far we've only really considered paperback, but it would look super sharp as a hard cover. If we exceeded our goal by $1000 we could upgrade all copies to hardcover</li>
</ul>
<h3>Plan &amp; Supporter interaction!</h3>
<p>We have a plan! while the campaign is going on I'll be working on a number of things. Here is my ""to do"" list of sorts, and some ways you can have some fun with it too!</p>
<ul>
<li>Redoing some pages from the comic. (These will be print exclusive, I will not be updating the online comics)</li>
<li>Making the chapter title pages (again, print only)</li>
<li>Designing the stickers, enamel pins, etc for the Indiegogo campaign. <ul><li><strong>Ideally I'd like you, our supporters to offer feedback in the comments to help me make these perks be what YOU want. Please tell me your favourite dinosaurs for the stickers and card packs! even if they don't make it into the perk, I'll post the art here!</strong></li></ul>
</li>
<li>I'll be getting help from my sister to format the book for print, she will be working on the interior pages for me while I work on all this art (I better let her know this...) </li>
<li>I'll be creating bonus pages in case we get some additional funding to add content to the print</li>
<li>Creating the digital library and digital comics</li>
<li>Re-lettering the whole comic to a consistent look</li>
</ul>
<p>I have a LOT to do however I am confident I can manage it! I wont let a Decade of work stop now!</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1526251663/via8rxl6xse83nwbjixe.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p>Oh boy, I've promised copies to a lot of people. The risk of not funding is having to find an alternative source to fund printing the comics I've at least promised (Patrons, previous contributors, family). It would be upsetting to not have my final copy come together however I am determined. I'm confident that if I don't reach my goal I will at least get enough to meet the minimum order at our printer.</p>

</div></div>","It seems as though it's a very good possibility we will not meet our goal, and while that is unfortunate, please rest assured that this book will go forward no matter what!All people who have donated and all Patreons will receive a book, 100%. 
The only thing that will change if we do not meet our goal is that we are going to have to find a different printer with lower minimum orders, which isn't great because it means the cost per book will likely be higher than what we have been charging for pre-orders.  If we can reach a minimum of $2500 we will be able to keep our current printer and order the minimum which is 250 books. So please continue to donate and help us get at least to our minimum goal!
Thank you so much to all our current backers and patreons who have made everything we do possible! 
 

10 years ago armed with a new notebook, a backpack and a mobi-cool cooler stocked with bottles of coke Jepi, Gwu and Daddy set off on a trip that would be the start of an adventure of Dino proportions! 

I'm Jayleen, Aka Gwu, or Marker guru. Jepi is my Twin sister and together we call ourselves Gurukitty! That's where GuruKitty studio's has come from. We always do our own projects but we like to promote ourselves together. We are 2 parts of a whole, we tend to fill in the blanks for each other and we act as editors and sounding boards for our projects. We also argue a lot! What a perfect recipe to create a couple of Crazy Cat Ladies!
I went to Vancouver Film school for Classical Animation in 2005 and worked for a few years in the animation industry however my passion was always to tell my own stories and make comics and my interest did not include 3d animation or flash animation and I decided to pursue comics. for the past 11 years we have been selling our comics at various conventions in Canada and this is where we found our community. Lovely fellow artists who also had a passion for telling their stories and being kinda weird.
Hello, Albertosaurus was ambitious from the get go. Doing a full colour comic I knew it would be expensive to print. It received so much  support as a web comic I hope it wont be an issue to meet this goal.


What We Need & What You Get
the goal of $4200 is  to print with all the bells and whistles that I'd like to have.

Perfect bound, soft cover
6""x6""
roughly 108 pages (more bonus pages if we pass our goal)
14pt cover - matte with Spot gloss
French flaps (fold over flaps on the ends of the covers)
105lbs matte internal pages, full colour
500 copies.
Our quote for that is $3700.00
Indiegogo takes 5% + $25 for canadian as fees (Roughly $200 of $4000 that we need) so I've had to calculate that in.
The remaining $300 we would like to use to get extra comics, cover any incidental additional costs (change of exchange rate from now to printing being a bit of a concern) and a bit of an advertising budget. Another unknown fee is the cost to ship the books from the shipping docks to our studio.
This will also cover sending some books to some of the locations in the comic like the Royal Tyrell Museum and other locations seen in the comic to try to get some whole sale purchases and get this comic into stores! 

*New* All supporters will be added as a thank you in the book! all of you helped and I appreciate you ALL

Special Note: As part of this campaign i'm hoping for your input on the perks! The stickers and Dino cards I would love to be dinosaurs that you, our supporters, like the best! in this way I hope that this helps to really make these perks special for Indiegogo.
The campaign ends this year, however there is a long process of printing and shipping to contend with. My goal is to have this print copy available at Vancaf the following year (May 2019) which is why I've said the end date if February. Everything should be ready by then to keep my anxious brain from self destructing!
We've chosen flexible funding because even if we don't get full funding, I need to print the copies I've promised to supporters through the creation journey, family and of course our beloved Patrons over on Patreon. One way or another this thing is getting printed. 
We've previously funded 3 other books on Indiegogo so this is a trusted platform for us.

I'll be happy as a pig in slop if we just meet our goal, but if we exceed our goal there a a few things

If we exceed by $200 we will add in an embroidered patch of an Albertosaurus into every donation at all reward tier levels
$5200.00 A hardcover book - So far we've only really considered paperback, but it would look super sharp as a hard cover. If we exceeded our goal by $1000 we could upgrade all copies to hardcover

Plan & Supporter interaction!
We have a plan! while the campaign is going on I'll be working on a number of things. Here is my ""to do"" list of sorts, and some ways you can have some fun with it too!

Redoing some pages from the comic. (These will be print exclusive, I will not be updating the online comics)
Making the chapter title pages (again, print only)
Designing the stickers, enamel pins, etc for the Indiegogo campaign. Ideally I'd like you, our supporters to offer feedback in the comments to help me make these perks be what YOU want. Please tell me your favourite dinosaurs for the stickers and card packs! even if they don't make it into the perk, I'll post the art here!

I'll be getting help from my sister to format the book for print, she will be working on the interior pages for me while I work on all this art (I better let her know this...) 
I'll be creating bonus pages in case we get some additional funding to add content to the print
Creating the digital library and digital comics
Re-lettering the whole comic to a consistent look

I have a LOT to do however I am confident I can manage it! I wont let a Decade of work stop now!



Oh boy, I've promised copies to a lot of people. The risk of not funding is having to find an alternative source to fund printing the comics I've at least promised (Patrons, previous contributors, family). It would be upsetting to not have my final copy come together however I am determined. I'm confident that if I don't reach my goal I will at least get enough to meet the minimum order at our printer.
If we are less than $1000 from our goal I can still print without the spot gloss, french flaps and maybe a lighter paper weight.
If we don't I'll have to look into alternative printers and get a smaller run done. It wouldn't be ideal but I didn't work on this for a decade to give up now!

<p>SAVAGE SASQUANAUT #1 (of 6) is a rocket fueled sci-fi action adventure comic about the  legendary bigfoot carving a path of chaos across the galaxy.  Join him as he high jacks a starship from the largest intergalactic super power, the Aurellian Empire, and that's after he organized a prison break with the outlandish new friends to escape the clutches of a maniacal Empress all in the hope to find a way back to Earth.</p>
<p>The entire series can be described as a mashup of STAR TREK and BUCK ROGERS starring Jack Burton from BIG TROUBLE IN LITTLE CHINA as bigfoot.  That's Sasquanaut in a very  broad nutshell.  </p>
<p>The first issue is 100% completed and ready to go to print, and to further prove how invested I am in Sasquanaut, the scripts were written and Gab has already completed penciling and inking issues 2-6. </p>
<p>This is campaign is to raise funds for the production of the 24 page first issue of the series and help launch a new aspect of my career that will allow me to focus more on creating my own work and less on freelance work-for-hire gigs that place other people's dreams and endeavors before my own. As mentioned above the Kickstarter was successful and I hope to have Indiegogo unlock and expand the issue for the enjoyment and benefit of all backers here and on KS.</p>

<p>Wes says:</p>
<p><i>""I stumbled across an EP of a band I had never heard of, with a picture of a gorilla in a space suit on the cover and the title of the record read Sasquanaut I did two things: I laughed my butt off and then started a search. I scoured the internet for month for a story, a comic, a novel, cartoon, game, ANYTHING about bigfoot in space because that idea excited me in a way like Star Wars and X-Men did for me as a kid. I needed to read, no to EXPERIENCE this story. But I couldn't find it anywhere and I was bummed about it. That is until I FINALLY realized (slower than I'd like to admit) that this was the comic I've been born to create! Somebody needs to tell the story of bigfoot in space. The ultimate outcast, hunted his whole life in the forests of Earth now finds himself lost in space, that's too rich of an idea to pass up. </i></p>
<p><i>I've spent most of my youth growing up living in the worlds others have created because as a kid who often felt out of place, comics like the X-Men really resonated, Elric of Melnibone was transformative, Star Trek was this utopia where everyone belonged, and Star Wars was just cool.  Even with all the powers, costumes, strange worlds and settings the characters and emotions always struck a chord with me in ways non genre fiction never has and when I felt alone these stories helped me connect and understand that there were others out there like me. </i></p>

</div><p> </p></div>","SAVAGE SASQUANAUT #1 (of 6) is a rocket fueled sci-fi action adventure comic about the  legendary bigfoot carving a path of chaos across the galaxy.  Join him as he high jacks a starship from the largest intergalactic super power, the Aurellian Empire, and that's after he organized a prison break with the outlandish new friends to escape the clutches of a maniacal Empress all in the hope to find a way back to Earth.
The entire series can be described as a mashup of STAR TREK and BUCK ROGERS starring Jack Burton from BIG TROUBLE IN LITTLE CHINA as bigfoot.  That's Sasquanaut in a very  broad nutshell.  
The first issue is 100% completed and ready to go to print, and to further prove how invested I am in Sasquanaut, the scripts were written and Gab has already completed penciling and inking issues 2-6. 
This is campaign is to raise funds for the production of the 24 page first issue of the series and help launch a new aspect of my career that will allow me to focus more on creating my own work and less on freelance work-for-hire gigs that place other people's dreams and endeavors before my own. As mentioned above the Kickstarter was successful and I hope to have Indiegogo unlock and expand the issue for the enjoyment and benefit of all backers here and on KS.


I'm Wes Hartman, an award winning comic book colorist, and a small press comic book creator and editor and creator of the Sasquanaut comic. I have spent the last 15+ years working with the biggest and best talent at Marvel, DC, Dark Horse, Aspen, Dynamite, etc. and have had my work featured in TV, film, and video games.  Some of my previous creations and credits include Moon Streak, Sky Sharks, Gears & Bones, Pirates vs. Ninjas, and more.
Gab Santos is an illustrator and concept artist who was born and raised in Manila, Philippines. When digital art was introduced to him in college he realized he wanted to pursue a career in art.  He is fond of making robot designs and mechanical/sci-fi/fantasy/apocalyptic themed illustrations because he enjoys imagining what the future may look like.



SS#1 contains 24 story pages (20% more than Marvel and DC)
All printed copies are in standard American comic size and printed on high-quality glossy paper.
All backers will also receive the Savage Sasquanaut #1 Digital PDF copy
SS#1 has 3 limited Variant Covers available.
SS#1 also includes an Indiegogo Exclusive Variant Cover
There is also an extremely limited ARTIST EDITION where the entire issue will be printed in the original black and white line art (no coloring) for the true art aficionados. 
4""x 6"" mini-prints/postcards
Higher pledge levels include collectible hard enamel pins
Cover A is the first of a 6 part collectible cover mega poster image





The above is a look at the INDIEGOGO EXCLUSIVE VARIANT COVER by the phenomenally skilled Alessandro Michelli and myself on colors.

Check out the awesome HARD ENAMEL PIN based from a cover by KELSEY SHANNON.

This is the the set of 5 mini print postcards that are available with art from Gab Santos, Tyler Kirkham, Paolo Pantalena, Ace Continuado, and Austin Rogers!

This is the UNLOCKED stretch goal BONUS postcard that every backer who purchases any tier with that includes a book(s) will get this card absolutely free!

This is a locked stretch goal for another BONUS PRINT, with your help we can unlock it!

A locked stretch goal that adds 4 more pages to the issue, including the origin story with art by superstar artist Tyler Kirkham. With your help we can unlock and add these pages into the book.

Wes says:
""I stumbled across an EP of a band I had never heard of, with a picture of a gorilla in a space suit on the cover and the title of the record read Sasquanaut I did two things: I laughed my butt off and then started a search. I scoured the internet for month for a story, a comic, a novel, cartoon, game, ANYTHING about bigfoot in space because that idea excited me in a way like Star Wars and X-Men did for me as a kid. I needed to read, no to EXPERIENCE this story. But I couldn't find it anywhere and I was bummed about it. That is until I FINALLY realized (slower than I'd like to admit) that this was the comic I've been born to create! Somebody needs to tell the story of bigfoot in space. The ultimate outcast, hunted his whole life in the forests of Earth now finds himself lost in space, that's too rich of an idea to pass up. 
I've spent most of my youth growing up living in the worlds others have created because as a kid who often felt out of place, comics like the X-Men really resonated, Elric of Melnibone was transformative, Star Trek was this utopia where everyone belonged, and Star Wars was just cool.  Even with all the powers, costumes, strange worlds and settings the characters and emotions always struck a chord with me in ways non genre fiction never has and when I felt alone these stories helped me connect and understand that there were others out there like me. 
Now I think this zany tale of bigfoot lost in space can provide for others, as well as myself, an immense universe full of limitless potential for joy and exciting and fun stories like all those that I have always have and still enjoy.""

This project has been nearly 10 years in the making for me. There have been numerous ups and downs, stops and starts, and most every problem you can imagine has been encountered over the years. Most recently I have successfully been funded via Kickstarter and all my basic costs have been met, and I am now reaching out to Indiegogo to reach an audience as far and wide as possible for the ""best comic you've never read"" and providing a little extra awesome for the dedicated Indiegogo audience!

I want make clear that issue 1 is 100% completed and ready to print, and issues 2-6 of Sasquanaut have been scripted, pencilled, and inked and are awaiting coloring and lettering to be wrapped up.  



""This is a great new unique idea and it’s executed extremely well. I like the writing with the story & plot development, pacing and characterisation alongside this really killer comic style interiors. I would check out their kickstarter and then pledge if you can because I know I’d like to see this come to life."" READING WITH A FLIGHTRING  full review here

<p><strong>Where it all began</strong> ...</p>
<p>This adventure started many years ago, while growing up in the small town of Utopia, Texas. In second grade I discovered my love of drawing when my teacher gave me an old, 1940s book about drawing cartoons. That book set the course for years of drawing at home and doodling in the margins of my assignments at school. My world turned green forever when I found the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Growing up with the cartoon, my mind began to race with characters and stories of my own. I dreamed of someday putting pencil to paper to share my  imagination with others.  It feels like I’ve stepped into a time machine. It might be 30 years later, but this is only the beginning! </p>

Featuring more than 1,500 pages of classic Dreadstar action over three volumes, each page has been meticulously remastered by Jim Starlin himself, making this the definitive Dreadstar collection. The three-volume hardcover Omnibus Collection will gather the complete Dreadstar stories by cosmic master Jim Starlin. Volume 1 is a 512-page collection of Dreadstar’s journey, from the original Metamorphosis Odyssey presented in Epic Illustrated magazine, to the Dreadstar Graphic Novel, The Price graphic novel, the Epic Illustrated short story, and the first eight issues of the original standalone Dreadstar comic series. As an exclusive bonus, Jim Starlin’s Dreadstar Omnibus Volume 1 also features the original painted Metamorphosis Odyssey Portfolio, as well as a four-page bonus story, The Prayer. Whether you’re a longtime Dreadstar fan, or this is your first introduction to the acclaimed series, this volume is a massive, must-own masterpiece. Dreadstar is the comos-spanning tale of Vanth Dreadstar, a powerful warrior and the lone survivor of the Milky Way Galaxy. Joined by his crewmates Oedi, Syzygy Darklock, Willow, and Skeevo, the team finds themselves in the middle of an ancient stalemate war between two forces of evil: The Church of Instrumentality, led by the all-powerful and misguided Lord Papal, and The Monarchy. Near frozen and left for dead after the brutal slaying of his parents, Vanth Dreadstar is saved by the Sword of Power, giving him newfound might and abilities. With sword in hand, he travels the galaxy on a quest for revenge, but what he finds is much, much more.Derived from an experimental race of cat people at the hands of The Church of Instrumentality, Oedi joins Vanth on his journey after an epic war destroys his people.A blind telepath, Willow can not only influence sentient minds, but has the power to affect the minds of cybernetics and computers as well.

Lovecraft's Dreamlands and thought...""I wish this was funnier and gorier""?Are you excited by stories that keep you on your toes and make you question the very fabric of reality?Then you are going to love Ichabod Jones Monster Hunter. Ichabod comes from a deep, almost primordial, place in my soul. It's the part that devours movies like In the Mouth of Madness, Event Horizon, and Jacob's Ladder, while still binging on Gravity Falls, Frankenweenie, and Army of Darkness. It's the part that read Johnny the Homicidal Maniac and laughed hysterically at every gruesome scene.All of that went into Ichabod Jones Monster Hunter, which is what has made it my most beloved property, and for the first time since it released in 2014...there is another full arc written and drawn by the original creative team!That's right. Renzo Podesta is back on art for the second arc. Renzo brings so much to the look of the book, and turns Ichabod from a creepy person into a lovable character...who is also a bit creepy.We're now ready to release the second volume of Ichabod Jones: Monster Hunter, a 96-page hardcover. That's right. HARDCOVER. What is the story about, really?Ichabod isn't about some mental patient who's ruthlessly killing people. It's about a broken man, who was cast off by society, and whether that person, a person who nobody wants, can be a hero.Can he find his place in the world? Can he come to terms with everything that he's done? Can he become a hero?I'm very interested in that idea, as a person who is severely broken myself. I've had depression and anxiety for as long as I can remember, and it's getting worse with every passing year.I never felt like I fit in for the first 30 years of my life. It wasn't until I went out into the world and became the hero of my own story that I started to think that maybe I wasn't the worst human being on the planet.Ichabod, though, came from a place where I was very much alone, broken, and wondering if it would ever get better.I think what makes Ichabod really special is that is was started by a person who never knew if he could be fixed, one who felt like he was cast off from society, and now it's being written by a person who understands that the broken bits are what make him special.See, Ichabod, at its core, is about hope. It's about taking what's special about you and using it to bring light into the world; of shining hope in a bleak universe. Ichabod's world is harrowing and awful, but Ichabod can bring light into it, not despite of being broken, but because of it.A psychological mind screwIchabod Jones is about a psychopath that escapes from a mental asylum and becomes a monster hunter during the Apocalypse, but he doesn't know if he's killing monsters, humans, or it's all in his head the whole time.Ichabod has been imprisoned in a mental asylum for crimes he definitely committed. When he was arrested, the police found him wrist-deep in the guts of his latest victim.While he's never claimed he was innocent, he says he only committed atrocious acts because an authoritative, and unwelcome, voice in his head told him he was doing God's work.He tried to say no to the voice, but it was very insistent and persuasive. It told Ichabod that the people he was killing were monsters and he was saving the world by murdering them.He was wrong...or so he thought.At the beginning of the story, Ichabod wakes up in the Apocalypse, being chased by a monster trying to devour his soul. He has no choice but to use his training as a monster hunter to fight off the beast, and accept his fate as the savior of the world.He meets a band of other inmates, helps them escape the asylum, and they begin their long journey across the desert to freedom, trying to carve out a bit of humanity as they go.Something strange happens to Ichabod throughout the story, and I say strange in a tale that is already at 11 on the strange meter.Every now and then...he snaps back to another place, where he's sitting with his doctor, talking out what just happened to him, or on the run from the law, and definitely NOT in the Apocalypse.Is he really there, is it a memory, or is he having a psychological break?It's that juxtaposition between reality and perception that makes Ichabod special. It's not just an Apocalypse story, or a dark fantasy tale, or a chosen one book. It also messing with your very perception of the universe, and whether Ichabod is truly a hero, or a psychopath killing the innocent.After all, he was wrong about being a savior once, and that's what got him locked away in the first place. What's to say he's not wrong again, only now he's having a much more vivid hallucination?Or perhaps he's only fantasizing about being a hero, while being locked in his cell, unable to smell freedom ever again.The second arc breaks the story open into a fantastical world full of even more magic and monsters, including his meeting the first wizard of the Apocalypse, Necromonica, huge sand scorpions, nightmare elves, inferini, and much more. The first arc hinted at the huge world of Ichabod Jones: Monster Hunter, and the second arc smacks you full force into it. What other people are saying about IchabodWe've gotten some great reviews over the years. If you’ve got a taste for unconventional and offbeat horror, then don’t miss Ichabod Jones: Monster Hunter!"" – Bryant Dillon, President: Fanbase Presshttps://fanbasepress.com/index.php/blogs/bryant-dillon/item/1072-ichabod-jones-monster-hunter-review""Ichabod Jones: Monster Hunter – is a glimpse into the abyss.

<h3>About me and Herman Hedning</h3>
<p>I've been drawing all my life - but the earliest evidence of any kind of specialisation is a short comic strip about two vehicles colliding – made at the age of seven.</p>

<p>In 1986 I start working as a professional cartoonist  on ""91:an"", at one of Swedens two major comic publishers and in 1988 I give birth to <strong>""Herman Hedning""</strong>, published in every issue of the ""Phantom"", Swedens 2nd largest comic magazine at the time.</p>
<p>Herman Hedning quickly became very popular and since 1998 I've had my own magazine and we have published 145 issues so far. There is also and about 30 comic books published.</p>

<h3>But there is more to life than comics</h3>

<p>The original painting is probably the largest form of art I've ever done – in size that is.

</div></div>","About me and Herman Hedning
I've been drawing all my life - but the earliest evidence of any kind of specialisation is a short comic strip about two vehicles colliding – made at the age of seven.

In 1986 I start working as a professional cartoonist  on ""91:an"", at one of Swedens two major comic publishers and in 1988 I give birth to ""Herman Hedning"", published in every issue of the ""Phantom"", Swedens 2nd largest comic magazine at the time.
Herman Hedning quickly became very popular and since 1998 I've had my own magazine and we have published 145 issues so far. There is also and about 30 comic books published.

In 2016 I published a book by myself for the first time, with the glorious help from my readers and crowdfunding. I went really well, and the second book in this series will be coming this spring. Here's that campaign: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1158823709/herman-hedning-1988-1995-prekampbrium


But there is more to life than comics
Although I love writing and drawing comics, I also have an obsession with creating other products with Herman Hedning. There are T-shirts and posters of course, but also plastic figurines, a beer opener and last but not least – a beer brand (but you can only get those in Sweden)! You can take a peek here: http://hermanhedning.indiestry.se/en/

<h3><strong>Bref résumé</strong></h3>
<p>Depuis une dizaine d’année, nous sommes engagés avec notre agence Zhu Culture dans  la promotion et le développement du secteur culturel africain à travers différentes activités dans les disciplines de la musique, du Théâtre, de la mode, des Arts plastiques et aussi dans le domaine de la formation aux métiers du spectacle vivant.</p>
<p>En 2009 Zhu Culture a ajouté une corde à son arc avec l’édition de livres, en publiant un premier ouvrage sur la sonorisation de spectacle et dont le Tome 2 est récemment paru en Mars 2016.</p>
<p>Grâce à la créativité de Saintrick, l’auteur/scénariste des ''Aventures de Pygmoi &amp; Pygtoi'' et le talent de l’illustrateur Rhys, nous avons trouvé l’occasion de nous lancer dans le secteur de la bande dessinée.</p>
<p>‘’Les aventures de Pygmoi &amp; Pygtoi’’ représentent pour nous un projet très ambitieux car traitant de sujets cruciaux pour l’avenir de notre planète. Et la bande dessinée demeure un  formidable vecteur de partage d’idées. Nous espérons vivement, que ce projet s’inscrira dans  le long terme.</p>
<p>Tout en représentant clairement l’expression de nos valeurs vis à vis du développement de notre continent, de la préservation de la nature et de l’éducation, ‘’Les aventures de Pygmoi &amp; Pygtoi’’ sont pour nous, un projet fiable et pertinent d’un point de vue artistique et économique.</p>
<p>Nous accompagner dans le lancement de cette bande dessinée, c’est nous permettre de proposer au monde entier une œuvre artistique de qualité, une œuvre pertinente dans ses thématiques, et enfin et tout simplement, une œuvre à fort impact culturel et économique.</p>

</ol>
</li></ul>
<p>Ces 5.000 premiers exemplaires seront mis en vente en ligne et dans les réseaux partenaires de librairies physiques, en Afrique, Europe et Amérique du Nord.

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Billy Boy #1 &amp; #2 were completed years ago and #3 was started and never completed. The sketches for Billy Boy #3 have been started. Kickstarter funding is needed for:</p>
<p>1. The time to complete 32 pages of comic book art. I can do roughly a page a day, drawing and adding graytones if I can work undisturbed. I will post the page progress as I do them.</p>
<p>2. I also need the raise the funding to print the comics. I'd like to do a run of a few hundred so I can match a Billy Boy #3 with the rest of the Billy Boy #1s and 2s soI can sell them as a set at conventions after the KS is complete. After that I have a new series called BILLY BOY COMIX AND STORIES #1 (which I'd also like to Kickstart).</p>
<p>3. Promotion. Billy Boy #3 will need some promotion though facebook and google ads.</p>
<p>4. Conventions and store signings. Some of the funds raised will be used for travel expenses to do a convention and comic book store signing tour.</p>
<p>5. Storage. Funds needed to store the books so my house isn't overrun by comic book boxes.</p>
<p>6. Web Comic. Funds needed to help fund the new Billy Boy web comic.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Funding Billy Boy #3 will help make an impact on Indy comics.  I will be able to distribute this comic to various comic stores and finally be able to sell Billy Boy 1,2 &amp;3 as a set.  My next fundraiser will be for a Billy Boy Trade paperback collecting Billy Boy 1,2,3 and many other stories that haven't seen print.</p>
<ul>
<li>Billy Boy (The Comic)  is valuable to the contributor and to the world because it shows an indy creator can be successful with the help of dedicated fans</li>
<li>I have been moderatELy successful in publishing comics in the 90s and early 2000-s. I had to take a break from comics because my storyboard work in animation and film was very time consuming--no time for comics!! I'm committed to getting back into comics, but I need your help..</li>
<li>If this funding is successful it will allow me to make even more comics.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The art for the book is almost done.  I need about 2 more weeks to finish.  I need the funds for printing, shipping, conventions, marketing and promotion.  I'd like to have Billy Boy #3 for Wondercon and ComicCon 2020.</p>

<li>Printing</li>
<li>Comic Storage</li>

Hi All,
You're helping fund the production of BILLY BOY #3 By Frank Forte.
BILLY BOY is the story of a deranged delusional boy who lives in a fantastical world of monsters, creatures, demons, ghosts and goblins.  His only friend i his little teddy bear ""teddy"" who he carries around with him like a security blanket.  Billy is constantly teased by the other kids and is considered an outcast.  Billy goes off on his own adventures, but soon finds himself in precarious situations.

Billy Boy #1 and #2 were published by Asylum Press in the early 200s.  Billy Boy #3 is almost done!



Frank Forte is an artist, writer and storyboard artist. His credits include: Bob's Burgers, 3 Below (Trollhunters spin-off), Truth or Dare, Insidious:The Last Key, Despicable Me 2, The Emoji Movie, LEGO Guardians of the Galaxy, LEGO Star Wars:The Empire Strikes Out, The Super Hero Squad Show, Heavy Metal Magazine and more. His paintings have been exhibited at La Luz de Jesus Gallery, CASS Contemporary, Copro Gallery and Arch Enemy Arts among others. Frank is also the publisher at Asylum Press (www.asylumpress.com), an indy graphic novel and comic book publisher. Frank's website is: www.frankforte.com.

SAMPLE PAGES FROM BILLY BOY#3
Here are some of the interior pages almost completed

What We Need & What You Get
Billy Boy #1 & #2 were completed years ago and #3 was started and never completed. The sketches for Billy Boy #3 have been started. Kickstarter funding is needed for:
1. The time to complete 32 pages of comic book art. I can do roughly a page a day, drawing and adding graytones if I can work undisturbed. I will post the page progress as I do them.
2. I also need the raise the funding to print the comics. I'd like to do a run of a few hundred so I can match a Billy Boy #3 with the rest of the Billy Boy #1s and 2s soI can sell them as a set at conventions after the KS is complete. After that I have a new series called BILLY BOY COMIX AND STORIES #1 (which I'd also like to Kickstart).
3. Promotion. Billy Boy #3 will need some promotion though facebook and google ads.
4. Conventions and store signings. Some of the funds raised will be used for travel expenses to do a convention and comic book store signing tour.
5. Storage. Funds needed to store the books so my house isn't overrun by comic book boxes.
6. Web Comic. Funds needed to help fund the new Billy Boy web comic.


THE PERKS






The Impact
Funding Billy Boy #3 will help make an impact on Indy comics.  I will be able to distribute this comic to various comic stores and finally be able to sell Billy Boy 1,2 &3 as a set.  My next fundraiser will be for a Billy Boy Trade paperback collecting Billy Boy 1,2,3 and many other stories that haven't seen print.

Billy Boy (The Comic)  is valuable to the contributor and to the world because it shows an indy creator can be successful with the help of dedicated fans
I have been moderatELy successful in publishing comics in the 90s and early 2000-s. I had to take a break from comics because my storyboard work in animation and film was very time consuming--no time for comics!! I'm committed to getting back into comics, but I need your help..
If this funding is successful it will allow me to make even more comics.


Risks & Challenges
The art for the book is almost done.  I need about 2 more weeks to finish.  I need the funds for printing, shipping, conventions, marketing and promotion.  I'd like to have Billy Boy #3 for Wondercon and ComicCon 2020.

<h3>Aztec of the City issue # 5 ''Tales of Tenochtitlan''</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The First Mexican-American superhero...which made its premier on Cinco de Mayo, 1993 at the Fairmont Hotel in San Jose, CA...Returns this summer with a 22 page story about life in Tenochtitlan, years before the Conquest of Mexico by the Spaniards</p>

<p>As a sophomore in high school, I was in charge of the sports page and by my junior year, I was editor in chief of the bi-weekly 12 page San Jose High School Herald newspaper. </p>
<p>We look forward to printing this historic and visually entertainng epic tale about Aztec life before the Conquest with our hopes and continued goal of giving Mexican-American, Latino comic book fans, a hero of their own. </p>

<p>We expect to print 3,000 copies which has been what we have always done in the past with every issue dating back to 1993. All of whom, have all sold out, except for our volume III series, where we still have comic books available of #1, 2, 3 and # 4. </p>

<p>What do superheroes, charities, and calendars have in common?</p>
<p>They’re all things we love at A Place To Hang Your Cape!</p>
<p>AP2HYC is teaming up with the Anti-Bullying Alliance (ABA) to create a calendar to raise funds for this year’s <a href=""http://www.anti-bullyingalliance.org.uk/anti-bullying-week/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Anti-Bullying Week</a>. </p>
<p>The theme of this year's calendar is ""Power For Good"", the same theme as Anti-Bullying Week. </p>
<p>10% of all funds raised will be donated to the ABA. In addition, the calendar will be sold in fundraising events around the world to help raise even more funds and support for the ABA.</p>
<p>The artwork featured in this calendar will be created by some of the world’s smallest heroes – kids! Each page will feature a superheroic self-portrait with each young artist showing off their power for good as well as a reinterpretation by a professional artist.</p>
<p>It wouldn’t be an AP2HYC calendar if it didn’t include our trademark nerdy dates. This year, we’ll be adding in dates of important heroic acts (both real and fictional).</p>
<p>So if you love superheroes and hate bullying, this is the calendar for you!</p>
<h3><strong>Who are AP2HYC &amp; the ABA?</strong></h3>
<p><a href=""https://www.ap2hyc.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">A Place to Hang Your Cape</a> is a superhero and comic book website dedicated to celebrating heroes big and small.

<p>We believe in celebrating heroes in all sizes. Each page of the calendar will feature a new hero, complete with superpowers, created and drawn by some of the world’s youngest artists.</p>
<p>We held a contest for kids (age 16 or under) around the world to submit drawings of themselves as superheroes. 12 winners have been selected and their drawings will be reinterpreted by 12 professional artists, with both images appearing together in the final calendar.</p>

Tact suggests they search in the old abandoned Stewart mansion. That’s because on the way to Kendra’s house, she thought she heard the gurgle of a baby coming from beneath the overcoat of either Miles or Davis, two crafty yet rather inept criminals. Tact watched as they scampered towards the Stewart mansion. Living in this old mansion are three frustrated ghosts. Rosemary Stewart was an accomplished Hollywood actor, singer and dancer. Otto von Auspouf was her choreographer and Brian Germaine was an up-and-coming special effects wizard. All three died in the mansion under mysterious circumstances. They have been trapped in the ghostly state for a half a century. <i>Caretakers</i> is a delightful blend of ghostly spookiness, teenaged shenanigans, slapstick comedy, ballroom dancing and ninjas.

<p><strong><i>Harvard Gardens: Volume One, </i> the first volume in a four volume comic, tells the story of Hailey ""Lee"" Gardens, a young woman who has turned her back on her family and her past. Upon learning of her mother’s death, Lee returns home, hoping to attend the funeral, collect her inheritance, and return to her life; however her plans are thwarted when she is informed that her mother has named her the legal guardian and caregiver of her younger, mentally handicapped brother, Harvard who's disability has left him with the mind of a child. Making matters worse, she forced to contend with her estranged ex-husband, Tom, and Harvard’s devoted caregiver, Clara. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Faced with the challenge of finding the best solution for each of them, Lee concludes that a mental institution is the best option for her brother and despite Tom and Clara’s protests, Lee delivers a confused and scared Harvard to the institution upstate. Rid of her responsibilities, Lee is free to resume her life, that is, until a car accident puts her in the hospital. Once awake, Lee realize she isn’t in the hospital, but instead, trapped within the imaginary world her brother has spent a lifetime creating. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Lee soon discovers that her brother, who has vanished, is the only one who can return Lee to her world. What’s worse; a hoard of dark creatures and an unseen force have begun an attack upon her brother’s world, consuming everything in their path. Forced to accompany Harvard’s closest confidant, the slender gentleman Nigel, a brave and icy captain named Agathon and a mysterious young Empress named Invia in their search for Harvard, Lee must find and save her brother while making unlikely connections and facing some of her darkest secrets she had hoped would stay buried.</strong></p>
<p>The story is a dramatic, action packed journey through a bizarre and beautiful world. However, despite being set primarily within Harvard's imaginary world, the story and its main character, Lee, are forced to confront more than just bizarre creatures and monsters. <i>Harvard Gardens</i> addresses real world issues such as childhood abuse and trauma, parental neglect, abandonment, developmental disabilities, LGBT issues and mental health issues. By way of Lee's journey through her brother's imagination, the story examines themes such as the dynamic amongst siblings, the relationships between children and their parents, forgiveness, self sacrifice and ultimately, the inevitable death of innocence all individuals must face.</p>

<p>As I mentioned, the story of Harvard Gardens is my baby. I've birthed it, molded it, resented it, shamefully neglected it at times, scolded myself for not treating it better and ultimately loved it immensely for the last 15 years. And its not just because drawing and story telling are my passions; this project is personal to me because it touches on many subjects that have directed affected my life. It deals with issues that I have struggled to understand and overcome such as depression, mental illness, traumatic childhood events, a dysfunctional home life and abandonment. In many ways, I am both the characters of Lee and Harvard. </p>
<p>Furthering my career and making a name for myself as an illustrator and a storyteller within the comic book and entertainment industries are obviously very important to me but with this project, its more than that.

<p>This comic is the definitive tale about the story behind the deck of cards. The land, once unified under a single banner, has been divided into four territories, each territory ruled by a family. The Diamonds, wealthy and corrupt; the Clubs, strong and resourceful; the Hearts, ambitious, though loyal to a fault; and the Spades, hard and merciless. All of whom desire power about all things.</p>
<p>Centuries of bloodshed have won a tenuous peace between the families. To prevent another war, the Four of a Kind, an order of wise and holy men, have been entrusted to keep the peace at any cost. Each King is watched closely by a member of this conclave. Though, like all things, corruption has inevitably spread through their ranks. The land, yet again, finds itself poised on the edge of total war.</p>
<p>Our story begins with Jack, the Prince of Spades, and heir to the Spade Kingdom. Jack, disregarding the advice of his life-long tutor, David Tell, takes on the responsibilities of Minister of Executions, a position usually followed by ""early retirement"". But Jack is eager to prove himself to his people and, above all, his father, the King. When a certain band of gypsies who call themselves The Euchre begin terrorizing the Spade Kingdom, Jack makes it his personal mission to see their leader on his gallows.</p>

</div></div>","A promise is a promise. But for Michael Langer, his fateful pact with the sorrowful ghosts of his past may just mean his doom.  His childhood home of Heslev Manor in Denmark hides a dark secret... a malevolent force is growing in strength and Michael may be the only one that can stop it.From the wickedly creative minds of writer Lars Kramhøft and artist Tom Kristensen of Denmark comes MADE FLESH, a 124 page, full color graphic novel. The story of Made Flesh is a deviant tour de force of serial killer horror and supernatural terror. It has a uniquely European style that takes the reader away to the Danish countryside and the evils lurking within small town history.  The gritty and raw art style of MADE FLESH underlines the psychological dread of this dark tale. The resulting marriage of text and imagery makes for a viscerally frightening experience that has no equal.Lars Kramhøft and Tom Kristensen are a writer/artist team living and working in Copenhagen.Lars Kramhøft is a writer whose fiction has been published in a number of Danish anthologies. His work has also been featured in such publications as ""The Lovecraft E-zine"" and ""Siren's Call"".Tom Kristensen is a professional illustrator that has worked with a wide array of visual storytelling. He has worked within the realms of natural history and children's books, but his darker side bleeds through in the medium of comics.Made Flesh is Lars and Tom's first in a series of projects together. After self-publishing their work in Denmark, they were bestowed The Danish Horror Award in 2013. Since then they have toured the comic conventions of the world, finally allowing them to find a home for their hideous creation at Evil Jester.We at Evil Jester Comics are giving this project all the love and attention it deserves. Our co-founder and lead editor, Taylor Grant, has been working alongside editor Aric Sundquist, and contributing editors and proofreaders, Erik Zagarello and Briana Onishea, to assure this creepy and horrifying comic is ready to be received by the masses when it releases. INTRODUCTION BY JONATHAN MABERRYJONATHAN MABERRY is a New York Times best-selling and multiple Bram Stoker Award-winning horror and thriller author, editor, comic book writer, magazine feature writer, playwright, content creator and writing teacher/lecturer.

<p><i> “We
all saw Barbara Nice at the Glee Club in Birmingham and thought she was
hilarious. So we googled her and got a link to the Fizzog '50% Funnier Tour'. We’d never heard of them and didn’t know what to expect but we have all
just spent the interval tweeting furiously about the show because we loved it
so much. It’s really funny. And Jo was thrilled to win the dettol in the
raffle.”</i></p>
<p><i><b>Dan Morrissey, FREE RADIO and friends.</b></i></p>
<p><br/><i>
“We saw the Fizzogs in their Christmas panto at the Black Country Living Museum
and we loved them, which is why we came to the show. It was brilliant. I’m from
Bulgaria and got it completely. Very funny.” </i></p>

Our current offering of <i><b>‘Fifty
Shades of Fizzog’</b></i>, has been an absolute hit, bringing our best characters

<p>2014 was a prolific year with the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftmtXynz5sk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">viral video</a> and our sell out shows across the region.  Our unique brand of Black Country humour has been an absolute hit with audiences from across the globe. </p>

</div></div>","Our Campaign

After our
famous Fizzog Productions ‘Dancing Grannies Video' went viral in July 2014  with 1.6
million shares on Facebook, we are now raising funds to take our new comedy
theatre show, ‘Fifty Shades of Fizzogs'  to the EDINBURGH FRINGE FESTIVAL August 2015 from 7-13 August. And we need your help to do it!
We are a professional Theatre
Company from the Black Country, who specialise in comedy theatre and are
passionate about bringing laughter, fun and frolics to audiences far and wide. We
also work with the Black Country Museum, performing sketches of days gone by,
and promote education through youth theatre. 

QUOTES FROM SHOWS:
 “We
all saw Barbara Nice at the Glee Club in Birmingham and thought she was
hilarious. So we googled her and got a link to the Fizzog '50% Funnier Tour'. We’d never heard of them and didn’t know what to expect but we have all
just spent the interval tweeting furiously about the show because we loved it
so much. It’s really funny. And Jo was thrilled to win the dettol in the
raffle.”
Dan Morrissey, FREE RADIO and friends.

“We saw the Fizzogs in their Christmas panto at the Black Country Living Museum
and we loved them, which is why we came to the show. It was brilliant. I’m from
Bulgaria and got it completely. Very funny.” 
Maria Ollis, Tipton.

Fizzog Productions (www.fizzogproductions.co.uk) has been going from strength to strength for the last 15 years, and have successfully toured the West Midlands with sell-out shows. Our current offering of ‘Fifty
Shades of Fizzog’, has been an absolute hit, bringing our best characters
and Black Country humour to the stage. 
2014 was a prolific year with the viral video and our sell out shows across the region.  Our unique brand of Black Country humour has been an absolute hit with audiences from across the globe. 
With your help and support,  2015 will be even better. We have already raised some funds and your support to raise the remainder, whether it be through funding or spreading the word about our campaign, is very much appreciated and valued.  Please help us make our dream a reality.

 What You Get

Why
do we need your help? We are a
not-for-profit company and generate all of our earnings from shows, educational
workshops and tours. We have already raised some of the funds for Edinburgh,
which has helped us to cover some of the costs. We hope that you can help us
raise the necessary £3,000.00.  
Where
will the £3,000.00 go? It will
go towards paying for Venue Hire, Accommodation, Marketing and Publicity,
photography, tour costs and travel. 
Your Perks
£10 - you will receive a shout out via social media as well as a personal Thank you via our Website. 
£25 - All of the above plus a Fizzog Keyring, Bumper sticker and signed photo.
£50 - All of the above plus a mention in the Edinburgh Fringe show programme and a Limited Edition EXCLUSIVE pair of Dancing Grannies' knickers.
£100 - All of the above plus 2 free tickets to any Fizzog Show within a 12 month period, as well as a personalised recorded message especially for you from the Dancing Grannies. 
£250 - All of the above plus a signed Edinburgh Fringe poster. 2 x VIP tickets to any Fizzog Show within a 12 month period which will include a glass of champagne and nibbles, a shout out on stage from the Fizzogs and an after show meet and greet backstage. 
£500 - All of the above plus Afternoon Tea at a venue of our choice in our beloved Black Country which will include a ""private"" Dancing Grannies dance. 

 The Impact
 
Your support will help us significantly by:


Helping us put the Black Country on the map

humour


Promote women in comedy
 
  
We are already having a global impact; in addition to our
