<p style=""text-align: center;"">The dotts headphones are made of Bioplastics and 100% Eco-friendly materials.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>TPU</strong> (Thermoplastic Polyurethane) is a <strong>environmentally friendly material</strong> that gives strength and flexibility to the dotts M headband and buttons . <strong>Almost unbreakable,</strong> you'll never have to worry about breaking your headphones again.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>PLA</strong> (polylactide) gives the dotts M <strong>resistance and strength</strong> at the same time. Made from 100% renewable resources such as corn starch, chips or sugarcane. It is super amazing, and <strong>comfortable at the same time.</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>But, what is a Bioplastic?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Being biodegradable means that <strong>the industrial process of biodegradation is much quicker than PET plastic (plastic made of petroleum)</strong>. Our materials only require 45-90 days to get the industrial process completed while PET products require an intense, long and also <strong>harmful to the environment</strong> one.</p>

The first of its kind with an amazing ultra-flexible headband made using 3D printing techniques. The dotts M is a meticulously crafted wireless headphone truly made to be as unique as you. An ultime audio experience with all the features you came to expect from a high-end headphone.



 The dotts configurator. We have created the configurator so that you can design your own headphones. Press on the button to visit the dotts M configurator and enjoy designing your new high-end wireless and sustainable headphones.



The dotts headphones are made of high quality materials that come from natural and renewable resources and its production uses 65% less energy than traditional manufacturing. It is a completely upgradable product that allows us to break the paradigm of plastic waste. Scroll down and get to know better why we are the most Eco-Friendly headhpones ever created. 



 

Immerse yourself in a true audio experience. Active Noise Cancellation let you focus on the things that really matter: your music, your videos and your calls. When you activate it every noise that you don't want to hear will be eliminated.
 
The headband is made of a completely flexible and sustainable material with a level of resistance that can withstand the strength of a car without breaking. Always returning to its original position, it comfortably fits all head sizes and it's virtually impossible to break.

With one or two taps you can control your music, calls and activate the voice assistant. Turn volume up and down, take/decline calls, skip songs and much more with your fingerprints.
Of course, technology matters. But to us, it REALLY matters. Having experienced the design of previous audio products, it made us understand what customers are really looking for when buying a wireless headphone. Before starting the development of the dotts headphones we first chose all the features that we would most like to have as headphone's clients. dotts headphones are unique pieces of technology fully engineered by our team that enhances the sound experience, taking it to the next level. 


Every dotts headphone includes a dotts case. With the dotts case you will be able to carry them with you wherever you go. Having a dotts case also means there is no need for extra packaging that we know will only end up in the bin. The dotts case is an exclusive case made with sustainable materials and we are sure that you will love it!
 
We strongly believe that every Wireless headphone should have a very unique sound signature. The dotts M have an accurate sound with a slight boost in the bass and lower midrange. It offers total isolation from all external noise through its innovative noise cancellation mode with no effect on the hi-fi sound, keeping it clean and pure. You will enjoy your music the way it was intended!
The dotts headphones are made of Bioplastics and 100% Eco-friendly materials.
TPU (Thermoplastic Polyurethane) is a environmentally friendly material that gives strength and flexibility to the dotts M headband and buttons . Almost unbreakable, you'll never have to worry about breaking your headphones again.
PLA (polylactide) gives the dotts M resistance and strength at the same time. Made from 100% renewable resources such as corn starch, chips or sugarcane. It is super amazing, and comfortable at the same time.
But, what is a Bioplastic?
Being biodegradable means that the industrial process of biodegradation is much quicker than PET plastic (plastic made of petroleum). Our materials only require 45-90 days to get the industrial process completed while PET products require an intense, long and also harmful to the environment one.

Instead of manufacturing the whole product in China (as most of the brands do) we have an in-house production model. In that way, we are not only avoiding unnecessary transport but we are also controlling the quality and the processes of almost everything we do. The final product is also hand-assembled in our factory in Madrid (Spain). 
dottsaudio is a multidisciplinary team with product design as the main expertise, but with a strong connection with engineering, science and business.  We strongly believe that it's only with a wide approach that we can get a solution that is truly complete.

Any questions?Check our FAQ below or send an email to hey@dottsaudio.com If you still have any doubts then:  When will I be able to choose my color variation?We will email you a survey after the campaign is completed to collect the colours and shape of your dotts M. Please note that if you decide to customise your whole product, the refund policy won't be applicable since it would be a fully customised product. Where can I get help if there is a problem with the product?For any inquiry or problem after receiving the product, our technical support team will be available to attend you at hey@dottsaudio.com or via the Facebook chat above. Once you receive your dotts you will get also our compromise of answering you in less than 24 hours.   Is there any warranty policy?We have a 1 year International warranty policy (please note it may be more than 1 year depending on your local legislation) Which is your return policy?lf you have not yet received your device and it has not yet been shipped, you can email us and receive a full refund (while the ""funding""campaign is active - not ""InDemand"" stage). If the product has been shipped and you have not received it, we can issue a refund. There is a 14 days money back guarantee if you have not used the device and open the package. Shipping and VAT will not be refunded and you are responsible for shipping charges for the return. I have backed your project but I didn't get any confirmation email. How do I check the status of the order?We would recommend you to check your spam folder. If you can'f find it please contact us and we will be more than happy to help you! Can you tell me about volume pricing? I am interested in getting these for my office. Sure! Contact us at hey@dottsaudio.com and a member of dotts audio team will help you with it.  How much is the shipping cost? When will I receive my dotts M?The shipping cost is up to 10 Euros depending on the country. The expected shipping date is by the end of October - November 2018. You will receive a survey once the campaign is finished in order to confirm your shipping address and your requested colours and shape.  How many countries does the dotts M can be shipped to?We ship our dotts M worldwide, with the exception of Saudi Arabia, Peru, Ecuador, Macedonia, Kosovo, Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, North Korea, Syria, and Yemen. Please note that we cannot ship to military locations. Will there be any handling fees and custom charges?Every VAT amount is included in the price so you won't need to pay any extra money. There are no custom charges included. Can my backed product be shipped to different addresses? What happens if I change my address before you ship? All orders on the same account will be shipped to a single address. To send to multiple addresses, multiple orders (under different accounts) are needed. You can save money by sending them to one shipping location. If you wish to do this with multiple orders, please contact us. Also, before we ship your order, you can change the shipping address at any time. Can the headphone be used by cable? Yes, an extra Jack 3.5mm cable is included in the box. There is an auxiliary port located on the back of the right Ear Cup.  How is the comfort level?We have spent a lot of time designing the most comfortable headphone for you. Thanks to 3D printing and the headband fully-flexible material the dotts M is more comfortable than any other headphone you have ever tried. It fits to every head size and shape.  Are the headphones suitable for exercise use?Yes, they are. They are so light and the flexible headband makes it perfect for sports use. We recommend the Over the Ear Oval for sport use, but both of the Over the Ear are perfect. The earpads are also totally interchangeable so it is a good point for sports use! Are the Earpads replaceable? The earpads are completely and easily replaceable. Which voice assistants work with the dotts M?The dotts M work properly with Siri, Google Assistant and Cortana. We are on the process of testing Alexa.  What does it mean that the headphones are upgradeable? The modular design of the dotts M allows us to sell each piece individually which means that you won't need to worry about buying a whole new headphone when you are tired of the color or shape as well as when it gets broken. The upgradeable program will start once the campaign is finished.  Which payment methods do you accept?
If you are contributing via direct credit/debit card we accept Visa, Mastercard, American Express, and Discover Cards.

<p>The idea for the Twinkle Treat Basket came about from a near tragedy while driving home on a dark Halloween night in 2011.  Its creator narrowly missed hitting a trick-or- treating child who was walking on the road side in the dark.  This incident had shaken her so much that it inspired her to create the Twinkle Treat Basket concept. Her design idea would help make treat-or–treating children more visible to drivers.</p>
<p>In December of 2011, as a family we set out to create the first Twinkle Treat Basket. After seeing what Halloween products were on the market we decided to make our own design.  We bought many LED products and toys with sound, pulled them apart and studied how they were made.  With household tools and many trials and errors on our kitchen table, we perfected Twinkle Treat Basket into what you see here and on our website <a href=""http://www.twinkletreatbasket.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.twinkletreatbasket.com</a>. </p>
<p>Twinkle Treat Basket is an interactive candy carrier for Halloween that has motion and vibration-activated lighting and sound displays. This unique design not only enhances the carrier’s costumed appearance but also increases the visibility of the user by making them extremely noticeable to drivers and others during this nighttime event.</p>
<p>Here is the first hand built design that started our journey.<span>  It was rough and<br/>still functions even today on its original lithium watch batteries.</span></p>

<p>We are a very small company and are humbled but also proud to say that we have made a production grade marketable and ready to sell Twinkle Treat Basket. We could write a book on all the challenges we have faced in the past 3 years. We are driven because we believe in what we are doing and will not give up. We have a great group of people that have helped us through concept to reality and we have always found a way to solve issues that arise. Currently, we are building our first orders of Twinkle Treat Basket inventory and as you can imagine this has drained our resources. Although there is minimal time to sell actual units for this Halloween Season, this is the prime time to sell directly to retailers for Halloween 2015. If our funding limitations are met we will have the resources to complete our product safety testing and build our marketing to launch on a much grander scale this coming year. Twinkle Treat Basket technology and design has been tested and is a proven reality. We brought this idea to life and serve a purpose in hopefully saving lives. We hope you like Twinkle Treat Basket as much as we do and can imagine all the shapes, sizes and uses that could be created from our first Pumpkin model. We already have other designs in our heads just waiting to be set free.</p>
<p>When we first set out to market The Twinkle Treat Basket we hired a firm called Marketing Advisory Group out of Las Vegas, NV.  Edward Ayers helped us get focused and create all our first marketing material. We incorporated SOBOBAS, Inc. and sent out our information.  To our excitement and surprise we received many positive responses and two very larger retailers expressed interest, but at that time we had not been able to find a manufacturer for the Twinkle Treat Basket. <br/>After various attempts and failures in January 2014 we reached out to a family friend and he found us a Korean Manufacture that we have built a relationship with. We had some delays but being that we wanted to make a quality product we took time to make sure it was ready for market. At this writing we have finished our product design and moving toward  production.  Our hope is to market for next year and obtain all product certifications needed for importation and sales with a full launch set for Halloween 2015.  Our website <a href=""http://www.twinkletreatbasket.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.twinkletreatbasket.com</a> is up and we will open online sales once we know our first shipment is close to arriving.  Our biggest challenge is marketing, but we have a product that we can easily demonstrate to be profitable on paper.  </p>
<p>With the money we receive our plans were and still are still quite focused.  <br/>Market and attend every trade show we can over the next 8 months to generate orders.  We started with the idea of licensing our and have now become a manufacturer and the sole distributor of the Twinkle Treat Basket in North America.  We came to Indiegogo.com with the hopes that there are people who believe in this product as much as we do.   Along the way we found some wonderful people that were able to help us out.  Thank You for looking at us here on indiegogo.com and anything you can do to help us get notice would be worth more than the funding.   Please help save some lives and avoid senseless tragedies on Halloween.  Since this campaign ended we have been able to launch our website an online store and our looking for our next rendition of the Twinkle Treat Basket. </p>

From The Breeding Ground of Some Of The Most Well-Known Brands in The World like Acer, ASUS, BenQ and GIANT Bikes---Taiwan, Taipei... Comes The Coolest Innovation in 2014 That Will Change The Way You Play Music From Your Smart Gadgets!
Introducing...How It Works?Play The Video Below To Learn MoreHow It All Begins?
From Napkin Concept To An Awesome Reality
We are a small & dynamic Taiwan based product development team who  had helped clients developed numerous products around the world. But we had always wanted to have a “Signature Product Of Our Own"", something that we are really passionate about and  can be proud of.
So when someone fired up a dinner conversation(debate) a year ago about which is the Coolest Wireless Bluetooth Speakers in the market, that conversation quickly lead into a “Geek Out Party!”  where we drafted out a""blueprint"" of what we believe to be…
""The Smart Wireless Speakers Of Our Dream!""
Now, as we are based in Taipei City and like any city dwellers in the world,  we love things that can free up more time and space for us, especially those that comes with human driven design and technology that makes us feel cool and awesome in our fast moving and hectic life.So We Decided To Become BOLD ( Really BOLD!). 
Instead of developing just another speaker, we wanted to create a Fun and Unique User Experience from it.So We Came Out With This...


Little did we know, that this little “Blue Print” on the paper napkin turn out to be the INCUBATION of our long awaited Signature Product of our own----MobiMuse XBand-ONE! We Started To Work Quickly...We called up and meet up with some of the most resourceful individuals and innovative talent we know of. And before we knew it, we gathered some of the best resources and members to Kick Start our MOBIMUSE XBAND-ONE project.







With our ""1st Proof Of Concept"" , we decided to move quickly to the next phase of our project....
The ID Design...
We played with all kind of possibilities. While we do want XBAND-ONE to look cool, we also want to add some Unique Twist with a  bit of Human Touch on it.So when DES, our Australia Trained Designer finally came out ( after countless sleepless night) with an ""Unplug and Deploy"" Concept in a Classic Boom Box design, and added a perfect mix of  Futuristic Yet Minimalist look and feel that looks like this....We All Fell In LOVE ...Right On The Spot!So We Decided To Plunge!We put in every resource we had and JUMP straight into the production of our First CNC Mock Up Sample before anything else!Having our 1st Mock Up Sample at hand,we knew we need a little more preliminary market research to iron out any ""loose ends"" to make sure that XBAND-ONE is ready for the market.So we scheduled to meet up with some potential buyers during the International Hong Kong Electronic Trade Shows. We received some great response, along with some very valuable insights and recommendations from some of the Most Savvy Gadgets Sellers around the world. This is IMPORTANT, Because we know....above our passion, XBand-ONE MUST be a ""Market Driven"" product as well. 

As you can see from the above, MOBIMUSE XBAND-ONE is not just another “Fly By Night” Idea. It is a product developed with a Solid Plan Of Action from a dedicated team of people who stop at Nothing to realize our dream.Your IMPACT!

It's not only an amplifier, but a gratifying home decor, or a device that allows you to use you speakers anywhere, including a lovely lawn under the sun. Many of the amplifiers in the current market need wired power supply, so they can't be away from cables and electrical outlets. Besides, they usually come with high price. In order to create enjoyable amplifiers that are accessible and user-friendly to all, we wanted to combine a small size, a stylish appearance, long-lasting built-in battery, bluetooth connectivity and high definition quality into our very creation. Bring your favorite speakers to life!Bluetooth speakers and amplifiers are getting common nowadays. However, our favorite speakers of all time are the old ones we bought 20 years ago. We haven't used it for quite some time, but they have been the best company of ours for more than ten years. Eventually, we decided to make an amplifier that works with our old speakers so that they can be our loyal friends again.    REPOP is the smallest wooden portable amplifier with bluetooth function. With CSR Bluetooth 4.0 Chip, REPOP supports both APT-X and AAC, and gives you wonderful sound quality. What's even more, with exclusive Pure&Sound technique, it reduces much noise and distortion.Connect any passive speaker with this exclusive multifunctional amplifier, and play music simply via bluetooth. It is compatible with all bluetooth devices: tablets, mobile phones and computers. The power of REPOP is 30W ( 15Wx2 ). With its solid stereo system, it can amplify 90% of the passive speakers on the market. Equipped with a 4000mAh built-in battery, REPOP lasts approximately 6~8 hours for a 50W / 8 ohm speaker.  It works well with 10W ~ 100W / 4~8 ohm loudspeakers.REPOP works well with all music devices: DJ sets / TVs / video game consoles / CD, DVD, BD players.


REPOP can also be a bluetooth music receiver .Banana Plugs



General CablesHandmadeEach and every REPOP is handmade. Wanting to break away from traditional design, we believe wooden products look good and harmonious in every kind of space, and it brings out a sense of warmth. So we choose to make REPOP with teak wood and handcraft skills. Jack, the craftsman with 35 years experience, used his special skills to do 45-degree embedding, and used an exclusive 8-step stacking technique to complete the box of REPOP. In addition, different from ordinary iron or wooden panels, the anodized aluminum back panel we use can dissipate heat more effectively and help the panel last longer. TeakUnique in Southeast Asia, teak wood is denser and harder than general wood, with resistance to wear and tear. More importantly, teakwood naturally features lacquer and resin that has its own beauty, while protecting it from temperature changes, humidity, and other environmental factors. Specially, with extraordinary technique, we used residual teak wood and turned it into spliced solid wood which amazingly brought out diverse faces of beautiful wood grains. Reusing residual teak wood is also an environmentally-friendly way to produce products.Circuit DesignWe spent a lot of time prototyping, revising and testing.

Introducing Celsus Sound SP One speaker: Spacious sound stage, commanding bass, exemplary coherence and musicality

The SP One's enclosure is made of a dense, premium-quality, naturally finished bamboo. The carbon-fiber woofer, featuring an aluminum wave guide, nicely complements the cabinet's sophisticated styling. Indeed, the speaker is even better looking hands-on than in the photo. We feel quite safe in claiming that this is the best speaker in our experience costing less than $1000 / pair. When the SP One goes on sale at the end of March, 2016, it will list at $649. To sweeten the deal we are including it as a perk to this project at a 30% discount -- a remarkable value not to be passed up.Additional high resolution photos can be see here: https://goo.gl/photos/Ro9JxLy47K7tTHv99
NuPrime WR-100 AllPlay receiver is now bundled with SP One free of charge (we can't change the Perk's description)The WR-100 is a hi-resolution (24-bit/96kHz) wireless and wired (with ethernet port) audio receiver that can be used to stream local, network (NAS, DLNA server) or online music (Spotify, etc) to multiple WR-100 throughout the home WiFi network. WR-100 can also accept analog input from your turntable or old iPod for streaming. You can connect the output of WR-100 to active speakers such as the Celsus Sound SP One, or to your existing audio components, including home theater receivers.

<p>Today, <b>the highest audio quality possible is from computers</b>.

Now, with the ESSENCE, you no longer have to sacrifice sound quality as a result.</p>

<p>The<b> Essence is 3x smaller than any other high-end speaker system</b> on the market. State-of-the-art electronics play their part, but the real secret is preservation of energy. Here's how.  </p>
<p><b>The cabinet</b>: Most speakers have an MDF cabinet. MDF is an inexpensive, relatively soft material which acts like a sponge. It eats energy, softening and deadening the sound. The Essence, in contrast, has a thick die-cast aluminium cabinet, far more expensive than MDF, but it doesn't swallow energy. Like all metals, however, aluminium has a tendency to ring, which is why most aluminium cabinets from other manufacturers are not successful. To counteract this trait, in the Essence the panels are locked together with a complex series of grooves, then tightened under immense forces with stainless steel bolts that run the length of the cabinet, essentially turning the cabinet into one solid, inert block free of resonances. This preserves all the positives of an aluminium cabinet, with none of the negatives. Combined, these two unique attributes are very difficult and expensive to make, but result in the exceptional clarity the Essence is becoming known for.</p>
<p><b>The driver</b>: The coaxial driver also plays its part. Besides the superior stereo imaging inherent to a coaxial driver, it has an extremely light moving mass of just 4.5 grams, which is less than half the weight typical for a 4.5"" driver. You can't beat physics, and just like a small, light car can change direction quicker than a heavier car, a light moving mass results in sound that is far quicker, livelier, and more engaging. Combine that with the inert cabinet, and you start to understand why the Essence is so special and why it sounds so powerful despite its small size.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1464803194/assemblygraph_jofy3h.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1464803202/SOUND-01_vxybj5.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>It's hard to argue that this isn't the most important aspect of a speaker, so the audio performance of the Essence has been our primary focus and driving force from the start. It's also the aspect we're most proud of.</p>
<p>The sound quality of the Essence turns everyone's heads, whether they've never heard a high-end system before or are an audiophile veteran who's heard everything. The greatest skeptic is convinced the moment they hear them. They're that good, something multiple audio critics have confirmed in their reviews. </p>
<p>In short, they sound fantastic, with <b>a powerful, dynamic presentation, and superb stereo imaging</b>. The way the sound is spread between the speakers is almost holographic. Listeners particularly praise the incredible clarity and speed of the sound. The purity of the sound takes the breath away.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1464803227/BW_010_fjyk86.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The Essence has a very rich, clear midrange, so vocals, horns, and guitars are particularly impressive. A local female vocalist told us she has never heard herself sound as good, and as realistic, as on the Essence.</p>
<p>Bass is quick, tight, and rhythmic, not mushy and boomy like many other speakers. They have what is often referred to as the ""jump factor"".</p>
<p>It's the sound quality of the Essence that most turns heads during demonstrations, and as good as they are as a home or office system, they are also <b>ideally suited as compact studio monitors due to the neutrality and pureness of the sound</b>.</p>

<p>Feniks was founded with the aim of providing the best listening experience and exceptional quality to as many customers as possible without compromises. With the shifts in listening habits over the past decade away from traditional hi-fi to computers and all-in-one devices, true not just among general consumers but audiophiles, too, a regular speaker made no sense at all. The same was true with us. We spent hours each day on the computer working, watching YouTube and movies, and listening to music. Problem was there was no high quality computer speaker available on the market so you had to settle between either generic plastic junk or spring for a pair of high-end monitors and the associated electronics (not ideal anyway as they’re designed for farfield listening). So we decided we had to do it ourselves, and Feniks was born.</p>
<p>The Essence, with an internal 24-bit/96kHz DAC, is the latest generation of this concept, and it’s <b>the only high-end computer speaker system designed from the ground up to be a computer speaker system</b>. Putting a DAC into a traditional large bookshelf speaker, as the “competition” has tried, does not a computer speaker make. More than just that, however, the Essence is the most compact high-end speaker available today, period. If you want truly stellar performance in a small package or have limited space, there is no better speaker on the market for you.</p>

</div><div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">An internal DAC was a must. </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">It was also essential that it be both superior to preceding technologies while still being efficient to manufacture, so a die-cast aluminium cabinet was chosen, using a special grade, low resonance alloy. One of the huge benefits of die-casting is that every piece is identical to within a few microns, giving us far more control over the final outcome and quality.</span>
</div><div>
<p>After the design was more or less complete, we proceeded to the prototype stage. These were made using a method called sand casting, wherein an expensive one-off mold is made. It's the same method Ferrari uses to cast their engine blocks.</p>
<p>After further adjustments, molds were ordered, with one mold for each panel (six in total). The molds costs over $10,000 each and weigh many tons. </p>
<p>The speakers you see in the photos are among 12 preproduction samples made. They're made using the same die-cast molds that will be used to manufacture the production versions you will receive, and are therefore nearly identical to the final product. </p>

<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">As amazing as the Essence is, we hit a roadblock: the steep margins of high-end audio distributors and dealers. This industry is not geared for selling products to the masses. Rather, it aims for low-volume yet high margin products, where a single sale can net a distributor and dealer thousands of dollars. Did you know a high-end audio manufacturer only gets about a third of the retail price? The result, plain to see across the industry, is increasingly high prices and little interest in fair pricing. This situation doesn’t leave much room for comparatively inexpensive yet exceptionally innovative and high-quality products like the Essence, and goes completely against our original aim of getting great quality to as many customers as possible.</span></p>
<p>The industry was pushing us to set a US MSRP at close to $3000. Are they worth it? Compared to other products on the market with similarly high margins, absolutely yes, but a price like that closes the door on the every day music lover we most want to reach. It would transform our product from something an enthusiast can afford to a luxury product for the 1%. That’s not what we want, hence why we did a Kickstarter campaign. By offering direct sales to you, our fans and customers, we're giving you a chance to purchase the Essence at half price, and worldwide shipping is included! Did we mention they’re actually assembled by hand in Switzerland? It’s the only way to maintain strict control over our exacting standards.</p>
<p>We believe that everyone deserves to experience the highest fidelity sound in the comfort of their own home. If you want <b>the best desktop listening experience in the world</b>, and appreciate the beautiful design and bulletproof construction, look no further than the Essence.

<h2>FAQ</h2>
<div><b>Does the system have wireless?</b></div>
<div>
<p>With the Essence, we set out to make a timeless classic, focusing heavily on making bulletproof build quality so that they will bring you many years of enjoyment. Wireless standards are constantly changing, so we didn't want such a high quality product to have an aspect which could become obsolete in a short period of time (even the best current Bluetooth standard, aptX, is limited to only 352kbps, not enough for a lossless FLAC file such as TIDAL provides, let alone 24-bit).</p>
<p>We recommend using a relatively inexpensive Bluetooth receiver with an Optical audio out (so that you still take advantage of the excellent DAC). This way when wireless technologies improve down the road, you only need to replace the inexpensive receiver, not the whole system.</p>
<p>However, you'll get the best quality from your phone by using an Apple Camera Connection Kit (iPhone/iPad) or OTG adapter (Android), which allows your phone to be plugged into the USB input.</p>
<b>Why is there no remote?</b>
</div>
<div>
<p>An incredible desktop experience was our primary aim in developing the Essence, so it was a priority for the top-mounted volume wheel to be a delight to use.</p>
<p>For the best sound quality, we chose to use an analog preamp (a preamp prepares the signal for the amplifier). With an analog preamp, we would have had to use a motorized potentiometer for remote functionality, which would greatly increase the resistance of the wheel and no longer would it be buttery-smooth.</p>
<p>Compromises are always a part of a design, especially with an advanced product like the Essence. This is one of those compromises we felt was the right one, and part of what makes the Essence the ultimate desktop sound system.</p>
<b>Is the user-guide multi-language?</b>
</div>
<p>Yes! The user guide is in English, German, French, Italian, Spanish, and Simplified Chinese.</p>

The ESSENCE is being hailed by the audio press as the world's best computer speaker system and a standout product heralding the future of audio. It's a beautiful, incredible product for audiophiles, music lovers, film buffs, gamers, or anyone who loves high quality audio. The ESSENCE represents the best of the best in loudspeaker engineering and design, leveraging sophisticated methods and techniques, a coaxial driver, resonance-free die-cast aluminium cabinet, and the finest components to drastically miniaturize the high-end experience.

It's almost hard to believe how many advanced features have been packed into such a compact form, making the ESSENCE the ideal sound system for computers, televisions, turntables, and for use in small recording studios. Beautiful and compact, it features:  


in-house developed 4.5"" coaxial driver for superior stereo imaging

integrated 24-bit/96kHz DAC custom designed for the ESSENCE, based around the latest ESS Sabre DAC chip technology
three-panel die-cast aluminium cabinet, held together internally under immense pressure with stainless steel bolts to eliminate resonances, an industry-first concept
50W/channel RMS (100W total) ICEpower® amplification module
USB, Toslink, and analog inputs
audiophile-quality amplified headphone stage for late night listening
designed and assembled by hand in Switzerland

An obsessive attention to detail and an innovative modular assembly system ensure that craftsmanship is second to none. With the exception of a few screws, every component is custom designed and manufactured exclusively for the ESSENCE or not available off-the-shelf.

Less than 20cm tall and just 12cm wide, the ESSENCE is:

a work of art for the eyes, ears, and soul
the smallest genuinely high-end speaker system in the world
the first high-end computer speaker system in the world designed from the outset for this very purpose. It's not just a retrofit of a traditional, over-sized MDF speaker
in a review by popular audiophile website 6moons received the rare Blue Moon Award and was called the “world’s best computer speaker system”.

You won't find a speaker system of similar quality and functionality for anywhere near the price of the ESSENCE. Before we decided to do a Kickstarter campaign, we looked into the traditional distributor sales model, but the high margins would have required setting the price at close to $3000, not a good option for our customers. Thanks to e-commerce, we can now offer them for half that!

 
 
With USB, Toslink, and analog inputs, the ESSENCE is far from being just a computer speaker system, even though that's what we set out to design. It's an incredibly versatile system ideal for a wide range of devices.


asynchronous USB for amazing quality and plug-and-play operation on any Windows or Mac computer  
can also use with an Apple USB Camera Adapter (iPhone/iPad) or OTG adapter (Android 5.0+) to play music from your phone
the system automatically enters and wakes from standby when you turn off your computer or put it to sleep



Televisions which have an Optical audio out  
Bluetooth receivers which have an Optical audio out
many other digital devices such as CD players
the system automatically enters and wakes from standby when you turn your digital device on or off



3.5mm stereo mini jack for phones/tablets  
RCA/AUX inputs for phono stages for an awesome compact turntable system
the analog and digital signals in the Essence run in parallel, meaning the analog signal is never digitized for a pure analog experience, so you can also use an external DAC with no loss of quality



Today, the highest audio quality possible is from computers. Surprising as it sounds, it's the truth, and explains why most audio companies now use computers and lossless audio files to demonstrate their products at audio shows. Which is great news, because today, more than ever before, many of us spend our days in front of a computer. And often, we listen to music when we do. Now, with the ESSENCE, you no longer have to sacrifice sound quality as a result.
For true fans of music and films, few things beat out the experience of listening on a pair of really great speakers. Speakers vibrate the air and your body in a way no headphone ever could. For those who want the ultimate desktop sound quality, there is no better option than the ESSENCE. It's a true high end product, designed with a purist approach, aiming for the highest levels of sonic quality, and using the highest quality components.
More than one person has remarked that listening to their favorite music through the ESSENCE is like hearing it for the first time. It'll transport you to a different world of newfound clarity. Whether you see it as an amazing computer speaker, or simply an impossibly small high-end monitor, reviews confirm that the ESSENCE is the real deal, setting new paradigms for a speaker of this size and price.



The Essence is 3x smaller than any other high-end speaker system on the market. State-of-the-art electronics play their part, but the real secret is preservation of energy. Here's how.  
The cabinet: Most speakers have an MDF cabinet. MDF is an inexpensive, relatively soft material which acts like a sponge. It eats energy, softening and deadening the sound. The Essence, in contrast, has a thick die-cast aluminium cabinet, far more expensive than MDF, but it doesn't swallow energy. Like all metals, however, aluminium has a tendency to ring, which is why most aluminium cabinets from other manufacturers are not successful. To counteract this trait, in the Essence the panels are locked together with a complex series of grooves, then tightened under immense forces with stainless steel bolts that run the length of the cabinet, essentially turning the cabinet into one solid, inert block free of resonances. This preserves all the positives of an aluminium cabinet, with none of the negatives. Combined, these two unique attributes are very difficult and expensive to make, but result in the exceptional clarity the Essence is becoming known for.
The driver: The coaxial driver also plays its part. Besides the superior stereo imaging inherent to a coaxial driver, it has an extremely light moving mass of just 4.5 grams, which is less than half the weight typical for a 4.5"" driver. You can't beat physics, and just like a small, light car can change direction quicker than a heavier car, a light moving mass results in sound that is far quicker, livelier, and more engaging. Combine that with the inert cabinet, and you start to understand why the Essence is so special and why it sounds so powerful despite its small size.


It's hard to argue that this isn't the most important aspect of a speaker, so the audio performance of the Essence has been our primary focus and driving force from the start. It's also the aspect we're most proud of.
The sound quality of the Essence turns everyone's heads, whether they've never heard a high-end system before or are an audiophile veteran who's heard everything. The greatest skeptic is convinced the moment they hear them. They're that good, something multiple audio critics have confirmed in their reviews. 
In short, they sound fantastic, with a powerful, dynamic presentation, and superb stereo imaging. The way the sound is spread between the speakers is almost holographic. Listeners particularly praise the incredible clarity and speed of the sound. The purity of the sound takes the breath away.

The Essence has a very rich, clear midrange, so vocals, horns, and guitars are particularly impressive. A local female vocalist told us she has never heard herself sound as good, and as realistic, as on the Essence.
Bass is quick, tight, and rhythmic, not mushy and boomy like many other speakers. They have what is often referred to as the ""jump factor"".
It's the sound quality of the Essence that most turns heads during demonstrations, and as good as they are as a home or office system, they are also ideally suited as compact studio monitors due to the neutrality and pureness of the sound.

Feniks was founded with the aim of providing the best listening experience and exceptional quality to as many customers as possible without compromises. With the shifts in listening habits over the past decade away from traditional hi-fi to computers and all-in-one devices, true not just among general consumers but audiophiles, too, a regular speaker made no sense at all. The same was true with us. We spent hours each day on the computer working, watching YouTube and movies, and listening to music. Problem was there was no high quality computer speaker available on the market so you had to settle between either generic plastic junk or spring for a pair of high-end monitors and the associated electronics (not ideal anyway as they’re designed for farfield listening). So we decided we had to do it ourselves, and Feniks was born.
The Essence, with an internal 24-bit/96kHz DAC, is the latest generation of this concept, and it’s the only high-end computer speaker system designed from the ground up to be a computer speaker system. Putting a DAC into a traditional large bookshelf speaker, as the “competition” has tried, does not a computer speaker make. More than just that, however, the Essence is the most compact high-end speaker available today, period. If you want truly stellar performance in a small package or have limited space, there is no better speaker on the market for you.

The Essence is the result of over two years of development, thousands of man hours, and 15 prototypes, to get to where we are today. We set out to design an extremely thorough and mature product, both in terms of design and technology. 

An internal DAC was a must. It was also essential that it be both superior to preceding technologies while still being efficient to manufacture, so a die-cast aluminium cabinet was chosen, using a special grade, low resonance alloy. One of the huge benefits of die-casting is that every piece is identical to within a few microns, giving us far more control over the final outcome and quality.

After the design was more or less complete, we proceeded to the prototype stage. These were made using a method called sand casting, wherein an expensive one-off mold is made. It's the same method Ferrari uses to cast their engine blocks.
After further adjustments, molds were ordered, with one mold for each panel (six in total). The molds costs over $10,000 each and weigh many tons. 
The speakers you see in the photos are among 12 preproduction samples made. They're made using the same die-cast molds that will be used to manufacture the production versions you will receive, and are therefore nearly identical to the final product. 
Testing at home:
 


The Essence is packed with industry-first innovations aimed at making the best sounding speaker possible, and it's not value engineered to reach a target price: this is a superbly engineered cost-no-object precision machine with every visible surface made from metal. 

Each speaker cabinet consists of just 3 thick aluminium precision die-cast panels made of a special low resonance aluminium alloy.


The side panel is clamped between the front and rear panel using threaded stainless steel tension rods, interlocking with each other thanks to a system of grooves which run along the entire length of the joints. 
The immense pressure under which the rods are tightened bonds the panels together, almost as if they were one solid block. The panels stay under continuous compression, further eliminating unwanted resonances.
Internal ribs not only reinforce the panels, but their irregular placement eliminates resonances at different frequencies.
The thick panels work as radiators for the electronics inside.



In the Essence, each component serves as part of a whole, all being bolted one after another to the front panel, which in turn is sandwiched between the driver basket and external grill ring, forming a 14mm thick front panel. 
We call the modular nature of this system the Feniks Modular Assembly System, or FMAS.





The bass ports, integrated into the casts of the side panels, are different lengths in the right and left channels, thus covering different frequencies. The foot panel below acts to extend the length of the port. 
In most speakers the bass port is tuned to add volume to the bass, usually creating a distorted ""boom"" at a specific frequency. In the Essence the port serves to extend the low frequencies, thereby giving a more balanced, clean, and natural sound. 


The coaxial driver
The 4.5"" custom-designed coaxial driver of the Essence is the heart of the system. A coaxial driver is the ideal choice for a nearfield computer system as it guarantees a point-source sound, meaning superior stereo imaging. A coaxial driver is also less sensitive to proper placement because you don't need to match the alignment of multiple drivers.

As amazing as the Essence is, we hit a roadblock: the steep margins of high-end audio distributors and dealers. This industry is not geared for selling products to the masses. Rather, it aims for low-volume yet high margin products, where a single sale can net a distributor and dealer thousands of dollars. Did you know a high-end audio manufacturer only gets about a third of the retail price? The result, plain to see across the industry, is increasingly high prices and little interest in fair pricing. This situation doesn’t leave much room for comparatively inexpensive yet exceptionally innovative and high-quality products like the Essence, and goes completely against our original aim of getting great quality to as many customers as possible.
The industry was pushing us to set a US MSRP at close to $3000. Are they worth it? Compared to other products on the market with similarly high margins, absolutely yes, but a price like that closes the door on the every day music lover we most want to reach. It would transform our product from something an enthusiast can afford to a luxury product for the 1%. That’s not what we want, hence why we did a Kickstarter campaign. By offering direct sales to you, our fans and customers, we're giving you a chance to purchase the Essence at half price, and worldwide shipping is included! Did we mention they’re actually assembled by hand in Switzerland? It’s the only way to maintain strict control over our exacting standards.
We believe that everyone deserves to experience the highest fidelity sound in the comfort of their own home. If you want the best desktop listening experience in the world, and appreciate the beautiful design and bulletproof construction, look no further than the Essence. You’ll get to experience some of the best stereo imaging on the market, a pure clear sound that rivals the best of the best at any price, and a fantastic DAC and headphone amp to boot. Let it enable you to enjoy your music and films more than you ever have before. Reviews confirm that the Essence is the real deal: don’t miss your chance to back the “world’s best computer speaker system”.

It's been a long and hard road to get to where we are now and bring the Essence into reality, and we're incredibly proud of what we've achieved as underdogs in this industry. But we need your support to get to the next step and bring the Essence into production and into the hands of lovers of true quality.
More than anything that's what we believe the Essence is about, a vote for true quality, craftsmanship, and beauty.

FAQ
Does the system have wireless?

With the Essence, we set out to make a timeless classic, focusing heavily on making bulletproof build quality so that they will bring you many years of enjoyment. Wireless standards are constantly changing, so we didn't want such a high quality product to have an aspect which could become obsolete in a short period of time (even the best current Bluetooth standard, aptX, is limited to only 352kbps, not enough for a lossless FLAC file such as TIDAL provides, let alone 24-bit).
We recommend using a relatively inexpensive Bluetooth receiver with an Optical audio out (so that you still take advantage of the excellent DAC). This way when wireless technologies improve down the road, you only need to replace the inexpensive receiver, not the whole system.
However, you'll get the best quality from your phone by using an Apple Camera Connection Kit (iPhone/iPad) or OTG adapter (Android), which allows your phone to be plugged into the USB input.
Why is there no remote?


An incredible desktop experience was our primary aim in developing the Essence, so it was a priority for the top-mounted volume wheel to be a delight to use.
For the best sound quality, we chose to use an analog preamp (a preamp prepares the signal for the amplifier). With an analog preamp, we would have had to use a motorized potentiometer for remote functionality, which would greatly increase the resistance of the wheel and no longer would it be buttery-smooth.
Compromises are always a part of a design, especially with an advanced product like the Essence. This is one of those compromises we felt was the right one, and part of what makes the Essence the ultimate desktop sound system.
Is the user-guide multi-language?

Yes! The user guide is in English, German, French, Italian, Spanish, and Simplified Chinese.

We would donate all profits for August and September. We could also consider creating a special yellow pair of headphones for the campaign!<br/> <br/>McGrath Foundation Pink Test<br/>We would love to partner with the McGrath Foundation for the Pink Test and donate all the profits for Beat Cancer for January. We think our pink headphones tie in really well with the Pink Test.  <br/> <br/>Olivia Newton-John Cancer Wellness and Research Center<br/>We could partner with the Olivia Newton-John Cancer Wellness and Research Center during Run Melbourne or The Wellness Walk &amp; Research Run and donate the profits for the months in which these events are held.

Comparable headphones sell for between $300-$550.  We can sell high-quality headphones at this price because we don’t have the costs that other businesses do. We buy from the manufacturer, so there is no middleman, we don’t pay for advertising, we don’t have an office. The whole business runs off a laptop and a dream of a cancer-free life.  We have no marketing budget and we are relying on word of mouth, so it would be great if you could share our campaign with your friends and family. The more people who see the campaign, the more likely we are to reach (and smash) the funding goal.  Crowd Funding  Campaign Details  The details of the campaign are as follows:The headphones are available in 3 colours black, pink and red that will be released as we reach our funding goals. All pre-sales by default will be for a Black pair of Beat Cancer Founder Series Headphones. The red and pink options will become available if we can achieve pre-sales of 300 per colour. If we sell 300 pairs, we will generate revenue of $30,000, which will cover the $25,000 cost of the minimum order of 500 units. As soon as we reach our funding goal of $30,000 Beat Cancer comes to life! We have a second funding goal of $50,000, as this level of funding will allow us to purchase a second stock order, and we can set up a sustainable, ongoing online store. Once the campaign closes we expect to be mailing the headphones to you from Australia within 30 days. Headphone Features  Wireless Bluetooth Acoustic Noise CancellingCompatible with different phones – iPhone and Android     Suitable for various environments: Aeroplane, tram, train and noisy office. Transmission distance - 10m Chord and connectors for use on an aeroplaneCharging port – USB Standby time – 120 Hours Talking time – 18 Hours Playing time – 10 Hours (with ANC on) Charging time – 3 Hours Battery type - Built-in 600mah rechargeable lithium battery Certification - CE,FCC,ROHS UN38.3 600mAh High-quality rechargeable Lithium batteryBenefits These are some of the benefits to pledging today:- We will place you on our Register of Founders that will live forever live stapled to the company's constitution.  - You get a pair of BEAT Cancer founder series headphones. After the campaign, the founder series will never be sold again.  - You get to play a key role in bringing our business to life, a business with the power to change the world. We give you additional choice by empowering you to choose what happens with the profits from your purchases. Which charities receive the profits from Beat Cancer Headphones? You can help decide!Our strategy is to partner with a number of charities over time. We will aim to partner with a single charity for a fixed period that aligns to the charity's main fundraising efforts and give them the profits from  Beat Cancer that are earned in the period. Here are  a few examples that we have identified: Cancer Council Daffodil DayIt would be great to partner with the Cancer Council for Daffodil Day. We would donate all profits for August and September. We could also consider creating a special yellow pair of headphones for the campaign! McGrath Foundation Pink TestWe would love to partner with the McGrath Foundation for the Pink Test and donate all the profits for Beat Cancer for January. We think our pink headphones tie in really well with the Pink Test.   Olivia Newton-John Cancer Wellness and Research CenterWe could partner with the Olivia Newton-John Cancer Wellness and Research Center during Run Melbourne or The Wellness Walk & Research Run and donate the profits for the months in which these events are held. Given Olivia Newton-John’s relationship with the music industry, we see some great synergies with Beat Cancer Headphones.Before the campaign, we approached many charities about forming a partnership, however, as many charities are extremely time poor and that just two weeks ago Beat Cancer was just a dream, we have had little response.

<p>Inventor of the technology and the product Honeycomb Broadband Antenna. Provisional patent applied for in October 11, 2011</p>
<p>After being forced to retire as a result of arthritis, I found out that being 49 years old with a medical condition made it impossible to find work.

<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>When the thought of combining two brand new technology's together came to me, I never thought that this new technology would change the way antennas are made.

The antennas got very tiny without losing any integrity. Imagine this, I developed an antenna the size of a cigarette butt able to receive digital and analog channels from as far as 100 miles away. A cell phone antenna the size of a dime able to receive 3G to 6G's for the <a href=""http://wpspencerllc.com/"" id=""_GPLITA_1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""text-decoration: underline;"" title=""Powered by Text-Enhance"">phones</a> of the future.

Provisional and utility patents have been filed for the early stage products. Our plan is to be in the market as early as 2014.

<p>The frame of the headband is made of memory alloy with titanium as the main ingredient. Memory alloy allows large shape change (flexibility) while maintaining the original shape when force is removed. During deformation, memory alloy actually goes through a phase change which is what allows the elastic deformation to be reversible.</p>
<p></p>

<p><b><u>Can bone conducted sound cause hearing loss?</u></b></p>
<p></p>
<p>No. In fact, that's a key benefit of bone conduction headphones! We don't have a medical professional on staff, but we did research the concept. Here's the professional opinion of an M.D. from the largest ENT comprehensive care provider in the New York tri-state area: </p>
<p><i>""Unlike conventional headphones, bone conduction headphones have an inherent volume limit which should reduce noise related hearing loss. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">This technology also keeps the ear canals open, which makes it ideal for sports requiring heightened situational awareness, such as cycling or running.""</span></i></p>

<p><b><u>Is bone conduction technology a solution for someone with hearing loss?</u></b></p>
<p>Yes and no. Trekz are not intended to be used as a hearing aid; however, they are a solution for some people with hearing loss (depending on where the damage is in the ear) to play music and make/take calls. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b><u>What colors does Trekz Titanium™ come in?</u></b></p>
<p>To start, Trekz Titanium™ will be produced in Ocean (Blue/Black), Ivy (Green/Black), and Slate (Grey/Black). Additional colors are planned for 2016.</p>
<p><b><u></u></b></p>
<p><b><u>What are the specifications for the activity belt?</u></b></p>
<p>The adjustable activity belt holds large smartphones (up to iPhone 6 Plus &amp; Samsung Galaxy S6), keys, cash, ID/credit cards, passports &amp; other small personal items. The comfortable band fits securely &amp; prevents chafing and bouncing. It fits waist size 25""-47"" (63.5cm – 119.4cm), pocket expands to 8″×4″x 2"" (20.3cm-10.2cm-5.1cm). </p>

What's the wireless range of Trekz Titanium™?
Trekz Titanium™ will offer reliable connectivity within a wireless range of 33 ft (10m).





Can bone conducted sound cause hearing loss?

No. In fact, that's a key benefit of bone conduction headphones! We don't have a medical professional on staff, but we did research the concept. Here's the professional opinion of an M.D. from the largest ENT comprehensive care provider in the New York tri-state area: 
""Unlike conventional headphones, bone conduction headphones have an inherent volume limit which should reduce noise related hearing loss. This technology also keeps the ear canals open, which makes it ideal for sports requiring heightened situational awareness, such as cycling or running.""
Wontaek Choe, M.D.
Otology/Neurotology and Lateral Skull Base Surgery
ENT and Allergy Associates, LLP |  www.entandallergy.com
Is bone conduction technology a solution for someone with hearing loss?
Yes and no. Trekz are not intended to be used as a hearing aid; however, they are a solution for some people with hearing loss (depending on where the damage is in the ear) to play music and make/take calls. 

What colors does Trekz Titanium™ come in?
To start, Trekz Titanium™ will be produced in Ocean (Blue/Black), Ivy (Green/Black), and Slate (Grey/Black). Additional colors are planned for 2016.

What are the specifications for the activity belt?
The adjustable activity belt holds large smartphones (up to iPhone 6 Plus & Samsung Galaxy S6), keys, cash, ID/credit cards, passports & other small personal items. The comfortable band fits securely & prevents chafing and bouncing. It fits waist size 25""-47"" (63.5cm – 119.4cm), pocket expands to 8″×4″x 2"" (20.3cm-10.2cm-5.1cm).

<p><strong>How is the wireless sound quality?</strong></p>
<p>We are using the most advanced Bluetooth solution currently available, with an aptX-HD codec capable of 24-bit music quality. </p>
<p><strong>What’s the battery life like?</strong></p>
<p>Wireless playback time for MyAudioSession headphones is up to 30 hours. A full charge will take up to 90 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>What about wireless charging?</strong></p>
<p>MyAudioSession headphones are compatible with QI wireless charging and will take up to 90 minutes for a full charge. </p>
<p><strong>Does MyAudioSession come with a mic cable?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, MyAudioSession will come with a one-button mic cable. </p>
<p><strong>Where can I get the MyAudioSession app?</strong></p>
<p>The MyAudioSession app will be available on the Apple Store and Google Play store. The app will be compatible with iOS and Android. </p>
<p><strong>How does the personal hearing profile work?</strong></p>
<p>The MyAudioSession app will provide a short hearing test for your ears by emitting beeps at specific frequencies. You will use a dial to determine when you can just barely hear the tone. After going through specific frequencies for both left and right ears, the app will calibrate a personal audio profile optimized just for you. </p>
<p><strong>Will I need to do the test every time I want to use the profile?</strong></p>
<p>No, your custom profile will be saved onto the headphone, so you won’t even have to open the app after unless you would like to create or apply a different hearing profile. We do recommend re-testing your hearing on a regular basis to ensure the most accurate, optimized profile.</p>
<p><strong>Why do I need a personalized profile? Doesn’t an equalizer do the same thing?</strong></p>
<p>While modern equalizers can perform functions that seem similar on the surface, MyAudioSession completely tailors your listening experience by enhancing your audio profile based on actual clinical trials and calibrating a 15-band- per-ear result superior to standard EQs. </p>
<p><strong>Can I use my personalized hearing profile without Bluetooth? </strong></p>
<p>Currently, your personalized profile can only be used with Bluetooth. When using an audio cable, the personal hearing profile will be inactive.</p>
<p><strong>What content can I use the personal hearing profile for?</strong></p>
<p>Whether it be music, calls, or Youtube videos, the personalized hearing profile will enhance the sound through the headphone. </p>
<p><strong>Do you support AAC for Apple devices?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, we support AAC.</p>
<p><strong>Will the personalized hearing profile work if I have severe hearing loss?</strong></p>
<p>The personalized hearing profile can improve your audio experience but is not meant to be a substitute for hearing aids. </p>
<p><strong>What about shipping fees and taxes?</strong></p>
<p>All our perks will come with FREE SHIPPING. You will be responsible for paying import duties or taxes, if applicable, in your country or state.</p>
<p><strong>Do MyAudioSession headphones come with a warranty?</strong></p>
<p>MyAudioSession headphones come with a 30-day money back guarantee – be it comfort or sound, we will provide a full refund if there is anything you don’t like about the headphone. After 30 days, we will repair or replace any defective units at no cost for up to a year following delivery.</p>

 Like fingerprints or DNA, each person’s ears and hearing ability are unique. So why are we currently sold a ""one size fits all"" within the headphone market?
 As we use our sense of hearing everyday, our ears can become less sensitive to certain frequencies due to fatigue and damage. Important details in our music, films and games can be lost due to the resulting imbalance in our ears.  Often, people will simply turn up the volume to compensate, but the frequencies which were acceptable before could now create a sense of audio distortion, increasing the amount of listening fatigue and potentially damaging your sense of hearing even further.   
Now with MyAudioSession you can immerse yourself in enriched audio which is uniquely optimized for you and without the limitation of wires.
We have licensed and integrated Aumeo Audio’s patented technology into our headphones and our mobile app, which aims to balance the user’s listening profile and enhance their audio enjoyment without the issues that volume adjustment and traditional equalizers create.
 Test your ears by letting the app know when you can hear the low beeps across certain frequency ranges. The app will then sync this information with your headphones, which will then adapt to your profile, making sure you hear your music the way it was intended. 
   The video below demonstrates how to...1) Easily calibrate and optimize your listening experience 2) Pair MyAudioSession effortlessly with NFC 3) Skip the cables and utilise QI-compatible wireless charging (charging platform included)  1. Titanium drivers deliver exceptional sound and clarity. 2. Enjoy an unparalleled HD wireless audio experience. 1. Up to 30 hours of personally-optimized sound, at home or on-the-go. 2. Listen in absolute comfort for extended periods of time.  Global Sources ExpoWhen we visited Global Sources Expo we were honoured to win the ""Best In Technology"" and the ""Analyst's Choice"" awards! Thank you to everyone who came down to both events and got involved with MyAudioSession!
  Hong Kong Electronics Fair   Here at The Audio Session we are committed to creating cutting-edge audio equipment, to give you, our community, a ground breaking musical experience and we can't wait for you to join us!     From humble beginnings as a Hong Kong-based company, the members of The Audio Session have been involved in the design and development of personal audio equipment with major industry leaders around the world for over 30 years.
  
Located in Hong Kong Science Park, we are continually inspired by the state-of-the-art environment and have been regularly collaborating with local tech teams to integrate advanced wireless and audio technology with our headphones.
Launched in 2017, The Audio Session brand was created with the purpose of providing an exceptional listening experience with thoughtfully-crafted and expertly-engineered headphones.
Our latest project, MyAudioSession, aims to unite our decades of audio expertise with innovative sound-personalization technology to create an acoustically superior headphone that can enrich the user’s enjoyment of music.  


 

As with all hardware projects, there are always risks associated with manufacturing and supply chain logistics. Unlike most startups and designer-centric ventures, the members of The Audio Session have already successfully brought thousands of headphones and audio hardware products to market.
With over 30 years of experience, we have built robust, long-lasting relationships with industry-leading suppliers, manufacturers and shipping partners to ensure a smooth process from design to fulfilment. We are confident in our ability to identify and mitigate any potential issues that may arise, so that we can produce and deliver MyAudioSession on time.

How is the wireless sound quality?
We are using the most advanced Bluetooth solution currently available, with an aptX-HD codec capable of 24-bit music quality. 
What’s the battery life like?
Wireless playback time for MyAudioSession headphones is up to 30 hours. A full charge will take up to 90 minutes.
What about wireless charging?
MyAudioSession headphones are compatible with QI wireless charging and will take up to 90 minutes for a full charge. 
Does MyAudioSession come with a mic cable?
Yes, MyAudioSession will come with a one-button mic cable. 
Where can I get the MyAudioSession app?
The MyAudioSession app will be available on the Apple Store and Google Play store. The app will be compatible with iOS and Android. 
How does the personal hearing profile work?
The MyAudioSession app will provide a short hearing test for your ears by emitting beeps at specific frequencies. You will use a dial to determine when you can just barely hear the tone. After going through specific frequencies for both left and right ears, the app will calibrate a personal audio profile optimized just for you. 
Will I need to do the test every time I want to use the profile?
No, your custom profile will be saved onto the headphone, so you won’t even have to open the app after unless you would like to create or apply a different hearing profile. We do recommend re-testing your hearing on a regular basis to ensure the most accurate, optimized profile.
Why do I need a personalized profile? Doesn’t an equalizer do the same thing?
While modern equalizers can perform functions that seem similar on the surface, MyAudioSession completely tailors your listening experience by enhancing your audio profile based on actual clinical trials and calibrating a 15-band- per-ear result superior to standard EQs. 
Can I use my personalized hearing profile without Bluetooth? 
Currently, your personalized profile can only be used with Bluetooth. When using an audio cable, the personal hearing profile will be inactive.
What content can I use the personal hearing profile for?
Whether it be music, calls, or Youtube videos, the personalized hearing profile will enhance the sound through the headphone. 
Do you support AAC for Apple devices?
Yes, we support AAC.
Will the personalized hearing profile work if I have severe hearing loss?
The personalized hearing profile can improve your audio experience but is not meant to be a substitute for hearing aids. 
What about shipping fees and taxes?
All our perks will come with FREE SHIPPING. You will be responsible for paying import duties or taxes, if applicable, in your country or state.
Do MyAudioSession headphones come with a warranty?
MyAudioSession headphones come with a 30-day money back guarantee – be it comfort or sound, we will provide a full refund if there is anything you don’t like about the headphone. After 30 days, we will repair or replace any defective units at no cost for up to a year following delivery.

</h3>
<p>Vi DAC is a high performance digital to analog converter, or DAC, that connects to your home stereo.  Like its creators, it does things a little differently.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img border=""0"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://lhlabs.com/vi/images/vi-dac.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>A DAC is a device that converts digital data into glorious, analog audio.  Not all DAC's are created equal, and this one really has no equal.  Completely crowd-designed by our <a href=""http://lhlabs.com/force"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""color: blue;"" target=""_new"">Geek Force</a>, Vi DAC is also called Geek Soul.</p>
<h4 style=""margin-top:25px;color: #005d7a;line-height: 15px !important;margin-left:5px;"">No-Compromise Architecture That's Fully Balanced and Dual Mono<br/><img border=""0"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://lhlabs.com/vi/images/h4_border-bottom.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>
</h4>
<p style=""margin-left:5px;"">Vi DAC uses a fully balanced architecture throughout its entire circuit, which results in the best noise rejection possible, and is the most natural way to cancel distortion. In addition, it uses a dual mono design, implementing dual ESS Sabre DAC chips, a dual separated power supply and a dual analog output stage.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img border=""0"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://lhlabs.com/vi/images/vi_schematics.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 589.9694189602446px;height: 1060px;""/></p>

</h4>
<p style=""margin-left:5px;"">The Capacitor and Connector Exchange is a module that inserts into the back of Vi Tube DAC that allows you to swap out its output capacitors and connectors.  Basically, it's tube rolling... except it's with caps and connectors instead of tubes. All you have to do is follow a simple procedure that we'll provide you with, and you can swap in your favorite output cap/connector combination anytime without affecting your warranty.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:5px;"">We feel very strongly about CCX, and have decided to add it to every Vi Tube DAC.  It increases our cost, but doesn't affect your price. No matter which configuration of Vi Tube DAC you've chosen, CCX will be included.</p>
<ul style=""margin-left:5px;"">
<li>
<strong>Future Upgradeable</strong><br/>With CCX, your Vi Tube DAC is completely upgradeable.  If you don't want to commit to additional modules now, you can do it later.  The only risk is that the price for each module will be higher later.</li>
<li>
<strong>User Serviceable</strong><br/>CCX modules are easily swapped in and out.  All you have to do is power down your Vi Tube DAC, remove four screws, pull out one module, insert another, replace the four screws, and power up. </li>
</ul>
<h5 style=""margin-top:25px;color: #005d7a;line-height: 15px !important;margin-left:10px;"">Eight CCX Options<br/><img border=""0"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://lhlabs.com/vi/images/h5_border-bottom.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>

</h4>
<p style=""margin-left:5px;"">Vi DAC's versatility is unmatched.  It features five digital inputs: one USB, one TOSLINK, one AES/EBU, and two S/PDIF.  It outputs your analog music in two different ways.  First, it has two headphone outputs on the front panel.  One 1/4"" single-ended output, and one four pin XLR balanced output.  Second, it outputs at line level through one pair of RCA single ended outs and one pair of XLR balanced outs.  If you choose Vi DAC Tube, you'll get another pair of single-ended RCA outputs through the tube buffer stage. Additionally, if you choose the balanced tube output option, you'll get another pair of balanced XLR outputs.</p>

</h4>
<p style=""margin-left:5px;"">In the past, attempts to engineer digital volume attenuation has been panned by audiophiles due to its very obvious ""digital-ness.""  Analog volume control has been preferred, though it also presents a problem because of the noise that it generates.  We've taken a different approach to volume control with our advanced 64 bit attenuation circuit, which uses an ultra-high resolution, zero noise, bit perfect mechanism.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:5px;"">In the case of computer-based playback via USB, Vi DAC's volume attenuation circuit replaces the computer's volume calculations with its own, ensuring that your music remains bit perfect all the way through the conversion process.  This way, it ensures that no information is lost before Vi DAC gets the data.</p>

</h4>
<p style=""margin-left:5px;"">Most DAC aficionados understand the importance of digital filters.  One of the major functions of digital filters is to remove the digital artifacts that the digital-to-analog conversion process adds to the signal.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:5px;"">Vi DAC features several user-selectable digital modes that go beyond digital filtration.  These modes were developed specifically to Vi DAC (all of our products feature digital modes specific for their application even though they may share the same name product to product).  These modes not only change digital filtration settings, but also the digital PLL windows of the internal DAC IC, the re-clock jitter removal circuit, along with other hardware installed into the DAC.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:5px;"">Users get the benefit of continuous upgrades to their digital modes through firmware releases.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:5px;""><strong>TCM (Time Coherence Mode)</strong> uses LH Labs' minimum phase digital filter and time optimization algorithm, which removes all PRE-ring from the converted signal and realigns the impulse response. This presents the listener with a more well-defined and natural soundstage. In short, this mode is optimized for time domain response.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:5px;""><strong>FRM (Frequency Response Mode)</strong> uses a slow roll-off linear digital filter and frequency domain optimization algorithm to provide a smoother and clearer sound with even lower THD+N in the high frequencies. The IMD in the higher frequencies is lower because of frequency response and high frequency artifact optimization.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:5px;""><strong>FTM (Femto Time Mode)</strong> minimizes the bandwidth of the DAC IC's digital PLL, providing even better jitter performance and better sound quality. Available for ALL of our femto clock equipped DACs.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:5px;""><strong>SSM  (Stable Streaming Mode)</strong> is designed to optimize Vi DAC for streaming music. This mode combats two most important issues of streaming your music: time-fluctuated high jitter music content, and compressed roll off of high frequency harmonics. With SSM, Vi DAC will restore your streaming music's timing using our patent-pending three layer buffer. Expect a richer sound in the mid and high band frequency range.</p>

<p style=""margin-left:5px;"">Vi DAC decodes PCM (the most common music format, the one used in your CD's and MP3's) with bit rates of 16, 24, and 32 bits, and sample rates of 44.1 kHz, 48 kHz, 88.2 kHz, 96 kHz, 176.4 kHz, 192 kHz, 352.8 kHz, 384 kHz. It also natively decodes DSD music files (a rapidly-growing digital download format that audiophiles tend to love), letting you choose between five different filter modes, with sample rates of 2.822 MHz, 3.072 MHz, 5.644 MHz, 6.144 MHz, 11.288 MHz, and 12.288 MHz.</p>

</h4>
<p style=""margin-left:5px;"">When it comes to digital audio playback, timing is paramount.  The more accurate the timing, the more true to the original recording the playback is.  For the most accurate timing available, we turn to femto clocks.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:5px;""><img border=""0"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://lhlabs.com/vi/images/femtoclock_measurements.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""margin-left:5px;"">Femto clocks are so named because they are accurate to a femtosecond.  That's one millionth of one billionth of a second!  Clocks like these aren't typically found in audio devices.  They're usually in missile guidance systems.  If you can find a DAC with a femto clock in it, you're on the right track.  But the application of the clock (in our case more than one) is super important.  For example, if you choose a clock that's accurate to a femtosecond but the frequency at which is oscillates is not a whole number integer of the audio frequency you're decoding, you still end up with jitter, the sworn enemy of high-performance digital audio.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:5px;"">Our ultra-low jitter femto clocks are customized for us by Crystek Crystals, and are accurate to 85 femtoseconds when properly warmed up.  Each DAC that uses them requires two separate clocks.  One clock oscillates at 90.3168 MHz for audio signals that are sampled at a rate that is an integer multiple of 44.1 kHz, and the other oscillates at 98.304 MHz for audio signals that are sampled at a rate that is an integer multiple of 48 kHz.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:5px;"">Our proper implementation of dual femto clocks ensures that the lease amount of jitter is introduced into the digital audio signal prior to its conversion into analog.  The highest degree of harmonic integrity is retained, making the converted analog signal true to its digital origen. This translates to deep, black background, which gives the listener a sense of space and imaging that is unmatched in any DAC at any price.</p>

<p style=""margin-left:5px;"">Vi DAC's chassis has been designed to dissipate vibrations within the chassis that could otherwise be converted into electrical noise. By making a design without parallel walls, standing waves don't build up in corners, making it much less likely that noise will get into the circuit. This innovative design, based on our Da Vinci DAC's original chassis specification also creates enough internal volume to accommodate larger components such as capacitors and tubes. </p>

<p style=""margin-left:5px;"">A DAC has two main parts.  First, the digital stage, and then the analog stage.  Vi DAC's digital stage utilizes an advanced, proprietary solid-state design first implemented in our Da Vinci DAC.  In the digital stage, precision timing and decoding is the most challenging part. Without precision, details blur and smear.  The analog stage is where the magic happens. Vi DAC's solid-state analog stage is both musical and controlled at the same time.  We've also designed an optional tube output buffer for those afficionados that love the warm and liquid sound of tubes.</p>

</h3>
<p>Vi DAC is a continuation of the development of Geek Pulse, so it's natural to wonder what the difference is between the two.</p>
<p>Geek Pulse is a solid state DAC which has been optimized for desktop use.  It has a directly accessible volume attenuation knob on its front panel, along with up to two headphone outputs.  Because of space constraints, it has been built with a 12V DC power input, and can pair with our linear power supply, called Geek LPS.</p>
<p>Vi DAC is a versatile DAC that has been optimized for home stereo use; it fits perfectly into your audio furniture.  Designed for use with a remote control, it comes in either a solid state or a hybrid solid state/tube configuration.  With its elegant non-parallel wall design and bigger footprint than Geek Pulse, it takes its juice directly from either 120V or 240V AC power.</p>
<p>Technologically, Vi DAC is superior to Geek Pulse in the following ways, including others:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vi DAC uses a 15V bi-polar power supply in its DAC module, compared to Geek Pulse' 12V power.  The benefit is more headroom and 10% to 15% more power on the balanced headphone output.  Additionally, Vi DAC has a slightly better power supply rejection ratio in the negative leg of the power supply.</li>
<li>Vi DAC features an optional tube buffer stage, making it the most versatile DAC on the market.</li>
<li>Vi DAC features DSD Direct!</li>
<li>Vi DAC Tube features TWO pairs of single-ended and balanced output from solid state and also another TWO pairs of single-ended and balanced output from 6922/6DJ8 tubes (with optional balanced out from tube circuit).</li>

High Performance Portable Audio Player

 
Desktop Audio with No Equal




What is Vi DAC?

Vi DAC is a high performance digital to analog converter, or DAC, that connects to your home stereo.  Like its creators, it does things a little differently.

A DAC is a device that converts digital data into glorious, analog audio.  Not all DAC's are created equal, and this one really has no equal.  Completely crowd-designed by our Geek Force, Vi DAC is also called Geek Soul.
No-Compromise Architecture That's Fully Balanced and Dual Mono

Vi DAC uses a fully balanced architecture throughout its entire circuit, which results in the best noise rejection possible, and is the most natural way to cancel distortion. In addition, it uses a dual mono design, implementing dual ESS Sabre DAC chips, a dual separated power supply and a dual analog output stage.


Capacitor & Connector Exchange (CCX)

The Capacitor and Connector Exchange is a module that inserts into the back of Vi Tube DAC that allows you to swap out its output capacitors and connectors.  Basically, it's tube rolling... except it's with caps and connectors instead of tubes. All you have to do is follow a simple procedure that we'll provide you with, and you can swap in your favorite output cap/connector combination anytime without affecting your warranty.
We feel very strongly about CCX, and have decided to add it to every Vi Tube DAC.  It increases our cost, but doesn't affect your price. No matter which configuration of Vi Tube DAC you've chosen, CCX will be included.


Future UpgradeableWith CCX, your Vi Tube DAC is completely upgradeable.  If you don't want to commit to additional modules now, you can do it later.  The only risk is that the price for each module will be higher later.

User ServiceableCCX modules are easily swapped in and out.  All you have to do is power down your Vi Tube DAC, remove four screws, pull out one module, insert another, replace the four screws, and power up. 

Eight CCX Options



CCX #1: Included

Standard Single-ended Configuration—  This module comes standard with your Vi Tube DAC. It features Wima film capacitors and Switchcraft RCA connectors.


CCX #2: $479

Standard Balanced Configuration—  This module includes everything in the standard module plus a pair of Swedish-made Lundahl balanced output pransformers and a pair of Neutrik XLR output connectors. Backers of the Vi Tube Balanced Out Upgrade perk will receive this module, in addition to the CCX #1 module, automatically.



CCX #3: $179

Mundorf MCap Evo SilverGold.Oil Single-ended Configuration—  This module features a pair of Mundorf EVO - Silver / Gold + OilFilm Capacitors!  Our listening tests reveal a very transparent sound. It's a very ""precise-sounding"" capacitor for the kind of audiophile that enjoys a more ""Spectral/Wilson"" experience.


CCX #4: $658

Mundorf MCap Evo SilverGold.Oil Balanced Configuration—  This balanced module takes CCX #3, and adds a pair of Swedish-made Lundahl balanced output transformers and a pair of Neutrik XLR output connectors, bringing the noise floor even lower for a clearer image and more defined soundstage.


CCX #5: $189

Jupiter VT Series Film Single-ended Configuration—  Jupiter VT caps are known to be very sweet in the middle, which produces a classically warm, tubey sound.  Tube rollers will love this one.


CCX #6: $668

Jupiter VT Series Film Balanced Configuration—  This module takes the Jupiter VT silky sound, and lowers the noise floor with a pair of Lundahl balanced output transformers and Neutrik XLR output connectors.


CCX #7: $369

V-Cap TFTF + Cardas Single-ended Configuration—  This capacitor is known to be a magnifier of the strengths and weaknesses of the entire signal chain.  According to Larry, this is the best overall capacitor for this system.  You'll find that the soundstage will widen, heighten, and deepen, providing a much more intimate experience with your music.  Next, we've added Cardas ""Thick"" female connectors made of brass and plated with rhodium and silver.  Our experience is that this connector, in comparison to our standard Switchcraft connector, helps to provide a cleaner sound in the lower frequencies.


CCX #8: $888

V-Cap TFTF + Cardas Balanced Configuration—  This model adds Lundahl balanced output transpormers to the CCX #7 module.  It also employes Cardas Gold XLR connectors.  We use these connectors in our flagship products: Da Vinci and Sire DAC's.  We think they're the best XLR connectors on the market.


The World's Most Versatile DAC

Vi DAC's versatility is unmatched.  It features five digital inputs: one USB, one TOSLINK, one AES/EBU, and two S/PDIF.  It outputs your analog music in two different ways.  First, it has two headphone outputs on the front panel.  One 1/4"" single-ended output, and one four pin XLR balanced output.  Second, it outputs at line level through one pair of RCA single ended outs and one pair of XLR balanced outs.  If you choose Vi DAC Tube, you'll get another pair of single-ended RCA outputs through the tube buffer stage. Additionally, if you choose the balanced tube output option, you'll get another pair of balanced XLR outputs.
Advanced 64 Bit Volume Control

In the past, attempts to engineer digital volume attenuation has been panned by audiophiles due to its very obvious ""digital-ness.""  Analog volume control has been preferred, though it also presents a problem because of the noise that it generates.  We've taken a different approach to volume control with our advanced 64 bit attenuation circuit, which uses an ultra-high resolution, zero noise, bit perfect mechanism.
In the case of computer-based playback via USB, Vi DAC's volume attenuation circuit replaces the computer's volume calculations with its own, ensuring that your music remains bit perfect all the way through the conversion process.  This way, it ensures that no information is lost before Vi DAC gets the data.
Automatical Digital Volume Control Shut Off

If you want to use the analog volume control of your preamplifier,set Vi DAC's digital volume attenuation circuit  to -0dB, which completely bypasses the digital volume control circuit.
Individual Channel Control

In order to keep the digital music bit perfect, we've designed Vi DAC so that once it's volume is set to -0db, you can control the individual channels' attenuation settings to adjust balance.

User-Selectable Digital Modes



Most DAC aficionados understand the importance of digital filters.  One of the major functions of digital filters is to remove the digital artifacts that the digital-to-analog conversion process adds to the signal.
Vi DAC features several user-selectable digital modes that go beyond digital filtration.  These modes were developed specifically to Vi DAC (all of our products feature digital modes specific for their application even though they may share the same name product to product).  These modes not only change digital filtration settings, but also the digital PLL windows of the internal DAC IC, the re-clock jitter removal circuit, along with other hardware installed into the DAC.
Users get the benefit of continuous upgrades to their digital modes through firmware releases.
TCM (Time Coherence Mode) uses LH Labs' minimum phase digital filter and time optimization algorithm, which removes all PRE-ring from the converted signal and realigns the impulse response. This presents the listener with a more well-defined and natural soundstage. In short, this mode is optimized for time domain response.
FRM (Frequency Response Mode) uses a slow roll-off linear digital filter and frequency domain optimization algorithm to provide a smoother and clearer sound with even lower THD+N in the high frequencies. The IMD in the higher frequencies is lower because of frequency response and high frequency artifact optimization.
FTM (Femto Time Mode) minimizes the bandwidth of the DAC IC's digital PLL, providing even better jitter performance and better sound quality. Available for ALL of our femto clock equipped DACs.
SSM  (Stable Streaming Mode) is designed to optimize Vi DAC for streaming music. This mode combats two most important issues of streaming your music: time-fluctuated high jitter music content, and compressed roll off of high frequency harmonics. With SSM, Vi DAC will restore your streaming music's timing using our patent-pending three layer buffer. Expect a richer sound in the mid and high band frequency range.
Choose Your Music Format


Vi DAC decodes PCM (the most common music format, the one used in your CD's and MP3's) with bit rates of 16, 24, and 32 bits, and sample rates of 44.1 kHz, 48 kHz, 88.2 kHz, 96 kHz, 176.4 kHz, 192 kHz, 352.8 kHz, 384 kHz. It also natively decodes DSD music files (a rapidly-growing digital download format that audiophiles tend to love), letting you choose between five different filter modes, with sample rates of 2.822 MHz, 3.072 MHz, 5.644 MHz, 6.144 MHz, 11.288 MHz, and 12.288 MHz.
Dual Femtosecond Clocks

When it comes to digital audio playback, timing is paramount.  The more accurate the timing, the more true to the original recording the playback is.  For the most accurate timing available, we turn to femto clocks.

Femto clocks are so named because they are accurate to a femtosecond.  That's one millionth of one billionth of a second!  Clocks like these aren't typically found in audio devices.  They're usually in missile guidance systems.  If you can find a DAC with a femto clock in it, you're on the right track.  But the application of the clock (in our case more than one) is super important.  For example, if you choose a clock that's accurate to a femtosecond but the frequency at which is oscillates is not a whole number integer of the audio frequency you're decoding, you still end up with jitter, the sworn enemy of high-performance digital audio.
Our ultra-low jitter femto clocks are customized for us by Crystek Crystals, and are accurate to 85 femtoseconds when properly warmed up.  Each DAC that uses them requires two separate clocks.  One clock oscillates at 90.3168 MHz for audio signals that are sampled at a rate that is an integer multiple of 44.1 kHz, and the other oscillates at 98.304 MHz for audio signals that are sampled at a rate that is an integer multiple of 48 kHz.
Our proper implementation of dual femto clocks ensures that the lease amount of jitter is introduced into the digital audio signal prior to its conversion into analog.  The highest degree of harmonic integrity is retained, making the converted analog signal true to its digital origen. This translates to deep, black background, which gives the listener a sense of space and imaging that is unmatched in any DAC at any price.
Non Parallel Walls


Vi DAC's chassis has been designed to dissipate vibrations within the chassis that could otherwise be converted into electrical noise. By making a design without parallel walls, standing waves don't build up in corners, making it much less likely that noise will get into the circuit. This innovative design, based on our Da Vinci DAC's original chassis specification also creates enough internal volume to accommodate larger components such as capacitors and tubes. 
Descended from Da Vinci DAC


Ultra-quiet Linear Power Supply

Vi DAC's linear power supply employs 26 high quality regulators, including 4 discrete shunt regulators, making it among the quietest linear power in the industry.  In addition, the power circuit is completely isolated from the digital and analog circuits, preventing mechanical noise from the transformer from entering the signal path.
Proprietary Three Layer Elastic Buffer

To ensure computer speed fluctuations don't smear your music, we've developed a proprietary (and patent-pending) Three-Layer Buffer similar to the buffering technology many of today's high-speed computers employ. This is the first time such a design has been applied to audio.

Bipolar Instant Power Technology

To address the issue of energy during power hungry times, our output stage uses an extremely low output Z bi-polar power supply, which keeps at least twice the rated power in reserve just in case you want the cannons in Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture to feel like they're taking aim right at you.
Dual 2015 ESS SABRE9018AQ2M DAC Chips



Vi's DAC's design has always been to utilize ESS' Sabre 9018 DAC microchip for its digital to analog conversion.  New for 2015, ESS has released the 9018AQ2M, which boasts even better harmonic distortion characteristics than its predecessor, as well as a lower noise floor and greater dynamic range.  You have the option to utilize this new chip if you so choose.
For more info on ESS' new SABRE9018AQ2M, please click here.
Optional Hybrid solid-state/tube output buffer

A DAC has two main parts.  First, the digital stage, and then the analog stage.  Vi DAC's digital stage utilizes an advanced, proprietary solid-state design first implemented in our Da Vinci DAC.  In the digital stage, precision timing and decoding is the most challenging part. Without precision, details blur and smear.  The analog stage is where the magic happens. Vi DAC's solid-state analog stage is both musical and controlled at the same time.  We've also designed an optional tube output buffer for those afficionados that love the warm and liquid sound of tubes.
Put Analog Back Into Your Music


For so many of us, the drawback to listening to digital music is that is sounds too, well, digital. Vi DAC does a great job delivering both precision and warmth to your stereo, but if you really want to put analog back into your music, choosing the optional Tube output buffer is a must. It uses 6922/6DJ8 tubes to give you a very wide bandwidth, and a low noise floor. With its warm and charming characteristics, prepare to spend a lot more time listening to your music!

Vi DAC vs. Geek Pulse

Vi DAC is a continuation of the development of Geek Pulse, so it's natural to wonder what the difference is between the two.
Geek Pulse is a solid state DAC which has been optimized for desktop use.  It has a directly accessible volume attenuation knob on its front panel, along with up to two headphone outputs.  Because of space constraints, it has been built with a 12V DC power input, and can pair with our linear power supply, called Geek LPS.
Vi DAC is a versatile DAC that has been optimized for home stereo use; it fits perfectly into your audio furniture.  Designed for use with a remote control, it comes in either a solid state or a hybrid solid state/tube configuration.  With its elegant non-parallel wall design and bigger footprint than Geek Pulse, it takes its juice directly from either 120V or 240V AC power.
Technologically, Vi DAC is superior to Geek Pulse in the following ways, including others:

Vi DAC uses a 15V bi-polar power supply in its DAC module, compared to Geek Pulse' 12V power.  The benefit is more headroom and 10% to 15% more power on the balanced headphone output.  Additionally, Vi DAC has a slightly better power supply rejection ratio in the negative leg of the power supply.
Vi DAC features an optional tube buffer stage, making it the most versatile DAC on the market.
Vi DAC features DSD Direct!
Vi DAC Tube features TWO pairs of single-ended and balanced output from solid state and also another TWO pairs of single-ended and balanced output from 6922/6DJ8 tubes (with optional balanced out from tube circuit).

</div></div>","My Name Is                           LORD SU U AT NAM
I reached the state of
GOD-Consciousness on 2/24/07 after more than 30 years of Spiritual Training on
the Path of Eckankar, The Ancient Science of Soul Travel.
I learned to gather myself as Awareness
and leave the Physical body through the Crown Chakra to explore the Heavenly
Worlds in full Consciousness.
On 1/1/08 I left Eckankar with my
Teachers Blessings, to bring my own Teaching to this World; It is named;      ~    THE SU U TEMPLE OF BEING    ~ And teaches that GOD Only Makes GODS. Sounds strange? Well its not…The
truth is YOU ARE A GOD IN
TRAINING.
When you were first born, high in the
Heavenly Worlds and sent into the Worlds of Darkness for Spiritual Training, it
was expected that you someday return to the Heavenly Worlds in the
GOD-Conscious State to help expand the Spiritual Universes.
But, how many of you can actually see
yourself as Zeus, Odin, Buddha, Allah, Krishna, Jehovah or Jesus…too much of a
stretch? 
Well consider this…each one of these
Beings was at the same place in consciousness as you, at some point in their
past lives.
So…what about you; where do you sit? How far have
you traveled up the Spiritual Ladder, to become the Holy Spirit Itself…which is
your True state of Consciousness?
The truth is, most Souls have no idea
of where they are Spiritually, compared to GODS expectation of them; and
without this knowledge, they’re shooting in the dark, driving without directions
to some unknown Spiritual destination.      I Have The Spiritual Attainment Required To Lift Souls       From The Human States Into The Higher States Of Spiritual Consciousness, Even Into The GOD-Realized States Of Being.          And will do so utilizing the very best Internet Technology for Online Training; My Writings, ""Ten Steps To Perfection""; My books, ""You Are A GOD In Training"" and ""GOD Only Makes GODS""; My Music, ""Transformational Music From The Heavenly Worlds"" (I am also an Orchestral Composer); A variety of personal appearances; My ability to be with all of my students at the same time (wherever they may be); and whatever else is necessary to get the message out.

<h2>Vokyl Erupt: Gaming Audio Redefined</h2>
<p>Vokyl is a gaming audio brand passionate about high quality sound. We’ve seen up close the attention to detail audio engineers put into titles, and we are bringing the same dedication to our first headset, Erupt. With Erupt, Vokyl delivers a ready-to-play analog solution for immersive experiences, competitive gaming, and clear chat. No LEDs. No digital frills. Only the accurate, crystal clear sound that for years has been missing from mainstream gaming audio products. </p>
<p>We believe gamers should be able to use their console and PC features to the fullest without compromising their preferences or making hardware modifications. By making Erupt analog we put you, the listener, in control of your sound. </p>
<p>Vokyl focuses on quality above all else. Designed, machined, and assembled in St. Louis, Missouri, Erupt, with its CNC-milled aluminum chassis, is the new gold standard in build quality and dependability. </p>

<h2><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://vokyligg.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media_graphic.jpg"" src=""""/></h2>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>Why The Erupt?</h2>
<h3>Success through Simplicity</h3>
<p>The user experience should be as simple and straightforward as possible, providing the best clarity and sound with minimal interference. By not altering the signal with DSPs or active circuity, Erupt preserves the gameplay sound the title’s engineers carefully designed. If desired, a 3D software option of your choosing can be added, but we wanted to keep that choice for you, the listener.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://vokyligg.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/overview.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Before we decided to build Erupt, we spent years using every solution on the market: high-end headsets with 3rd-party peripheral boom or desktop USB mics, wireless headsets, and lackluster all-in-one solutions. Not a single one gave us the audio experience we wanted, so we set out to build one that did.  Erupt, a simple, one wire solution. No dongles or add-ons. No batteries to charge.</p>
<h3>Customizable Comfort</h3>
<p>We designed Erupt for marathon raid and grinding sessions where comfort is essential. The two key elements of a comfortable headset are where it touches your skull: the earpads and headband. Our super soft suspension headband fits your head automatically. The slim profile means no unnecessary bulk or weight.</p>
<p>Erupt’s earpads have been ergonomically designed for both optimal comfort and sound quality. Each pad option has been optimized for acoustic airflow. The vented option delivers a linear, quick, and wide soundstage. The solid option delivers a more isolated, dynamic experience. The listener can adjust the earpad to match the specific subjective preference and environment.</p>
<p><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://vokyligg.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/comfort.jpg"" src=""""/> ​</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Headphone Drivers &amp; Microphones</h3>
<p>Most current headset manufacturers are all using the same, inexpensive driver style: 40mm neodymium. This ubiquitous driver is as common as it is mediocre.</p>
<p>We wanted something different. Our team decided to start from scratch, designing a driver from the ground up using aluminum magnesium, a well-kept secret from the high-end audio world.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://vokyligg.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/Al-Mg%20Drivers.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Vokyl carefully designed our proprietary Al-Mg driver for optimal dynamic driver performance. We utilized a thick rubber surround to isolate the membrane, creating a sonic surface that vibrates singularly on its own, without influence from surrounding components. Finding the proper stiffness for the surround to match with the Al-Mg material brought about optimal resonance for a natural, punchy, and engaging tone.</p>
<p>To round out the driver, we used heavy (relative to drivers) and powerful N50 neodymium magnets stacked on each other to provide sound with weight, substance, and texture that will leave you listening just for the fun of it.</p>
<p>Vokyl chose the larger, 50mm size for the perfect balance between a large encompassing sound and low distortion. This optimal surface size decreases standing waves which can disrupt your experience.</p>
<p>Airflow is optimized with a multi-pore system that lets air uniformly enter and exit the driver chamber, allowing us to dampen the headphone to a specific, desired tuning.<br/> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://vokyligg.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/cup_design.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The drivers themselves are protected and secured by lightweight aluminum cups machined here in our shop in St. Louis, Missouri. The drivers are placed in an angular housing for a natural sound experience and a massive soundstage.</p>
<p>By using stiff aluminum housing with a specific damping scheme for our semi-open design, we have created the Erupt to have the utmost in dynamic range, smoothness, and spatial clarity. We also chose an acoustic fabric to provide just the right amount of internal damping and airflow, with our airflow system designed to get the most from our proprietary Al-Mg drivers. <br/>Erupt truly brings the most out of movies, music, and gaming.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://vokyligg.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/Mics%20Infographic.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>While Erupt’s drivers make it a great choice for games, music, and movies, the mic setup is just as unique. This boom mic is fully detachable, mutable, and houses two separate microphones that the user can toggle on the fly.</p>
<p>The unidirectional, noise-cancelling mic is great for louder, chaotic environments. The omnidirectional mic is perfect for quieter spaces and the best choice for studio quality chat.</p>
<p> </p>

<h2> </h2>
<h2>The Vokyl Team &amp; Our Story</h2>
<p>While we’ve all worked in the audio industry for the better part of a decade, Erupt’s journey began in 2016 after one of us bought a headset for our Playstation, and another, and then another, until we realized that there was literally nothing out there that had truly hi-fi grade sound, a mic, and great design.</p>
<p>We’ve come a long way since firing shots at each other in Battlefield 4 to where we are today, building the Erupt. We’ve spent many long days and nights refining every aspect of the headset, from the industrial design to the fitment to the sound quality, all down to the smallest detail. We believe Erupt will profoundly change your gaming experience. That’s why we built it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://vokyligg.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/Fam.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our founders have been working together for years to bring audio hardware to market, landing in publications like GQ, CNET, and Design Milk. We see the Erupt as our next chapter and invite you to join us on this adventure.</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h2>What We Need &amp; Our Timeline</h2>
<p>We’ve completed all the designing, prototyping, 3D printing, machining, testing, listening, and gaming we need to. This headset is ready to be made. Your funds will be used exclusively on only what’s needed to get Erupt out the door and on to your head.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Here's where your funding will be going...</strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<h3>Molds / Tooling</h3>
<p>We need to purchase tooling for the headband attachment, driver housing, and earpad clip. We are currently using 3D prints in place of these parts.

<h2>FAQs</h2>
<p><strong>Is the Vokyl Erupt designed for the Switch, Xbox One, PS4, or mobile?</strong></p>
<p>Yes! The switch uses a completely analog signal, so you can use it for any one of these things. We will say that you will need an adapter if your phone does not have a headphone jack :(</p>
<p><strong>Is the Erupt just for gaming?</strong></p>
<p>No! We designed the Erupt to be your new audio secret weapon, your Jose Oquendo. It will give you a fantastic headphone experience whether you use it for gaming, movies, or music.</p>
<p><strong>What about surround sound?</strong></p>
<p>You probably see our headset and are thinking “Wow the Vokyl guys are a bunch of surround sound haters”. We don’t hate surround sound. We love surround sound. We think that surround sound is awesome. We just think that it's best delivery method for headphones is software, not hardware. Engineers put a lot of work into in-game sound design and there's some great free surround software out there, so we encourage you to use those options with your Erupt headset.</p>
<p><strong>What if I have a studio/desktop mic?</strong></p>
<p>Great! Desktop mics are top quality gear. Simply detach your boom mic from the Erupt headset and you’re good to go! You’ll use the Erupt as a pair of headphones and your mic as you always have.</p>
<p><strong>What if I have a headphone amp and/or DAC?</strong></p>
<p>Ooh you know what you’re doing. This is probably the best way to use the Erupt. For headphone use, you’ll use the Erupt via whatever output your amp has. For headset use, you’ll need a splitter to utilize your amp/sound card’s mic input.</p>
<p><strong>I wear glasses, will this headset crush my temples?</strong></p>
<p>While no one on the Vokyl team is a nerd with corrective eyewear, we have heard from several nerds that these are some of the most comfortable headphones they’ve worn with their glasses.</p>
<p><strong>What if my Erupt breaks?!</strong></p>
<p>Take a deep breath, it’s going to be okay. All of our assembly, testing, designing, engineering, machining, and laundry is done at our St. Louis facility. So, while we don’t have a set in stone return policy up and running just yet, shoot us an email and odds are we’ll just take it back in the nest and make it good as new.</p>
</div></div>","Vokyl Erupt: Gaming Audio Redefined
Vokyl is a gaming audio brand passionate about high quality sound. We’ve seen up close the attention to detail audio engineers put into titles, and we are bringing the same dedication to our first headset, Erupt. With Erupt, Vokyl delivers a ready-to-play analog solution for immersive experiences, competitive gaming, and clear chat. No LEDs. No digital frills. Only the accurate, crystal clear sound that for years has been missing from mainstream gaming audio products. 
We believe gamers should be able to use their console and PC features to the fullest without compromising their preferences or making hardware modifications. By making Erupt analog we put you, the listener, in control of your sound. 
Vokyl focuses on quality above all else. Designed, machined, and assembled in St. Louis, Missouri, Erupt, with its CNC-milled aluminum chassis, is the new gold standard in build quality and dependability. 





 
Why The Erupt?
Success through Simplicity
The user experience should be as simple and straightforward as possible, providing the best clarity and sound with minimal interference. By not altering the signal with DSPs or active circuity, Erupt preserves the gameplay sound the title’s engineers carefully designed. If desired, a 3D software option of your choosing can be added, but we wanted to keep that choice for you, the listener.

Before we decided to build Erupt, we spent years using every solution on the market: high-end headsets with 3rd-party peripheral boom or desktop USB mics, wireless headsets, and lackluster all-in-one solutions. Not a single one gave us the audio experience we wanted, so we set out to build one that did.  Erupt, a simple, one wire solution. No dongles or add-ons. No batteries to charge.
Customizable Comfort
We designed Erupt for marathon raid and grinding sessions where comfort is essential. The two key elements of a comfortable headset are where it touches your skull: the earpads and headband. Our super soft suspension headband fits your head automatically. The slim profile means no unnecessary bulk or weight.
Erupt’s earpads have been ergonomically designed for both optimal comfort and sound quality. Each pad option has been optimized for acoustic airflow. The vented option delivers a linear, quick, and wide soundstage. The solid option delivers a more isolated, dynamic experience. The listener can adjust the earpad to match the specific subjective preference and environment.
 ​

Headphone Drivers & Microphones
Most current headset manufacturers are all using the same, inexpensive driver style: 40mm neodymium. This ubiquitous driver is as common as it is mediocre.
We wanted something different. Our team decided to start from scratch, designing a driver from the ground up using aluminum magnesium, a well-kept secret from the high-end audio world.

Vokyl carefully designed our proprietary Al-Mg driver for optimal dynamic driver performance. We utilized a thick rubber surround to isolate the membrane, creating a sonic surface that vibrates singularly on its own, without influence from surrounding components. Finding the proper stiffness for the surround to match with the Al-Mg material brought about optimal resonance for a natural, punchy, and engaging tone.
To round out the driver, we used heavy (relative to drivers) and powerful N50 neodymium magnets stacked on each other to provide sound with weight, substance, and texture that will leave you listening just for the fun of it.
Vokyl chose the larger, 50mm size for the perfect balance between a large encompassing sound and low distortion. This optimal surface size decreases standing waves which can disrupt your experience.
Airflow is optimized with a multi-pore system that lets air uniformly enter and exit the driver chamber, allowing us to dampen the headphone to a specific, desired tuning. 

 
The drivers themselves are protected and secured by lightweight aluminum cups machined here in our shop in St. Louis, Missouri. The drivers are placed in an angular housing for a natural sound experience and a massive soundstage.
By using stiff aluminum housing with a specific damping scheme for our semi-open design, we have created the Erupt to have the utmost in dynamic range, smoothness, and spatial clarity. We also chose an acoustic fabric to provide just the right amount of internal damping and airflow, with our airflow system designed to get the most from our proprietary Al-Mg drivers. Erupt truly brings the most out of movies, music, and gaming.

 
While Erupt’s drivers make it a great choice for games, music, and movies, the mic setup is just as unique. This boom mic is fully detachable, mutable, and houses two separate microphones that the user can toggle on the fly.
The unidirectional, noise-cancelling mic is great for louder, chaotic environments. The omnidirectional mic is perfect for quieter spaces and the best choice for studio quality chat.

The Vokyl Team & Our Story
While we’ve all worked in the audio industry for the better part of a decade, Erupt’s journey began in 2016 after one of us bought a headset for our Playstation, and another, and then another, until we realized that there was literally nothing out there that had truly hi-fi grade sound, a mic, and great design.
We’ve come a long way since firing shots at each other in Battlefield 4 to where we are today, building the Erupt. We’ve spent many long days and nights refining every aspect of the headset, from the industrial design to the fitment to the sound quality, all down to the smallest detail. We believe Erupt will profoundly change your gaming experience. That’s why we built it.
 

 
Our founders have been working together for years to bring audio hardware to market, landing in publications like GQ, CNET, and Design Milk. We see the Erupt as our next chapter and invite you to join us on this adventure.

 
What We Need & Our Timeline
We’ve completed all the designing, prototyping, 3D printing, machining, testing, listening, and gaming we need to. This headset is ready to be made. Your funds will be used exclusively on only what’s needed to get Erupt out the door and on to your head.
 
Here's where your funding will be going...
 
Molds / Tooling
We need to purchase tooling for the headband attachment, driver housing, and earpad clip. We are currently using 3D prints in place of these parts. The prints have been helpful and necessary for prototyping and testing purposes. However, they aren’t a scalable solution. Your backing will provide us with the funds to cover the tooling and mold costs of these parts. While a one-time cost, tooling is the most expensive part of our production equation and where we need your help the most.
Drivers
The good news? Our custom drivers are rockin’ and ready to go. The bad news? We don’t have the funds to build enough of them. With your backing, we will be able to have our proprietary Al-Mg drivers produced at scale.
 

 
Raw Materials
As good of machinists as we are, the Vokyl team can’t mill headphone cups and yokes out of thin air. We need to order aluminum stock, which is most economically done in bulk. Your support will help us get the best price possible and ensure these headsets are built and delivered at a brisk pace.

Why are some perks cheaper?</i></p><p>Modal Electronics Ltd is a European VAT registered company. Therefore, by law, we are required to sell and advertise our products including European VAT for residents of those countries within the European Union. We have created separate perk levels for those not within the EU that do not have VAT included but please be aware you may be charged taxes upon importation by your local / national authorities. This is beyond the control of Modal Electronics Limited.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><i>Why does the perk I want not ship to the country I live in?</i></p><p>If you are outside the specified countries for a specific perk you would like to purchase please let us know and we will add your country to the list.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><i>What’s in the box?</i></p><p>1 x Modal Electronics SKULPT synthesiser <br/>1 x Modal Electronics SKULPT lid / cover <br/>1 x Micro USB cable</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><i>What interfaces does SKULPT have?</i></p><p>- Stereo audio out 3.5mm jack <br/>- Dedicated headphones 3.5mm jack <br/>- USB Micro for Class Compliant MIDI and power <br/>- MIDI 5-pin DIN In and Out <br/>- Analogue clock sync In and Out 3.5mm jacks</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><i>What kind of USB connector does SKULPT use?</i></p><p>SKULPT uses a USB Micro connector for Class Compliant MIDI and power</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><i>Does SKULPT have a built in speaker?</i></p><p>No.</p><p>There are two audio out ports on SKULPT: <br/>- Stereo audio out 3.5mm jack <br/>- Dedicated headphones 3.5mm jack</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><i>What software / hardware do I need to use SKULPT?</i></p><p>SKULPT is a standalone hardware instrument that only requires headphones or line-out to speakers to be used. </p><p>SKULPT also has an optional free software editor - that runs on macOS, Windows, iOS and Android - that provides you with larger format visual editing, if desired.</p><p>SKULPT is also MIDI compatible and can be connected to external MIDI hardware / software via MIDI-DIN ports or USB (as a Class Compliant USB MIDI device), allowing it to be controlled by the majority of MIDI keyboards, controllers, and DAWs. </p><p>SKULPT also has analogue clock sync ports for syncing with certain other devices and modular synth systems.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><i>What features does the MODALapp provide? Do I need to use the app to use SKULPT?</i></p><p>MODALapp is an optional free software editor for SKULPT that runs on macOS, Windows, iOS and Android.</p><p>It includes the following features: <br/>- Full editor with visual representation of all controls including sequencer and animator <br/>- Visual representation of the Mod Slots modulation matrix <br/>- Librarian functionality for patches and sequences <br/>- Additional utility settings such as MIDI filtering and MIDI routing</p><p>The software editor is completely optional and not required to use any of SKULPT synthesiser's sound engine.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><i>Can I connect multiple SKULPT’s to the same computer?</i></p><p>Yes. </p><p>In this situation each SKULPT will appear as a separate USB-MIDI device, and if using MODALapp each SKULPT will be accessible via it's own tab on the UI.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><i>Is SKULPT polyphonic, paraphonic or monophonic?</i></p><p>SKULPT is polyphonic - it has four voices of true polyphony.</p><p>Each voice is made up of eight oscillators, and using SKULPT's Voice Mode patch parameter this can be configured in three different ways: <br/>- poly: one note plays one voice <br/>- duo: one note plays a two voice stack <br/>- mono: one note plays a four voice stack</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><i>Does SKULPT have Frequency Modulation (FM) capabilities?</i></p><p>Yes - the SKULPT FM parameter sets wave 2 to modulate wave 1.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><i>Does SKULPT support velocity, aftertouch or MPE?</i></p><p>The SKULPT touch keyboard does not provide key velocity or aftertouch, however Velocity and Aftertouch from MIDI-in are two of the eight modulation sources on SKULPT that can modulate 37 destinations through an 8 slot modulation matrix.</p><p>SKULPT does not currently support MPE (MIDI Polyphonic Expression), however it is under consideration for a future update as we have already implemented MPE into the Modal 002/001/002R.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><i>Can I play more than one note simultaneously on the touch keyboard?</i></p><p>Yes.</p><p>The touch keyboard on SKULPT is fully multitouch and allows you to play all 4 voices of SKULPT simultaneously. If using SKULPT as a MIDI keyboard it is possible to transmit notes from all 16 keys at the same time.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><i>Does SKULPT have MIDI thru?</i></p><p>Yes.</p><p>SKULPT is designed to live in a big MIDI setup, so it has a 'soft' MIDI Thru that can be enabled in software. There are two MIDI Thru options: <br/>1. DIN Thru: DIN-In -&gt; DIN-Out <br/>2. USB Thru: USB-In -&gt; DIN-Out &amp; DIN-In -&gt; USB-Out</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><i>What standard does the SKULPT analogue clock sync In and Out use?</i></p><p>The SKULPT analogue clock sync in and out are configured to the KORG / Teenage Engineering specification.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><i>What batteries does the SKULPT take and how long will the power it for?</i></p><p>If wanting to power SKULPT by batteries instead of USB, it will require 6 AA batteries (sold separately).</p><p>There are several variables that determine how longer the batteries will last for including the quality &amp; condition of battery cells used, environmental factors such as the ambient temperature (which seriously effects alkaline cells), how much the keyboard is used, whether MIDI and USB are being used, headphones vs. line out etc. But so far we are seeing at least 12 hours of play time in a nominal testing environment. We intend to conduct more extensive battery tests over the course of the campaign.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><i>Are there any functionality differences between the white and black SKULPT's?</i></p><p>No - the finish colour is the only difference.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><i>What is the manufacturer’s warranty on Modal SKULPT?</i></p><p>Modal offers a one year warranty against manufacturing defects on a return to service centre basis.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><i>How long will it take for you to deliver my SKULPT?</i></p><p>We are estimating to ship all SKULPT's to backers by November 2018, shipping to Kickstarter backers first followed by Indiegogo InDemand backers.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><i>Is SKULPT a kit synthesiser, like the Modal CRAFTsynth?</i></p><p>No. </p><p>SKULPT is delivered as a fully working unit.

About Modal Electronics
We are a team of developers, designers and musicians who design and manufacture electronic musical instruments, based in Bristol, UK.Modal 002R, 002, 008 and 001 Established in 2013, we have previously released a range of highly regarded instruments such as Modal 002 - the fully-multitimbral 12 voice digital/analogue hybrids synthesiser, Modal 008 - the 8 voice analogue powerhouse synthesiser and the Modal CRAFT range - synthesiser and drum sampler kits that broke new ground in price vs performance.Modal CRAFTsynth and CRAFTapp We make 'Machines for Musicians'www.modalelectronics.com  Partners Almond Design Studio""It is the purpose of design to give character and identity to what is otherwise an inanimate object. It is to allow a product to explain itself to the user; to generate a joy in its use and impart pleasure in its ownership.""Trained in Product Design at the Royal College of Art, London, John Almond's award winning practice has been a forerunner in the use of computer aided design techniques since their inception. His work is now predominently in the area of high technology products, and has worked for clients that include Virgin, Sharp, Citizen, Hitachi, Mitsubishi, Atomos, Pace and IBM. He worked with Nokia in Finland for 6 years on their corporate design programs, and has been a regular visiting lecturer on MA Product Design courses both at the Royal College of Art and at Manchester Metropolitan University.www.almond.uk.com  Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ): Why is Modal using Indiegogo InDemand?Modal has over the past four years sold it's products through a number of dealers around the World and we do not see this changing. However, Modal is always looking for new ways to help customers get access to our products and like many other established companies, Modal sees new channels such as Indiegogo and Kickstarter as new, fresh and innovative ways of reaching people the World over – often in countries where it’s traditionally been hard or impossible to buy Modal products.Following our incredibly successful Kickstarter campaign, we’ve received so many requests to purchase SKULPT from people who missed out on the original Kickstarter campaign – and so we’ve launched this Indiegogo InDemand campaign to help people pre-order from production, after the Kickstarter units are delivered.  Why are SKULPT perks different prices for different countries? Why are some perks cheaper?Modal Electronics Ltd is a European VAT registered company. Therefore, by law, we are required to sell and advertise our products including European VAT for residents of those countries within the European Union. We have created separate perk levels for those not within the EU that do not have VAT included but please be aware you may be charged taxes upon importation by your local / national authorities. This is beyond the control of Modal Electronics Limited.  Why does the perk I want not ship to the country I live in?If you are outside the specified countries for a specific perk you would like to purchase please let us know and we will add your country to the list.  What’s in the box?1 x Modal Electronics SKULPT synthesiser 1 x Modal Electronics SKULPT lid / cover 1 x Micro USB cable  What interfaces does SKULPT have?- Stereo audio out 3.5mm jack - Dedicated headphones 3.5mm jack - USB Micro for Class Compliant MIDI and power - MIDI 5-pin DIN In and Out - Analogue clock sync In and Out 3.5mm jacks  What kind of USB connector does SKULPT use?SKULPT uses a USB Micro connector for Class Compliant MIDI and power  Does SKULPT have a built in speaker?No.There are two audio out ports on SKULPT: - Stereo audio out 3.5mm jack - Dedicated headphones 3.5mm jack  What software / hardware do I need to use SKULPT?SKULPT is a standalone hardware instrument that only requires headphones or line-out to speakers to be used. SKULPT also has an optional free software editor - that runs on macOS, Windows, iOS and Android - that provides you with larger format visual editing, if desired.SKULPT is also MIDI compatible and can be connected to external MIDI hardware / software via MIDI-DIN ports or USB (as a Class Compliant USB MIDI device), allowing it to be controlled by the majority of MIDI keyboards, controllers, and DAWs. SKULPT also has analogue clock sync ports for syncing with certain other devices and modular synth systems.  What features does the MODALapp provide? Do I need to use the app to use SKULPT?MODALapp is an optional free software editor for SKULPT that runs on macOS, Windows, iOS and Android.It includes the following features: - Full editor with visual representation of all controls including sequencer and animator - Visual representation of the Mod Slots modulation matrix - Librarian functionality for patches and sequences - Additional utility settings such as MIDI filtering and MIDI routingThe software editor is completely optional and not required to use any of SKULPT synthesiser's sound engine.  Can I connect multiple SKULPT’s to the same computer?Yes. In this situation each SKULPT will appear as a separate USB-MIDI device, and if using MODALapp each SKULPT will be accessible via it's own tab on the UI.  Is SKULPT polyphonic, paraphonic or monophonic?SKULPT is polyphonic - it has four voices of true polyphony.Each voice is made up of eight oscillators, and using SKULPT's Voice Mode patch parameter this can be configured in three different ways: - poly: one note plays one voice - duo: one note plays a two voice stack - mono: one note plays a four voice stack  Does SKULPT have Frequency Modulation (FM) capabilities?Yes - the SKULPT FM parameter sets wave 2 to modulate wave 1.  Does SKULPT support velocity, aftertouch or MPE?The SKULPT touch keyboard does not provide key velocity or aftertouch, however Velocity and Aftertouch from MIDI-in are two of the eight modulation sources on SKULPT that can modulate 37 destinations through an 8 slot modulation matrix.SKULPT does not currently support MPE (MIDI Polyphonic Expression), however it is under consideration for a future update as we have already implemented MPE into the Modal 002/001/002R.  Can I play more than one note simultaneously on the touch keyboard?Yes.The touch keyboard on SKULPT is fully multitouch and allows you to play all 4 voices of SKULPT simultaneously. If using SKULPT as a MIDI keyboard it is possible to transmit notes from all 16 keys at the same time.  Does SKULPT have MIDI thru?Yes.SKULPT is designed to live in a big MIDI setup, so it has a 'soft' MIDI Thru that can be enabled in software. There are two MIDI Thru options: 1. DIN Thru: DIN-In -> DIN-Out 2. USB Thru: USB-In -> DIN-Out & DIN-In -> USB-Out  What standard does the SKULPT analogue clock sync In and Out use?The SKULPT analogue clock sync in and out are configured to the KORG / Teenage Engineering specification.  What batteries does the SKULPT take and how long will the power it for?If wanting to power SKULPT by batteries instead of USB, it will require 6 AA batteries (sold separately).There are several variables that determine how longer the batteries will last for including the quality & condition of battery cells used, environmental factors such as the ambient temperature (which seriously effects alkaline cells), how much the keyboard is used, whether MIDI and USB are being used, headphones vs. line out etc. But so far we are seeing at least 12 hours of play time in a nominal testing environment. We intend to conduct more extensive battery tests over the course of the campaign.  Are there any functionality differences between the white and black SKULPT's?No - the finish colour is the only difference.  What is the manufacturer’s warranty on Modal SKULPT?Modal offers a one year warranty against manufacturing defects on a return to service centre basis.  How long will it take for you to deliver my SKULPT?We are estimating to ship all SKULPT's to backers by November 2018, shipping to Kickstarter backers first followed by Indiegogo InDemand backers.  Is SKULPT a kit synthesiser, like the Modal CRAFTsynth?No. SKULPT is delivered as a fully working unit. Simply plug into a USB port on your computer or install AA batteries, plug in headphones or connect to your mixer or audio interface, and start making music straight away.",28.0,13,"1 Campaign

Compared to in-ear headphones the ears stay completely free, enabling a safe way of staying connected while on the go.  Accept an incoming call - swipe backwards Turn on your music with One Tap

 Get directions without looking at your phone screen    The integrated touchzone is setup to access everything without ever taking the phone out of your pocket. Connectivity at the touch of a button. Consuming digital information on the go is a form of distraction but with Voxos it becomes part of the human senses.    Bone Conduction - the process by which sound waves are transmitted to the inner ear by the cranial bones without traveling through the air in the ear canal.The bone conduction system offers key safety advantages over traditional earphones, by leaving the user's ears “free” so that they are not distracted from their environment.   We'll provide you with the type of lense you need, chose from the following options.    Apart from launching a device that is fashionable and can be used by anyone that wants to stay connected while on the go, the team at Voxos is also focussed on making a difference and having an impact by working with organisations in different areas.We have partnered with Hearology, a company that is redefining the ‘Audiology’ industry, to identify how we can help patients with hearing deficiencies. Together we have seen how Voxos provides relief to people with Tinnitus, a condition experienced by 5% of the global adult population.

Ask anyone who has ever built their own home or tackled a major home renovation. The biggest risk you are taking here is that the project could take longer than originally planned. However, since your contribution prices are locked-in now, you are NOT taking a cost risk - we are. If we overshoot our cost target (and many projects do) you will not be asked to make another contribution. But, if we experience an unforeseen delay (and many projects do), you may have to wait a little longer to receive your M24s. We will do our very best to minimize any delays to the project, but there is always the possibility that SOMETHING can and likely will cause a delay. Our deepblue2 project was delayed by a month due to additional development time being needed (that's on us) and port labor issues along the US west coast (not under our control) that caused shipping delays. We had planned to begin shipping the deepblue2 in November and ended up shipping most of them in December. These things happen. On the flip side, this is not our first rodeo. We've been designing and building products for nearly a decade now, so we have the right processes and people in place to help ensure success. It is simply that there are variables that we have little direct control over, so we appreciate your understanding. </p></div>","From the Decco to the M24Ten years ago Peachtree Audio recognized that music lovers were assembling great music collections on their computers.

The deepblue2 began shipping at the end of 2014 and has become one of our best-reviewed and best-selling products of all time!Risks & ChallengesAs with any project, there are always schedule and cost risks. Ask anyone who has ever built their own home or tackled a major home renovation. The biggest risk you are taking here is that the project could take longer than originally planned. However, since your contribution prices are locked-in now, you are NOT taking a cost risk - we are. If we overshoot our cost target (and many projects do) you will not be asked to make another contribution. But, if we experience an unforeseen delay (and many projects do), you may have to wait a little longer to receive your M24s. We will do our very best to minimize any delays to the project, but there is always the possibility that SOMETHING can and likely will cause a delay. Our deepblue2 project was delayed by a month due to additional development time being needed (that's on us) and port labor issues along the US west coast (not under our control) that caused shipping delays. We had planned to begin shipping the deepblue2 in November and ended up shipping most of them in December. These things happen. On the flip side, this is not our first rodeo. We've been designing and building products for nearly a decade now, so we have the right processes and people in place to help ensure success. It is simply that there are variables that we have little direct control over, so we appreciate your understanding.",12.0,0,"2 Campaigns

With four parts that can play up to 8 synths, you can make fantastic electronic music, such as soundscapes, electronica, ambient, electro, or  techno to name a few.  Whether noodling in your music space after work or jamming with friends, The NDLR can take your music to amazing places!</p><p><strong>The Four Parts</strong></p><p>You get 2 Motifs, which are complex sequenced arpeggiators, a polyphonic Pad part and a Drone part. Each part can be started/paused individually. Point each part to MIDI synth modules, multitimbral synths or soft-synths of your choice.</p><p><strong>The PAD</strong></p><p>The PAD part is a polyphonic part ideal for pad type synth patches. Press one of the 7 chord buttons and hear beutiful PADs on your favorite poly synth. The Pad, as with all of the parts change notes to match the selected Key, Mode, Chord and Chord type. When you press a chord button the notes stay on until you press the next chord or stop the part, so you can twist knobs on your synths or play a lead part on guitar. Change the chord octave position, strum mode, range, and spread. <br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1579828091/qjqmietufpwsy90hilaj.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>There are two ""Motifs"" which are extremely versatile sequenced arpeggiators.

CreditsSteve and Darryl are veterans of the hi-tech industry, with over 50 years of combined experience in product development. We’ve worked on projects ranging from audio/video codecs, residential gateways and routers, cloud security services, to wireless display technology. Having taken early retirement, we are now following our passion and working full time on building a business around our synthesizer habit. Steve is an EE that studied music theory which is being put to good use here. However, a project like this takes a lot of work and expertise and we've been lucky to have a network of “Really Smart Friends” who are assisting us:

Paul has been a lead electrical engineer for a musical instrument company for over 20 years. He made an analog synth while in high school and has a complete recording studio in his house! He is beta testing, advising on the electrical design and helping with the PCB layout. The NDLR would likely be the simplest thing he’s ever worked on.

Ben is a veteran mechanical engineer, and is helping with mechanical drawings and advising on best practices for manufacturing. His best advise? Keep it simple, so we did!

Kelly the G-code man made the prototype plexiglass faceplates on his CNC router and the production LCD screen protectors with the addition of a Glowforge laser cutter. Now he's also making NDLR wood cheeks for sale on etsy.

Andy for his vector file tips and clean-up, and vinyl printing and cutting for the prototype faceplates.

Craig Anthony Perkins (aka Genshi), a film composer, synth performer, former video game QA lead, and Product Manager at a large music gear company, is beta testing and has made some cool performance videos of The NDLR. Check out his YouTube channel.

Nick Oakley, award winning industrial designer, is contributing design and artwork for The NDLR. And wow, it looks fantastic!

Jesse is helping with customer support on the Conductive Labs forum. He's a synth head who is studying electronics design and making his own eurorack modules.
Special thanks to Paul and Robin at PJRC.COM for their great Teensy development platform and massive code base. And the regulars who help out on the PJRC forum.
Special thanks to Notes and Volts channel on YouTube for giving as the seed to start down this path.
And a big thanks to our KS and Indiegogo backers who made this all possible!",10.0,2,"1 Campaign

<p>We’ve already done a lot of the legwork. The critical next steps are to finish work on the components and printed circuits for the final prototype, and begin testing the consumer version hardware. We’re packing a lot of technology into HUB’s compact form factor, and getting everything ready for primetime on schedule will require the combined efforts of our entire team. Now we’re turning to crowdfunding to raise the funds needed to finish our consumer-ready prototype and bring HUB to the world.

</p>
<p><b>Why Crowdfunding</b></p>
<p>When we first started developing HUB, we quickly realized that we had something that people were going to love. The crowdfunding community has been responsible for supporting some amazing projects by creators like us, and we felt that they would be equally as excited about HUB.

<p>

The idea for HUB first came about when, over a few cups of coffee, we lamented the quality and selection of wireless audio devices, and resolved to do better. We brainstormed about a user-friendly wireless listening system that could meet the needs of the most discerning high-tech audiophile, while keeping things simple enough for anyone to enjoy. After a few hundred more cups of coffee, HUB began to take shape, and we enlisted the expertise of several other colleagues including product designers, developers and engineers to help us make HUB a reality.</p>

</div>","Introducing HUB by ekko, the first Hi-Fi, Wi-Fi audio hub for headphones and speakers. It lets you instantly share wireless audio with multiple simultaneous listeners using any earbuds, headphones or powered speakers. This is the wireless sound experience you’ve been waiting for.
** HUB prices will increase as we move closer to the product delivery date. Pre-order today to lock in your below retail price! **







HUB, by ekko Audio
















HUB allows you to use any headphones or speakers to enjoy high resolution wireless audio. It's the world's hi-fi listening hub designed specifically for multiple users
Use virtually any headphones or speakers with sound-pucks.

Share real-time wireless audio with 4+ users

A revolutionary approach to group listening, HUB uses ultra-low latency Wi-Fi technology to stream real-time audio to multiple listeners. Its audiophile-grade quality is enough to satisfy the needs of the most demanding listeners, while its design is simple enough for the whole family to enjoy. It’s a perfect solution for music, movies, games, and more.  



Built-in Wi-Fi casts hi-res audio from any source to multiple listeners.





Connect the base station to any audio source, and built-in Wi-Fi instantly streams audio to one or more portable wireless receivers.



Connect virtually any input for instant wireless audio.














Individual wireless receivers


In addition to the app, each receiver incorporates volume and mute functions for simple control over each user’s listening experience.



Individual user controls include volume, mute, and equalizer settings.





HUB is built to the highest standard using the best materials and carefully monitored production facilities to ensure quality control.


App-controlled LED light color selections

Mock-up of app controlled, RGB LED lights on base station and sound-pucks























HUB's high-resolution 96kHz / 24-bit audio quality and individual user equalizer settings allows each listener to personalize their own listening experience. Listen loud? Prefer softer sound? Adjust your settings to suit your preference without interrupting anyone else’s.

 




Adjust volume and EQ settings to suit your listening preference.








Compatible with everything
Easily play audio from any hardwired source via HUB’s RCA / AUX and optical audio inputs, and wirelessly via Airplay/DLNA. Additionally, ekko allows users to stream from mobile devices using their favorite streaming media apps, or directly from their Windows or Mac devices.






Wireless charging

Connect the base station to any audio source, and built-in Wi-Fi instantly streams audio to one or more portable wireless receivers.



HUB is built with magnetic docking bays to insure sound-pucks stay in place while they are charged inductively.






Connect any pair of earbuds, headphones or speakers to one of ekko’s rechargeable wireless sound-pucks. Support for 4+ simultaneous users.




The only wireless audio system designed for multiple users.








Control everything from one app
Mobile app lets you customize your listening experience. Fine-tune equalizer settings, set volume safety limits, manage security features like encryption and password protection, access your favorite streaming music services, and more.




Adjustable safe volume limits


Volume safety limits help parents to ensure safe listening for kids. Adjust maximum volume levels, or manage each receiver’s volume in real-time using the mobile app.




Volume limiting allows safer listening for kids. (..and keeps parents sane!)








Simple multi-room audio
In addition to headphones, HUB can connect to any powered speakers or stereo system, allowing you to set up a wireless multi-zone audio system in seconds. Control each zone’s volume and equalizer settings using the mobile app.



Connect wirelessly to any speakers for instant multi-room audio. Individual sound-pucks have USB charging for semi-permanent mounting.


Rechargeable sound-pucks are a perfect solution for temporary setups like parties, while an optional individual charging accessory will be available for semi-permanent installations. HUB is an DIY multi-room audio solution that does not require professional setup.



HUB is a great option for parties! Stream music inside and outside your home with no loss in quality or delay.

HUB vs. other wireless audio systems



Stretch goals





Beautifully functional design

HUB was thoughtfully designed to look great in any setting. Currently available in two color choices: black or silver.



Elegant design is simple enough for the whole family to enjoy. Just take a sound-puck, plug in headphones and enjoy!

















 




3.5mm / TRS and optical inputs accept sound from any source.












hub mini: 2-user model
HUB will come in three versions: the standard 4-user model, the 2-user HUB mini, and the HUB solo for single users.

<h2 align=""center""><strong>IDEA</strong></h2>
<p align=""center"">Our mission is to create music gear that improves and changes the way people approach and play music. The crazy idea of making the PLUS Pedal is what brought us together almost 4 years ago. After a lot of hard work, we've managed to bring PLUS Pedal, and then PLASMA Pedal to musicians all over the world, and now it is time to make MOTOR Synth an even greater success!</p>
<p align=""center"">This is the reason we turn to crowdfunding. We wish to make MOTOR Synth available to everyone in terms of soonest delivery and best price point. This means that we need to organize our production in larger batches. Being a small company, this means that <strong>we need your help</strong> to make big things happen. Together we can make MOTOR Synth a reality in the quickest and most accessible way.</p>

The instrument’s eight-electromotor configuration makes it a four-note true polyphonic synth with two voices per key played.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Firstly, <strong>magnetic pickups</strong> are placed on each of its eight electromotors; the spinning coils result in a very industrial-sounding, over-the-top analogue tone. Think eight harmonious revving engines pumping out an intimidating noise!</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Secondly, specially designed <strong>reflective optical disks</strong> have been attached to the shafts of each electromotor. Each disk contains a graphical representation of three standard audio wave-shapes. As the electromotors spin, the disks are set into circular motion, and each wave-shape is read by a dedicated set of infrared sensors, then converted into an audio signal. Thus, the wave-shapes on the reflective optical disks become precise musical notes, corresponding to the speed of the electromotors.</p>

</div></div>","Motor Synth is an analogue, electro-mechanical synthesizer that uses a system of electromotors as its main sound source.
Motor Synth represents a new method of analogue audio signal generation since digitally controlled electromotors have never been used as the principal sound source for a commercial musical instrument — indeed, nothing like it has ever been built before!
 
Unique industrial motor sounds for music creation and soundscapingOut-of-this-world, yet warm analogue harmonics and overtonesA completely new way of sound Generation in a commercial instrumentA powerful synthesizer with familiar controls designed for playability


IDEA
Our mission is to create music gear that improves and changes the way people approach and play music. The crazy idea of making the PLUS Pedal is what brought us together almost 4 years ago. After a lot of hard work, we've managed to bring PLUS Pedal, and then PLASMA Pedal to musicians all over the world, and now it is time to make MOTOR Synth an even greater success!
This is the reason we turn to crowdfunding. We wish to make MOTOR Synth available to everyone in terms of soonest delivery and best price point. This means that we need to organize our production in larger batches. Being a small company, this means that we need your help to make big things happen. Together we can make MOTOR Synth a reality in the quickest and most accessible way.

</div></div>","Meet Changer: Bluetooth 5, premium earphones that charge your devices, share power, & transfer data.
 
Welcome to a new era of audio technology (& never buy another set of earphones – or charging cables – again).
 
Gone are the days of MP3 players and iPods. Most of our music now lives on our smart phones. Audio apps, however, drain battery quickly, both of the phone itself but also of wireless earphones.
That’s why we developed Changer – Bluetooth earphones that not only offer premium sound quality, but also end the need to carry multiple charging cables with you everywhere you go.
Changer doesn't just provide an incredible listening experience, it solves the #1 issue many people face every day – low battery! 
This is the next step in the evolution of traditional Bluetooth earphones. Thanks for taking time to see how Changer can transform your technology.


Up until now, the only way to charge Bluetooth earphones is with a charging cable. That means leaving the house with yet ANOTHER cable in your bag if you want to stay charged. You can charge your Changer bluetooth earphones directly from a powerbank. Easy and accessible, no additional cable necessary!Not only does Changer support 2A fast charging, it also has a hidden adapter design that supports lighting, micro-USB and TypeC, too. You'll never need to buy another charging cable again.When you're out and about and your phone is low on battery, but there's no power supply in sight? No problem! With Changer, you can use your friend's phone as a source of power (and even to transfer data). Power, on demand, wherever you are. (Note: Only Android devices can share power with this version of Charger)In addition to the lengthy 12 hours playing time,  Changer is the world's first neck-mounted Bluetooth earphones that has a replaceable battery.The spare battery can be charged independently, so you can listen to music while charging. No waiting, no limitations.We know, there are a whole host of wireless earphones out there that offer great sound quality and solid technology. However, there are some fundamental problems with what's on the market today.One example: their lithium battery is small. Not only does it have a short life-span, but it's also more unstable (no one likes an explosion in their ear mid-song). Here are a few more differences to help you make your own mind up:

We might offer a host of new features that other earphones don't, but that doesn't mean we cut corners elsewhere. Our 13mm driver, with a 20HZ-40KHz frequency response, has been awarded Japanese Hi-res certification.



We only use the best solution: RTL8763Bx chipset. 
The fastest CPU, stable reception, and best power saving ability. Changer provides all you need.



Whether you’re exercising, commuting, or just in the mood for a dance in the rain, don't let water hold you back from jamming to your favorite tunes. 










All Charger backers will receive a one-year global warranty. No questions asked.
Also, due to our patented modular design, Changer is upgradeable. After this campaign has delivered, we'll begin to plan an upgraded version and your feedback will be critical.
We believe that a true innovation comes from the ever-evolving technology. We can't wait for you to be a part of this journey.",40.0,1,"1 Campaign

We've re-written the rule book to create a sound that makes you smile...""- Adam Blair, Founder, PUMP AudioHi Indiegogo, we’re PUMP Audio.We’ve come back to Indiegogo to announce the Launch of our brand new generation of Wired In-Ear headphones.PUMP's ground-breaking “V1” and “V2” models have previously taken the headphone market by storm, receiving hundreds of official 5 star reviews, and thousands of unofficial ones from users in more than 60 countries around the World.MIX and BOOM take the core sound of PUMP ""V1"" and ""V2"" to the next level of desirability and functionality with these brand new user driven upgrades:>> *New* longer 1.4 Meter cable -- as requested by many of our music producer users -- for MIX. The same 1.2 Meter cable for BOOM;>> *New* “L” Shape jack plug;>> *New* lapel clip;>> *New* in-line Mic and Media/Volume Control;>> *New* Microphone moved closer to your mouth for crystal clear conversations;>> *New* “L” and “R” Symbols now Orange for easy visibility.Unlike many new headphone innovations that appear on crowdfunding sites, which often focus on a gimmick or new technological idea, PUMP Audio headphones are all about one thing:At PUMP Audio, we truly believe that sound is by far the most important element in any set of headphones.So much so that it's our official company slogan.After sound comes comfort, usability and style in that order, with manufacturing quality a given.The sub-bass reproduction and unique sound signature of MIX and BOOM are something that we’ve developed from the ground up over the course of nearly three years, and it’s something we’re very proud of.The obvious difference between PUMP Audio headphones and other brands is the quality and depth of the bass and sub-bass reproduction.The other big difference between PUMP Audio and those other brands is what we've done with the rest of the frequency range.We haven't simply sacrificed the rest of the range so that all you hear is over-powering bass.Instead we've painstakingly created a totally unique sound signature that gives you immense bass, but with balance, clarity, and high fidelity Audiophile quality sound through the entire range.PUMP Audio vs Beats: 74% preferred PUMP / 26% preferred Beats. Models tested: PUMP IEM V1 vs Beats TourPUMP Audio vs BOSE: 89% preferred PUMP / 11% preferred BOSE. Models tested: PUMP Zeus vs BOSE QC15 and BOSE QC25PUMP Audio vs Sennheiser: 85% preferred PUMP / 15% preferred Sennheiser. Models tested: PUMP Pure vs Sennheiser Momentum On-EarPUMP Audio vs SoundMAGIC: 95% preferred PUMP / 5% preferred SoundMAGIC. Models tested: PUMP IEM V2 vs SoundMAGIC E50SPUMP Audio vs SMS Audio: 96% preferred PUMP / 4% preferred SMS Audio. Models tested: PUMP Zeus vs SMS Audio Street by 50 over earFull results and methodology at: http://pump-audio.com/blindfold-test-results/In fact we’re so confident in the immense sound they produce that we’ve decided -- just as with our last Indiegogo campaign --  to offer a 90 day trial to all Indiegogo Backers who order MIX and/or BOOM during the launch campaign.From the very beginning, we started by creating Amazing Bass™.With many top-end headphones, you need to turn the volume up very high to really get the bass you want, because they are very mid range heavy.And when you do that, the highs become too harsh (for Electronic music in particular).We tuned PUMP specifically for lovers of Electronic and Dance music, although they sound pretty incredible with ALL genres according to our Artist and User reviews.Many more Artist reviews can be seen at: http://pump-audio.com/artist-endorsements/ Earl Powell received Grammy, Billboard and Gold recognition as a Writer, Producer, and Engineer on Jennifer Hudson's “Stand Up,” from her self-titled debut recording project. He’s currently working with The Jacksons as a group as well as the solo projects of Tito Jackson, Jermaine Jackson, and Jermaine's son Jafaar Jackson.- New Lapel Clip -Although a simple addition, we’ve heard requests for a lapel clip so often from our Friends that we finally realised it’s what PUMP users want. The new PUMP lapel clip means that you can exercise with the cable held securely in place.- New “L” Shape Jack -This has been requested by many users who feel that an L jack fits more neatly when they're carrying their phone of music player in their pocket.- New Cable Lengths -At the request of quite a number of industry people — particularly music producers — we’ve extended the length of MIX to 1.4M. BOOM remains at 1.2M, which should be plenty for the vast majority of non professional users.- *BRAND NEW* In Line Media/Volume Control! -An in line media/volume control has been the single biggest request we’ve had from our Friends since the launch of PUMP Version 1. And now we’ve done it.Weighing in at less than 1g, it doesn’t distort the sound quality in any way.- Left and Right Symbols now in Orange -This was another big request from users who pointed out that the old “L” and “R” symbols were too difficult (or impossible) to see in low light.Each set has been specifically designed to work with the internal architecture of MIX and BOOM to ensure they sound the same, no matter what size ear canal you have.It's not just a case of choosing any old eartips, as this can ruin the sound quality!It's really important to choose the right eartips for your ears, otherwise your PUMPs won't sound quite right and you may start to wonder what all the fuss is about…Using the best size for your ear makes a BIG difference!If you're someone who likes to use custom moulded eartips, both MIX and BOOM are supported models for Snugs custom moulded Eartips.You can get MIX in our signature PUMP Orange, or BOOM in the brand new slightly more understated Burnt Orange:Both MIX and BOOM also come in the same Jet Black:Both colour options come with machined aluminium casing.If you damage or break your PUMPs, fear not... We definitely don’t want to leave you in the lurch just because you had an accident or lent them to someone who’s a bit too heavy handed.That’s why we offer PUMPreplace.Just get in touch with a copy of your receipt and a picture of your damaged PUMPs and we’ll arrange another set for you (minus the packaging, accessories, manuals etc. that you already have) at a heavily subsidised price.This price may change a little from time to time, but it will always be a fraction of the “new” price, so just ask us what it is currently.Your 5 Year PUMPreplace Guarantee does not effect your standard PUMP 2 Year full product warranty.* you must register for PUMPreplace at pump-audio.com to be eligible (it’s free!).We appreciate that there are some pretty major claims made about the sound quality of MIX and BOOM in this Launch campaign.If you are already a Friend of PUMP then you will know that these claims are no exaggeration.However, if you're new to the PUMP Family we understand that there may be some scepticism; after all, how different can one set of headphones sound from another?Well the answer is a LOT (as you will see from the Artist Reviews and User Reviews), and to prove that to you, we're offering all Indiegogo Launch Backers a 100% no quibble 90 Day Trial on both MIX and BOOM.It means that you can back this campaign with absolutely no risk.If you don’t think your BOOM and/or MIX are as amazing as we do, just send them back for a complete refund, no questions asked and no hard feelings.But fair warning... once you hear them, the last thing you are going to want to do is send them back to us.We’re looking forward to welcoming you as a Friend of PUMP, and thank you in advance for your support from everyone here at PUMP HQ!The Small PrintImport Duties may be payable in countries outside the UK and USA.  Indiegogo Launch DiscountsPUMP BOOM: MSRP be £29 after Launch (£10 Launch Discount!)PUMP MIX: MSRP be £59 after Launch (£20 Launch Discount!)Risks & ChallengesAs with all Indiegogo projects there are risks, and these are the steps we take to mitigate against them:1- Loss of or damage to the shipment en route to us:We air shipments from the factory to us and all shipments are fully insured.

<h3>Versus Me 2nd Album!</h3>
<p>Hello guys! We are currently working on our sophomore effort and we need <strong>YOUR</strong> help. We have teamed up with Indiegogo to help raise funds for our next album.  We are an independent band and everything we do, we fund ourselves. We want to be able to give you the music that you love and deserve! Everything that we are able to do is because of you guys so please help us take this to the next level!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Every little bit helps! Get some EXCLUSIVE perks!</h3>
<h3>What we need &amp; what you get!   </h3>
<p>Although we do everything ourselves, there are some things that we do require help with. Your funds will help go towards the production and tracking of this album as well as the mixing and mastering.  We will also be marketing this album ourselves! We will be using the funds to shoot a music video for the first single off of the record as well as to promote to every news publication we can!</p>
<p>The funds will be allocated as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Professional Tracking, Production, Mixing and Mastering - $6000</li>
<li>Music Video Shoot, Locations, Lights and Editing - $2000</li>
<li>Album Marketing Budget (PR, Social Media, Publications) - $2000</li>

<h3>The Impact</h3>

<li>Writing/Tracking a record is challenging enough on its own without the impending financial weight of such a large undertaking!

                            and more....Financial, Technology, Lifestyle:             and more....



At Braaper, we have a passion for two things: music and moto. So we set out on a mission to create a speaker system that captures the motorsport lifestyle, while bringing the state-of-the-art audio technology that 21st-century music fanatics demand of their speaker systems at the same time. The result: Braaper, the Pipe That Plays Music and More! 

Together at Last
Music and moto go together like harmony and melody. With Braaper, it’s never easier to crank the tunes that are the perfect soundtrack to the perfect ride. Do you braap iTunes? Or maybe Deezer, Spotify or iRadio is more your speed. Whatever your streaming service of choice, Braaper brings the music to life in big, beautiful, high fidelity sound.


Hit the RoadThe motorsport lifestyle is all about being on the go, so we wanted our speakers to be built for maximum mobility. Whether you’re at home, in the office, or off to the beach, Braaper goes wherever you go. Built to Last the Road and Off RoadBraaper is built for maximum durability, too. Mud, dust, water… bring it on! After all, if our speakers pipe concept can survive the intense ride of motocross, they can survive anything!As in the racing world Braaper speakers come in 2 feature-packed versions. The Stock version and the Factory edition: The Stock EditionStock Edition Braaper speakers are made from high quality ABS plastic casing with attention to detail and motorsport-level finishing. Their unique design yields the maximum music performance and with standard GoPro supports compatibility for maximum portability. The finishing is completed by a real fine metal front wrap band, fixed with aluminum rivets! Ruggedized and water resistant to be used in different conditions. 
Stock Edition Matte Black (soft touch)
The Factory Racing Edition Racing Grade Carbon Fiber-AluminumThe Factory Racing Edition is the flagship of the Braaper line. Improving the Braaper Stock edition performances was no easy task. We teamed up with MotocrossLAB.com R&D and Sound Engineers to create a factory-edition Braaper with racing-grade mechanical features and state of the art sound performances. Braaper Factory speakers are made entirely of CNC aluminum and real carbon fiber material, completed by a real fine metal front wrap band, fixed with aluminum rivets! Products in this line feature racing grade material and finishing, providing better shock and dirt resistance. Ruggedized and water resistant  to be used in different conditions. Audio performance mods we made from Stock Edition:

Adoption of a High performance acustic driver with neodymium magnet to get the best performance in the small Braaper size. Neodymium is a rare Earth element magnet.

Integration of aptX® codec for high-quality Bluetooth stereo sound
Improved Sound pressure level (SPL-A) from 85-90 dB to 90-95dB @ 0,5m/2ft (1 or 2 paired speakers)
And coming soon from Braaper: the Braaper Juke Box app, designed specifically to work with Braaper speakers! When we say mobile, we mean mobile: wherever you go, you can take Braaper with you: At home At the office (this is our first prototype) With your TVIn your CarOn your BikeOn your MotorcycleAt the racetrack On the beach  And more... We created Braaper to celebrate the moto lifestyle, and that mission was at the front of our minds throughout the Braaper design process. Braaper is designed by a leading Italian art designer to capture the look of a competition motorbike exhaust system. And the resemblance goes way beyond the visual. When you start up your Braaper, you'll hear the sound of an engine revving up. Crank the volume to max, and you’ll be met with another roar. And when you power Braaper down, you will hear an engine rumbling to a stop.Engine Sound Effects  After all, that's where Braaper gets its name: from that unmistakable motorcycle engine sound that means freedom, fun and an unforgettable ride. We made it our mission to pack innovative technology into Braaper at every turn. Here are just a few of the incredible features that make Braaper unlike any other speaker out there:Play What You WantMusic, movies, TV, web videos, video games — if it’s got audio, Braaper's got it covered. On the GoBraaper works with GoPro action camera mounts, so you can mount Braaper in your car, on your bike, on a stroller — anywhere!No Strings AttachedBraaper connects wirelessly with your iPhone, iPad, tablets, smartphones and more! Your Gadget, Your Music Braaper is compatible with iOS, Mac OSX, Android, Windows, Blackberry and moreThat Sweet Stereo SoundSync two Braaper speakers together and just like that you’ll get true, dimensional stereo sound!Look, No Hands!  The Braaper speakerphone makes hands-free calling a breeze. Plus with built-in noise cancelling microphones, your call never sounded better! Recharge Your RideBraaper is powered by a rechargeable lithium battery for 8-10 hours of rich and vibrant sound, with standard micro-USB port for easy recharging.We have some amazing rewards lined up to thank you for being a part of the Braaper success story. We’re planning to have everything ready to ship before Christmas.Stock Edition Braaper BreakdownsSINGLE PACKAGESDUAL PACKAGESFactory Edition Braaper BreakdownsSINGLE PACKAGESDUAL PACKAGESDealer PackagesAccessories and GadgetsFREE COVER REWARDS We have prototypes of our Braaper speakers already complete, and distributors waiting in the wings to carry our products. But we have just a little more work to do before Braaper’s ready for the market, and that’s where your help comes in!We didn't take Braaper to Indiegogo just to raise funds. Just like other successful entrepreneurs here in Indiegogo, we value the power of feedback from early adopters. Your feedback will help us to best determine the direction that the speaker takes in the future. We will poll your ideas to shape the final version.With this fundraiser, our goal is to raise $15,000 to help us put the finishing touches on tooling and manufacturing, complete some patent and certification requirements.If we can stretch to $30,000 we'll be able to develop the Braaper Juke Box app. If we reach 50.000 we can expand our line with new styles! This will be the addition of a shiny chrome or Black-Aluminum detailed speakers to our existing black matte version. We have completed the industrial design - and spent months testing (and more importantly using) prototypes and refining the Braaper from great to delightful. We also patented the Braaper design all over the world!We are ready to complete the final production design and guide the Braaper through Bluetooth, CE, RoHS, FCC and REACH certifications, before tooling up at the factory and getting your pack of Braapers shipped as soon as possible.This is the timeline:Additionally, we will also contribute to the Riders for Riders Association, a non profit organization dedicated to helping injured riders, as we will devote a percentage  of our revenues to help riders who have permanent riding related injuries as well families who have lost a child during a race.

<p>In order to improve on the signal reliability for wireless equipment, we found the perfect shape of earbuds, best materials, and optimized positions for the vital components. Our engineers tested the antenna of the gogo-s in a professional “Dark Room,”putting over a million dollars into research and development—an amount of research usually only completed by mega corporations like Nokia and Sony.  We also analyzed the coefficients through testing on lifelike models by Vector Network Analyzer, getting the most accurate adjustments possible.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We have already implemented Duet Play Technology on the gogo sports music player, which is in pre-sale, and will be released in July 2015. The performance of Duet Play Technology will be enhanced and improved on the gogo-s.</p>

<p>Combining both a 9 axis and an optical sensor, we’ve managed to reduce any shaking that would affect your activity data. The inner earbuds of the gogo-s would sit deeper inside of the ear, which would vastly improve the accuracy of dynamic heart-rate detection. </p>

<p><span>G-­Wearables was founded by well known semiconductor and LED expert Cheng Guo in 2013. As a sports and technology enthusiast, he found existing sports equipment to be more annoying than beneficial. Therefore, he came up with the idea of developing a pair of all-­in-one truly wireless sports earbuds, to combine together the functions which people care about most, and provide a comfortable wearing experience.</span></p>

<h3>Timeline</h3>
<div>Since we changed Bluetooth to NFMI solution for the connection between each earbuds, we have to use new suppliers. We hope that the solution changing won't influent the schedule too much, however, according to our source that the earlist day we'll get the official NFMI chip from mass production would be next March. We are very sorry to tell you that we have to delay the delivery of gogo-s, but no matter how, we will not stop our work on it, the development and trail of the earbuds with the development board are still on the track.<br/>

<p><b>New Timeline of manufacturing of gogo-s (NFMI Plan)</b></p>
<p>December 2015: Requirement Fixed with new NFMI Plan </p>
<p>January 2016: ID Fixed</p>
<p>February 2016: Hardware prototype with function complete    </p>
<p>March 2016: Pilot production  </p>
<p>Mid of April 2016: Mass production</p>

With Gogo-S, you’ll be able to move, free of wires and cords, while gaining a better understanding of your performance and abilities, through the latest and most intuitive technology






Why gogo-s is so unique?


gogo-s is an in-ear music player, a dynamic heart rate sensor, an activity tracker with audio training guide and lightweight, 100% waterproof, totally wireless. 
Your new smart workout companion.







gogo-s in different scenarios








 












Revolutionary Technology





By using Duet Play Technology, the gogo-s enables concurrent communication between two earbuds, without the connection of unwieldy wires. The gogo-s earbuds can also communicate with smart phones, so you can stream your favorite workout jams, completely wirelessly.

In order to improve on the signal reliability for wireless equipment, we found the perfect shape of earbuds, best materials, and optimized positions for the vital components. Our engineers tested the antenna of the gogo-s in a professional “Dark Room,”putting over a million dollars into research and development—an amount of research usually only completed by mega corporations like Nokia and Sony.  We also analyzed the coefficients through testing on lifelike models by Vector Network Analyzer, getting the most accurate adjustments possible.

We have already implemented Duet Play Technology on the gogo sports music player, which is in pre-sale, and will be released in July 2015. The performance of Duet Play Technology will be enhanced and improved on the gogo-s.





Combining both a 9 axis and an optical sensor, we’ve managed to reduce any shaking that would affect your activity data. The inner earbuds of the gogo-s would sit deeper inside of the ear, which would vastly improve the accuracy of dynamic heart-rate detection. 
After endless treadmill tests, we found gogo­-s to be more accurate than the Apple Watch in tracking heart rates during peak activity.





The gogo-s doesn’t just track your speed, steps, and heart rate. It turns that data into actionable advice towards reaching your fitness goals. Our audio training guide will give you real-time feedback and suggestions based on your pace and heart rate during your workout, helping you avoid injury and exercise more effectively.


The training plans were created by sports experts and fitness trainers. To achieve a training goal, people need to follow a day-by-day plan, and complete daily training tasks. These plans can be tailored to the user’s specific requirements and goals, therefore and aim to significantly improve the specific user’s training effectiveness. 





The gogo-s brings you the highest quality of audio technology, free from pesky cords. Our Duet Play Technology allows both earbuds to seamlessly sync with your smartphone, so you can stream your favorite workout jams wirelessly.





If you don’t want to carry your smartphone, the gogo-s comes complete with 4GB of local storage space. You can store up to 1000 songs and create your most invigorating playlists on our “Go Sport” App.






The gogo-s is 100% waterproof and sweat-proof. Our speakers can be fully submerged in up to 1 meter of water. Whether you’re running through the rain or swimming laps in a pool, your gogo-s won’t miss a beat.




We use the ip67 standard waterproof-mesh on the speakers of gogo-s. 


The control button and its surrounding material is formed with Double-Colored Injection technology. 


The connection of two Parting Surfaces utilizes Ultrasonic Welding Technology.

The circuits are placed on PCB board and together coated by Nano waterproof material.







To keep its simple and smooth product design, we only designed one button on each earbud of Gogo-s. However, all of the operations can be done by this single button—just follow the special operating instructions. This allows for easy access, even mid-workout.

Designed for Speed and Staying in Place


When you’re moving quickly, you want your earbuds to stay put. The gogo-s is equipped with drop-proof inner earbuds that fit securely in your ear, keeping the sensor in place no matter what you’re doing. The gogo-­s is available in three sizes, for maximum comfort and security.


Sound Meant to Last

In order to give users a better experience, the battery life for gogo-s earbuds is around 3 to 5 hours, which ensures the accurate operation during your entire workout and exercise regimen. 
The gogo-s is meant to outlast even your toughest workout. Each gogo-s comes with a portable charging case, fully charging both earbuds in just 40 minutes.






What's in the box?




Our Team

G-­Wearables was founded by well known semiconductor and LED expert Cheng Guo in 2013. As a sports and technology enthusiast, he found existing sports equipment to be more annoying than beneficial. Therefore, he came up with the idea of developing a pair of all-­in-one truly wireless sports earbuds, to combine together the functions which people care about most, and provide a comfortable wearing experience.


G-Wearables consists of a team of technology experts, product designers, and experienced engineers. In addition to their commitment to technical excellence,    G-Wearables believes that wearable devices should be stylish and on trend.
In 2014, G-Wearables released their first product, the Goccia Activity Tracker, and was honored with the prestigious Silver IDEA Design Award. In May 2015, G-Wearables attended CES Asia, and was honored to be a finalist of Best Wearable of CES 2015.





Timeline
Since we changed Bluetooth to NFMI solution for the connection between each earbuds, we have to use new suppliers. We hope that the solution changing won't influent the schedule too much, however, according to our source that the earlist day we'll get the official NFMI chip from mass production would be next March. We are very sorry to tell you that we have to delay the delivery of gogo-s, but no matter how, we will not stop our work on it, the development and trail of the earbuds with the development board are still on the track.


New Timeline of manufacturing of gogo-s (NFMI Plan)
December 2015: Requirement Fixed with new NFMI Plan 
January 2016: ID Fixed
February 2016: Hardware prototype with function complete    
March 2016: Pilot production  
Mid of April 2016: Mass production
End of April 2016: Ship the perk  

Risks & Challenges
 

Any innovation will face many risks and challenges, and Gogo-s is no exception. To ensure the small and compact design of Gogo-s, we have to choose very small components for it and some of the components are difficult to acquire. The risk of delays in the supply of these components may cause delays in manufacturing and shipping.We’ve applied a lot of new technology in the gogo-s. There are no similar products that can be referenced to or compared to. Therefore, inconsistencies of performance may occur in actual use and in the testing environment. 
However, we have already made the gogo sports music player, which shares key technologies with the gogo-s, and will be released soon for testing in the real market. The gogo music player is going to be released in July 2015. The performance of key features, such as Duet Play Technology, will be enhanced and improved on the gogo-s.


Although there are many obstacles to hurdle in the process of developing  gogo-s, we are well-prepared, and will try our best to reduce the risk to a minimum. With your support, we think we will be able to present the gogo-s to you as soon as possible.

It behaves like a friendly personal coach communicating to you under water. Talking to you with instant voice feedback based on artificial intelligence and bone conduction technologies. Information on swimming time and distance can be communicated to you in real time so you can improve your swimming skills quickly.Galerdo Beker Pro was created by Jordan Huang and his team at Galerdo Inc., a professional audio company that specializes in developing the headset-free trackers for swimmers and runners based on artificial intelligence and bone conduction technology.The Galerdo Beker Pro won the prestigious CES 2020 Innovation award for its innovation incorporating AI technology and bone-induction together. As a laps swimmer, you enjoy swimming for strength, competition, and ultimately health.Swimming, however can often easily become routine and boring because of the monotony, not to mention the silence.   That's why we created the Galerdo™ Beker Pro. We love swimming ourselves and want more participants to enjoy the wonders of this exercise style.Galerdo™ is our second product based on our bone conduction technology. Since our first product, the Beker Waterproof MP3 Player was successfully launched in 2016, many of our users kept asking us to bring headset-free design and Bone Conduction technology together not only for the swimming music player, but also for the swimming tracker.Our customers were looking for a cutting edge alternative device that could be placed on the head to replace the traditional watches, trackers, and wristbands that are readily available in the market.After 3 Years of intensive research & development, a revolutionary milestone is here: AI-enabled audio swimming tracker Galerdo™. Join us and swim differently! Galerdo™ is designed as the world's first headset-free and true wireless swimming audio tracker with Instant AI Voice Assistant.  Galerdo -- AI Audio Swimming Tracker Unlike other devices with only silent tracking or only music playing, Galerdo™ creatively combines AI-enabled swim tracker and waterproof MP3 player together, playing voice feedback and musical sound in turns or at the same time, and has headset-free and true wireless features.●Built-in real-time tracker for swimming workouts.●Built-in real-time voice assistant based on Artificial Intelligence and Bone Conduction           technology.●Built-in waterproof MP3 music player.With the real-time motivation of voice feedback and music in the pool, you’ll be swimming more freely and motivated and, ultimately, train longer. We’re looking forward to providing a bonus to every Galerdo™ supporter if we can reach our stretch goal of $50,000. This bonus will give you the option to choose from three colors: yellow, pink and grey. After we reach our goal we will contact you to select your preferred color option before shipment.Another exciting bonus will be available if we can reach our stretch goal of $150,000. Currently the built-in voices speak only English and Chinese. When we reach this next goal, the audio will be available in an extra 4 languages. All of these extra language choices can be easily installed via Bluetooth function. More than just a tracker, Galerdo™ works perfectly as a friendly and personal audio coach on your head under water. This increases motivation for your training and ultimately your swimming skills & endurance! Train with Real-Time Progress UpdatesGalerdo™ comes with real-time AI Voice Assistant based on Artificial Intelligence and Bone Conduction technology.The device tracks your swim progress and analyzes it based on our AI technology It also provides voice feedback on distance and time you swam in real time. Tracking swimming activities has never been so easy. Forget counting sheep or other distractions that are hampering your work out! Built-in Artificial Intelligence  Built-in AI Voice Assistant for swimming No need to connect to Internet, WAN or Bluetooth while swimming！With the built-in swim-specific intelligent algorithm we've created, your real-time lap performance is seamlessly recorded, tracked and analyzed in the Galerdo™ device without delay. Hear Your Favorite Songs   More than just a tracker, Galerdo™ can also play your favorite songs under water.With this tracking, speaking and music-playing device, you’ll stay motivated and self-confident to swim longer, faster and better. You'll never feel bored or lonely in the pool again. Galerdo™  Beker Pro was designed to have a natural shape like a cowry shell. It is also ultra lightweight enough that you can not only work out with it easily, but will also probably forget you are wearing it! The device will not influence your stroke or speed in water.
The device itself does not contain any straps, cords, wires, headsets, earphones or earbuds to bother your head and ears while swimming. Just put Galerdo™ under your swimming cap and swim. Enoy the tracker in the most comfortable, friendly and easy-to-use way！
The photos below show swimmers putting Galerdo™ under their swim caps instead of clipping it with a goggle strap.  
  Everyone’s ears are different, right? When you buy wired earbud-based trackers, you may worry whether your earbuds or earphones fit your ears. That's why sometimes you have to buy other earbuds to fit your ears but still feel ear pain or discomfort.    Now, thanks to the cutting-edge bone conduction technology with earbuds-free and earphone-free features, Galerdo™ provides you with a super comfort guarantee for ears and inserts nothing into the ear canal.●Keeps your ear canal free●Fits all ear sizes●No need for extra accessories  Unlike swimming wristbands that detect your swimming strokes based on the wrist movement, Galerdo™ recognizes your swimming stroke based on the movement of the head, which guarantees a more accurate recognition of swimming strokes.   No matter if you are swimming Freestyle, Breaststroke, Butterfly or Backstroke, Galerdo™ can perfectly record your data. You can review the history of your swimming data stroke by stroke! We have created the built-in AI algorithms instead of the clunky GPS hardware to measure the distance, because we aim to provide a lightweight autonomous device rather than a heavy and complex one on the head.Thus Galerdo™ tracking function works perfectly in regular-shaped swimming pools (rectangle or square) and pool length of 17m~50m, but does not work in irregular swimming pools (such as round, heart-shaped, curved, triangle, polygonal, kidney-shaped, free-form, etc.) and open water swimming (rivers, lakes, ocean). The Galerdo™ music function works perfectly in either pool or open water. The Galerdo™ App is free to download and use. It’s compatible with both iOS and Android phones. You will see your detailed data analysis and customize voice notification settings using our dedicated app.Synchronizing Data to App

Just turn on Bluetooth to seamlessly connect to the Galerdo™ app:

Transfer the data of your swimming workouts from Galerdo™ device to Galerdo™ app.
Get the App update when available.
During your workouts under water, the Voice Assistant notifies you instantly about the distance and time you’ve swum.
After you finish swimming, proceed to synchronization with the App.  You can review a full and comprehensive summary of your swimming workouts by date, month and week.
List of the App data:

●Total swimming distance & time 
●Total kilocalories burned 
●Number of laps 
●Your swimming style 
●Average stroke length 
●Average stroke rate 
●The number of strokes 
●Average speed (SWOLF)
 
Burning Fat Faster   

 
After each swimming, just check your burned calories in the App and motivate yourself to keep swimming.
Automatic Interval Detection

 
It’s awesome for those swimmers who like workouts interrupted by breaks in the pool. The Galerdo™ can automatically detect whether you’re really swimming or just resting in the pool.
You don’t need to turn off Galerdo™ while you are resting, standing or leaning in the pool. The device automatically restarts when you resume swimming.
 
Download Music Files to Device

The built-in Bluetooth V4.2 is designed to synchronize workout data and update the firmware only. You can’t wirelessly download or transmit music files from device to Galerdo™ . All music download to Galerdo™ must be connected with your computer or laptop using a USB cable.

<p>The Muse 5 was modeled after the award winning Apollo 7 platform and embodies similar internal characteristics. A common issue with in-ear audio devices in the market today is the seal around the ear canal, which effects sound quality and bass response.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1473835030/duggjmddoui80ze0o009.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The patented FitSeal™ silicone sleeve creates a truly customized fit for most ear shapes and sizes while optimizing sound quality. Unlike traditional earphones offering only three sizes (S M L), the Muse 5 can be customized into nine different combinations </p>

<p>FitSeal™ offers two key features: Comfortable fit and superior seal. Having a quality seal decreases outside noise and increases bass response. By offering a variety of size combinations with FitSeal™ sleeve technology, we address fit issues seen with other earbuds.<br/><br/>Whether you have a small ear canal and large conch area or a large canal and smaller conch area, we have a solution for you. FitSeal™ sleeves allow the user to use a comfortable tip while securing the ear conch area with the right sleeve creating a quality seal to experience the harmonic music and bass we've designed for you.</p>

<p>One of the most critical factors in true wireless earphones is battery life. We've engineered the Rio 3 to address this common issue in the marketplace. The Rio 3 packs a large lithium battery providing up to 6 hours of audio playback and weighs only 14 grams. Our advanced wireless antenna system is compatible with all Bluetooth 4.0 or higher devices and includes a 14.2 mm Comply Diaphragm Driver for the richest base and harmonic highs.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1473392900/ump3mk5ejj6bw7x6tdqi.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Best of all, the Rio 3 is designed for the active individual. The earbuds are built for comfort and come with a stabilizing ear hook. Whether you are rock climbing, running a marathon or sparring in the ring, the Rio 3 will never hit the ground while in motion.</p>
<p>Huge, 14.2mm ""Extra Bass"" driver - provides clean and dynamic bass slam.</p>
<p>Our proprietary magnesium/titanium sputtered diaphragm is light and stiff - extending the high frequency beyond 20kHz, yet the proprietary alloy provides excellent self-damping to provide crystal clear clarity.</p>
<p>A diaphragm with soft material can provide clean and dynamic bass response in lower frequency but it acts poor in higher frequency. It needs the rigid material to make the diaphragm to provide crystal clear clarity in higher frequency. So our proprietary comply diaphragm used in Rio 3 is a special alloy of Magnesium/Titanium combo sputtered diaphragm, it shows the rigid characteristics and maintain the diaphragm overall softness to provide the best of both characteristics. </p>
<p>The 14.2mm driver used in Rio 3 provides “Extra Bass” compared to the regular 8mm and/or 10mm drivers.</p>

<strong>ERATOSURROUND</strong>™<strong> Explanation</strong>: </h2>
<p>ERATOSURROUND™ can help recreate audio recordings in its most natural state.  For example, when a pianist is performing, we hear sounds differently as the music enters our ears at different times. Even if it takes a few microseconds for the sound to reach either ear, one ear should hear the tune slightly louder than the other as your ears are positioned closer and further away from the piano.  </p>
<p>Recordings can be done in a variety of ways. Some record in stereo with two microphones and others use a binaural recording, where additional microphones are placed to process sound as if was heard live, preserving the audio to create the most realistic experience. While possible with large speakers by splitting it into 5, 7, or even 10 channel surround sound setups, it's difficult in earphones this size. Others have designed headphones with spatial 3D audio by integrating multiple drivers in the headphones but can cost up to hundreds of dollars.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1473393229/jz6be6wgkevtons7ubyt.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>From the beginning it was our intention to create a true wireless audio experience. In bringing this idea to reality we were compelled to address a variety of needs, create multiple designs, and implement a strategy to cultivate a true wireless audio portfolio. </p>
<p>During this process we wanted to create a spectrum of earphones to meet the needs of a variety of customers. By offering an affordable product, an everyday lifestyle product, and a premium luxury product, we will be able to share our technology will millions of people around the world. Since releasing the Apollo 7, we are focusing on the user experience and listening to customer feedback while fine tuning the development of the Rio 3 and Muse 5.</p>

A few months ago, we crowdfunded the Apollo 7 and recently shipped over 20,000 units globally to backers and distributors.  The Apollo 7 received numerous awards including the Honorable Mention Red Dot Award for Design, Mashable's Choice Award, and even earned the Digital Trends' Recommended Product badge of approval.  
From the feedback we gathered, our team listened to what's most important and implemented many new features in our latest products. Erato Audio is excited to announce our next generation of true wireless earphones for the first time here on Indiegogo.
Introducing the Muse 5 and Rio 3

Effortless Wireless
Both the Muse and Rio are designed to be completely wireless.  Enjoy high performance audio without a wire in site - using Advanced Audio Coding (AAC) and aptX™ to bring out quality sound from your digital sources.


The Muse 5 was modeled after the award winning Apollo 7 platform and embodies similar internal characteristics. A common issue with in-ear audio devices in the market today is the seal around the ear canal, which effects sound quality and bass response.

The patented FitSeal™ silicone sleeve creates a truly customized fit for most ear shapes and sizes while optimizing sound quality. Unlike traditional earphones offering only three sizes (S M L), the Muse 5 can be customized into nine different combinations 


FitSeal™ offers two key features: Comfortable fit and superior seal. Having a quality seal decreases outside noise and increases bass response. By offering a variety of size combinations with FitSeal™ sleeve technology, we address fit issues seen with other earbuds.Whether you have a small ear canal and large conch area or a large canal and smaller conch area, we have a solution for you. FitSeal™ sleeves allow the user to use a comfortable tip while securing the ear conch area with the right sleeve creating a quality seal to experience the harmonic music and bass we've designed for you.

With the FitSeal™ sleeves in place, the sleeve only needs to grab on to 2-3 corners of the ear and the silicon will hold the earbud in place without falling out, even in extreme conditions.
Check out the FitSeal™ in action (Shown on three different individuals you can see the tension on the ears being pulled) : 

With FitSeal™, it eliminates the discomfort traditional earphones cause over a long period of use. Instead, the sleeve creates a natural seal on the outer ear (conch area)  while holding the earphones in place at the same time. 



Traditional stereo earphones create surround sound enabling you to hear individual sounds come from every direction (left, right, front, back) Unfortunately, it does not allow you to evaluate the distance of each sound being emitted and whether a specific sound is close or far.

By using digital sound processing technology in our true wireless earphones, we can restore the spatial distance missing in traditional earphones. Calibrated with our micro-driver and its acoustic chamber, ERATOSURROUND™ can reduce sound image distortion to create a more accurate sound stage. 
With our advanced audio technology, we're able to deliver the same experience as heard in expensive over the ear headphones for a fraction of the price. 

The Muse 5 has an audio playback of up to 4 hours, however comes with a carrying case with a battery built in to recharge the Muse 5  up to 3 times on the go. The innovative case can be recharged via micro USB cable, included in each Muse 5 package.  
Available colors below

 



One of the most critical factors in true wireless earphones is battery life. We've engineered the Rio 3 to address this common issue in the marketplace. The Rio 3 packs a large lithium battery providing up to 6 hours of audio playback and weighs only 14 grams. Our advanced wireless antenna system is compatible with all Bluetooth 4.0 or higher devices and includes a 14.2 mm Comply Diaphragm Driver for the richest base and harmonic highs.

Best of all, the Rio 3 is designed for the active individual. The earbuds are built for comfort and come with a stabilizing ear hook. Whether you are rock climbing, running a marathon or sparring in the ring, the Rio 3 will never hit the ground while in motion.
Huge, 14.2mm ""Extra Bass"" driver - provides clean and dynamic bass slam.
Our proprietary magnesium/titanium sputtered diaphragm is light and stiff - extending the high frequency beyond 20kHz, yet the proprietary alloy provides excellent self-damping to provide crystal clear clarity.
A diaphragm with soft material can provide clean and dynamic bass response in lower frequency but it acts poor in higher frequency. It needs the rigid material to make the diaphragm to provide crystal clear clarity in higher frequency. So our proprietary comply diaphragm used in Rio 3 is a special alloy of Magnesium/Titanium combo sputtered diaphragm, it shows the rigid characteristics and maintain the diaphragm overall softness to provide the best of both characteristics. 
The 14.2mm driver used in Rio 3 provides “Extra Bass” compared to the regular 8mm and/or 10mm drivers.






ERATOSURROUND™ Explanation: 
ERATOSURROUND™ can help recreate audio recordings in its most natural state.  For example, when a pianist is performing, we hear sounds differently as the music enters our ears at different times. Even if it takes a few microseconds for the sound to reach either ear, one ear should hear the tune slightly louder than the other as your ears are positioned closer and further away from the piano.  
Recordings can be done in a variety of ways. Some record in stereo with two microphones and others use a binaural recording, where additional microphones are placed to process sound as if was heard live, preserving the audio to create the most realistic experience. While possible with large speakers by splitting it into 5, 7, or even 10 channel surround sound setups, it's difficult in earphones this size. Others have designed headphones with spatial 3D audio by integrating multiple drivers in the headphones but can cost up to hundreds of dollars.

From the beginning it was our intention to create a true wireless audio experience. In bringing this idea to reality we were compelled to address a variety of needs, create multiple designs, and implement a strategy to cultivate a true wireless audio portfolio. 
During this process we wanted to create a spectrum of earphones to meet the needs of a variety of customers. By offering an affordable product, an everyday lifestyle product, and a premium luxury product, we will be able to share our technology will millions of people around the world. Since releasing the Apollo 7, we are focusing on the user experience and listening to customer feedback while fine tuning the development of the Rio 3 and Muse 5.
Muse 5 Prototypes During our Design Process
Over the past few months, we've worked hard to create a luxury earphone. We've gathered inputs from hundreds of individuals regarding fit and sound quality to create the most comfortable and optimal audio experience for in-ear earphones.

<p>Having the entire season outlined, 4 pilot scripts written and all the main characters designed, the only thing stopping us is funding.</p>
<p>By funding a radio play of the pilot we can finally pitch our cartoon to my contacts at Cartoon Network and Nickelodeon with the idea of developing the full pilot then eventually the entire first season! </p>
<p>If we reach our goal we can make that large creative step into realizing our world, characters and actually get the chance to make this cartoon.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>The funds will go to booking the sound studio and the sound designer to create the actual radio play to be sent out with the season outline, artistic treatment and scripts straight to agents and producers to major cartoon studios.</li>
<li>You will get a choice of original printed character concept art, radio play downloads, scripts prints and credits for the entire cartoon series.</li>
<li>If we do not reach our goal, I will personally fill the financial gaps to ensure the creation of the radio play.</li>

It sits snugly within the palm of your hand, making it very convenient to carry around. The Cannon portable TWS Bluetooth 5.0 speaker will excite you with enhanced audio performance, six hours playtime powered by a rechargeable battery, and noise-reduction built-in mic which supports hands-free phone calls, all in a compact body. Cannon is just perfect for backyard movie nights, parties, travels and a variety of indoor and outdoor activities.  ENJOY TRUE WIRELESS STEREO SOUNDS If you have two Cannon speakers, you can use the TWS function to pair them together to have one play the left channel and the other as the right channel for full stereo sound. The two speakers can be easily and quickly connected via Bluetooth by pressing the button on the side. What’s more great about this stereo mode is that you can mount either speaker to any location you like, to fill the room much better with a more airy and open sound than any other comparable speaker.    Cannon is small in size, but powerful in sound. Cannon features a full metal body, which can deliver a much louder and clearer sound. The sleek design makes it not just a powerful speaker, but also a decoration that can be brought anywhere.  It doesn’t really matter what you’re doing—partying, hiking, camping, having dinner or hanging out. When a speaker this small sounds this amazing, you’ll never want to leave it behind. You can easily take it along in your hand, pocket, or bag.

<strong>THE GROWN-UP WIND DOWN</strong>  </h2>
<h2><strong>An Audio Download Collection</strong></h2>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>THE GENESIS OF THE IDEA:</h3>
<p><strong>What do you do when friends fall asleep to the sound of your voice? </strong></p>
<p>After many years of being left hanging on the phone...""Hello? Hello? Are you still there? Are you SLEEP?""...I've decided to use over a dozen years of experience as a professional writer and audiobook narrator to create a product centered on this unusual skill--putting folks to sleep with the sound of my voice. <strong>THE GROWN-UP WIND DOWN</strong> is a unique mp3 download series that is designed to chill out, calm down, and relax your nerves.  </p>
<p>Inspired by nature, the collection contains five (5) short stories, written in poetic free verse, all approximately 15 minutes in length. So it's a little over an hour of soothing storytelling whose sole purpose is to promote rest, relaxation and a sound sleep.</p>
<p>It's a niche market that is virtually untapped. There are thousands of meditative downloads that include music, nature sounds, raindrops and waterfalls, but nothing quite like <strong>THE GROWN-UP WIND DOWN.</strong> By donating, you'll be the first to take part in the development of an innovative breakthrough in the audiobook industry. <strong>THE GROWN-UP WIND DOWN</strong> gives adult listeners an alternative to similar meditative products. This mp3 audio download is a nostalgic trip back to your childhood when storytelling and sleeptime went hand in hand.</p>
<p>Think of it as bedtime stories for adults. And these aren't stories you've heard before. It's all original. All new. All specifically designed with relaxation in mind.</p>
<p><strong>Series One: The Celestial Series</strong></p>
<p>Short stories, entitled: <strong>SKY /CLOUD /STAR / LIGHT/ MOON</strong></p>
<p><strong>Other planned series include:</strong></p>
<p>The Orchid Series</p>

<p>The Jazz Series</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>BRIEF BIO:</h3>
<p>As a writer, I've written everything from poetry to essays to books and stage plays. Most recently, I've published several works of literary nonfiction centered on jazz. I am the author of the critically-acclaimed biography <strong>HAZEL SCOTT: The Pioneering Journey of a Jazz Pianist from Café Society to Hollywood to HUAC</strong> <strong>(University of Michigan Press)<em>.</em></strong> <em>JAZZ TIMES</em> wrote: <em>""Perhaps the highest compliment one can pay to this fine biography is that during the first 150 pages the reader is wondering why Scott isn’t better known, at least in the jazz world. But by the story’s end…the same reader knows exactly why, but is still likely to be singing her praises as a true trailblazer in African-American culture."" </em></p>
<p>I also co-authored <strong>I WISH YOU LOVE</strong>, the jazz memoir of legendary vocalist, Gloria Lynne <strong>(St. Martin’s Press)</strong><em>.</em> The autobiography was a critical success, receiving an outstanding review from the industry journal, Publishers Weekly, which stated:  <em>“Full of gossip, exclamation and vernacular, it’s a book that demands to be read out loud.  This is a moving tribute to the crucible of Harlem jazz.”</em> As a contributor to the recent publication <strong>AIN’T NOTHING LIKE THE REAL THING: How the Apollo Theater Shaped American Entertainment (Smithsonian Books)</strong>, my essay on blues legend Bessie Smith is featured. </p>

<p>My work as an actor runs the gamut--from film to tv to theater. I often joke that I write to support my acting habit. But really, it's the other way around. My voice has been my 'ace in the hole,' my bread-and-butter, my steady source for over a decade when tv/film &amp; theater work wasn't exactly 'on and poppin'.  I've been fortunate enough to work as a voiceover actor and narrator for over 13 years. My voice can be heard on numerous national network television, radio and internet advertising campaigns. (Check out V/O samples on my professional website <a href=""http://www.karen-chilton.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.karen-chilton.com</a>) I've narrated dozens and dozens of audiobooks (I've actually lost count); some recent notable books include <strong>THE</strong> <strong>NEW JIM CROW </strong>by Michelle Alexander, <strong>HARLEM IS NOWHERE </strong>by Sharifa Rhodes-Pitts, <strong>STANDING TALL</strong> by C.

On the flip side, a small pair of bluetooth earbuds could fall out of your ears and get lost while exercising. And if the sun was out, you likely wore a pair of sunglasses to deflect some of the glare coming from the sun’s light.

For one, when you covered your ears, you can hear the sound of your voice through bone conduction. For another, some bone conduction hearing aid has been approved by FDA, suggesting that it will not do any harm to human body. </p><p><strong>Q: Are the glasses waterproof?</strong></p><p>A: LET Glasses come with an IP65 waterproof rate, which means they can be used in an outside setting and are water-resistant but they are not waterproof and are not suitable to be submerged. </p><p><strong>Q: How long is the battery?</strong></p><p>A: The standby is 10 days. For normal use like taking phone calls and listening to music for 1 hour per day. It can last 2-3 days.</p><p><strong>Q: When the prescription details and survey will be required?</strong></p><p>A: We will send a survey as soon as our campaign ends to confirm shipping address and prescription details, but you will still be able to edit your information before we ship in May 2018.</p><p><strong>Q: What's the differences between the different frames? How can I choose between them?</strong></p><p>You may find the size details of the 3 frames under the section ""Choose Your Glasses"" of our campaign page. To specify, the BASIC comes with half frame, the MODERN is round, and the VINTAGE is somewhat square. You can choose it according to your preference.</p><p><strong>Q: I have myopia. I need to wear glasses with prescription lenses. How can I get them?</strong><br/>A: After the event, we will send out a questionnaire asking for each backer’s prescription information and our lens manufacturer will produce the lenses according to your requests.</p><p><strong>Q: Which type of lenses should I choose?</strong><br/>A: If you have myopia, then choose the photochromic transition lens with a prescription, if you do not need to correct vision and prefer to wear them as sunglasses, you can choose non-corrective photochromic transition lens. If you like outdoor activities, you can choose the polarized lens.</p><p><strong>Q: Can I replace the original lenses with my own lenses?</strong><br/>A: It depends on which frame style you choose. BASIC is half-framed, so basically you cannot change it on your own. You need to find a professional for the exchange. The other two styles (MODERN and VINTAGE) are full-framed, and you can change them by yourself with our interchangeable lenses. For example, if you need to change the blue-light-filtering lenses to the polarized lenses, you can change it by yourself. </p><p><strong>Q: How can I choose the style and color of the glasses? When can I choose them?</strong><br/>A: After the campaign, we will send a questionnaire to each backer to collect your preference request and other related information.</p><p><strong>Q: What is the range available for prescription lenses?</strong><br/>A:   SPH: 0/-8.00 CYL: 0/-2.00</p><p><strong>Q: Are there more lens options in addition to the polarized lens and the regular/corrective photochromic transition lens?</strong><br/>A: Currently we only offer these three types of lens, since they are the most commonly used lens type.</p><p><strong>Q: Can I use it as my headset?</strong><br/>A: Yes in most cases. The bone conduction technology transfers sound through the bone of our skull, so it does not block our ears. You can still hear the surroundings while listening to the sound from LET Glass, assuring you a safe experience.</p><p><strong>Q: Are there lens for correcting astigmatism?</strong><br/>A: Yes. You can choose the Photochromic transition lens and specify the degree of astigmatism (0~-2.00) you need in the questionnaire we will send you.</p><p><strong>Q: Is there a warranty?</strong><br/>A: We provide a one-year warranty for product defects</p><p><strong>Q: What types of phones are LET Glass compatible with?</strong><br/>A: LET glasses are compatible with phones with an Andriod or iOS system.</p><p><strong>Q: Does it come with a charger?</strong><br/>A: No. but it comes with a magnetic power cord with a standard Type A USB interface.</p><p> </p><h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Risks and Challenges</h2><p><strong>1. Glasses Prescription</strong></p><p>We provide prescription lenses for photochromic transition lens. It is a big challenge for us because everyone has a different degree of myopia, different IPD, so every pair of glasses is customized. To solve this problem, we need every backer to provide us the correct prescription, including the degree of myopia, the degree of astigmatism, IPD and other related information.</p><p><strong>2. Shipping Risk</strong></p><p>Since our AI glasses are electronic products that contain lithium batteries inside, shipping by Air is not an option for LET glasses going to certain countries. Backers from these countries have to expect a longer delivery time, since their packages can only be mailed by Sea.</p><p><strong>3. Regulatory compliance</strong></p><p>In the United States, myopia glasses are considered medical devices that require FDA certification. Our lens has FDA certification, but we need to apply for FDA certification for the frame. We will work with our manufacturers to obtain the FDA certificate.</p><p><strong>4. FCC/CE</strong></p><p>Up to now, we have completed production and functional verification of the prototype. We will then go through FCC / CE testing and certification. In this phase, it is possible that we identify some unexpected design flaws. If it happens, we have to optimize our design based on the testing result.</p><p><strong>Promoted By</strong></p><p><strong><a href=""http://lemorelab.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1517539525/envxo6vxgwfevvdlqxnr.jpg"" src=""""/></a></strong></p></div>","＃Update: 100K Stretch Goal Reached, Unlock Charging Case, Thank you all!#Update: Over 50 % funded in 24 hours with Guideline for choosing frames and lenses.—  Meet LET Glass —Meet LET Glass, the innovative spectacles that combine headphones and glasses to offer you the most convenient solution for audio entertainment and visual protection.

If you have been bothered by blue light emitting from the computer screen, a pair of blue light filtering lenses could shield your eyes from the harmful effects. If you want to get rid of glare reflected from natural light, polarized lenses could be the solution.If you are a fan of photochromic transition lens, they are offered as a premium option. You could add a single prescription to photochromic transition lens or just keep it as plain glasses. After our campaign closes, we’ll send out a survey for you to customize your prescription lenses.Specifications  What's In The BoxPerks Timeline Product Story—  Aim for Key Values and Utility  —Remember the last time you went jogging? Your phone was well fastened to your arm with the wired earbuds placed in your ears. As you ran forward, the wire from the earphones likley kept getting in the way of the natural swing of your arms. On the flip side, a small pair of bluetooth earbuds could fall out of your ears and get lost while exercising. And if the sun was out, you likely wore a pair of sunglasses to deflect some of the glare coming from the sun’s light. Now there is a new product that combines earsbuds and glasses into one revolutionary device: LET VisionAI Glasses.

Designing

Testing and debuggingLET Lab designed a pair of glasses that integrates voice interaction, calls and music to meet the challenges of an active lifestyle.With LET VisionAI Glasses, you no longer have to worry about getting distracted while driving when you want to activate the GPS navigation system. And you can quickly answer an incoming call without scrambling to find your phone. By simply tapping it, LET VisionAI Glasses make multitasking a simpler and more efficient process. About the TeamWe're a startup company focusing on smart hardware development, aiming to build the highest-quality and most cost-effective audio-visual products for consumers. Our team gathered a group of innovative engineers who have years of experience in the manufacturing and development areas.Inspired by the AI technology, we designed LET VisionAI Glasses to re-define what a pair of glasses can do. As our research keeps moving forward, more cutting-edge consumer products from LET Lab will improve your life!Campaign by   FAQQ: Will Bone Conduction Harm My Brain?A: Bone conduction is a very common phenomenon. For one, when you covered your ears, you can hear the sound of your voice through bone conduction. For another, some bone conduction hearing aid has been approved by FDA, suggesting that it will not do any harm to human body. Q: Are the glasses waterproof?A: LET Glasses come with an IP65 waterproof rate, which means they can be used in an outside setting and are water-resistant but they are not waterproof and are not suitable to be submerged. Q: How long is the battery?A: The standby is 10 days. For normal use like taking phone calls and listening to music for 1 hour per day. It can last 2-3 days.Q: When the prescription details and survey will be required?A: We will send a survey as soon as our campaign ends to confirm shipping address and prescription details, but you will still be able to edit your information before we ship in May 2018.Q: What's the differences between the different frames? How can I choose between them?You may find the size details of the 3 frames under the section ""Choose Your Glasses"" of our campaign page. To specify, the BASIC comes with half frame, the MODERN is round, and the VINTAGE is somewhat square. You can choose it according to your preference.Q: I have myopia. I need to wear glasses with prescription lenses. How can I get them?A: After the event, we will send out a questionnaire asking for each backer’s prescription information and our lens manufacturer will produce the lenses according to your requests.Q: Which type of lenses should I choose?A: If you have myopia, then choose the photochromic transition lens with a prescription, if you do not need to correct vision and prefer to wear them as sunglasses, you can choose non-corrective photochromic transition lens. If you like outdoor activities, you can choose the polarized lens.Q: Can I replace the original lenses with my own lenses?A: It depends on which frame style you choose. BASIC is half-framed, so basically you cannot change it on your own. You need to find a professional for the exchange. The other two styles (MODERN and VINTAGE) are full-framed, and you can change them by yourself with our interchangeable lenses. For example, if you need to change the blue-light-filtering lenses to the polarized lenses, you can change it by yourself. Q: How can I choose the style and color of the glasses? When can I choose them?A: After the campaign, we will send a questionnaire to each backer to collect your preference request and other related information.Q: What is the range available for prescription lenses?A:   SPH: 0/-8.00 CYL: 0/-2.00Q: Are there more lens options in addition to the polarized lens and the regular/corrective photochromic transition lens?A: Currently we only offer these three types of lens, since they are the most commonly used lens type.Q: Can I use it as my headset?A: Yes in most cases. The bone conduction technology transfers sound through the bone of our skull, so it does not block our ears. You can still hear the surroundings while listening to the sound from LET Glass, assuring you a safe experience.Q: Are there lens for correcting astigmatism?A: Yes. You can choose the Photochromic transition lens and specify the degree of astigmatism (0~-2.00) you need in the questionnaire we will send you.Q: Is there a warranty?A: We provide a one-year warranty for product defectsQ: What types of phones are LET Glass compatible with?A: LET glasses are compatible with phones with an Andriod or iOS system.Q: Does it come with a charger?A: No. but it comes with a magnetic power cord with a standard Type A USB interface. Risks and Challenges1. Glasses PrescriptionWe provide prescription lenses for photochromic transition lens. It is a big challenge for us because everyone has a different degree of myopia, different IPD, so every pair of glasses is customized. To solve this problem, we need every backer to provide us the correct prescription, including the degree of myopia, the degree of astigmatism, IPD and other related information.2. Shipping RiskSince our AI glasses are electronic products that contain lithium batteries inside, shipping by Air is not an option for LET glasses going to certain countries. Backers from these countries have to expect a longer delivery time, since their packages can only be mailed by Sea.3. Regulatory complianceIn the United States, myopia glasses are considered medical devices that require FDA certification. Our lens has FDA certification, but we need to apply for FDA certification for the frame. We will work with our manufacturers to obtain the FDA certificate.4. FCC/CEUp to now, we have completed production and functional verification of the prototype. We will then go through FCC / CE testing and certification. In this phase, it is possible that we identify some unexpected design flaws. If it happens, we have to optimize our design based on the testing result.Promoted By",40.0,7,"1 Campaign

Along with an intuitive control system, Firefly lets you stay powered for up to 16 hours. Unlike other wireless earphones, we worked closely with our suppliers to engineer the best performing battery technology on the market.   
With just a 10 minute charge, enjoy up to 2 hours of playtime or 4 hours of premium music with only a 30-minute charge. And the Firefly also comes with USB Type-C charging case and cable.
 


Compatible with Siri and Google Assistant, access your personal assistants with its quick and easy access button function.   
Get all the information delivered straight to your ears. Plan a beach trip with friends hands-free. Access Siri or Google Assistant with a single tap to see what the weather is like and who’s free this weekend.
 


Bike, climb, lift, or hike without the fear of losing your earphones. With more than 14 years of experience, we have designed the best ear tips to perfectly fit your ears without falling even during the most rigorous activities. Tested with 100+ human ears, the Firefly has the best fit for all-day comfort.
Note: If you lose one Firefly earphone, we sell individual earphones as well.
 


To accompany the best fitting earphones, we had to incorporate the finest sound quality. Firefly utilized Graphene to construct a rigid nanomembrane that’s 100 times harder than steel with only a fraction of the weight. By doing so, it improves the sound quality, treble enhancements, noise isolation, and overall sound quality.

Don’t you hate it when the sound doesn’t sync up with the video? Sound latency and unstable connections are always major problems for Bluetooth devices. However, with Firefly’s ultra-stable Bluetooth connectivity, that’s a thing of the past.
It’s engineered with the latest Bluetooth 5.0 connection and has a functioning range of up to 33 ft, 2 times faster connection and data transmission speed compared to Bluetooth 4.2, so you’ll never have to miss a sound again.
And with its automatic pairing software, just take your Firefly out of its case and they will automatically connect to the previously paired device in less than a second.

The Firefly is equipped with IPX5 water-proof.
 
Keep your earphones dry while you’re not. Firefly is IPX5 waterproof. This means Firefly can withstand the pressure of a gushing nozzle for at least 3 mins. You might not encounter gushing nozzles anytime soon, but can now feel at ease when it rains.
Unlike other earphones that break due to water, sweat corrosion or air moisture, Firefly also adopted a patented water safe nano coating by LIQUIPEL to protect against all the elements. Now, you can get wet, but your earphones doesn’t have to.

Combined with the ambient sound technology, Firefly is here to keep your pump and safe while you’re hiking, climbing, running, biking, or anything else you’re into.
 


Give people your full attention. At Firefly, we have engineered the latest telecommunication technology to free you from any restrictions. Make calls and talk conveniently through both the earphones.

 


 


 


 


Making it as easy as possible, we’ve included everything you need to connect and activate the Firefly earphones immediately.

<p>From: Adam Blair<br/><i>Founder, PUMP Audio</i><br/><br/>PUMP Audio was inspired by our shared love of Dance Music.</p>
<p>We realised that there was a large segment of the headphone market that wasn't being catered for - namely people who love Electronic Dance Music (EDM).<br/></p>
<p>Most of the World's leading headphone manufacturers make headphones with a “flat frequency response”, meaning that they reproduce slavishly the sound that’s fed in to them, giving every frequency exactly the same priority.</p>
<p>That can be great for certain genres of music, such as Classical and Rock.</p>
<p>But for other genres such as Dance Music, the music sounds <u>much</u> better when the sub-bass is given more priority, giving a 'richer' or <i>'warmer'</i> sound signature.</p>
<p>Headphones that have a flat frequency response can sound just that: flat.</p>
<p>So we developed PUMP Zeus <i><b>specifically</b></i> for Dance Music, with <i>amazing</i> bass, crisp <i>(but not severe)</i> highs, and slightly suppressed mids to give an incredibly rich and immersive ""club sound"".<br/></p>

<h1 style=""text-align: center;"">SOUND:<br/>
</h1>Sound is the most important element in any set of PUMP headphones.<br/><br/>Zeus reproduces sub-bass like no other headphones we have ever encountered, without neglecting the rest of the frequency range.<br/><br/>We don't do gimmicks or crazy new technologies. We just make the best sounding headphones in the World <i>(in our - not so humble - opinion!)</i> for people who love EDM genres like Drum &amp; Bass, Jungle, Trance, House, Techno, Hardcore, Trap, Electro, and so on...<br/><br/>If you've already got a set of PUMP In-Ear then I suspect you’ll need no convincing about how they sound compared to the competition.<br/><br/>PUMP Zeus sound incredible too with the warm, rich, and well defined PUMP Sound Signature.<br/><br/><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">About The PUMP Audio Sound Signature:

<div align=""center""><h3><b style=""background-color: initial;"">Here's a review from one PUMP Zeus pre-production prototype beta tester:</b></h3></div>
<p></p>
<p>Having heard a lot of headphones, ranging from Audio-Technica, Bose, Beats, Sennheiser and a couple of planar headphones, I can definitely say that these head phones are one of the best.<br/><br/>Zeus V2 win hands down against Beats and Bose.<br/><br/>If you want to own Sennheiser HD800 but can't afford it, go for these headphones.<br/><br/>After serious comparison with HD800 and Zeus V2, I can clearly say that Sennheiser's are costly just because they are a brand. Make no mistake, Zeus V2s are some serious headphones which can take on any genre of music and sound perfect in all of them.<br/><br/>There is only one thing which I was expecting in these headphones and that was Active Noise Cancelling. As these have omnidirectional microphones, I don't think it should be a problem to add this feature. Hopefully, this feature would be available with the next firmware/software update.<br/><br/>Overall, if you are trying to find some genuine and unbiased advice in reviews columns, I would say go for it mate, because seriously THESE ARE ONE OF THE BEST SOUNDING HEADPHONES YOUR MONEY COULD BUY.<br/><br/>At last, I just have one request to Adam and whole pump team that, if you could add ANC in your next firmware update that would be awesome. Cheers guys, 9 out of 5 stars !! :) - <i>""<b>God Of Thunder</b>""<br/></i></p>
<i>*  all beta testers paid for their PUMP Zeus, albeit at a discounted rate</i><b style=""background-color: initial;""><br/><br/>I’ll be clear: In our opinion, these are some of the best sounding headphones in the World, at any price.<br/></b><p><b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1467044652/pump_zeus_line_qauitj.png"" src="""" style=""""/></b></p>
<figure style=""margin: 0px;""><h1 style=""text-align: center;"">WIRELESS FUNCTIONALITY:</h1>This is what took us an estimated 520 man hours to perfect, even after we thought we were there a <i>whole year ago!</i><br/><br/>It’s <i>easy </i>to make a set of headphones wireless, if you’re not <b>obsessive</b> about recreating the sound signature and quality perfectly.<br/><br/>The initial version of PUMP Zeus from a year back had an issue where sub-bass (frequencies under 60Hz) was distorting slightly.<br/><br/>A lot of music doesn’t even <i>have</i> sub-bass in it, and a lot of people who tried the first batch of pre-production prototypes tried to persuade us that the sound quality was amazing and that there wasn’t actually a problem.<br/><br/></figure>
<p>However, we couldn’t bring ourselves to accept anything less than perfection, and so we set about in pursuit of it.</p>
<p><b>We're now confident to challenge anyone to tell the difference between when their PUMP Zeus is plugged in with an audio cable, and when they are listening via Bluetooth.</b></p>

<p>We've tested a LOT of over ears during the long development process from all major brands and it’s shocking how some of them seem to have totally disregarded comfort.</p>
<p>Beats do a good job with their <i>Studio </i>model in my opinion, but I really can’t imagine what SMS Audio and AKG were thinking when they considered comfort!</p>
<p>The important thing about comfort, is that we’ve made PUMP Zeus very comfortable for<b> anyone</b>.</p>
<p>Everyone who has tried them during the late development process agrees that they are really comfortable both <i>on your head <b>and</b> around your neck.</i></p>
<p></p>

<p><br/>It would have been possible to build some <i>slightly</i> more comfortable headphones, but it would have been at the expense of sound quality and wireless functionality.</p>
<p>For example, we could have made them a little bit lighter by using a smaller battery. But this would have shortened the battery life to a level we weren’t happy with.</p>
<p>Or we could have used even softer ear cup foam, or changed the tension of the cans against the head, but this would have meant that the drivers weren’t at a controlled distance from the ear, meaning hit and miss sound quality.</p>

<p>Functionality is <b>really important</b> in our opinion, particularly if you are going to use your PUMP Zeus to make and receive calls.</p>
<p>We worked hard to make the controls intuitive after a very short time, so that you <i>instinctively </i>know how to answer a call, decline a call, hang up a call, jump forward a track, jump back a track, turn the volume up or down and so on…</p>
<p>Within 10 minutes of playing with your new set of PUMP Zeus, you’ll know exactly how they work.</p>
<p>For our non-techy Friends who just want to plug and play -- <i>I know there aren't too many non-techies on Indiegogo, but anyway...</i> -- you can do that by using the audio cable, or by switching your PUMP Zeus on and connecting to the Bluetooth on your phone or music player.</p>

<p>Two things that we were adamant about from the start were that:</p>
<p>a) <b>PUMP Zeus should have a built in battery</b> (unlike many competing products, which need AA or AAA batteries to work!);</p>
<p>b) <b>If the battery runs out, you should just be able to plug an audio cable in and continue listening</b> with <i>no degradation in sound quality,</i> even though they are no longer “powered”.</p>
<p>We were amazed that some competing brands stop working ALTOGETHER when the batteries run out! Imagine you’re 4 hours in to an 11 hour flight and that happens…</p>
<p>With PUMP Zeus, when the battery eventually runs out (after about 8 hours of constant use), just plug the audio cable in and carry on listening with exactly the same audio quality and volume.</p>

We thought it would be a really unique idea to make PUMP Zeus <i>stand up by themselves</i>. The original idea came from not having an alternative option to wearing around your neck on an aeroplane (with PUMP Zeus you can just stand them up on the table in front of you)<br/><br/>
<p>Other benefits are that if you want to store them outside of the carry case — who can be bothered to put them away every time you use them? — they store neatly on a book case or desk.</p>

We realised that there was a large segment of the headphone market that wasn't being catered for - namely people who love Electronic Dance Music (EDM).
Most of the World's leading headphone manufacturers make headphones with a “flat frequency response”, meaning that they reproduce slavishly the sound that’s fed in to them, giving every frequency exactly the same priority.
That can be great for certain genres of music, such as Classical and Rock.
But for other genres such as Dance Music, the music sounds much better when the sub-bass is given more priority, giving a 'richer' or 'warmer' sound signature.
Headphones that have a flat frequency response can sound just that: flat.
So we developed PUMP Zeus specifically for Dance Music, with amazing bass, crisp (but not severe) highs, and slightly suppressed mids to give an incredibly rich and immersive ""club sound"".


The areas we decided were the most important early on in development -- in order of importance -- were:
1) Sound 2) Wireless functionality (*without perceptible loss* of sound quality) 3) Comfort 4) Functionality 5) Look


SOUND:
Sound is the most important element in any set of PUMP headphones.Zeus reproduces sub-bass like no other headphones we have ever encountered, without neglecting the rest of the frequency range.We don't do gimmicks or crazy new technologies. We just make the best sounding headphones in the World (in our - not so humble - opinion!) for people who love EDM genres like Drum & Bass, Jungle, Trance, House, Techno, Hardcore, Trap, Electro, and so on...If you've already got a set of PUMP In-Ear then I suspect you’ll need no convincing about how they sound compared to the competition.PUMP Zeus sound incredible too with the warm, rich, and well defined PUMP Sound Signature.About The PUMP Audio Sound Signature:





Here's a review from one PUMP Zeus pre-production prototype beta tester:

Having heard a lot of headphones, ranging from Audio-Technica, Bose, Beats, Sennheiser and a couple of planar headphones, I can definitely say that these head phones are one of the best.Zeus V2 win hands down against Beats and Bose.If you want to own Sennheiser HD800 but can't afford it, go for these headphones.After serious comparison with HD800 and Zeus V2, I can clearly say that Sennheiser's are costly just because they are a brand. Make no mistake, Zeus V2s are some serious headphones which can take on any genre of music and sound perfect in all of them.There is only one thing which I was expecting in these headphones and that was Active Noise Cancelling. As these have omnidirectional microphones, I don't think it should be a problem to add this feature. Hopefully, this feature would be available with the next firmware/software update.Overall, if you are trying to find some genuine and unbiased advice in reviews columns, I would say go for it mate, because seriously THESE ARE ONE OF THE BEST SOUNDING HEADPHONES YOUR MONEY COULD BUY.At last, I just have one request to Adam and whole pump team that, if you could add ANC in your next firmware update that would be awesome. Cheers guys, 9 out of 5 stars !! :) - ""God Of Thunder""
*  all beta testers paid for their PUMP Zeus, albeit at a discounted rateI’ll be clear: In our opinion, these are some of the best sounding headphones in the World, at any price.
WIRELESS FUNCTIONALITY:This is what took us an estimated 520 man hours to perfect, even after we thought we were there a whole year ago!It’s easy to make a set of headphones wireless, if you’re not obsessive about recreating the sound signature and quality perfectly.The initial version of PUMP Zeus from a year back had an issue where sub-bass (frequencies under 60Hz) was distorting slightly.A lot of music doesn’t even have sub-bass in it, and a lot of people who tried the first batch of pre-production prototypes tried to persuade us that the sound quality was amazing and that there wasn’t actually a problem.
However, we couldn’t bring ourselves to accept anything less than perfection, and so we set about in pursuit of it.
We're now confident to challenge anyone to tell the difference between when their PUMP Zeus is plugged in with an audio cable, and when they are listening via Bluetooth.


COMFORT:We made PUMP Zeus really comfortable – both when worn on your head, or around your neck.

Notice how the ear cups are not touching Nicole's chin — as happens with many over ear headphones when worn around the neck — even though she is looking down slightly. That’s the level of attention we gave to Comfort on the PUMP Zeus project.
We've tested a LOT of over ears during the long development process from all major brands and it’s shocking how some of them seem to have totally disregarded comfort.
Beats do a good job with their Studio model in my opinion, but I really can’t imagine what SMS Audio and AKG were thinking when they considered comfort!
The important thing about comfort, is that we’ve made PUMP Zeus very comfortable for anyone.
Everyone who has tried them during the late development process agrees that they are really comfortable both on your head and around your neck.

We’ve achieved this level of comfort without compromising sound quality.
It would have been possible to build some slightly more comfortable headphones, but it would have been at the expense of sound quality and wireless functionality.
For example, we could have made them a little bit lighter by using a smaller battery. But this would have shortened the battery life to a level we weren’t happy with.
Or we could have used even softer ear cup foam, or changed the tension of the cans against the head, but this would have meant that the drivers weren’t at a controlled distance from the ear, meaning hit and miss sound quality.
We’ve made PUMP Zeus really comfortable. Probably not the most comfortable headphones in the World, but one of the most – both on your head and around your neck.
FUNCTIONALITY:



Functionality is really important in our opinion, particularly if you are going to use your PUMP Zeus to make and receive calls.
We worked hard to make the controls intuitive after a very short time, so that you instinctively know how to answer a call, decline a call, hang up a call, jump forward a track, jump back a track, turn the volume up or down and so on…
Within 10 minutes of playing with your new set of PUMP Zeus, you’ll know exactly how they work.
For our non-techy Friends who just want to plug and play -- I know there aren't too many non-techies on Indiegogo, but anyway... -- you can do that by using the audio cable, or by switching your PUMP Zeus on and connecting to the Bluetooth on your phone or music player.




Two things that we were adamant about from the start were that:
a) PUMP Zeus should have a built in battery (unlike many competing products, which need AA or AAA batteries to work!);
b) If the battery runs out, you should just be able to plug an audio cable in and continue listening with no degradation in sound quality, even though they are no longer “powered”.
We were amazed that some competing brands stop working ALTOGETHER when the batteries run out! Imagine you’re 4 hours in to an 11 hour flight and that happens…
With PUMP Zeus, when the battery eventually runs out (after about 8 hours of constant use), just plug the audio cable in and carry on listening with exactly the same audio quality and volume.




We thought it would be a really unique idea to make PUMP Zeus stand up by themselves. The original idea came from not having an alternative option to wearing around your neck on an aeroplane (with PUMP Zeus you can just stand them up on the table in front of you)
Other benefits are that if you want to store them outside of the carry case — who can be bothered to put them away every time you use them? — they store neatly on a book case or desk.


LOOK:
We wanted a look that didn't follow the crowd. Form has definitely followed function with PUMP Zeus, and we happen to think they look pretty nice! 
For the PUMP Zeus Launch, we'll be offering them in Black with Orange flashes.If it goes well, we'll introduce a stretch goal that will allow Backers to choose some other colours too!I know that some of our Friends really like the idea of having a bright Orange set, and these will no doubt follow in the near future.We decided to go with Black for the first production because from feedback, we realised it had the most mass appeal.

- They Sound incredible for Dance Music (and pretty awesome for other genres aswell!);- Wireless Bluetooth;- Battery lasts up to 8 hours on a full charge;- When the battery runs out, just plug in the audio cable and carry on listening with no degradationin sound quality (even though they are no longer powered);- 5 year warranty;- 60 day Risk Free Trial to prove what we say about the incredible, immersive sound, and the reproduction of sub-bass is true! (see below)Such is our faith in the build quality of PUMP Zeus that we are happy to offer Backers a FIVE YEAR Warranty!What doesn’t it cover? The obvious, really: Loss or theft, or damage caused by misuse.That's where PUMPreplace comes in...If you damage or break your PUMP Zeus, fear not… We definitely don’t want to leave you in the lurch just because you had an accident or lent them to someone who’s a bit too heavy handed.That’s why we're offering Backers PUMPreplace. Just get in touch with a copy of your receipt and a picture of your damaged PUMP Zeus and we’ll arrange another set for you (minus the packaging, accessories, manuals etc. that you already have) at a heavily subsidised price.This price may change a little from time to time, but it will always be a fraction of the “new” price, so just ask us what it is currently.I know that this is a bit unusual for a Indiegogo project, but we would like to propose the following:If you back us, and at any time within 60 days of the date you receive your PUMP Zeus they don't live up to your expectations, we will refund your backing amount in full.All you have to do is email or call us and we will honour this guarantee.I know that a lot of headphones make bold claims vaguely alluding to the fact that they have amazing sound quality, but then when you listen to them it's hard to distinguish much of a difference.With PUMP Zeus we are categorically stating that you will immediately be able to hear that they sound significantly better than any headphones you have ever heard before.A bold claim, and that is exactly why we are offering such a guarantee!We're expecting a very small take up on the guarantee, but it's there to give you confidence that what we are saying about the PUMP sound quality is true.I'd like to invite our Friends on Indiegogo to ""Take The PUMP Challenge"" and try PUMP Zeus for yourself with the 60 Day Risk Free Trail.I promise, you will be wowed by the sound experience and everyone at PUMP Audio would like to say a big ""Thankyou"" to all our Backers who have helped to bring PUMP Zeus to the World.

<p>RippleBuds has a great competitive edge when it comes to strepitous environments. Our Noisy Blocking Technology physically intercepts ambient noise around the user due to the non-traditional positioning of the RippleBuds microphone. Upon realizing the voice is emitted through the mouth AND ear, the RippleBuds' team placed a microphone in the human ear to effectively eliminate all sounds besides the voice. By doing this, we found an original way to capture the human voice from an entirely new source. This amounted in the birth of RippleBuds and the discovery of an innovative solution for modern-day communication. </p>

<p>While traveling, RippleBuds CEO, Shin Dusik, constantly found himself on the phone in noisy, public places, making his conversations very difficult, personally and professionally. After losing a client to an inaudible phone meeting and having conversations cut short with multiple family members and friends, Shin decided it was time to create a solution for this common problem. </p>
<p>While at an exhibition in 2005, Shin (accidentally) discovered a small portion of the voice comes out of the ear when we speak. From there, he discovered placing a microphone in the ear effectively eliminates all sound besides the voice. Shin realized if someone could develop a microphone small enough to fit in the ear, phone conversations could finally be clear. </p>
<p>In 2012, as small, functioning components became available to market, Shin quit his job and developed a team to design unique earbuds that eased the growing pains of modern day, on-the-go communication. By replacing the mouthpiece found in most headsets with a microphone that fits invisibly inside the ear, RippleBuds was born. </p>
<p>Today, we have <b>115 registered and pending patents </b>across various IPs in at least nine countries.</p>
<p>The RippleBuds’ team is thrilled to introduce Shin’s innovative solution to you and your ears.</p>

<h1>FAQS</h1>
</div><div> </div><p><b>Are there other earbuds like this available?</b></p><div>Currently, we are the only one company to produce earbuds which you can speak trough the ear. To prevent from other companies to imitate our products, we have filed many patents and intellectual properties in number of countries.</div><div> </div><div><b>Do I really need two RippleBuds or can I just get one?</b></div><div>You can always use just one RippleBuds. If you are a music lover and want to listen to music in stereo, then go for stereo.</div><div> </div><div><b>What colors do RippleBuds come in?</b></div><div>They come in two colors; ""Black"" and ""Silver (recharging capsule) &amp; White (earbuds)""</div><div> </div><div><b>Can you exercise with RippleBuds?</b></div><div><p>Absolutely, as the earbuds is sweat proof, the users can enjoy music while they are exercising. <span style='letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>Also the earpads are washable, they can remove it from the earbuds and wash it after sweaty exercise.</span></p></div><div><b>How secure are RippleBuds in-ear?</b></div><div><p>As we provide 5 sizes of earpads, the users can find the ones that fit the best to their ear sizes.  <span style='letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>In addition, the 3 fins on the earpads will further prevent the earbuds to fall out of your ears.</span></p></div><div><b>Can I connect RippleBuds with my car’s Bluetooth system?</b></div><div>No, but you can connect RippleBuds to your phone and use it while driving.</div><div> </div><div><b>If RippleBuds are wireless, how does it connect with my phone?</b></div><div>To connect RippleBuds to your phone, you will need to enable Bluetooth mode and press and hold the power button on RippleBuds. You will hear a voice ""pairing mode"" from the earbud. Once RippleBuds is displayed on your phone, you can tap on it to pair RippleBuds to your phone.</div><div> </div><div><b>Are RippleBuds compatible with iPhones and Androids?</b></div><div>Yes, RippleBuds are compatible with any device as long as they are Bluetooth enabled.</div><div> </div><div><b>How are RippleBuds powered?</b></div><div>RippleBuds are powered by a micro USB cable that plugs into a regular power outlet.</div><div> </div><div><b>Will RippleBuds work for people who are hearing impaired?</b></div><div>No. However, it is possible to prevent hearing impairment. Many people suffer from hearing impairment due to exposure to high levels of noise/music for extended period of time. Our specially designed earpads will reduce the external noises going into the user’s ear so the user don’t have to increase the volume too much to compensate from losing the sound by the external noises.</div><div> </div><div><b>Does RippleBuds use Bone Conduction?</b></div><div>RippleBuds does not use Bone Conduction microphone or speaker. Our specially designed microphones in RippleBuds will capture the ACTUAL VOICE leaking though the ear canal. We don’t capture vibrations from the skull bone. Therefore, the voice quality of RippleBuds is much better than the Bone Conduction devices on the market. Also our patented technology will prevent echoing and howling to occur even though they are installed closely in the tiny little earbuds together. Thus we can use sound speaker next to the microphone.</div><div> </div><div><b>How loud are RippleBuds?</b></div><div>Output sound : 92.7dB +- 3dB at 1KHz</div><div> </div><div><b>Can you listen to music with RippleBuds?</b></div><div>Absolutely. While not using RippleBuds for talking you can use RippleBuds to enjoy music wirelessly.</div><div> </div><div><b>Who are RippleBuds designed for?</b></div><div>
<p>RippleBuds are designed for people who value clear communication. </p>
<p>RippleBuds can benefit people including: Car drivers, Cyclists, City Commuters, Military members, Police officers, Firefighters, Security guards, Construction/Factory workers, Airport employees, Event workers, Call Center Representatives, Concert-goers, Entrepreneurs and Working Professionals, Athletes, Sailors, and Beach Goers</p>
</div><div><b>In functionality and technology, is buying two Mono Ripplebud units the same as buying one set of Stereo Ripplebuds?</b></div><div>No, it is not the same. Even though you purchase two Mono RippleBuds units, you can’t use them both at the same time to listen to music in stereo. You can only listen to music in stereo with the Stereo RippleBuds units.</div><div> </div><div><b>What is your warranty?</b></div><div>We have a standard 1 year manufacturer’s limited warranty. RippleBuds warrants manufacturing defects and workmanship during this time. If there is any defect during the warranty period, we will repair the product for free of charge or exchange the product with a new product.</div><div> </div><div><b>Is the voice from the ear the same as the voice from the mouth?</b></div><div>Since RippleBuds doesn’t have an outside microphone, our specially designed in-ear microphone picks up the voice directly from the ear excluding the surrounding noise. The voice from the ear is bit different to the voice from the mouth. The voice from the ear has lower frequency response. But we already developed a firmware built into to the unit to enhance the sound quality.</div><div> </div><div><b>Will the left or right RippleBuds work alone for the stereo type?</b></div><div>Yes, either left or right earbud will work alone.</div><div> </div><div><b>What about patents?</b></div><div>Our team members have put 4 years of hard work and research into these technologies and filed around 100 patents and other intellectual properties in 9 countries to protect our technology. Most of the patents are related to the core technologies which can reduce the echo and howling when the speaker and microphone are placed closely together in the tiny earbuds.</div><div> </div><div><b>How do I know if RippleBuds fits into my ear?</b></div><div>We provide five different sizes of earpads to make sure that RippleBuds fits into your ear. We have tested our earpads with many different sizes of the ear models and used various materials to see which one would be the best for the earpad. You can try the different sizes and choose the one that fits you best.</div><div> </div><div><b>What can I do if I lose the earpad?</b></div><div>You can purchase another earpad on our website or our dealer shops.</div><div> </div><div><b>How long can I listen to music or talk on the phone on one charge?</b></div><div>The earbud unit itself lasts for 5 hours of talking/listening time and 110 hours of standby time.</div><div> </div><div><b>What is the battery life and the capacity?</b></div><div>
<p>For the mono type, recharging capsule will provide 6 cycles of recharges to the earbud, allowing 35 hours of talking time on the go when you carry fully recharged earbud and the capsule. </p>
<p>For the stereo type, recharging capsule will provide 3 cycles of recharges to the earbuds (as there are 2 units to recharge), allowing 20 hours of talking time on the go when you carry fully recharged earbud and the capsule. </p>
<p>The battery capacity of earbud itself is 55 mAh.</p>
<p>The battery capacity of the recharging capsule is 310 mAh.</p>
</div><div><b>How can I recharge RippleBuds?</b></div><div>Place the earbuds in the recharging capsule. If the recharging capsule has some power left, the capsule will recharge the earbuds as soon as the buds are placed in the capsule. If the capsule is flat on battery, you can connect the capsule with the enclosed micro USB cable to recharge both the earbuds and the capsule.</div><div> </div><div><b>How long does it take to recharge RippleBuds?</b></div><div>It takes less than two hours to recharge both the earbuds and the recharging capsule.</div><div> </div><div><b>Can I pair RippleBuds to more than one device?</b></div><div>
<p>Yes, you can. To pair your RippleBuds, you need to enable Bluetooth mode and press and hold the power button on the earbud, you will hear a voice ""pairing mode"" from the earbud. Once RippleBuds is displayed you can tap on it to pair RippleBuds to your device. </p>
<p>You can do this with other device to pair it as long as the RippleBuds you are trying to pair is not connected to the other device.</p>
</div><div><b>How much is the shipping and handling?</b></div><div>We provide FREE shipping to USA, Canada, China, Hong Kong and South Korea. A fee of $20 USD will be charged for all the countries.</div><div> </div><div><i>Delivery of rewards/perks are subject to best efforts and not guaranteed.</i></div><div> </div><div style=""text-align: center;"">

RippleBuds is an innovative departure from the traditional headset. Tiny, but powerful, RippleBuds provides maximum comfort with a minimal profile.


RippleBuds comes with five sizes of ear-pads to provide maximum fit for users of all sized ear canals. Additionally, RippleBuds are sweat-proof and ear-pads are washable, making RippleBuds perfect for fitness-enthusiasts.



There’s no need to blast music to overcome a loud environment. RippleBuds' three fin ear-pad design significantly reduces ambient noise while listening to music, preserving your precious hearing.


RippleBuds has a great competitive edge when it comes to strepitous environments. Our Noisy Blocking Technology physically intercepts ambient noise around the user due to the non-traditional positioning of the RippleBuds microphone. Upon realizing the voice is emitted through the mouth AND ear, the RippleBuds' team placed a microphone in the human ear to effectively eliminate all sounds besides the voice. By doing this, we found an original way to capture the human voice from an entirely new source. This amounted in the birth of RippleBuds and the discovery of an innovative solution for modern-day communication. 





Entrepreneurs and Working Professionals: With your busy on-the-go life, you can have meetings and conduct business calls wherever you are. 
Automobile Drivers: Block traffic noises and music when talking on the phone. RippleBuds can also enhance voice command while driving and allows you to be hands free. 
Cyclists: Due to RippleBuds’ Noisy Blocking Technology, the sound of wind is intercepted allowing cyclists to talk and ride. 
City Commuters: No matter how many people surround you on the subway, conversations are crystal-clear. 
Service Workers: Being on-duty leaves you in boisterous environments. When critical situations arise, RippleBuds allows your every word to be heard.
Intensive Labor Workers: There’s nothing louder than a construction site, a plane taking off, or a crowd of cheering fans. RippleBuds allows you to listen to music and have conversations no matter what type of environment you work in. 
Call Center Representatives: With multitudes of people conducting calls at the same time, call center staff members could greatly benefit from RippleBuds. 
Athletes: Workout and go to practice with RippleBuds. Our product is sweat-proof and our ear-pads are washable. 
Sailors and Beach Goers: No more worrying about ocean wind overpowering your voice- we’ve got your back. 
Social Butterflies: Save your voice (and your sanity) – there’s no longer a need to shout when you’re trying to find your friends at a major event or raging party. RippleBuds allows you to clearly communicate despite loud music, large crowds, and cheering fans!

Once RippleBuds is displayed on your phone, you can tap on it to pair RippleBuds to your phone. Are RippleBuds compatible with iPhones and Androids?Yes, RippleBuds are compatible with any device as long as they are Bluetooth enabled. How are RippleBuds powered?RippleBuds are powered by a micro USB cable that plugs into a regular power outlet. Will RippleBuds work for people who are hearing impaired?No. However, it is possible to prevent hearing impairment. Many people suffer from hearing impairment due to exposure to high levels of noise/music for extended period of time. Our specially designed earpads will reduce the external noises going into the user’s ear so the user don’t have to increase the volume too much to compensate from losing the sound by the external noises. Does RippleBuds use Bone Conduction?RippleBuds does not use Bone Conduction microphone or speaker. Our specially designed microphones in RippleBuds will capture the ACTUAL VOICE leaking though the ear canal. We don’t capture vibrations from the skull bone. Therefore, the voice quality of RippleBuds is much better than the Bone Conduction devices on the market. Also our patented technology will prevent echoing and howling to occur even though they are installed closely in the tiny little earbuds together. Thus we can use sound speaker next to the microphone. How loud are RippleBuds?Output sound : 92.7dB +- 3dB at 1KHz Can you listen to music with RippleBuds?Absolutely. While not using RippleBuds for talking you can use RippleBuds to enjoy music wirelessly. Who are RippleBuds designed for?
RippleBuds are designed for people who value clear communication. 
RippleBuds can benefit people including: Car drivers, Cyclists, City Commuters, Military members, Police officers, Firefighters, Security guards, Construction/Factory workers, Airport employees, Event workers, Call Center Representatives, Concert-goers, Entrepreneurs and Working Professionals, Athletes, Sailors, and Beach Goers
In functionality and technology, is buying two Mono Ripplebud units the same as buying one set of Stereo Ripplebuds?No, it is not the same. Even though you purchase two Mono RippleBuds units, you can’t use them both at the same time to listen to music in stereo. You can only listen to music in stereo with the Stereo RippleBuds units. What is your warranty?We have a standard 1 year manufacturer’s limited warranty. RippleBuds warrants manufacturing defects and workmanship during this time. If there is any defect during the warranty period, we will repair the product for free of charge or exchange the product with a new product. Is the voice from the ear the same as the voice from the mouth?Since RippleBuds doesn’t have an outside microphone, our specially designed in-ear microphone picks up the voice directly from the ear excluding the surrounding noise. The voice from the ear is bit different to the voice from the mouth. The voice from the ear has lower frequency response. But we already developed a firmware built into to the unit to enhance the sound quality. Will the left or right RippleBuds work alone for the stereo type?Yes, either left or right earbud will work alone. What about patents?Our team members have put 4 years of hard work and research into these technologies and filed around 100 patents and other intellectual properties in 9 countries to protect our technology. Most of the patents are related to the core technologies which can reduce the echo and howling when the speaker and microphone are placed closely together in the tiny earbuds. How do I know if RippleBuds fits into my ear?We provide five different sizes of earpads to make sure that RippleBuds fits into your ear. We have tested our earpads with many different sizes of the ear models and used various materials to see which one would be the best for the earpad. You can try the different sizes and choose the one that fits you best. What can I do if I lose the earpad?You can purchase another earpad on our website or our dealer shops. How long can I listen to music or talk on the phone on one charge?The earbud unit itself lasts for 5 hours of talking/listening time and 110 hours of standby time. What is the battery life and the capacity?
For the mono type, recharging capsule will provide 6 cycles of recharges to the earbud, allowing 35 hours of talking time on the go when you carry fully recharged earbud and the capsule. 
For the stereo type, recharging capsule will provide 3 cycles of recharges to the earbuds (as there are 2 units to recharge), allowing 20 hours of talking time on the go when you carry fully recharged earbud and the capsule. 
The battery capacity of earbud itself is 55 mAh.
The battery capacity of the recharging capsule is 310 mAh.
How can I recharge RippleBuds?Place the earbuds in the recharging capsule. If the recharging capsule has some power left, the capsule will recharge the earbuds as soon as the buds are placed in the capsule. If the capsule is flat on battery, you can connect the capsule with the enclosed micro USB cable to recharge both the earbuds and the capsule. How long does it take to recharge RippleBuds?It takes less than two hours to recharge both the earbuds and the recharging capsule. Can I pair RippleBuds to more than one device?
Yes, you can. To pair your RippleBuds, you need to enable Bluetooth mode and press and hold the power button on the earbud, you will hear a voice ""pairing mode"" from the earbud. Once RippleBuds is displayed you can tap on it to pair RippleBuds to your device. 
You can do this with other device to pair it as long as the RippleBuds you are trying to pair is not connected to the other device.
How much is the shipping and handling?We provide FREE shipping to USA, Canada, China, Hong Kong and South Korea. A fee of $20 USD will be charged for all the countries. Delivery of rewards/perks are subject to best efforts and not guaranteed.

We have spent the last 10 years working with sound and have previously delivered three highly successful crowdfunding campaigns totalling over £2 million. We especially love trying to reveal more and more detail in sound. Our extensive research in the development of our loudspeakers, earphones and ear protectors has helped us to understand the human ear and how and what we hear. We’ve developed some exciting patents that we have put to great use with our products in delivering clean directional sound. But we wanted to go further... Our ears are wonderful things. Inside them we have some incredible biological kit that helps us to distinguish and identify many different sounds and noises.As our ears are on the side of our head they are especially great at determining where sounds are coming from. The outside of our ear (the Pinna) has evolved to help us do this by distorting sound based on which direction the sound is coming from.This means that what we gain in placement of sound we lose in definition and sound quality. High frequencies in-particular lose their sparkle, definition and sibilance when sound emanates from in front of us. Our ears are very good at receiving quality sound from the sides and from devices like headphones as this sound travels straight into our ears bypassing the Pinna.However, when we put our ears into venues and different shaped acoustic spaces, suddenly we are hearing sound from in front of us. That plays havoc when trying to hear high definition sound because of the interfering reflections coming from all other angles. Sounds from the side (red and yellow) have an easier path to the ear canal which interferes with sound coming from the front. We want to upgrade your ears to let them hear more detail, higher quality sound without just increasing the volume.  We believe that what we’ve created with earHD is a game changer for your ears.In order to receive higher levels of detail from the front earHD acts like a satellite dish. It uses a precise acoustic lens that focuses sound uniformly into one central location. This focused sound is then accurately reflected straight into our ears, revealing higher definition sound from where you are facing.With earHD you can focus on sounds from the front and reduce distracting noises from the side. ""When I’m at the piano It feels like all I hear is music. Total immersion. Which is excellent.Pure, undiluted concentration. Really impressive.” James Rhodes: Classical Pianist  Take your pick...Or choose both!    It's that easy!We want to invite you to join us on an audio exploration. We believe that what we’ve created with earHD is a new exciting tool to open your ears and hear the world in HD.Rediscover your favourite sounds and hear subtleties and nuances that you have been previously unaware of with your new upgraded ears.Ready to open your ears?   earHD uses a 60 degree reception from left to right to focus sound coming into our ears. Simply put: where we look is where we want to hear in high definition, sound coming from elsewhere is blurred out and reduced.Blur out distracting noises and focus on what you want to listen to. We’ve gone through over 50 prototypes with painstaking levels of attention to detail to get it right.Here's just a small handful of prototypes...! earHD dimensions. We hoped that earHD would improve what we hear slightly, but what we achieved has really astonished us and the independent testers we have used.The ISVR (Institute of Sound and Vibration Research) at the University of Southampton has conducted completely independent tests on earHD to verify our claims.earHD surpassed all our expectations. Click here to download the full report.  The Speech Transmission Index Test Part 1 - Speech Intelligibility Source: ISVR Consultancy Report (ref. 10653-R01), page 23/section 6.2 This measured earHD’s performance at how well it can receive the human voice (speech intelligibility) from one sound source emanating from the front.As you can see below, the natural human ear is rated in the lower end of the 'fair' category at an average of 0.49 because of the Pinna distortion we mentioned earlier. Source: ISVR Consultancy Report (ref. 10653-R01), page 19/table 5 Using earHD, we take these results right up to 0.64 when listening to a female voice and 0.62 when listening to a male voice (on average). This is an entire category jump from fair to good. Source: ISVR Consultancy Report (ref. 10653-R01), page 18/table 4 The Speech Transmission Index Test Part 2 - Signal To Noise Ratio 'Signal' is the sound we want to hear and 'Noise' is the sound we don’t want to hear.In this test 'signal' is sound from the front and 'noise' is sound from the side. A dummy head with microphones for ears was set up in an anechoic chamber (yes it was as creepy as it sounds!) The dummy head was surrounded by speakers.Test dummy set up at ISVR measuring signal to noise ratio in the anechoic chamber.At 4kHz we saw an average increase of 9dB in signal to noise ratio. That’s massive! But what’s more impressive is that at 8kHz we saw an average increase of 19dB.Mind Blown.8kHz and up is classed as high frequencies i.e where we hear most detail in sound. Frequency ResponseThe frequency graph below shows the natural human ear with and without earHD.Source: ISVR Consulting Report (ref. 10653-R01), page 11/section 4.1 As you can see the human ear is naturally boosted between 1.5kHz and 6kHz (shown in the pink circle). This is due to the resonance of our ear canals. From 6kHz and above high frequencies in the natural human ear start to roll off - this is particularly noticeable as we get older.

At the same time the precise frequency response we created enables earHD to become directional with high frequency sound, the entire purpose of earHD. Still following?!To summarise, we have a powerful combination:
Improved speech intelligibility
Increased signal to noise ratio
Enhanced frequency response 
This is incredibly exciting but what’s even more impressive is that all these improvements are coming from a small passive (non-electrical) device. Simply look and listen.  earHD can be used in lots of different scenarios to upgrade your listening experience.What will your ears discover?

<p>Muzen Wild Mini uses a large-diameter speaker made from a rare-earth magnet (N40 NdFeB magnet) to optimize the sound delivery. This type of powerful magnet is widely used in precise instruments like those in fighter planes.

<p>​Dejun Zeng is the founder and chief designer at Muzen. The creator of China's first commercial tube amplifier, Zeng has spent a lifetime in audio, using his skills and experience to create a new kind of radio.</p>
<p>In the 1980s, he invested heavily to purchase the top Japanese speakers for in-depth research. Disappointed by what was available at the time, he became determined to create a better speaker in China.</p>
<p>In the 1990s, he went to Shenzhen to start a business and designed China’s top audio system.</p>
<p>In the 2000s, he moved away from tube amplifiers for the sake of redesigning retro radios.</p>
<p>In the 2010s, when he was in his sixties, he established the Muzen Audio brand and created a trendy speaker that was very popular with young women and opened up the market for vintage speakers in China.</p>
<p>In the 2020s he said, it’s better to revisit old passions and create a product that combines the best of retro and modern with a wild and robust design.From the 1980s to the 2020s, 4 decades of experience and inspiration produced his latest creation - the Muzen Wild Mini was born. <br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/030/622/033/545b0c19e2f750c80bc83e892de6d6a8_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-2.1.0&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1600250090&amp;auto=format&amp;frame=1&amp;q=92&amp;s=1c8efb8467e990492146f2b34bba4ce6"" src=""""/><br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/030/544/661/cd45005c85a88e04120f17e29305d75b_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-2.1.0&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1599723030&amp;auto=format&amp;frame=1&amp;q=92&amp;s=4d574f9f91a6a509a2aface02137ea6e"" src=""""/><br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/030/454/459/bb53dda4d2acf837c6b8bff7e3008667_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-2.1.0&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1599105351&amp;auto=format&amp;frame=1&amp;q=92&amp;s=eca65c10b4ae2c8d9e516c6fa609c402"" src=""""/><br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/030/712/703/e8c82cbb7fd6b21ef19a46ce66a3ff33_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-2.1.0&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1600854246&amp;auto=format&amp;frame=1&amp;q=92&amp;s=a3d5e738fb520fc43e0380db7549c228"" src=""""/><br/><br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/030/544/684/14352096e74d442627a5cfb7e097e5a4_original.png?ixlib=rb-2.1.0&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1599723137&amp;auto=format&amp;frame=1&amp;lossless=true&amp;s=c72bc5f1573323882eda81f95c792191"" src=""""/><br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/030/622/041/c1f4e50990bf154a1785c28fb04b3698_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-2.1.0&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1600250107&amp;auto=format&amp;frame=1&amp;q=92&amp;s=8d531dea25e89e46c12b3da6541bc513"" src=""""/><br/><br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/030/633/641/2a598ae7cf737a63294a144a17924941_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-2.1.0&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1600309075&amp;auto=format&amp;frame=1&amp;q=92&amp;s=ee0ba49849359cb76ab4cfdb5502d450"" src=""""/><br/><br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/030/633/644/cfbf4e89e26f4799ce1c61574f109a9e_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-2.1.0&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1600309089&amp;auto=format&amp;frame=1&amp;q=92&amp;s=83fb34a131acfeb61a3c7e3b90c9d1b8"" src=""""/><br/><br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1603699604/djugoyorwywzc6ku8bnl.jpg"" src=""""/><br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1603702703/lvhqijkilhodefiniitc.jpg"" src=""""/><br/><br/><br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/030/544/666/51995740e6fca5938ef05be0f82e897e_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-2.1.0&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1599723064&amp;auto=format&amp;frame=1&amp;q=92&amp;s=8ef439d1fbbb724142740803fc11b480"" src=""""/><br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1603850057/pnxu1glsvoddcxo7hudh.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

​Power your music longer. Muzen Wild Mini can provide up to 6 hours of playtime on a single charge. ​
 

 
Small In Size -  Big In Sound 
Muzen Wild Mini uses a large-diameter speaker made from a rare-earth magnet (N40 NdFeB magnet) to optimize the sound delivery. This type of powerful magnet is widely used in precise instruments like those in fighter planes. Muzen Wild Mini can rock a surprisingly bigger and more accurate sound compared to typical speakers of the same size. 

 
 Never Compromise The Sound Quality 
Muzen Wild Mini was designed and tuned by the creator of Muzen, Dejun Zeng, a well-known name in the Chinese audio industry who spent many years reviving vintage radios. Using advanced DSP tech, high-power digital amplifier and full-metal cavity resonance, Wild Mini delivers full spectrum sound and powerful bass at large volumes without losing clarity. 

 
Who We Are
MUZEN, is an audio brand that combines aesthetics and technology. Our team is a group of experienced audio engineers and designers working in the field for nearly 40 years at MUZEN AUDIO.  

 
Why We Created Wild Mini 
Before Wild Mini, Muzen Audio was focused on creating stylish vintage portable speakers. The Wild Mini is a brand new idea and it was inspired by the top quality of military spec equipment. Tough and wild, mini but powerful, and built around rare-earth magnet technology that greatly optimizes sound quality.  
  About Dejun Zeng
​Dejun Zeng is the founder and chief designer at Muzen. The creator of China's first commercial tube amplifier, Zeng has spent a lifetime in audio, using his skills and experience to create a new kind of radio.
In the 1980s, he invested heavily to purchase the top Japanese speakers for in-depth research. Disappointed by what was available at the time, he became determined to create a better speaker in China.
In the 1990s, he went to Shenzhen to start a business and designed China’s top audio system.
In the 2000s, he moved away from tube amplifiers for the sake of redesigning retro radios.
In the 2010s, when he was in his sixties, he established the Muzen Audio brand and created a trendy speaker that was very popular with young women and opened up the market for vintage speakers in China.
In the 2020s he said, it’s better to revisit old passions and create a product that combines the best of retro and modern with a wild and robust design.From the 1980s to the 2020s, 4 decades of experience and inspiration produced his latest creation - the Muzen Wild Mini was born.",37.0,2,"2 Campaigns

<p style=""text-align: center;"">Our mission is to create music gear that improves and changes the way people approach and play music. The crazy idea of making the PLUS Pedal is what brought us together almost 3 years ago. After a lot of hard work, we've managed to bring PLUS Pedal to musicians all over the world, and now it is time to make PLASMA an even greater success!</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">This is the reason we turn to crowdfunding. We wish to make PLASMA available to everyone in terms of soonest delivery and best price point. This means that we need to organize our production in larger batches. Being a small company, this means that <strong>we need your help</strong> to make big things happen. Together we can make PLASMA Pedal a reality in the quickest and most accessible way.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">The funds received in this campaign will be immediately spent on parts orders and finalizing the PLASMA Pedal for manufacturing. Let's get PLASMA on pedalboards around the world ASAP!</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">FEATURES</h2>
<div style=""text-align: center;""> </div>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">The PLASMA PEDAL is a revolutionary approach within the realm of overdrive and distortion, it is a new and previously unexplored method of achieving signal clipping. Instead of using LED circuits, transistors or vacuum tubes to produce overdrive, the PLASMA PEDAL transforms your instrument’s live signal into a series of continuous high-voltage discharges within a xenon-filled tube.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">In essence – you are playing a bolt of electricity, and the electrical discharges produced by your instrument are instantly converted back into an analog audio signal, producing a quick, responsive, and extremely heavy distortion with TONS of unique character!</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Unique Harmonic Saturation</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Electric discharges result in a large amount of non-linear harmonic saturation that causes extremely rich and responsive attacks and brings out screechingly sharp overtones and harmonics. These harmonic artifacts, produced as a byproduct of the high-voltage discharge, are uncommon in traditional signal amplification, and therefore PLASMA Pedal’s distortion is unlike anything you have heard before.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Natural Noise-Gate</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">By maxing out the BLEND knob you can achieve a fully wet signal, produced only by the gas-discharge tube. This means that as soon as you stop playing,  the electric discharge within the gas-filled tube is interrupted,  and the pedal does not produce any output signal at all.  This feature allows you to achieve extreme contrasts between individual notes by eliminating all of the in-between noises created by the instrument's pick-ups or by humming strings.<br/>Thanks to this, PLASMA PEDAL is extremely well suited for playing heavy riffs or sharp staccato solos. Really – there’s nothing like it!</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Crush any Sound</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">PLASMA PEDAL is designed primarily for guitarists, but it is also an awesome distortion tool for all sorts of electronic beats, synths, and live instrument samples.<br/>As you max up the VOLTAGE knob, you can add satisfying amounts of electrical buzz to any sound.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">TEAM</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Gamechanger | Audio was founded by four friends committed to exploring the uncharted territories of music electronics and creating devices that provide real value while stretching the imagination of both musicians and engineers.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Our journey began in November 2015 when we started working on our first product – the PLUS Pedal, which we launched about a year ago at Winter NAMM 2017. Following a widely successful crowdfunding campaign, we were finally able to start manufacturing PLUS Pedals in August 2017, and it’s been nothing but pure joy to read the feedback from our happy customers all over the world.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">The success of PLUS Pedal has been a great inspiration to us, and we’re proud to say that our small team has now doubled in size, and there are many more Game-changing and head-scratching ideas in the making! We invite you to join our journey and we’re certain that together we will be able to leave a permanent mark on the fabric of music technology, and have a ton of fun on the way...<br/> </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""> </h2>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">FAQ</h2>
<h3>How long till the xenon tube dies? Is it replaceable?</h3>
<p>We estimate that the tube should last around 70 000 hours which is 24 years if you play 8 hours every day. We do not know this for sure since we have not tested it for that long. However, we've been testing PLASMA Distortion for many months now and we have not noticed any signs of wear.<br/>Yes, the tube is replaceable in case it gets broken or damaged due to physical impact.</p>
<h3>Is it safe?</h3>
<p>Yes, it is completely safe as long as you use it the way guitar pedals should normally be used. The amount of danger is comparable to operating a photo camera with a flash. :) The full instructions will be provided in the users' manual.</p>
<h3>What about the PLUS Pedal, where can I get a combo pack?</h3>
<p>There is no need to wait for the PLUS Pedal, it is in stock and available from our website and a range of dealers. Check out <a href=""http://gamechangeraudio.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.gamechangeraudio.com</a> to get the PLUS Pedal.</p>
<h3>Will you really ship on time?</h3>
<p>We will do our best, but slight delays are possible since we are using unusual components (transformers, discharge-tubes). What we do know for sure is that it took us 7 months to set up the whole infrastructure, produce, and ship the PLUS Pedal to early backers. This time we already have the infrastructure and supply chain in place, that is why we believe that our deadlines are realistic. :)</p>
<h3>Is it true bypass?</h3>
<p>Yes, it is.</p>
<h3>How to contact you?</h3>
<p>You can post any question in the comments section or send us an email to <a href=""mailto:info@gamechangeraudio.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">info@gamechangeraudio.com</a>, we will get back to you in a Business Day or less.</p>
<h2>Where to try it out?</h2>

OUR STORY 

 
 
LIVE TESTING
It is our belief that the best description of PLASMA Pedal is actually getting to play the pedal! That is why we have created a live testing platform via a Youtube Livestream!






 

 

 

 

 

Go to www.plasmapedal.com to upload your sound sample and take the pedal for a test drive. This is an actual Plasma Pedal prototype set up in our garage and playing 24/7 since  March 10th. We have gone through a lot to make this set up sound realistic, but please bear in mind that this is a state-of the art simulation!
 

 
IDEA
Our mission is to create music gear that improves and changes the way people approach and play music. The crazy idea of making the PLUS Pedal is what brought us together almost 3 years ago. After a lot of hard work, we've managed to bring PLUS Pedal to musicians all over the world, and now it is time to make PLASMA an even greater success!
This is the reason we turn to crowdfunding. We wish to make PLASMA available to everyone in terms of soonest delivery and best price point. This means that we need to organize our production in larger batches. Being a small company, this means that we need your help to make big things happen. Together we can make PLASMA Pedal a reality in the quickest and most accessible way.
The funds received in this campaign will be immediately spent on parts orders and finalizing the PLASMA Pedal for manufacturing. Let's get PLASMA on pedalboards around the world ASAP!

FEATURES
 
The PLASMA PEDAL is a revolutionary approach within the realm of overdrive and distortion, it is a new and previously unexplored method of achieving signal clipping. Instead of using LED circuits, transistors or vacuum tubes to produce overdrive, the PLASMA PEDAL transforms your instrument’s live signal into a series of continuous high-voltage discharges within a xenon-filled tube.
In essence – you are playing a bolt of electricity, and the electrical discharges produced by your instrument are instantly converted back into an analog audio signal, producing a quick, responsive, and extremely heavy distortion with TONS of unique character!
Unique Harmonic Saturation
Electric discharges result in a large amount of non-linear harmonic saturation that causes extremely rich and responsive attacks and brings out screechingly sharp overtones and harmonics. These harmonic artifacts, produced as a byproduct of the high-voltage discharge, are uncommon in traditional signal amplification, and therefore PLASMA Pedal’s distortion is unlike anything you have heard before.
Natural Noise-Gate
By maxing out the BLEND knob you can achieve a fully wet signal, produced only by the gas-discharge tube. This means that as soon as you stop playing,  the electric discharge within the gas-filled tube is interrupted,  and the pedal does not produce any output signal at all.  This feature allows you to achieve extreme contrasts between individual notes by eliminating all of the in-between noises created by the instrument's pick-ups or by humming strings.Thanks to this, PLASMA PEDAL is extremely well suited for playing heavy riffs or sharp staccato solos. Really – there’s nothing like it!
Crush any Sound
PLASMA PEDAL is designed primarily for guitarists, but it is also an awesome distortion tool for all sorts of electronic beats, synths, and live instrument samples.As you max up the VOLTAGE knob, you can add satisfying amounts of electrical buzz to any sound.

SHIPPING AND PAYMENT
We expect to ship the very first Plasma Pedals late August 2018. This will be known after we place the parts orders, but the mentioned deadlines are very realistic.
The Power Supply Unit is not included with the Plasma Pedal, but any reasonably standard pedal board power supply will do well! We do not offer it because we cannot keep stock of all the different power outlets across the globe.
We ship worldwide with UPS or FedEx and offer 2 - 5 Business Day delivery. The payment for your order on Indiegogo includes all taxes in the United States and the European Union. We will ship the Plasma Pedals from Riga, Latvia. If you are outside the US or the EU, you can estimate the customs and tax payments by checking the customs limits with your Customs Office, ask them about electronics imports from the European Union.
Your payment is eligible for full, no-questions-asked refund until the day you receive the Plasma Pedal. After you will receive the Plasma Pedal, there is a 30 day return period, you only need to cover the return shipping fee. The warranty is one year or longer if required by the relevant legislation.
TIMELINE 2018
 

 
TEAM
Gamechanger | Audio was founded by four friends committed to exploring the uncharted territories of music electronics and creating devices that provide real value while stretching the imagination of both musicians and engineers.
Our journey began in November 2015 when we started working on our first product – the PLUS Pedal, which we launched about a year ago at Winter NAMM 2017. Following a widely successful crowdfunding campaign, we were finally able to start manufacturing PLUS Pedals in August 2017, and it’s been nothing but pure joy to read the feedback from our happy customers all over the world.
The success of PLUS Pedal has been a great inspiration to us, and we’re proud to say that our small team has now doubled in size, and there are many more Game-changing and head-scratching ideas in the making! We invite you to join our journey and we’re certain that together we will be able to leave a permanent mark on the fabric of music technology, and have a ton of fun on the way... 
 
FAQ
How long till the xenon tube dies? Is it replaceable?
We estimate that the tube should last around 70 000 hours which is 24 years if you play 8 hours every day. We do not know this for sure since we have not tested it for that long. However, we've been testing PLASMA Distortion for many months now and we have not noticed any signs of wear.Yes, the tube is replaceable in case it gets broken or damaged due to physical impact.
Is it safe?
Yes, it is completely safe as long as you use it the way guitar pedals should normally be used. The amount of danger is comparable to operating a photo camera with a flash. :) The full instructions will be provided in the users' manual.
What about the PLUS Pedal, where can I get a combo pack?
There is no need to wait for the PLUS Pedal, it is in stock and available from our website and a range of dealers. Check out www.gamechangeraudio.com to get the PLUS Pedal.
Will you really ship on time?
We will do our best, but slight delays are possible since we are using unusual components (transformers, discharge-tubes). What we do know for sure is that it took us 7 months to set up the whole infrastructure, produce, and ship the PLUS Pedal to early backers. This time we already have the infrastructure and supply chain in place, that is why we believe that our deadlines are realistic. :)
Is it true bypass?
Yes, it is.
How to contact you?
You can post any question in the comments section or send us an email to info@gamechangeraudio.com, we will get back to you in a Business Day or less.
Where to try it out?
You can try it right here online, we have built a Plasma Robot which accepts your sound samples and plays them in a Youtube livestream. Go to plasmapedal.com to try it out!

<p><b>Telescopic Tweeter Speaker System </b>        </p>
<p>To deliver a more layered sound performance better than a sole full-range speaker, our acoustic engineering team equipped Luna with one more tweeter speaker responsible for high-frequency sound independently. The tweeter is embedded in Luna Eye. The telescopic mechanic allows it to come out of the sphere body to give more space between the tweeter and the full range speaker inside. It allows better diaphragm vibration performance and make the whole Luna sound better.</p>

<p><b>Immersive Stereo  System   </b>    </p>
<p>Luna sound system enables a even more layered and immersive stereo listening experience with multi-speaker pairing technology. With one single speaker you can only enjoy the best sound quality in front of the device. On the other hand, traditional stereo system costs tons of money. But today thanks to wireless pairing tech, we can expand the audio experience into stereo groups you can easily afford. Luna applies MESHNET technology, with which you can add up several Luna together to customize your own stereo system easily. </p>

</div>","Excellent Wireless Listening Experience       
Elevate your music lifestyle by creating a powerful speaker network customized to all listening scenarios, with wonderful sound and powerful connectivity. The centerpiece of Luna’s design, Luna Eye, which includes a tweeter will automatically emerge when it is powered on. This telescopic system benefits the diaphragm vibration by giving more space for the speaker inside. It will be super easy to connect Luna to your phone, tablet or laptop for music streaming from your spotify or pandora account. Powered by MESHNET network technology, the Luna network can support up to 32 units paired together as a stereo system. 











Luna Eye          
Luna Eye is to the essence of this innovative light and audio system. It comprises an independent tweeter speaker, a light guiding component, a dome and a ring ornament. Applies smart electric telescopic system, Luna eye will automatically come out of the body when powered on just like a camera lenses. 






Telescopic Tweeter Speaker System         
To deliver a more layered sound performance better than a sole full-range speaker, our acoustic engineering team equipped Luna with one more tweeter speaker responsible for high-frequency sound independently. The tweeter is embedded in Luna Eye. The telescopic mechanic allows it to come out of the sphere body to give more space between the tweeter and the full range speaker inside. It allows better diaphragm vibration performance and make the whole Luna sound better.






To give you a benchmark of how Luna will sound, here we have a direct comparison between one Luna unit and three other popular speakers on market. In this video we are using the latest acoustic sample of Luna that the R&D team just completed. We are pretty confident that in stereo mode with 2 units of Luna or above, the sound will even be even better.

Intuitive Lighting System          
The Luna Eye’s proprietary lighting system comes preloaded with patterns that will please the eye as much as the Luna’s sound pleases the ear. An intuitive user interface allows you to adjust the hue and saturation of color for lighting that fits any mood and situation.






Color Wheel          
Simply swipe on the color wheel in crazybaby App, you can adjust HUE and saturation of Luna light. It literally includes all colors on earth. We want Luna truly become your customized personal device. Match your golden, silver or space gray Luna with a unique color light to fit your mood, your tone of music, or your home interior design style.









 “It really took me by surprise honestly to have such full beautiful sound that coming out of this small  compact device. And with the brush aluminum surface, it feels so familiar. Like my iPhone.”
Garrett Martin -
Creative Director, Luna User.          


















Immersive Stereo  System       
Luna sound system enables a even more layered and immersive stereo listening experience with multi-speaker pairing technology. With one single speaker you can only enjoy the best sound quality in front of the device. On the other hand, traditional stereo system costs tons of money. But today thanks to wireless pairing tech, we can expand the audio experience into stereo groups you can easily afford. Luna applies MESHNET technology, with which you can add up several Luna together to customize your own stereo system easily. 











The future of wireless music is here          
Luna’s performance is balanced and smooth in all frequency ranges which makes the music both naturally pleasant and distinctly more layered. Its high sensitivity makes the sound more transparent and resonant. Under the same music source, it renders an all-around upgrade of acoustic performance.






Precision engineered for great audio          
Luna is built with the most advanced audio engineer technology, which is a perfect integration of Sound, Light and Appearance. The aircraft grade aluminum skeleton as well as the most robust structure that ensures crystal clear delivery of full range sound. Press the back power button, let the outstanding, distortion-free sound fills the room, feel the difference.






Luna Eye Full Range Speaker          
Luna’s 2-inch full range NdFeB speaker with less distortion, more linear magnetic path. From damper to air-flow design, from harmonic absorption to control of sizing technique, the fact that we never overlook a single detail that consummates Luna’s delightful voice.








Multiroom experience has never been so smooth and easy. No need for bridges or complicated apps. Luna is natively compatible with your home Wi-Fi. Set up multiple speakers in different rooms to expand your music experience into the entire house.          











 Party Mode          
Luna is the perfect fit for your home party. Simple and easy sync up maximum 32 units of Luna to rock every corner of your room. Everyone can stream their own music to share with the crowd.






Only with a simple touch on your Luna, it instantly streams music to any room you want. Powered by MESHNET network technology, the music network can be expanded up to 32 rooms.          





Whatever you listen to with your Spotify or Pandora account, you can easy have it on Luna. Speaker should be designed to keep updated with people’s listening behavior. We work closely with all mainstream music service, and third party platforms. The result is universal compatibility with dozens of service providers. Straight out of the box, Luna is ready to rock off your roof.           






Seamless Integration with Airplay          
Luna fits perfectly with your airplay devices as its Hi-Fi complement. Connect multiple Luna wireless to your Apple TV to get a full immersive audio-visual experience. www.apple.com/tv























































Futuristic Design          
Luna inherited the spirit of our relentless pursuit of great design and futuristic expression from its predecessor, Mars by crazybaby™.  The sphere is the most perfect and harmonious geometric pattern in the world, yet also an insurmountable challenge in the field of industrial design. To give Luna a truly flawless look, we specifically picked aircraft grade aluminum as its material and adopted both three-dimensional stretch-bending technology and a high precision cold forging technique.






Just the right amount of comfortable grip    
Made of aircraft grade aluminum utilizing with three-dimensional stretch-bending technology, Luna has this stunning design like a piece of fine art, from the Uni-body front cover . to the exquisite brim. But these features aren’t just for shown: its sophisticated crafted anodized surface feels as good as it looks.






High precision cold forging technology          
Luna’s surface is made with cutting-edge CNC cold forging technology. It requires extremely high precision and is far more complex compared to traditional die-cast molding techniques, however, we took the risk of increased costs, just to ensure Luna has a 100% flawless look.

<p><b>Your smartphone is a remote control:</b> Mighty doesn’t have a screen like other devices, so we built software that allows you to control Mighty using your smartphone as a Bluetooth remote control. Simply launch the Mighty mobile app, login to your Premium account, and make your playlists available for offline play using the familiar 'Available Offline' button. Instead of downloading the selected playlists to your phone, the songs are stored directly on Mighty. Songs are transferred with WiFi, so the sync process is super quick. It only takes a few minutes to sync hundreds of songs to Mighty.</p>
<p>Once the sync is complete, put your phone down and take Mighty with you on-the-go. You won’t need your phone again until you want to change your playlist selections.</p>
<p><b>Controlled with physical buttons:</b> Playing music on Mighty is easy and intuitive. To start playing a song, simply press the play button and Mighty will automatically launch the first song in your first synced playlist. Use the song forward/back buttons to scroll through all of the songs in that playlist. </p>
<p>If you want to navigate to a different playlist, press the playlist selector button to scroll through all synced playlists. Each time you hit the playlist selector button, Mighty will dictate the name of the playlist to you through your headphones. You even have the ability to record playlist names yourself, so you’ll always know what playlist you’re selecting. (Note: this is very useful if you’re like us and give your playlists names like “Pu’s Pump Up Mix”).</p>
<p><b>Battery life:</b> Mighty will be capable of up to 5 hours of continuous music playback when fully charged. Ultimately, the goal is to achieve 10+ hours of playback without increasing the size of the device. Even after the first batch of Mighty is shipped, we can continue to improve battery life remotely by updating our software. No new hardware will be required. Optimizing battery life is the #1 priority for our development team.</p>

<p><b>We’ve spent a lot of time studying about the market we are trying to serve, and we think it shows with our current solution.</b> Ergonomics and usability were the most important aspects of the design, letting you keep your eyes on the scenery and not on a screen. Ever try to use that touchscreen with gloves on? Mighty doesn’t have this problem, the tactile buttons fall easily underneath your fingertips without looking. We also tried to keep Mighty as small and light as possible so that it can clip it to any article of clothing. Last but certainly not least, Mighty is tough. It’s sweat and drop resistant, just in case, because we’ve seen all those cracked smartphone screens.</p>
<p><b>We paid particular attention to people trying to use their phones while in motion.</b> Switching a song while running can be an awkward experience - the fumbling and tripping that some of us encounter is never fun and occasionally dangerous. So we made the experience of switching songs and playlists very intuitive. As for the headphones, Mighty has a headphone jack for your favorite wired headphones. Additionally, you can pair Mighty with wireless Bluetooth headphones, giving you full cordless freedom.</p>

<b>Mighty was built by a passionate team with expertise in active living, tech, and music.</b> We have decades of experience developing hardware, creating brands, establishing partnerships and launching businesses.

<p><b>Mighty was born from our personal frustrations with exercising with our smartphones.</b> Every member of our team has cracked their phone screen while exercising. When we spoke to family and friends, we realized that this is a major pain point for a lot of people.</p>
<p>To take it a step further, we visited popular running trails in Los Angeles to ask runners why they run with their phone. Some people like staying connected at all times, but the majority only bring their phone so they can stream music. And many of them, at some point, had tossed their iPod Shuffles into a drawer, never to be used again. No one likes dealing with cords and computers and, honestly, who still downloads music?!? We truly wondered why this type of product didn’t already exist. So we decided that if nobody else was going to do it, we were going to give it a shot.</p>

Mighty was built by a passionate team with expertise in active living, tech, and music. We have decades of experience developing hardware, creating brands, establishing partnerships and launching businesses. Our team who has been through this before and we’re positive that we can successfully take Mighty from idea to final product.
 

Mighty was born from our personal frustrations with exercising with our smartphones. Every member of our team has cracked their phone screen while exercising. When we spoke to family and friends, we realized that this is a major pain point for a lot of people.
To take it a step further, we visited popular running trails in Los Angeles to ask runners why they run with their phone. Some people like staying connected at all times, but the majority only bring their phone so they can stream music. And many of them, at some point, had tossed their iPod Shuffles into a drawer, never to be used again. No one likes dealing with cords and computers and, honestly, who still downloads music?!? We truly wondered why this type of product didn’t already exist. So we decided that if nobody else was going to do it, we were going to give it a shot.

<p style=""display: inline !important;""><b>Vero Full Range Cable </b></p>
<p></p>
<p>The Vero Full Range Cable utilizes MIT Cables patented Multipole™ Technology, which is a parallel and passive network that helps maintain the quality of the signal as it passes from source to headphones. The Vero Full Range Cable has 12 Poles of Articulation strategically placed across the full audible spectrum (20hz-20khz) and is designed to work with specific headphones (i.e., Audeze LCD Series, Mr. Speaker Alpha Series, etc.).    MSRP: $499</p>

<p>""MIT NAILED it with the VERO Reference. It's such a magnificent pairing with my beloved Audeze LCD-2s that I forget about my inner-geek and focus on the music! Tip of the hat... It's now one of my top reference headphone cables."" </p>

<p><b>Vero Reference Cable </b></p>
<p>The Vero Reference Cable can be terminated to your headphones like the Vero Full Range Cable. The Vero Reference Cable houses the same technology that the Vero Full Range Cable has, and includes 21 Poles of Articulation. The difference in what you hear is based on the larger number of Articulation Poles. MIT’s Poles of Articulation synergistically work together to transport the audio signal with a more even, or flatter response than just a single cable. With the additional 9-Articulation Poles, the bass is more controlled, the mid-range is smoother with more extended highs. The noise floor has been dramatically dropped once again.  MSRP: $899</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>Vero Standard Universal Dongle </b></p>
<p>The Vero Standard Universal Dongle also utilizes MIT Cables patented Multipole™ Technology, and like the Vero Full Range Cable, has 12 Poles of Articulation. All Vero Dongles can be used with any stock headphone cable or fixed cable headphone and are not limited to specific manufacturers, models or types. The Standard  Universal Dongle  was developed as a way to integrate the same Multipole™ Technology as the Vero Full Range Cable, but with headphones that have non-detachable cables and to better enhance other aftermarket cables. The Vero Standard Universal Dongle can perform at about 70%-80% of the Vero Full Range Cable depending on the combination of headphones and cables used.  MSRP: $299</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>Vero Bass Dongle</b></p>
<p>The Vero Bass Dongle also utilizes Multipole™ Technology by containing the 10 Poles of Articulation within the last 3 lower octaves, producing a much fuller and natural sounding bass and enhancing the lower frequency articulation.. The Vero Bass Dongle is a great companian to the Vero Full Range Cable and Vero Standard Universal Dongle, and really compliments the Vero Reference Cable as well as other manufacturer cables. MSRP $350</p>

<p><b>Vero Adapter Dongle </b></p>
<p>The Vero “Adapter” Dongle looks just like the other Vero Dongles, but will instead house one of the technologies that has been used in MIT’s Reference Category of Products for years. This technology reduces all forms of extraneous noise generated by such things as your digitizer, amplifier or passive elements found within your audio or headphone systems. The MIT Technology that will be included within the Vero “Adapter” Dongle will reduce the noise floor and increase the low level detail. Listeners often refer to this as creating a “blacker” background. With the noise removed, timbres and textures are more accurately heard, while sound staging and images within the sound stage are also enhanced. The term ‘Holographic’ is often used to describe what the listener hears.

<h2><span>Why We Need...YOU!</span></h2>
<p>When we first started this project, it was clear that we had a winning product for any headphone, providing an experience that headphone users would not only appreciate, but would be like no other. Whether you're a music lover, recording engineer, DJ or gamer, Vero will take you to a whole other level. We mean it when we say, ""you really don't know how great your headphones are, until you pair them with Vero"". </p>
<p>We are ready to turn the Vero Headphone Cable into a reality, and in order to do that, it's important that we determine the needs of our backers. You will help us provide research into the most wanted configurations. We are very familiar with the more popular brands of headphones and how Vero will accommodate specific connections, but we would also like to know whether our Vero Dongle, another prototype that we have designed, is a potential player in our Vero line. Your input and support will not only help us to bring the Vero Headphone Cabling System to headphone users everywhere, but it will also determine how we finish this product. We need your input! </p>

<h2>FAQs </h2>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>Sonically speaking, what is the
difference between the Vero ""Standard"" Dongle, the Vero
""Bass"" Dongle, and the Vero Full Range Cable?</b></p>
<p><b>A: </b> All of the Vero products utilize MIT Cables patented Multipole™ Technology, which is a parallel
and passive network that helps maintain the quality of signal as it passes from
source to headphones.</p>
<p>Both the “Vero Full Range Cable” and “Vero Universal Dongle” have 12 Poles of Articulation strategically placed across
the full audible spectrum (20hz-20khz). The “Vero Universal Dongle” was
developed as a way to integrate Multipole™  Technology with headphones that have non
detachable cables and to enhance other aftermarket cables. We have estimated
that the “Standard Universal Dongle” can perform at about 70%-80% of the “Vero Full
Range Cable” depending on the combination of headphones and cables used. </p>
<p>The “Vero Bass Dongle” also utilizes
Multipole™  Technology by containing the 10 Poles of Articulation within the last
3 lower octaves, producing a much fuller and natural sounding bass. </p>
<p><b>Is combining the various
dongles with the Full Range Cable advised? Will it have a
noticeable benefit, or will it detract from or otherwise distort the sound
I hear?</b></p>
<p><b>A:</b> Yes, the “Bass Dongle” was
developed to work in line with either the “Full Range Cable” or “Standard Universal Dongle”. Combining the “Standard Dongle” with the “Bass Dongle” can yield an
estimated 70%-80% performance when compared to the “Full Range Cable” and “Bass
Dongle”.</p>
<p><b>What about chaining multiple
dongles together? (Say, two Standard dongles, or two Bass
Dongles, or two of each kind of Dongle (4 or more in a row)?</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>A:</b> Yes, the “Bass Dongle” was
developed to work in line with either the “Full Range Cable” or the “Standard Dongle”. Combining the “Standard Dongle” with  the “Bass Dongle” can yield an
estimated 70%-80% performance when compared to the “Full Range Cable” and “Bass Dongle”. Although we do not recommend “chaining” multiple “like” cables/dongles
for SQ reasons, you are more than welcomed to try it out. We at MIT cannot
guarantee an increase or decrease in performance in that case. </p>
<p><b>Will combining the Standard Dongle
with the Bass Dongle improve the quality of sound from my fixed-cable
headphones?</b></p>
<p><b>A:</b> Yes, it will. Combining  the “Vero Full Range Dongle” with the “Bass Dongle” and your factory or aftermarket headphone
cables, will give you an estimated 70%-80% performance compared to a “Vero Full Range Cable” and “Bass Dongle”. The ideal combination for performance will be a
“Vero Full Range Cable” and “Vero Bass Dongle”.</p>
<p><b>Technically speaking, how does the
impact of the Standard Dongle and the Bass Dongle compare to the articulation
poles found in the Full Range Cable?</b></p>
<p><b>A: </b>The “Full Range Cable” and “Standard Universal Dongle” have identical networks with Poles of
Articulation spread across the audible audio spectrum. The difference between
the two is the “Full Range Cable” is designed to work with specific headphones
(i.e. Audeze LCD series, Mr. Speakers Alpha series, etc.), whereas the “Standard Universal Dongle” is designed to work with any headphone as long as the connectors
are specified correctly. We have estimated that the “Standard Dongle” can
perform at 70%-80% of the ""Vero Full Range Cable”.</p>
<p>The “Vero Bass Dongle” was designed solely
for the purpose of enhancing the bass region. The Poles of Articulation in the
“Bass Dongle” network are placed on “bass” frequencies providing the listener
with tight and natural bass. </p>
<p><b>What is the difference betweent the Vero Reference Cable and the Vero Full Range Cable? </b></p>
<p><b>A:</b> The Vero Reference Cable has almost double the number of MIT's patented Multipole Technology, with 21 'Poles of Articulation' compared with the 12 Poles of Articulation that is included in the Vero Full Range Cable. With the additional 9-Articulation Poles, the bass is more controlled, the mid-range is smoother with more extended highs and the noise floor is lowered even more dramitically. </p>
<p><b>Now that you have added the Vero Reference Cable, is the Bass Dongle obsolete?</b> </p>
<p><b>A: </b>Not at all. The Vero Bass Dongle is an exceptional addition to all of the Vero Line of Cables and even works when paired with the Vero Standard Universal Dongle. </p>
<p><b>Why is the Vero Adapter called a ""Dongle"" and what is the difference between it and other ""adapters""? What does it look like? </b></p>
<p><b>A: </b> The reason why we call our Vero ""adapter"" a ""dongle"" is because it IS a ""Dongle"" that can work like an adapter. Because MIT is known for their patented technologies, we decided that any ""adapter"" we designed would also provide additional purposes, and would work to compliment the Vero Headphone Cabling ""System"", by interacting with each other to bring out the best in the music that you listen to, as well as the headphones that you use. </p>
<p><b>When will I receive my Vero Backer Survey and what will be on it? </b></p>
<p><b>A: </b>The Vero Backer Survey will be sent shortly after the Vero Campaign has ended on May 22nd. The Survey will be sent in small batches so that we can better accommodate backers questions and changes without being overwhelmed. We want to provide the best customer service possible, and sometimes that is easier to do in smaller groups than in larger ones! We promise to get the surveys out weekly, and do our best to facilitate our backers completed orders as quickly as possible. What you will find on the survey will be questions confirming your order, shipping address and contact information as well as the configuration choices for your cables. </p>
</div></div>","THANK YOU! 
We couldn't be more thrilled! Everyone here at MIT appreciates all of our backers support and those that helped spread the word on our campaign! 
Please see the latest update posted for more information on the campaign as we move into Indiegogo's InDemand Program. 
Again, thank you so much! 


Thank you to all of our backers and supporters! Just in case you missed it, be sure to read the Headphone.Guru review on the Vero Cable System, including the Vero Reference Cable, the Full Range and the Bass Dongle! 







Why do I need Vero? 
You've already invested in a great pair of headphones and music source. Why not get the best sound out of them? Vero is for music lovers, for those who get lost in the different nuances of sound that makes you a music lover in the first place.
With Vero you will hear pieces of the music you never knew were there, bringing the performance right in front of you and making it more lifelike.


Some of our backers came by our booth at the SoCal CanJam2015...here's what they had to say about Vero!




The Vero Headphone Cabling System





Vero Full Range Cable 

The Vero Full Range Cable utilizes MIT Cables patented Multipole™ Technology, which is a parallel and passive network that helps maintain the quality of the signal as it passes from source to headphones. The Vero Full Range Cable has 12 Poles of Articulation strategically placed across the full audible spectrum (20hz-20khz) and is designed to work with specific headphones (i.e., Audeze LCD Series, Mr. Speaker Alpha Series, etc.).    MSRP: $499


""MIT NAILED it with the VERO Reference. It's such a magnificent pairing with my beloved Audeze LCD-2s that I forget about my inner-geek and focus on the music! Tip of the hat... It's now one of my top reference headphone cables."" 
                                                                                       ~ Mike Mercer, OccupyHifi.org
Vero Reference Cable 
The Vero Reference Cable can be terminated to your headphones like the Vero Full Range Cable. The Vero Reference Cable houses the same technology that the Vero Full Range Cable has, and includes 21 Poles of Articulation. The difference in what you hear is based on the larger number of Articulation Poles. MIT’s Poles of Articulation synergistically work together to transport the audio signal with a more even, or flatter response than just a single cable. With the additional 9-Articulation Poles, the bass is more controlled, the mid-range is smoother with more extended highs. The noise floor has been dramatically dropped once again.  MSRP: $899


Vero Standard Universal Dongle 
The Vero Standard Universal Dongle also utilizes MIT Cables patented Multipole™ Technology, and like the Vero Full Range Cable, has 12 Poles of Articulation. All Vero Dongles can be used with any stock headphone cable or fixed cable headphone and are not limited to specific manufacturers, models or types. The Standard  Universal Dongle  was developed as a way to integrate the same Multipole™ Technology as the Vero Full Range Cable, but with headphones that have non-detachable cables and to better enhance other aftermarket cables. The Vero Standard Universal Dongle can perform at about 70%-80% of the Vero Full Range Cable depending on the combination of headphones and cables used.  MSRP: $299


Vero Bass Dongle
The Vero Bass Dongle also utilizes Multipole™ Technology by containing the 10 Poles of Articulation within the last 3 lower octaves, producing a much fuller and natural sounding bass and enhancing the lower frequency articulation.. The Vero Bass Dongle is a great companian to the Vero Full Range Cable and Vero Standard Universal Dongle, and really compliments the Vero Reference Cable as well as other manufacturer cables. MSRP $350



Vero Adapter Dongle 
The Vero “Adapter” Dongle looks just like the other Vero Dongles, but will instead house one of the technologies that has been used in MIT’s Reference Category of Products for years. This technology reduces all forms of extraneous noise generated by such things as your digitizer, amplifier or passive elements found within your audio or headphone systems. The MIT Technology that will be included within the Vero “Adapter” Dongle will reduce the noise floor and increase the low level detail. Listeners often refer to this as creating a “blacker” background. With the noise removed, timbres and textures are more accurately heard, while sound staging and images within the sound stage are also enhanced. The term ‘Holographic’ is often used to describe what the listener hears. MSRP $299 

What is Multipole™ Technology?

MIT Cables’ core audio cable technology is our exclusive Poles of Articulation, named after the fact that every audio cable has a single point where it is most efficient at storing and transporting energy. At this point in the audio frequency spectrum, the cable will articulate best, and represents the cables’ particular Articulation Pole.




 If you could use three different cables at the same  time... and each had an Articulation Pole to connect two audio components, you would have an interface with three Articulation Poles; one for the highs, one for the mids, and one for the lows. Together, they would work to transport the audio signal from component to component with more articulation.

Shipping Costs

For international shipping:  All International backers will be contacted personally and will be provided their shipping costs. Due to the fact that we have many countries participating in our campaign, and we require specific protocol (insurance and/or signature required shipping), we feel it would be unfair to provide one rate for all international shipments based on the fact that they vary greatly between countries. 
For all U.S. shipments, please add $11 for shipping. This includes combined shipments (multiple perks).

FAQs 


Sonically speaking, what is the
difference between the Vero ""Standard"" Dongle, the Vero
""Bass"" Dongle, and the Vero Full Range Cable?
A:  All of the Vero products utilize MIT Cables patented Multipole™ Technology, which is a parallel
and passive network that helps maintain the quality of signal as it passes from
source to headphones.
Both the “Vero Full Range Cable” and “Vero Universal Dongle” have 12 Poles of Articulation strategically placed across
the full audible spectrum (20hz-20khz). The “Vero Universal Dongle” was
developed as a way to integrate Multipole™  Technology with headphones that have non
detachable cables and to enhance other aftermarket cables. We have estimated
that the “Standard Universal Dongle” can perform at about 70%-80% of the “Vero Full
Range Cable” depending on the combination of headphones and cables used. 
The “Vero Bass Dongle” also utilizes
Multipole™  Technology by containing the 10 Poles of Articulation within the last
3 lower octaves, producing a much fuller and natural sounding bass. 
Is combining the various
dongles with the Full Range Cable advised? Will it have a
noticeable benefit, or will it detract from or otherwise distort the sound
I hear?
A: Yes, the “Bass Dongle” was
developed to work in line with either the “Full Range Cable” or “Standard Universal Dongle”. Combining the “Standard Dongle” with the “Bass Dongle” can yield an
estimated 70%-80% performance when compared to the “Full Range Cable” and “Bass
Dongle”.
What about chaining multiple
dongles together? (Say, two Standard dongles, or two Bass
Dongles, or two of each kind of Dongle (4 or more in a row)?


A: Yes, the “Bass Dongle” was
developed to work in line with either the “Full Range Cable” or the “Standard Dongle”. Combining the “Standard Dongle” with  the “Bass Dongle” can yield an
estimated 70%-80% performance when compared to the “Full Range Cable” and “Bass Dongle”. Although we do not recommend “chaining” multiple “like” cables/dongles
for SQ reasons, you are more than welcomed to try it out. We at MIT cannot
guarantee an increase or decrease in performance in that case. 
Will combining the Standard Dongle
with the Bass Dongle improve the quality of sound from my fixed-cable
headphones?
A: Yes, it will. Combining  the “Vero Full Range Dongle” with the “Bass Dongle” and your factory or aftermarket headphone
cables, will give you an estimated 70%-80% performance compared to a “Vero Full Range Cable” and “Bass Dongle”. The ideal combination for performance will be a
“Vero Full Range Cable” and “Vero Bass Dongle”.

The “Vero Bass Dongle” was designed solely
for the purpose of enhancing the bass region. The Poles of Articulation in the
“Bass Dongle” network are placed on “bass” frequencies providing the listener
with tight and natural bass. 
What is the difference betweent the Vero Reference Cable and the Vero Full Range Cable?

With the additional 9-Articulation Poles, the bass is more controlled, the mid-range is smoother with more extended highs and the noise floor is lowered even more dramitically. 
Now that you have added the Vero Reference Cable, is the Bass Dongle obsolete? 
A: Not at all. The Vero Bass Dongle is an exceptional addition to all of the Vero Line of Cables and even works when paired with the Vero Standard Universal Dongle. 
Why is the Vero Adapter called a ""Dongle"" and what is the difference between it and other ""adapters""? What does it look like? 
A:  The reason why we call our Vero ""adapter"" a ""dongle"" is because it IS a ""Dongle"" that can work like an adapter.

They described their idea of the perfect headphones, and we created them.   From the sound quality to the fit and interface, we made sure broski Lety delivered on every front to provide excellent audio quality, exceptional comfort, and a seamless experience. The best headphones should help you slip into undisrupted, uninterrupted, optimal performance and flow - broski Lety does exactly that. We worked with leading experts in headphone design and sound science to meticulously craft the world’s best pair of premium headphones at an affordable price.

Headphones often crackle and distort at high volumes and fail to deliver quality and fidelity. With broski Lety, there is no compromise on sound quality regardless of your volume preferences.The broski Lety boasts incredible crystal-clear highs and features a deep bass resonance and mid-range boost - so you can listen to all the details and feel the music as you zone in.Because human ears are more sensitive to mid-range frequencies, we added an extra power boost to the low midrange frequencies therefore extra clarity is achieved in the high range frequencies. By doing this, we created an enhanced flat response, which gives you an unbelievably phenomenal immersive audio experience. This is HiFi engineering at its finest.The impressive frequency response, unmatched sensitivity, and unique mid-range boost makes broski Lety one of the best sounding and most powerful noise-cancelling headphones on the market. Dive deeper into your workout, work, or whatever you want to focus on with Active Noise Cancellation. The broski Lety uses cutting edge active noise-cancelling technology to monitor and measure exterior noise, then cancel it with an opposing frequency. The result is powerful silence that lets you zone in on your task and get work done.  We designed broski Lety to be ultra-light and comfortable all day long. From the ear cups to the headband to the material used - we ensured every aspect was optimized for long-lasting comfort.The broski Lety’s ear cushions are made of soft vegan leather that gently cups your ears. They’re so comfortable, you’ll forget you’re wearing headphones. We also added field-tested Dual Axis Cups engineered to reduce head pressure and made the headphones adjustable to ensure optimal placement for extended use. Lastly, we used a durable ultralight material to make the broski Lety exceptionally lightweight without compromising strength --- making them comfortable and practical for workouts, travel, long calls, and all facets of life. Don’t worry about sweat, the broski Lety is 100% sweat-proof and stainproof. No more broken headphones, lost connections, or smelly sweat-stained ear cups and headbands - focus on your workout and let the music bring your performance to new heights. The broski Lety uses a long-lasting battery that provides 20+ hours of playtime. If you want to push it even longer, you can switch it to passive mode by connecting the 3.5mm audio cable and disabling the Bluetooth®  connection.Plus, it only takes 3 hours to charge broski Lety from 0% to 100%. broski Lety features intuitively-placed controls to give you a seamless listening experience.

The latest advancement in wireless headphones doesn’t just sound better and last longer than other earbuds, it was designed by industry-leading ergonomic specialists to keep you free and comfortable no matter what.Technology moves fast, but your life moves faster. Kharbon headphones were designed to deliver crystal-clear sound and a perfect in-ear fit regardless of what life throws at you. Whether you’re hustling through a workout, stuck in the rain, diving into the pool, or biking to work, Kharbon won’t skip a beat — because neither can you.Complete waterproofing and dustproofing with IP67 technology seals Kharbon from the elements and keeps your music pumping, rain or shine. And harsh weather is not all Kharbon can withstand. Take your headphones in the pool, the shower, the sauna and more without worry.There are a lot of waterproof headphones out there, but none are like Kharbon. The best waterproofing doesn’t mean anything if the earbuds slip and fall out (as most do) when a little moisture is applied. Kharbon was designed specifically to hold tight and deliver the exact same level of comfort above and below the surface.Turbulent pool waters and high-pressured showers can alter the sound quality of lesser headphones, but Kharbon’s speakers were designed with water dynamics in mind. Move seamlessly from the pool to the sauna to the shower with no change in sound quality. Whether you’re running a marathon or enduring a marathon study session at the library, Kharbon won’t quit. A remarkable continuous 8-hour battery life fits into each tiny headphone to bring all-day audio wherever you need it. Kharbon was designed for all-day use - play your music all day, without interruption.Need to go longer than 8 hours? Kharbon’s lightning-fast charger provides 3 hours of power with just a 15-minute charge. Even if the juice runs low, you’ll never be without your tunes for long.Our award-winning designers and R&D team designed Kharbon to have the best battery life on the market - comparable in capacity to other, much more expensive headphones on the market.Kharbon’s carrying case doubles as its charger, and it also functions as a versatile power bank for all of your devices. With just one charge, you’ll be able to keep your headphones, smartphone, and tablet running for days.The 2000 mAh power bank was designed to protect as well as to power. Its sleek stainless design utilizes the strength of dual arches to diffuse shock and keep your headphones safe from drops, falls, bangs and more.Most power banks hardly fit into a pocket or purse and add an uncomfortable amount of weight to your load. Kharbon’s carrying case is less than half the size of most power banks and weighs no more than the average phone.Kharbon’s custom nano speakers were no accident. Hundreds of prototypes were developed before the perfect speaker was finally born.Kharbon delivers the promise of perfect, unaltered sound quality no matter what life has in store. The crisp highs, booming bass, and crystal-clear vocals will bring you as close as possible to the sensation of hearing your favorite music live.Kharbon uses nanotechnology to deliver the most cutting-edge audio listening experience that audio technology has to offer.With graphene technology, Kharbon uses a material 200 times stronger than steel and 1000 times lighter than paper to provide unparalleled sound and fidelity.With our proprietary in-ear ergonomic design, cancel out external sounds, other voices, and ambient noise when you’re listening to music or on a call.True wireless technology and Bluetooth 5.0 make Kharbon the leading headphones in their class for wireless connectivity. The earbuds detect your device from up to 30 feet away and pair instantly. Just put them in and press play.Keep your phone or tablet safe in your locker at the gym or in your bag at the airport while you access all your music wirelessly from your Kharbon earbuds. You’ll never need to worry about dropped connections or lapses in sound quality thanks to leading Bluetooth 5.0 technology.Kharbon sets you free - roam around the house, play your hardest on the field, even take a dip - Kharbon never stops you from doing your thing.We’ve tested our custom LDS antenna thousands of hours in hundreds of different scenarios to increase bandwidth and signal reception while reducing interference and noise. Experience a TRUE wireless experience with Kharbon.After thousands of hours of research and testing, we utilize the power of Bluetooth 5.0 to remove virtually all sound lag between your device and our buds. Ditch those wires and never miss a beat and experience videos exactly the way they were meant to be.With Kharbon’s voice command system, you can control your music, surf the web, access your messages and much more using just your voice. Kharbon is equipped with an ultra-sensitive microphone that picks up your voice and your voice only. Access Siri or Google Assistant with a subtle command and turn your headphones into your virtual command center.Kharbon’s intuitive touch-control system is an industry first. Forget buttons. These controls are based on your movements. Single and double taps on the left and right earbuds allow you to control your music, answer calls, access your virtual assistant and more.No wireless headphones feel as weightless and comfortable as Kharbon. You’ll barely even notice they’re in. Enjoy the Hi-Fi stereo sound of professional studio headphones without the clunkiness and tangled wires.Our ergonomic engineers worked through dozens of prototypes before landing on the perfect-fit design that can only be found with Kharbon. The combination of precise points of curvature, varying levels of grip, and adjustable buds allows Kharbon to settle into a comfortable, organic fit in any ear. Say goodbye to itching, ear pain, and slippage.One of the biggest downsides to wireless earbuds is that they can fall out and be easily lost. Kharbon’s perfect-fit design makes this all but impossible. Your earbuds will stay secure and immobile whether you’re jumping rope or riding Motocross.Kharbon has a magnetic lock security system for its earbuds that is weatherproof and durable. Fabrics tear, plastics crack, and zippers break, but the power of a magnet will never diminish. With the sturdy magnetic system, your earbuds will be protected from dust, shock, and the elements as they are secured inside the carrying case. Nothing but your touch will release them.The power bank carrying case also features an innovative one-click security system that tells you when your earbuds are safely stored away. When you feel the click, you know your headphones are securely locked in place and charging. To release them, just push to click again and the lock will release.Our magnetic secure-fit technology guarantees your earbuds never get lost or fall out of place. This design optimizes battery capacity and compactness by removing the need for unnecessary buttons or mechanics.Kharbon earbuds pair with every type of device and they do so automatically. Apple, Android, Windows and more, you’ll be able to access all of your music without so much as a click when you remove the earbuds from their dock and put them in.Stay safe on the road and keep your focus at the gym. You won’t need to stop what you’re doing to fish out your device just to access your music. Auto-pairing integrates your favorite music into your life with no hassle.  Our team has been hard at work for more than a year crafting and planning the Kharbon. We're excited to show the world the next evolution of audio technology.Unlike other crowdfunding campaigns, we've already spent months developing a manufacturing-ready model and only need funding for the initial batch order. Purchase yours today and you won’t need to wait long to get the Kharbon in your hands.",86.0,0,"1 Campaign

</div></div>","We believe that the freedom of a premium wireless audio experience should be enjoyable and affordable!
We started our journey over a year ago because of our love for running and passion for music. Running can give you a feeling of ultimate freedom. We love to run on our favourite powersongs, but the fact that our earphones got tangled and limited our movements drove us crazy. We wanted wireless earphones, soon to discover that a set of premium wireless earphones were incredible expensive and simply overpriced.
 


 


We went on a mission to develop our own premium wireless earphones. By focussing on the essentials our earphones are almost half the price of other top name wireless earphone brands.  


 
UPDATE: AT YOUR DOORSTEP WITHIN 2 TO 3 WEEKS!









 

 
 

 




We at WING™ believe that success can only be secured if you give back for what you take. We strive for a future in which every single person can enjoy the world freely and happily! We’ve teamed up with the international NGO Save the Children  and are proud to announce that 7% of our future earnings will be used on projects with them. Improving the lives of as many children possible, all around the world.

We both are fanatic scuba divers and truly love being in and around the ocean. After seeing first-hand how our plastics are destroying the world’s oceans  we decided that we wanted to address this pollution in a positive way. Therefore our packages are made out 100% recyclable cardboard. No Plastics, Period! 





Have your phone close by no matter which work out you are crushing! The WING™ LED Sportarmband makes sure that you can go for a midnight run in a safe way. The batttery lasts an amazing 8 hours and you can simply recharge your sportband with the WING™ Micro USB cable. The armbands come in two sizes 4.7"" inch (iPhone 6 or smaller) or 5.5"" inch (iPhone 6S + or larger).

Unlike many headphones with physical buttons, you don’t need to press the buttons which can end up pushing the headphones into your ear.  The upgraded version of the Bluetooth means various improvements in MEZONE, including longer playtime, better audio quality, greater range, stronger connection and stereo phone calls in both ears.What makes the MEZONE even better at waterproofing than other IPX7rating earphones is its reinforced waterproofing design. Not only is the MEZONE structured to be watertight and dustproof, its internal components are also covered in the nanocoating which makes water flow right through without coming into contact. This translates to a protection from accidental submersion in 1 meter (3.3 feet) of water for up to 30 minutes. You can simply rinse your MEZONE off after a particularly hard workout. We have a 16-year history of innovation and a persistent pursuit for perfection in audio products coded into our company’s culture and DNA. We have cooperated with world’s leading brands including Philips, JBL, Beats and Huawei in designing and production of a wide range of high fidelity products, including microphones, headphones, telephone accessories for personal, professional, business and military applications.  WE ARE IN CES2019",46.0,4,"1 Campaign

Plus you can listen and charge at the same time. We are strong believers that this simplifies the wireless experience and is a crucial key component for the adaptation of wireless earphones. You don't want a pair of earphones that go useless when they run out of battery. Imagine a phone with no ""listen and charge"" functionality?
 The key differentiator in PUGZ earphones UX is our patented self guiding magnetic connector we call: ""The Squircle"". For the best electrical conductivity and styling, we chose this in 18 K Gold.  The Squircle enables you to listen and charge at the same time. This is something the industry had forgot, but we know we can fix.

Sealed provides you with a passive noise cancellation that isolates all surrounding noise and lets you focus on your music experience.

<h2>The Grid</h2>
<p>After three years of continuous development, the Grid is finally ready for action. Throughout the years we developed a number of different prototypes, iterating on the design until we found the perfect solution. We believe that Grid brings a new perspective to creative controllers.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1542297876/dkujyjcbopcvb5ugv3h0.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>Unique X-Y mapping.</h3>
<p>Grid features a unique X-Y mapping, with absolute and relative modes. Your control surface can be easily reconfigured at any time, even while playing live. Each position and even rotation of the modules can indicate a new mapping.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://intech.studio/igg_res/new_xy_igg.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<h3><strong>The Perfect Harmony.</strong></h3>
<p>The control surface creates a seamless tactile user interface. The buttons and potentiometers are evenly spaced in a 1.05"" * 1.05"" (2.7 cm * 2.7 cm) array. This makes the Grid easy to play while also keeping it very portable.  We believe that Grid represents the perfect balance between modularity, usability and component density.</p>
<p>As your needs can change, Grid was designed to pick up your pace. You can easily down and upscale your control surface. Playing together with friends makes the Grid even more exciting.</p>

<h3>Premium build quality.</h3>
<p>All of the user interface components are carefully selected for superior electrical performance and mechanical reliability. We use the USB Type-C connector because it offers better power capability,  convenient reversibility and guaranteed 10,000 mating cycles.</p>
<p>Grid modules interconnect through a custom designed magnetic interface. The spring loaded connectors are designed for maximum reliability. The gold plating on the connectors allows them to be resistant to corrosion.</p>
<p>The new conductive plastic technology pontentiometers and linear faders in the <i>PO16 </i>and <i>PBF4 </i>modules are rated for 100,000 cycles, while the Omron buttons in the <i>BO16 </i>and <i>PBF4</i> modules are rated for 3,000,000 cycles.</p>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The Grid already works. Now our number one priority is to start the tooling process as soon as possible. Once we are happy with the enclosure, we can focus on the PCB Assembly and testing. Finalizing the firmware and the software components is the last piece of the puzzle.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1542102642/oag4ehikhw4zatsehbkq.png"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div><p>Launching the first three modules is just the beginning of the journey. We will use our tools and manufacturing chain to create new modules. Most of the firmware and the hardware designs can also be reused, further reducing the development time, helping us to release new controllers as frequently as possible. Every new Grid module will work flawlessly with modules released in the past.</p></div><h2>Team</h2><p>Music, electronics and arts have been our passion since high-school. Originally we wanted to create controllers for ourselves, but as our ideas matured, we decided to take it one step further. From late night jam sessions, to late night office hours. From DIY Synthesizers to twelve-hour drives to Berlin. Now here we are inviting you to be a part of this exciting journey!</p><p>We believe that Grid will be an ever growing project involving more and more creative people around the world.</p><table height=""352"" style=""margin:0px auto;text-align: center;"" width=""544""><tbody>

<li>ANA4 Module will feature a display allowing it to load different settings and presets to the other controllers.</li>
<li>Depending on the demand we may release a dedicated transport control / clock source / midi hub module with a built-in display.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Does it have 5-pin DIN MIDI port?</strong></p><ul>
<li>No, but a USB Midi to DIN midi adapter can be used to solve that since the Grid is a Class Compliant USB HID Midi device.</li>
<li>ANA4 Module will feature MIDI, CV, GATE and CLOCK through TRS jack connectors.</li>
</ul><p><strong>What's the latency? (Simple answer)</strong></p><ul><li>Can be as low as 5ms depending on the computer and operating system.</li></ul><p><strong>What's the latency? (More technical explanation)</strong></p><ul>
<li>The perceived latency adds up from four main components. The DAW's audio processing engine, the audio drivers and settings, the operating system's USB stack and the USB Midi device itself.</li>
<li>Using a studio microphone we measured the time difference from hitting a button on the controller to hearing the drum sound from the  speakers.</li>
<li>Using an M-audio sound card in a Windows 7 workstation running Ableton Live 10, we measured 5ms latency. (Audio sample Rate: 44.1k, WDM Buffer: 64 samples)</li>
<li>When you build a large control surface using the Grid, the module furthest away from one connected to USB will have the largest latency. Worst case added latency is currently &lt;1ms per module distance. (may improve with firmware upgrade)</li>
</ul><p><strong>Is there a brain module?</strong></p><ul><li>All of the modules feature a Type-C USB connector, any one of them can be used as the centerpiece of the control surface.</li></ul><p><strong>How many modules can be used at the same time?</strong></p><ul>
<li>Up to 16 modules can be connected when using a 5V 3A capable USB port.</li>
<li>The maximum brightness of the LEDs can be limited to allow even more controllers to be connected.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Can the modules be rotated?</strong></p><ul>

All of the user interface components are carefully selected for superior electrical performance and mechanical reliability. We use the USB Type-C connector because it offers better power capability,  convenient reversibility and guaranteed 10,000 mating cycles.
Grid modules interconnect through a custom designed magnetic interface. The spring loaded connectors are designed for maximum reliability. The gold plating on the connectors allows them to be resistant to corrosion.
The new conductive plastic technology pontentiometers and linear faders in the PO16 and PBF4 modules are rated for 100,000 cycles, while the Omron buttons in the BO16 and PBF4 modules are rated for 3,000,000 cycles.

Configure, edit and personalize.
Grid modules offer unmatched control possibilities. We already implemented midi channel and control number settings, control change and note messages, 7-bit and 14-bit resolution (NRPN),  toggle, momentary and step modes.

Grid in Press

""So you want to create your ideal MIDI controller, but don't want to go DIY and would rather have a system where each module fits together and looks really great? Say hello to GRID from Intech Studios."" - Ask Audio
""The three starting modules are great choices. You can easily see how you would use them and arrange them for controlling all sorts of stuff."" - Gearnews
""Not only are the Grid modules modular, but you can re-arrange them on the fly, and they’ll adapt automatically to their new context."" - Synthtopia
""According to Intech, one of the ideas behind Grid is to blur the line between software and hardware control."" - AudioNewsRoom
Timeline
The Grid already works. Now our number one priority is to start the tooling process as soon as possible. Once we are happy with the enclosure, we can focus on the PCB Assembly and testing. Finalizing the firmware and the software components is the last piece of the puzzle.

Launching the first three modules is just the beginning of the journey. We will use our tools and manufacturing chain to create new modules. Most of the firmware and the hardware designs can also be reused, further reducing the development time, helping us to release new controllers as frequently as possible. Every new Grid module will work flawlessly with modules released in the past.TeamMusic, electronics and arts have been our passion since high-school. Originally we wanted to create controllers for ourselves, but as our ideas matured, we decided to take it one step further. From late night jam sessions, to late night office hours. From DIY Synthesizers to twelve-hour drives to Berlin. Now here we are inviting you to be a part of this exciting journey!We believe that Grid will be an ever growing project involving more and more creative people around the world.

Shipping options are set up accordingly.For our backers outside the EU import charges may apply based on local regulation. For backers in the EU, no additional import charges apply.Risks & ChallengesWe have chosen crowdfunding to help us bring Grid to the world faster. Creating such product involves expensive manufacturing methods like injection molding. We have standing quotes for all of the components, our manufacturing partners are waiting for us to hit the 'Play' button.The electronic component market is always full of surprises. Component shortages and increased lead times can delay the manufacturing process. Once the campaign is successfully funded, we will start tooling process. In order to ensure the availability of the parts needed, we already took steps to work with long-term logistics partners to ease worldwide material flow.FAQWhy is there no display?
ANA4 Module will feature a display allowing it to load different settings and presets to the other controllers.
Depending on the demand we may release a dedicated transport control / clock source / midi hub module with a built-in display.
Does it have 5-pin DIN MIDI port?
No, but a USB Midi to DIN midi adapter can be used to solve that since the Grid is a Class Compliant USB HID Midi device.
ANA4 Module will feature MIDI, CV, GATE and CLOCK through TRS jack connectors.
What's the latency? (Simple answer)Can be as low as 5ms depending on the computer and operating system.What's the latency? (More technical explanation)
The perceived latency adds up from four main components. The DAW's audio processing engine, the audio drivers and settings, the operating system's USB stack and the USB Midi device itself.
Using a studio microphone we measured the time difference from hitting a button on the controller to hearing the drum sound from the  speakers.
Using an M-audio sound card in a Windows 7 workstation running Ableton Live 10, we measured 5ms latency. (Audio sample Rate: 44.1k, WDM Buffer: 64 samples)
When you build a large control surface using the Grid, the module furthest away from one connected to USB will have the largest latency. Worst case added latency is currently <1ms per module distance. (may improve with firmware upgrade)
Is there a brain module?All of the modules feature a Type-C USB connector, any one of them can be used as the centerpiece of the control surface.How many modules can be used at the same time?
Up to 16 modules can be connected when using a 5V 3A capable USB port.
The maximum brightness of the LEDs can be limited to allow even more controllers to be connected.
Can the modules be rotated?
Grid control modules can be connected in any orientation.
Rotation of a module can even be mapped to different midi parameters.

<h2><b>Your Input is Valuable and Needed! </b></h2>
<p>During our last Indiegogo Campaign for the Vero Headphone Cable, we relied on the feedback from our backers to create our personal line of audio products, something we had never done before in our more than 30 years as an award winning audio interface manufacturer. Now, as we venture into a groundbreaking new product, the first of its kind, we need your input more than ever before to help us determine which version of the Vero HCA we bring to market. </p>
<h3>FAQ's</h3>
<h4>Q: What is Multipole<b>™</b> Technology and how is applied to the Vero HCA-29? </h4>
<div><span style=""font-size: 18px;line-height: 24px;background-color: initial;""><p><b>A:</b> <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Multipole<b>™</b> Technology works to overcome inefficiencies in audio interfacing. It works the same way on the active circuits from Aaron Reiff and Bruce Brisson. That is, it has MIT input circuit technology and output technology (just like our cables) for a total of 29 poles.  With this combination, the HCA-29 delivers a linear articulation response AND high current!</span></p>
<div>
<h4>Q: If I'm an early backer, will my perk be shipped first?  </h4>
<p></p>
<h4>A: <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: normal;letter-spacing: 0px;line-height: 26px;background-color: initial;"">Vero Amp backers who opt in first will be shipped in the same order they backed the campaign. We will form a ""production queue"" as we get more backers. We project a production throughput of 5-9 units/wk so early backers will be rewarded.</span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;letter-spacing: 0px;line-height: 26px;font-weight: normal;background-color: initial;""> </span>

<h4>Q: How long will it take before you begin shipping?  </h4>
<h4>A: <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: normal;letter-spacing: 0px;line-height: 26px;background-color: initial;"">We believe that once the campaign has funded, it should take 30 to 45 days to receive the the parts for the campaign. However, delays in parts delivery may occur. We want to anticipate and minimize backorder issues with parts suppliers but this date cannot be guaranteed as exact. There is always a chance we may ship earlier, but we would rather side with caution. As we learned in the Vero Headphone campaign (we ran over by ~90 days) fulfilling orders are the top priority, but quality is number one. Ship dates are based on the order of backer funding, but factory throughput will be constant until all orders are filled. </span><br/>

<div>
<h4>Q: Does the HCA 29 include an impedance switch for IEM's?   </h4>
<h4>A: <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: normal;letter-spacing: 0px;line-height: 26px;background-color: initial;"">We have decided not to include a circuit for IEM's. Why?</span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: normal;letter-spacing: 0px;line-height: 26px;background-color: initial;"">We were tasked with ""making the MIT sound"" come from tiny IEM motors.  We tried a few ""familiar"" ways to address the IEM question but never reached a point where it met our standard. Perhaps it is due to differing quality In-Ear Monitors, but we just don't have the time to sort this out in 30 days, the span of the launch. After much discussion, we decided not to include it in this campaign. However, we reserve the right to offer this feature as an upgrade in the future. MIT products are legendary for providing a realistic listening experience, best described as holographic. </span>

<div>
<h4>Q: How long does the Battery Charge last on the Vero HCA 29? </h4>
<h4>A: <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: normal;letter-spacing: 0px;line-height: 26px;background-color: initial;"">We are still finalizing the battery choice but early tests reveal a 2-3 hour charge will play about 16 hours.</span><br/>
</h4>
<h4>Q: Can I use the Vero HCA 29 while it's charging?</h4>
<h4>A: <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: normal;letter-spacing: 0px;line-height: 26px;background-color: initial;"">Yes you can but the sound will include any line noise from your AC, including the power supply. Battery power (quiet power)  is a main feature of this design and critical listening should always be done with the charging circuit disconnected or unplugged. Besides a black background this feature also makes it ""transportable"" to any location in your home or on the road.  The footprint is only 8 1/2"" X 11"" X 3 1/2"" tall. </span>
</h4>
<h4></h4>
<h4></h4>
<h4>Q: <span style=""background-color: initial;"">If you already have the Vero Reference Headphone Cable in combination with the Bass Dongle and an additional adapter, will a future purchase of the Vero HCA 29 still have any added value on top of the network-cables, or is that rather too much of a good thing? </span>
</h4>
<h4>A: <span style=""font-weight: normal;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;letter-spacing: 0px;line-height: 26px;background-color: initial;"">Technically, you can apply Multipole to each component to optimize the signal throughput. That said, when you couple the Dongle to another Dongle and then to a headphone cable, you CAN get too much of a good thing!</span>

Who needs the Vero Headphone Amp?
Anyone who has an appreciation for authentic and true sound in music. After all, Vero means ""True"" in Italian.. Music lovers will appreciate the simple, basic design that makes the Vero HCA 29 easy to use with any music source and headphone. Because it is battery powered, the Vero's portable deign provides an amazing listening experience anywhere you desire. 
Musicians, composers and sound and recording engineers love Vero for its ability to attain each and every nuance of their recording. When writing music and scores, every note needs to be present, and with other devices, you won't achieve the best articulation points of sound frequencies without Multipole Technology, therefore, not allowing the ""true"" sound to come through. With Vero, and our patented Multipole Technology, every note, nuance, vocal, whisper, chord change, depth and texture of the music is present, all with a larger than life soundstage that allows the user to be present with the music as it is being played. 



How it works
The Vero Headphone Amp works like any other, except for the fact that it is battery powered, and doesn't need an electrical supply in order for it to work. You can plug any music source that runs off of an 1/8"" input (like the cable from your phone, or any other MP3 or digital music player or source). You can also plug into the Vero HCA 29 through the RCA inputs on the back of the amp. 

There are two outputs on the front panel, 1/4"" and XLR which are common inputs on most headphones. Once the Vero HCA 29 has a full charge, turn it on, plug your music source into the amp and your headphones into the front panel. You operate your music source as you would normally, except now the signal is running through the Vero HCA 29 and out to your headphones. Vero HCA 29 Product Specs

Our Story
MIT Cables has been manufacturing high-end audio interfaces for more than three decades, bringing award winning products and solutions to home audio and professional recording studios around the world. 
Until now, Multipole™ Technology has only been housed within the little network “boxes” found on all of MIT Cables’ award-winning products, which have been used on many Academy Award winning film scores and Grammy Award winning recordings. For the first time ever, MIT is now putting this technology inside of a non-cable product, and the results are stunning!
The Vero HCA•29 Headphone Amp is the only headphone amp in the world housed with Multipole™ Technology. This new breakthrough product was was designed with the help of Aaron Reiff, former Chief Engineer at Lucasfilm's Skywalker Sound and former audio engineer at Capital Studios, Hollywood.

exclusive Poles of Articulation, named after
the fact that every audio signal has a single point where it is most
efficient at storing and transporting energy. At this point in the audio
frequency spectrum, the notes will articulate best, and represents the audio’s

Graph A: Represents the bandwidth of the audible range of the human ear. We will use this graph to describe how well a component articulates across the audible bandwidth. The 50% line serves as our baseline for articulation response.Graph B: This articulation plot describes an Articulation Pole tuned to a high frequency, described by audiophiles as “bright” or “fast.” Conversely, an Articulation Pole tuned to a lower frequency would be described by audiophiles as “muddy” or “veiled.” MIT Cables’ networks are engineered to have multiple Articulation Poles optimized for the lows, mids, and highs. Our Poles of Articulation synergistically work together to transport the audio signal with a more even, linear response. Graph C: This conceptual illustration shows how Multipole™ Technology works synergistically throughout the audio spectrum. Poles A & B provide an area of better bass, Poles C & D provide an area of better midrange, and Poles E & F provide an area of better highs. When you reduce noise, audio fidelity improves proportionally. Just like rolling the windows up in your car to listen to your car radio, there is no simpler way to improve audio fidelity. Similarly, if we decouple our audio electronics from AC power (60hz) and power them with DC (direct current) there is a plethora of low level detail to be retrieved. This is due to the contrast of a background that is for the most part “silent”.The Vero HCA•29 works on this principal, relying on two rechargeable lithium ion batteries to enable the “high end headphone enthusiast” to enjoy performance  similar to two channel systems found in the world’s finest audio salons. With the proper sources and a good set of modern headphones, listening to music through the Vero HCA•29 is commonly referred to as a “totally immersive” experience.Perks!

A: Multipole™ Technology works to overcome inefficiencies in audio interfacing. It works the same way on the active circuits from Aaron Reiff and Bruce Brisson. That is, it has MIT input circuit technology and output technology (just like our cables) for a total of 29 poles.  With this combination, the HCA-29 delivers a linear articulation response AND high current!

Q: If I'm an early backer, will my perk be shipped first?  

A: Vero Amp backers who opt in first will be shipped in the same order they backed the campaign. We will form a ""production queue"" as we get more backers. We project a production throughput of 5-9 units/wk so early backers will be rewarded. 


Q: How long will it take before you begin shipping?  
A: We believe that once the campaign has funded, it should take 30 to 45 days to receive the the parts for the campaign. However, delays in parts delivery may occur. We want to anticipate and minimize backorder issues with parts suppliers but this date cannot be guaranteed as exact. There is always a chance we may ship earlier, but we would rather side with caution. As we learned in the Vero Headphone campaign (we ran over by ~90 days) fulfilling orders are the top priority, but quality is number one. Ship dates are based on the order of backer funding, but factory throughput will be constant until all orders are filled. 



Q: Does the HCA 29 include an impedance switch for IEM's?   
A: We have decided not to include a circuit for IEM's. Why?We were tasked with ""making the MIT sound"" come from tiny IEM motors.  We tried a few ""familiar"" ways to address the IEM question but never reached a point where it met our standard. Perhaps it is due to differing quality In-Ear Monitors, but we just don't have the time to sort this out in 30 days, the span of the launch. After much discussion, we decided not to include it in this campaign. However, we reserve the right to offer this feature as an upgrade in the future. MIT products are legendary for providing a realistic listening experience, best described as holographic. 


Q: How long does the Battery Charge last on the Vero HCA 29? 
A: We are still finalizing the battery choice but early tests reveal a 2-3 hour charge will play about 16 hours.

Q: Can I use the Vero HCA 29 while it's charging?
A: Yes you can but the sound will include any line noise from your AC, including the power supply. Battery power (quiet power)  is a main feature of this design and critical listening should always be done with the charging circuit disconnected or unplugged. Besides a black background this feature also makes it ""transportable"" to any location in your home or on the road.  The footprint is only 8 1/2"" X 11"" X 3 1/2"" tall. 



Q: If you already have the Vero Reference Headphone Cable in combination with the Bass Dongle and an additional adapter, will a future purchase of the Vero HCA 29 still have any added value on top of the network-cables, or is that rather too much of a good thing? 

A: Technically, you can apply Multipole to each component to optimize the signal throughput. That said, when you couple the Dongle to another Dongle and then to a headphone cable, you CAN get too much of a good thing!



Risks and Challenges


There are always risks involved with any crowdfunding campaign, and sometimes there are circumstances beyond our control that may delay the production of the Vero HCA 29. All of us here working on the Vero HCA Project are extremely confident in our ability to deliver MIT's first ever non-cable product in a timely manner! 
This is our second crowdfunding campaign, and we are proud to say that we have completed our first project and have hundreds of happy backers who have provided us with exceptional feedback on our last campaign. So we have a bit of experience under our belt! 
We have been working on the design of the Vero HCA for over 6 months with our engineers and have done most of the hard work of developing the best headphone amp we are certain you have ever experienced, and do not foresee any complications to our product development that would delay your shipment within the time frame that we have established. 
Of course, there is always a chance that our part suppliers have backorders or that Mother Nature decides to wreak havoc on any of our preparations, but we do not expect this or any other unforeseen acts of God or others to hinder our production schedule and anticipate shipping on time. 
We will make sure to update our backers frequently on any progress or delays in production or shipping.",17.0,1,"6 Campaigns

</p><p><b>Q: Why a geeRaf?<span><br/></span></b><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">A: </b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Because the geeRaf is the ONLY device that addresses the actual cause of ALL the common problems, and fixes everything - all without creating new issues or problems. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><b>Q: Why geeRaf - Tame Your Cables?<span><br/></span></b><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">A: </b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">It’s worn on the neck and if you think about necks for long enough, you’ll eventually think of a giraffe.  Then there’s the wild animal - wild cables thing, and to avoid any overzealous litigation from Tanzania, we went with geeRaf not giraffe.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><b>Q: Will it work with the earphones I have now?<span><br/></span></b><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">A:</b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> Yes. It will work with virtually any set of earphones including round and flat cables, asymmetric and in-line controller sets. It will accommodate cable diameters up to 3 mm - regular cables are 1.4 - 1.6 mm.  The geeRaf can be used with $5 budget-buds or $2500 audiophile-grade earphones.  If you swim or paddle and use waterproof earphones, the geeRaf will work flawlessly with those too.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><b>Q: Is it comfortable?<span><br/></span></b><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">A:</b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> Yes - very. The geeRaf is ergonomically shaped and completely adjustable so it can be customized to fit perfectly.  It's like wearing a 0.4 oz. necklace - practically unnoticeable.  </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><b>Q: Really?<span><br/></span></b><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">A:</b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> Yes, really.  We get it, the idea of putting something on your neck is a little weird, but once you try it, the only thing you’ll notice is the absence of all those hassles and the added convenience.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><b>Q: Is the geeRaf durable?<span><br/></span></b><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">A:</b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> Yes.  Stainless steel, laser-welded connections, stress-engineered… everything is high quality.  Colored geeRafs are powder-coated with durable, non-toxic PTFE which flexes with the geeRaf and repels dirt and sweat.  It will outlast set after set of earphones.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><b>Q: What about other options?<span><br/></span></b><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">A:</b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> The geeRaf is vastly superior to other ‘solutions’ such as specially-shaped earpieces, ear hooks, neck-bands or sports-headphones, because it fixes ALL the problems, not just one. Unlike a wireless set, there are no batteries to charge, no excessive drain on your device, and audio quality is not compromised. The geeRaf is vastly more convenient than ANY other set of earphones or wireless set - try temporarily removing one or both earpieces on other products and see what happens.  Best of all, you get to use the earphones you like, and the geeRaf just makes them better.</span></p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><br/></span></p>

It took me a while to realize that the best thing about Wave is not only that it can replace some of the tools you already have to control stuff when you are making music, but that it can make you control stuff in a completely different way, therefore making decisions that you would have never made without it. It’s a cool tool for all creatives and I can definitely recommend adding it to your workflow, whether you use it to replace your old techniques or invent new ones.""</i></p><h3 style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>Bergur Þórisson</strong></h3><p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>Recording engineer and producer, clients include Björk, Sigur Rós, Damien Rice, Ólafur Arnalds and Jóhann Jóhannsson</strong></p><p style=""margin-left:40px;""><br/><i>""This is going to be extremely useful for me both on stage or in the studio.

Following a successful campaign they have estimated that Wave will ship in December 2018.<br/> </p><p><strong>What makes Wave unique?</strong></p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Wave gives you a layer of creative control as it can work with the instruments you already use, allowing you to do more with what you have. It also works by itself connected to a DAW, mobile application or Wavefront, our Eurorack module. You can see more of the features that define Wave in the infograph above.<br/> </p><p><strong>Can I use it with X? - What can I use Wave with?</strong></p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Wave is Bluetooth MIDI compatible and shows up as a standard MIDI controller. What that means is that Wave works with most music software and mobile apps right out of the box!<br/><br/>Software that we have tested includes Ableton Live, Logic Pro X, Pro Tools, Reaper, Bitwig, Studio One, FL Studio, Garage Band and G-Stomper Studio/Rhythm as well as VDJ software such as VDMX5 (All tested on Mac OSX, most also tested on Windows 10 as well).<br/><br/>If you are using software that is not on this list, hit us up and we'll try it out for you.<br/> </p><p><strong>Does Wave generate sound?</strong></p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Wave is an expressive MIDI controller that you connect to the music software or app of your choice. The music software generates the audio that you can control with Wave.<br/> </p><p><strong>Can I use multiple Waves at the same time?</strong></p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">You can have multiple Waves connected at the same time, it's actually a lot of fun! For example you can do two-handed drum beats or have a great party with your friends! We have tried connecting up to five Waves on Mac OS X without any noticeable drawbacks. In any case, the total number of Bluetooth devices connected simultaneously is limited by the device Wave is connecting to.<br/> </p><p><strong>Can I buy one Wave for each finger and my toes?</strong></p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Hey, that sounds like fun! We hadn't thought of that ourselves. That being said, Wave is primarily designed to be worn on the index finger of either hand, but there is nothing stopping you from putting it on your toes as well.<br/> </p><p><strong>Will Wave improve my life?</strong></p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">It will move you in Waves you couldn't even begin to fathom..<br/> </p><p><strong>What is the latency like?</strong></p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">None of the artists that we have worked with have mentioned latency as being a limiting factor on our beta versions. If you would like to hear what kind of latency you should be expect, please have a look at any of our videos where all audio/video is recorded live.</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">The latency you experience depends on the device you connect Wave to. It is difficult to set a upper bound on latency for normal operating systems. However, using our Wavefront module we expect the latency to be lower than 5 ms on average.  <br/> </p><p><strong>What kind of software do I need?</strong></p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">That totally depends on what you would like to do with Wave!

The version we currently have has the main functionality working great and tested by hundreds of musicians. Last November Wave was used on stage for the first time at the Iceland Airwaves music festival.This campaign marks the next step of development, the manufacturing phase. We partnered with Anamaly, an award winning design firm to help us finalize the design, and Haltian, an experienced product development partner, to get Wave ready for mass manufacturing.Now, with your support, we can raise the necessary funds to begin mass production and ship Wave to music makers all over the world by the end of the year. Control parameters using the movement of your hand.Click the buttons to send commands, such as play, stop or record.Trigger samples by tapping any surface.  ""Out in the desolate wastes of deepest Iceland, magic blooms. The Icelandic sagas tell of fairy houses to magical rings that control the world, and now one of those, the Wave, has landed on the internet.""TechCrunch""For someone who has a setup they like but wants a novel way to tweak parameters with hand motions and maybe trigger a drum pad or two, the Wave wearable MIDI controller from Genki Instruments is an interesting option.""The Verge""The usefulness to musicians seems clear; wearing the controller lets you play your instrument or tweak your software while gesturing to control various effects or sounds on the fly.""Engadget""Wave isn’t the only gesture-controlled wearable to have hit the market in recent years, but it does look as if it could be one of the most practical to use, especially as you can still play your instrument of choice with one equipped.""FACT Magazine""We’ve seen finger-mounted controllers before - but Wave looks to be more sophisticated than most.""MusicRadar""It’s one of the cooler tech inventions we’ve seen as of late.”BigShot Magazine""Cool factor 128/128 - Weirdness factor 128/128 - A perfect score.""ButtonPushersUnited""But one feature brings an added dimension we’ve not seen before in a ring based controller, and also accounts for its chunkiness, and that’s a bunch of buttons.""Gearnews""Wave is ideal for shaping your sounds while playing or DJ-ing - for example, mapping it to control effects in TRAKTOR frees up your fingers for other duties.""Kim Bjørn author of Push Turn Move (Native Instrument blog)""Genki Instruments and their connected MIDI ring, Wave is probably one of the coolest music products straight from the Nordics.""Arctic Startup""At this year's NAMM Show there were a lot of great new products on display from manufacturers. One of those products was introduced by Genki Instruments. The Wave is a wireless-capable and -- get this -- wearable MIDI controller.""Deviant Noise Wave has been developed in close collaboration with musicians. Their input has proven vital in creating something musicians will love and trust. This is what people that have tried Wave have to say:""So bottom line, Wave is a ton of fun and it's definitely something I'd recommend if you play live and want to introduce more expression and modulation into your music.""

""Wave is an innovative new way to add expression and nuance to electronic performances! Wave is simple to use, and gives me powerful control right from my fingers without having to take them away from my instrument.""David MashRetired Senior Vice President, Berklee College of MusicElectronic Guitarist/Composer, Mashine Music""Wave adds a new dimension to musical creativity. It took me a while to realize that the best thing about Wave is not only that it can replace some of the tools you already have to control stuff when you are making music, but that it can make you control stuff in a completely different way, therefore making decisions that you would have never made without it. It’s a cool tool for all creatives and I can definitely recommend adding it to your workflow, whether you use it to replace your old techniques or invent new ones.""Bergur ÞórissonRecording engineer and producer, clients include Björk, Sigur Rós, Damien Rice, Ólafur Arnalds and Jóhann Jóhannsson""This is going to be extremely useful for me both on stage or in the studio. I’m most comfortable doing things fast and live so I can't wait to start using Wave, whether it’s going to be for recording automation, controlling effects on stage or just finger-tapping drums.""Helgi Sæmundur GuðmundssonProducer for Úlfur Úlfur / Film Composer""It's great for live performances and using it comes naturally.... [Wave is] like an extension of your voice.""aYiaFirst band to use Wave live""Wave makes digital so much more natural. Ideas can come alive in the spur of the moment which makes performing extra exciting.""Örn Ýmir ArasonComposer / Musician""Up until now I've been controlling effects through buttons and slides, with the ring I can designate some of those effects to be hands-free. It feels more natural, visual and cool.""MIMRASinger / Songwriter ""Wave is a must have controller for studio work. Whether you want to use it while you record or to volumeride effects in post production. I can't wait to use it live.""Ármann Ingvi ÁrmannssonMusician ""No wires, no setup, no bullshit!""Kári EinarssonOYAMA  Influence your guitar sound while playing.Shape effects on your voice while singing.Tap any surface to trigger samples and one shots.  Modulate your sound with both hands on the keyboard.Engage with the audience when DJ-ing.Enhance your drumming.Play around and have fun with music! Wave w/keyboard at The 2019 NAMM Show

  Controlling parameters is usually controlled with your mouse or turning knobs and moving sliders. Wave allows you to do the same using movements.Play with both hands on a keyboard and affect the sound only by tilting your hand, engage better with your audience by controlling effects with large movements or record modulation with small, nuanced gestures.Triggers allow you to trigger samples or MIDI notes either by tapping your finger on any surface or by clicking one of the buttons.You can for instance tap in the tempo, trigger drum samples or send commands such as play, stop and record.  Wave is Bluetooth MIDI compatible and shows up as a standard MIDI controller. In other words, Wave works with all major music software and mobile apps right out of the box!Software that we have tested includes Ableton Live, Logic Pro X, Pro Tools, Reaper, Bitwig, Studio One, FL Studio, Garage Band and G-Stomper Studio/Rhythm as well as VJ software such as VDMX5.If you are using software that is not on this list, hit us up and we'll try it out for you.Are you still unsure about how to set up Wave with your DAW? Easy to follow tutorial videos will be available when Wave ships. Wave can store up to seven patches at any time. A patch is any combination of the functions Wave has to offer, tilt, pan, roll, tap and click. You can configure each patch to suit your needs. Explore new ways to interact with your modular setup with Wavefront, the Eurorack receiver module for Wave. Wavefront allows you to seamlessly integrate movements, triggers and gates into your modular setup!Wavefront features five outputs, three CV out for movements and two gates for tap and clicks. It has a compact size (HP4), is skiff-friendly and offers ultra-low latency.Configure your own movements and scale the output CVs and gate levels to your liking. We have partnered with with great companies to make Wave a reality.  We have been developing Wave for three years in close collaboration with musicians. The design process has been fun yet arduous and full of prototypes and iterations. Below you can see some of the early prototypes and how Wave has evolved during development.Perhaps one of the more notable ideas is that of an interactive hologram screen. You can imagine the tension between the designer and engineers that followed...As soon as we had the first prototype ready we began working with musicians to learn how they would use our novel invention. We soon discovered artists wanted more interactive control of their music software. Turning Wave into a ring opened up the possibility to add buttons that could be controlled with the thumb.In the summer of 2016 we had the first prototype of a ring ready. It was still quite chunky and not exactly user-friendly. We still had a lot of work to do.As you can see we have been through many, many prototypes and ideas. We firmly believe that this process has produced a product that music makers will love to use. The industrial design was finalized with help from the talented team over at Anamaly. The collaboration proved invaluable in perfecting the design and functionality into what we share with you today.Last February we travelled to Oulu to meet Haltian, our manufacturing partner. Together we are hard at work on the final mechanical and electrical designs. In the coming months we need to source electrical components, strike a deal with vendors and manufacture professional prototypes until we are content with the overall quality. With calibration, testing and quality control taken care of we will ship Wave out to the first backers in December. Along the way we have been honoured to receive recognition for our work. Genki Instruments ‘Wave’ is a wearable MIDI controller that allows a musician to control sound with only a hand motion. The panel determined that the nuance and non-intrusiveness of the tool innovates the musical process, allowing artists to make quick decisions that were previously unavailable. “The way they have integrated design with the technological process is a good example of what design can do.”Award of Excellence - Grapevine Design Awards 2018Product of the Year. Genki Instruments is an Icelandic company that was founded in 2015 around the intersection of music and technology. Ólafur Bjarki Bogason and Daníel Grétarsson, newly graduated engineering students with a deep passion for music, started to search for ways to make technology in music more expressive and intuitive. They soon attracted Jón Helgi Hólmgeirsson, an award winning designer and Haraldur Hugosson to take care of the business side. With a versatile team in place they set off on a mission to make technology in music feel natural.Wave is our first product and we are excited to share it with you!Ólafur Bjarki Bogason - Chief Executive OfficerB.Sc.

In a case of cancellation your pledge will be refunded by Genki Instruments.Please note that there may be additional duties, fees or taxes raised by the authorities in your country. You may meed to take care of them yourself upon receiving the shipment.Shipping and handling cost is $15 to all countries.We have been developing Wave for three years in close collaboration with musicians. Now we truly believe that we have a product ready for mass market. However, prototypes only get you so far. We have partnered with Haltian, an experienced manufacturing firm, who will help us set up a production line and take Wave all the way. This is a complex process, and while we believe we have a good estimate on the time required, unforeseen delays are always possible.The look of the final product may vary slightly from the renders you see here. This is an unavoidable part of the productization phase. We have tried our best to take all important factors into account while designing this product. Minor variations during the productization phase should not impact the device’s functionality.We have working prototypes of Wavefront which we will share with you shortly. The core functionality will remain as advertised, although the look may change slightly during the manufacturing phase. When will Wave start shipping?We’re working with Haltian, an experienced production partner to mass produce Wave. Following a successful campaign they have estimated that Wave will ship in December 2018. What makes Wave unique?Wave gives you a layer of creative control as it can work with the instruments you already use, allowing you to do more with what you have. It also works by itself connected to a DAW, mobile application or Wavefront, our Eurorack module. You can see more of the features that define Wave in the infograph above. Can I use it with X? - What can I use Wave with?Wave is Bluetooth MIDI compatible and shows up as a standard MIDI controller. What that means is that Wave works with most music software and mobile apps right out of the box!Software that we have tested includes Ableton Live, Logic Pro X, Pro Tools, Reaper, Bitwig, Studio One, FL Studio, Garage Band and G-Stomper Studio/Rhythm as well as VDJ software such as VDMX5 (All tested on Mac OSX, most also tested on Windows 10 as well).If you are using software that is not on this list, hit us up and we'll try it out for you. Does Wave generate sound?Wave is an expressive MIDI controller that you connect to the music software or app of your choice. The music software generates the audio that you can control with Wave. Can I use multiple Waves at the same time?You can have multiple Waves connected at the same time, it's actually a lot of fun! For example you can do two-handed drum beats or have a great party with your friends! We have tried connecting up to five Waves on Mac OS X without any noticeable drawbacks. In any case, the total number of Bluetooth devices connected simultaneously is limited by the device Wave is connecting to. Can I buy one Wave for each finger and my toes?Hey, that sounds like fun! We hadn't thought of that ourselves. That being said, Wave is primarily designed to be worn on the index finger of either hand, but there is nothing stopping you from putting it on your toes as well. Will Wave improve my life?It will move you in Waves you couldn't even begin to fathom.. What is the latency like?None of the artists that we have worked with have mentioned latency as being a limiting factor on our beta versions. If you would like to hear what kind of latency you should be expect, please have a look at any of our videos where all audio/video is recorded live.The latency you experience depends on the device you connect Wave to. It is difficult to set a upper bound on latency for normal operating systems. However, using our Wavefront module we expect the latency to be lower than 5 ms on average.   What kind of software do I need?That totally depends on what you would like to do with Wave! For example if you would like to connect Wave to your current setup in Mac OS X you won't have to install anything at all; just pair Wave with your computer and use it like any other MIDI keyboard! The same goes with Android or iOS, where we like to use apps such as Garage Band and G-Stomper Rhythm to play with. Can I use Wave for something else than music?Absolutely! Wave is compatible out of the box with anything that can receive MIDI signals, for example the VJ software VDMX5. What kind of data does Wave send?Depending on how you would like to use Wave, it can send and/or receive MIDI CC signals and notes that are velocity sensitive. Why does the ring in the video look different than the one I'm buying?The ring in the video is the fully-functioning beta version of Wave, a version that is manufactured and assembled in Reykjavik by our team. This is the prototype we have been developing and testing with musicians for three years now. Instead of showing you a render, with post-production effects, we wanted to show you all the cool things Wave can do. The ring you are buying has the same main hardware but is mass manufacturable and looks a lot better than the current version. This is the Wave you will be helping us bring to the world! How do I charge Wave?Wave comes with a cable that snaps onto the device. This way you can use Wave while it’s charging. My computer doesn’t have Bluetooth LE, can I still use Wave?Don't panic!!! You can fix this by buying a cheap Bluetooth LE USB adapter and use it to connect to Wave. Does Wave come in different ring sizes?Wave has an adjustable strap that should fit most finger sizes. I want to use Wave in a live environment, it's sweat resistant right?It sure is, sweat on! Do we ship to your country?Wavers already exist all over the world and we will ship Wave worldwide.Please note that shipping to any country outside North America and EU/EFTA may be delayed or cancelled depending, e.g., on the feasibility of local type approval requirements or local import regulations. In a case of cancellation your pledge will be refunded by Genki Instruments.Please note that there may be additional duties, fees or taxes raised by the authorities in your country.

<p>Founded in September 2014, Inspero Inc. was started by two MIT MBA Alumni, David Zhu and Max Wu. Their vision was to completely rethink headphones by inventing a new way to experience and interact with sound.</p>
<p>The team now consists of 40 talented engineers and designers with many years of experience from companies such as Intel, Oracle, and Microsoft, and from universities such as MIT, Harvard, RISD, and Parsons.</p>
<p>Vinci is headquartered in Beijing with operations in Shenzhen, New York, and San Francisco.  Vinci made a strategic decision to be headquartered in China in order to take advantage of China’s robust and ever-innovating supply chain.</p>
<p>In October 2015, the company introduced its first Vinci headphones in China -- the device sold out within six months. The team at Vinci knew its dream of reinventing headphones and the way we interact with sound was a reality.</p>

<h1>The fine print</h1>
<p>International Backers:  We will ship Vinci worldwide, with the exception of Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, Libya, Myanmar/Burma, North Korea, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Ukraine, and Yemen. Please note that you will be responsible for duties, fees and taxes applicable to your region, which in the past have ranged from 0% to 20% in the US and EU countries, to as much as 200% for certain South American countries. </p>
<p>Estimated Delivery:  Each reward tier may have a different estimated shipment month. While we do not expect these to change, it is possible that the estimated shipment month may shift. We will provide updates if the estimated shipment date changes. At anytime up until your headphone has shipped, you may request a full refund by emailing ks@inspero.im. </p>
<p>Warranty:  We stand firmly behind our products. Each Vinci headset includes a 7-day (after you receive it) money back guarantee, 30-day free exchange, and 1-year limited warranty. Need help? We're here for you. If you have questions at any time, during or after the campaign has closed, you can always reach us at ks@inspero.im.</p>
<p>Disclaimers Notifications: Vinci headphones must be connected via either wifi/3G or to a smartphone via Bluetooth in order to receive notifications and perform other functions. Heart rate monitor: Vinci’s heart rate (HR) monitor is intended to be a valuable tool that can provide an accurate estimation of the user’s heart rate. </p>
<p>The HR monitor is designed to attempt to monitor a user’s heart rate on a periodic basis. The frequency at which heart rate is measured varies and depends on the level and activity of the user. Vinci headphones are not medical devices and you should not rely on the accuracy of heart rate data for any purpose, especially for medical or health purposes. </p>
<p>Battery life: Actual battery life will vary based in part on cellular network provider, your location and other factors.</p>
<p>3rd party applications: For 3rd party applications that are not native to, or included with, Vinci’s operating software such as Spotify, you must have an account set up with these services to be able to use them with your Vinci device. Additional fees and costs may apply to any such services. Use of third party services is subject to the service’s own terms and conditions.</p>
<p>Wireless charging pad: The wireless charging pad is not included with Vinci Standard.  It is only included with Vinci Pro. </p>
<p>Trademarks: Trademarks and names that belong to third parties. </p>
<p>Water resistance: Vinci is splash resistant but not waterproof. Incidental exposure to water–like unforeseeable rain–won’t ruin your device, but submerging the device is not recommended.</p>
<h2><strong>FAQs</strong></h2>
<p><strong>1. Does Vinci need to connect to my phone to work?</strong></p>
<p>No, Vinci can work completely independent from your phone. But, it can also connect to your phone via Bluetooth or wires.</p>
<p><strong>2. Where does the music come from?</strong></p>
<p>Currently, Vinci offers music streaming from your Spotify, SoundCloud, and Amazon Prime Music accounts.  Through future OTA software updates, Vinci can be connected music content services, such as Google Play, Pandora, iHeartRadio, iTunes Music, and more.  Alternatively, you can also upload songs directly into Vinci’s local storage.</p>
<p><strong>3. How big is Vinci’s local storage?</strong></p>
<p>Vinci’s local storage is 16GB and Vinci Pro’s local storage is 32GB.</p>
<p><strong>4. What are some main differences between Vinci and Vinci Pro?</strong></p>
<p>Vinci Pro offers several key points of value over regular Vinci:<br/>- Most simply, the larger storage.<br/>- ANC (Active Noise Cancelling), which requires two extra AMS3412 chips (industry top liners). Most other branded headphones with the ANC feature are typically priced over $200.<br/>- HiFi grade DAC. AKM3476 is a premium DAC for mobile devices that offeres HiFi grade sound quality (125Db S/N and -106Db THD).<br/>- Wireless charging, which is difficult to pull off. It requires engineering from the headphone side as well as the charging dock. We believe wireless charging makes Vinci a truly wireless headphone.</p>
<p><strong>5. How does Vinci connect to the internet?</strong></p>
<p>You can log into WiFi directly on Vinci.  Vinci is also enabled with standalone 3G connectivity that is compatible with AT&amp;T and T-Mobile.</p>
<p><strong>6. What languages are supported by Vinci?</strong></p>
<p>Currently, Vinci supports English.  However, we are quickly adding new languages in future OTA software updates.</p>
<p><strong>7. How do I choose colors?</strong></p>
<p>After the InDemand campaign, we will email all of our backers to allow them to choose colors.</p>
<p><strong>8. What does the cost of shipping cover?</strong></p>
<p>The shipping cost covers: 1) Overseas shipping. The final product is assembled in China thus the shipping cost was calculated based on origin of manufacturing. 2) We really want to make sure the product arrives promptly and in its best condition. Thus the shipping cost covers quality packaging materials while we work with reliable shipping companies to do this.</p>
<p><strong>9. Can you cache songs from the music services?</strong></p>
<p>We are currently working with these music providers, including Spotify, Amazon Prime Music, and others to provide this feature, which is already enabled with the SoundCloud service on the device.</p>
<p><strong>10. Will Vinci work with mobile networks in different countries?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, users will be able to find local carriers in most countries that support either configuration of the bands below: </p>
<p>Config I: Supports Band 2 and Band 5 (1900MHz and 850MHz, North America) <br/>Config II: Supports Band 1 and Band 8 (2100MHz and 900MHz, Asia, Europe, Australia)</p>
<p>We will send out surveys at the end of the campaign for you to choose your desired configuration.</p>
<p><strong>11. Does Vinci support languages other than English?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, additional language options is something we are definitely working on and will be available through future OTA updates.</p>
<p><strong>12. Can I turn the screen display off?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, you can press the power button to turn off the screen while music continues to play. This will preserve your battery, allowing it to last up to 14 hours.</p>
<p><strong>13. Will there be additional colors for pro?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, we are definitely considering additional colors.  Please stay tuned for updates.</p>
<p><strong>14. How long is playback via Bluetooth or local storage if the screen remains turned off?</strong></p>
<p>Playback via bluetooth will allow up to 50 hours battery life and via local storage will allow up to 12-14 hours.</p>
<p><strong>15. What is the radiation impact of long term usage on the brain?</strong></p>
<p>We care not only about users' music experience, but also most definitely their safety. So far, the device has been through rigorous tests related to cellular radiation, WiFi and Bluetooth. The device has passed the FCC (Federal Communications Commission) certification. We also optimized all WiFi and 3G signal to ensure smooth streaming while maintaining minimum power consumption.</p>
<p><strong>16. Does Vinci support Apple Music services?</strong></p>
<p>At the moment, to listen to Apple music, you can use bluetooth.</p>
<p><strong>17. Why are voice-assisted headphones useful?</strong></p>
<p>Voice-assistance helps users save time by allowing the user to simply say any song title, artist name, or genre.  Dictation actually can save people up to 3x the amount of time as typing.  We believe voice-assistance will aid the current music listening experience: turning on your phone, logging in with a password, opening a music streaming app, manually searching or typing to find songs.  With voice assistance, you can simply talk to choose songs.  If you are vacuuming, lifting weights, shopping, or doing any other activities which may occupy your hands, voice assistance will help you be able to control your music without affecting your other activities.</p>
<p><strong>18. For example, what type of files does the storage hold?</strong></p>
<p>We currently support MP3, AAC, AMR, FLAC, WAV, AIFF formats.</p>
<p><strong>19. Can you download apps within the Vinci itself? Or do they come pre-installed?</strong></p>
<p>We are planning to provide SDK to our developers community to create exciting and innovative third party apps on our headphones. The third party apps will be available via our in headphone app stores. Stay tuned for more updates.</p>
<p><strong>20. Will Vinci support multiple English accents apart from North American?</strong></p>
<p>So far, we have been testing mostly with standard American English, but we are planning to enable other accents (British English, Austrailian, etc.) very soon!</p>
</div></div>","Introducing Vinci, Headphones Reinvented* Wireless Charging and ANC for Vinci Pro only.Wire-free and phone-free, Vinci is perfect for joggers, travelers and all music lovers.  Vinci Smart Headphones are also featured onVisit Vinci on Facebook and Twitter. Find Press Kit here.Check out what Unbox Therapy thinks about the final product: Vinci allows you to voice control your music when manually choosing songs on your phone is inconvenient.  No matter what you're doing - walking, running, or commuting - you can tell Vinci exactly what song or artist you want to listen to, say a specific genre or mood, or let Vinci pick a song for you. Voice-controlled and hands-free, Vinci connects you with music requests, information, directions, local venue recommendations, reminders, and so much more. When you need Vinci's help, simply say ""Hey Vinci"" or use one finger to press and hold down on the touch screen, and Vinci will instantly recognize your voice command to assist you right away. Listen to any song with Spotify, Amazon Prime Music, or SoundCloud.Vinci is a standalone device, so there's no need to connect to or search your mobile phone. Enjoy total freedom when jogging, traveling, or commuting to work.Vinci also uses dual-mic noise reduction technology to filter out ambient noise from the desired sound, which improves voice recognition in any noisy environment.We held a product demo day in New York, and everyone loved our headphones!  Check out what New Yorkers have to say about Vinci's ""crisp and clear"" sound quality, comfort, and easy-to-use interface. Vinci senses and learns from your body vitals, activities, listening habits and preferences to make intelligent, real-time recommendations. You don't have to choose songs yourself. Vinci learns from your body and activity data to pick songs that match your pace, heart rate, and listening preferences.Vinci can anticipate what you want — from a song choice to an alternative travel route or commute type — before you even realize you need it. Vinci also includes an accelerometer, gyrometer, proximity sensor, optical heart rate sensor, GPS, and compass to deliver impressive personalization.Vinci AI Architecture With hundreds of thousands of soundtracks from massive music resources, Vinci learns the abstractive representations of songs, powered by deep learning techniques. Sounds will be extracted as signals, and then fed into neural networks after pre-processing.Bi-directional Long-Short Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) models the sequential patterns of inputs, while more than one layer of fully-connected neural networks (often known as Multi-Layer Perceptron) enables abstractive learning. User profiles are established by their behaviors (such as “like” or “dislike”) towards recommended songs. Such data are accumulated over time and modeled as temporal transition chains. With statistics learned, preferences are learned accordingly. In this way, Vinci becomes smarter when deciding what to or not to recommend next time, based on ""deep learned"" user-song matching.  The Most Interactive Headphones, EverVinci is super easy to use. Put the headphones on and music automatically plays. Remove them and music automatically pauses. Swipe forward/backward to easily change tracks. Swipe up/down to adjust volume.
Voice commands can be activated by saying ""Hey Vinci"" or using one finger to press and hold to talk.
Listen to text and voice messages read aloud to you by Vinci. 
Online and offline local storage means you can have anytime, anywhere access to your music, maps, information, and more.
Looks Like a Headphone, Acts Like a ComputerVinci is a standalone device with a powerful dual-core ARM Cortex-A7 processor, 16 to 32 GB of storage, and its own operating system, built on the Android platform. Vinci's platform technology is built in the cloud and is powered by natural language processing and artificial intelligence, so it gets smarter and smarter, learning from your speech patterns and preferences. Through its machine learning algorithms, the more you wear Vinci, the more intelligent and personalized it becomes.Key Features: 


Wireless Charging for Vinci Pro - A True Wireless Headphone. 
With 32GB storage, Vinci Pro holds up to 7000 songs in standard MP3 format 



Connect to internet via WiFi or 3G. When there's no internet available, Vinci also works in offline mode. 
Vinci supports standard Bluetooth 4.1 connection to your smartphones (iOS and Android) and computers, for music and calls. Vinci also syncs data with your phone via Bluetooth BLE.
Vinci has outstanding battery life - up to 3 weeks standby time, 50 hours of music playback via Bluetooth, or 10 hours standalone music playback on Vinci



Vinci is powered by Vinci Voice OS. Expect regular software updates (auto-updates when connected to the internet) to unlock many exciting new apps and features. 
Vinci is a super expandable platform based on Android. We plan to provide SDK for Vinci OS later and welcome our community and developers to create exciting apps on our headphone platform.
Vinci also supports 3.5mm audio jack, and can be used as traditional headphones for phones, computers, or any other music players. This mode works without consuming battery power of Vinci.


The combination of incredibly accurate sound placement plus Vinci’s integrated head tracking sensors delivers premium quality and immersive sound.

Founded in September 2014, Inspero Inc. was started by two MIT MBA Alumni, David Zhu and Max Wu. Their vision was to completely rethink headphones by inventing a new way to experience and interact with sound.
The team now consists of 40 talented engineers and designers with many years of experience from companies such as Intel, Oracle, and Microsoft, and from universities such as MIT, Harvard, RISD, and Parsons.
Vinci is headquartered in Beijing with operations in Shenzhen, New York, and San Francisco.  Vinci made a strategic decision to be headquartered in China in order to take advantage of China’s robust and ever-innovating supply chain.
In October 2015, the company introduced its first Vinci headphones in China -- the device sold out within six months. The team at Vinci knew its dream of reinventing headphones and the way we interact with sound was a reality.

Vinci Ready to Ship:

The fine print
International Backers:  We will ship Vinci worldwide, with the exception of Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, Libya, Myanmar/Burma, North Korea, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Ukraine, and Yemen. Please note that you will be responsible for duties, fees and taxes applicable to your region, which in the past have ranged from 0% to 20% in the US and EU countries, to as much as 200% for certain South American countries. 
Estimated Delivery:  Each reward tier may have a different estimated shipment month. While we do not expect these to change, it is possible that the estimated shipment month may shift. We will provide updates if the estimated shipment date changes. At anytime up until your headphone has shipped, you may request a full refund by emailing ks@inspero.im. 
Warranty:  We stand firmly behind our products. Each Vinci headset includes a 7-day (after you receive it) money back guarantee, 30-day free exchange, and 1-year limited warranty. Need help? We're here for you. If you have questions at any time, during or after the campaign has closed, you can always reach us at ks@inspero.im.
Disclaimers Notifications: Vinci headphones must be connected via either wifi/3G or to a smartphone via Bluetooth in order to receive notifications and perform other functions. Heart rate monitor: Vinci’s heart rate (HR) monitor is intended to be a valuable tool that can provide an accurate estimation of the user’s heart rate. 
The HR monitor is designed to attempt to monitor a user’s heart rate on a periodic basis. The frequency at which heart rate is measured varies and depends on the level and activity of the user. Vinci headphones are not medical devices and you should not rely on the accuracy of heart rate data for any purpose, especially for medical or health purposes. 
Battery life: Actual battery life will vary based in part on cellular network provider, your location and other factors.
3rd party applications: For 3rd party applications that are not native to, or included with, Vinci’s operating software such as Spotify, you must have an account set up with these services to be able to use them with your Vinci device. Additional fees and costs may apply to any such services. Use of third party services is subject to the service’s own terms and conditions.
Wireless charging pad: The wireless charging pad is not included with Vinci Standard.  It is only included with Vinci Pro. 
Trademarks: Trademarks and names that belong to third parties. 
Water resistance: Vinci is splash resistant but not waterproof. Incidental exposure to water–like unforeseeable rain–won’t ruin your device, but submerging the device is not recommended.
FAQs
1. Does Vinci need to connect to my phone to work?
No, Vinci can work completely independent from your phone. But, it can also connect to your phone via Bluetooth or wires.
2. Where does the music come from?
Currently, Vinci offers music streaming from your Spotify, SoundCloud, and Amazon Prime Music accounts.  Through future OTA software updates, Vinci can be connected music content services, such as Google Play, Pandora, iHeartRadio, iTunes Music, and more.  Alternatively, you can also upload songs directly into Vinci’s local storage.
3. How big is Vinci’s local storage?
Vinci’s local storage is 16GB and Vinci Pro’s local storage is 32GB.
4. What are some main differences between Vinci and Vinci Pro?
Vinci Pro offers several key points of value over regular Vinci:- Most simply, the larger storage.- ANC (Active Noise Cancelling), which requires two extra AMS3412 chips (industry top liners). Most other branded headphones with the ANC feature are typically priced over $200.- HiFi grade DAC. AKM3476 is a premium DAC for mobile devices that offeres HiFi grade sound quality (125Db S/N and -106Db THD).- Wireless charging, which is difficult to pull off. It requires engineering from the headphone side as well as the charging dock. We believe wireless charging makes Vinci a truly wireless headphone.
5. How does Vinci connect to the internet?
You can log into WiFi directly on Vinci.  Vinci is also enabled with standalone 3G connectivity that is compatible with AT&T and T-Mobile.
6. What languages are supported by Vinci?
Currently, Vinci supports English.  However, we are quickly adding new languages in future OTA software updates.
7. How do I choose colors?
After the InDemand campaign, we will email all of our backers to allow them to choose colors.
8. What does the cost of shipping cover?
The shipping cost covers: 1) Overseas shipping. The final product is assembled in China thus the shipping cost was calculated based on origin of manufacturing. 2) We really want to make sure the product arrives promptly and in its best condition. Thus the shipping cost covers quality packaging materials while we work with reliable shipping companies to do this.
9. Can you cache songs from the music services?
We are currently working with these music providers, including Spotify, Amazon Prime Music, and others to provide this feature, which is already enabled with the SoundCloud service on the device.
10. Will Vinci work with mobile networks in different countries?
Yes, users will be able to find local carriers in most countries that support either configuration of the bands below: 
Config I: Supports Band 2 and Band 5 (1900MHz and 850MHz, North America) Config II: Supports Band 1 and Band 8 (2100MHz and 900MHz, Asia, Europe, Australia)
We will send out surveys at the end of the campaign for you to choose your desired configuration.
11. Does Vinci support languages other than English?
Yes, additional language options is something we are definitely working on and will be available through future OTA updates.
12. Can I turn the screen display off?
Yes, you can press the power button to turn off the screen while music continues to play. This will preserve your battery, allowing it to last up to 14 hours.
13. Will there be additional colors for pro?
Yes, we are definitely considering additional colors.  Please stay tuned for updates.
14. How long is playback via Bluetooth or local storage if the screen remains turned off?
Playback via bluetooth will allow up to 50 hours battery life and via local storage will allow up to 12-14 hours.
15. What is the radiation impact of long term usage on the brain?
We care not only about users' music experience, but also most definitely their safety. So far, the device has been through rigorous tests related to cellular radiation, WiFi and Bluetooth. The device has passed the FCC (Federal Communications Commission) certification. We also optimized all WiFi and 3G signal to ensure smooth streaming while maintaining minimum power consumption.
16. Does Vinci support Apple Music services?
At the moment, to listen to Apple music, you can use bluetooth.
17. Why are voice-assisted headphones useful?
Voice-assistance helps users save time by allowing the user to simply say any song title, artist name, or genre.  Dictation actually can save people up to 3x the amount of time as typing.  We believe voice-assistance will aid the current music listening experience: turning on your phone, logging in with a password, opening a music streaming app, manually searching or typing to find songs.  With voice assistance, you can simply talk to choose songs.  If you are vacuuming, lifting weights, shopping, or doing any other activities which may occupy your hands, voice assistance will help you be able to control your music without affecting your other activities.
18. For example, what type of files does the storage hold?
We currently support MP3, AAC, AMR, FLAC, WAV, AIFF formats.
19. Can you download apps within the Vinci itself? Or do they come pre-installed?
We are planning to provide SDK to our developers community to create exciting and innovative third party apps on our headphones. The third party apps will be available via our in headphone app stores. Stay tuned for more updates.
20. Will Vinci support multiple English accents apart from North American?
So far, we have been testing mostly with standard American English, but we are planning to enable other accents (British English, Austrailian, etc.) very soon!",49.0,5,"2 Campaigns

Unique SQueo™ Features

We wanted SQueo™ to be both reliable and aesthetically pleasing. Test after test, we reached the the perfect alchemy: a screwless design!
SQueo™ technology is based on the highest level of waterproof capability available today (the IP68). In order to achieve this, the device had to be hermetically sealed. Our idea was to create a device compressed by two main covers with a rubber isolating element in between.

The Earity technology was created in an effort to reduce the number of 
traffic accidents and fatalities caused by cell phone use while driving.
 Music is a part of your and
our lives. It brings joy, excitement and motivation. However, headphones can
ruin it: cables tangle, pull at the headphones and ultimately break. Earity
liberates you from wires. Its stylish design is focused on delivering freedom of
movement, incredible sound and comfort. 
Easily connect Earity to your smartphone


Earity is created to keep you moving. Its
design guarantees that Earity will comfortably stay in
place, whatever crazy things you are going to
get involved in.

Earity will inform you about an incoming phone call by telling you the name of the person. Now it’s YOUR CHOICE, if you want to respond.Talk to your earbud: with Earity, you can accept or reject phone calls by saying “yes” or “no”.
No more bulky headphones:  Earity’s Cool, stylish design makes it a perfect accessory to complement your image.

Reliable storage
and charger in-one compact capsule: it will easily fit in your pocket whatever
you’re wearing, providing your peace of mind. Just place the earbud in the
capsule and it will be charged automatically –
so your Earity is ready any time you need it.


Your mobile phone makes you four times more likely to crash!!!At any given time during daylight hours, 660,000
drivers in the United States use cell phones, increasing the likelihood of
fatal crashes by 400%. Every 30 seconds an American gets in a car accident
related to distracted driving.Earity will significantly reduce the risk.
The tiny headphone sits comfortably in an ear 
and doesn’t create destruction. It notifies the wearer of an incoming
call by telling the name of the person calling. The user can answer the call or
ignore it.

By contributing to our project and help us get the
product to market, you will not only get a great product, but also great start of
a young company consisting of passionate and dedicated engineers with many
ideas and exciting visions. Please help us reduce the
number of traffic accidents and fatalities caused by cell phone use while
driving.
We plan to finish production in 60 days. All
design work is complete. Once we have the funds, orders will be placed so that
backers will have their rewards in just a few weeks.
Earity began in the
mind of founder and CEO, Maksym Vysochanskyy. His extensive work with scanning,
testing and printing led him to set up his own team to create the next
generation of earbuds. Our team includes experts from many different
disciplines: programmers, electronics engineers, marketers. industrial
designers and more.

<h3>Introducing Noodlebox</h3>
<p>Noodlebox is a <strong>four part sequencer </strong>for making electronic music. It has analog CV/Gate outputs for each part and supports MIDI.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1585764101/upxpkbhh2pnm2lscth1t.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Noodlebox has been designed to be </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Fun and intuitive </strong>– Edit your synth lines in the bright clear graphical LED matrix - just like using an Etch-a-Sketch - and tweak them live while they play.</li>
<li>
<strong>Great for jamming</strong> – Quickly loop and reverse sections of a sequence, jam with pitch transposition, crank crazy pitch randomness up and down then snap back to the original notes, incrementally add Euclidean gates... editing features common to many sequencers take on new creative and expressive meaning!</li>
<li>
<strong>Quick for live arranging</strong> – Capture variations of a pattern into four different 'pages' and arrange them to cycle automatically in any order, all while still jamming live and without missing a beat. Quickly save compositions to memory and recall them later.</li>
<li>
<strong>Powerful and flexible </strong>– Noodlebox is like having four step sequencers in one box, each with CV/Gate and MIDI output, and you can use it exactly like that. Or you can dive into the new possibilities opened up by the internal routing, cross-modulation and scaling of the four parts.</li>
<li>
<strong>Solid construction </strong>– Comes as standard with lovely, solid oak end cheeks (from <strong><a href=""https://www.synthsandwood.co.uk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Synths And Wood</a></strong>) and powder-coated, extruded aluminium side rails. Reassuringly weighty!</li>
<li>
<strong>No HP in the rack! </strong>– Why isn't Noodlebox a Eurorack module? Well, by staying on the desktop, it saves valuable space in your Eurorack setup, and you can move it around to where it's needed. Not to mention that a horizontal control surface is just so much more comfortable to use!</li>

<h3>The Story...</h3>
<p>My name is Jason and I have been making electronic music accessories for almost 8 years. Over that time I've been able to leave the day job behind and focus on making open-sourced kits and products for musicians. These include the <strong><a href=""https://six4pix.com/product/arpie/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Arpie </a></strong>arpeggiator, <a href=""https://six4pix.com/product/lestrum/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Le Strum</strong></a> MIDI controller, <strong><a href=""https://six4pix.com/product/bananasplit/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Banana Split</a> </strong>MIDI splitter, <a href=""https://six4pix.com/product/orangesqueeze/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Orange Squeeze</strong></a> MIDI merge and the <strong><a href=""https://six4pix.com/product/cvocd/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">CV.OCD</a> </strong>MIDI to CV converter. These products are all designed by me, assembled here in Brighton, UK with the occasional help of a couple of friends, and released under the <strong>Sixty Four Pixels</strong> brand name.</p>
<p>As a passionate musician myself, I have always wanted to make the type of <span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">products that I would use. </span><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">The idea of <strong>Noodlebox </strong>came about from experience playing with simple knob-based step sequencers such as the Korg SQ-1, and in particular some experiments I did with linking multiple SQ-1s together in interesting ways (setting different sequence lengths/clock divisions, adding pitch CVs, multiplexing between CV outputs, swapping gates between sequencers and so on). What got me most excited were the quirky grooves and melodies that emerged; unplanned but inspiring to build upon, tweak and refine.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Noodlebox is intended to bring that kind of fun experimentation and serendipitous workflow into a single compact device.

<ul></ul>
<h3>Features In Detail</h3>
<p>Noodlebox has <strong>four independent sequencer layers</strong>, each with a CV/Gate output. Each layer runs separately to the others (although staying in sync) and has its own step count, clock division etc. </p>
<p><strong>Each layer has four pages of up to 32 steps each</strong>. Pages can be used for A/B/C/D type pattern variations, for verse/chorus type song sections or chained to make a single pattern of up to 128 steps. You can cue up lists of pages for automatic cycling (up to 32 pages). Arranging pages is designed to be quick and easy to do creatively in a live setting.</p>
<p>Each step has a value range of 0-127 corresponding to row position of the data point in the scrolling window. This value corresponds to a chromatic or scale-forced note<strong> pitch CV</strong> (V/Oct or Hz/V output) or to a general purpose <strong>modulation CV</strong> (0 to 8V range). Freely mess with scaling modes during playback for microtonal weirdness!</p>
<p>User-entered CV points can be padded or interpolated into empty steps for fast creation of melodies and modulation slopes without the need to enter a value at every step. Voltage <strong>slew</strong> can be introduced between data points.</p>
<p>Gate points can easily be <strong>edited separately</strong> from CV points, so you can experiment with the rhythm of a fixed melody and vice-versa. The gate length (duty) is adjustable at layer level and any step can be “tied” to the next for legato play or rhythmic variation.</p>
<p>Gates can be set manually or by <strong>Euclidean algorithm</strong>. Each gate point can be assigned <strong>probability, retrigger/ratchet </strong>and<strong> accent</strong> (for MIDI velocity). Gate timing can be micro-offset for <strong>swing </strong>and <strong>slide</strong> effects, with or without randomness.</p>
<p>All layers can output <strong>MIDI notes </strong>or <strong>controller change (CC) messages</strong>, on shared or different MIDI channels. MIDI notes from an external keyboard can also be <strong>recorded</strong> and quantized into the grid while the sequence plays. Use Noodlebox as a <strong>MIDI looper</strong> just as intuitively as a guitar looper pedal.</p>
<p>Layers 2, 3, 4 can <strong>internally modulate</strong> the CV output of the previous layer by summing with it or overlaying it. This requires no special cable patching and can be used for <strong>automated transposition</strong> or adding simple variations to a sequence, right up to meandering <strong>microtonal craziness</strong>.</p>
<p>Editing features such as cloning and erasing data points, shifting patterns in pitch and timing, setting loop point and play direction, adding randomness (and taking it away again) are designed to be hands-on and creatively useful in a live setting.</p>
<p><strong>Eight memory slots </strong>store the whole of the Noodlebox session (all four layers). An auto save memory slot is used when shutting down using the OFF button, so that you can pick up where you left off when you turn it on again. A special memory slot can also be prepared as a “template” for new sessions to save commonly used settings.</p>

<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>We have been developing and refining Noodlebox for almost two years. When you support this campaign you are helping us to get over the last bump, which is the production run. </p>
<p>Noodlebox is our first crowdfunding campaign. We have decided to take this approach since the parts outlay for the production run is significantly higher than that of any previous product and we have found that we require additional funding for the PCB and surface mount fabrication.</p>
<p>At this time we have functional prototype units that are close to the final product. All product development to this point has been self-funded. While there are some final decisions to make around manufacturing, and some work to test the first release of the firmware, we're ready to begin production and present this campaign as a pre-order of a final product rather than the funding of product development.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What You Will Get</h3>
<p><strong>All perk levels for this campaign include a full Noodlebox product set from the first batch of units</strong>. This includes a quality <strong><a href=""https://myvolts.co.uk/product/38208/myVolts_power_supply:_9V_DC_500mA,_centre_negative_polarity,_5.5mm_/_2.1mm_tip"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">myVolts</a></strong> branded ""wall-wart"" power supply for your region (UK type, EU type or USA type) and a pair of MIDI breakout cables.</p>
<p>These will be shipped to you by an express courier service with tracking and a signature required (DHL or similar).</p>
<p>Depending on your perk level you may also receive a black, cotton Sixty Four Pixels logo T-shirt in your requested size and/or a set of <strong><a href=""https://shop.befaco.org/177-bananuts"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Befaco Banananuts </a></strong>(coloured custom nuts for 3.5mm sockets, original knurled socket nuts will also be included).  </p>
<p><strong>All perk levels have the same price, which is lower than our anticipated retail price. Banananuts and T-shirts are limited quantity free gifts - so get in there early, folks :) </strong></p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The Noodlebox hardware design is complete and we have ordered or received almost all of the components for the first production run; custom aluminium extrusions and wooden end cheeks have already been sourced from small companies in the UK. Other electronic and electrical components have been sourced from well-known suppliers including Mouser, Farnell, RS and Rapid. <strong>So this will happen!! </strong></p>
<p>However, the challenge right now is to predict exactly how long it will take, given the current coronavirus situation. The main tasks left to complete, and things that may impact them, are</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>PCB manufacturing </strong>(making the blank circuit board panels). This will be done by a Chinese factory which is currently operating normally. However there remains a risk of unexpected delays impacting the manufacturing or shipping of the boards back to the UK.</li>
<li>
<strong>PCB assembly </strong>(automated soldering of surface mount components to the circuit boards). Our Estonian contract manufacturer is currently open for orders although at a slightly reduced capacity. However there remains a risk of unexpected delays impacting the manufacturing or shipping of the boards back to the UK.</li>
<li>
<strong>Product assembly </strong>(soldering additional components to the circuit boards, testing the finished boards, assembling boards into the enclosures, programming firmware, final testing, calibration and packing for dispatch). These steps are taken in our workshop in the UK. A long extension of current social distancing measures due to coronavirus may extend this process as I may not be able to employ the friends who would usually assist me with this work.</li>
<li>
<strong>Finalise product firmware </strong>(testing, bug fixing, documentation). This work is being carried out in parallel with the above steps. I am doing this work myself, limiting possibility of unexpected delays (excepting illness etc).</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>The risks noted above are largely out of our control. However their impact will be to the timeline rather than whether production happens at all. </p>
<p>Our current anticipated timeline is that we'll have the assembled PCBs during May 2020 and be able to complete final product assembly during June. This timeline has us shipping units out during June or July 2020.</p>
<p>However we do ask you to be sure you accept that these timescales could be subject to change when you decide to support this campaign</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your interest and I hope you enjoy your Noodlebox!</p>

The production version is expected to be identical, although we might make some small changes (for example to the switch caps and the knob). Any display flickering visible on the video is an artifact of the camera and not visible during use.</i></p>

A long extension of current social distancing measures due to coronavirus may extend this process as I may not be able to employ the friends who would usually assist me with this work.

Finalise product firmware (testing, bug fixing, documentation). This work is being carried out in parallel with the above steps. I am doing this work myself, limiting possibility of unexpected delays (excepting illness etc).

 
The risks noted above are largely out of our control. However their impact will be to the timeline rather than whether production happens at all. 
Our current anticipated timeline is that we'll have the assembled PCBs during May 2020 and be able to complete final product assembly during June. This timeline has us shipping units out during June or July 2020.
However we do ask you to be sure you accept that these timescales could be subject to change when you decide to support this campaign
Thank you very much for your interest and I hope you enjoy your Noodlebox!

Please note that photos and video are of the final prototype. The production version is expected to be identical, although we might make some small changes (for example to the switch caps and the knob). Any display flickering visible on the video is an artifact of the camera and not visible during use.",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

Taking many of elements that have served other elite wireless earphones well, REECHO-EchoWeek can handle rigorous workouts while also tracking activity and playing music. Moreover, 7 vibrant colors, 48 hours of battery life, Bluetooth 5.0 and waterproof IPX6 make it a great choice in the burgeoning new “ hearables” marketplace.Balanced armature (BA) drivers are smaller than dynamic drivers, and because of their size, they are only available in in-ear monitor (IEM).They are known to be more expensive than dynamic driver counterparts.The driver consists of a miniature arm (armature) inside a coil of wire surrounded by two magnets. The top and bottom magnets determine the movement of the armature. When there is no net force on the armature, it means that it is at equal distance from both magnets, we say that it is “balanced”.REECHO-EchoWeek team innovatively adopted the world's smallest rounded balanced armature unit as the driver of earbuds, so there are some significant advantages: 1. Premium sound and superior sound-isolating effect. 2. Requires less power than a normal dynamic driver. 3. Small and lightweight (the balanced armature of REECHO-EchoWeek is only 0.16g, and single-sided earbuds is only 4.2g) Bluetooth 5.0 is the latest version of the Bluetooth wireless communication standard which means our EchoWeek can maintain a super stable wireless connection within 10m range and use with lower power consumption and higher speed. Combining a streamlined, ultra-comfortable fit with premium sound, EchoWeek earphones feature a lightweight design and enhanced Bluetooth performance not only for everyday use but passionate sports enthusiasts in pursuit of their limits.  Ordinary true wireless earphones are often too big to fit comfortably into your ear, even they fall off when you are exercising. In addition, when it comes to in-ear noise-isolating earphones, getting a tight seal is crucial to optimizing sound quality and bass performance. We managed to let different users get a perfect fit in different situations with 3 size of wingtips and eartips.

You simply connect the first STREAMR to your phone/laptop/tablet with Bluetooth like you would any other headset. And then the magic happens! The first STREAMR turns into, well, a streamer! And other STREAMRS around it pick up on the signal with the exact same audio without any delay.You're now ready to enjoy your favorite audio with your favorite people. Share a movie on a plane, start an impromptu silent disco in the subway with your friends or huddle around a Zoom call with crystal clear sound.  STREAMR works with any regular set of headphones if you've already got your favorites that you're not ready to part ways with. STREAMR's high-end Bluetooth chips and microphone give you crystal clear wireless audio, giving you perfect conference call audio on headphones that originally didn't even have a mic.We're also including a single earbud that's purposefully designed for STREAMR when you need to quickly answer a call or store it with one hand. Using a powerful, tiny magnet it clips onto your STREAMR so you always have your audio within reach. The magnetic earbud fits snug in your ear and the cable is optimized for a shorter length, making it a great tangle-free option to use during workouts.  If you want to pick up a phonecall hands-free, just give STREAMR a tap anywhere on the device, it's super simple.    We've searched high and low for the very best components because we want you to enjoy your STREAMR for years to come. We see our fair share of shoddily engineered Bluetooth ? and we don't want that. That's why we're using Qualcomm's aptX chipset, combined with an amp from Texas Instruments, it ain't cheap but it sounds great. A built-in rechargeable battery lets you use STREAMR for up to 10 hours at normal volume.Even though STREAMR comes in a tiny housing, it packs a punch. If you need low latency to blast through walls without delay in your sound, we've got a Pro-gamer edition for you! It's the same awesome STREAMR, but we've upgraded the Bluetooth chip to aptX-LL instead of aptX-HD.  The combination of low latency and endless multi-user audio is a first in gaming and it allows you to have gaming parties with a large group of friends, even when you're socially distancing. (It's depressing that we have to mention this, but yeah, keep that distance!)We've designed four beautiful colors, from deep black to rose gold for you to choose from. To keep things simple, you don't choose your color when you checkout on Kickstarter, but when we send you an email to ask for your address, you'll also be able to specify the colors you want to receive. Feel free to mix & match if you order a bunch, we know life isn't just black and white. The black & white colors are available on all reward tiers, the rose gold and forest green are available Family pack & up. All rewards come with our signature single-piece earbud with built-in magnets to make it snap back on STREAMR and accessories like charging cables and a manual.Since we've already successfully funded on Kickstarter before going to Indiegogo, we're looking to start manufacturing in August and start shipping out the first rewards in September!Hi!

<p>In rural Kenya, many workers at local health clinics are afraid to go home at night.  They fear not for their safety, but for the safety of their vaccines.</p>
<p class=""Normal1"">The problem is that electricity in these areas is often unreliable, and clinics lose power on a routine basis.  Once the power goes out, clinic refrigerators stop working and refrigerated vaccines and other medications start to go bad. Such breakdowns often happen at night or over the weekend without warning, leaving the vaccines inside to spoil and become ineffective.  Sometimes fridges malfunction and freeze the vaccines, destroying them. </p>
<p class=""Normal1"">Some clinics have gas-powered fridges or back-up generators, but fridges have to be manually switched over, and even these devices can develop mechanical failures or simply run out of gas.</p>
<p class=""Normal1"">As a result, clinic workers feel they have to keep constant watch over their medications.  For them, it is worth it because vaccines are one of the most effective medical interventions created, saving millions of children each year.  They dramatically reduce childhood mortality and increase the quality of life for children and their families.</p>
<p class=""Normal1"">Clinics want to make sure there are sufficient vaccines to treat their patients.  In fact, every year 25 million children – that’s 1 in 5 children born – do not receive these life-saving vaccinations. Often because the vaccines spoil or are wasted. </p>
<p class=""Normal1"">One low-cost and direct way of preventing vaccine waste is to give clinic workers in developing countries tools to ensure that vaccines are maintained at proper temperatures.</p>
<p class=""Normal1"">We are working with <a href=""http://medicmobile.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Medic Mobile</a> and <a href=""http://directrelief.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Direct Relief</a> to build invaluable collaborations with in-country Ministries of Health, and distribute ColdTrace devices to clinics in Kenya and Haiti. We are also working with <a href=""http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~rohitc/Home.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">University of Washington</a> to pilot Bluetooth devices to extend the reach of cold chain coverage. <strong><br/></strong></p>
<p class=""Normal1""><strong>WHAT IS COLDTRACE?</strong></p>
<p class=""Normal1"">ColdTrace is a new, low-cost temperature sensor that wirelessly connects with other ColdTrace units to create a global sensor network designed to keep vaccines safe on their journey to rural clinics in developing countries.</p>
<p class=""Normal1"">ColdTrace uses a cellphone to keep track of the temperature inside refrigerators where vaccines are stored and sends a text message alert to clinic managers when the temperatures are reaching dangerous limits. </p>
<p class=""Normal1"">The alert gives the managers a chance to either fix the refrigerator or move the vaccines to a safer location.</p>
<p class=""Normal1"">ColdTrace data is transmitted by every device in the network to a global database that helps health agencies, hospitals and clinics understand the weaknesses in their vaccine distribution systems and make better decisions that ensure life-saving treatments reach everyone.</p>
<p class=""Normal1"">After only one month using ColdTrace, all 8 clinics in Kenya that tested the device have said they would like to start paying for units.  This sentiment was echoed by the District Minister of Health, who has said he can partially fund a scale up of this device to every clinic in his area.  We would like to help him achieve this goal.</p>
<p class=""Normal1""><strong> </strong></p>
<p class=""Normal1""><strong>WHY IS COLDTRACE NEEDED? </strong></p>
<p class=""Normal1"">Millions of doses of vaccines are donated to developing countries annually by pharmaceutical companies, philanthropic aid organizations, and donor nations. </p>
<p class=""Normal1"">Many of them never reach the children that need them most. In too many instances, vaccines have to be discarded because they are not stored at the correct temperature.  A little too hot, or a little too cold, and the vaccine has to be thrown away.</p>
<p class=""Normal1"">Over 2.4 million children die each year as a result of vaccine-preventable diseases.</p>
<p class=""Normal1"">We believe that ColdTrace can be part of a solution to this problem by providing an affordable and easy-to-use way of ensuring that vaccines are kept at safe temperatures.</p>
<p class=""Normal1""><strong> </strong></p>
<p class=""Normal1""><strong>HOW DO VACCINES GO BAD?</strong></p>
<p class=""Normal1"">There are two main problems in current vaccine distribution systems in developing countries.</p>
<p class=""Normal1"">1.   <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Unreliable Infrastructure</span>:  In most developing countries, the infrastructure used to transport and store vaccines is old, electricity is unreliable, and backup power can be erratic.</p>
<p class=""Normal1"">Fridge failures are common, they are loosely monitored, and they often go unreported.</p>
<p class=""Normal1"">2.   <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">It’s Difficult to Identify Failures</span>:  Without monitoring, weaknesses in the distribution system are difficult to identify and fix in a systematic way.</p>
<p class=""Normal1"">As a result, vaccine wastage remains a persistent, unresolved problem.</p>
<p class=""Normal1""><strong> </strong></p>
<p class=""Normal1""><strong>WHAT ARE THE CURRENT SOLUTIONS?</strong></p>
<p class=""Normal1"">Currently, monitoring of vaccines relies on clinic workers looking at basic thermometer readings and recording them with pen and paper.</p>
<p class=""Normal1"">Because it is so labor intensive, this monitoring only happens at one point in the distribution chain, if at all.  This leaves many other points of potential failure without monitoring.</p>
<p class=""Normal1"">Also, pen and paper systems are prone to human error, and because they are not kept in electronic form, they are not easy to share with administrators or health agencies that could provide better management and oversight.</p>
<p class=""Normal1"">There are commercial temperature monitors available.  But they are either too expensive for widespread use in developing nations or they lack useful features such as wireless upload of data. </p>
<p class=""Normal1""><strong> </strong></p>
<p class=""Normal1""><strong>WHY IS COLDTRACE BETTER THAN THE ALTERNATIVES?  </strong></p>
<p class=""Normal1"">The ColdTrace project aims to construct a temperature sensor that costs less than $50 and that can provide real-time information on every step of the distribution chain, which can dramatically boost the effectiveness of vaccine distribution around the world.</p>
<p class=""Normal1"">ColdTrace aims to provide: </p>
<ul>
<li>Real-time remote monitoring of vaccines.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>SMS alerts about vaccines reaching critical temperatures.</li>
</ul><ul>

<li>A low-cost alternative to commercial systems.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>A globally available database of temperature data.</li>
</ul><p class=""Normal1""><strong> </strong></p>
<p class=""Normal1""><strong>HOW DOES COLDTRACE WORK?</strong></p>
<p class=""Normal1"">ColdTrace uses existing cellphone technologies in a new way to dramatically reduce the cost of wireless sensor data collection.  Unlike similar approaches, which employ microcontrollers or other costly components, ColdTrace takes advantage of the sophisticated electronics, battery and other features that already exist on the cellphone. </p>
<p>By building upon this standard technology, we can dramatically reduce the overall cost of the sensors and make it possible for almost any basic phone to serve as a wireless sensor.</p>
<p class=""Normal1"">This allows ColdTrace to bring remote monitoring to developing areas that have extremely low resources. </p>
<p class=""Normal1""><strong> </strong></p>
<p class=""Normal1""><strong>WHERE HAS COLDTRACE BEEN TESTED?</strong> </p>
<p class=""Normal1"">We have deployed ColdTrace prototypes in 8 clinics around Kilifi, Kenya, and in 8 facilities in Haiti.  These clinics serve the rural poor and often face extreme shortages of vital resources.</p>
<p class=""Normal1""><strong> </strong></p>
<p class=""Normal1""><strong>WHAT HAS COLDTRACE ACCOMPLISHED SO FAR?</strong></p>
<p class=""Normal1"">ColdTrace has already saved thousands of vaccines in Kenya during an early field test.</p>
<p class=""Normal1"">This occurred during a weekend when no clinic workers were present to check on the cold storage unit.  Upon receiving a ColdTrace alert about rising refrigerator temperatures, the clinic manager immediately came in and was able to fix the problem.  An alert received the very next day led to a more extensive analysis of the refrigerator and the discovery of a much larger problem.  The clinic manager credited ColdTrace with saving the entire lot of vaccines stored in her fridge. </p>
<p class=""Normal1"">As a result of this success, the clinics and the District Ministry of Health in Kilifi have committed funds and resources to continue using and scaling up ColdTrace.</p>
<p class=""Normal1""> </p>
<p class=""Normal1""><strong>WHAT IMPACT WILL MY CONTRIBUTION HAVE?</strong></p>
<p class=""Normal1"">Our goal is to build ColdTrace into a system that is an integral part of delivering life-saving vaccines to the 25 million children who do not receive them each year. </p>
<p class=""Normal1"">Your contribution will directly support up to 50 clinics in Kenya, and another 10 clinics in Ethiopia that want to receive the ColdTrace device.  These clinics will begin contributing data to the ColdTrace global database, and they will help us continue testing and refining the ColdTrace device for large-scale distribution.</p>
<p class=""Normal1"">Your contribution will help fund:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adapting our existing prototype device to be able to run on Kenyan cellphones that cost as little as $25 and to reduce its size and increase its portability.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Deploying 50 ColdTrace units in Kenyan clinics, in cooperation with the District Ministry of Health, for testing and troubleshooting.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Deploying 10 ColdTrace units in Ethiopian clinics.</li>

<p class=""Normal1"">We are so grateful for the opportunity to be working with local clinics, District Ministries of Health, NGOs, and organizations like the Pan American Health Organization (a regional office of the World Health Organization).  Your contribution will help move this project forward and will directly impact the health of many people on the ground. </p>

We can offer the same premium sound quality, durability and performance but at a price that everyone can afford.          After some serious number crunching and creative material allocations, we were able to mass-assemble custom component wireless earbuds at price point that allows us to not only beat competitor prices on similar products, but also support company growth.  To elaborate on what is meant by ‘creative material allocations’, in our early development stages we sent out several ROI’s to obtain manufacturing possibilities of Renobudz. Upon extensive communication with multiple factories, we were able to articulate and illustrate our final product objective to result in several orders of various prototype/sample components that would be cross-compatible, to function as wireless bluetooth stereo earbuds at a low cost.

hard cases. This allowed sound to be reflected and easily heard. In ZEROi’s case, we use a soft cloth material that absorbs leaking sound.B. Space was limited with other products. A buffer is needed around the bone conduction speaker to prevent any leakage of vibrations. Other products had a difficult time adding this aspect because the case was too small. ZEROi has enough room where the buffer is needed which absorbs the sound. 
 
 
 ZEROi is a hat with four built-in bone conduction speakers. With this technology, you can listen to music or make phone calls, without earphones, while being aware of your surroundings. ZEROi is water resistant, easy to use, and convenient on the go. 
 
 
    

 
     Bone conduction is a way of transmission of sound. Sound waves are transmitted at a frequency that can be conducted through the bones of the skull. ZEROi doesn’t block the outside sound, so it can used in normal environment conditions.         ZEROi has four bone conduction speakers, compared to only two from competitors, which allows for an enhance clarity of sound. ZEROi can be worn at any time of the day regardless of the weather condition or the setting. ZEROi allows you to have an open ear which lets you be aware of your surroundings. One charge can last up to 5 hours. Due to the different designs and colors ZEROi offers, it can be worn with any preferred outfit.                           The use of the high quality oil coating on the cotton makes cap look gorgeous. The material used makes it durable and water-resistant.      ZEROi can easily be worn anywhere at anytime! The possibilities are endless!    ZEROi can help you get to your next destination. With the Bluetooth option, use your favorite navigation app and listen to the directions. There is no need to look at your phone because the directions are being told to you.              
 
 
  With all the technology located in the bill of the cap, it only weighs 1oz (30g) more than your ordinary hat. It is so similar in weight you will not be able to feel the difference.",43.0,2,"4 Campaigns

<p><strong><em><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-5_71xP5dWCk/UJsGdUJTL3I/AAAAAAAAAC8/F_ZcZxmvkcs/s800/title-bar2.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Imagine</em></strong> listening to your favorite tunes while hanging out on the beach, relaxing in the pool, flying down the slopes or just walking down the street. The Vault is an easy-to-use case that quickly turns the amazing Jambox<strong>™</strong>, FoxL<strong>™</strong> and Braven SIX<strong>™</strong> Series speakers into extraordinary, portable music players. Not only do you get an extreme level of protection for your valuable speaker, our AudioClear vent technology delivers all of the sound you expect from your device. </p>

If you enjoy portable music, we definitely recommend that you check them out! Interested in a case for different device? Send us a message!</p>
<h2><strong>THE VAULT: Redefining Portable Music </strong></h2>
<p><br/></p>
<p>A revolutionary case system for Jambox<strong>™</strong>, FoxL<strong>™</strong> and Braven portable speakers that delivers the audio you expect while protecting your device from water, dirt, impact and more.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> <img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-I1cQ3TW1yeA/UJsGcNybgEI/AAAAAAAAAC0/4txkLNf-pr0/s800/Ruggedbar.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Rugged""/></p>
<p>The Vault is built from a tough polycarbonate case with our AudioClear technology incorporated into the lid. AudioClear is a barrier that effectively transmits the sound from your speaker while maintaining waterproof protection. The entire audio vent is covered by 20-gauge perforated steel, which not only protects against large impact but also prevents small objects from damaging the AudioClear surface (the holes of the grill are 1/16"" in diameter).</p>
<p>We chose to base The Vault on high-quality case from Pelican Products; a trusted waterproof case manufacturer. This particular Pelican case not only guarantees a tight waterproof seal but also features 3 attachment points for securing The Vault to almost anything.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The interior of The Vault is padded to protect your speaker from impact and hold it securely in place. To ensure that your speaker fits snugly and securely within The Vault, we have multiple configurations for the interior components.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><img alt=""Acoustic venting technology "" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-tfXt1XTBk1w/UJsDKwt6l0I/AAAAAAAAACE/eFvnNWwiIao/s800/audioclear-bar.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""AudioClear""/></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>AudioClear</strong> is the acoustic venting technology we developed to protect your speaker from water, dirt, sand, snow and much more, without limiting or degrading the sound you expect from your device. Unlike many waterproof audio vents found on cellphone cases and other portable electronics, AudioClear works extremely well to transmit the large volume of sound emitted from your portable speaker system. </p>
<h2>
<strong><br/>Why is the AudioClear vent important?</strong> </h2>
<p>We spent months developing and refining this technology for two reasons. One, we had to find a material that would be an excellent sound transmitter. Two, we had to find a material that would stand up to rugged use. The AudioClear vent features a very strong, durable and flexible membrane that can transmit a wide range of audio frequencies and maintain performance in varying operating temperatures and conditions.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Why would I want to support this project?</strong></h2>
<p><strong>If you love music or just new ideas</strong>, this is the project for you. Enabling people to ""Take Music Everywhere"" is our motto, and The Vault is our idea that enables an active, music friendly, lifestyle.</p>
<p><strong>If you already own a Jambox, FoxL, or Braven SIX</strong> series portable speaker, we hope the answer is obvious. Although some people may have only bought these<strong> portable</strong> devices to use as a desktop speaker, we are really targeting people that would like to play their music everywhere (and those of you that happen to damage your expensive belongings during everyday use). Whether you are heading to the pool, beach, mountains or just down the street, The Vault keeps your expensive portable speaker looking and sounding great.</p>
<p><strong>If you DO NOT already own a Jambox, FoxL or Braven SIX</strong> series portable speaker AND you really enjoy listening to music, we suggest that you check out one of these devices and protect it with our case. There are many options for portable speakers out there, but no system offers a truly waterproof design while also looking great in your office or on your kitchen table. The Vault allows you to combine great audio quality, battery life, Bluetooth capability and speakerphone functionality into a portable music player for <strong>ALL</strong> occasions.</p>
<p><strong>You like products that are MADE IN THE USA.</strong> Well, The Vault will be made in Atlanta, Georgia and most of it's components are made in various parts of the United States. We are not outsourcing production nor are we trying to lower costs by using cheap materials.</p>
<h2><strong>Why do we need your help?</strong></h2>
<p>We are ready to begin producing The Vault, but we need your help to get our feet off the ground. With your support we will buy raw materials in bulk which will help reduce the cost of The Vault to a sensible level. We also hope your support will help to validate our idea. Although everyone we know thinks this is a cool product, we need your help to make sure we get The Vault in front of the right people, especially current Jambox, FoxL and Braven owners. Please become a backer or, if nothing else, help us spread the word.</p>
<p>In addition to the points above, we would like to design an awesome bike mount to add another dimension of portability to The Vault. Developing new products is time consuming and possibly very expensive (think custom injection molding), so your funding would definitely help us achieve that goal.</p>
<h2><strong>How did it all start? </strong></h2>
<p>The Vault was first developed because there were no great ways to protect the Jambox when heading to the beach. We were able to quickly develop a prototype, but we soon realized that effectively transmitting sound through an element proof case was a much greater challenge. After dedicating months to research, development and testing, we were able to develop the AudioClear technology now featured in The Vault. Without AudioClear, The Vault would be a non-functional waterproof box.  </p>
<h2><strong>What is AudioActiv and who are ""we""?</strong></h2>
<p>My name is David Sanborn and AudioActiv is the company I started to help bring The Vault to the market. Right now, ""we"" are really just a small group of family and friends trying to make this project a success. Unfortunately, none of us have any experience in video creation so we are sorry for that less than professional video. The good news is that we spent much more of our time developing and testing our case.</p>
<p>If we are not able to answer all of your questions or you have feedback, please send us a message. All of your support is greatly appreciated. Check out our rewards, become a backer or, if nothing else, please spread the word about our project. </p>
<h2><strong>FAQ</strong></h2>
<p><strong>What speakers work inside in The Vault? </strong>The Vault has been designed to house Jawbone's original Jambox (not the BigJambox), Soundmatters' FoxL and all of Baven's SIX series (model 600, 625s, and 650).</p>
<p><strong>How do I use The Vault? </strong>It is best to power up the speaker, connect to your Bluetooth device, maximize the volume level (without music playing) and then secure the speaker inside The Vault. Use your Bluetooth connected device to adjust the volume level, play awesome music and maybe answer calls.</p>
<p><strong>Will my phone or other mp3 player fit inside The Vault?</strong>  Unfortunately no, not at this time. The Vault is intended for using your speaker with a Bluetooth connection. We are considering whether we can squeeze a small mp3 player into the case if used with the FoxL, but the challenge has been the location of the auxiliary input port and any problems a protruding wire may cause. </p>
<p><strong>What exactly does ""waterproof"" mean?</strong> We created The Vault to protect your portable speaker from accidental water contact during regular use. What that means is you should not take The Vault swimming, scuba diving or just let it float around in the pool all day (water resting on the AudioClear vent limits the amount of sound transmission anyway).

Imagine listening to your favorite tunes while hanging out on the beach, relaxing in the pool, flying down the slopes or just walking down the street. The Vault is an easy-to-use case that quickly turns the amazing Jambox™, FoxL™ and Braven SIX™ Series speakers into extraordinary, portable music players. Not only do you get an extreme level of protection for your valuable speaker, our AudioClear vent technology delivers all of the sound you expect from your device. 
Not familiar with the Jawbone Jambox, Soundmatters FoxL or Braven SIX Series speakers? If you enjoy portable music, we definitely recommend that you check them out! Interested in a case for different device? Send us a message!
THE VAULT: Redefining Portable Music 

A revolutionary case system for Jambox™, FoxL™ and Braven portable speakers that delivers the audio you expect while protecting your device from water, dirt, impact and more.
 
 
The Vault is built from a tough polycarbonate case with our AudioClear technology incorporated into the lid. AudioClear is a barrier that effectively transmits the sound from your speaker while maintaining waterproof protection. The entire audio vent is covered by 20-gauge perforated steel, which not only protects against large impact but also prevents small objects from damaging the AudioClear surface (the holes of the grill are 1/16"" in diameter).
We chose to base The Vault on high-quality case from Pelican Products; a trusted waterproof case manufacturer. This particular Pelican case not only guarantees a tight waterproof seal but also features 3 attachment points for securing The Vault to almost anything.

 
The interior of The Vault is padded to protect your speaker from impact and hold it securely in place. To ensure that your speaker fits snugly and securely within The Vault, we have multiple configurations for the interior components.
 

 
AudioClear is the acoustic venting technology we developed to protect your speaker from water, dirt, sand, snow and much more, without limiting or degrading the sound you expect from your device. Unlike many waterproof audio vents found on cellphone cases and other portable electronics, AudioClear works extremely well to transmit the large volume of sound emitted from your portable speaker system. 

Why is the AudioClear vent important? 
We spent months developing and refining this technology for two reasons. One, we had to find a material that would be an excellent sound transmitter. Two, we had to find a material that would stand up to rugged use. The AudioClear vent features a very strong, durable and flexible membrane that can transmit a wide range of audio frequencies and maintain performance in varying operating temperatures and conditions.
 
Why would I want to support this project?
If you love music or just new ideas, this is the project for you. Enabling people to ""Take Music Everywhere"" is our motto, and The Vault is our idea that enables an active, music friendly, lifestyle.
If you already own a Jambox, FoxL, or Braven SIX series portable speaker, we hope the answer is obvious. Although some people may have only bought these portable devices to use as a desktop speaker, we are really targeting people that would like to play their music everywhere (and those of you that happen to damage your expensive belongings during everyday use). Whether you are heading to the pool, beach, mountains or just down the street, The Vault keeps your expensive portable speaker looking and sounding great.
If you DO NOT already own a Jambox, FoxL or Braven SIX series portable speaker AND you really enjoy listening to music, we suggest that you check out one of these devices and protect it with our case. There are many options for portable speakers out there, but no system offers a truly waterproof design while also looking great in your office or on your kitchen table. The Vault allows you to combine great audio quality, battery life, Bluetooth capability and speakerphone functionality into a portable music player for ALL occasions.
You like products that are MADE IN THE USA. Well, The Vault will be made in Atlanta, Georgia and most of it's components are made in various parts of the United States. We are not outsourcing production nor are we trying to lower costs by using cheap materials.
Why do we need your help?
We are ready to begin producing The Vault, but we need your help to get our feet off the ground. With your support we will buy raw materials in bulk which will help reduce the cost of The Vault to a sensible level. We also hope your support will help to validate our idea. Although everyone we know thinks this is a cool product, we need your help to make sure we get The Vault in front of the right people, especially current Jambox, FoxL and Braven owners. Please become a backer or, if nothing else, help us spread the word.
In addition to the points above, we would like to design an awesome bike mount to add another dimension of portability to The Vault. Developing new products is time consuming and possibly very expensive (think custom injection molding), so your funding would definitely help us achieve that goal.
How did it all start? 
The Vault was first developed because there were no great ways to protect the Jambox when heading to the beach. We were able to quickly develop a prototype, but we soon realized that effectively transmitting sound through an element proof case was a much greater challenge. After dedicating months to research, development and testing, we were able to develop the AudioClear technology now featured in The Vault. Without AudioClear, The Vault would be a non-functional waterproof box.  
What is AudioActiv and who are ""we""?
My name is David Sanborn and AudioActiv is the company I started to help bring The Vault to the market. Right now, ""we"" are really just a small group of family and friends trying to make this project a success. Unfortunately, none of us have any experience in video creation so we are sorry for that less than professional video. The good news is that we spent much more of our time developing and testing our case.
If we are not able to answer all of your questions or you have feedback, please send us a message. All of your support is greatly appreciated. Check out our rewards, become a backer or, if nothing else, please spread the word about our project. 
FAQ
What speakers work inside in The Vault? The Vault has been designed to house Jawbone's original Jambox (not the BigJambox), Soundmatters' FoxL and all of Baven's SIX series (model 600, 625s, and 650).
How do I use The Vault? It is best to power up the speaker, connect to your Bluetooth device, maximize the volume level (without music playing) and then secure the speaker inside The Vault. Use your Bluetooth connected device to adjust the volume level, play awesome music and maybe answer calls.
Will my phone or other mp3 player fit inside The Vault?  Unfortunately no, not at this time. The Vault is intended for using your speaker with a Bluetooth connection. We are considering whether we can squeeze a small mp3 player into the case if used with the FoxL, but the challenge has been the location of the auxiliary input port and any problems a protruding wire may cause. 
What exactly does ""waterproof"" mean? We created The Vault to protect your portable speaker from accidental water contact during regular use. What that means is you should not take The Vault swimming, scuba diving or just let it float around in the pool all day (water resting on the AudioClear vent limits the amount of sound transmission anyway). Furthermore, your case IS waterproof when submerged to a shallow depth, but that submersion should only occur if it accidentally falls into the water or you flip over your kayak.
When will I get to choose my grill color or custom grill option? When funding is complete, we will send emails to all supporters to determine your choice for either the custom grill or the black, red, blue or yellow grill reward option. The easiest way for us to show you your options for the custom grill is to have you visit the following links (options shown below paint types): 1 , 2 ,3 , 4 , 5 , 6.
The paint colors/textures you see are examples of the heavy-duty enamels we can purchase or at least match.

It does this by using the surface to act as a “cone”: the surface diffuses the sound.  This means the Cisor is able to provide a full audible frequency range down to as low as 30hz giving seriously deep bass and as high as 15khz which is high enough to reproduce sounds made by orchestral instruments.  Different surfaces (or substrates) have different resonating properties, so audio will sound slightly different depending upon the surface it is placed upon.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1480115993/l3azhbjy81gzezqt3ud7.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">The frequency and range of traditional speakers directly depends upon the size of the cone as well as the driver, hence why many small portable speakers sound “tinny”.  They cannot offer both deep bass and higher frequency because the driver can only deliver certain frequency ranges.  It is why many HiFi systems have separate subwoofers for low frequencies (bass). Overtime, a traditional speaker will lose amplification capabilities due to wear of the cone.  Even worse can happen if the cone tears; the speaker becomes inaudible.  </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0803/7239/files/2Gif-Cisor-How-it-work.gif?8929205148915848186"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">Because Damson has been able to push the capabilities of the sound it means that there is no need for different speakers to provide vocals/acoustics and bass. A traditional speaker has a coil that is fixed to the permanent magnet (often referred to as the driver). Damson’s Incisor Diffusion Technology has replaced the coil with “teeth” (incisors). These act in the same way as a coil; they power the different frequencies that are pushed down the leg through to the surface. Due to the way the Incisor Diffusion Technology™ reacts with the surface, it allows the sound to transfer through it. Place one of our speakers on a window and the sound is diffused through the glass and can be heard on both sides.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1480284991/x8xk9xi8tcuv0cquezfw.jpg"" src=""""/><br/> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-pin-nopin=""true"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1480030649/nli0qu1szqgxcgmfzxsz.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-pin-nopin=""true"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1480062574/ikj3j0qhma8sp86ytdlk.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">With it's cool design and fun feature, you'd be forgiven for thinking that Cisor is another gimmick.

 Tell your friends and family about our Cisor Indiegogo page and if they pick one of our great Cisor perks - you get $5 (with no limit!). The question is how?A Successful Referral gets you a $5 refund on your Indiegogo perk, further referral gifts will be sent to you via paypal at the end of the campaign. Speakers. There's loads of them, right? What can Cisor offer that no other can?Cisor sets itself apart from the rest by producing acoustics unique to each environment and surface. Each surface has different sound qualities to the next, meaning there's no limit to the fun you can have experimenting and finding out which sound does it for you. It gets better - the bigger the surface, the bigger the sound.

 
Traditional speakers use a cone to convert sound waves into the sounds we hear. Cisor has done away with the traditional cone. This has allowed us to create a bigger and far more powerful driver than you would ordinarily be able to fit inside a speaker that's as small as this one.Incisor diffusion technology™ has removed the need for a cone. It does this by using the surface to act as a “cone”: the surface diffuses the sound.  This means the Cisor is able to provide a full audible frequency range down to as low as 30hz giving seriously deep bass and as high as 15khz which is high enough to reproduce sounds made by orchestral instruments.  Different surfaces (or substrates) have different resonating properties, so audio will sound slightly different depending upon the surface it is placed upon.The frequency and range of traditional speakers directly depends upon the size of the cone as well as the driver, hence why many small portable speakers sound “tinny”.  They cannot offer both deep bass and higher frequency because the driver can only deliver certain frequency ranges.  It is why many HiFi systems have separate subwoofers for low frequencies (bass). Overtime, a traditional speaker will lose amplification capabilities due to wear of the cone.  Even worse can happen if the cone tears; the speaker becomes inaudible.  Because Damson has been able to push the capabilities of the sound it means that there is no need for different speakers to provide vocals/acoustics and bass. A traditional speaker has a coil that is fixed to the permanent magnet (often referred to as the driver). Damson’s Incisor Diffusion Technology has replaced the coil with “teeth” (incisors). These act in the same way as a coil; they power the different frequencies that are pushed down the leg through to the surface. Due to the way the Incisor Diffusion Technology™ reacts with the surface, it allows the sound to transfer through it. Place one of our speakers on a window and the sound is diffused through the glass and can be heard on both sides. With it's cool design and fun feature, you'd be forgiven for thinking that Cisor is another gimmick. It's not. Cisor is crammed full of the latest technology and uses Damson's innovative ""Incisor Diffusion Technology"", which has been precision-engineered to deliver amazing sound from a speaker that is small enough to be held in the palm of your hand.Perfect portable sound small yet powerful.Whether relaxing over a coffee, watching a movie or even a sports game Cisor will become the perfect companion for how you listen to your audio.Fix the Cisor and Metal Mount on rear window and you'll turn the entire vehicle into a speaker. Fix Cisor and Metal Mount to a window and you'll hear sound on both sides.Perfect for summer parties. Not content with producing the most dynamic sound from a single speaker, we pushed the boundaries further to enable Cisor to work in wireless stereo. Bring two Cisors together and with a brief setup you will be streaming music in flawless, wireless stereo. Each Cisor can be set to a maximum of 10m (30') apart.The result is phenomenal, with two tiny speakers able to fill a room of at least 500 sqft (42 sqm). Finally you'll be able to listen to music, in stereo, in your living room without having to resort to big (and, lets face it, ugly) speaker systems. You no longer need to compromise on style, or take up valuable space. Just select whichever you want from the perks in the right hand side.  Cisor looks and feels amazing. It's as simple as that. Beautifully crafted from anodised aluminium and available in silver or black design.Your Cisor will add style wherever you decide to set it down.Have you ever been to a party where there's music inside, but not a lot going on outside, or vice versa? We all know that at parties people tend to congregate in certain areas, be it the living room, or outside in the yard, garden or balcony. Cisor has the solution - the Metal Mount. Simply screw the Cisor securely into place using the threaded base and fix the Metal Mount to a window inside. Turn it on, go outside. Yep, sound on both sides. All of a sudden, a speaker the size of a soda can is now capable of filling not only the inside of your place, but it's also streaming high quality audio outside.The mount isn't limited to external windows. Maybe you want a speaker that you can listen to in the shower or bath, but why should you sacrifice the sound quality that goes hand in hand with water resistant speakers. Just place Cisor in the Metal Mount and fix onto the Shower screen (outside!) and you've got the greatest shower speaker ever!Fancy a tailgate party? No problem, put Cisor in the Metal Mount and fix it to the car window, or even on top of the car, and be the envy of everyone else (our serious research shows that trucks sound amazing!).  SIZE (HxØ):                         2.7˝ x 2.3˝  | 78mm x 58mmWEIGHT:                               11.3oz /  320gMATERIAL:                          Anodised Aluminium.
