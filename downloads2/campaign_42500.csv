All of our styles, fabrics, colors, and classic prints were chosen with these goddesses in mind.
The collection is a true reflection of classic beauty with a modern edge...our view of Hawaii as it is today. Shot with the island of Maui as the perfect backdrop, the campaign tells the story of the modern goddess in all of us. We are proud to present The Moons Of Haumea and hope you love it!

Risks & Challenges

We have spent the last year and a half refining our swimwear designs and patterns so that we could take most of the risk out of the manufacturing process. Our styles have been fit tested on body types of all kinds... professional fit models, professional athletes, and of course all of our beautiful friends and family members. The jury is in and our fit is more than approved!

We have also solved production and sourcing issues working both domestically in Los Angeles and internationally on the beautiful island of Bali. Our fabric vendors are secured and provide us with the best qualities in the market today.
We are excited to run this campaign and bring House Of Tomorrow 2016 to our backers...Let the games begin!

<h1>HEADLINES</h1>
</div><h3><b><br/></b></h3><h3><b>1. You WILL still receive your products if our goal is not reached so don't hesitate to buy today!</b></h3><div><b><br/></b></div><h3><b>2. Thin Ice is so cool that Adam Paulin, the Founder, was invited to pitch Thin Ice on CBC's Dragons' Den for their 10th Season!</b></h3><h2><br/></h2><h3>3. Thin Ice is donating 5% of ALL Indiegogo funding to feeding starving children around the world. Help us balance the global scale by feeding the hungry as you lean out.</h3><div><br/></div><h3><br/></h3><h1>THE STORY</h1><div><br/></div><h3><b>How the metabolic hack works</b></h3>
<p>
</p><p>Did you know you can trick your body into thinking it’s in a colder environment than it actually is by stimulating specific regions with cold temperatures? This creates a cascade of responses in your body that kick your metabolism into overdrive, This let's you burn unwanted fat and get leaner, all while letting your body do the work for you!</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1435016296/an2ikjyz0q2pesrriaub.gif"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><h3><b>Wait, won’t I feel cold?</b></h3>
<p>
</p><p>Don’t worry, this stimulation is so mild you’ll forget all about it after just a few seconds of adaptation. The same concept is at play every time you wade into a pool. You feel cold for a few seconds and then the sensation vanishes. The pool doesn’t warm up, it’s your body that warms up from within to counteract its new environment. Besides, if you do feel the chill you can always adjust the temperature of your Thin Ice clothing to accommodate your comfort level. At Thin Ice, we want to have a long-term weight-loss management relationship with you. It's not in our best interest to scare you away by making you uncomfortably cold!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><h3><b>How Does Thin Ice Clothing Harness the Metabolism Hack? </b></h3>
<p>
</p><p>The Thin Ice insole and vest target regions of your body with high concentrations of thermoreceptors. These neural receptors alert your body to the presence of cold, triggering a metabolic response that generates heat in your core. </p>
<p>
</p><p>As the core’s blood warms, it then must be pumped all the way to the extremities where the cold influence is being felt. The best part of this process is that your body does all this calorie-expensive work automatically without you even having to think about it. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1435016380/te1ca1ze0ivjsf2wq3ky.gif"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>The tissue pathway responsible for this heat generation is called the Brown Adipose Tissue (BAT) pathway and it basically functions as your body’s internal thermostat. Even in room temperature, roughly 50% of your daily calories are burnt for no other reason than to keep your body at a comfortable temperature. </p><p>Notice that you don’t undergo shivering in room temperature. This is because the BAT-pathway is completely different than the shivering mechanism. Thin Ice stimulates BAT and will <b><i>not</i> </b>make you shiver. This allows Thin Ice’s patent-pending weight-loss technology to help you burn excess calories while being hidden discretely in clothing and apparel items.</p>
<p>

</p><h3><b><h3><span>So how do we know this works?</span></h3></b></h3><p>Thin Ice products might sound too good to be true, but we are proud to say that their underlying concept is based on decades of rigorous peer-reviewed scientific study. </p><p>Here are some respected journals and their published findings on the subject:</p><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/PzFxcmijpvVghIjzTCjVK4yvVXSO5IfH1KkyyrqvUrvBksZ4tt3HTCrTfyP9eQIJYYNxaBBMFYIE_mz6l4lY65KfpuntRsIw93tSCvUVzycJPSg6FZQAeCMxyTXMqlA7qyJlwD4"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><a href=""http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/supercharging-brown-fat-to-battle-obesity/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/supercharging-brown-fat-to-battle-obesity/</a></p><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/vPRVNkJcKYpRJ42w5m-0W3-P3JVUcXHXmGwk3nCAhs2x2njetNHK82nUriazc457vECbHtcXSyMoS-rMon4c8SzQAUr8xd2F4VLQmMuoXhtcodDqdmrMzYy3lAlpm8fd8ncMVL0"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><a href=""http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa0808718"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa0808718</a></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/lDZXXRO_NO5RlfQtiVIpqGXkk-Ya1VX_kse6RZjfntb90Kvi0cQQY9lhECDaSljwkA6UpaisLdyUaukwI8n7zAmiCmHdD4ojZc8xSbR7dMhB1a2WOyy5MXip0objmQbLyUPVLT0"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><a href=""http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/abs/10.1139/y78-015#.VU9x-NpViko"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/abs/10.1139/y78-015#.VU9x-NpViko</a></p><br/><p>Besides the scientific articles on the subject matter there are also a plethora of anecdotal examples of the same temperature-related weight-loss effects at play. One of the most salient examples is that of Michael Phelps' diet as he trained for the Beijing Olympics. During that time he ate the 12,000 calories seen below on a daily basis:</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436416111/mqb9zjbj60amlvhrydrk.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 388.716186252772px; height: 453px;""/></p><p><br/></p><p>Phelps was able to eat all of that (6 times more than the average person) while staying ripped. Only about half this calorie intake is explainable by his exercise regime and basal metabolic rate. The thousands of missing calories are accounted for by considering Phelps trained in a pool as opposed to land for 4 hours a day. Water is 14 times more thermally conductive than air is. This means heat was leaving Phelps' body much faster than it would have if he was on land leading to massive calorie burning to create heat to keep him warm. This is the exact same process that is at play with Thin Ice products, albeit without the sogginess!</p><p>This weight-loss method has been hiding in plain sight throughout our struggles and failed weight-loss attempts. Don't let it sneak away again!</p><p>If you are keen to embrace your inner nerd, there is more science we are happy to share with you. Check out the FAQ, and, if you don’t find the information you’re looking for, just ask us!</p><br/><h3><b>Hold on, can’t I just turn down my thermostat?</b></h3>
<p>
</p><p>You can! In fact, many doctors recommend that you should add this to your weight-loss regimes. <b>However,</b> you can’t bring a cold room with you everywhere you go, nor would you want to as cold rooms can cause us to shiver. Imagine how popular you’d be if you tried to keep the entire office cold. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The brilliant part of the Thin Ice system is that the entire foot/torso doesn’t need to be kept cold, but only strategically chosen areas covered by the cooling chips. This selective targeting means less discomfort while maintaining maximal metabolic response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best of all, the cooling you experience is totally adjustable to suit your comfort levels through your smart device. This effect will also persist for as long as you want - at the times you want - anywhere you go. So, yes you can turn down your thermostat but remember there’s no need to shiver at home to lose weight. Thin Ice has your back (and feet).</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><h3><b>What comprises Thin Ice Technology?</b></h3>
<p>
</p><p>Thin Ice technology uses specialized Peltier cooling chips to chill specific areas of the body. Peltier chips are also found in other technologies with compact cooling requirements such as microprocessors and various electronics. They essentially act as heat pumps, forcing heat to one side and leaving the other side cool. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1435016426/jdyc5u1jhdakph6qzywe.gif"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>These chips are powered by an unobtrusive battery that's located under the arch that simultaneously helps to provide arch support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The warmed sides of the Peltier chips are located on the bottom of the insole. The warmth generated by the Peltier mechanism can be dissipated through a variety of heat sink materials. There are also technologies that are able to capture heat and convert heat into electricity that are currently being explored by our engineering team. The Thin Ice engineering team is currently hard at work making sure the best possible heat dissipation/capturing mechanisms are combined in the final prototype for maximal comfort and battery efficiency. Hey, that reminds me, meet our engineering team!</p>

</p><p>Thin Ice also worked with a student engineering team from <b>George Brown College</b> on a contract dedicated specifically to exploring mechanism to increase battery life through connect mechanisms and for dissipating the warmth produced by the base of the Peltier chips.</p><p>Finally, Thin Ice has project in the works at York University in Toronto through their Innovation York program including 2 engineering specialist professors. The project is in the final stages of its review process. These professors would be exploring the optimal materials to maximize the effectiveness of Thin Ice products.<br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1435016505/optwgcyqanmvyjehkyyh.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

</p><h3><b>The Thin Ice Story</b></h3>
<p>
</p><p>Thin Ice was created by personal trainer, former NCAA Athlete, University of Toronto Alumni in Neuroscience and Psychology, Adam Paulin, who is passionate about fitness and human performance. Here is his description of his journey:</p>
<p>
</p><p>“I’ve spent a lot of time asking myself how we can hack our bodies into optimal performance using science. There is a certain satisfaction in making your body do your bidding"".</p>
<p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1435016858/ujo5ijadwtt7ynpnj36j.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>In Tim Ferris's revolutionary book, the 4-Hour Body - which everyone should <a href=""http://fourhourbody.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>check out</span></a> - he talks extensively about cold temperatures and their weight-loss effects. I wondered why no one had harnessed this method in product form. There had to be a way to make using cold temperatures for weight-loss more convenient without having to suffer through 20 minutes of hell in an ice bath.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What stood out the most in the book was Tim’s comparison of the effects of ice baths versus stimulation using ice packs. What Tim demonstrated is that simply wearing an ice pack on certain parts of the neck you could expect to see 60% of the weight-loss effects as a 20 minute (torture-worthy) ice bath. Using a method you could implement thoughtlessly while watching <i>Friends</i>, you could see a big portion of the results you would achieve shivering away your calories for 20 minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>As a personal trainer at the time, I began to see the biggest factor stopping people from achieving an effective weight-loss regime. Clients would come up with every excuse under the sun to skip a session, but it really came down to one thing: going to the gym was not convenient. I knew this ice pack hack was the way to go, but was distracted from considering the matter further until I finished my studies at the University of Toronto. When I was done with my undergrad I knew I wanted to take at least one year off before braving med school applications so I did the only logical thing: I started inventing products.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1435016904/qc5gfie4okaghtql0sbj.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>This is when I remembered the potential of harnessing the cold temperatures to induce weight-loss. The Thin Ice shoe (the precursor to the Thin Ice insole) came to me quite early but I didn’t see its true potential right away. When I started telling people I was inevitably met with the same look of shock and amazement. “So, what you’re saying is I can lose weight all day and night just by wearing an insole?”. “Yes you can!”, I’d say. I started to realize I had something on my hands worth pursuing, so I learned to be an entrepreneur through many trials and errors, and benefitted from the mentorship of some of the greatest minds I’ve had the privilege to meet. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I assembled an amazing team and the idea started to materialize. We now have a proof of concept prototype and a pitch in front of the <b>CBC's Dragons </b>under our belt, </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1435632340/sv9px3ouxudz9t6xxwzn.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p>Dragons' Den was a surreal experience. Imagine walking down echoing stairs into the pitch black den only to be confronted with five rich investment giants when the lights are abruptly flicked on. You just have to remember you're one of the few people who will ever get this opportunity and continue with your pitch! I've sworn secrecy of the results of our appearance until the end of the next season but hopefully you'll be able to me on the show next fall or winter!""</p><p></p><h3><b>What will we do with $50,000?</b></h3><p>This is the minimum amount we need when combined with our other sources of financing to develop the product, perform any required modifications, manufacture it and ship it to our backers. </p><p>By helping us get this very valuable funding and voting with your feet, we can put all the pieces of the puzzle together and provide you with your very own Thin Ice system.</p><p><b style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;"">Why you should support us</b><br/></p><p>We really think that this product will be a disruptive force in the weight-loss industry. A revolution in convenience, effectiveness and design. We have built several prototype devices and would love to have you be on the front lines with us getting this product to the masses.  That's why were are currently offering <b>35-50% OFF </b>the projected retail price of our products.  Its our way of saying thank you for supporting us in our infancy.</p><p>Here are several reasons why more financing is a better thing for you as a backer:</p><ul>
<li>It will allow us finish development and get you the product faster.</li>
<li>It will allow us to run trials that help to quantify the results of the product so we can add standardized results to the app. This will let you know how many calories you’re losing using Thin Ice technology on a second-to-second basis!</li>
<li>It will allow us to start aggressively marketing our brand globally so we can alert people around the world of our new approach to weight-loss and help them to join the movement.</li>
</ul><p>There are a bunch of discrete milestones we hope we can reach with you and we’ll be sure to keep you updated on which ones we’re approaching next! There will also be something new and exciting we can do with the brand with additional funding.</p><h3>Another great reason to support this campaign</h3><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>We will match 5% of all funds raised on Indiegogo with the direct purchase of food that we will send to hungry children around the world. </b></p>We have partnered up with RTG group to make this carry out this task. Together we can balance the global scale of malnourished by leaning out the overfed and feeding the hungry. Every 6 seconds a child dies from malnutrition. Help us re-calibrate that clock, one child at a time while simultaneously investing in your own health. There is a reason ""RTG"" stands for ""Receiving Through Giving"".<br/><p><br/></p>

</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><h3><b>FAQ</b></h3>
<p>
</p><h4>
<b>Where do we ship?</b> </h4>
<p>Shipping is available WORLDWIDE and is automatically calculated based on the country you select in the purchasing process. Shipping to Canada and US is 10 USD and shipping internationally is 49 USD.</p>
<p>
</p><h4><b>When should I ideally use the Thin Ice Vest? </b></h4>
<p>The vest is light and comfortable enough to be slept in and versatile enough to wear under common clothing. It is sleeveless so you can wear it with a variety of outfits. The vest can also be worn safely to bed where you can burn significant calories while you are fast asleep. </p>
<p>
</p><h4><b>When should I ideally use the Thin Ice Insole? </b></h4>
<p>The insole is most effective when walking, sitting, commuting, working at a desk, lounging and generally going about your day. The insole can be worn in almost all footwear, including open toe shoes so you can even be burning fat during a night on the town.</p>
<p>
</p><h4>
<b>What is the warranty?</b><br/>
</h4>
<p>We offer a 1 year warranty on the mechanical parts. The layer of the product that touches the skin is replaceable however, so you can buy those parts to keep the vest or insole looking and feeling (and smelling) like new. </p>
<p>
</p><h3><b>Technical FAQ</b></h3>
<p>
</p><h4><b>How do I charge the insole/vest? </b></h4>
<p>The insole and vest will be fully rechargeable using a charging pad which will be included with the product.  </p>
<p>
</p><h4><b>Does it work with iOS and Android Devices?  </b></h4>
<p>Yes, the app will be available for iOS and Android.</p>
<p>
</p><h4>
<b>How long does the battery last</b><b>?  </b>
</h4>
<p>Around 4-8 hours for the insole, 6-8 for the vest. This may change depending on how much juice we can squeeze out of the kinetic mechanism. Remember, the more you walk the longer the insole battery will last. Walking more never hurt anybody in the weight-loss department either :)</p>
<p>
</p><h4>
<b>How long does the battery take to charge</b><b>?  </b>
</h4>
<p>Around two hours from a fully discharged state.</p>
<p>
</p><h4><b>What temperature range does it work with?</b></h4>
<p>The temperature ranges from very mild to relatively intense. We are still streamlining the exact, optimal range to have you losing the most fat with the most possible comfort.</p>
<p>
</p><h4><b>How safe is the insole for weight bearing?</b></h4>
<p>You can safely wear the insole during low intensity activities like walking, lounging, commuting, working at your desk and doing everyday things. We recommend avoiding weight bearing exercises such as weight lifting, running, or any high impact sports. The vest is a good alternative for weight bearing activities that put pressure on the feet such as jogging.</p>
<p>
</p><h4><b>What is the recommended length of use for the insole/vest?</b></h4>
<p>As long as you feel comfortable with. If you experience any discomfort adjust settings using your smart device.  </p>
<p>
</p><h4><b>How do you wash the product?</b></h4>
<p>For everyday cleaning it is recommended to use an antibiotic wipe. If the material that touches the skin becomes too worn out you can replace just that layer. The rest of the vest or insole is totally reusable and doesn’t need to be replaced.</p>
<p>
</p><h3><b>Other FAQ</b></h3>
<p>
</p><h4><b>Can I get the insole/vest in my size? </b></h4>
<p>Yes, the insoles come in the standard range of shoes sizes, women’s 6-10, and men’s 8-12. The vests come in sizes ranging from S-XXL for both men and women. If you ask us we can probably also accommodate child sizes. After all, little Jimmy can't run 5K while he's playing video games but he can lose weight wearing Thin Ice.</p>
<p>
</p><h4><b>Who did your movie? </b></h4>
<p>Our movie was put together by us! If you enjoyed the video and want us to help you create your own please refer to the applicable perk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The service includes 1.) a consultation session or two to flush out your idea and help craft the script. 2.) The organization of a day long shoot where in we arrange for a videographer to record you talking about your product, filming some b-roll and product demos, and 3.) professional editing, graphics, music and sound mixing. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Depending on your location, the organization of the shoot will require some negotiation. So please talk to us! We’re a friendly bunch.</p>
<p>
</p><h4><b>Can I change or cancel my perk?</b></h4>
<p>Indiegogo policy dictates that campaign owners have no ability to adjust perk selections. That means we cannot upgrade your perk, we cannot change your perk and we cannot cancel your perk. Please note that contributions made on Indiegogo are also non-refundable.</p>
<p>
</p><h4><b>How do I get the Early Bird pricing?</b></h4>
<p>You’ll have to hurry as we only offer a limited quantity (20) of Thin Ice products at such a ridiculously low price. What do you want from us!? We're already giving you 35% off for the campaign's set price!</p>
<p>
</p><h4><b>Does the Thin Ice apparel offer different colour choices?</b></h4>
<p>As Henry Ford was fond of saying, “You can choose any colour you’d like - as long as it’s black.” The clothing and insoles are black, but since they will most likely be hidden underneath your clothing, it won’t affect your fashion. However, if we receive a certain amount of requests for a specific colour through support, we’d be more than happy to accommodate those requests. Please feel free to share your ideas.</p>
<p>
</p><h4><b>Will people with chronic diseases be able to use the product?</b></h4>
<p>People with poor circulation or diabetes should consult their physician before using the products. This product does not cure any chronic conditions.</p>

Did you know you can trick your body into thinking it’s in a colder environment than it actually is by stimulating specific regions with cold temperatures? This creates a cascade of responses in your body that kick your metabolism into overdrive, This let's you burn unwanted fat and get leaner, all while letting your body do the work for you!




Wait, won’t I feel cold?

Don’t worry, this stimulation is so mild you’ll forget all about it after just a few seconds of adaptation. The same concept is at play every time you wade into a pool. You feel cold for a few seconds and then the sensation vanishes. The pool doesn’t warm up, it’s your body that warms up from within to counteract its new environment. Besides, if you do feel the chill you can always adjust the temperature of your Thin Ice clothing to accommodate your comfort level. At Thin Ice, we want to have a long-term weight-loss management relationship with you. It's not in our best interest to scare you away by making you uncomfortably cold!


How Does Thin Ice Clothing Harness the Metabolism Hack? 

The Thin Ice insole and vest target regions of your body with high concentrations of thermoreceptors. These neural receptors alert your body to the presence of cold, triggering a metabolic response that generates heat in your core. 

As the core’s blood warms, it then must be pumped all the way to the extremities where the cold influence is being felt. The best part of this process is that your body does all this calorie-expensive work automatically without you even having to think about it. The tissue pathway responsible for this heat generation is called the Brown Adipose Tissue (BAT) pathway and it basically functions as your body’s internal thermostat. Even in room temperature, roughly 50% of your daily calories are burnt for no other reason than to keep your body at a comfortable temperature. Notice that you don’t undergo shivering in room temperature. This is because the BAT-pathway is completely different than the shivering mechanism. Thin Ice stimulates BAT and will not make you shiver. This allows Thin Ice’s patent-pending weight-loss technology to help you burn excess calories while being hidden discretely in clothing and apparel items.


So how do we know this works?Thin Ice products might sound too good to be true, but we are proud to say that their underlying concept is based on decades of rigorous peer-reviewed scientific study. Here are some respected journals and their published findings on the subject:http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/supercharging-brown-fat-to-battle-obesity/http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa0808718http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/abs/10.1139/y78-015#.VU9x-NpVikoBesides the scientific articles on the subject matter there are also a plethora of anecdotal examples of the same temperature-related weight-loss effects at play. One of the most salient examples is that of Michael Phelps' diet as he trained for the Beijing Olympics. During that time he ate the 12,000 calories seen below on a daily basis:Phelps was able to eat all of that (6 times more than the average person) while staying ripped. Only about half this calorie intake is explainable by his exercise regime and basal metabolic rate. The thousands of missing calories are accounted for by considering Phelps trained in a pool as opposed to land for 4 hours a day. Water is 14 times more thermally conductive than air is. This means heat was leaving Phelps' body much faster than it would have if he was on land leading to massive calorie burning to create heat to keep him warm. This is the exact same process that is at play with Thin Ice products, albeit without the sogginess!This weight-loss method has been hiding in plain sight throughout our struggles and failed weight-loss attempts. Don't let it sneak away again!If you are keen to embrace your inner nerd, there is more science we are happy to share with you. Check out the FAQ, and, if you don’t find the information you’re looking for, just ask us!Hold on, can’t I just turn down my thermostat?

You can! In fact, many doctors recommend that you should add this to your weight-loss regimes. However, you can’t bring a cold room with you everywhere you go, nor would you want to as cold rooms can cause us to shiver. Imagine how popular you’d be if you tried to keep the entire office cold. 

The brilliant part of the Thin Ice system is that the entire foot/torso doesn’t need to be kept cold, but only strategically chosen areas covered by the cooling chips. This selective targeting means less discomfort while maintaining maximal metabolic response.

Best of all, the cooling you experience is totally adjustable to suit your comfort levels through your smart device. This effect will also persist for as long as you want - at the times you want - anywhere you go. So, yes you can turn down your thermostat but remember there’s no need to shiver at home to lose weight. Thin Ice has your back (and feet).


What comprises Thin Ice Technology?

Thin Ice technology uses specialized Peltier cooling chips to chill specific areas of the body. Peltier chips are also found in other technologies with compact cooling requirements such as microprocessors and various electronics. They essentially act as heat pumps, forcing heat to one side and leaving the other side cool. 
These chips are powered by an unobtrusive battery that's located under the arch that simultaneously helps to provide arch support.

The warmed sides of the Peltier chips are located on the bottom of the insole. The warmth generated by the Peltier mechanism can be dissipated through a variety of heat sink materials. There are also technologies that are able to capture heat and convert heat into electricity that are currently being explored by our engineering team. The Thin Ice engineering team is currently hard at work making sure the best possible heat dissipation/capturing mechanisms are combined in the final prototype for maximal comfort and battery efficiency. Hey, that reminds me, meet our engineering team!

The Thin Ice Engineering Team


Thin Ice also worked with a student engineering team from George Brown College on a contract dedicated specifically to exploring mechanism to increase battery life through connect mechanisms and for dissipating the warmth produced by the base of the Peltier chips.Finally, Thin Ice has project in the works at York University in Toronto through their Innovation York program including 2 engineering specialist professors. The project is in the final stages of its review process. These professors would be exploring the optimal materials to maximize the effectiveness of Thin Ice products.

There is no shortage of talented minds working on the Thin Ice product research and development. For this reason, we expect to surmount all the engineering hurdles remaining in the Thin Ice product development project and to deliver you your very own Thin Ice package in line with our projected dates.


A closer look at our productsThe top of the insole is made of a graphite based material perfect for skin contact. At the bottom we have a special heat sink insulating material that works well with the 5 Peltier Chips that reside within, which dissipate heat using power from a rechargeable 4-volt battery located in the arch support. Our engineering team will work to incorporate several kinetic power charging technologies into the final product. The more you walk the more you charge the battery!

The Thin Ice Story

Thin Ice was created by personal trainer, former NCAA Athlete, University of Toronto Alumni in Neuroscience and Psychology, Adam Paulin, who is passionate about fitness and human performance. Here is his description of his journey:

“I’ve spent a lot of time asking myself how we can hack our bodies into optimal performance using science. There is a certain satisfaction in making your body do your bidding"".
In Tim Ferris's revolutionary book, the 4-Hour Body - which everyone should check out - he talks extensively about cold temperatures and their weight-loss effects. I wondered why no one had harnessed this method in product form. There had to be a way to make using cold temperatures for weight-loss more convenient without having to suffer through 20 minutes of hell in an ice bath.

What stood out the most in the book was Tim’s comparison of the effects of ice baths versus stimulation using ice packs. What Tim demonstrated is that simply wearing an ice pack on certain parts of the neck you could expect to see 60% of the weight-loss effects as a 20 minute (torture-worthy) ice bath. Using a method you could implement thoughtlessly while watching Friends, you could see a big portion of the results you would achieve shivering away your calories for 20 minutes.


As a personal trainer at the time, I began to see the biggest factor stopping people from achieving an effective weight-loss regime. Clients would come up with every excuse under the sun to skip a session, but it really came down to one thing: going to the gym was not convenient. I knew this ice pack hack was the way to go, but was distracted from considering the matter further until I finished my studies at the University of Toronto. When I was done with my undergrad I knew I wanted to take at least one year off before braving med school applications so I did the only logical thing: I started inventing products.
This is when I remembered the potential of harnessing the cold temperatures to induce weight-loss. The Thin Ice shoe (the precursor to the Thin Ice insole) came to me quite early but I didn’t see its true potential right away. When I started telling people I was inevitably met with the same look of shock and amazement. “So, what you’re saying is I can lose weight all day and night just by wearing an insole?”. “Yes you can!”, I’d say. I started to realize I had something on my hands worth pursuing, so I learned to be an entrepreneur through many trials and errors, and benefitted from the mentorship of some of the greatest minds I’ve had the privilege to meet. 

I assembled an amazing team and the idea started to materialize. We now have a proof of concept prototype and a pitch in front of the CBC's Dragons under our belt, Dragons' Den was a surreal experience. Imagine walking down echoing stairs into the pitch black den only to be confronted with five rich investment giants when the lights are abruptly flicked on. You just have to remember you're one of the few people who will ever get this opportunity and continue with your pitch! I've sworn secrecy of the results of our appearance until the end of the next season but hopefully you'll be able to me on the show next fall or winter!""What will we do with $50,000?This is the minimum amount we need when combined with our other sources of financing to develop the product, perform any required modifications, manufacture it and ship it to our backers. By helping us get this very valuable funding and voting with your feet, we can put all the pieces of the puzzle together and provide you with your very own Thin Ice system.Why you should support usWe really think that this product will be a disruptive force in the weight-loss industry. A revolution in convenience, effectiveness and design. We have built several prototype devices and would love to have you be on the front lines with us getting this product to the masses.  That's why were are currently offering 35-50% OFF the projected retail price of our products.  Its our way of saying thank you for supporting us in our infancy.Here are several reasons why more financing is a better thing for you as a backer:
It will allow us finish development and get you the product faster.
It will allow us to run trials that help to quantify the results of the product so we can add standardized results to the app. This will let you know how many calories you’re losing using Thin Ice technology on a second-to-second basis!
It will allow us to start aggressively marketing our brand globally so we can alert people around the world of our new approach to weight-loss and help them to join the movement.
There are a bunch of discrete milestones we hope we can reach with you and we’ll be sure to keep you updated on which ones we’re approaching next! There will also be something new and exciting we can do with the brand with additional funding.Another great reason to support this campaignWe will match 5% of all funds raised on Indiegogo with the direct purchase of food that we will send to hungry children around the world. We have partnered up with RTG group to make this carry out this task. Together we can balance the global scale of malnourished by leaning out the overfed and feeding the hungry. Every 6 seconds a child dies from malnutrition. Help us re-calibrate that clock, one child at a time while simultaneously investing in your own health. There is a reason ""RTG"" stands for ""Receiving Through Giving"".

FAQ


Where do we ship? 
Shipping is available WORLDWIDE and is automatically calculated based on the country you select in the purchasing process. Shipping to Canada and US is 10 USD and shipping internationally is 49 USD.

When should I ideally use the Thin Ice Vest? 
The vest is light and comfortable enough to be slept in and versatile enough to wear under common clothing. It is sleeveless so you can wear it with a variety of outfits. The vest can also be worn safely to bed where you can burn significant calories while you are fast asleep. 

When should I ideally use the Thin Ice Insole? 
The insole is most effective when walking, sitting, commuting, working at a desk, lounging and generally going about your day. The insole can be worn in almost all footwear, including open toe shoes so you can even be burning fat during a night on the town.


What is the warranty?

We offer a 1 year warranty on the mechanical parts. The layer of the product that touches the skin is replaceable however, so you can buy those parts to keep the vest or insole looking and feeling (and smelling) like new. 

Technical FAQ

How do I charge the insole/vest? 
The insole and vest will be fully rechargeable using a charging pad which will be included with the product.  

Does it work with iOS and Android Devices?  
Yes, the app will be available for iOS and Android.


How long does the battery last?  

Around 4-8 hours for the insole, 6-8 for the vest. This may change depending on how much juice we can squeeze out of the kinetic mechanism. Remember, the more you walk the longer the insole battery will last. Walking more never hurt anybody in the weight-loss department either :)


How long does the battery take to charge?  

Around two hours from a fully discharged state.

What temperature range does it work with?
The temperature ranges from very mild to relatively intense. We are still streamlining the exact, optimal range to have you losing the most fat with the most possible comfort.

How safe is the insole for weight bearing?
You can safely wear the insole during low intensity activities like walking, lounging, commuting, working at your desk and doing everyday things. We recommend avoiding weight bearing exercises such as weight lifting, running, or any high impact sports. The vest is a good alternative for weight bearing activities that put pressure on the feet such as jogging.

What is the recommended length of use for the insole/vest?
As long as you feel comfortable with. If you experience any discomfort adjust settings using your smart device.  

How do you wash the product?
For everyday cleaning it is recommended to use an antibiotic wipe. If the material that touches the skin becomes too worn out you can replace just that layer. The rest of the vest or insole is totally reusable and doesn’t need to be replaced.

Other FAQ

Can I get the insole/vest in my size? 
Yes, the insoles come in the standard range of shoes sizes, women’s 6-10, and men’s 8-12. The vests come in sizes ranging from S-XXL for both men and women. If you ask us we can probably also accommodate child sizes. After all, little Jimmy can't run 5K while he's playing video games but he can lose weight wearing Thin Ice.

Who did your movie? 
Our movie was put together by us! If you enjoyed the video and want us to help you create your own please refer to the applicable perk.

The service includes 1.) a consultation session or two to flush out your idea and help craft the script. 2.) The organization of a day long shoot where in we arrange for a videographer to record you talking about your product, filming some b-roll and product demos, and 3.) professional editing, graphics, music and sound mixing. 

Depending on your location, the organization of the shoot will require some negotiation. So please talk to us! We’re a friendly bunch.

Can I change or cancel my perk?
Indiegogo policy dictates that campaign owners have no ability to adjust perk selections. That means we cannot upgrade your perk, we cannot change your perk and we cannot cancel your perk. Please note that contributions made on Indiegogo are also non-refundable.

How do I get the Early Bird pricing?
You’ll have to hurry as we only offer a limited quantity (20) of Thin Ice products at such a ridiculously low price. What do you want from us!? We're already giving you 35% off for the campaign's set price!

Does the Thin Ice apparel offer different colour choices?
As Henry Ford was fond of saying, “You can choose any colour you’d like - as long as it’s black.” The clothing and insoles are black, but since they will most likely be hidden underneath your clothing, it won’t affect your fashion. However, if we receive a certain amount of requests for a specific colour through support, we’d be more than happy to accommodate those requests. Please feel free to share your ideas.

Will people with chronic diseases be able to use the product?
People with poor circulation or diabetes should consult their physician before using the products. This product does not cure any chronic conditions.

<p>Where does my story begin? 
Well actually it begins with the death of my father.  Then a few months later my house burned
down.  Lastly, a couple of months later
my mother passed away.  </p>
<p>So one morning I
was out walking my dog thinking about life and I realized my ears are cold and I wished I
had a hood.  Then I remember all of the
times I was wearing my trench coat because it was raining or just cold outside and that it did not have a hood.</p>
<p>
So this I call my V-8 moment for all of you who remember the V-8 commercial
where they slap their head because they just realized the simplest
concept.  So I started playing through my
mind all of the stores, Target, Sears, Walmart, Macy’s, Mens Warehouse.  I realized that there is no such thing as a
universably attachable hood. I went into the stores to double check and could not
find it.  I did a patent search, nope not
there. So right away I filed for the patent.</p>
<p>So now we have the INSTAHOOD!!!! The first universally
attachable hood!!!!!</p>
<p>I think you will like what we have come up with.  We have sizes to fit everyone from age 5 to adult in men's and women's styles.  </p>
<p>We have two versions for connecting to your
garment.</p>
<p>Magnet version for
shirts, sweaters, light jackets.</p>
<p>Clip version for heavier garments and coats and physical activity.  (Use the clip version for jogging and sports
activities)</p>
<p>We have hoods for every day. We have Rain hoods.  We have hoods for camping or hunting.  Lastly, our newest creation,
the masked hood or the Ninja hood, a hood with a retractable piece to cover
your face for those especially cold or windy days.</p>
<p>We can customize the hood with family pictures or your favorite saying.  We will be marketing to all the high schools,  universities, sports teams, corporations and we hope to have it in all of your favorite department stores.  </p>

<p>Or if you want to purchase it from home, visit our website INSTAHOOD.NET  and purchase it directly starting in July.</p>

I have a
small but frequent client base that I maintained whilst working from home.
 This may sound like a luxury, but believe me, spending all your life
within the same four walls can drive you a little stir crazy.
Client Tuxedo
So I looked at a number of opportunities to broaden my horizons.
 
I applied to the infamous Central Saint Martins to study their
MA in Menswear Design, and was accepted by the late great Louise Wilson.
A combination of weighing up what I thought I would get out of
the course, the passing of Louise, and the cost lead me to withdraw early.
I thought long and hard about what it was that I loved about the
course, and how I could better use that money I would have spent.
What appealed to me was getting up every morning and leaving the
house to go this great space.  A space with access to all kinds of
machines, equipment and resources.  Not only that but a space filled with
a rich network of creative students and tutors all doing their own thing.
What I didn't like was the academic restrictions, like being
told how to layout a sketchbook and how I shouldn't worry about the commerciality
of my work.
So I began search for a place that has one without the other.
 All the pros without any of the cons.  A space that has the creative
vibe of a university but without any of the restrictions, a place where you can
play, learn but most importantly, make, and make money from your work.
But I couldn't find one. 
So I decided to create my own.
I invested all I had, borrowed from friends and family, took
loans and called in as many favours as I could.

I found an amazing location

We support this cause in a variety of ways...</h3><p><strong>ONE,</strong> through realizing that too many women are TIRED of sacrificing comfort for high-end fashion. We fully believe that the most expertly made luxury women's shoes should be comfortable, supportive, sensual, a piece of visual art, well-made and should feature the highest quality materials. That is why we stand by our mission to create uber comfortable yet sensual shoes for women, allowing her to feel more confident with every step.</p><p>We use an extremely durable and flexible medical-grade memory foam cushioning inside every one of our shoes, allowing the cushion to mold to your specific arch and foot shape. Also, on all high heel models, we use a discreet EVA foam platform, which provides extra cushioning on the balls of your feet, allowing for longer wear without the pain. In addition, we use a thin textured rubber sole, which is much more durable and has better traction than the leather soles used in most designer shoes. As we found that many busy women will have thin rubber soles applied to the bottom of their designer shoes at a shoe repair shop, to protect them, before they even wear them once, we figured it was smart to make shoes that already have soles you can actually walk and live in. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1490761610/fu7m4unurf1bs9cgwpqc.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1490761741/ore67d0flhkxt99lllq9.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p> </p><p><strong>TWO, </strong>we support female empowerment through giving back to the cause, literally. Ten percent of our profits go directly towards a female-focused non-profit called Catalyst Ministries, which seeks to rescue, rehabilitate, and empower women and children who have been trafficked, enslaved or abused, internationally as well as in the US. Feel free to check out more at <a href=""http://www.catalystministries.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.catalystministries.net</a> </p><p>The <strong>THIRD </strong>way that A.CHRISTINE Design supports the female empowerment cause is in how we are choosing to set the values of our brand. As this brand grows, our marketing campaigns will seek to show the value, dignity, innate beauty and strength of a woman, rather than objectifying her. We value health and self-care, so will select models of all nationalities who are natural-looking, yet also healthy and strong. We do not believe that choosing only size 0 and 2 models represents what a beautiful woman is. </p><p>And <strong>FOURTH</strong>, we seek to create a brand inspired by the uniqueness of each woman's individual spirit and beauty. Our main source of design inspiration is the female body, with its sensual curves. Other inspirations include art, nature and architecture. We feel that the designer shoe market is saturated with styles that repeat themselves, so we take great joy in bringing something different to you. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1490762298/bci7n6eswaasyqdq6ip8.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1490762110/mpotfalqywtrc26llz1q.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1490762138/hljvjaj0xlqoirj36f05.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p> </p><h2>THE COLLECTION</h2><p> </p><h3>Aqua Suede and Leather Flats</h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1490758014/im50iid1ul8jrvk0ogpa.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1490824471/lazyfsh4jvnjd0zrgwgq.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1490758171/omjb4qz455ugwnu78gdc.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h3> </h3><h3>Black Suede and Snakeskin Flats</h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1490760795/kowwmyjzvswarfypjvvm.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1490825389/svwdvysfwuzw6drkg8ni.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1490760845/a0oly3g40o5l1vetaymm.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p> </p><h3>Black Snakeskin Crescent Heels</h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1490761054/ytwckek3rbikce7bx1av.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1490766450/rltbisx28jjweopxojev.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1490767082/dfj2ubvatvfvy8atfxzp.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h3> </h3><h3>Plum Snakeskin Crescent Heels</h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1490761165/al4qbkxr6lyb0ljyh8mx.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1490761196/pilwrtdvi2cdgxg94fwv.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p> </p><h2>ADDITIONAL ITEMS</h2><h3> </h3><h3>Mini Wonder Woman Leather Tassel Key chain</h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1490831966/b0ak01svrsuzmge26iv5.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h3> </h3><h3>Black Tailored V-Neck T-Shirt with White Logo and 'freedom and empowerment' quote</h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1496167546/ylrmpeo1vbw3kb2d0v73.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1496167495/ucf91tr5hrlcwrdktvib.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1491182035/fki0uebksyy0pfb4hklc.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p> </p><h3><strong>WHERE THE MONEY WILL GO</strong></h3><p><strong>We are asking for $10,000.

We support this cause in a variety of ways...ONE, through realizing that too many women are TIRED of sacrificing comfort for high-end fashion. We fully believe that the most expertly made luxury women's shoes should be comfortable, supportive, sensual, a piece of visual art, well-made and should feature the highest quality materials. That is why we stand by our mission to create uber comfortable yet sensual shoes for women, allowing her to feel more confident with every step.We use an extremely durable and flexible medical-grade memory foam cushioning inside every one of our shoes, allowing the cushion to mold to your specific arch and foot shape. Also, on all high heel models, we use a discreet EVA foam platform, which provides extra cushioning on the balls of your feet, allowing for longer wear without the pain. In addition, we use a thin textured rubber sole, which is much more durable and has better traction than the leather soles used in most designer shoes. As we found that many busy women will have thin rubber soles applied to the bottom of their designer shoes at a shoe repair shop, to protect them, before they even wear them once, we figured it was smart to make shoes that already have soles you can actually walk and live in.  TWO, we support female empowerment through giving back to the cause, literally. Ten percent of our profits go directly towards a female-focused non-profit called Catalyst Ministries, which seeks to rescue, rehabilitate, and empower women and children who have been trafficked, enslaved or abused, internationally as well as in the US. Feel free to check out more at www.catalystministries.net The THIRD way that A.CHRISTINE Design supports the female empowerment cause is in how we are choosing to set the values of our brand. As this brand grows, our marketing campaigns will seek to show the value, dignity, innate beauty and strength of a woman, rather than objectifying her. We value health and self-care, so will select models of all nationalities who are natural-looking, yet also healthy and strong. We do not believe that choosing only size 0 and 2 models represents what a beautiful woman is. And FOURTH, we seek to create a brand inspired by the uniqueness of each woman's individual spirit and beauty. Our main source of design inspiration is the female body, with its sensual curves. Other inspirations include art, nature and architecture. We feel that the designer shoe market is saturated with styles that repeat themselves, so we take great joy in bringing something different to you.  THE COLLECTION Aqua Suede and Leather Flats Black Suede and Snakeskin Flats Black Snakeskin Crescent Heels Plum Snakeskin Crescent Heels ADDITIONAL ITEMS Mini Wonder Woman Leather Tassel Key chain Black Tailored V-Neck T-Shirt with White Logo and 'freedom and empowerment' quote WHERE THE MONEY WILL GOWe are asking for $10,000.

They are associated with the sun, the good times ... but they are much more than you think... fell the summer enjoys wearing them.Through this project, our company is launching the DM brand name. Indeed, this is the way to share creative art work through accessories which have been designed and fashioned by the Artist himself.The Flip Flops are offered in a limited edition, including two flanges of Fabric/Nylon, more resistant and very pleasant for the summer season. The sole has been manufactured to be lighter and more comfortable. All these elements have been established to achieve an unique product that meets high standards while being very fashionable. 
Each painting shows us a universe and a different ambience full of vitality and spontaneity. In this collection, you will find 3 different models of Flip Flops and a specially designed handbag, all inspired and created by the Artist.

Story
Hello, I am Olivier , CEO-founder and
Creative Director of the eponymous Olivier Ruca® brand. After 7 years as a
Product Designer and Quality Controller at a woodstove manufacturer in Belgium,
I moved to London in the summer of 2013 to seek new opportunities. I had my Eureka moment between November 2012 and
June 2013, while trekking the Sierra Nevada in California and later on when at
the Grand Canyon, Los Angeles, Chicago, Wisconsin, New York. While this was a
fertile moment for creativity, seeing the dynamism of American entrepreneurism

On the day prior to the race, I visited the runners Expo in search of a shirt to wear the following morning, knowing that freezing temps beckoned at the race's start, and mid 70's towards its end. It was suggested by staff at the Expo that I either wear a sweatshirt (and discard of it a few miles in) or tough it out by wearing a tank top/tee shirt. I figured that the former option would result in me casting off a perfectly good sweatshirt, and the latter would result in my expending vital energy prior to the run due to my body shivering. ""That's it?"" I thought. ""Those are my only two options?"" (Another slightly better option, the arm compression sleeve, would come later). It was at that moment I determined there had to be a better way..</p><p>But, what could be done to solve this problem? Following an intensive search process, I was fortunate to have discovered the Apparel Agency in Chicago which specialize in bringing conceptual athletic apparel to life. After several months of collaboration, we were able to develop the Tearadactyl 1.0 prototype (seen below)</p><p></p><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/005/388/480/a7bd02684d330bcee1374e1d1cef5bdc_original.jpg?w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1455893962&amp;auto=format&amp;q=92&amp;s=b6e001c46ecd6cbff71a6d83c132c93b"" src="""" style=""""/></figure><p></p>The goal of this first iteration of the Tearadactyl shirt was to prove that we could successfully develop a performance shirt which had arm sleeves the athlete could remove on the fly (concerns about the shirt's aesthetic value would come later). Mission accomplished, thanks to the lovely ladies who helped test the shirt's efficacy on the famous North Avenue Beach running path in Chicago! This was a good start, but we needed to go back to the lab and work on further enhancing the efficacy and aesthetics of our new creation.<div>
<p></p>
<figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/005/388/492/335e396fab88c6b9a9cb0dea96bee30e_original.jpg?w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1455894112&amp;auto=format&amp;q=92&amp;s=d6839e01aa0bb943e9d3d97bc5ed19b5"" src="""" style=""""/></figure><p></p>
About six months later, the Tearadactyl 2.0 prototype was born (see above). There were several changes made with this new adaptation including (1) changing the shirt material to a signature grey color composed of a polyamide/elastane fabric, (2) converted the side mesh sleeve pockets to two ""self material"" compartments located at the rear of the shirt, (3) added a heat pressed logo with the name ""Tearadactyl"" located on the upper back of the shirt and a heat pressed company logo on the front left chest area (4) added contrast stitching throughout the shirt for effect (5) maintained a front flap zipper pocket for an MP3 player along with a grommet hole to accomodate a headphone cord and (6) maintained thumb holes on each sleeve.</div><div>
<p></p>
<figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/005/388/520/8a9b0b9ff6205be2314bc43e3320514b_original.png?w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1455894475&amp;auto=format&amp;lossless=true&amp;s=b67f81cdfaa80de97d5ad5dec6405541"" src="""" style=""""/></figure><p></p>
<p>In our ongoing quest to create the premier and original convertible athletic shirt, we will be making a few additional modifications to our debut Tearadactyl model prior to its release to the public. These adjustments will include (1) adding angled mesh panels to each rear sleeve pocket to facilitate passage of precipitation/moisture (2) changing the contrast stitching throughout the shirt to an amethyst color for the women's model and a light orange color for the men's and (3) introducing a softer, thinner material underneath each armhole to cover the exposed zippers in order to eliminate chaffing.</p>

<p>We will also be kicking off our sales and marketing campaign with our Tearadactyl Athlete of the Month (see above photo for our January edition). The theme of our campaign will be athletes on location throughout the city of Chicago performing their fitness regimens while wearing a Tearadactyl Athletic shirt. We will also be presenting an original monthly music mix entitled ""Tearing up the Trail with Tearadactyl"" featuring Chicago's own DJ Anton!</p>

</div><div>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>FAQ's</b></p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Where can I get more information about Tearadactyl Athletic? </b>The best place to stay up to date on all things Tearadactyl would be either our company website (<a href=""http://www.tearadactylrunning.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.tearadactylathletic.com</a>) or following us on our Facebook business page (facebook/tearadactylathletic) or our Twitter business page (twitter/tearadactylathletic)</li>
<li>
<b>How does a Tearadactyl Athletic shirt stack up against all of its competition in the performance apparel market? </b>Firstly, we have a patent pending on the actual shirt design itself, so our product is in a unique and exclusive class of its own. If you consider the alternatives out there to help, for example a runner, self-regulate their upper body temperature, they would consist of utliitizing an old sweatshirt (and casting it off mid-run), the arm compression sleeve (which has storage issues while running as well as can be easily lost, and further only covers a part of the runners arm), or simply exposing your upper body to the elements in a tee shirt or tank top and dealing with all of the extremes the environmental conditions might present. There will no doubt be more high tech products in the future capable of regulating one's upper body temperature during a run, but the fabrics they will utilize in production will most likely be largely untested when they are introduced (carcinogenic?), expensive, and may not hold up well to frequent trips through the washing machine.</li>
<li>
<b>Is the Tearadactyl shirt designed only for runners, or might there be other athletic applications for this shirt? </b>The shirt was originally designed with the runner in mind, however there are several other practical applications for our product including (1) hiking (2) biking (3) yoga (4) working out, (5) competing in triathlons,and an unlimited number of other athletic endeavors. Further, the Tearadactyl is, for all intents and purposes, an all season shirt as it can be used as a layering piece during the winter months, as a stand alone piece during spring and fall months, and in its sleeveless incarnation during the summer months (this shirt provides you with a range of options!). It is also comfortable enough to be used for everyday purposes such as going for walks or lounging around the house.</li>
<li>
<b>Will the Tearadactyl shirt be available in any other colors besides grey? </b>The shirt will only be available in the signature grey color during our first year of production. Depending on the demand, we plan on introducing the shirt in a variety of other colors in future production years.</li>
<li>
<b>In what temperature range will the Tearadactyl shirt be most effective? </b>Our product is designed to work in what we would call ""moderately cold to warm conditions"" (40-75 degrees F). If you find it to be a particularly cold day, the ""closed containment"" nature of the shirt can be enhanced by simply adding 1-2 air activated hand/body warmers to each of the sleeve pouches in the rear. The best part about this idea is these heat packs are both relatively inexpensive and biodegradable.</li>
<li>
<b>How big of a concern will chaffing underneath the arms be for long distance runners/hikers in relation to each respective zipper that encircles the shoulder region? </b>There are underarm flaps composed of a polyester/spandex material located along the zipper line so that the runner/hiker's underarm will not come into direct contact with the zipper. Like any material that comes into contact with body surfaces while running or hiking long distances, chaffing can obviously occur. However, it will not produce any more chaffing than one might expect while utilizing any other shirt while exhibiting a running/hiking motion over a prolonged period of time.</li>
<li>
<b>What is the primary reason behind starting your business? </b>I believe that athletes, in particular long distance runners and hikers, should maintain their body temperature within a narrow and safe range while engaging in physical activity. I further believe that the Tearadactyl Athletic shirt will provide athletes with both the most efficacious and aesthetically appealing manner by which to achieve this goal.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>At this point, funding for capital expenditures constitutes our only challenge to successfully launching Tearadactyl Athletic.</p>
<p>After fully self-funding the design and legal aspects, including patent and trademark, sufficient capital is needed in order to fulfilll our orders. Likewise, sufficient capital is required to ensure the successful launch of our marketing campaign and to secure the future growth of Tearadactyl Running as a brand.</p>

I figured that the former option would result in me casting off a perfectly good sweatshirt, and the latter would result in my expending vital energy prior to the run due to my body shivering. ""That's it?"" I thought. ""Those are my only two options?"" (Another slightly better option, the arm compression sleeve, would come later). It was at that moment I determined there had to be a better way..But, what could be done to solve this problem? Following an intensive search process, I was fortunate to have discovered the Apparel Agency in Chicago which specialize in bringing conceptual athletic apparel to life. After several months of collaboration, we were able to develop the Tearadactyl 1.0 prototype (seen below)The goal of this first iteration of the Tearadactyl shirt was to prove that we could successfully develop a performance shirt which had arm sleeves the athlete could remove on the fly (concerns about the shirt's aesthetic value would come later). Mission accomplished, thanks to the lovely ladies who helped test the shirt's efficacy on the famous North Avenue Beach running path in Chicago! This was a good start, but we needed to go back to the lab and work on further enhancing the efficacy and aesthetics of our new creation.


About six months later, the Tearadactyl 2.0 prototype was born (see above). There were several changes made with this new adaptation including (1) changing the shirt material to a signature grey color composed of a polyamide/elastane fabric, (2) converted the side mesh sleeve pockets to two ""self material"" compartments located at the rear of the shirt, (3) added a heat pressed logo with the name ""Tearadactyl"" located on the upper back of the shirt and a heat pressed company logo on the front left chest area (4) added contrast stitching throughout the shirt for effect (5) maintained a front flap zipper pocket for an MP3 player along with a grommet hole to accomodate a headphone cord and (6) maintained thumb holes on each sleeve.


In our ongoing quest to create the premier and original convertible athletic shirt, we will be making a few additional modifications to our debut Tearadactyl model prior to its release to the public. These adjustments will include (1) adding angled mesh panels to each rear sleeve pocket to facilitate passage of precipitation/moisture (2) changing the contrast stitching throughout the shirt to an amethyst color for the women's model and a light orange color for the men's and (3) introducing a softer, thinner material underneath each armhole to cover the exposed zippers in order to eliminate chaffing.


We will also be kicking off our sales and marketing campaign with our Tearadactyl Athlete of the Month (see above photo for our January edition). The theme of our campaign will be athletes on location throughout the city of Chicago performing their fitness regimens while wearing a Tearadactyl Athletic shirt. We will also be presenting an original monthly music mix entitled ""Tearing up the Trail with Tearadactyl"" featuring Chicago's own DJ Anton!

FAQ's


Where can I get more information about Tearadactyl Athletic? The best place to stay up to date on all things Tearadactyl would be either our company website (www.tearadactylathletic.com) or following us on our Facebook business page (facebook/tearadactylathletic) or our Twitter business page (twitter/tearadactylathletic)

How does a Tearadactyl Athletic shirt stack up against all of its competition in the performance apparel market? Firstly, we have a patent pending on the actual shirt design itself, so our product is in a unique and exclusive class of its own. If you consider the alternatives out there to help, for example a runner, self-regulate their upper body temperature, they would consist of utliitizing an old sweatshirt (and casting it off mid-run), the arm compression sleeve (which has storage issues while running as well as can be easily lost, and further only covers a part of the runners arm), or simply exposing your upper body to the elements in a tee shirt or tank top and dealing with all of the extremes the environmental conditions might present. There will no doubt be more high tech products in the future capable of regulating one's upper body temperature during a run, but the fabrics they will utilize in production will most likely be largely untested when they are introduced (carcinogenic?), expensive, and may not hold up well to frequent trips through the washing machine.

Is the Tearadactyl shirt designed only for runners, or might there be other athletic applications for this shirt? The shirt was originally designed with the runner in mind, however there are several other practical applications for our product including (1) hiking (2) biking (3) yoga (4) working out, (5) competing in triathlons,and an unlimited number of other athletic endeavors. Further, the Tearadactyl is, for all intents and purposes, an all season shirt as it can be used as a layering piece during the winter months, as a stand alone piece during spring and fall months, and in its sleeveless incarnation during the summer months (this shirt provides you with a range of options!). It is also comfortable enough to be used for everyday purposes such as going for walks or lounging around the house.

Will the Tearadactyl shirt be available in any other colors besides grey? The shirt will only be available in the signature grey color during our first year of production. Depending on the demand, we plan on introducing the shirt in a variety of other colors in future production years.

In what temperature range will the Tearadactyl shirt be most effective? Our product is designed to work in what we would call ""moderately cold to warm conditions"" (40-75 degrees F). If you find it to be a particularly cold day, the ""closed containment"" nature of the shirt can be enhanced by simply adding 1-2 air activated hand/body warmers to each of the sleeve pouches in the rear. The best part about this idea is these heat packs are both relatively inexpensive and biodegradable.

How big of a concern will chaffing underneath the arms be for long distance runners/hikers in relation to each respective zipper that encircles the shoulder region? There are underarm flaps composed of a polyester/spandex material located along the zipper line so that the runner/hiker's underarm will not come into direct contact with the zipper. Like any material that comes into contact with body surfaces while running or hiking long distances, chaffing can obviously occur. However, it will not produce any more chaffing than one might expect while utilizing any other shirt while exhibiting a running/hiking motion over a prolonged period of time.

What is the primary reason behind starting your business? I believe that athletes, in particular long distance runners and hikers, should maintain their body temperature within a narrow and safe range while engaging in physical activity. I further believe that the Tearadactyl Athletic shirt will provide athletes with both the most efficacious and aesthetically appealing manner by which to achieve this goal.



Risks and challenges
At this point, funding for capital expenditures constitutes our only challenge to successfully launching Tearadactyl Athletic.
After fully self-funding the design and legal aspects, including patent and trademark, sufficient capital is needed in order to fulfilll our orders. Likewise, sufficient capital is required to ensure the successful launch of our marketing campaign and to secure the future growth of Tearadactyl Running as a brand.",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><b>1)  </b><b>What is a
social enterprise?</b></p>
<p><i>A social enterprise is an organization that
applies commercial strategies to generate improvements in human and
environmental well-being— which may include (and does in our case!) using a
percentage of profits to address social and environmental problems.</i></p>
<p><b>2)  </b><b>How will
Blue Bear make an impact? </b></p>
<p><i>Conserving habitats
= conserving wildlife. Bears are roaming creatures and need plenty of space to
survive. Climate change and expansion of industry, agriculture and urban sprawl

The Tibetan Blue Bear is an ancient subspecies of the brown bear found in the eastern Tibetan plateau and is one of the most recent species of bear to become extinct in the wild. Project Blue Bear is focused on off-setting the impacts of human activity, and aims to promote environmental sustainability and combat climate change. The reality is that if there are 100,000,000 different species on Earth, and if the extinction rate is just 0.01% per year, then 10,000 species go extinct every year. 

Project Blue Bear’s approach has two main objectives:


1) Provide financial backing to organizations and projects with existing habitat conservation and restoration initiatives throughout the world. 

2) Provide information and foster awareness with regard to threats facing the global bear population.




                                 


The Blue Bear Project is a social enterprise, a for profit
entity with an environmental mission. Profits from the Blue Bear Project will
go towards organizations and initiatives focused on protecting the eight
species of bear remaining today. By providing streams of capital from a
scalable entity, operating within a well-established industry, it is our goal
to provide quality apparel, and enable partnership organizations to bolster
their impact protecting endangered species of bear.


    






When you receive your package from Blue Bear, take
a picture in your new apparel and tag us on Twitter! We’ll post
it to the page and if your photo gets enough retweets or likes, you’ll get free
shipping off your next order. 


If you can't contribute to our campaign, you can still help by sharing our campaign with your friends and family. You can also find us on Twitter and Instagram – follow us and help spread the word! 



Thank you! We appreciate your support.

1)  What is a
social enterprise?
A social enterprise is an organization that
applies commercial strategies to generate improvements in human and
environmental well-being— which may include (and does in our case!) using a
percentage of profits to address social and environmental problems.
2)  How will
Blue Bear make an impact? 
Conserving habitats
= conserving wildlife. Bears are roaming creatures and need plenty of space to
survive. Climate change and expansion of industry, agriculture and urban sprawl
have been cutting in to bear habitat, placing humans and bears in conflict for
more than 100 years. A portion of every dollar spent with Project Blue Bear
will go towards organizations that are actively working to promote the
conservation and restoration of natural bear habitat in regions throughout the
world. 
3)  How does
Blue Bear source its apparel? 
Our current apparel is hand printed in America, and
is 100% cotton. We pledge to source our products with local suppliers that utilize
sustainable business practices. 
4) Will you have more styles and items in the future?
Yes! We are
constantly working to come up with new
designs and release new items! As we grow, we will have the capacity to branch
out and offer a wide range of apparel to our customers.

5) How can I contact you? 
Just email us - founders@projectbluebear.com
6) Do we ship internationally?
Yes we do! However, there will be an additional charge depending on your whereabouts. 

7) What sizes do we offer?
We offer a variety of sizes! We currently offer small, medium, large, and extra-large. Please email us if you need any additional information.",29.0,0,"1 Campaign

according to plan to meet the promised deadlines. Projects often have 
trouble when facing the production process and deadlines for shipment. 
The project could face possible challenges if the quality of the product
 or packaging does not meet our requirements after production. However, 
we have extensive experience and close relations in manufacturing and 
production. In addition, we will not be outsourcing the post-production 
work to another company. Our team in Vienna and NYC is prepared to 
ensure that post-funding will run like clockwork when the time comes. 
(pun-intended) Although we do not see any direct risks and challenges, 
there are always indirect or unseen tasks that may present itself during
 the process of production. We hope to run everything as streamlined as 
possible and ahead of schedule.<br/></div>","Currently the most affordable on the trackWe've found that there's a niche between cheap watches and highest 
possible quality. So we decide to build an affordable that lasts for 
long. 
Made with the finest, 1500°C - 2732°F, superheated ceramic bezel,
 the top ring which encompasses and fastens the sapphire crystal of our 
WATKINS to ensure the 10 bar waterproofness of your watch and a surgial 
standard steel case.This watch is an homage to the glorious race curcuit 'TheGlen', NY, USA.
 Charismatic F1 champions like Jim Clark, Emerson Fittipaldi,Niki Lauda,
 James Hunt or Gilles Villeneuve won races at Watkins Glen. Nowadays,the
 NASCAR and Indycars series battle it out on this celebrated track. Do you remember the last America's Cup or last racing season? It was blue and red. These inspired us to create a dial with the two-toned big date.The fuel to our engine and to our success is that we love what we’re 
doing, we love to create watches. Functional, and modern,manufactured to
 the highest standards of horological engineering.Pole position for the WATKINS collectionWe’ve repaired thousands of watches over the years. Highprecisely and 
with a hefty price tag. Last years we've got the idea designing a watch 
that is affordable, contemporary, stylish and that is equally at home in
 the great outdoors as well as at work. The chronographs of WATKINS are a little differentOur customers may drive a Jaguar f type, a Hunter Marine Yacht, or you 
might find them racing on a track, in the water or in the air. Our new 
WATKINS “Curriculum No8” pledge collection combines all those attributes
 at a price far lower than other watches of this high standard of 
craftsmanship. We deliver direct to the consumer, without any retail markups.Closing the gap to the leadersBy marketing directly to our customers and through Kickstarter, we 
eliminate the high cost of regular advertising while cutting out the 
proverbial middleman.

The result: While other watches in the top quality category sell for 
1000€ and up, we are able to offer the WATKINS “Curriculum No8” 
Collection on Kickstarter starting from only 149€ (~$165)!We have created the ""Curriculum No8"" series, which combines 
ruggedness, flexibility and functionality for all kinds of 
environments. 
The core part of this watch is the bezel. This top-ring has to endure more abrasion than any other part of the watch. 1500°C - 2732°F, superheated ceramic bezel
Ceramic powders are superheated to 1500C to harden and solidify them 
into the bezel shape. Once shaped, it’s highly polished to provide it 
with a beautiful luster. Impervious to scratches. It takes more than 48h to create each of these bezels and is much sought after by collectors.Are You ready to win? With a WATKINS you will beYour chronograph will come with a sapphire crystal and is
 available with a choice of bands: stainless steel, premium 
vegetable-tanned leather, suede leather and several color selections of

Over the next few weeks, the whole team here will be putting production 
plans together. Meanwhile we will rigorously source, test, and research 
the materials and production of the watches, and most importantly, 
working hard to get your watch to you as soon as possible. While the 
watches are being manufactured and packaged, we will be preparing for 
large scale shipment to our backers.We need you, the drivers, the engineers and the mechanics and 
last but not least the crowd who breathe life into these watches. Piece 
by piece, to complete this project in time before the fuel is empty. We spend a lot of money and time in upfront work and pre-process. Now 
it's sunday morning and we're in the grid. The engines are roaring, we 
are ready to go. And we all want to bring some silverware home. Isn't it?Based in Vienna, AUSTRIA, P.Beer GmbH is a family-run business 
operational. We're a solid team of european master watchmakers in third 
generation with well-developed and tested skills. This means we're able to hand assemble all our watches in our workshop, using materials sourced.Thank you so much for checking out our project!!! Please help us to share with your friends and family!Take advantage of a limited-time pre-order offer exclusively on Indiegogo and save $€$€ by purchasing before we launch.Risks and opportunitiesIf this project gets funded, we will have to make sure everything goes 
according to plan to meet the promised deadlines. Projects often have 
trouble when facing the production process and deadlines for shipment. 
The project could face possible challenges if the quality of the product
 or packaging does not meet our requirements after production. However, 
we have extensive experience and close relations in manufacturing and 
production. In addition, we will not be outsourcing the post-production 
work to another company. Our team in Vienna and NYC is prepared to 
ensure that post-funding will run like clockwork when the time comes. 
(pun-intended) Although we do not see any direct risks and challenges, 
there are always indirect or unseen tasks that may present itself during
 the process of production. We hope to run everything as streamlined as 
possible and ahead of schedule.",73.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>We will also be using capital to build out our eCommerce storefront and platform.  This will assist us with growing our Fundraising business unit to aid schools, clubs and organizations with turn-key programs leveraging social media.</p>

<p><b><i>“You can't steal second and keep one foot on first base.”</i></b>  My kids are probably sick of me saying that famous quote.  But it is one is my favorites as it summarizes
what I truly believe to be important in life – progress always involves risk; sometimes
you need to take chances to live life to the fullest.</p>
<p>Launching Zypr is my personal case of putting my money where my mouth is. I had an ""a ha"" moment while cleaning out our garage.  I was sorting through a mess of soccer balls we had piled in an old storage bin when it hit me.  Why hadn't someone made a more effective storage option for sports balls by now?  I commented to my wife about how sad it was that most of these kinds of sports products were made so cheaply that they clearly were intended to be disposable.</p>
<p>So I did a little research to see if I could find a quality, cost effective option that could handle all of the stuff in our garage.  You guessed it, I couldn't find one, we we decided to make one.  And from that, the Zypr was born.</p>
<p>With a prototype in hand, my wife, a marketing research junkie, couldn't wait to get feedback from friends and colleagues we though might need a Zypr in their life.  In the process, we learned that this snappy ball bag could also moonlight as a pretty amazing coach's bag, but i needed some additional bells and whistles - hence the interchangeable accessories.  Overall, the response was pretty great; so much so that we decided we had to take it to the next level.</p>
<p>With a focus on high-quality products for active families, we found our niche that we are very passionate about.  We are also excited about our partnerships wth non-profits and schools who desperately need high quality equipment and storage options.  We are grateful that we can help make a difference where it is needed most.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1461086498/Risks_and_Challenges_bkv3lj.jpg"" src="""" style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""/></p>
<p>Although my wife and I have over 40 years of business experience between us, we knew this launch would provide challenges we had not previously experienced. </p>
<p>To mitigate risks, we gathered a team of respected and experienced professionals to help.  Through collaboration we feel we have been able to identify and manage many of the issues that can be detrimental to a successful product launch. </p>
<p>We secured relationships with a number of respected fabricators. We did market research, developed product prototypes, and performed a great deal of product testing by putting this bag in the hands of people that will use and abuse our products beyond what most of our users could imagine.</p>
<p>To further mitigate risk for our supporters and ensure prompt reward for their support, we ordered 1000 units of our product and have them ready for shipment (see picture). We will send these products out as quickly as allowed by Indiegogo after the campaign is over. </p>
<p>We want our supporters to integrate their Zypr bag and accessories into their active lives and provide us feedback on the product. We want to hear what they like, but also what we can do to make the products better. We want to know how they use the product and what we can do to reach more active families. We want to see the before and after pictures of their garage, or the locations they take their Zypr bag. </p>
<p>Having already gone through the entire process from design to prototype to production run, including shipping and logistics to receive a sizeable order at our location, we are confident in our “team” and the process we collaborated upon to move forward and grow.</p>

<p><b>Why are the discounts relatively small compared to other campaigns?</b></p>
<p>The Zypr Sports bags use the best materials and construction methods. Putting a lot into those two aspects of the bags increases the cost more so than inexpensively made products.  Instead of raising the price, we kept the price low so more families could afford a high-quality storage product for their gear. As we bring more quality products to market, we hope our satisfied Zypr users will be there to support us again.  In short, we cannot discount too much and still sustain our objective of bringing more quality products to active families.</p>
<p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">When will I receive
my reward?</b><br/></p>
<p>We already have close to 1000 units on hand, and the accessories (water proof pouch, nylon cargo straps,
shoulder pad) have just been ordered. We expect to ship those units to
complete orders by late June/early July.</p>
<p>Additionally, more bags will be ordered as we monitor
campaign efforts and continue growth efforts.</p>
<p><b>Are these the only
colors for Zypr?</b></p>
<p>Yes, for now. 
Currently, the small bag has green trim, medium bag has blue trim and
the large bag has red trim.  Eventually,
we hope to be in the position to do custom colors and personalization on larger
orders.</p>
<p><b>Why are you not
offering the Zypr to international supporters?</b></p>
<p>Our objective was to bring to market the highest quality, most durable sports
bag using the best materials and construction methods available.  To make such a quality item, the cost is significant. We also wanted to price the bag
extremely competitively so our supporters could see and feel the value of our
product the first time they handled them. 
Our desire to get our quality bag to the masses at a value limits our
ability to offset shipping costs by minimizing margins any further.</p>
<p><b>What if I am
international and I really want the Zypr products?</b></p>
<p>We would love to work with international supporters to try
and find a mutually beneficially way to bring the Zypr products to you.  Please feel free to email us at <a href=""mailto:Contact@TheZypr.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Contact@TheZypr.com</a>.  Hopefully, we can find an efficient and
cost-effective way to navigate the logistics.</p>
<p><b>I understand the
waterproof pouch in the images/video is a prototype.  What does the actual waterproof pouch look
like?</b></p>
<p>Please check back here later during the campaign.  Because they had to dye the material and
waterproof it, they could not provide us a prototype that is the right PMS
(colors).</p>

The generosity of our supporters will help the Zypr move forward quickly.  Funds raised in this campaign will go toward an upcoming business trip to review the design and prototype progress on our next three products.  These products will require some additional capital for patent discovery and patent application if deemed worthy.
We will also be using capital to build out our eCommerce storefront and platform.  This will assist us with growing our Fundraising business unit to aid schools, clubs and organizations with turn-key programs leveraging social media.
We also will be pushing forward with our packaging initiative for our products as we work to create strong relationships with retailers.
If you would like more information on where the money is going, please do not hesitate to visit our current site www.TheZypr.com, or contact us through the campaign.
Thanks again for your support!








“You can't steal second and keep one foot on first base.”  My kids are probably sick of me saying that famous quote.  But it is one is my favorites as it summarizes
what I truly believe to be important in life – progress always involves risk; sometimes
you need to take chances to live life to the fullest.
Launching Zypr is my personal case of putting my money where my mouth is. I had an ""a ha"" moment while cleaning out our garage.  I was sorting through a mess of soccer balls we had piled in an old storage bin when it hit me.  Why hadn't someone made a more effective storage option for sports balls by now?  I commented to my wife about how sad it was that most of these kinds of sports products were made so cheaply that they clearly were intended to be disposable.
So I did a little research to see if I could find a quality, cost effective option that could handle all of the stuff in our garage.  You guessed it, I couldn't find one, we we decided to make one.  And from that, the Zypr was born.
With a prototype in hand, my wife, a marketing research junkie, couldn't wait to get feedback from friends and colleagues we though might need a Zypr in their life.  In the process, we learned that this snappy ball bag could also moonlight as a pretty amazing coach's bag, but i needed some additional bells and whistles - hence the interchangeable accessories.  Overall, the response was pretty great; so much so that we decided we had to take it to the next level.
With a focus on high-quality products for active families, we found our niche that we are very passionate about.  We are also excited about our partnerships wth non-profits and schools who desperately need high quality equipment and storage options.  We are grateful that we can help make a difference where it is needed most.

Although my wife and I have over 40 years of business experience between us, we knew this launch would provide challenges we had not previously experienced. 
To mitigate risks, we gathered a team of respected and experienced professionals to help.  Through collaboration we feel we have been able to identify and manage many of the issues that can be detrimental to a successful product launch. 
We secured relationships with a number of respected fabricators. We did market research, developed product prototypes, and performed a great deal of product testing by putting this bag in the hands of people that will use and abuse our products beyond what most of our users could imagine.
To further mitigate risk for our supporters and ensure prompt reward for their support, we ordered 1000 units of our product and have them ready for shipment (see picture). We will send these products out as quickly as allowed by Indiegogo after the campaign is over. 
We want our supporters to integrate their Zypr bag and accessories into their active lives and provide us feedback on the product. We want to hear what they like, but also what we can do to make the products better. We want to know how they use the product and what we can do to reach more active families. We want to see the before and after pictures of their garage, or the locations they take their Zypr bag. 
Having already gone through the entire process from design to prototype to production run, including shipping and logistics to receive a sizeable order at our location, we are confident in our “team” and the process we collaborated upon to move forward and grow.

                                     


Why are the discounts relatively small compared to other campaigns?
The Zypr Sports bags use the best materials and construction methods. Putting a lot into those two aspects of the bags increases the cost more so than inexpensively made products.  Instead of raising the price, we kept the price low so more families could afford a high-quality storage product for their gear. As we bring more quality products to market, we hope our satisfied Zypr users will be there to support us again.  In short, we cannot discount too much and still sustain our objective of bringing more quality products to active families.
When will I receive
my reward?
We already have close to 1000 units on hand, and the accessories (water proof pouch, nylon cargo straps,
shoulder pad) have just been ordered. We expect to ship those units to
complete orders by late June/early July.
Additionally, more bags will be ordered as we monitor
campaign efforts and continue growth efforts.
Are these the only
colors for Zypr?
Yes, for now. 
Currently, the small bag has green trim, medium bag has blue trim and
the large bag has red trim.  Eventually,
we hope to be in the position to do custom colors and personalization on larger
orders.
Why are you not
offering the Zypr to international supporters?
Our objective was to bring to market the highest quality, most durable sports
bag using the best materials and construction methods available.  To make such a quality item, the cost is significant. We also wanted to price the bag
extremely competitively so our supporters could see and feel the value of our
product the first time they handled them. 
Our desire to get our quality bag to the masses at a value limits our
ability to offset shipping costs by minimizing margins any further.
What if I am
international and I really want the Zypr products?
We would love to work with international supporters to try
and find a mutually beneficially way to bring the Zypr products to you.  Please feel free to email us at Contact@TheZypr.com.  Hopefully, we can find an efficient and
cost-effective way to navigate the logistics.
I understand the
waterproof pouch in the images/video is a prototype.  What does the actual waterproof pouch look
like?
Please check back here later during the campaign.  Because they had to dye the material and
waterproof it, they could not provide us a prototype that is the right PMS
(colors).",34.0,1,"1 Campaign

<p>Angie Finn and Meli Axford are sisters who started Systerly to change how fashion is produced. We're blue collar (our dad was a boiler-maker), good at what we do, hard-working and authentic.  Angie is a fashion designer with a PhD in Fashion and the commercial experience to back it up. Meli is a tech all-rounder who's spent 15 years making startups/building web applications.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;text-align: center;""><i>We're <strong>design thinkers</strong> with a combined 50 years experience in fashion and tech.<br/>We're innovating every aspect of the current outdated, fast fashion<br/>production processes and <strong>we're driving change!</strong></i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Systerly is a platform, not a dress. Our objective is to change the way we make designer fashion that surpasses fast fashion. We connect women who want to buy equitable and sustainable fashion with a network of local makers who work in their own studios, produce quality clothes and are well paid. We're pretty sure we're unique!  </p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;text-align: center;""><i>To fix Australia (and world) fashion consumers need to<br/><strong>vote </strong></i><i><strong>with their dollars</strong><br/>for more equitably produced products.  </i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>We're innovating and re-engineering every aspect of the design and production process that's currently ""broken"" by leveraging available tech and sustainable fashion practices.  Not only have we completely re-engineered the production process but we're also innovating new sizing techniques, sewing techniques, design techniques - innovation is part of our culture.</p>
<p>For us, fashion sustainability is about job satisfaction and work-life balance for the makers, as much as it is about efficiently using sustainable fabrics. Equity is about getting fairly remunerated for your effort. We've designed this dress to:</p>
<ul>
<li>suit you;</li>
<li>be made by a qualified maker in their own studio;</li>
<li>from Australian grown and made Merino wool;</li>
<li>for good pay. </li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>We're doing all of it! ​</i><strong><i>You can't top that.</i></strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p>Our business is designed to equitably enable makers.  We consider ourselves to be makers and have not factored profit into our model because we're happy to just be paid fairly for the work we do and don't want to profiteer.</p>
<p>The more people like you, who care and<strong> step up to fix fast fashion</strong>, the more local makers we can support.  Once you support the campaign, your contribution will bootstrap a maker onto the platform so they'll be able to earn $70 for each dress they make.  </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Let's break it down for you:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>We need</strong> to sell 1000 dresses in order to <strong>get 20 makers on the platform</strong> with a queue of orders rolling in so we can give the makers a steady stream of work. </li>
<li>
<strong>You get</strong> an awesome little black dress to wear that you are going to love and that's going to make you feel great every time you wear it because it will remind you that <strong>you're doing your bit</strong>!</li>
<li>The <strong>makers earn a living </strong>working at home with their families.</li>
<li>
<strong>Less fast fashion</strong> is produced because ours is slow fashion, that is, we only make a dress once someone buys it.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This is the difference your contribution will make:</p>
<ul>
<li>By selling these dresses <strong>we'll be able to </strong>provide a ""line of credit"" to our qualified makers so they can free up their working capital and order the dress packs on account.  For a maker who is making 10 dresses a week, that's $700 that they would normally need to fund themselves. (You can learn more about how our model works below).</li>
<li>
<strong>You will </strong>be increasing #whatshemakes by 400 times!  Makers in factories in Bangladesh earn as little as 17c for a garment that takes under 30 minutes to sew. This is the most substantial behaviour change women can make - stop buying fast fashion, which doesn't provide equitable employment for makers, and <strong>be the change you want to see</strong>.</li>
<li>
<strong>You will </strong>be <strong>reducing</strong> the amount of fashion that goes to<strong> landfill</strong>. We've re-engineered the design &amp; production process so that our clothes won't end up in landfill. Unlike fast fashion, where large proportions of every range go straight to landfill when they don't sell.   Our ""just-in-time"" production model means <strong>we don't make dresses that aren't sold </strong>because<strong> </strong>all of our customers buy on-order, rather than on-the-spot.  Almost every other brand uses the ""hit &amp; miss"" model - where the clothes are designed and made before any input is garnered from the customers!!! Think about that.  With our brand, only the design work is done before the garment is <strong>sold to the actual customers</strong> (not buyers or other proxies). If no one likes a design it is NEVER made and can NEVER end up in landfill.  </li>
<li>
<strong>You will</strong> also be supporting Australian made wool producers, as these dresses are made from <strong>environmentally-friendly</strong> 100% Australian made merino wool - a <strong>natural, biodegradable</strong> fibre - and reducing demand for polyester - which is what 60% of the world's clothes are made from and it uses harmful chemicals, including carcinogens, to produce it.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>How Systerly Works</h3>
<ul>
<li>Our makers bootstrap their own production by purchasing a pack that contains everything they need ready for them to simply sew up the dress and send it back for QA.  The pack for this dress costs A$70.</li>
<li>As soon as they return a finished dress (which passes QA) they receive payment of A$140. Most makers will rollover A$70 to purchase another pack - so they need this ""working capital"" to fund their making.</li>
<li>Then we deliver the dress to you, which retails for $210 ($231 with GST). So we make the same amount on the dress as the maker - this covers our overheads - mostly our wages but also the postage for delivery and our small marketing costs. We've worked it out to be as equitable as possible for the makers.</li>
<li>So that is where the money is going - 1/3 for the materials, 1/3 for the maker and 1/3 for the platform running costs.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<ul>
<li>

</div></div>","Angie Finn and Meli Axford are sisters who started Systerly to change how fashion is produced. We're blue collar (our dad was a boiler-maker), good at what we do, hard-working and authentic.  Angie is a fashion designer with a PhD in Fashion and the commercial experience to back it up. Meli is a tech all-rounder who's spent 15 years making startups/building web applications.
 
We're design thinkers with a combined 50 years experience in fashion and tech.We're innovating every aspect of the current outdated, fast fashionproduction processes and we're driving change!
 
Systerly is a platform, not a dress. Our objective is to change the way we make designer fashion that surpasses fast fashion. We connect women who want to buy equitable and sustainable fashion with a network of local makers who work in their own studios, produce quality clothes and are well paid. We're pretty sure we're unique!  
 
To fix Australia (and world) fashion consumers need tovote with their dollarsfor more equitably produced products.  
 
We're innovating and re-engineering every aspect of the design and production process that's currently ""broken"" by leveraging available tech and sustainable fashion practices.  Not only have we completely re-engineered the production process but we're also innovating new sizing techniques, sewing techniques, design techniques - innovation is part of our culture.
For us, fashion sustainability is about job satisfaction and work-life balance for the makers, as much as it is about efficiently using sustainable fabrics. Equity is about getting fairly remunerated for your effort. We've designed this dress to:

suit you;
be made by a qualified maker in their own studio;
from Australian grown and made Merino wool;
for good pay. 

We're doing all of it! ​You can't top that.
 
Our business is designed to equitably enable makers.  We consider ourselves to be makers and have not factored profit into our model because we're happy to just be paid fairly for the work we do and don't want to profiteer.
The more people like you, who care and step up to fix fast fashion, the more local makers we can support.  Once you support the campaign, your contribution will bootstrap a maker onto the platform so they'll be able to earn $70 for each dress they make.  
 

 
What We Need & What You Get
Let's break it down for you:


We need to sell 1000 dresses in order to get 20 makers on the platform with a queue of orders rolling in so we can give the makers a steady stream of work. 

You get an awesome little black dress to wear that you are going to love and that's going to make you feel great every time you wear it because it will remind you that you're doing your bit!
The makers earn a living working at home with their families.

Less fast fashion is produced because ours is slow fashion, that is, we only make a dress once someone buys it.

 

The Impact
This is the difference your contribution will make:

By selling these dresses we'll be able to provide a ""line of credit"" to our qualified makers so they can free up their working capital and order the dress packs on account.  For a maker who is making 10 dresses a week, that's $700 that they would normally need to fund themselves. (You can learn more about how our model works below).

You will be increasing #whatshemakes by 400 times!  Makers in factories in Bangladesh earn as little as 17c for a garment that takes under 30 minutes to sew. This is the most substantial behaviour change women can make - stop buying fast fashion, which doesn't provide equitable employment for makers, and be the change you want to see.

You will be reducing the amount of fashion that goes to landfill. We've re-engineered the design & production process so that our clothes won't end up in landfill. Unlike fast fashion, where large proportions of every range go straight to landfill when they don't sell.   Our ""just-in-time"" production model means we don't make dresses that aren't sold because all of our customers buy on-order, rather than on-the-spot.  Almost every other brand uses the ""hit & miss"" model - where the clothes are designed and made before any input is garnered from the customers!!! Think about that.  With our brand, only the design work is done before the garment is sold to the actual customers (not buyers or other proxies). If no one likes a design it is NEVER made and can NEVER end up in landfill.  

You will also be supporting Australian made wool producers, as these dresses are made from environmentally-friendly 100% Australian made merino wool - a natural, biodegradable fibre - and reducing demand for polyester - which is what 60% of the world's clothes are made from and it uses harmful chemicals, including carcinogens, to produce it.

 

How Systerly Works

Our makers bootstrap their own production by purchasing a pack that contains everything they need ready for them to simply sew up the dress and send it back for QA.  The pack for this dress costs A$70.
As soon as they return a finished dress (which passes QA) they receive payment of A$140. Most makers will rollover A$70 to purchase another pack - so they need this ""working capital"" to fund their making.
Then we deliver the dress to you, which retails for $210 ($231 with GST). So we make the same amount on the dress as the maker - this covers our overheads - mostly our wages but also the postage for delivery and our small marketing costs. We've worked it out to be as equitable as possible for the makers.
So that is where the money is going - 1/3 for the materials, 1/3 for the maker and 1/3 for the platform running costs.

 
Risks & Challenges


We don't reach 1000 dresses: If we don't reach our goal it doesn't matter - the funds are basically funding the dresses - if we only reach 100 dresses we'll make 100 and bootstrap one maker with the funds! 

We don't get enough makers onboard: we need to connect with the right types of makers. Our makers don't need a lot of money to get on the platform - they need a domestic machine, a clean place to make and $70 to buy their first pack. What they do need is competence and the guts to back themselves.  We can't fund their mistakes so they have to do that themselves. 

Makers can't make the dress to our required standard: We mitigate this risk by:


We qualify our makers through our onboarding process. Each maker has to make an initial pack as a test of their ability to satisfactorily make the dress.
Makers have constant access to us through our Systerly Makers' facebook group where we answer questions, resolve issues and share video tips about how to make the dress. 
Iterative design. We've design, made and reworked the design for this dress many times and then tested it with a novice sewer (Meli) and a maker to iron out any problems.


Makers can't make the dress quick enough to earn good pay / won't want to make the dresses as they don't get paid enough: We've mitigated this risk by paying the makers enough to adequately cover making the dress as well as the added cost of handling (ie collect the pack, re-pack and post the completed dress back.  We've made the dress ourselves many times -  Angie can make it in 16 minutes (you can see the timelapse video of this below) and Meli can make it in 25 minutes.

<h3>Hi, I'm Liz!</h3>
<p>Locks of Liz was created after the realization that my true passion was haircare. After working many years in the medical field, and a degree in Biology, it took me time to find my passion which I had been doing on the side all along! I'd like to thank the cancer patients I care for for making me realize not to wait, and that it's never too late.</p>
<p>Launching these Satin Hooded sweaters is the first step in kickstarting my brand which caters to the health and manageability of natural hair via hair care products and accessories. As a woman of color, it is important to me for women to embrace their natural attributes and learn that all hair is ""good hair"" and all hair is manageable. And working with cancer patients has also made me realize, ""it's not JUST hair"".</p>
<p>By contributing to this campaign not only will you help a single mother realize a dream for her and her daughter, but you will be contributing to the greater cause that is self care and self love. I have products in the works for natural hair products in testing phases which are showing amazing results in growth, moisturization, and managebility. I am also working on blueprints for novel curl friendly styling tools.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We'd like to start with 4 style options of our cropped hoodies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Black/Gold with phrase ""These Curls Ain't loyal""</li>
<li>Gray/Black With phrase ""My Curls ARE My Pearls""</li>
<li>Dark Yellow (R251, G204, B52 - Brand color)/Black plain with white logo (left breast)</li>
<li>White/Gold plain with yellow logo (left breast)</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<p>My goal for this campaign is $15,000. About $10,000 will go towards the manufacturing of 100 of each of these sweaters. The remaining $5,000 will go towards my collaboration with a chemist so that I can further improve my home-made products and begin to move them into manufacturing. Shall I exceed my goal, more money will go into creating more sweaters; I have gotten request for full length sweaters and would love to full-fill that for this Fall season.</p>
<p>The perks will range from getting shout outs on my social media for joining me on this journey, to receiving up to TWO sweaters upon production (Est. delivery October 2019). </p>
<p>...And if I don't reach my goal, it will just take longer for me to get these sweaters into the hands of those excited for them, and the selection will be limited. But, I will continue to pursue the purpose of my brand. </p>

<p>At age 17 I became a teenage mom, unable to complete High School I decided to obtain a G.E.D. I attended a vocational school which allowed me to obtain my G.E.D while training for an office job. At 22 while working for a mental health clinic in queens, I decided to go back to school to pursue a career in fashion.</p>
<p>Because I had no background in fashion, I was unable to attend my dream school - The Fashion Institute of technology. I then decided to move to PA and attend a fashion design Program at Lehigh Community College, which taught me the basics of sewing and drawing which would then allow me to apply to the Fashion Institute of technology. Fast-forward 8 years later, I have completed two associates in Fashion design and a BFA at the fashion Institute of technology. I have interned for major brands like Calvin Klein and Tory Burch, I am currently Freelancing for Champion active wear and Kirkland.</p>
<p>While I was growing up I would purposely decide to go outside with pajamas, it was difficult to find clothing that allowed me to feel comfortable and relaxed. Now 15 years later I am still dealing with the same issues, while I won’t go outside wearing my little mermaid pajamas  anymore, I’ve decided to create pieces that offer the PJ's comfort but in a elegant, and functional way. YNA can achieve this by using luxurious fabrics like silks and wools which provide the same comfort pajamas offer. Our inventory will consist of items like - Robes, Kimonos, Jackets, Corsets, Joggers, Hoodies, Skirts, Swimwear, and Bustiers.   </p>
<p>Many other establishments are producing overseas due to high cost. Your contributions will help establish this made in American label, and provide people with casual elegant loungewear.</p>
<p>The cost of developing a brand is certainly steep, we aim to raise about $50,000, which will help cover expenses like luxury fabrics, trims, samples, production, showroom, fitting models, and pop up shop. </p>
<p>The way YNANEWYORK will be thanking Contributors is by offering discounts, post features on our website and VIP guest to pop up shops launch parties. </p>
<p>We hope to reach the goal but in the circumstance that we don’t, we will use the contributions to continue to successfully develop the brand.</p>
<p>The pieces we create or timeless, these are not items that are trend based. These pieces can be worn without a time constraint. Allowing for less disposal and less items in your closet. </p>
<p>New adventures bring hurdles, my life has not been easy and I don’t expect it to be, there’s a lesson in every outcome, the key is to have a positive outlook and learn from your mistakes. My plan is to continue to push forward regardless of the setbacks.</p>

<h3>About This Project</h3>
<p>We are a group of furniture designers and makers in Costa Mesa, California. We started an online business to sell custom made, made to measure, made to order modern furniture at <a href=""https://www.1x1modern.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.1x1modern.com</a>. We developed a set of coat racks that have been inspired by some of the most famous landmark towers in the world, which we hope will be appealing to anybody interested in architecture and design -- hopefully, that's you! We could custom make these coat racks one by one, but we thought that we could make these coat racks available to a much broader audience at a much lower cost by contracting with a larger furniture factory (at <strong>30% less</strong> than custom made price, if we can make the volume commitment).</p>

They are based on real places, events and people. Characters who are brave enough and bold enough to explore unknown places – with a child like sense of adventure and temptation. </p><p>From the beginning we wanted to capture the true heart and soul of the Moomins in our products. Deep, meaningful, relatable but very unique. Tove Janssons graphic illustrations use black and white contrast to show mood.  The darkness and the light, the joy and the fear, the comfort and the unknown - bringing the stories and the characters to life. </p><p>These elements are present in the products we have created. Strong but stylish. Playful but not childish. Bold, graphic and timeless. Street style with a sense of freedom and adventure.</p><p>Just like the Moomins on an adventure in Moominvalley – we wanted to capture the feeling of exploring something or somewhere new.

They are also curious, unusual, mischievous, mysterious and sometimes misunderstood creatures – from an even more mysterious World. We were inspired by the original stories and characters - which capture the imagination of adults as well as children – because they are much deeper and more thought provoking than most. They are based on real places, events and people. Characters who are brave enough and bold enough to explore unknown places – with a child like sense of adventure and temptation. From the beginning we wanted to capture the true heart and soul of the Moomins in our products. Deep, meaningful, relatable but very unique. Tove Janssons graphic illustrations use black and white contrast to show mood.  The darkness and the light, the joy and the fear, the comfort and the unknown - bringing the stories and the characters to life. These elements are present in the products we have created. Strong but stylish. Playful but not childish. Bold, graphic and timeless. Street style with a sense of freedom and adventure.Just like the Moomins on an adventure in Moominvalley – we wanted to capture the feeling of exploring something or somewhere new. The idea that the Moomins are timeless and their stories transcend generations.Be the first to discover the other side of the Moomins. Our accessories are not only stylish, but also functional.

<p>While wearing iShade outdoor, the sun may appear like the moon, as all the glare disappears no matter how strong the sunlight is.</p>
<p>The player gets ready to swing his golf club to hit the golf ball. As he bows down to see the ball, the lenses become clear to allow for better visibility. When the golfer hits the ball and looks up, the iShade darken instantly to protect his vision against the bright sunlight. No more glare of the sun at all.</p>

<p>The girl is moving her head up and down. The light intensity is weak when she bows her head, and so the lenses turn transparent in half a second. When she turns her head up to strong sunlight, the lenses darken via linear stepless technology. The entire process not only super fast but smooth and gentle.</p>

</div>
<div><p align=""left"">What'll happen when face to or away from the sun while wearing iShade?</p></div>
<div>When directly facing the sun, the lenses reach the maximum shade in response to the most intense sunlight. But as you turn away from the sun, the shade also becomes lighter, in response to the decreasing light intensity, until it reaches its minimum. But as you are returning to face toward the sun again, the lens shade will automatically get darker until it reaches the darkest level. So the iShade lens changes its shade in direct proportion to the intensity of the exposed sunlight instantly.All the change within half a second.</div>

<h3>A driver wearing iShade sunglasses</h3>
<p><strong> (Don't miss the important short video here)</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1492281945/lqnflinwjppjtffyev1n.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Basically, iShade has an extremely clear visibility when you are driving, because it's basic color is very light with very high transmittance. This makes it clearer than traditional sunglasses. But as long as the sun appears in front of your vehicles, iShade works to block out the harsh glares and have a clear visibility for your driving.<strong> </strong>Due to the dynamic progressive coloring feature, which makes it more clear than any traditional sunglasses. iShade actually help seeing at a distance and everything will look much clearer even in dim lighting. You can wear them inside a room or a tunnel and still see just fine.  iShade greatly improves your vision. Clearer vision means safer when you drive. <strong>Diamond is valuable, but safety is life.</strong></p>
<p>iShades perfectly synchronizes with the subtle and immediate changes in the lighting environment and many users even don't feel the transition at all. But users can attest to the smart shading technology when they block the chip using their hands and see the discoloration process taking place.</p>
<p>The action above is just for demo and is not recommended for actual use.  </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Driving through the tunnel</strong></h3>
<p>iShade sunglasses become clear and light with visual clarity once the car enters the tunnel. Once the car gets out of the tunnel, the lenses immediately darken according to the light changes in the environment. There's no need to manually take off the glasses or to put them back on.<strong> Less distraction means more safety. Nothing is more important than safety when you drive.</strong></p>

<p> </p>
<h3>Driving into an indoor parking lot.</h3>
<p>You may also experience dimming issues when you're wearing traditional sunglasses and you head into an indoor parking lot. The transition from the road and open sunlight into a dark parking area will cause you to see nothing. It will be so dark that you'll have to take off your traditional sunglasses! But this won't be an issue if you're wearing iShade. <strong>Diamond is valuable, but safety is priceless.</strong></p>

<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Daily Color Change</strong></h3>
<p>The light intensity of the iShade sunglasses depends on the brightness of the surrounding environment. The lenses automatically adjust to the relative brightness on a number of light illumination modes. This is somewhat similar to a parabola.</p>

<p>Hold on for a minute. I have a myopic condition, but can I still wear the iShade? The answer is yes. Though myopic prescription lens is currently limited due to technology, there's still a way to make it work. A prescription adapter is the best solution for wearing your glasses along with iShade.</p>

<p>(The gentleman is wearing iShade with a prescription adapter)</p>
<p><strong>As you can see the superior performance of iShade is unmatched by traditional sunglasses in the marketplace. But what is the key difference between iShade and traditional sunglasses?<br/>We can say, whenever you need a clear vision, iShade is more clear and whenever you need a shade, iShade provide better shading. It's not only high-tech but fashion, practical and high-end which to lead your future eyewear.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>The Sunglasses Revolution </strong></h2>
<p>Sunglasses were invented about a hundred years ago using fixed tints applied to the lenses. Though providing protecting from the glaring sun, sometimes it became too dark to see when the sunlight is weak, and sometimes the strong sunlight causes excessive glare like you're never wearing the sunglasses in the first place. The fact is that the fixed lens dye could not cope with the changing light conditions and the ambient environment. But all of that is about to change.</p>
<p>Enter the iShade smart tinting sunglasses. It is a subversive product in the field of eyeglasses. iShade adapt to the amount of sunlight you're seeing and automatically changes the lens' dye. The result is a revolutionary feature that allows the wearer the best visibility under the sun at all times. </p>

<h3>The Working Principle of iShade Sunglasses.</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1493256681/kpwboj72sngllxi22obf.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>(Look! The basic color of the lenses are very light with extremely high transmittance, which are clear indoors and darken outdoors.)</p>
<p>Combining smart chip technology with self-tinting lenses. Powering each iShade sunglasses is a specially-made, energy saving smart chip made by the company. The solar chips are environmentally friendly, uses solar energy and more importantly, allows for the changing of the lens tint in as little as half a second. The driving principle behind it is a light theory based on electric tensions which adjust the lens via responsive transmittance. The stronger the sun, the darker the lens and vice versa. You need only one pair of sunglasses for all seasons and all weather conditions. You won't have to manually switch your sunglasses from on to off, or vice versa- the adjusting is done for you. All you need to do is to relax!</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>WHY iShade? </strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Your Other Premium Sunglasses Can't Compare</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>List of Features:</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Completely Intelligent</strong></p>
<p>It looks no different from traditional sunglasses. Replace battery with solar energy and automatic transition without a switch, completely intelligent.</p>
<p><strong>0.5-Second Reaction Tinting Speed</strong></p>
<p>Photochromic lens darkens when it detects UV rays in about 10 to 20 seconds while changing from dark to light in a few minutes. But the reaction rate of iShade for changing the tint is half a second. The lenses change by themselves during the synchronization process. </p>
<p><strong>Dynamic Progressive Coloring</strong></p>
<p>When there is no sunlight, the basic color of lens is very light.When there is sunlight, the change of tint starts at the top and transition to the bottom. The lenses always appear darker at the top than at the bottom. Due to the sun always above the eyes, this makes visibility much better and the shading effect to work more excellently than any traditional sunglasses.</p>
<p><strong>Linear Stepless Coloring</strong></p>
<p>The most amazing innovation is the tinting linear stepless discoloration feature, which added an unprecedented level of comfortability to the sunglasses wearer. The discoloration process and the transition is so smooth that your eyes won't feel the transition at all.</p>
<p><strong>Car-Sensitive Coloring</strong></p>
<p>iShade works best when you're driving during the day. With it, you can block out the bright sunlight and have a much more clear visibility even when the sun is in front of the car. Glare problems disappear and you can concentrate on driving safely on the road.</p>
<p><strong>Ultra Light Weight</strong><br/>Traditional sunglasses usually weighs 25-45 grams,but iShade smart tinting sunglasses weights only 23 grams. Despite all these features, Ishade is even lighter than traditional sunglasses.</p>

<h3><strong>Team Story</strong></h3>
<p>Ever wonder how iShade smart tinting sunglasses came to be? Let us tell you the whole story.</p>
<p>Michael Xiao used to be a salesman selling sunglasses in Southern California for many years. It was his job to drive around every day to meet his customers. One major problem he had was actually facing the strong glare of the Southern Californian sun as he drove from one city to another. It reached a tipping point when Michael almost had an accident because he couldn't see where he was going!</p>
<p>Sure, he was wearing sunglasses. But that sometimes had no effect, especially in the face of the blinding sun. The lenses were simply not capable of diffusing the strong sunlight. When the sun is weak, the shades were simply too dark. Michael began thinking how much his life as a driver and as a salesman would improve if there was a way to make an ""intelligent"" sunglasses...</p>
<p>So in 2006, Michael entered a venture with his younger brother Tony about developing iShade. After 2 years of hard work and research, the first prototypes were produced. It made use of LCD senses and batteries to change the color of the lenses. Then, the team encountered their first problem- the lens was flat, it was heavy and a button had to be pressed for the lens to change color.</p>
<p>Both inventors thought about making things simpler. The ideal smart sunglasses of the future will have to be flexible and have curved LCD lenses. Instead of batteries, kinetic and solar energy were to be used to achieve maximum innovation. But alas, the technology and the materials to make this possible were simply not available during the time. </p>
<p>It wasn’t until curved lenses were mass-produced for e-book readers and high-end smartphones that the iShade finally took shape. 2010, Darren and Ben, two young and promising chip experts joined our team.  </p>
<p>We gave up the original design and everything back to the drawing board. We contacted the best lens manufacturers and worked closely with them. After numerous of failures, and the future looked good. The iShade underwent major technological and design changes. The switch that operated the dimming was replaced by a smarter solar-powered chip. The flat lens was discarded in favor of the curved variety, which is an amazing story in itself. Overall, a new solar chip module controls the whole process. The chip set a default intensity of 3000 Lux, which changes colors appropriately in 0.5 seconds. </p>
<p>Fast forward to 2017 and we have the new iShade to thank for. It is the newest technology in the field of eyeglasses. We'd love to take this opportunity to give thanks to all of our friends and our avid supporters, and to our future supporters in this innovative endeavor. We hope that with added backing we can push this product to the market so that sunglasses users and drivers will enjoy the benefits it can bring. Our mission is to produce top-notch sunglasses that are made with the highest standards. This is our gift to our beloved investors.</p>

<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Risks and Challenges</strong></h3>
<p>At first glance, iShade smart sunglasses look very much like the future of tinted shades, but the technology powering it is relatively straightforward and simple. The parts that make up the whole is the control module, the flexible LCD lens, and the plastic frame. All of these can be produced under a controlled environment.</p>
<p>One of the most notable challenges encountered was the production of satisfactory flexible LCD lenses. Flexible liquid crystal displays that go in e-book readers, high-end smartphone screens and other electronics are so in demand that if we were to order now, it would take approximately five months to be delivered. This is a double-edged sword that can go both ways. If the supply is short, then some of the product deliveries will have to be postponed.</p>
<p>The good news is that all the lens factory we visited know the selling potential of our products. There should be a strict time frame to ensure successful deliveries. If all goes as planned, the order of iShade will be shipped and arrive well before Christmas time. </p>
<p>You'll be sure to appreciate the product when the next hot summer months come. There's a use for it even in the colder months- use it as you ski down slopes for unparalleled visibility!</p>
<p>We'd love to take this opportunity to thank all of our current backers. We'd love to have this groundbreaking product be available as soon as possible to help all sunglasses users and drivers on the road. Your support means the world to us. Without it, such an innovative product would never have existed. Our goal is to perfect the iShade with great improvements and invaluable advice.</p>
<p>Again, thank you for your incredible support!</p>

<h3><strong>FQAs</strong></h3>
<p>Q: Who can use iShade?</p>
<p>A: Drivers can use iShade to improve their safety on the road. The sun glare is disappeared and you can concentrate on driving. People can use iShade as they undertake their favorite outdoor activity. The benefits of smart sunglasses far outweigh that of traditional sunglasses. All in all, whenever you need a clear view, iShade is more clear and whenever you need a shade, iShade provides better shading. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q: How does iShade change colors and under what conditions?</p>
<p>A: There are two essential factors that make it happen- start light and saturation illumination. Start luminance creates the minimum lens discoloration. When light is measured at 3,000 Lux, the lens will start to change. Saturation illumination will try to achieve the darkest lens illumination. If the light is measured at 50,000 Lux, then the lens will achieve the darkest saturation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q: Why do you use the slower 0.5-second discoloration time frame when there's, say 0.1 discoloration speed?</p>
<p>A: It's all about not triggering the lens flicker phenomenon. Setting the discoloration speed to 0.1 seconds will cause the smart lens to flicker and cause a distraction. Setting it at a slower 0.5 seconds will not trigger the flicker effect.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q: How long can iShade last?</p>
<p>A: It's roughly the same as the lifespan of smart watches, smartphones and any product that has electronic components installed within.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q: How do I clean the iShade?</p>
<p>A: It's best not to touch the smart lens directly in order for it to be as clear as possible. You can use appropriate cleaning methods much like you would traditional sunglasses.</p>

And thanks for a warm letter from Chicago (Don't miss the most important short video here) Dear Tony,I Loved the sunglasses that you gave me. The 26hr drive back to Chicago was made so much easier because of those glasses. For example, I would start my drive before dawn and drove straight into the sunrise. The sunglasses made driving in the sun easy to do because they were dark enough to keep my eyes focused on the road. They were also comfortable, I know because I had them on for Hours. But they were not too dark because when I went into truck stops I did not need to remove the glasses as things were real clear.Thanks Clayton4th April 2017  
A boy wearing iShade sunglasses (Don't miss the 15 seconds short video here)

Here’s a boy at a game wearing iShade sunglasses on a sunny day. Watch as he turns towards the sun, the lenses transition to its darkest shade, as he turns towards the shadows, the lenses appear more and more transparent.

A golfer wearing iShade sunglasses
 
While wearing iShade outdoor, the sun may appear like the moon, as all the glare disappears no matter how strong the sunlight is.
The player gets ready to swing his golf club to hit the golf ball. As he bows down to see the ball, the lenses become clear to allow for better visibility. When the golfer hits the ball and looks up, the iShade darken instantly to protect his vision against the bright sunlight. No more glare of the sun at all.
Here is Torrey Pines Golf Course in La Jolla, California of USA,  interviewing is currently taking place...

A girl wearing iShade sunglasses  
(Don't miss the 10 seconds short video here)


The girl is moving her head up and down. The light intensity is weak when she bows her head, and so the lenses turn transparent in half a second. When she turns her head up to strong sunlight, the lenses darken via linear stepless technology. The entire process not only super fast but smooth and gentle.


 
iShade discoloration process

(Don't miss the 20 seconds short video here)


 


What'll happen when face to or away from the sun while wearing iShade?
When directly facing the sun, the lenses reach the maximum shade in response to the most intense sunlight. But as you turn away from the sun, the shade also becomes lighter, in response to the decreasing light intensity, until it reaches its minimum. But as you are returning to face toward the sun again, the lens shade will automatically get darker until it reaches the darkest level. So the iShade lens changes its shade in direct proportion to the intensity of the exposed sunlight instantly.All the change within half a second.
 
A driver wearing iShade sunglasses
 (Don't miss the important short video here)

Basically, iShade has an extremely clear visibility when you are driving, because it's basic color is very light with very high transmittance. This makes it clearer than traditional sunglasses. But as long as the sun appears in front of your vehicles, iShade works to block out the harsh glares and have a clear visibility for your driving. Due to the dynamic progressive coloring feature, which makes it more clear than any traditional sunglasses. iShade actually help seeing at a distance and everything will look much clearer even in dim lighting. You can wear them inside a room or a tunnel and still see just fine.  iShade greatly improves your vision. Clearer vision means safer when you drive. Diamond is valuable, but safety is life.
iShades perfectly synchronizes with the subtle and immediate changes in the lighting environment and many users even don't feel the transition at all. But users can attest to the smart shading technology when they block the chip using their hands and see the discoloration process taking place.
The action above is just for demo and is not recommended for actual use.  
 
Driving through the tunnel
iShade sunglasses become clear and light with visual clarity once the car enters the tunnel. Once the car gets out of the tunnel, the lenses immediately darken according to the light changes in the environment. There's no need to manually take off the glasses or to put them back on. Less distraction means more safety. Nothing is more important than safety when you drive.

 
Driving into an indoor parking lot.
You may also experience dimming issues when you're wearing traditional sunglasses and you head into an indoor parking lot. The transition from the road and open sunlight into a dark parking area will cause you to see nothing. It will be so dark that you'll have to take off your traditional sunglasses! But this won't be an issue if you're wearing iShade. Diamond is valuable, but safety is priceless.

 
Daily Color Change
The light intensity of the iShade sunglasses depends on the brightness of the surrounding environment. The lenses automatically adjust to the relative brightness on a number of light illumination modes. This is somewhat similar to a parabola.

 
Powerful Polarized Lens
Is iShade Polarized?
The answer is yes, definitely. But how do we prove it?

Here's a simple experiment to convince you.
(Don't miss the 15 seconds short video here)



Here are two pairs iShade sunglasses. When you put the lens on top of each other, it darkens.
Here is a polarizing test card. Put iShade in front of the test card, the hidden fish pattern will be displayed. 


 
iShade, also for myopic group
 

Hold on for a minute. I have a myopic condition, but can I still wear the iShade? The answer is yes. Though myopic prescription lens is currently limited due to technology, there's still a way to make it work. A prescription adapter is the best solution for wearing your glasses along with iShade.
iShade with Prescription Adapter
Behold, the add-on prescription adapter for those who have myopic conditions. The operation and installation are super easy!

(The gentleman is wearing iShade with a prescription adapter)
As you can see the superior performance of iShade is unmatched by traditional sunglasses in the marketplace. But what is the key difference between iShade and traditional sunglasses?We can say, whenever you need a clear vision, iShade is more clear and whenever you need a shade, iShade provide better shading. It's not only high-tech but fashion, practical and high-end which to lead your future eyewear.
 
The Sunglasses Revolution 
Sunglasses were invented about a hundred years ago using fixed tints applied to the lenses. Though providing protecting from the glaring sun, sometimes it became too dark to see when the sunlight is weak, and sometimes the strong sunlight causes excessive glare like you're never wearing the sunglasses in the first place. The fact is that the fixed lens dye could not cope with the changing light conditions and the ambient environment. But all of that is about to change.
Enter the iShade smart tinting sunglasses. It is a subversive product in the field of eyeglasses. iShade adapt to the amount of sunlight you're seeing and automatically changes the lens' dye. The result is a revolutionary feature that allows the wearer the best visibility under the sun at all times. 

 
The Working Principle of iShade Sunglasses.

(Look! The basic color of the lenses are very light with extremely high transmittance, which are clear indoors and darken outdoors.)
Combining smart chip technology with self-tinting lenses. Powering each iShade sunglasses is a specially-made, energy saving smart chip made by the company. The solar chips are environmentally friendly, uses solar energy and more importantly, allows for the changing of the lens tint in as little as half a second. The driving principle behind it is a light theory based on electric tensions which adjust the lens via responsive transmittance. The stronger the sun, the darker the lens and vice versa. You need only one pair of sunglasses for all seasons and all weather conditions. You won't have to manually switch your sunglasses from on to off, or vice versa- the adjusting is done for you. All you need to do is to relax!
 
WHY iShade? 
Your Other Premium Sunglasses Can't Compare
List of Features:
Completely Intelligent
It looks no different from traditional sunglasses. Replace battery with solar energy and automatic transition without a switch, completely intelligent.
0.5-Second Reaction Tinting Speed
Photochromic lens darkens when it detects UV rays in about 10 to 20 seconds while changing from dark to light in a few minutes. But the reaction rate of iShade for changing the tint is half a second. The lenses change by themselves during the synchronization process. 
Dynamic Progressive Coloring
When there is no sunlight, the basic color of lens is very light.When there is sunlight, the change of tint starts at the top and transition to the bottom. The lenses always appear darker at the top than at the bottom. Due to the sun always above the eyes, this makes visibility much better and the shading effect to work more excellently than any traditional sunglasses.
Linear Stepless Coloring
The most amazing innovation is the tinting linear stepless discoloration feature, which added an unprecedented level of comfortability to the sunglasses wearer. The discoloration process and the transition is so smooth that your eyes won't feel the transition at all.
Car-Sensitive Coloring
iShade works best when you're driving during the day. With it, you can block out the bright sunlight and have a much more clear visibility even when the sun is in front of the car. Glare problems disappear and you can concentrate on driving safely on the road.
Ultra Light WeightTraditional sunglasses usually weighs 25-45 grams,but iShade smart tinting sunglasses weights only 23 grams. Despite all these features, Ishade is even lighter than traditional sunglasses.

Team Story
Ever wonder how iShade smart tinting sunglasses came to be? Let us tell you the whole story.
Michael Xiao used to be a salesman selling sunglasses in Southern California for many years. It was his job to drive around every day to meet his customers. One major problem he had was actually facing the strong glare of the Southern Californian sun as he drove from one city to another. It reached a tipping point when Michael almost had an accident because he couldn't see where he was going!
Sure, he was wearing sunglasses. But that sometimes had no effect, especially in the face of the blinding sun. The lenses were simply not capable of diffusing the strong sunlight. When the sun is weak, the shades were simply too dark. Michael began thinking how much his life as a driver and as a salesman would improve if there was a way to make an ""intelligent"" sunglasses...
So in 2006, Michael entered a venture with his younger brother Tony about developing iShade. After 2 years of hard work and research, the first prototypes were produced. It made use of LCD senses and batteries to change the color of the lenses. Then, the team encountered their first problem- the lens was flat, it was heavy and a button had to be pressed for the lens to change color.
Both inventors thought about making things simpler. The ideal smart sunglasses of the future will have to be flexible and have curved LCD lenses. Instead of batteries, kinetic and solar energy were to be used to achieve maximum innovation. But alas, the technology and the materials to make this possible were simply not available during the time. 
It wasn’t until curved lenses were mass-produced for e-book readers and high-end smartphones that the iShade finally took shape. 2010, Darren and Ben, two young and promising chip experts joined our team.  
We gave up the original design and everything back to the drawing board. We contacted the best lens manufacturers and worked closely with them. After numerous of failures, and the future looked good. The iShade underwent major technological and design changes. The switch that operated the dimming was replaced by a smarter solar-powered chip. The flat lens was discarded in favor of the curved variety, which is an amazing story in itself. Overall, a new solar chip module controls the whole process. The chip set a default intensity of 3000 Lux, which changes colors appropriately in 0.5 seconds. 
Fast forward to 2017 and we have the new iShade to thank for. It is the newest technology in the field of eyeglasses. We'd love to take this opportunity to give thanks to all of our friends and our avid supporters, and to our future supporters in this innovative endeavor. We hope that with added backing we can push this product to the market so that sunglasses users and drivers will enjoy the benefits it can bring. Our mission is to produce top-notch sunglasses that are made with the highest standards. This is our gift to our beloved investors.

Risks and Challenges
At first glance, iShade smart sunglasses look very much like the future of tinted shades, but the technology powering it is relatively straightforward and simple. The parts that make up the whole is the control module, the flexible LCD lens, and the plastic frame. All of these can be produced under a controlled environment.
One of the most notable challenges encountered was the production of satisfactory flexible LCD lenses. Flexible liquid crystal displays that go in e-book readers, high-end smartphone screens and other electronics are so in demand that if we were to order now, it would take approximately five months to be delivered. This is a double-edged sword that can go both ways. If the supply is short, then some of the product deliveries will have to be postponed.
The good news is that all the lens factory we visited know the selling potential of our products. There should be a strict time frame to ensure successful deliveries. If all goes as planned, the order of iShade will be shipped and arrive well before Christmas time. 
You'll be sure to appreciate the product when the next hot summer months come. There's a use for it even in the colder months- use it as you ski down slopes for unparalleled visibility!
We'd love to take this opportunity to thank all of our current backers. We'd love to have this groundbreaking product be available as soon as possible to help all sunglasses users and drivers on the road. Your support means the world to us. Without it, such an innovative product would never have existed. Our goal is to perfect the iShade with great improvements and invaluable advice.
Again, thank you for your incredible support!

<h3>What is Pouch Puppies?</h3>
<p>Pouch Puppies is the sports tank top with a front pouch that <strong>comfortably hugs your puppy</strong> with your warmth everywhere you go, while allowing you to go about your day as usual.</p>
<p>You can take your pups shopping, rock climbing, bike riding and so many other recreational activities. Just don't go doing cartwheels or handstands because we didn't fit them with seatbelts!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1591071576/xa1bkudyrnzjmu1uoyvp.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<h3> </h3>
<p> </p>
<h3>What makes it awesome?</h3>
<p>The specialty <strong>fur repellant fabric</strong> has a perfect amount of strength and stretch in it, which allows you to place your puppy in the front pouch without damaging the top. It can hold up to 10kg in weight. The materials used are a premium polyester/spandex mix with a <strong>breathable </strong>weave keeping the wearer and the puppy cool. </p>
<p>The <strong>fashionable</strong> <strong>razor-back style</strong> shape of the top <strong>distributes the weight of your puppy evenly throughout your back</strong>, allowing you to wear this for hours on end with complete comfort.</p>
<p>It even <strong>reduces anxiety in dogs </strong>as it hugs them with perfect compression as if they're being held in your arms. </p>
<p>This top changes the way we interact with our puppies by keeping them closer to us for longer with little to no change in whatever daily task we are completing.</p>

<p> </p>
<h3>Where it started</h3>
<p>We started pouch puppies accidentally when one day Mel was doing some house work and decided to wear another tshirt on top of the one she was already wearing and place her puppy in between to carry it around. Before we knew it, sketches were being drawn and and idea was born!</p>
<p>When we originally pieced this together it looked like a sack on the front of the singlet and we knew no one in their right mind would wear it. After speaking with some fashion stylists we were able to come up with a sports tank top that not only looked amazing but was extremely comfortable to wear.</p>

<h3><strong>This isn't our first rodeo</strong></h3>
<p>Mel contacted Blake who is a digital marketing guru to take this product and make it great.</p>
<p>Blake and his agency Happy Hippo Media control the sales and marketing for highly successful companies with some making as much as $500k/month from their marketing capabilities.</p>
<p>Happy Hippo Media have had experience with startups before and know how to build beautiful brands at scale. They only takes on projects they really love and this is something they describe as ""exciting as Ben &amp; Jerry's ice cream"".</p>

<p>Anxiety in dogs is a common condition nowadays and can be resolved with love and time spent with their owners. Puppies absolutely love it and we want puppy parents around the world to share the same experience.</p>

<h3>Welcome to Oracle Jayne Station </h3>
<p>Oracle Jayne Station is named after the street in Tucson, Arizona where my father grew up, where I got to spend part of my summer vacations. On the ranch at the edge of the Sonora Desert, my family taught me to appreciate the plants and animals we'd interact with. To this day, I still remember the smells of my grandmother's mud room, the scents from my grandfather's medicine cabinet, and the aromas of the desert after it rained. </p>
<p>After working as a makeup artist for 17 years, I know that fragrances have long been marketed based on emotions and experiences. Rarely do they actually have anything to do with either. What’s inside the bottle usually has very little from the natural world or any authentic heritage. Oracle Jayne Station challenges all that.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What does the signature scent smell like?</h3>
<p>My signature scent,<i> El Arroyo,</i> is inspired by the smell of the desert after it rains, and the sight of the creek running behind my grandparents ranch. This is the first luxury fragrance to containing a spectrum of the chaparral plant aromas. Also known as greasewood or creosote, this hearty Sonoran Desert shrub was previously thought to be an impossible to distill plant. Two different innovative and entirely natural processes collect the extract and distill the essential oil, resulting in a ""multifaceted"" fragrance that changes with each breath. On its own, the greasewood shifts between subtly sweet, gently floral, woodsy like cedar, cooling like eucalyptus, and spicy green like wasabi. El Arroyo combines greasewood with snakeweed, myrrh, and several other botanicals to create a unique and welcoming fragrance that changes from moment to moment.</p>

</div><div> </div></div>","Welcome to Oracle Jayne Station 
Oracle Jayne Station is named after the street in Tucson, Arizona where my father grew up, where I got to spend part of my summer vacations. On the ranch at the edge of the Sonora Desert, my family taught me to appreciate the plants and animals we'd interact with. To this day, I still remember the smells of my grandmother's mud room, the scents from my grandfather's medicine cabinet, and the aromas of the desert after it rained. 
After working as a makeup artist for 17 years, I know that fragrances have long been marketed based on emotions and experiences. Rarely do they actually have anything to do with either. What’s inside the bottle usually has very little from the natural world or any authentic heritage. Oracle Jayne Station challenges all that.
 
What does the signature scent smell like?
My signature scent, El Arroyo, is inspired by the smell of the desert after it rains, and the sight of the creek running behind my grandparents ranch. This is the first luxury fragrance to containing a spectrum of the chaparral plant aromas. Also known as greasewood or creosote, this hearty Sonoran Desert shrub was previously thought to be an impossible to distill plant. Two different innovative and entirely natural processes collect the extract and distill the essential oil, resulting in a ""multifaceted"" fragrance that changes with each breath. On its own, the greasewood shifts between subtly sweet, gently floral, woodsy like cedar, cooling like eucalyptus, and spicy green like wasabi. El Arroyo combines greasewood with snakeweed, myrrh, and several other botanicals to create a unique and welcoming fragrance that changes from moment to moment.
El Arroyo is suitable for all genders.

  The flexible wire allows the speaker to wrap comfortably around your ear, and makes it fully adjustable.Apart from being hygienic, this also prevents intense sound waves from hitting your eardrum directly and potentially causing hearing impairment.  Other Headsets: Sound isolating earphones close off your ears, raising humidity and creating a perfect petri dish for bacteria. In this short term this leads to itching. In the long term it can cause serious health problems.     NEOPON is not only the most comfortable, but also the smartest hands-free headset ever.We’ve developed a set of smart applications that turns NEOPON into your personal A.I Assistant. To ramp up the volume, simply add an extra ear tip and channel the sound.   NEOPON connects to your smartphone or computer using Bluetooth LE. It works perfectly with AI assistants like Siri, OK Google and Cortana.We've also developed an Android app that truly takes advantage of the fact that you can wear NEOPON all day long. Our app uses text to speech to keep you updated on who's calling, your text messages, social media updates and your schedule.   The battery lasts all day long, and recharges in just one hour.NEOPON comes with up to 130 hours standby life, 6 hours talking time, and 5 hours of wireless music streaming on a single charge.    Support us now and be the first to receive NEOPON for 40% off the retail price.  For all backers, we will provide four different types of eartips.  WE NEED NEOPON!WE NEED NEOPON!WE NEED NEOPON!WE NEED NEOPON!WE NEED NEOPON!WE NEED NEOPON! NEOPON is Best Hands-Free for Everybody!  As a lover of music and a lifelong learner, I’ve suffered through uncomfortable earphones to listen to my favorite bands, and to lectures and audio books, since I was in middle school.Unfortunately these bad earphones damaged my ears and caused hearing loss. So I set out to create a safe, always comfortable headset that I could wear all day.By training I’m a mechanical designer and technician. I’ve spent 10 years of my career focused on factory automation.My co-founder spent years at Samsung’s smartphone division in the Middle East, and is focused full time on sales and establishing our channel partnerships.We have received $200,000 in government funding to help us out through the initial R&D stage. In 2016, we were named one of the Most Promising Electronic Gadgets at the China Daily Innovation Awards.  Now, we’re ready to mass produce the product.We already have an agreement in place with a manufacturer in Shenzhen, but a successful Indiegogo campaign will help us prove our market demand and thus secure more investments and mass pre-orders.A highly successful indiegogo campaign will also help us secure the fundings and time we need to continue the development of our next lineup in the coming years.   We plan to complete the campaign by the end of February, and immediately begin the manufacturing process.We aim to deliver the first batch of NEOPON to all our Indiegogo supporters by March. NEOPONMost Promising Electronics Gadget< China Daily Innovation Awards >Sophie YAN, CHINA DAILY ReporterNEOPON products MAKE YOUR ORDER NOW!",37.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>Hi guys! My name is Coy Stites, I am a full time hair stylist, with 3 years behind the chair. Recently switching over to booth renting and being my own boss really unleashed my boss attitude and the light bulb went off and i knew what i needed to do. Starting a company has always been my dream, especially if its gonna help so many in the industry i owe my life to.</li>
<li>This campaign is helping to fund my dream to help my fellow stylists in saving money by not ruining everything we own in bleach.</li>
<li>This campaign goal is to makeup the difference in creating this line. I saved up for years and can fund most of it myself, however this last chunk will jumpstart and speed up the process in getting these clothes ready to buy for you guys.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>This money will go directly into the business, funding fabric sourcing, the design process, the prototype stages, and if i can raise enough, even more stock so its available to more people who want them.</li>
<li>Now the perks are for you guys as a thank you and my appreciation of any dollar i get. I want to get very personal with the people supporting me and my brand, which is why instead of physical items that will be thrown away or kept in a drawer to be forgotten, i chose to make the perks personal with me, including you guys in the process and what goes on behind the scenes. if you have any ideas for future perks please let me know!</li>
<li>Whether i don't reach the goal or surpass it, every dime will go into making sure this is the highest quality i can possibly make it while keeping it reasonable priced. Even if we sell out of the first launch, i plan on putting that into more designs, more stock, more sizes, more color choices, just growing every aspect of this brand.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul><li>I noticed a gap in the market that wasn't being tapped into, at least in the USA, of cute bleach proof clothing. I have only seen anything bleach proof once and it was a plain black t-shirt. So i decided to change that myself and offer varieties of clothing, for men and women eventually, so we can look cute for our clients as well as protect where our money is going and not throwing it away when we get a stain or looking less professional because our clients see a giant orange stain.</li></ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<ul>
<li>I have never done anything like this so we will all be learning together. I have already learned so much in these last few months researching that i never knew. I know this is gonna be a challenge, but if you know me, I do what i have my mind set on, one way or another. I wont back down from a challenge.</li>
<li>Fortunately, i am working with a wonderful company who sees my vision and has been helping to guide me and let me have executive control. They have decades experience in the clothing industry, hundreds of fabric connections, and a manufacturing plant in the U.S.A. I speak with the president themselves and i trust she sees what i see for my company and has been very receptive to anything i had to say. I truly am blessed to have been connected with them.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<ul><li>If you cant donate, please just share this everywhere! A share to me is worth just as much, get the word out there. Thank you so much already!</li></ul>

I have never done anything like this so we will all be learning together. I have already learned so much in these last few months researching that i never knew. I know this is gonna be a challenge, but if you know me, I do what i have my mind set on, one way or another. I wont back down from a challenge.
Fortunately, i am working with a wonderful company who sees my vision and has been helping to guide me and let me have executive control. They have decades experience in the clothing industry, hundreds of fabric connections, and a manufacturing plant in the U.S.A. I speak with the president themselves and i trust she sees what i see for my company and has been very receptive to anything i had to say. I truly am blessed to have been connected with them.

<p><strong>ABOUT ZELUS LONDON</strong></p>
<p>ZELUS LONDON™ is an apparel designer, manufacturer, and retailer based in London, United Kingdom. Taking inspiration from artists and thought leaders like Jiri Thyn, Ido Portal and Alan Watts, the brand stands for simplicity. All our garments are designed to create the perfect balance between function and form. Our popular t-shirts are created with Nanoflex, a bespoke performance fabric made to fit like your own skin, while being soft, stretchy and breathable. </p>
<p>Now, we are proud to present our latest brainchild, the Nighthawk jacket. We have teamed up with expert suppliers from around the world to craft a new, functional bomber jacket for urban living. The features of this jacket have been carefully curated to streamline your everyday city experience without adding bulk. </p>
<p>We believe that simplicity has the power to enhance your performance: there’s a reason that Einstein rotated five identical suits and Steve Jobs never deviated from his iconic black turtleneck and jeans. It has been proven again and again that the burden of decision-making wears you down. By minimising lower-order decision-making, energy is conserved for the things that really matter. </p>
<p>The Nighthawk jacket was created to streamline your focus by lifting the burden of tiny everyday stressors: deciding what to wear, the feeling of dread when you can’t find your credit card, tangled earphone clumps. At ZELUS LONDON, we believe that simplicity is the ultimate form of sophistication. That’s why we think that Apple’s chief designer, Jonathan Ives, had it right when he said that ‘design is at its best and its most empowering when it simply disappears.’</p>
<p>We hope that Nighthawk appeals to you, the city dwellers that it was created for. Your support will allow us to continue to create streamlined, innovative and beautiful clothing, including a women’s line and winter jacket. </p>

ROAME Zeros' have seamlessly integrated turn signal and brake light technology which wirelessly connect to your motorcycle. Motorcycle shoes should be safe, but they shouldn’t have to be uncomfortable, bulky, inconvenient, and unfashionable.We’ve spent the last three years designing the ultimate motorcycle shoe, so you can ride safely without giving up comfort and style. The ROAME Zeros are designed to be a motorcycle shoe that fits into your everyday life.By using the newest technology for impact protection, integrating electronics for enhanced rider visibility, and re-thinking the way shoes are made, the ROAME Zeros are everything a motorcycle shoe should be. 
   The ROAME Zeros are a fusion of safety and fashion. An emphasis on a casual look, increased comfort, and hidden technology set the Zeros apart from all motorcycle shoes that have come before it.The fact that most of the safety features are hidden was one of the reasons why we called this shoe the “Zeros”. When it comes to developing our product, we made Zero compromises. Finally, total freedom! You don’t have to choose between safety and comfort anymore.We feel you should be able to be free of constraints when it comes to motorcycle footwear. The Zeros are a high top shoe that blurs the lines between performance and casual wear. These lightweight shoes are designed for all-day riding, comfort, and performance without cutting corners. The longer you ride, the more you realize the importance of motorcycle gear. Certainly our helmets, jackets, boots and gloves have become far more than just safety gear, but a part of our motorcycle lifestyle. Where does it say that motorcycle gear has to be inconvenient and unstylish? The ROAME Zeros are here to redefine what motorcycle safety should look like.With the ROAME Zeros we wanted to create a shoe that would offer motorcycle safety while complementing your lifestyle. Remember, it’s not if you’ll crash but when. If you ride long enough, you will go down. You need make sure you’re wearing the right gear to protect yourself when this happens.First, add our small transmitter box to your motorcycle's existing turn signal/brake light system, then pair the shoes with this box. Once the shoes have been paired with this transmitter box, all you have to do is get on your bike and start riding.

<p>Designed to be comfortable, aesthetically pleasing, and innovative in every little detail. We are proud to move the standards in men’s underwear forward, and increase the level of comfort and functional design. These boxer briefs go down the leg to mid-thigh and are designed to stay in place with a bind. Smart materials and luxury design = VanJohan. </p>

<p>When we say we don’t complicate things, we truly mean it. We noticed that underwear tags cause chaffing, so we decided to <b>remove the tag</b> from our underwear and haven’t looked back since. By doing this, we reduce chaffing, material, and manufacturing steps all at once. </p>

<p>There used to be a time that clothing lasted a good amount of years. Nowadays most gear is of low quality and made by cheap labor under bad conditions. Put your mind at ease as w<b>e guarantee a fair product</b> in all aspects.</p>
<p>Our goal at VanJohan is to create a sustainable product line. Creating a high quality garment that is guaranteed to last longer than your average pair. In our manufacturing process, we’ve adopted <b>Flatlock Stitching</b>, a technique used to enhance comfort by eliminating chaffing caused by traditional solutions. </p>

VanJohan is the only underwear brand with a unique support system that gives you a bolder look while preventing sticking, itching, and odor. VanJohan outperforms in situations where you are sitting all day long, working out at the gym, or just standing in your underwear. 
The luxury underwear brand is designed to be extremely comfortable and fit ALL body types. VanJohan stays classy and uncomplicated without compromising on quality, to bring you the comfort and confidence you deserve.  

 
Feel confident walking around in just your underwear.
  
 
Have the courage to present yourself when it matters. Be bold!
 
 
Feel comfortable in any situation and show your true spirit. Get out there!
 
 
No matter how active your day is, you can always count on your VanJohan’s. Don’t sweat it!
 

 
Your comfort and confidence is important to us. At VanJohan, we are committed to delivering a fit for regular men. Our design is made with the understanding that regular men come in all different shapes and sizes, and their comfort and fit shouldn’t be compromised.
  

Women are no strangers to the power of imagination when it comes to underwear. Let us help you feel Bold and Sexy when strutting around in just your briefs.
We can’t guarantee overall package performance, but we can guarantee overall package appearance and comfort!
 
It's not cheating when it's all you. Lift up, look sharp.
  
You’re on a date, she picks a long walk on the beach of course. It’s hot out, and you know at some point your male parts are going to shift and get stuck to your leg, or even worse get shifted up and squashed by your waistband. You’re now left worrying about how you’re going to “wiggle” out of this situation without her noticing. 
This is anything but comfortable and is exactly what VanJohan is designed to prevent. We created a comfortable ‘hammock-area’ for your crown jewels to rest without worry. We call this the Package booster™, which enhances lift on your overall package appearance.
 
PackageBooster™ keeps everything where it should be, and looks good doing it. Best wing-man ever!
One size fits none. Offering a wide range of sizes from Small to Extra Large. VanJohan is crafted to fit your body the way underwear is supposed to. The package booster also allows showers, growers and modest men alike, to enjoy a snug and secure fit. 
 
Avoid shrinkage. No 'George Costanza' moments when outside in the cold. Feel good... or look great at least.
  

Much like relationships, trust is important. Same goes with underwear! It is the most intimate piece of clothing you wear. VanJohan is a brand you can trust to keep your valuables safe, secure, and fresh all day long. 
We’ve all had those days that have lasted longer than we’re comfortable with. The anti-bacterial qualities in our fabrics prevent bad odors and allow you to relax knowing your package is taken care of.
 
We wouldn’t want to stick our nose in your business, but when you are rocking a pair of VanJohan underwear can you blame us? Tell your next date about this wonderful feature and see what happens. *Wink wink*
   
Talking about getting things wet. There’s nothing sexy about sweat stains. With the use of our moisture-wicking material, you can stay fresh, dry and clean all day long.
 
Beat the heat, show your confidence and don’t let them see you sweat.
   
 
The key to life is to stay breezy.
  

Designed to be comfortable, aesthetically pleasing, and innovative in every little detail. We are proud to move the standards in men’s underwear forward, and increase the level of comfort and functional design. These boxer briefs go down the leg to mid-thigh and are designed to stay in place with a bind. Smart materials and luxury design = VanJohan. 
  
When we say we don’t complicate things, we truly mean it. We noticed that underwear tags cause chaffing, so we decided to remove the tag from our underwear and haven’t looked back since. By doing this, we reduce chaffing, material, and manufacturing steps all at once. 
 
Reducing chafing, material and manufacturing steps all at once.
  
Without a tag, you might assume it will be difficult to identify our brand. Fear not, we’ve thought this out. Our soft feel waistband comfortably hugs your body while proudly displaying the VanJohan Logo. Display your confidence and our brand with honor.
 
Display your confidence and our brand with honor.
 

There used to be a time that clothing lasted a good amount of years. Nowadays most gear is of low quality and made by cheap labor under bad conditions. Put your mind at ease as we guarantee a fair product in all aspects.
Our goal at VanJohan is to create a sustainable product line. Creating a high quality garment that is guaranteed to last longer than your average pair. In our manufacturing process, we’ve adopted Flatlock Stitching, a technique used to enhance comfort by eliminating chaffing caused by traditional solutions. 

    
When it came to designing our underwear, we discovered the smartest way of improving the quality, comfort and durability would be to choose the right materials. Our underwear is made up of highly beneficial and sustainable products, and by doing this we not only create the underwear you’ve been waiting for, but the environmental impact is far lower compared to conventional underwear production.

I remember hearing about the Haiti Women's team trying to qualify for World Cup only to not have enough money for the taxi. Then, when they got some funds they gave them to Trinidad/Tobago who needed money for food. There are a lot of these stories for women's soccer. These stories clicked inside my brain, and I thought I'd come up with a way to give back - so a percentage of profits will be donated to the Women's Soccer Program in the country where our product is being made.

Their Artisan Cooperative will be making our beanies with yarn they had donated from Calvin Klein - definitely re-use sourcing. Based on a design chosen by YOU through social media, the women came up with a knit pattern to match. We have photos of the first prototype and are awaiting samples to sew on our woven label to brand it as a Soccer Girl product. We've worked into our costs the shipping from Haiti and paying Fair Trade wages

The Impact
 Here's our mission you'll be supporting: Our mission is to promote women’s soccer around the world and empower ladies of all ages to play and enjoy the game for a healthy and positive path in life.  We strive to empower females by making products that have the most impact possible for women in soccer countries where we can make a difference to the women’s game and the women who live there. We choose to use our bottom line for good and believe in creating value for society by merging buying power and financial success with standards of Fair Trade and environmental responsibility. 
    Risks & Challenges  The challenges to this project come with my chosen slow method of doing business and working with sometimes rural and remote communities. This could mean we're slower to offer new products or there could be delays in shipping.   I'm a great troubleshooter and will work at making the logistics work for everyone, and I'm all about communication, so just email if you have questions or concerns.     Other Ways You Can Help Some of you can't contribute financially, but please contribute to the dream of Soccer Girl by helping us spread the word:  Please make some noise about the campaign! Get loud like you're watching your fave team play. Let everyone know you're cheering for us.

<br/><div>At GadgetBox, we discovered that the number of entrepreneurs who launch their products is increasing at a very rapid pace. As a result of this, consumers are not able to fully experience and engage in new products and technology that is swarming the globe. In order to resolve this, we created GadgetBox. GadgetBox is a tech-based subscription box service that helps both sides of the equation (consumers and entrepreneurs) close the gap and be connected more directly.</div>

We allow entrepreneurs to gain maximum exposure for their product(s) through our service that sends subscription boxes to our subscribers on either a monthly, quarterly, or yearly basis. These subscription boxes will contain a certain amount of tech &amp; design gadgets that will be received by the subscriber via postal mail. They will not be randomized entrepreneurial based products. These products will be hand picked by the GadgetBox team in order to match the preferences of the subscriber as closely as possible. We have a technique made specifically to allow us to garner greater insight regarding the preferences of the subscriber. <div><br/></div>

As a result of this, consumers are not able to fully experience and engage in new products and technology that is swarming the globe. In order to resolve this, we created GadgetBox. GadgetBox is a tech-based subscription box service that helps both sides of the equation (consumers and entrepreneurs) close the gap and be connected more directly.


We aim to bridge the gap between household consumers and entrepreneurs using our unique subscription box service. We allow entrepreneurs to gain maximum exposure for their product(s) through our service that sends subscription boxes to our subscribers on either a monthly, quarterly, or yearly basis. These subscription boxes will contain a certain amount of tech & design gadgets that will be received by the subscriber via postal mail. They will not be randomized entrepreneurial based products. These products will be hand picked by the GadgetBox team in order to match the preferences of the subscriber as closely as possible. We have a technique made specifically to allow us to garner greater insight regarding the preferences of the subscriber. 












The products in the boxes will be provided by entrepreneurs that we partner with, therefore allowing household consumers to be aware of the new and unique innovations that are swarming the globe. This subscription box service vastly mitigates the dilemma that entrepreneurs face when they want to properly expose their products to household consumers.

 Furthermore, household consumers like me and you will be able to discover new gadgets and tech products that are making life easier all over the globe!











Through our website, household consumers and entrepreneurs will be able to create a free account and consumers will be able to subscribe to our subscription box service. Just look for the Sign Up button located on the top right corner

But after the first box came all my doubts were erased. I mean I got a 3D printing pen in the first box--that's amazing!"" --Noah A, Subscriber

<h2>  <b>ENGLISH &amp; </b>FRANÇAIS
</h2>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h2><b>Description / Définition :</b></h2>
<p></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">          DOORAK
is a high-end clothing brand that draws its roots from an ideology combining
both: potentialities, fairness, prospecting, self-overcoming and beyond all the
quest for innovation. It is thus a concept that associate the ""who can to
whom wants"" thereby combining the action to thought. When we say DOORAK,
we imply: ""Have the attitude ... keep the altitude""</p>
<blockquote><p style=""text-align: justify;"">          DOORAK
est une marque de vêtements haut de gamme qui tire sa source d'une idéologie
combinant à la fois : potentialités, équité, prospection, surpassement de soi
et au-delà de tout, la quête de l’innovation. Il s’agit ainsi d’un
concept qui associe” le qui peut au qui veut” mariant de ce fait l’action à la
pensée. Qui dit DOORAK dit : ""Ayez l’attitude... gardez l’altitude)..</p></blockquote>
<ul><li><h2><b>The story of the project / L'histoire du projet :</b></h2></li></ul>
<p>          My
name is Serbelloni LOYEM, promoter of the DOORAK brand. Born into a modest
family, I quickly aspired after my Marketing studies, to be an actor in the
economy. I hoped not only to support myself, but also to work my way up to Fair
Trade and job creation in the fashion world. Originally, I wanted to create a
large garment clothing workshop; The majority of young specialized in fashion
in Africa in general and in Cameroon in particular (my home country), fail to
blend in professionally by lack or insufficiency of the fashion business.</p>
<blockquote style=""text-align: justify;"">
<p>          Je
suis Serbelloni LOYEM, promoteur de la marque DOORAK. Issue
d'une famille modeste, j'ai très vite ambitionné après mes études de Marketing,
d'être un acteur de la vie économique. L'espoir, non seulement de subvenir au
mieux à mes besoins, mais aussi d'œuvrer à ma façon pour un commerce Équitable
dans la mode et pour la création d'emploi. A l'origine, je souhaite créer
un grand atelier de confection vestimentaire; La majeure partie de
jeunes spécialisés dans la mode en Afrique en général et au Cameroun en
particulier (mon pays d'origine), ne parviennent pas à s’insérer
professionnellement par manque ou insuffisance d'entreprises de
mode. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>          In the same track,
Cameroon is a producer country of cotton, silk, leather, wool and other
materials needed for the manufacture of clothing. More than one craftsmen
encounter difficulties in the sale or export of their finished products (silk
fabrics, leather ...).So, I had to find a way, not only to create jobs, but
also to promote Fair Trade.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">          Dans
le même sillage, le Cameroun, est un Pays producteur de coton, de
soie, de cuir, de laine et bien d'autres matières nécessaires à la
fabrication des vêtements. Plus d’un  des artisans rencontrent énormément
de difficultés pour la vente ou l’exportation de leurs produits finis
(toiles de soie, le cuir…). Il me fallait absolument trouver un moyen, non
seulement de créer de l'emploi, mais aussi de favoriser un Commerce Équitable.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1434053617/w7xfafudqxqdgysezv5q.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

</blockquote>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""></p>
<p>         The
project was ambitious, but most of all required substantial financial
resources. From 2003, I have started the quest of personal financings by taking
many small jobs that I associated as best I could to my evening studies.. A
year later, the result was not conclusive. Despite the difficulties
encountered, I believed and I remained unshaken because I felt and I knew that
this project was viable. Having scrutinized several additional tracks, I
realized that it was necessary to go through a side project that will serve me
as a springboard for the implementation of my clothing workshop. Hence the idea
of a clothing brand that adheres better with a clothing workshop, furthermore,
it was a perfect fit with my educational background.</p>
<blockquote style=""text-align: justify;""><p>          Le
projet ambitieux, mais surtout nécessite des moyens financiers
conséquents. Dès 2003 je me lance dans la quête des
financements personnels à travers de nombreux petits emplois que
j’associe tant bien que mal à mes études en cours du soir. Un an plus
tard, le résultat n'est pas probant. Malgré les difficultés rencontrés,
j’y ai cru et je suis resté inébranlable   car je sentais et je
savais que ce projet était viable. Après avoir scruté plusieurs pistes
supplémentaires, je réalise qu'il est nécessaire de passer par un projet
secondaire qui me servira de tremplin pour  l'implantation de mon atelier de
confection. D’où l’idée d'une marque de vêtements en ce sens qu’elle
adhérait mieux avec un atelier de confection, de plus, elle était en
parfaite adéquation avec ma formation scolaire. <br/></p></blockquote>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""></p>
<p>          So I decided to create the DOORAK brand as my
own image; that is to say a brand that marries perseverance, faith in its
potentialities and goals. In the same logic, I decided to immigrate in France
in 2004 in the hope of finding a more favorable framework for the project. The
brand formalizes in 2006. A new challenge begins, because it is not just about
creating clothing workshops in Africa, but it is also about succeeding in
developing a clothing line in France facing tough competition. The beginnings
were extremely difficult; I had to find various partners that had to be
compensated, and I did not have the means. I was therefore compelled to follow
a self-taught training in different areas. I managed thereby to launch in 2007
a collection of T-shirts. The product was appreciated but sales did not take
off. After study, I came to the conclusion that it would be an advantage to
stand out to distinguish myself. So, I took a break in 2008 to prepare for my
next move.</p>
<blockquote style=""text-align: justify;""><p>          Je
décide alors de créer la marque DOORAK à mon
image; c’est-à-dire qui marine  persévérance, foi en ses
potentialités et ses objectifs. Dans la même logique, je décide d'immigrer en
France en 2004 dans l'espoir de trouver un cadre plus favorable à ce
projet. La marque s'officialise en 2006. C'est un nouveau défi qui
commence, car il n'est plus seulement question de créer des ateliers de
couture en Afrique, mais il faut aussi réussir à le développer une
ligne de vêtement en France face à une rude concurrence. Les
débuts sont extrêmement difficiles; il fallait trouver des
partenaires divers qu’il fallait rémunérer, et je n’avais pas
les moyens pour. Je me trouve donc contraint de suivre une formation
en autodidacte dans différents domaines. Je parviens de ce
fait à lancer en 2007 une collection de
tee-shirts. Le produit est apprécié mais les ventes ne décollent pas.
Après étude, j’en arrive à la conclusion selon laquelle il
faudrait se d'avantage se démarquer pour se distinguer. Je marque alors
une pause en 2008 pour me préparer.  <br/></p></blockquote>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""></p>
<p>          The
brand returns to the front of the scene in March 2015 with luxury caps that
meet a very favorable response from the fanatics of this accessory. These are
the users who prefer a soaked product with an unusual touch. The growing
success leads to new demands such as T-shirts, Jackets, Trousers, Dresses,
Handbags, Shoes ...</p>
<p>This
demand forces us to expand our range to satisfy all parties. However, it faces
financial barriers that prevent us from continuing in our tracks. Hence our
presence on this website to share with you the experience by seeking financial
support.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>          La
marque revient sur le devant de la scène en Mars 2015 avec des
casquettes de luxe qui rencontrent un écho très favorable auprès des
fanatiques de cet accessoire. Il s'agit des utilisateurs préférant un
produit imbibé d’une touche hors du commun. Le succès grandissant entraine
des nouvelles demandes telles que : Tee-shirts, Vestes, Pantalons, Robes, Sacs
à main, Chaussures … </p>
<p>Ce besoin
nous oblige à étendre notre gamme afin de satisfaire toutes les parties.
Cependant, on se heurte à la barrière financière qui nous empêche de continuer
dans notre élan. D’où notre présence sur ce site pour partager avec vous
cette expérience qui se veut la nôtre et par là solliciter un soutien
financier de votre part.</p>

<h4>The competition :</h4>
<p>
</p>
<p>The fashion is a highly competitive market, it would be of
which very difficult to forge a place and to maintain it.  However we made a deep analysis on this
matter and the best way of resisting in the face of the competition is to be
always faithful to our strategic line;  Our
purpose is not the quantity, but the quality and especially in the respect for
the fair trade.  For DOORAK, It is the
ethical, then the Earnings. it would be of what very difficult for the other
brands to respect this strategy.</p>

Le succès croissant de la marque à travers le monde peux entraîner une très

<h2><b>WHY
THIS PROJECT IS IMPORTANT ?</b></h2>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">- The
target market is European in general and French in particular. Rising
unemployment is </p>
<p>undeniable;
Many stylists, model makers, graphic designers, models<span>  from major French or European schools do
not  have the chance to work in major
fashion companies. Furthermore, any consumer would wand a high-end clothing,
with quality and reasonable price.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">-
Cameroon (example of an African Country) is a producer country of cotton, silk,
leather, wool and other materials for making clothes ... Moreover, about 95% of
qualified young people in this field have no uncorked for lack or insufficiency
of garment enterprises. The minimum wage is 25,000 CFA francs; the equivalent
of about 42$ per month. The RSA or equivalent does not exist. Therefore the
majority of young graduates are left on their own. More than one craftsmen
encounter difficulties for fair marketing products related to fashion.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">DOORAK
presents itself as a new chance, a new career opportunity, a new breath to the
economic weapon, a powerful vector of purchasing power through products
designed, developed by French youth, made by French and African young people,
presented by French and Africans models and sold around the world; all in a
logic of fair trade.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul><li><h2><b>POURQUOI CE
PROJET EST IMPORTANT ?</b></h2></li></ul>
<p align=""justify"">- Le marché
visé est Européen en général, et Français en particulier. La montée du chômage
y est indéniable; bon nombre de dessinateurs, de stylistes, modélistes,
infographistes,  mannequins tous issus des grandes écoles
Françaises ou Européennes n’ont pas toujours la même chance de vivre de
leur savoir-faire dans les grandes sociétés de mode. Par ailleurs,
tout consommateur souhaiterait avoir un vêtement haut de gamme, de qualité et
ce à prix raisonnable.</p>
<p align=""justify"">- Le Cameroun
(exemple de Pays Africain) est un Pays producteur de coton, de soie, de cuir,
de laine et bien d'autres matières nécessaires à la fabrication des
vêtements... Par ailleurs, environ 95% des jeunes qualifiés du domaine n'ont
aucun débouché par manque ou insuffisance d'entreprises de confection. Le
Smic est de 25 000 FCFA; l’équivalent d'environ 38 € par mois. Le RSA, ou
l’équivalent n’existe pas. Par conséquent la majeure partie des
jeunes diplômés sont livrés à eux-mêmes. Plus d’un  des artisans y
rencontrent des difficultés pour une commercialisation équitable des produits
lié à la mode.</p>
<p align=""justify"">          DOORAK
se présente donc comme une nouvelle chance, une nouvelle opportunité de

Description / Définition :

          DOORAK
is a high-end clothing brand that draws its roots from an ideology combining
both: potentialities, fairness, prospecting, self-overcoming and beyond all the
quest for innovation. It is thus a concept that associate the ""who can to
whom wants"" thereby combining the action to thought. When we say DOORAK,
we imply: ""Have the attitude ... keep the altitude""
          DOORAK
est une marque de vêtements haut de gamme qui tire sa source d'une idéologie
combinant à la fois : potentialités, équité, prospection, surpassement de soi
et au-delà de tout, la quête de l’innovation. Il s’agit ainsi d’un
concept qui associe” le qui peut au qui veut” mariant de ce fait l’action à la
pensée. Qui dit DOORAK dit : ""Ayez l’attitude... gardez l’altitude)..
The story of the project / L'histoire du projet :
          My
name is Serbelloni LOYEM, promoter of the DOORAK brand. Born into a modest
family, I quickly aspired after my Marketing studies, to be an actor in the
economy. I hoped not only to support myself, but also to work my way up to Fair
Trade and job creation in the fashion world. Originally, I wanted to create a
large garment clothing workshop; The majority of young specialized in fashion
in Africa in general and in Cameroon in particular (my home country), fail to
blend in professionally by lack or insufficiency of the fashion business.

          Je
suis Serbelloni LOYEM, promoteur de la marque DOORAK. Issue
d'une famille modeste, j'ai très vite ambitionné après mes études de Marketing,
d'être un acteur de la vie économique. L'espoir, non seulement de subvenir au
mieux à mes besoins, mais aussi d'œuvrer à ma façon pour un commerce Équitable
dans la mode et pour la création d'emploi. A l'origine, je souhaite créer
un grand atelier de confection vestimentaire; La majeure partie de
jeunes spécialisés dans la mode en Afrique en général et au Cameroun en
particulier (mon pays d'origine), ne parviennent pas à s’insérer
professionnellement par manque ou insuffisance d'entreprises de
mode. 

          In the same track,
Cameroon is a producer country of cotton, silk, leather, wool and other
materials needed for the manufacture of clothing. More than one craftsmen
encounter difficulties in the sale or export of their finished products (silk
fabrics, leather ...).So, I had to find a way, not only to create jobs, but
also to promote Fair Trade.

          Dans
le même sillage, le Cameroun, est un Pays producteur de coton, de
soie, de cuir, de laine et bien d'autres matières nécessaires à la
fabrication des vêtements. Plus d’un  des artisans rencontrent énormément
de difficultés pour la vente ou l’exportation de leurs produits finis
(toiles de soie, le cuir…). Il me fallait absolument trouver un moyen, non
seulement de créer de l'emploi, mais aussi de favoriser un Commerce Équitable.








         The
project was ambitious, but most of all required substantial financial
resources. From 2003, I have started the quest of personal financings by taking
many small jobs that I associated as best I could to my evening studies.. A
year later, the result was not conclusive. Despite the difficulties
encountered, I believed and I remained unshaken because I felt and I knew that
this project was viable. Having scrutinized several additional tracks, I
realized that it was necessary to go through a side project that will serve me
as a springboard for the implementation of my clothing workshop. Hence the idea
of a clothing brand that adheres better with a clothing workshop, furthermore,
it was a perfect fit with my educational background.
          Le
projet ambitieux, mais surtout nécessite des moyens financiers
conséquents. Dès 2003 je me lance dans la quête des
financements personnels à travers de nombreux petits emplois que
j’associe tant bien que mal à mes études en cours du soir. Un an plus
tard, le résultat n'est pas probant. Malgré les difficultés rencontrés,
j’y ai cru et je suis resté inébranlable   car je sentais et je
savais que ce projet était viable. Après avoir scruté plusieurs pistes
supplémentaires, je réalise qu'il est nécessaire de passer par un projet
secondaire qui me servira de tremplin pour  l'implantation de mon atelier de
confection. D’où l’idée d'une marque de vêtements en ce sens qu’elle
adhérait mieux avec un atelier de confection, de plus, elle était en
parfaite adéquation avec ma formation scolaire. 

          So I decided to create the DOORAK brand as my
own image; that is to say a brand that marries perseverance, faith in its
potentialities and goals. In the same logic, I decided to immigrate in France
in 2004 in the hope of finding a more favorable framework for the project. The
brand formalizes in 2006. A new challenge begins, because it is not just about
creating clothing workshops in Africa, but it is also about succeeding in
developing a clothing line in France facing tough competition. The beginnings
were extremely difficult; I had to find various partners that had to be
compensated, and I did not have the means. I was therefore compelled to follow
a self-taught training in different areas. I managed thereby to launch in 2007
a collection of T-shirts. The product was appreciated but sales did not take
off. After study, I came to the conclusion that it would be an advantage to
stand out to distinguish myself. So, I took a break in 2008 to prepare for my
next move.
          Je
décide alors de créer la marque DOORAK à mon
image; c’est-à-dire qui marine  persévérance, foi en ses
potentialités et ses objectifs. Dans la même logique, je décide d'immigrer en
France en 2004 dans l'espoir de trouver un cadre plus favorable à ce
projet. La marque s'officialise en 2006. C'est un nouveau défi qui
commence, car il n'est plus seulement question de créer des ateliers de
couture en Afrique, mais il faut aussi réussir à le développer une
ligne de vêtement en France face à une rude concurrence. Les
débuts sont extrêmement difficiles; il fallait trouver des
partenaires divers qu’il fallait rémunérer, et je n’avais pas
les moyens pour. Je me trouve donc contraint de suivre une formation
en autodidacte dans différents domaines. Je parviens de ce
fait à lancer en 2007 une collection de
tee-shirts. Le produit est apprécié mais les ventes ne décollent pas.
Après étude, j’en arrive à la conclusion selon laquelle il
faudrait se d'avantage se démarquer pour se distinguer. Je marque alors
une pause en 2008 pour me préparer.  

          The
brand returns to the front of the scene in March 2015 with luxury caps that
meet a very favorable response from the fanatics of this accessory. These are
the users who prefer a soaked product with an unusual touch. The growing
success leads to new demands such as T-shirts, Jackets, Trousers, Dresses,
Handbags, Shoes ...
This
demand forces us to expand our range to satisfy all parties. However, it faces
financial barriers that prevent us from continuing in our tracks. Hence our
presence on this website to share with you the experience by seeking financial
support.

          La
marque revient sur le devant de la scène en Mars 2015 avec des
casquettes de luxe qui rencontrent un écho très favorable auprès des
fanatiques de cet accessoire. Il s'agit des utilisateurs préférant un
produit imbibé d’une touche hors du commun. Le succès grandissant entraine
des nouvelles demandes telles que : Tee-shirts, Vestes, Pantalons, Robes, Sacs
à main, Chaussures … 
Ce besoin
nous oblige à étendre notre gamme afin de satisfaire toutes les parties.
Cependant, on se heurte à la barrière financière qui nous empêche de continuer
dans notre élan. D’où notre présence sur ce site pour partager avec vous
cette expérience qui se veut la nôtre et par là solliciter un soutien
financier de votre part.






THE NUMBERS :Our total requirement =  19 252$ Available = 3 962$Your help = 15 290$

LES CHIFFRES :

Votre aide : 13 500€


IF THE OBJECTIVE IS EXCEEDED :
With the surplus amount, we are going to begin the setting-up of the 
workshop in Africa near craftsmen and to create the first jobs.
SI L'OBJECTIF EST DÉPASSÉ :
Avec le montant excédant, nous allons commencer 
l’implantation de l'atelier de fabrication en Afrique près des artisans 
et créer les premiers emplois


RISKS AND CHALLENGES:


As any activity, we cannot ignore the possible risks.


The competition :


The fashion is a highly competitive market, it would be of
which very difficult to forge a place and to maintain it.  However we made a deep analysis on this
matter and the best way of resisting in the face of the competition is to be
always faithful to our strategic line;  Our
purpose is not the quantity, but the quality and especially in the respect for
the fair trade.  For DOORAK, It is the
ethical, then the Earnings. it would be of what very difficult for the other
brands to respect this strategy.

WHY
THIS PROJECT IS IMPORTANT ?
- The
target market is European in general and French in particular. Rising
unemployment is 
undeniable;
Many stylists, model makers, graphic designers, models  from major French or European schools do
not  have the chance to work in major
fashion companies. Furthermore, any consumer would wand a high-end clothing,
with quality and reasonable price.
-
Cameroon (example of an African Country) is a producer country of cotton, silk,
leather, wool and other materials for making clothes ... Moreover, about 95% of
qualified young people in this field have no uncorked for lack or insufficiency
of garment enterprises. The minimum wage is 25,000 CFA francs; the equivalent
of about 42$ per month. The RSA or equivalent does not exist. Therefore the
majority of young graduates are left on their own. More than one craftsmen
encounter difficulties for fair marketing products related to fashion.
DOORAK
presents itself as a new chance, a new career opportunity, a new breath to the
economic weapon, a powerful vector of purchasing power through products
designed, developed by French youth, made by French and African young people,
presented by French and Africans models and sold around the world; all in a
logic of fair trade.

POURQUOI CE
PROJET EST IMPORTANT ?
- Le marché
visé est Européen en général, et Français en particulier. La montée du chômage
y est indéniable; bon nombre de dessinateurs, de stylistes, modélistes,
infographistes,  mannequins tous issus des grandes écoles
Françaises ou Européennes n’ont pas toujours la même chance de vivre de

          DOORAK
se présente donc comme une nouvelle chance, une nouvelle opportunité de
carrière, un nouveau souffle à l’ arme économique, un vecteur puissant du
pouvoir d'achat à travers des produits conçus, élaborés et dessinés par des
jeunes Français, confectionnés par des jeunes Africains et Français, présentés
par des mannequins Français et Africains et vendus dans le monde entier;
le tout dans une logique du commerce équitable.

</h3> <p>In 2014, Coney, Nate and I started Rice Love with an idea from my mom to recycle jute rice bags by sewing them into bags. We tested some designs and people loved them. We also wanted to give away the rice that was once inside to families in need. <br/></p>
<p>In February 2015, we traveled to Coney's home country of India to give away rice. It was amazing to see what a little extra rice could do for a family in India. With 20 kilos of extra rice, families had extra money to accomplish some of the things they needed.</p>
<p>Giving away rice was exciting and rewarding! We made sure to buy the high quality rice at retail rather than finding the cheapest rice we could and buying in bulk. This way, we supported the local economy from farmer all the way down to the smallest local retailer. The little extra money that a family has was spent in their community, stimulating the local economy.<br/></p>
<p>We are on Indiegogo to raise money to launch a new line of recycled bags, build an ecommerce site, and to begin exhibiting at trade shows. <br/></p>
<p>We want Rice Love to grow so that we can do more good! We need your support. Please buy a bag and spread the word.<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>Rice Love makes stylish products that have the look and feel of authentic burlap rice bags. <b>In the future, these bags will retail for more than they are listed for during this campaign.</b> Be part of the Rice Love history and pledge today! </p>

</div></div>","Rice Love - Buy a bag. Feed a Family
 In 2014, Coney, Nate and I started Rice Love with an idea from my mom to recycle jute rice bags by sewing them into bags. We tested some designs and people loved them. We also wanted to give away the rice that was once inside to families in need. 
In February 2015, we traveled to Coney's home country of India to give away rice. It was amazing to see what a little extra rice could do for a family in India. With 20 kilos of extra rice, families had extra money to accomplish some of the things they needed.
Giving away rice was exciting and rewarding! We made sure to buy the high quality rice at retail rather than finding the cheapest rice we could and buying in bulk. This way, we supported the local economy from farmer all the way down to the smallest local retailer. The little extra money that a family has was spent in their community, stimulating the local economy.
We are on Indiegogo to raise money to launch a new line of recycled bags, build an ecommerce site, and to begin exhibiting at trade shows. 
We want Rice Love to grow so that we can do more good! We need your support. Please buy a bag and spread the word.
  What We Need & What You Get Rice Love makes stylish products that have the look and feel of authentic burlap rice bags. In the future, these bags will retail for more than they are listed for during this campaign. Be part of the Rice Love history and pledge today! 
Recycled Pencil Case $10

Recycled Hip Pack $15

Recycled Re-usable Shopping Bag $25


Recycled Messenger Bag $25
Recycled Back Pack $35



    The Impact Your contribution makes a huge impact! Not only do you get a unique bag, but it represents love:  For each bag bought, a kilo of rice will be donated to a family in need in Nepal (except for the pencil case).
 We are a successful team. We aren't like others supposed ""do-gooders"". We love doing good. We are happy to get out there and do it. We don't have layers of bureaucracy that waste precious dollars. You're money will get to the people.
    Risks & Challenges Naturally, production can be full of challenges. Does Rice Love have what it takes to overcome them? These materials will be manufactured in the neighboring state of Nepal. We know the import process and cost. We have a proven track record of success. You can rest assured that if the project goal is met, you will receive your reward! We thank you for placing your confidence in us!

<p></p>
<p>We designed every single part of the watch (except the internal movement) ourselves. The attached photos show the different stages of development in the overall process before we were 100% happy with the design.</p>
<p>When conceptualising our product we used our two 3D printers to print the different cases we were considering. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442018686/pydckco4fxxyqa4onet2.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>This is where our 3D printing our prototypes proved invaluable:</p>
<ol>
<li>We were able to minimise costs by 3D printing all our favourite designs before deciding on the winner.</li>
<li>We did extensive development in the ergonomics of the casing to ensure it would be comfortable for both mens and women's wrist sizes. This meant optimizing the weight distribution and wall thickness.</li>

<p>When deciding on a name for our brand, one of
the areas of our research was the history of denim and how it has become to be
a staple of people’s wardrobes. There are various stories as to how and from where
denim originated and subsequently rose to prominence but one such tale caught
our eye. </p>
<p>We drew inspiration from an Italian general from the 1800s, Giuseppe
Garibaldi. One day Garibaldi faced an uphill battle where the odds were completely stacked against him. Seeing that this could have been his last battle he decided to throw tradition out the window and wear whatever he wanted, which turned out to be a pair of blue pants. </p>
<p>He won this battle and became a cult hero around the world, and so began the trend of wearing blue pants,
which would later evolve into lighter versions of denim. We believe the name
Garibaldi fits our brand perfectly as it promotes doing your own thing,
starting something new, and fearless approach to life.</p>

<h3>Risks and Challenges</h3>
<div>
<p></p>
<p>With any project comes risks and challenges. These issues can occur during the development, production, and/or logistical aspects of the project. When making products molds can break, materials can be swapped, and imperfections can be missed during quality control. When shipping goods packages get damaged, packages can be lost, and certain countries will levy large duties even for a small order.</p>
<p>Basically, things can happen that are out of our control but we are confident we have the skills and existing industry knowledge to mitigate any potential risks. We enjoy excellent and longstanding relationships with our suppliers and one of the original founders of Garibaldi Watches will be onsite at the manufacturing centres throughout the campaign and production cycle to ensure the highest quality and standards are met. </p>
<p>We have everything in place to launch our product line and the means to correct anything that might go wrong . Most important, we will continue to be transparent throughout the campaign, and also into production and beyond if Garibaldi Watches is funded. If you have any specific questions about our campaign, our products, or our brand please ask us directly and we will continue to update the answers to the FAQ.

</div>
<br/><h3>FAQ</h3>
<div><b>Q: Can I pledge to get more than one watch at a certain level?</b></div>
<div>A: Of course you can! For each additional watch you want, simply add on another pledge amount to your current pledge. For example, if you're in at the $125 level, add an extra $125 for each additional watch. If you want two watches at that pledge amount, you'd pledge $250.</div>
<div><b>Q: When can I select my watch of choice?</b></div>
<div>A: We will be sending out our official survey once our project ends. You will then be able to select your watch and give us your correct shipping instructions.</div>
<div><b>Q: What type of stainless steel do you use for the watches?</b></div>
<div>A: Garibaldi Watches use a high quality 316 Low Carbon Grade stainless steel that looks and feels great.</div>
<div><b>Q: What type of movement is used?</b></div>
<div>A: Both our 42mm and 38mm watches use Japanese Miyota Precision Quartz movements, which are world renowned for being accurate and reliable. Our 42mm watch includes the date function while our minimalist 38mm watch does not.</div>
<div><b>Q: Is the watch waterproof?</b></div>
<div>A: It's water <i>resistant </i>meaning it's fine to wear when in the rain or washing the dishes. On the other hand if you're off scuba diving leave it at home.</div>
<div><b>Q: What is the warranty on the watch?</b></div>
<div>A: One Year Manufacturers Guarantee on the movement of our watches. Unfortunately, the warranty does not cover damages that may occur from everyday wear and tear.</div>
<div><b>Q: When will my card be charged?</b></div>
<div>A: All cards will be charged <b>after</b> time has ran out on the campaign. You should see a charge on your account 3-5 days after the campaign ends.</div>
<div><b>Q: When will my watch be shipped?</b></div>
<div>A: Manufacturing is standing by! If and when we’re successfully funded and our campaign ends we will put the order in. We expect to have all watches shipped out by December 2015 - just in time for Christmas!!</div>

</div></div>","At Garibaldi Watches we strive to be the bridge between high-luxury and streetwear.
We are a brand for creatives embracing a lifestyle where you pursue your true goals. We’re designers, photographers, chefs, street artists, athletes, musicians, DJ's, fixie enthusiasts, surfers, entrepreneurs, skaters and more.
Our watches are the first ever to have premium Japanese selvedge denim on the dial.


Why Selvedge Denim?

These days, selvedge denim has become more desirable than non-selvedge for two reasons: 
1) The nuance of the denim weaving technique itself  
2) The commitment to quality from the mills producing selvedge denim. 
Japanese selvedge denim has a reputation among denim enthusiasts as being the best in the world and for good reason. Japanese denim is known for its premium construction and the skilled, artisanal craft required to make it, which is why we have chosen it for our watches.




We are initially offering two watch lines:

42mm Men's Watch (6 Styles)




38mm Unisex Minimalist Watch (4 Styles)




All materials are handpicked and each and every strap handmade to make sure every detail is according to our demands. 







Our Clasp



Our double-locking deployment clasp allows you to easily fit the watch to your wrist. Whether you like to wear it tight or to wear it slightly loose, this clasp lets you do it all. Once it's fitted you will never need to adjust it again. 



This type of deployment clasp is typically found on watches in the luxury segment, which is why we are particularly proud of being able to equip each of our watches with one minus the exorbitant price tag.




Our Selvedge Denim

What do Evisu, Samurai, Momotaro Jeans,
Japan Blue and Garibladi Watches have in common? Quality.
We source our denim from the same town
where these denim powerhouses are based, Kojima.

When selecting the denim, 2 things were important:
1) Color
2) Weight. 

Color and texture are what make our watches truly unique. We needed a denim that was light enough to be embossed on a strap while also being able to fit through our deployment clasp. This was not an easy task but we are very happy with the outcome and we know you will be too!


Our Strap



Our straps are made with a combination of genuine leather and Japanese selvedge denim. The leather underside gives extreme comfort while each of our shorter straps has the iconic red-and-white selvedge stitching on one edge for a subtle but head-turning look.



Our philosophy is simple - style and quality doesn't have to cost a fortune. 



We look to give the following:


AFFORDABILITY: Starting at just $89 on Indiegogo. We work direct to consumer, passing the savings to you with radical transparency.

PRACTICALITY: We wanted a quality handmade watch useful enough for everyday wear. Simply, a no frills watch that just makes sense.

DESIGN: So many watches these days look the same. Seriously where has the creativity gone? Our hope is that you will appreciate just how much time we spend on the design of the watches to make them instantly recognizable and evocative.






In order for the Garibaldi Watch project to reach fruition, we need to raise $10,000 to fund initial manufacturing costs with the ability to scale through more orders. 

Our minimum order quantity for our selvedge denim is HIGH and considering we have 4 colours of denim it means we need to sell a large number of units to cover this. This is where you come in!

Through Indiegogo, backers will receive wholesale pricing (up to 53% discount), be the first to wear the new watch collection, and become ambassadors of the brand.





From now until the end of our campaign (September 22), you can refer your friends to receive additional Garibaldi watches in your choice of style or color for FREE!
*Contest is only open to funders who have pre-ordered at least one Garibaldi Watch. Rewards are not stackable—only one will apply at a time.





Referring your friends is simple. All you have to do is:
1. Log into your account on Indiegogo and 
2. Click on the sharing buttons near the top of our campaign page, which automatically shares your unique link via email or social media. 
You can also copy your unique link by clicking on the link button and paste that into your social media updates or emails.
When your friends click through your unique link and contribute to our project, their contributions will be registered under your name. 
You can track your referrals by clicking on your user name on the top right of the page, then going to ""My Contributions"" and clicking on the ""Referrals"" tab.
At the end of the campaign, we will tally how many referrals you have and deliver your reward to you!




Our Development Process



We designed every single part of the watch (except the internal movement) ourselves. The attached photos show the different stages of development in the overall process before we were 100% happy with the design.
When conceptualising our product we used our two 3D printers to print the different cases we were considering. 


This is where our 3D printing our prototypes proved invaluable:

We were able to minimise costs by 3D printing all our favourite designs before deciding on the winner.
We did extensive development in the ergonomics of the casing to ensure it would be comfortable for both mens and women's wrist sizes. This meant optimizing the weight distribution and wall thickness.

Our 3D printed strap even shows the denim and stitching detailing.


Our Name

When deciding on a name for our brand, one of
the areas of our research was the history of denim and how it has become to be
a staple of people’s wardrobes. There are various stories as to how and from where
denim originated and subsequently rose to prominence but one such tale caught
our eye. 
We drew inspiration from an Italian general from the 1800s, Giuseppe
Garibaldi. One day Garibaldi faced an uphill battle where the odds were completely stacked against him. Seeing that this could have been his last battle he decided to throw tradition out the window and wear whatever he wanted, which turned out to be a pair of blue pants. 
He won this battle and became a cult hero around the world, and so began the trend of wearing blue pants,
which would later evolve into lighter versions of denim. We believe the name
Garibaldi fits our brand perfectly as it promotes doing your own thing,
starting something new, and fearless approach to life.

We enjoy excellent and longstanding relationships with our suppliers and one of the original founders of Garibaldi Watches will be onsite at the manufacturing centres throughout the campaign and production cycle to ensure the highest quality and standards are met. 
We have everything in place to launch our product line and the means to correct anything that might go wrong . Most important, we will continue to be transparent throughout the campaign, and also into production and beyond if Garibaldi Watches is funded. If you have any specific questions about our campaign, our products, or our brand please ask us directly and we will continue to update the answers to the FAQ. Alternatively, shoot us an email via: info@garibaldiwatches.com

We want to say a BIG THANK YOU for checking out our project, and your help in making it a reality.

We realise that not everyone might be in a position to pledge but you can also help us spread the word by checking out and sharing our campaign on social media. Every little helps!

FAQ
Q: Can I pledge to get more than one watch at a certain level?
A: Of course you can! For each additional watch you want, simply add on another pledge amount to your current pledge. For example, if you're in at the $125 level, add an extra $125 for each additional watch. If you want two watches at that pledge amount, you'd pledge $250.
Q: When can I select my watch of choice?
A: We will be sending out our official survey once our project ends. You will then be able to select your watch and give us your correct shipping instructions.
Q: What type of stainless steel do you use for the watches?
A: Garibaldi Watches use a high quality 316 Low Carbon Grade stainless steel that looks and feels great.
Q: What type of movement is used?
A: Both our 42mm and 38mm watches use Japanese Miyota Precision Quartz movements, which are world renowned for being accurate and reliable. Our 42mm watch includes the date function while our minimalist 38mm watch does not.
Q: Is the watch waterproof?
A: It's water resistant meaning it's fine to wear when in the rain or washing the dishes. On the other hand if you're off scuba diving leave it at home.
Q: What is the warranty on the watch?
A: One Year Manufacturers Guarantee on the movement of our watches. Unfortunately, the warranty does not cover damages that may occur from everyday wear and tear.
Q: When will my card be charged?
A: All cards will be charged after time has ran out on the campaign. You should see a charge on your account 3-5 days after the campaign ends.
Q: When will my watch be shipped?
A: Manufacturing is standing by! If and when we’re successfully funded and our campaign ends we will put the order in. We expect to have all watches shipped out by December 2015 - just in time for Christmas!!

<p> Our passion at Bikini Thief, women. We want to be a positive influence on women, helping to empower anyway we can.

In addition, we do and will continue to partner and support organizations in local and far reaching communities that provide support and give back to girls and women in a variety of ways. </p>
<p> Bikini Thief is also proud to be 100% made in Pasadena, California. The swimwear made in the USA is the best quality possible, and therefore slightly more expensive to make. We want every woman to be able to afford a Bikini Thief swimsuit which is why we keep the cost of our suits as low as possible while delivering made in the USA quality.</p>
<p> We feel that our message and our quality products go hand in hand in how we define ourselves. By expanding our product line BEYOND! swimwear, we can reach more people and help empower more women. </p>

<p> Sampling, fine tune fitting, and marketing. That's the hard part. Once we get things going, economies of scale allow us to negotiate better prices for materials and deliver a high quality product at the best price possible. The more we raise, the more we can develop. We have lofty ambitions that are well rooted in the economics of sound business development.</p>
<p> From our start, Bikini Thief is proud to donate time and products to a variety of charitable causes. Empowering women is our focus but we have and will continue to donate to schools, support groups, and community events. Our success with celebrities wearing Bikini Thief and appearances in high profile media events like Sports Illustrated Swim allows us to leverage brand recognition to help events raise funds and attention to their cause.</p>
<p> As you know, with almost everything today, things change fast. We take a risk when designing new suits and new patterns. What the world loves today, may just be for today.

</div></div>","ILATRO is the realization of a dream: to imagine and create new CARBON FIBER PRODUCTS that improve the lives of all, designed and handmade in ITALY.Do you remember when suitcases were without wheels? Probably not. That was the first great revolution. Ilatro’s carry-on bag is the second.
We
are a team of young Italians who love to travel and explore the World. We are also designers, lawyers and have loads of experience in mechanical engineering.
We
believe that time is precious and that even moments of anticipation, if
well spent, will improve our lives.
So
we wondered: how can we reduce the stress of travel to improve our lives and
those of others? How can we take pleasure during times of waiting?
Ilatro suitcases are the first carry-on bags that allow you to have a seat when no
other seat is available. And, if necessary, they transform into a backpack.WWW.ILATRO.COM
HOW DOES IT WORK


IT'S BASED ON A PATENTED DESIGN
Ilatro carry-on bags are the perfect combination of passion, professionalism and
Italian design.




LEAVE YOUR CARBON FIBER CASE AT THE HOTEL, AND EXPLORE THE WORLD WITH JUST A BACKPACK ON YOUR SHOULDERS!
By means of
simple screw hooks the fabric part can be detached from the carbon fiber to become a backpack.
The backpacks
are interchangeable. You can choose among three different colors.

You can change color as you like and customize your everyday look.





The backpacks
are made of high-strength polyester for a durable, soft shape.

CUSTOMIZATION: YOUR BACKPACK WILL BE FOREVER YOURS.
In addition
to the choice of color we give you the possibility to customize your backpack
and make it uniquely yours: we can embroider your name or email on your backpack!


If it gets lost someone might
find it and take the effort to get it back to you. 

WASHABLE AND WATERPROOF






Sometimes things do not go as planned... Like when a pack breaks: chocolate, cosmetics or simply time can dirty your carry-on luggage.

How did you
solve the problem in the past? Our backpacks you can simple throw into the laundry ... as many times as you want.



A REAL OBJECT OF DESIGN




Traditional suitcases, when they are not used, are hidden in cupboards or closets. 

 
An Ilatro suitcase, on the other hands, is a design object, to expose and use not only during a travel but every day to lend your home a unique style and an elegant decor.
TAKE CARE OF PEOPLE YOU LOVE!




Children, the elderly or adults with mobility impairments
often need to rest: sometimes it is enough a gesture as simple as sitting down
to regain serenity.



TECHNICAL DATA SHEET




AIRLINES RESTRICTIONS: ILATRO SUITCASES MEET THE SIZE REQUIREMENTS OF MOST OF THEM.
Many airlines
have restrictions regarding the size and weight of the luggage: Ilatro suitcases fits
both these requirements.





Leveraging the lightness of carbon fiber we minimizes the weight of the carry-on bag. And that leaves more space available for the things that really matter to you... without paying for extra weight.






WHERE WE ARE
Our company is located in the south of Italy, in Apulia, the ""land of the trulli"", ancient stone houses that have been declared UNESCO world heritage.





 ( ALBEROBELLO -  Itria Valley - Italian region of APULIA)





Here, among a Mediterranean setting, the production of aircraft components began in the 1930s.


ILATRO or Phillyrea latifolia is a species typical of the Mediterranean.The fruits are ripe blacks, similar to olives, but smaller and rounder.

The wood Ilatro is hard and compact, durable as carbon fiber.

The know-how evolved over time in our region now includes the processing of new composite materials, including carbon fiber.HOW WE PRODUCE IT:
An high-tech process for a new generation of materials 


Composite
materials have become a precious resource in the creation of numerous products,
since they combine lightness, mechanical resistance and fine aesthetics.
Carbon fiber is the material with which the airplanes of the future are made.




To make our carbon fiber suitcases we use a production process that involves autoclaves: the very same technology used by the aerospace industry for making satellites, space rockets and airplanes. This approach is more expensive than other manufacturing  processes, but it is the only one that guarantees high performance in terms of mechanical strength,
lightness and flexibility.
POSSIBLE  RISKS & CHALLENGES

One of the biggest risks
when you contribute to a crowd-founding campaign are delays due to production troubles. This happens because few start-up companies run their own production
plants and must thus out-source manufacturing to other companies, often found on the other side of the planet.
WE BUILD OUR OWN PRODUCTS


WE TAKE MANUFACTURING SERIOUSLY: WE HAVE ALREADY SET UP A PRODUCTION PLANT IN ITALY, THE MOLDS ARE DONE- WE HAVE EVEN BUILT OUR OWN AUTOCLAVE MACHINE.
WE DIRECTLY TAKE CARE OF THE REALIZATION OF OUR PRODUCTS.


WE ARE READY TO MAKE BEAUTIFUL PRODUCTS!!!
So what we need now is you!!!


Your contribution is important because it allows us to hire people who

We believe
that scientific research and technological innovation are the heart of any
company, but we know we are still too small to address these challenges alone.
For this
purpose we have formed a strong partnership with CETMA, a research center,
where young and talented researchers, specialized in materials engineering and
industrial design, work with us to find new and more efficient production
models to be used directly in our facilities.

Today’s children do not know what a Rubik’s cube is, but they know very well, where you can buy a powerball. We cannot imagine our morning without a hot cup of instant coffee and hot water. It is difficult to make us get to work without transport, and we will never give up our cell phones. That’s not surprising; we are living in the age of information and technology. Every year the hundreds of new high-tech devices invent all over the world and they simplify our lives. Our company also wants to contribute.</i></p><p style=""margin-left:35.4pt;text-align: center;""><strong>How it began:</strong></p><p style=""margin-left:35.4pt;"">History WockyWolf company began two years ago, when two friends Oleg Andronov and Alexei Burdonov decided to create their own company for the production and release of prams, with the introduction of innovative technologies. The idea came to us, paying attention to walking moms with strollers for newborns, when we realized what is missing in the pram and why modern people feel uncomfortable. After studying the global market of well-known brands of baby carriages and taking polls of more than 1,500 thousands of mothers, we realized what to change.</p><p style=""margin-left:35.4pt;"">And from the moment on, we seriously approached to the decision of tasks aiming to start the pram’s production. We wished to care for parent’s convenience and child’s safety.</p><p style=""margin-left:35.4pt;"">2014 - 2015 years were the most difficult for us. We have worked on ShakeSystem technology for a long time. It easily shakes pram without the mother’s hands while standing on the ground. That is very smooth and soothing movements for the child. Newborns love to wiggle; it reminds them the time when they were in mother’s tummy.</p><p style=""margin-left:35.4pt;"">Another difficulty was in decreasing weight of our pram due to the use of lightweight materials, but without losing sight of safety, reliability, ease and stability. At the junction of these qualities, we have received weight of 17.8 kilograms.</p><p style=""margin-left:35.4pt;"">At the second stage, we developed a special niche extending the housing cradle, and removing all the usual hanging bag is fixed on the handle. Mom can put there all the necessary things for the baby (bottle food, napkins, diapers etc.). We have made two departments in the niche, which can heat the bottle for the baby, and one more important thing in the modern age: USB connector for charging devices. The niche is located under the handle and easily accessible.</p><p style=""margin-left:35.4pt;"">We have implemented a heating regulated handle with many different positions for bad weather conditions. It will be very convenient to everyone who carries pram (mom, dad, grandma or grandpa) can adjust it by height and overhang.</p><p style=""margin-left:35.4pt;"">Since the beginning of March 2015 and by the end of 2015 we were responsible for the development of the display and the power supply of all electrical components.</p><p style=""margin-left:35.4pt;"">We created warning system and to save the baby’s sleep and not wake him up randomly-up appeared warning system and its synchronization with cell phone via Bluetooth. Pram’s handle pleasantly vibrating when you will receive incoming call or SMS and the built-in display shows its details. To ensure the operation of all electrical items of the pram, we have equipped it with a built-in battery self-charged function due to integrated in wheels electric generator. The battery can be also recharged at home via the micro-USB.</p><p style=""margin-left:35.4pt;"">At the beginning of 2016 we paid our attention to the child’s safety, design and materials.</p><p style=""margin-left:35.4pt;"">There is harness in all types of strollers for elder children, but in prams for infants they are not available for some models. While the baby carriage going down the stairs, the child can slither down and stroller roll over, so we have to provide security in advance.</p><p style=""margin-left:35.4pt;"">An important feature of the pram is passabitily. Large rubber wheels provide maximum passability in all conditions. A soft swing-out mechanism gives greater maneuverability of the pram.</p><p style=""margin-left:35.4pt;"">WockyWolf is equipped with a reliable braking system on the two rear wheels.</p><p style=""margin-left:35.4pt;"">Our pram has reflective strips gleaming in the dark. The extra light will draw the driver’s attention that there is someone on the road or near it;</p><p style=""margin-left:35.4pt;"">Unusual design of «Watermelon» style can attract many people. It is perfectly suits to the company name. After all, it's not a secret that the favorite food for the wolf-cubs is a watermelon berry.

Walk will always be comfortable and safe.We spent over two years studying mother’s needs and carefully made our first pram equipping it with revolutionary facilities. Every seam, wire, pockets for folding things and devices have been thoroughly tested. The result is the best thing for modern mums.The whole our team shares our happiness and believe that the walk with our pram will be joyful and comfortable for each parent around the world. Our pram’s patented heated handle will protect your skin from the effects of adverse weather conditions.Your baby’s sleep will no longer be disturbed by sudden incoming phone calls, because we have equipped our pram with an alerting system synchronized to your cell phone via Bluetooth.When you have an incoming call or text message the handle will vibrate gently to let you know, and the display will show the details.Go about your day or talk with friends while your baby is lulled gently to sleep, hands-free!You can also recharge the battery at home.When walking your baby after dark, these decorative features will also draw the attention of drivers and pedestrians and help prevent collisions.Under the pram’s handle there is a special recess with two easy-to-reach compartments to keep your baby’s drink warm.Here we’ve also installed two handy USB slots. This small recess can hold anything you might need: nappies, towels, toys and so on.  XXI century is called the century of the modern IT-industry. Today’s children do not know what a Rubik’s cube is, but they know very well, where you can buy a powerball. We cannot imagine our morning without a hot cup of instant coffee and hot water. It is difficult to make us get to work without transport, and we will never give up our cell phones. That’s not surprising; we are living in the age of information and technology. Every year the hundreds of new high-tech devices invent all over the world and they simplify our lives. Our company also wants to contribute.How it began:History WockyWolf company began two years ago, when two friends Oleg Andronov and Alexei Burdonov decided to create their own company for the production and release of prams, with the introduction of innovative technologies. The idea came to us, paying attention to walking moms with strollers for newborns, when we realized what is missing in the pram and why modern people feel uncomfortable. After studying the global market of well-known brands of baby carriages and taking polls of more than 1,500 thousands of mothers, we realized what to change.And from the moment on, we seriously approached to the decision of tasks aiming to start the pram’s production. We wished to care for parent’s convenience and child’s safety.2014 - 2015 years were the most difficult for us. We have worked on ShakeSystem technology for a long time. It easily shakes pram without the mother’s hands while standing on the ground. That is very smooth and soothing movements for the child. Newborns love to wiggle; it reminds them the time when they were in mother’s tummy.Another difficulty was in decreasing weight of our pram due to the use of lightweight materials, but without losing sight of safety, reliability, ease and stability. At the junction of these qualities, we have received weight of 17.8 kilograms.At the second stage, we developed a special niche extending the housing cradle, and removing all the usual hanging bag is fixed on the handle. Mom can put there all the necessary things for the baby (bottle food, napkins, diapers etc.). We have made two departments in the niche, which can heat the bottle for the baby, and one more important thing in the modern age: USB connector for charging devices. The niche is located under the handle and easily accessible.We have implemented a heating regulated handle with many different positions for bad weather conditions. It will be very convenient to everyone who carries pram (mom, dad, grandma or grandpa) can adjust it by height and overhang.Since the beginning of March 2015 and by the end of 2015 we were responsible for the development of the display and the power supply of all electrical components.We created warning system and to save the baby’s sleep and not wake him up randomly-up appeared warning system and its synchronization with cell phone via Bluetooth. Pram’s handle pleasantly vibrating when you will receive incoming call or SMS and the built-in display shows its details. To ensure the operation of all electrical items of the pram, we have equipped it with a built-in battery self-charged function due to integrated in wheels electric generator. The battery can be also recharged at home via the micro-USB.At the beginning of 2016 we paid our attention to the child’s safety, design and materials.There is harness in all types of strollers for elder children, but in prams for infants they are not available for some models. While the baby carriage going down the stairs, the child can slither down and stroller roll over, so we have to provide security in advance.An important feature of the pram is passabitily. Large rubber wheels provide maximum passability in all conditions. A soft swing-out mechanism gives greater maneuverability of the pram.WockyWolf is equipped with a reliable braking system on the two rear wheels.Our pram has reflective strips gleaming in the dark. The extra light will draw the driver’s attention that there is someone on the road or near it;Unusual design of «Watermelon» style can attract many people. It is perfectly suits to the company name. After all, it's not a secret that the favorite food for the wolf-cubs is a watermelon berry. We are also working on other designs, and we would not stay put with earlier attainments.Let's approach the material:In WockyWolf were used only natural materials to the child could easily breathe and not to create the greenhouse effect. On the surface of the cradle trimmed with windproof and waterproof firm fabric. The bottom of the pram trimmed with natural leather, inside our product was used thermo fabric that may be unfasten for washing.We have ideas for the prams of the second generation, and believe me, we will not stop there and every year we will surprise and make you happy...Oleg Andronov about our pram WockyWolfEvgenii Fedorov about our pram WockyWolfValeriy Korenev about our pram WockyWolf1. Where will you have headquarters?Nevada, USA.2. Are you shipping worldwide?Yes.3. What are shipping costs?Transportation costs vary depending on the selected pram and your location.

Anti-Dripping – There will be no water dripping after use in the rain. This is because we use a highly water resistant canopy and therefore water won’t stick to the surface. Fast Drying – Dries 3 times faster than regular umbrella due to the special characteristic of the surface.UV Protection – the umbrella comes with industry highest standard UPF≥50+ UV Protection.Light Weight – Our foldable umbrella is only half the weight of regular umbrella.

With our superhydrophobic treatment, the surface chemistry of the canopy won't allow rain (which contain bacterias)  stick to the canopy . Therefore, without harmful bacterias growing on the canopy or surroundings like inside the vehicle or carpet, there won't be any awful odors.

Extra fine silk like fabric weave together with multi-layers of protection for rain and sun ray.

Ever seen someone brought in a soaking wet umbrella? With our Drip stop technology, nothing will ever drip after a good shake.


With the typical umbrella, water drips everywhere and it makes a mess! With our Shakeshake umbrella, there won’t be water dripping.

 

With to our special formulate treatment, the superhydrophobic effect can last up to 30mins without any wetting. 
 

Superhydrophobic testing for wettability

 


Even when the weather is really bad or you were outdoor for an extensive period of time and you notice a little wetting on your Shakeshake umbrella, with our weaving pattern, it will dry in no time! Here,  a 20 minutes drying test to show how effective Shakeshake Umbrella dries compare to other umbrellas that claim to have fast drying.

Dry 3 times faster than regular umbrella


Drying Shakeshake umbrella in closed position makes easy anywhere 

 

Many of you would know that people who get great amount of exposure to ultraviolet ray（mainly UVA & UVB）are at greater risk for skin cancer. And most people think about sun protection only when they spend a day doing outdoor activities. But something many would not notice is that sun exposure adds up day by day, and it happens every time you are exposed to the sun. With our ShakeShake Umbrella, it offers UPF 50+ protection. There is no need to spend time and put on sunscreen when you are just walking from your office to lunch or just need to be outside for a short walk, just simply pop open  and it is ready to go. It is time to take care of our skin.
 

With ShakeShake Umbrella offers UPF 50+ protection which is the highest industry standard.There is no need to spend time and put on sunscreen and reapply after a few hours, just simply pop it open and it is ready to go. 



Frame is made from aluminum and reinforced fiberglass.

Groceries bags are often used to carry wet umbrellas. In some countries, shopping centres, restaurants and hotels even offer their customers a special made plastic bags for umbrellas to ensure it won’t drip. As most of you would know, plastic bags are made of non-renewable resource and they destroy the environment. You can use now save the environment by usingShakeshake Umbrella, an umbrella that doesn’t drip.   Steel Grey & Deep Cobalt Long Version Umbrella Foldable Version Umbrella 


Sheer Tech was founded by Anxon, Kyle, and Tiffany, it began with a simple idea. We got tired of wet umbrella dripping and always making everything around us soaking wet. We wanted something much more versatile, convenient, and environment-friendly, so we develop an umbrella that can solve all that!
 
 Updates:Foldable Ver Umbrella Cover  
Our team worked very hard to bring Shakeshake Umbrella to a point where they are ready to be mass produced.  We are finish with prototyping and have finalized on the working models.  We have sourced all of our components, finalized our designs and gone through 13 different iterations of the umbrellas to get to where we are right now. All that remains is to place a production order based on  you guys and our distributor needs. The fabrication and framework are underway and we have a reliable manufacturer source that can produce quality products at a large scale.

</div></div>","Why is the bag you set off with never big enough for what the day throws at you? Why are you left fumbling for keys, muddling your laptop with your gym kit, then having to buy shopping bags?
Ohyo has teamed up with London designer Felix Conran to produce one multi-purpose bag that grows with your day, sorts out your stuff and reduces use of plastic bags. Now wouldn't that feel better?
Ohyo Bag Mark 1 was successfully funded on Kickstarter in 4 days, we need your orders to up-scale production and develop Mark 2.



The Ohyo bag is:
• a tablet bag that increases in size to hold your gym kit.
•	a workbag that expands to hold your groceries.
• a backpack that unfolds for a weekend away.
•	a travel bag that gets bigger to accommodate those last minute purchases.
It truly is a case (or bag) of one size fits all.


The first 500 Ohyo Bags are being made in London now. With your input we're tweaking the design and colours and preparing to upscale production.

 About Ohyo
Ohyo was set up to produce products that make life a little more convenient. Our collapsible Ohyo water bottle extends to hold 500ml or 1000ml. And when empty it will squish down to fit in a pocket or bag. Using (and re-using) an Ohyo avoids the need to buy environmentally damaging bottled water. 


The Ohyo bag, like the bottle, is designed to make everyday life that bit easier. And if it means fewer plastic bags get used, that’s an added bonus.
With your support, The Ohyo Bag will be the first of many adaptable products by Felix Conran (Grandson of Sir Terence Conran) and Guy Jeremiah. You can watch Guy pitch the Ohyo Bag to investors and Jason Manford on Dave TV's Money Pit at 7:30pm on Thursday 12th November!

</div></div>","Our MissionDrift Light is built on the belief that doing business and doing good are not mutually exclusive. We’ve found that we can solve complex problems by breaking them down. The issue that we’ve dedicated ourselves to is improving the lives of the nearly 600,000 men, women, and children currently homeless in the US (Source: 2015 Congressional Report on Homelessness). This number is staggering, and the problem is extraordinarily complex. So let’s start small.We were surprised to find that socks and underwear are the most needed, yet least donated items at shelters across the US. It’s amazing that something as small as a fresh pair of underwear can have a large impact. So we set out to come up with a sustainable, scalable way to provide basic necessities to homeless shelters, and in the long-term, provide jobs to those transitioning out of homelessness. Enter Drift Light.While in her last semester at Duke, our founder combined her experience in fashion and volunteering at homeless shelters to create a beautiful line of underwear that donates basic socks and underwear for every purchase made. In an effort to make this idea a reality, Willa entered the Duke Changeworks Startup Competition and ended up winning. The judges were excited about the concept and believed she could quickly take the concept from an idea to a reality. One year later, we’re ready to officially launch the company.Our Game PlanAll contributions go toward two main things: fulfilling product orders and donations to shelters across the US. Our first donation events will be in Raleigh-Durham, NC, Minneapolis-St. Paul, MN, and Los Angeles, CA. We call our donation model One for Many, because we’re able to donate up to a week’s worth of basic socks and underwear for every purchase made. So when you buy one, you give many.                      The rest of the funds will go toward our first Drift Light purchase order. We have manufacturing lined up and are ready to start production so you can get your new favorite undies. All of our pieces are handmade in Los Angeles by family-owned shops. We are proud to use high-quality, eco-friendly materials. By using bamboo cotton, we’re able to create incredibly soft underwear from a renewable resource. Additionally, our shipping materials are selected by our Sustainability Consultant, Serena, to be both cost-effective and eco-friendly. We are committed to doing the most good.How You Can HelpIf you're ready to join us on this journey, there are many ways you can help!

<h3><strong>The designer: Diana Vassileva</strong></h3>
<p>After completing my studies at the European Institute of Design in Milan, I started working in the style office of a Bergamo manufacturer, where I had the opportunity to collaborate with several important brands, and I participated in the creation and affirmation of the corporate brand. <br/>As I was raising my technical and creative skills, I found out my growing need to experiment and to adapt the same garment to the many daily needs. I started building the whole idea, sketch by sketch. After making a few prototypes, I was surprised of how functional were they and how comfort and creativity were placed in the same piece of garment! Then I've patented this project and the journey began!</p>
<p>And here I am! This is one of my transformable styles, and it belongs to the latest Spring- Summer collection: it's a simple dress that you could wear in 4 different ways by adding and changing its fronts. You save time, space and money, having four different looks, and you could change them everywhere you want to. </p>
<p>The dress has two hidden zips and a couple of press buttons, so you can choose your favorite front, attach it on your dress in a few minutes and go! The dress and the fronts are made of high quality, non-folding materials, produced in Europe, with a great attention for the detail. </p>
<p>For us 'transformation' is freedom: being everywhere as you want, following your own comfort without sacrificing style: infact we have already developed the next spring/summer and fall/winter transformable collections, and they are just waiting to be produced and marketed... and that is where you can help. </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The Multi Face Dress is a part of the second spring/summer collection and for the first time we present this idea of transformable garments out of Italy. <br/>We've already tested the techniques, the fabrics and the comfort of this product and we work with a very professional team of seamstresses and pattern constructors, with our partners in the European Union, that has been operating for long years in the international market. </p>
<p>Our challenge is to affirm the idea that every woman is special and free to choose and change. Bringing to life the entire transformable collection with different styles and accessories, we'll give our customers the 'instruments' to create their own look. </p>
<p>Alter the Indiegogo's sales campaign, as every production, we'll order immediately the materials we need to produce the dresses. We will keep you informed about every step of the production: fabric arrivals, zips and buttons, cut and seam. You'll be able to see our work in progress by life photo and short videos, here on Indiegogo. In this way you'll be informed for any modifications regarding the product and the estimated delivery date. <br/><strong>ORDERS:</strong> To do the order of the Multi Face Dress, you should choose the color of the basic dress, and the kind of front you most like. To do this, just check up our sizing chart and our color/front proposal above. After the campaign we'll contact you to establish the missing information regarding the front you've chosen. We'll send you by e-mail a summary sketch of the combination you've ordered. <br/><strong>COLORS:</strong> As the project is in a digital support, there could be differences between the color in the photo and the real one. <br/><strong>MATERIALS: </strong>the materials we use are very suitable for summer as do not sweat, they are high-quality, made of viscoses, mixed with silk and polyester. This mixture guarantees that the dress and the fronts will not be creased while worn or during the transportation. <br/><strong>RETURNS:</strong> we will not be able to do returns, as most Indiegogo campaigns.</p>

<p>I've been accepted onto an MA program in Fashion Entrepreneurship and Innovation. My mission at LCF would be to figure out a way to challenge these issues through one of the only ways we lift our heads to pay attention - fashion.</p>

<p>Knitwear being the most sustainable form of fashion, People! would be the 'nudging knitwear brand' that inspires people to bring their own carrier bags to shops, helps someone in distress step back and take a minute to breathe, or perhaps provokes a busy parent to occupy their child with a wearable object that benefits their motor skills instead of handing them a magic screen. </p>
<p>As you will be funding an idea, not just a postgraduate course, I'm offering never-before-seen garments and accessories to my backers. Many of them are displayed in digital form because I simply do not have time to wait for samples to arrive. I've represented them as realistically as possible, so don't worry about receiving an olive sweatshirt with a cucumber on it.</p>

</div></div>","I'm Allison Aniskina. I'm a 26 year old knitwear designer from New York, temporarily residing in Moscow. I am a creative by nature, and making a positive impact on the world is what drives me the most. Today, it’s up to creatives to think of ingenious ways to make the planet a better place.
Global fashion is in need of reform more than ever, for though it has a crippling impact on the environment, consumers - by default or circumstance - follow the pattern of buying endlessly. Our pace of life is getting faster. We are on call 24 hours a day, and as a result, some of us forget to focus on our mental health. The digital age is costing children important life skills. A big chunk of the first generation growing up in an “always on” world is suffering unforeseen consequences.

<p>Every design you’ll see us put out is drawn and designed by Alegra (she’s a really incredible artist isn’t she?) Alegra has been vegan for about two years now and has participated in a number of rallies, conventions, and even created her own documentary called ""Animal Harm"" that exposes the horrors of the animal industry.</p>

Every design is printed on 100% pre-shrunken hard cotton T-shirts from Panther Printing in Patterson, NJ. We have shirt sizes ranging from unisex XS to XL and each tee has a pocket with the Cadaver Dog logo embroidered on the front.

5% of each sale WILL be donated to our favorite organization, Skylands Animal Sanctuary And Rescue. They do incredible work rescuing and caring for a variety of animals and allowing them to live their best, FULL lives on acres of beautiful farmland.

 
If you haven't stopped reading yet, THANK YOU for your time! Any support aside from our mothers will mean a heck of a lot.
And if you like what you see, don’t forget to visit our website, follow us on Instagram, Twitter, and like us on Facebook! 

The Impact
Alegra here! Starting a clothing line supporting an animal-welfare cause has been a dream of mine for years. I'm a proud vegan who believes one person can make a difference. With your help, you're making a difference in not only our lives, but in the lives of hundreds of animals. When you buy one of our shirts, you're sending the message that compassion and kindness matters.
5% of each sale will be donated to Skylands Animal Sanctuary & Rescue. They are a wonderful sanctuary run by Mike Stura in Wantage, NJ. They often hold tours where you can visit the pigs, cows, chickens, turkeys, and goats that were rescued from slaughterhouses, religious ceremonies, live markets, abandonment, farms, neglect, and abuse.
Learn more by visiting their website: https://skylandssanctuary.org/

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi! I'm Carly Becker. I'm a full-time consultant by day, and a makeup enthusiast and entrepreneur by night. I'm absolutely obsessed with makeup. I have more palettes than pairs of shoes! </p>
<p>I'm starting this campaign because I have a vision. I want to allow the makeup obsessed to express who they are — or who they want to be — with makeup, even if only for a day. I have developed a cosmetics line that allows just that, matching personality traits with curated palettes and lipstick collections. </p>
<p>But I can't do this alone. I need your help and support to reach my goal of starting this amazing company. With these contributions, I can fully launch the business in December 2017 with three flagship palettes and three lipstick collections in three different lipstick formulas. Once I'm funded, I can branch out and offer other makeup products, such as foundation, powders, and makeup brushes. I envision Blend It Like Becker offering a full line of personality-driven cosmetics. Will you be able to find your personality in the collection? </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>

</ul>
</li>
<li>There are a variety of perks you can get by contributing to the campaign.<ul><li>Most importantly, the first two flagship palette, Attention to Detail, and Life of the Party.

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>Blend It Like Becker is an innovative company in the cosmetics industry for one main reason: personality. We all want to express ourselves through our makeup. Now you can find palettes and lipstick collections designed specifically with your personality traits in mind, be it personality traits you love about yourself, admire in others, or aspire to have. Even if you don't care about the personality, you'll love the beautiful, versatile, wearable color stories told through each palette, and the buttery soft, richly pigmented high-quality shadows and blushes. Not to mention the three unique lipstick formulas that are all amazing in their own ways. </li>
<li>The announcement of the Blend It Like Becker cosmetics line garnered over 1,100 likes on Instagram! When Attention to Detail was announced, 40 people immediately signed up for the wait list. It's obvious that people want what Blend It Like Becker has, and now it's your opportunity to make this company a reality.</li>
<li>This company is my dream, my obsession, my life. I will do everything in my power to make sure it is a success.

</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<ul>
<li>One of the biggest risks I face is not meeting my goal. If this happens, I will still be able to fulfill perks, and depending on how much is raised, I might still be able to launch in December, but it will be on a much smaller scale. </li>
<li>Another risk, on the opposite end of the spectrum, is that I raise more than what I need. This would be amazing, but it would also cause a lot more work on me to fulfill perks. I am prepared to bring in a team if I'm overwhelmed by orders, so you can rest assured that you will receive your perks in a timely manner. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I get it if you aren't able to contribute. That's ok, but that doesn't mean you can't help! Share this Indiegogo campaign on all of your social networks, tagging @blenditlikebecker on IG or CarlyBecker710 on Twitter, and using the hashtag #madeupwithpersonality. Use the Indiegogo sharing tools provided on the website. You could even put a note about my Indiegogo in your email signature! Spreading the word helps me just as much as contributing does! </p>

<p>We have been working on this project for a year, with art selection and sample production and market testing.  We are ready to express ourselves and launch!</p>
<p>To start, we want to offer Vallaeia’s art in the form of pareos, a unique, versatile wearable art piece that can be expressed in whatever style you want to wear.  No limits.  We will show you at least 20 ways.  We named this expression,<strong><i> Pono Pareos</i></strong>.  Pono in Hawaiian has a variety of subtle meanings and we use Pono as the way of perfection no matter how it shows up. Our Pono Pareos will show up in many ways for you, however you choose, and it will always be perfect.</p>

<p>We have contracted with an agent in Bali who evaluated and secured our production company for the sample production run.  Since the samples have been run, we are making some minor adjustments in the color tones and in the manufacturing quality of the pareo.  The funding goal, $8,000 will be completely invested in production and shipping to our Hawaii location.  Since these pareos are part of the perks, some of the funding will be used to ship the perks to you.

Our Pono Pareos will show up in many ways for you, however you choose, and it will always be perfect.
Kumu Ehulani's Pono hula, just for you.

<h3>WHO WE ARE</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>DODÖ was founded by the designer Dominique Millan, a passionate illustrator and textile designer. DODÖ is an accessories design brand which proposed, design, variety and colour. In our experience, day by day, we always found the same characteristics in accessories, the same kind of colours or pattern, and no matter how much we inquired everything was the same.</p>
<p>So tired of this of this monotony, we decided to propose a new line based on the chromatic variety.</p>
<p>Our accessories are hand-painted on a canvas, once they are ready, then they are protected with PVC cover. We use the best AVIOS in the market, so we can made a quality product. In our day to day, we look new forms and themes, from which we are inspired and managed to abstract them and transform them into new pieces of design.</p>
<p>Created and inspired for you, DODÖ.</p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">FEELING</h2>
<p>Each purse is a piece of art, so you can forget about the regular colours or find someone with a similar purse, that will not happen again with our purses, each of them is one of a kind, because they are hand painted so is going to be impossible to find two equals.</p>

<p align=""center"">We defined our primary materials after extensive testing and prototyping, choosing high quality over quantity. It took us over seven months of experimentation to decide what to use. We care about every detail in each product.</p>
<p align=""center"">Our accessories are hand-painted on a canvas.  Once they are ready, they are then protected with PVC cover. We attach our logo on a piece of crystal clear acrylic, cut by laser, and we add gold colored metal accents.</p>
<p align=""center"">Our scarfs are printed on gauze and hand-sewn. Each design is a hand drawing, created by the designers of DODÖ.</p>

<h2>FAQS</h2>
<ul><li><strong>How did you get this idea?</strong></li></ul>
<p>We were looking a different approach for an accessories brand. We wanted something new, something different that moves away from monotony, also something hand made, because a in world like today that a lot of things are made in factories, we want something made by humans, an object that has history, that is done with love. We want to create something unique, colorful, amusing, each one different. So, after experimenting with materials and ideas, we came to the final product.</p>
<ul><li><strong>What does DODÖ mean?</strong></li></ul>
<p>DODÖ is how Dominique’s mother calls her. Her mother is one of the most important persons in her life, so she selected that nickname to head this accessories line in her mother’s honor, as a way to give her tribute for everything that she has made for Dominique and her sister.</p>

Our accessories are hand-painted on a canvas, once they are ready, then they are protected with PVC cover. We use the best AVIOS in the market, so we can made a quality product. In our day to day, we look new forms and themes, from which we are inspired and managed to abstract them and transform them into new pieces of design.
Created and inspired for you, DODÖ.
FEELING
Each purse is a piece of art, so you can forget about the regular colours or find someone with a similar purse, that will not happen again with our purses, each of them is one of a kind, because they are hand painted so is going to be impossible to find two equals.

FEATURES

 





 





 
- WRISTBAND -
To take into account:You can carry the clutch or use the wristband and carry it in your wrist.


In the process, we have incorporated a new detail in the wristband.

- A NEW PULLER -
We made a new change in the puller for the zipper in the clutch. The classic puller has been changed to a tassel puller.

 
ONE OF A KIND
Every one of our bags is a unique piece of art.
Each one is hand-painted and hand-made.HAND-PAINTED: the handbags start as a painting on canvas, like a piece of art.HAND-MADE: We work with Peruvian artisans to achieve a unique and quality product. 
We use each unique design in various combinations and shapes, show-casing the originality of the work of art.
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
DESIGN, DETAILS AND QUALITY
We defined our primary materials after extensive testing and prototyping, choosing high quality over quantity. It took us over seven months of experimentation to decide what to use. We care about every detail in each product.
Our accessories are hand-painted on a canvas.  Once they are ready, they are then protected with PVC cover. We attach our logo on a piece of crystal clear acrylic, cut by laser, and we add gold colored metal accents.
Our scarfs are printed on gauze and hand-sewn. Each design is a hand drawing, created by the designers of DODÖ.



 
SAMPLES

 
ART AND CONCEPT, IN BAGS AND SCARVES
We based our designs initially in figure drawings, which are reflected in the scarves. We take the color scheme and abstract the figure drawings into a final design for the handbags.
WE ARE CURRENTLY WORKING ON THESE:

FAQS
How did you get this idea?
We were looking a different approach for an accessories brand. We wanted something new, something different that moves away from monotony, also something hand made, because a in world like today that a lot of things are made in factories, we want something made by humans, an object that has history, that is done with love. We want to create something unique, colorful, amusing, each one different. So, after experimenting with materials and ideas, we came to the final product.
What does DODÖ mean?

These come from unsold inventory or recycling industry.  Our leather is tanned without chromium. This chemical element is toxic for humans and the environment. So we use alternative tanning technologies which are non-toxic for workers and eco-friendly.  Our collections are directly inspired by the jeans. Tommy, the founder and designer, found a year ago an old used denim of a famous brand in the back of his wardrobe and had the inspiration to make a shoe with some parts of it. After several tests with the manufacturer we've made a very cool prototype with the entire jean. The Eco-friendly project was born !So we reproduced the 5th pocket of a pair of jeans to our shoes which makes the collection feel just as cool : are you wearing a pair of jeans or a pair of shoes on your feet? In those, there can be a slight difference of shade between the same 2 models which makes each pair unique and irreplaceable.We launched 2 models: The espadrilles, Jeanne, are declined in two colors. Marius the sneakers, declined in 10 colors.          THE STRING wants to involve people and make them aware of the consequences of deforestation and palm oil production for the Orangutan Habitat.So for each pair of shoes pre-ordered, we make backers plant 10 trees* to reforest Orangutan habitat in Indonesia. We do it in partnership with BOS Foundation* (http://orangutan.or.id/) which rescues, rehabilitates and reintroduces orangutans *Each backer will receive a certificate from Borneo Orangutan Survival. Palm oil production is directly responsible for Orangutan extinction that’s why we want to involve people and make them aware of the consequences of deforestation.WE WANT TO CONTRIBUTE TO THINGS CHANGE ! Materials that we use are recycled, sustainable, and responsibleFor the denim collections we use authentic American pairs of jeans. Those come from unsold inventories or the recycling industry.  Most leather in the fashion and shoe industries is tanned using chromium (from 80 to 95% of all leather produced worldwide).  Chromium is a chemical element which is toxic for humans and the environment.So our leather is tanned without chromium. We use alternative tanning technologies which are non-toxic for workers and eco-friendly. * * That includes the use of oxazolidine in combination with other re-tanning agents of synthetic and vegetal origins For the lining inside of the shoes, we use an antiperspirant and antibacterial “veggie” material in synthetic leather, 100% organic.  The sole that we use for the sneakers is made with rubber which is 35 to 50% recycled. The espadrille sole is made with jute rope that is 100% natural. To ensure quality products and workers’ conditions, we chose to make our shoes in Spain and Portugal. Portugal is today one of the best shoe producer in the world and the Basque Country in Spain is the best producer of espadrilles. This choice allows us to visit our manufactories and checking at any time in few hours of driving. Why The String ?THE STRING is the link between people and environment. In our mind, it allows to keep connected  animals, nature, and people to each other.It's also the strings of Guitar, Violin and Piano which inspire us in all the collections we design and the projects we launch.   Why making an eco-friendly shoe brand?We’ve been working in the shoe industry for more than 6 years but even if we’ve taken care about social responsibility and the environment, we haven’t been able to control all the steps of the production and check if the products were sustainable and responsible.We noticed that a few shoe brands exist which care about the environment, but not enough to be concerned about the quality and design as well.So we decided to create a brand new shoe, eco-friendly and sustainable to offer the coolest sustainable shoes ever!  Why Orangutans ?  It’s a topic that has been bothering us for several years. Palm oil production is directly responsible for Orangutan extinction.  That’s why we want to involve people and make them aware of the consequences of deforestation on the Orangutan Habitat.One of the triggers for our action is a video which appeared on YouTube a few months ago and shows an Orangutan trying all by himself to stop a bulldozer which was destroying his home. video here : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4zzbwM07bwWe were really shocked by that and decided not to be spectators any longer, but to be players and contribute to things changing! Established in 1991, the Borneo Orangutan Survival (BOS) Foundation is an Indonesian non-profit organization dedicated to the conservation of the Bornean Orangutan and its habitat, in co-operation with local communities, the Indonesian Ministry of Forestry and international partner organizations. BOS MISSIONSReintroducing :   Accelerating the release of Bornean orangutans from ex-situ to in-situ locationsProtecting :   Encouraging the protection of Bornean orangutans and their habitat.  Increasing the empowerment of communities surrounding orangutan habitatsCapacity Building :   Strengthening institutional capacityResearching :  Supporting research and education activities for the conservation of Bornean orangutans and their habitatPartnerships : Promoting the participation of and partnership with all stakeholdersTHANK YOU !!!A huge thank to all the backers who support us with this project.

Our mission is to provide an easy and comprehensive way for that to happen. That's why we developed WRIXO, a wearable device that provides crucial medical information during a medical emergency. It is ideal for elderly friends and family members or for a child with a medical condition. It can also be used as a medical ID. Embedded in WRIXO is an Near Field Communication (NFC) wireless chip that contains a unique patient ID. Emergency responders can tap into WRIXO by using an NFC-enabled mobile device or by scanning WRIXO’s QR matrix barcode (for non-NFC-enabled phones) and receive the latest medical information on the patient they are treating._________________________________ FEATURES_________________________________ SHARE EMERGENCY MEDICAL INFO WITH JUST ONE TAP____________________________________ NO APP REQUIREDWhen every second counts, instant access to health information is crucial. WRIXO not only delivers secure access to vital health information, it also complies with HIPAA regulations. It's easy to use. EMTs or emergency medical personnel simply scan, enter their phone number to verify access, then view their patient's medical information.__________________________________ WRIXO IS FOR ANYONE WHO HAD A MEDICAL CONDITION OR WANTS AN ID WRISTBAND ___________________________________ PROVIDE MEDICAL INFORMATION INSTANTLYWith one tap on a smartphone or tablet, first responders can receive medical documents, diagnoses, prescribed medications, and other patient-approved health information on the spot.

<h3>About De Vos by Amber De Vos</h3>
<p>I am Amber De Vos and I am a celebrity and art photographer turned fashion designer.</p>
<p>The story goes that about a little over year ago, I realized how much I loved wearing leggings but that everything I shopped for was either really only suitable to wear to the gym or out clubbing. Neither style was versatile enough to wear all day or really went with anything in my closet.</p>
<p>I couldn't help but wonder why the only options available were either ""too fitness"" looking, or if they were ""fashionable"" the patterns were too loud and didn't go with anything I owned?!</p>
<p>Why, when I did find something truly fashionable, would it cost an arm and a leg and thus I'd never dare sweat in it?!</p>
<p>Why couldn't I have leggings that were comfortable AND stylish? Wearable in the gym AND on the street?</p>
<p>Why couldn't I combine my talents as a photographer and artist to create a whole new line of clothing that anyone could wear all day, in many different situations and that would make them feel exciting and appealing, instead of just fit?</p>
<p>To answer all these questions, I spent a year developing prototypes and learning about creating a new clothing line, harnessing my innate passion for fashion and making people feel foxy (at first in front of my camera, and now in my designs).</p>
<p>My first prototypes turned so many heads and I got so many compliments, I knew I had a product that people would really love.</p>
<p>So, today, I am very proud to bring you this innovative brand, saving you too from the monotony of all the boring products currently on the market,</p>
<p>What ultimately makes this brand different than all other ""athleisure"" options out there? Besides the versatility factor, what's truly special about De Vos are the original sublimated designs featured on the crop tops and leggings. Sublimation is the process of printing art or photographs directly on to fabric. So, you're literally wearing Art.</p>
<p>Now, I get to wear leggings everywhere and with everything, personally I like to pair my De Vos with sweaters, blazers, sheer tops, sneakers and high heels.</p>
<p>You can't get away with that wearing typical workout clothes!</p>
<h3>About This Campaign</h3>
<p>Already have buyers lined up and venues ready to host trunk shows with me!</p>
<p>But I wanted to give the general public an opportunity to be early adopters and get their hands on De Vos before everyone else does. They're available in limited quantities and for a limited time only.</p>
<p>I am pre-selling pieces and raising some capital to help grow my business!</p>

</div></div>","About De Vos by Amber De Vos
I am Amber De Vos and I am a celebrity and art photographer turned fashion designer.
The story goes that about a little over year ago, I realized how much I loved wearing leggings but that everything I shopped for was either really only suitable to wear to the gym or out clubbing. Neither style was versatile enough to wear all day or really went with anything in my closet.
I couldn't help but wonder why the only options available were either ""too fitness"" looking, or if they were ""fashionable"" the patterns were too loud and didn't go with anything I owned?!
Why, when I did find something truly fashionable, would it cost an arm and a leg and thus I'd never dare sweat in it?!
Why couldn't I have leggings that were comfortable AND stylish? Wearable in the gym AND on the street?
Why couldn't I combine my talents as a photographer and artist to create a whole new line of clothing that anyone could wear all day, in many different situations and that would make them feel exciting and appealing, instead of just fit?
To answer all these questions, I spent a year developing prototypes and learning about creating a new clothing line, harnessing my innate passion for fashion and making people feel foxy (at first in front of my camera, and now in my designs).
My first prototypes turned so many heads and I got so many compliments, I knew I had a product that people would really love.
So, today, I am very proud to bring you this innovative brand, saving you too from the monotony of all the boring products currently on the market,
What ultimately makes this brand different than all other ""athleisure"" options out there? Besides the versatility factor, what's truly special about De Vos are the original sublimated designs featured on the crop tops and leggings. Sublimation is the process of printing art or photographs directly on to fabric. So, you're literally wearing Art.
Now, I get to wear leggings everywhere and with everything, personally I like to pair my De Vos with sweaters, blazers, sheer tops, sneakers and high heels.
You can't get away with that wearing typical workout clothes!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. ""Behind the Scenes"" This image is from backstage before a Prada fashion show while Amber was on a freelance assignment. The lighting and set guys standing on bleachers make the mysterious silhouettes on these pieces. 
The tank top features the word ""Invincible"" - encouraging you that no matter what life may throw at you, you are resilient and will come out even stronger on the other side.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
2. ""Chic Stripes"" Amber is a huge New York Rangers hockey fan - this is a shot of the ceiling of the world famous Madison Square Garden during one of their Playoff games
The tank top features the word ""Radiant""  - inspiring you to always shine bright.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. ""Neon Stripes"" This image is inspired by a very unique lighting installation in a New York City restaurant atop the Museum of Art and Design. If you look closer at the red dots on the front, you'll see that they are Exit signs. 
The tank top features the word ""Visionary"" - motivating you to always think big and bold.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. ""Pretty Kitty"" This pair is especially dear to Amber, as this is a portrait of her beloved Balinese cat, ""Olive."" Olive has Siamese features, but with long hair. Her seductive eyes and sweet face make her the perfect model for this daring look.
The tank top features the word ""Worthy"" - reminding you to never doubt that you deserve all the good things that life brings to you.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. ""Peek a Boo"" is an image of a lingerie model wearing incredibly sexy, thigh-high, cut-out boots, which is why it looks like you can see skin peeking through these leggings even though you actually can't.

<p>After realizing the great social impact we could have, we started recycling cotton: manufacturing towels, blankets, bathrobes, and ponchos.

<p>After researching the vast array of plastics that contaminate our oceans and environment, such as fishing nets and single-use plastics, we established which waste could be reduced and recycled into new products.

<p>I am Kate Broadrick, Designer of K8 Swimwear. Creativity has been my main outlet since I can remember- creating garments began with safety pinning seams together, to where I am today, handcrafting swimsuits. My love for design dialed in on swimwear when I moved to Miami for school at 19 years old. Insecurities led me to only step foot on the beach if I could wear my push up bra. I began draping the bra in fabric and creating matching bottoms. With the help of Instagram, I began posting and before I knew it I was taking orders. Bless those of you who purchased the original K8 ""flow top""- The construction was less than ideal. It wasn't until I was asked to create a full line for a fashion show that I really felt the fruits of my labor. I decided to let go of the push up bra and design off of the natural silloutte. When I saw these women lined up, all different body shapes, huge smiles, feeling incredibly sexy, I knew this was it. I wanted every woman to feel this, to feel honored, and celebrated in their skin. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1525729342/rtfwwb9bgzvmfcdz0jo6.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>K8 Swimwear turned into a business in 2013, after completing school and receiving a Bachelor's Degree in Fashion Design from Miami International University of Art and Design, my skill set had become more refined, and the designs began to market themselves as special occasion swimsuits. K8 Swimwear's target customers include  brides, bachelorettes, festival goers, anyone anticipating a  special occasion that involves water. </p>
<p>After graduation, I worked full time as graphic designer for a corporate company, which allowed very minimal time to run K8 Swimwear.  During this time, Monday-Friday, I would focus on learning additional skills such as packaging, project proposals, mood boards, working amongst a team, and weekends were dedicated to crafting custom swimsuits. As K8 Swimwear began gaining traction in 2016, I set out on my own and began working various freelance positions to fund all K8 Swimwear projects. The company has been completely self funded up until this point. </p>
<p>Every aspect of K8 Swimwear from illustration, packaging, pattern making, production, graphic design, social media content has been done solely by myself with the help of many photographers/videographers/stylists assisting in creating content along the way. All swimsuits are handmade, one of a kind pieces crafted specifically to clients measurements and specifications. Clients typically choose an already existing style and are provided with a measurement form, as well as coverage/fabrication options to begin the custom swimsuit design process. The option to design a completely custom suit from scratch is available with additional charges. Because the suits are made custom to clients measurements, and given the 4-way stretch fabric, the possibility of a poor fit is very low. Alterations are offered, but rarely needed.  </p>
<p>K8 Swimwear has now moved into Southern California, operating locally in Los Angeles. The main goal for K8 Swimwear is to preserve the custom made element of the brand but to also create a manufactured line that can be accessible to a larger audience in hopes of expanding into upscale boutiques throughout Los Angeles and Miami. </p>

I am Kate Broadrick, Designer of K8 Swimwear. Creativity has been my main outlet since I can remember- creating garments began with safety pinning seams together, to where I am today, handcrafting swimsuits. My love for design dialed in on swimwear when I moved to Miami for school at 19 years old. Insecurities led me to only step foot on the beach if I could wear my push up bra. I began draping the bra in fabric and creating matching bottoms. With the help of Instagram, I began posting and before I knew it I was taking orders. Bless those of you who purchased the original K8 ""flow top""- The construction was less than ideal. It wasn't until I was asked to create a full line for a fashion show that I really felt the fruits of my labor. I decided to let go of the push up bra and design off of the natural silloutte. When I saw these women lined up, all different body shapes, huge smiles, feeling incredibly sexy, I knew this was it. I wanted every woman to feel this, to feel honored, and celebrated in their skin. 

K8 Swimwear turned into a business in 2013, after completing school and receiving a Bachelor's Degree in Fashion Design from Miami International University of Art and Design, my skill set had become more refined, and the designs began to market themselves as special occasion swimsuits. K8 Swimwear's target customers include  brides, bachelorettes, festival goers, anyone anticipating a  special occasion that involves water. 
After graduation, I worked full time as graphic designer for a corporate company, which allowed very minimal time to run K8 Swimwear.  During this time, Monday-Friday, I would focus on learning additional skills such as packaging, project proposals, mood boards, working amongst a team, and weekends were dedicated to crafting custom swimsuits. As K8 Swimwear began gaining traction in 2016, I set out on my own and began working various freelance positions to fund all K8 Swimwear projects. The company has been completely self funded up until this point. 
Every aspect of K8 Swimwear from illustration, packaging, pattern making, production, graphic design, social media content has been done solely by myself with the help of many photographers/videographers/stylists assisting in creating content along the way. All swimsuits are handmade, one of a kind pieces crafted specifically to clients measurements and specifications. Clients typically choose an already existing style and are provided with a measurement form, as well as coverage/fabrication options to begin the custom swimsuit design process. The option to design a completely custom suit from scratch is available with additional charges. Because the suits are made custom to clients measurements, and given the 4-way stretch fabric, the possibility of a poor fit is very low. Alterations are offered, but rarely needed.  
K8 Swimwear has now moved into Southern California, operating locally in Los Angeles. The main goal for K8 Swimwear is to preserve the custom made element of the brand but to also create a manufactured line that can be accessible to a larger audience in hopes of expanding into upscale boutiques throughout Los Angeles and Miami.

<h2><strong>My Story</strong></h2>
<p>I am a 29 year old dad (to Elio, who is 1 month old), a husband and dog owner. I live in Copenhagen, Denmark, but grew up in the mountains in Italy, where I am from originally. And I happened to be trans. </p>
<p>I discovered the gym and bodybuilding – it has been my sanctuary ever since. I am both marble and sculptor. Empowering – the power of the mind and the power of the body. All that needs to change is the mindset and it is this that I am trying to teach people. All bodies are beautiful. All minds.</p>
<p>As an alien on the wrong planet. As an albatross – elegant and majestic in the skies, but unsuited when on a boat among the fishermen. The dark years came when I became a teenager. Depression held me in its arms many times during those years.</p>
<p>Then this happened: at 17 years old, I found out that being trans is a thing and many feel the same way.</p>
<p> At 23 years old, I moved to Copenhagen – thirsty for a more open-minded environment, full of opportunities.</p>
<p>After 2 years of sessions and physical checks, I got approved:</p>
<p>June 2015: testosterone started.</p>
<p>September 2015: top-surgery happened.</p>
<p>I came out in front of more than a hundred students on the first day of the semester at university – they told me I am brave. But is it to be brave when you need to do something? Is it courage when it’s about survival? Since then my strength has come back. My pride has grown, my self-esteem has sky-rocketed, my life has become something I love – not something I simply live.</p>

<h3>The Montero Philosophy</h3>
<p>Our lives have changed in the last few years; we carry a lot more gadgets &amp; accessories than we used to in the past. And we are always on the move. As a working professional, being able to stay organized with this growing number of gadgets, and accommodating them in the same bag was becoming a challenge. That is why we designed the Montero - a smart, elegant, everyday office bag to help you stay organized and keep up with the pace of growth.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1606635866/y3lgd9fvv5szvaapa3b8.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Our philosophy of designing the Montero was to help working professionals to <i>De-clutter</i>, <i>Stay organized</i> and thus <i>De-stress to </i>have a good <i>work-life balance.</i></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><i>""Get Organized. De-stress your life.""</i></h3>
<p> </p>
<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>We are a startup (<a href=""http://www.urbanpik.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.urbanpik.com</a>) founded by a group of friends who came together as thinkers, product designers, visualizers and craftsmen. It was on a coffee one evening we were discussing how, as working professionals, it is embarrassing to enter into a meeting, or land up at the office desk, and pull out a mesh of entangled cables from the bag, and then try to stay organized. That's when we decided to get ourselves organized, and thus, de-stress our lives. What culminated over the next few days was the Montero.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1606635997/vjdbc1zv2ij5wjh3elwh.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>It took us 3 months to get our first prototype done. When we started using this prototype, we got more and more inquiries from friends, colleagues and well-wishers, to supply them with one. This is when we knew this was something which everyone needed. After 4 months of testing and collecting feedback, we knew what all needed to build into the Montero. With a few requests from friends for supplying the Montero to them, we set out to find the best partner who could produce this for us. 8 months and 15 prototypes later, we had the final product ready.</p>

<h3>Value, Style, Durability - The 3 pillars of our Design</h3>
<p>During our journey of Montero, we relied on 3 design principles - to offer <strong>Value</strong>, make it <strong>Stylish</strong> and create a <strong>Durable </strong>product. This makes the Montero resilient, practically manufacturable at scale, usable by both women and men, and a product which can last really long.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Value Montero Offers</h3>
<p>With the changing times, there arose a need to design products for today and for the future. While everything around has changed and moves at pace, our bags had stayed the same. Montero is the bag of the future, which has been thoughtfully designed to accommodate all your everyday gadgets smartly into a well-organized way. Whether you <strong>work from home</strong> or go to office, the Montero is your way to stay organized and strike a work-life balance.</p>
<p>The Montero has been thoughtfully designed to address today's needs of working professionals:</p>

</div></div>","The Montero Philosophy
Our lives have changed in the last few years; we carry a lot more gadgets & accessories than we used to in the past. And we are always on the move. As a working professional, being able to stay organized with this growing number of gadgets, and accommodating them in the same bag was becoming a challenge. That is why we designed the Montero - a smart, elegant, everyday office bag to help you stay organized and keep up with the pace of growth.

Our philosophy of designing the Montero was to help working professionals to De-clutter, Stay organized and thus De-stress to have a good work-life balance.
""Get Organized. De-stress your life.""
 
Our Story
We are a startup (www.urbanpik.com) founded by a group of friends who came together as thinkers, product designers, visualizers and craftsmen. It was on a coffee one evening we were discussing how, as working professionals, it is embarrassing to enter into a meeting, or land up at the office desk, and pull out a mesh of entangled cables from the bag, and then try to stay organized. That's when we decided to get ourselves organized, and thus, de-stress our lives. What culminated over the next few days was the Montero.

It took us 3 months to get our first prototype done. When we started using this prototype, we got more and more inquiries from friends, colleagues and well-wishers, to supply them with one. This is when we knew this was something which everyone needed. After 4 months of testing and collecting feedback, we knew what all needed to build into the Montero. With a few requests from friends for supplying the Montero to them, we set out to find the best partner who could produce this for us. 8 months and 15 prototypes later, we had the final product ready.

 
""Best companion to Work-from-anywhere""
 
Value, Style, Durability - The 3 pillars of our Design
During our journey of Montero, we relied on 3 design principles - to offer Value, make it Stylish and create a Durable product. This makes the Montero resilient, practically manufacturable at scale, usable by both women and men, and a product which can last really long.
 
The Value Montero Offers
With the changing times, there arose a need to design products for today and for the future. While everything around has changed and moves at pace, our bags had stayed the same. Montero is the bag of the future, which has been thoughtfully designed to accommodate all your everyday gadgets smartly into a well-organized way. Whether you work from home or go to office, the Montero is your way to stay organized and strike a work-life balance.
The Montero has been thoughtfully designed to address today's needs of working professionals:


The Laptop section: This section fits a standard 14″ or 15″ laptop, charger, tablet and other accessories like mouse, etc. 

The Bagnizer section: The Bagnizer section is designed to organize and store all the everyday essentials. It has tabs to fit mobile phone charging cables & earphones, has a pen & watch holder, and contains pockets to house power bank and mobile phones designed in a way that the phone can be easily charged using the power bank. 

The Travelizer section: The Travelizer section has been designed for those on the move. It fits your Passport, glasses, A5 notebook, SIM & SD cards, Business Cards and other travel related stuff. It has a slip pocket to easily slide it over a standard trolley bag 

Magnetic Zip Snapper: The magnetic zip snapper holds the zip head in the right position, and ensures you find it at the right place all the time


 
""Smart, Spacious Bag. No frills.""
 
Quality
Quality is extremely important in our quest to produce products which leave a lasting impression. It was for this that we took over a 12 months to finalize our product, carefully testing each feature we built into the bag. Some of the key quality aspects of Montero are:


100% Pure Leather for long-lasting bag life


Hand Crafted: Hand-sewn and machine-stitched for extra durability. The Buckles, Zippers and Holders are Internally Lined with Strong nylon fabric that makes them highly durable and long lasting


Stain and water-proof inner lining for rugged use


Rust-proof hardware for all-weather use 

High quality YKK zipper for super-smooth performance: The bags are fitted with full-perimeter, high quality, YKK zipper to offer a super-smooth experience.


 
""Handcrafted Product Mastery""
 
Style
Elegance is the hallmark of our design. We just don't design products, but beautiful products. Especially keeping in mind the fact that your bag represents your personality, it has been designed eloquently to suit every personality, for both women and men.

 

 
""For HER. For HIM.""
 
Working from Home or Commute to Office
Staying organized in your worklife is equally important as doing any other work in your job.  We spend a large part of our day trying to stay organized. Research shows that an unorganized environment can increase our stress levels and affect our work-life balance. 
Montero is your way to stay organized, regardless of whether you travel to office everyday, or work from home.

Why Are We on Indiegogo?
After the initial rave reviews we received for the Montero, we wanted to take this product to the world In order to help us simplify and organize the working professional's everyday lives. And for this we need to raise $12,500 to produce this bag at commercial scale. This money will be used for us to carry out the tooling, further research and produce the bag the way we have envisaged it as a product.
During this journey, we also realized that there are other products which can be designed along the lines of Montero, and we have already started to explore those. Your support here will help us bring more of such products to life and help you de-stress, de-clutter and stay organized
In order for us to grow at scale, we need to buy a manufacturing capacity so that the products can be manufactured at scale. The money raised here shall be used partly to buy such a capacity.

 

Risks & Challenges
We have already completed the prototyping, production and dispatch of the first batch of Montero, which was primarily for a group of close friends and colleagues. The challenges faced in manufacturing have been ironed out. It is with this experience that we are coming to you and offering this product.
As of date, there is no risk related to manufacturing of Montero and other products being offered here; however, the only risk we foresee is force majeure  - a Covid-19 like lock-down which may delay the deliveries and which is beyond our control. To mitigate this risk to a certain extent, we have a small quantity of stock available, which has been manufactured from the earnings of our first batch. This is our faith in the product that we know there will be buyers for Montero across the world, and which is why we reinvested our earnings to produce more bags.
We have consciously ensured not to add any fancy frills or technology elements which usually take a long time to manufacture and are prone to higher risks. This has further elminated R&D, Manufacturing, Shipping and tech-failure risks.
