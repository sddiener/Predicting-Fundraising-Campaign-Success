<p>Born and raised in Bel Air, Maryland, I moved to New York City when I was 18 and was captivated by the culture and life of a place that until that point had been some unachievable Narnia, where legends are made and most fade into obscurity. </p>
<p>I started a band called ""Schucks Road"", and we recorded and released an EP called 'One By Land'. For me, it was one of the crowning achievements of my life. For so long I had wanted to make something meaningful, and it was an incredible feeling to have completed such a cathartic journey. We received fantastic reviews, made some wonderful new fans, and performed on stages where our heroes had stood years ago. </p>
<p>If you know me, then you know that Schucks Road eventually ran its course, as did my time in New York City. I left to return to Baltimore, taking with me the experiences and the sounds of the past six years spent in a city that once felt unattainable.</p>
<p>Looking to new horizons, I'm heading to Los Angeles, and I want to take this collection of songs with me. Every song on this EP means a whole lot to me, and I hope that upon listening, they'll mean a lot to you as well. They are a culmination of my experiences in New York, my life in Baltimore, those I've known, the things I've lost, and the things I've gained. They tell a story about rising back up, no matter how hard you fall. I need for them to be heard, and I can only do it with your help.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>Without you, none of this will be possible. We've been hard at work in a beautiful studio on Long Island crafting, creating, and recording these songs. Help us bring them to you. To help you understand the cost, this is where the money will be used:</p> <ul> <li>Studio time for recording.</li> <li>Paying session musicians so that we can have the best sounding record possible. This includes drums, strings, brass instruments, and more. We're going big on this EP.</li>
<li>Mixing and mastering the album to give it the radio-quality sound.</li>
<li>Creation of merchandise, pressing of CDs, and maintenance of the website. </li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>

<span><span>A melodic guitar driven band with haunting lyrics that burn
right through you. They have been compared to the likes of Oasis, Death Cab For

likenesses in their music but as their fans well know, they are their own
animal with a very unique and polished sound that is captivating. </span><br/>
<br/>
<span>What makes The Show such a special band? The stranger
dichotomy of two polar opposite singer songwriters born on opposite sides of
The US. One from the deserts of the West and the other from the rich haunted woods of the East. The marriage of words and music seems an unlikely fit but it
works effortlessly. To complete them is the unstoppable rhythm section that
keeps the blood pumping. </span><br/>
<br/>
<span>They have played anywhere they can. Reaching as far as the </span>UK and Ireland. What you might not know about the
show is that everything that they've taken on, they have done alone. No label,
no financial backing. They work day jobs. They have sacrificed greatly to keep
this wonderful music coming to their fans. They know fans are the very life
force of what your band is capable of doing. Those wonderful fans have helped them accomplish so much. Their campaign video has just a few of the countless
testimonies from there incredibly loyal fans. </span><br/>
<br/>
<span>I am honored to call myself a fan of The Show and not be
able to contribute financially, they have done me the deep honor in letting me
contribute in the best way that I know how. With my humble words. I hope from
the bottom of my heart that you get them to Music Week in Austin Texas! Home of

My mother would sing Ukrainian folk songs to me and they tell me when I first started speaking I would sing the words instead of speaking the words, they still tell me to this day how crazy it drove them that I would sing my words instead of speaking :)) On my 10th birthday my father bought me an old German Piano more than 100 years old this piano I still have and have spent many hours playing and writing music. My music teacher realized my passion and talent for music and put me on a fast track getting my creative mind working very well. In 1999 I wrote my first song for piano it was a classical song. In 2001 I start to play acoustic guitar by ear and write songs in English. In 2002 I began to perform at live events, some were charity events, some were at church events and some were in the local theater concert hall, it was every fun for me at this time in my life, but I did not make any money from my performances. In 2004 I started to play electric guitar and write songs for guitars. <br/></p>

 any other cool crazy way to let people know about this campaign. And if
 you come up with a cool idea let us know maybe it will earn you a good 
perk if my manager likes it.<br/><br/></b><p></p>
<p><b>Charity work.</b><br/>My moms friend Zina had a daughter Natasha  who had Cerebral palsy even though their were some organizations to help parents with children that had special needs there were not any organizations that focused specifically on cerebral palsy. Growing up with Natasha I felt a special urge to try and help her as much as I could. This is what lead me to participate in my first charity concert. Because of Natasha's needs and because Natasha was like a sister. Me, my Mom and Zina  decided to form a non-profit charity that focused on kids with cerebral palsy. The organization's name is Triada because three of us - me, my mom and Zina. The website is <a href=""http://fondtriada.at.ua"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://fondtriada.at.ua</a> or check CBF Triada non-profit community organization Facebook page.<br/>During this time I had many charity concerts to bring awareness of this crippling disease, but also to raise money and to get donations for medical equipment like wheel chairs and other equipment to help them exercise and strengthen there arms and legs. We also provided computer classes to educate disabled children and adults to use computers and be more social on internet. Triada organized festivals for disabled children and adults so they could make their dreams come true and show their talents by singing on stage. I petitioned the Cherkasy city government to asset with these concerts and to help with the needs of these children. This paid off very well we were able to get better medical treatment for these children, the charity assisted in providing food from our donors and I received inspirations for many songs during this time. We also received many award recognition for our work from the government. If you want to know more about my BIO and charity work read on my facebook page.<br/></p>
<p><b>Why I moved to USA?</b><br/>At one charity event I met David Cunningham (producer/director) who was in Ukraine on business, he was looking at locations for a movie and just happen to show up at our concert. I was already planning to do an album of my songs in Kiev, but David offered to pay for studio rental in Kiev if I donated a part of the proceeds from the sales of the CD/album back to the Charity. Of course I said ""yes"" this was like a dream come true, but before we could record David had a family emergency and had to return to California. A few months later David came back and we went to Kiev to record the album. The organization had more charity concerts and it was at this time we were able to get some Ukrainian celebrities to participate. I received advice from many of them if I did an album in English it would not sell very well in Ukraine, they said that I was at least ten years ahead of my time, this was very disappointing to me. I was at a cross roads, either I had to sing in Ukrainian so my album would have half a chance of selling or I had to come to America and pursue my American Dream. Well you know what happened I am here in the USA making my music. During this time I was living in USA I was fortunate to work as photo model, actress in commercials and comedy videos.</p>
<p>To improve my singing abilities I have worked with American Idol, X-Factor vocal coach Monica Margolis.<br/></p>
<p>I have produced two music videos ""It is not my War"" and ""Titanium/Pavane"" The Piano Guys cover. Check my Youtube channel. <br/></p>
<p>Miracles  of Life<br/></p>
<p>First miracle birth of creature, I was the first baby that survived out of four, I had two older sisters and an older brother that all died in infancy. I was born pre-mature, coming into this earth smaller than a doll. When I was 18 months old I became very ill. Doctors told my parents that I had an immune system virus and that I needed a blood transfusion immediately or I would die. My father was professor in college so he asked his students to come and donate blood for me. I recovered from that and had no other problems until I was 14 and began entering my adolescence  years. At school the common practice was the nurse would give all students a medical examination to make sure we as children were developing correctly. The doctors became very concerned with my breast. The breast tissue was very hard and the doctors suspected I had cancerous tumors in my breast.  With the blood disorder I had at 18 months and now this they speculated that I had come into contamination from some of the Chernobyl fallout even though we lived far from the explosion. They did all kinds of test and could not establish that it was cancer or what was the hard tissue. My girlfriends always teased me that I had man boobs because they were so hard and firm. They would tease me in a fun way as kids do that I was a creature from outer space, but the way I was starting to grow it wasn't only my breast that were different but my hip bones were also out of place than normal teenager. You can imagine at this point my mind was telling me I really was different creature. Growing up with Natasha and her handicaps we formed the first CREATURE CLUB, I was big creature and she was little creature.</p>
<p>Second miracle is the gift of tongues/language with just basic understanding and speaking English language I received inspiration on lyrics and melody in English. I didn't understand what I was writing so I took the transcripts to some Americans at church that were visiting and asked them to tell me if what I wrote was proper. The American's said everything was written correctly and it was a very good song.This gift was given to me at the same time I set up the charity. For the longest time I thought why did I understand and learn in English, then I understood when I came to America it was because I was coming to America.</p>
<p>Third miracle is I met David Cunningham and he brings me to USA. Now David is my manager. When I first arrived David took me to doctors to have my health checked. When I was child I had my adenoids taken out, and have had some nasal problems ever since (two times I broke my nose), so one doctor looked at my nose to fix it, another doctor checked everything else and on his report he wrote that ""he never seen before hip bones 2 inches higher than normal"" this doctor also examined my breast and confirmed there was no lumps or tumors, but just very solid breast tissue, and it was attached to my chest in different, not usual way. He said that he never seen before boobs are growing in weird way :)) So I commented on that, that I'm not surprised, because I'm a Creature :)))  </p>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">My name is Leviticus Thomas.  Originally from Florence, AL, I started playing the piano by ear at the age of 3 years old and now have more than 30+ years of experience in gospel music.  While in Washington, DC I served as the Director of the Georgetown University Gospel Choir for almost 5 years (2001-2006).  In addition to the honor of sharing the stage with some awesome musicians and dignitaries at the Kennedy Center, GUGC and the Children's Choir of the Washington Performing Arts Society (DC) have been blessed to render some of my original pieces over the years.  Also one of my songs was chosen in the Gospel Music Workshop of America New Music Seminar 2013 where I was blessed to present music at the GMWA National Convention held in Cincinnati, Ohio.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><b>PRESENT</b></span></p>
<p>I am a singer-songwriter, worship pastor, minister of music, teacher, coach, husband and father, who simply loves GOD and desires to do more for HIM.  I am now back in Huntsville, AL attending graduate school at my alma mater, Alabama A&amp;M University, where I am blessed to serve as Worship Pastor at Madison Worship Center and prepare my group, Joyful Noise, for the awesome journey GOD has set before us.  GOD has blessed me with some wonderfully anointed songs that I am compelled to record and release to ultimately help spread the gospel message all over the world.  With lyrics based out of the Holy Bible, a fresh sound, and relevant message destined to make an immediate impact on the world we live in today, I know that I am called to do music ministry and fully acknowledge that GOD has birthed this awesome gift in me, even in my mother's womb before I was ever thought of.  It has been a long time coming, but I recognize my limitations in attempting to do all of this on my own and therefore need your love, prayers, support and financial contributions to finally help me see this CD recording and release come to fruition (for GOD's glory).</p>
<p><b>FUTURE</b></p>
<p>Your monetary support will help off set many of the expenses associated with a CD recording and release of this magnitude.  Your contributions will help pay for the pre- and post-production costs (, etc) for the debut gospel music CD by Leviticus Thomas &amp; Joyful Noise.  No donation is too small or too large.  I promise to be a good steward over the funds you entrust me with as we do our part in building GOD's kingdom.  THANKS in advance for pouring into this music ministry.  We look forward to you getting on board with this awesome movement of GOD!!!  Please join the fellowship, partner with us and help us SPREAD THE WORD, SPREAD SOME JOY.  Make a JOYFUL NOISE unto the LORD!!!</p>

My name is Leviticus Thomas.  Originally from Florence, AL, I started playing the piano by ear at the age of 3 years old and now have more than 30+ years of experience in gospel music.  While in Washington, DC I served as the Director of the Georgetown University Gospel Choir for almost 5 years (2001-2006).  In addition to the honor of sharing the stage with some awesome musicians and dignitaries at the Kennedy Center, GUGC and the Children's Choir of the Washington Performing Arts Society (DC) have been blessed to render some of my original pieces over the years.  Also one of my songs was chosen in the Gospel Music Workshop of America New Music Seminar 2013 where I was blessed to present music at the GMWA National Convention held in Cincinnati, Ohio.
PRESENT
I am a singer-songwriter, worship pastor, minister of music, teacher, coach, husband and father, who simply loves GOD and desires to do more for HIM.  I am now back in Huntsville, AL attending graduate school at my alma mater, Alabama A&M University, where I am blessed to serve as Worship Pastor at Madison Worship Center and prepare my group, Joyful Noise, for the awesome journey GOD has set before us.  GOD has blessed me with some wonderfully anointed songs that I am compelled to record and release to ultimately help spread the gospel message all over the world.  With lyrics based out of the Holy Bible, a fresh sound, and relevant message destined to make an immediate impact on the world we live in today, I know that I am called to do music ministry and fully acknowledge that GOD has birthed this awesome gift in me, even in my mother's womb before I was ever thought of.  It has been a long time coming, but I recognize my limitations in attempting to do all of this on my own and therefore need your love, prayers, support and financial contributions to finally help me see this CD recording and release come to fruition (for GOD's glory).
FUTURE
Your monetary support will help off set many of the expenses associated with a CD recording and release of this magnitude.  Your contributions will help pay for the pre- and post-production costs (, etc) for the debut gospel music CD by Leviticus Thomas & Joyful Noise.  No donation is too small or too large.  I promise to be a good steward over the funds you entrust me with as we do our part in building GOD's kingdom.  THANKS in advance for pouring into this music ministry.  We look forward to you getting on board with this awesome movement of GOD!!!  Please join the fellowship, partner with us and help us SPREAD THE WORD, SPREAD SOME JOY.  Make a JOYFUL NOISE unto the LORD!!!

I was born in to a musical family and raised in the rural Chilcotin region of BC.I had a dream and set out on my journey at the age of 13 when I picked up the guitar and started writing songs. My professional music career started in 1999 when I got a loan and recorded my debut album at Magic Lab Studios in Surrey, BC with producer John Ellis at the helm. I released the record in Feb 2000. I was a single mom at the time so it took me longer to achieve my goals but I just included my girls in to my life and slowly inched along my path.

While raising my family, educating myself and working various contracts, I wrote songs...




...and recorded...

...and toured...
In 2005 me and my girls moved to a quaint little place nestled at the base of the north shore mountains along BC's beautiful west coast.I went on to release 2 more albums and 2 singles and celebrated some achievements.




And I was fortunate enough to be included in some very special musical projects along the way that lifted me to dimensions that I only ever dreamed about.My daughters Hailey, Jaycie and Holley are all grown up now. Hailey went through college last year to become an Early Childhood Educator and is now working in her field. Jaycie graduated from high school last year with dreams of traveling the world. She is working at Starbucks to save money for her travels and was recently promoted to Shift Supervisor. Holley is in grade 10 and is currently exploring the possibilities of her future. 
And me, well, a whole new world is ahead of me and I'm ready to leap!

I've written my 4th album A Woman Like Me and it's my best work yet. I'd like nothing better than to hit the road to come and play for you with this new album in my hand. I've been working hard trying to get it done (and I know my fans have been patiently waiting - thank you for that) but truth is, I just can't manage the costs of producing an album on my own this time, so I'm reaching out for help.


Here's What I Need & Why
 In Nov/Dec 2014 I ran my first crowd funding campaign and boy did I learn a lot.  With the help from 53 contributors, we had enough to get the project off the ground. On Feb 11, 2015, me and my amazing creative team (Geoff Hicks on drums, Rob Becker on bass, Scott Smith on steel/dobro and Eric Reed on mando, electric guitar and the Neve 8078 console) recorded two songs for this album - Home and Just You & Me. 

Now I'm ready for Session 2 & 3 where we will record 4 more songs in April/May.

Here's the breakdown:
Studio (includes engineer & hospitality for these hard working men) - $1,400Assistant Engineer - $400Musicians - $3,200
TOTAL FOR SESSION 2 & 3 = $5,000
If we surpass the goal (which would be awesome), then I will record as much as I can with what's available. If we surpass the goal by light years, then I will finish recording the album and carry on to mix, master, manufacture and market it too! Wouldn't that be spectacular! 
If we don't reach the goal, I'll do what I can with what is raised and inch along as I've always done. Slow and steady wins the race!

What You GetI believe that beyond your contribution, you should have the option of receiving something in return, so I've put together some perks for you to consider.Here are some details on a few of the more unique ones:

This is what the mug's look like. This particular one was gifted to a special contributor from my last campaign!

Formé en 2012, Nothingness Theory a tout pour réussir.
Le groupe travaille fort pour créer de la musique qui ne les enferme pas
simplement dans le stéreotype du Métal Symphonique féminin actuel, mais essaie
d’innover dans cette catégorie telle que leur prédécesseurs Evanescence,
Nightwish et Lacuna Coil; la voix de Karine, la qualité des musiciens et
l’orchestration symphonique offre une atomosphère intriguante et lourde!
Actuellement Nothingness Theory est en studio pour la production de leur
premier album. Les membres de Nothingness Theory sont: Karine - Voix, Dany-
Lead Guitares, Luca - Guitares rythmiques, Phil - Basse et Fred - Batterie.

With his smooth singing voice and his aggressive yet tasteful flow, Trez wants his music to make people feel something when they listen to it. He wants people to be able to nod their heads and/or dance to his music, but also be able to relate to the lyrics of the songs. Finishing up college at Belmont University in Nashville, TN, Trez takes music serious and is determined to make it. Lost his biggest fan, his brother, Deremy in 2014 and won’t stop going until he makes him proud. This campaign will help me do that. Just by contributing  to this campaign, you guys will help jump-start my career and be a step closer to making my dream come true.  <br/></p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>
<p>I am raising money to fund my debut album “Subject Matter”. It is a R&amp;B/Hip-Hop album with live instrumentation and programming. I am using professionals so this project can sound as best as possible. This project will also be shopped to labels and I need them to believe that I can compete with any other star out there. Working with some of the best musicians, producers, and engineers in TN to make some “real” R&amp;B and great Hip-Hop tracks touching on topics we all deal with in life. You won’t be disappointed when this project is finished.</p>
<p>I just want to make great, timeless, and quality music and to do that you need MONEY (for example, studio costs, paying the musicians, mixing, mastering, and post production costs like marketing and promotion). I know you guys will support me because many of you have been supporting me thus far. For your kind contributions, I have fun perks and giveaways (like free music, private concerts, vinyl copies of the music, and many more). Once you donate the money will come out immediately. If i do not reach the entire goal, I will just have to pay a higher percentage back to indiegogo. Thanks in advance for what you’re going to do.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>I am blessed to even be in the position to share my God given gift with all of you. I know that if you don’t invest in yourself nobody will and that’s why I am giving my all to show you guys I am worth the investment. A lot of modern R&amp;B/Hip-Hop is all about sex, drugs, fast life, and violence but my music is filled with inspiration, love, pain, and enjoying life. “Subject Matter” will be something everyone in the family can listen to; from the kids to the parents. Many of you like the songs I've put out, so this will just allow me to have a body of work full of songs you guys will like.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>Anybody that has been this road (making music a career) has had many obstacles come that could have threw them off track and made them chose a different career. But, when music is what you were put on this Earth to do, like it is for me, then nothing can stand in the way of that. God put me on this Earth to spread love and positive messages through my music. I don’t go a day without writing a song or wishing that I could do what I love, inspire people, and live comfortably from it all at the same time. Problems will arise, but there is always sunshine after the storm and I know that those problems won’t last always. My passion for my music will last longer than any obstacle that is thrown my way and as long as I have God, my family, and you guys (my supporters) I know everything will be ok. Challenges will just make me stronger and more equipped to do what I’ve always done….Music!<br/></p>

<p>Welcome to my first crowdfunding. My name is Sean Roberts, I'm a singer/songwriter here in Southern California who is committed to run my career in direct partnership with the community of people who support my music<strong>.</strong> In the last 15 years I have released 6 albums - including 2 solo, one with Syrius South (a country duo with one of my friends) and 3 with the comedy band Bob Knows Best.</p>
<p>Now after 5 years since my last solo album it time to make another one and I want you to be a part of it. I do have a distribution deal with a small indie label but that means they just help me get my music on iTunes or Amazon.com. I still need to spend my own money on studio time, other musicians,  mixing, mastering, graphics and manufacturing of this new album.  This is where I would like you to be apart of this new project.</p>
<p> I've done all of my albums on my own, out 
of my little home studio. I don’t even have a 
publicist at the moment. This is a true grass-roots thing that’s 
happening. It’s overwhelming and it’s amazing and I could not be more 
grateful. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Why I Need Your Support &amp; What You Get</h3>
</div><div> <p>I believe that music can really bring a positive vibe and I want to share it with as many people as I can.  With that in mind I needed to take my music production to the next level. So I have asked mixing engineer Joshua Brooks of ReAmp Studios in Tustin, Ca to help mix my album for me. As an artist, I always my my next album to sound better than the last. With the right people in my corner I will be able to achieve this goal. This is where your funding will help. Whatever I raise I am putting directly back 
into getting this message out into the world. <br/></p>
<p>Record labels spend an average of $500,000 on recording, producing and
printing an album for a new artist, and even more to promote them. Thanks to my wonderful creative friends who
believe in my music, I have been able to cut those costs drastically, and I
would like to reward my collaborators for the time and creativity they have
shared on my behalf. After thoroughly evaluating different vendor options,
negotiating and trading favors, and revisiting my budget several times, I will need to raise only $5,000 in
order to get ""The Upside of Heartache"" to your
eyes and ears anywhere in the world.<br/></p>
<p>My expenses will consist of mixing the album, mastering the album, cover design and the manufacturing of the album.  I do want to make sure that I offer you a chance to be part of this with me. How cool would it be to have your name on the album and your contribution helping to create a new and exciting album for all to enjoy!</p>
<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>In a world of high powered labels and Clear Channel Radio, I have seen the demand for independent music across this country because people like you want to hear original music that comes from the heart. Once I get this album released I will be headed out to do a Home Concert
 Tour this summer. This means that I will be bringing all of my music to you in a
 more intimate way, right in your living rooms, up front and close. Understand that any contribution from hundreds of people can  go a long way. I would value even the smallest donation.<br/></p>
<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>There are always risks, but if you don't take
them, you will never succeed. Making this campaign is a huge challenge for me; if I
don't meet our goal it would be embarrassing and my hopes would be completely
dashed. I am counting on my friends and fans more than ever, to spread the word and to help me
achieve this goal! <br/> </p>
<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>
</p>
<p>Are you as broke as I'm about to
be? No problem.</p>

I understand if you can't contribute to the project
today. However, I encourage you to please share this campaign with all  your friends through your Facebook, Twitter accounts and email.  Share my website <a href=""http://www.seanroberts.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.seanroberts.net</a> and my video with your friends. Let your friends know why you think I am worthy of their help. There
are Indiegogo ""Share"" buttons all over this page, so all it takes is a couple
clicks and you've helped more than you could know.<p><br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>Lastly</h3>

Thank you SO much for your help. Whether you've
donated, shared, or even taken a look at this page, I appreciate it so much. I

  The Impact In a world of high powered labels and Clear Channel Radio, I have seen the demand for independent music across this country because people like you want to hear original music that comes from the heart. Once I get this album released I will be headed out to do a Home Concert
 Tour this summer. This means that I will be bringing all of my music to you in a
 more intimate way, right in your living rooms, up front and close. Understand that any contribution from hundreds of people can  go a long way. I would value even the smallest donation.

  Risks & Challenges There are always risks, but if you don't take
them, you will never succeed. Making this campaign is a huge challenge for me; if I
don't meet our goal it would be embarrassing and my hopes would be completely
dashed. I am counting on my friends and fans more than ever, to spread the word and to help me
achieve this goal!  

  Other Ways You Can Help 

Are you as broke as I'm about to
be? No problem.

I understand if you can't contribute to the project
today. However, I encourage you to please share this campaign with all  your friends through your Facebook, Twitter accounts and email.  Share my website www.seanroberts.net and my video with your friends. Let your friends know why you think I am worthy of their help. There
are Indiegogo ""Share"" buttons all over this page, so all it takes is a couple
clicks and you've helped more than you could know.


Lastly

Thank you SO much for your help. Whether you've
donated, shared, or even taken a look at this page, I appreciate it so much. I
wouldn't be here if it weren't for everyone who's helped along the way. I'm
truly thankful for that.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3> <p>Hi everyone, AJ here - thanks so much for checking out my Indiegogo page! </p>
<p>Music has been a part of my life for...well, my entire life. As soon as I could walk, I would stumble my way over to the family piano, hoist myself up onto the piano bench and perform. At the time, it was the random banging of keys, but I loved it.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1441719130/pqyuwnl10962joubhexy.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p> #fashionable</div><div>
<br/><p></p>
<p>Fast forward a lot of years and my obsession with learning how to play various instruments has brought my grand total to 8 (Piano, Violin, Guitar, Bass, Mandolin, Ukelele, Organ, and working on Drums). I've been writing songs since I was 10, co-wrote a #3 hit in Australia, opened for The Eagles, Lindsey Stirling, and more, but in order to truly share my music with the world, I need professional, radio-ready recordings.</p>
<p></p>

<p>And that brings us to the reason you're here...I'm excited to announce that I'm fortunate enough to be recording an EP (that could turn into a full-length album!) with GRAMMY-Winning Producer Scott Jacoby. The music we've made together so far is absolutely amazing, but I need your support to finish this project.</p>
<p>To give you a taste of one song that Scott and I have worked on together, check out the campaign video above for a sneak preview!</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>Recording, mixing, mastering, and releasing music professionally isn't cheap. I've already put in $4000 and am campaigning to raise $12,000 more which will cover the costs of creation and distribution of my 5-song EP. Here's a quick breakdown of the costs:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li> The actual recording and mixing of five songs - <b>$10,000+</b> </li>
<li>Cost of goods for perks (Poster pressing, etc) - <b>$1,500+</b>
</li>
<li>Promotional costs - <b>$2,500+ </b>
</li>
<li>IndieGogo &amp; Credit Card Processing Fees - <b>$2,000+</b>
</li>
</ul>
<div>In exchange for your support, I'm offering exclusive perks, some of which will only be available through this campaign. And I'm open to offering more too! My whole band is actually in and we want this fundraiser to bring us closer to our fans, friends, and family, so feel free to suggest a perk if you have an idea!</div>

bearing the stores, traditions and liquor that date back a century. This
 old-time band delivers with an intensity that would knock the sock’s 
right off of their forefathers feet.</p>
<p>Hailing from the back woods of Pewee Valley, Kentucky. Whiskey Bent 
Valley pay’s homage to their southern kin.Songs from the tobacco fields

 the instruments, their style and every authentic nuance of the day.

 silk vests, along with a turbo charged performance, their approach 
breathes fire into this vintage genre.</p>
<p>Incorporating time honored treasures from such icons as Roscoe 
Holcomb, The Stanley Brothers, and fiddle legend Tommy Jarrell, or a 
roster of original compositions including crowd-pleasers “Graveyard 
Blues” or “Shady River” the band puts on a timeless, energiezed show, 
Playing everything from ballads, breakdowns, sea shanties, and swamp 
stomps. Audiences from children on their parent’s knee to packed saloons
 past midnight ,and finding favor with the older generation as well 
makes for a wide range of appeal.</p>
<p>The boys take cues from parents and grandparents who have tapped into
 folk country and bluegrass through festivals, radio and endless 
collections of vinyl recrodings. Band founder Col. Mason Dixon hails 
from a long line of musicians and will tell you it’s not so much in the 
whiskey as it is the DNA. Each member’s family performs and enjoys the 
indigenous music of the appalachian foothills and pastures of Kentucky. </p>
<p>Appearances on a wide range of radio and tv programs, state fairs 
,square dance’s and festivals have brought them an active fan base for 
this region. Often times the boy’s bring a delicious yield of their 
summer crops to gigs in bushel baskets for the taking. Going even more 
down to earth, they are making their cd packaging “green.” All of their 
records are made from industrial hemp paper and recycled cardboard with 
environmentally-friendly, vegetable-based inks.</p>

outlets in the Bay Area are threatening our music community. Less media 
outlets means less room for coverage of smaller local artists who have 
trouble getting the attention of the mainstream press.<b></b></p><p><strong>This is where The Bay Bridged has taken a leading role in our community:</strong>
 For 10 years, The Bay Bridged has been covering the San Francisco Bay 
Area music scene with daily news, interviews, features, show reviews, 
podcasts, and mixtapes to millions around the nation. We also create, 
produce, and promote unique, low-cost concerts and festivals that put 
local artists on bigger stages and (as often as possible) in front of 
all-ages crowds.</p><p>Our readers know that our coverage isn’t driven by clicks or ad sales; 
it’s driven by a passion for excellent art — who else is going to write 
about that awesome and unheard Oakland band with no label and a 
three-song Bandcamp demo? It’s why we’ve been called the “Best Arts or 
Music Website” and “Best Music Blog” by the SF Weekly and the SF Bay 
Guardian repeatedly. And this is why our award-winning podcast series is
 syndicated through KQED.</p><h2>Why We Need You To Join Us</h2><p>It’s a critical time for Bay Area arts and music. Now more than ever, 
smaller artists need allies like The Bay Bridged to defend, promote, and
 protect Bay Area music. But as a volunteer-run organization, we still 
need your help to make 2016 our most impactful year yet. With you 
joining our Year-End Fundraiser, The Bay Bridged can:<b></b></p><ul>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Increase our writer compensation budget</strong> and begin <strong>accepting freelance articles</strong> at rates competitive with larger media organizations</li>
<li>Publish even more great <strong>in-depth features, opinion pieces, and mixtapes</strong>

nonprofit recognized nationwide as the leading source for San Francisco 
Bay Area independent music. The Bay Bridged is led by a group of 30-plus
 volunteers who work tirelessly (after our day jobs) to promote Bay Area
 arts and music through our award-winning music blog and podcast, as 
well as a series of acclaimed music festival events including Phono del 
Sol, The Bay Brewed, and formerly, Rock Make Music and Arts Street 
Festival. Over the last 10 years, our work has served to directly promote and support over 4,000 bands and musicians.Over the last 10 years, we've:

Showcased the best of San Francisco Bay Area music to over 5 million visitors on our web site
Brought over 80,000 attendees to festivals we've produced
Written over 8,000 articles about 4,000+ bands

Produced over 400 hours of podcasts
Presented and promoted over 200 shows around the Bay Area
It’s Time To Take The Bay Bridged To The Next LevelA high-cost of living (we know you know) and a shrinking pool of media 
outlets in the Bay Area are threatening our music community. Less media 
outlets means less room for coverage of smaller local artists who have 
trouble getting the attention of the mainstream press.This is where The Bay Bridged has taken a leading role in our community:
 For 10 years, The Bay Bridged has been covering the San Francisco Bay 
Area music scene with daily news, interviews, features, show reviews, 
podcasts, and mixtapes to millions around the nation. We also create, 
produce, and promote unique, low-cost concerts and festivals that put 
local artists on bigger stages and (as often as possible) in front of 
all-ages crowds.Our readers know that our coverage isn’t driven by clicks or ad sales; 
it’s driven by a passion for excellent art — who else is going to write 
about that awesome and unheard Oakland band with no label and a 
three-song Bandcamp demo? It’s why we’ve been called the “Best Arts or 
Music Website” and “Best Music Blog” by the SF Weekly and the SF Bay 
Guardian repeatedly. And this is why our award-winning podcast series is
 syndicated through KQED.Why We Need You To Join UsIt’s a critical time for Bay Area arts and music. Now more than ever, 
smaller artists need allies like The Bay Bridged to defend, promote, and
 protect Bay Area music. But as a volunteer-run organization, we still 
need your help to make 2016 our most impactful year yet. With you 
joining our Year-End Fundraiser, The Bay Bridged can:


Increase our writer compensation budget and begin accepting freelance articles at rates competitive with larger media organizations
Publish even more great in-depth features, opinion pieces, and mixtapes

Increase our resources to develop and produce future events like Phono del Sol and The Bay Brewed that support Bay Area music

</div><p><b>Short Summary</b></p>
<p>Hey guys, my name is <b>Shawn Perry</b> and chances
are if you are reading this you either know me, someone in the band or a fan of
one of my previous music projects. </p>
<p><b>Thanks for your enduring support. </b></p>
<p><b>The Skinny- </b></p>
<p>A little background on me and the band. I have been performing
professionally since I was 13. I was a former coach on the MTV series MADE, I
have done radio and films and I have shared the stage with many rock legends
over my career. My current project The Hazzard County Rebellion is a musical
gumbo full of all of my favorite aspects from modern country, outlaw country,
classic rock, pop and metal.... I am a huge sucker for happy rap... who knows
MC Hammer or Young MC might make a cameo on a rebellion track someday. </p>
<p><b>Why should YOU care?</b></p>
<p><i>The Rebellion is a pretty special thing both musically and
socially here is why- </i></p>
<p>Musically, this is my first foray into being a ""Solo""
artist. But the fact of the matter is pretty much every band I have even been
in I have been the one doing the lion's share of the work and the bulk of the
writing, so in many regards nothing has changed. The biggest reason for going
the ""Solo""  route is the freedom from having image and marketing
labels associated with being a ""Band"". Being a solo artist allows
alot more creative freedom, and it essentially neutralized any industry
""Image"" standards for the rest of the band, which if anybody reading
this has ever gone after a major recording contract, that kind of stuff is a
huge deal.... I have literally had A&amp;R reps from major labels say things
like they didn't like this guys hair, or that guys shoes and that they loved
our band and they would be interested in signing us if we sounded more like
(insert dumb BUTTROCK band here) or this guys looked more like this dude from some
other dumb band, that has since broken up since I sat down with that fool....
So taking all of those things off that table was very important to me-</p>
<p>That being said; however, this is probably the most functional
band I have ever been in so....go figure life is funny that way I guess. I have
purposely surrounded myself with people who are actually good people, fantastic
friends, and musical equals. Everyone in the band is EXTREMELY talented.
The band is made up of Grayson Latimore Jr. (Drums) Dave Romweber (Guitar) Kevin Thiede (Guitar) Melissa Willis (Bass) and Ayden Ash (Fiddle) </p>
<p> I am very blessed to call
them friends and bandmates. Collectively we have created a group that is sonically
and visually and bit of culture kaleidoscope.  The Rebellion is a
multicultural, multigenerational, multi gender cross section of America. With
that being the reality, I think it gives what we say in our music much more of
a voice and much more gravitas than your average rock and and more
that 99.9% of the country acts on the planet. Sure, we have songs about
whisky and chicken and all that noise but we also have songs and social
justice, income inequality, child abuse and other serious issues.  I
personally feel that we need to give those issues a voice, a loud voice- </p>
<p><b>Why Contributing is important</b></p>
<p>It's all about the fans! Fans make the music industry go round.
Fans make records, tours, cool merch and in this case music videos possible. If
you believe in bringing some rock and roll spectacle to country music; If
you believe in blurring color lines and the lines between
musical genres, and you believe in not only having a good time but saying
something important in the process then this is your chance to be a part of
something that we believe is truly unique and LITERALLY as American as
something possibly can be. We can't do what we do without your love
and support- </p>
<p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>Our budget for this video in <b><i>DIMINUTIVE</i></b> in the scheme
of things. We are only looking to raise $1000 to make this video. I doesn't
seem like a lot of money for a music video right? <b>....RIGHT!</b></p>
<p>Having lots of friends in this business we are able to get
things done MUCH, MUCH cheaper than the average bear can. This will be a
professional broadcast music video similar to the ones my other bands have done
in the past... here is an example done on a similar budget, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFdQIQVQ-ak"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFdQIQVQ-ak</a></p>
<p>100% of the cash raised for this video (minus the cost of the
perks) will go directly to the production of this video. If we go over that the
goal which hopefully we will, we will just make a bigger better video...we can
always buy more lights and add more explosions, and fry up more catfish...we
literally have <b><i>NO PROBLEM WITH THIS! </i></b></p>
<p><b><i>If for some reason we don't meet our goal on indigogo... the
video will still get made...it just might not be quite as awesome or one of us
might have to sell an organ on the black market....we would rather not do that.</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>Perks of contributing:</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>Gold Level </i></b></p>

company, I only make on average 5-10 guitars a year. The Chimera is my brand
new flagship model, the culmination of my entire life as a player and the last
four years running this company…It is 100% hand crafted by me and my team. The
street price on the guitar is $3900 so it’s already $1000 off the price. This
will be serial #3, Zero and 1 will be mine, #2 is already sold. The Winner will
choose the color stain of their choosing over a AAAA flame maple carved top and
the band will sign the WOOD! on the back before the guitar gets clear coat....

<p>Starting things off on the right foot is
important, we believe in this concept, this songs and above all else we believe
that YOU are going to enjoy what we are creating. A successful first
single/music video will open the doors to future videos, bigger shows and more
touring for the band. </p>

</div><span><span><br/></span></span><h3><span>Who am I..</span></h3><p>Hey guys!</p><p>My name is Hughes and I have been playing blues guitar ever since I was about 12 years old. I started on an old hand-me-down Les Paul guitar and learned my first chords off of a<b> bar napkin</b> from a local musician in my hometown of Macon, Ga. Ever since then, my life has been totally encompassed by music. </p><p>I started recording my first full-length LP over the summer, spending countless hours writing, playing, recording, and all else that goes into the long process of expressing myself through music. <b>Now I am reaching out to you in order to take it to the next level.</b> This album is <u>extremely important</u> to me because it is the first real step in advancing my dream of making a career out of making music.</p><p>I have already completed about <b>70%</b> of the album, and have set my starting goal at only <b>$5000 to complete recording, mastering, CD replication, artwork,</b> and other components that are <u>essential</u> in completing an album. I truly believe in this album and have poured my heart and soul into it. I know that <b>together, we will see my dream come to fruition. </b></p><p>I am fully aware that it takes much much more than this amount to really capture <u>everything</u> that goes into a new album project, so <b>I hope to reach $8000 as a stretch goal </b>in order to truly capture my vision with the highest of quality.</p><br/><p><b>Thank You</b> so much for all of the support that you, as my <b>friends, family, and fans, </b>have already given me. I know that with your help, paired with my hard work and dedication, <b>we will see my dream come to life!</b></p><p><b>Let's make an album!</b></p><br/><h3>Here's What is Needed...</h3><p><b>A lot</b> goes into making an album.

Who am I..Hey guys!My name is Hughes and I have been playing blues guitar ever since I was about 12 years old. I started on an old hand-me-down Les Paul guitar and learned my first chords off of a bar napkin from a local musician in my hometown of Macon, Ga. Ever since then, my life has been totally encompassed by music. I started recording my first full-length LP over the summer, spending countless hours writing, playing, recording, and all else that goes into the long process of expressing myself through music. Now I am reaching out to you in order to take it to the next level. This album is extremely important to me because it is the first real step in advancing my dream of making a career out of making music.I have already completed about 70% of the album, and have set my starting goal at only $5000 to complete recording, mastering, CD replication, artwork, and other components that are essential in completing an album. I truly believe in this album and have poured my heart and soul into it. I know that together, we will see my dream come to fruition. I am fully aware that it takes much much more than this amount to really capture everything that goes into a new album project, so I hope to reach $8000 as a stretch goal in order to truly capture my vision with the highest of quality.Thank You so much for all of the support that you, as my friends, family, and fans, have already given me. I know that with your help, paired with my hard work and dedication, we will see my dream come to life!Let's make an album!Here's What is Needed...A lot goes into making an album. I have set my starting goal at only $5,000 to cover the minimum costs of the bare essentials; things like the rest of recording, mixing and mastering, CD replication and digital distribution, artwork, perks and shipping, and IndieGoGo fees.Because so much more goes into post-production and the release of an album, I have set a stretch goal of $8000 to cover the remaining parts of album post-production; ie. marketing, press, merchandising, release concert/party, and touring.Here's What You’ll Receive…What’s better than that warm and fuzzy feeling you get when you help a young man achieve his aspirations and dreams?

My
name is Jason Gerrish.  I am a country singer/songwriter  The
honesty, integrity and values of country music have always rung true
to me since I discovered the genre. Some of the artists whose songs
have resonated the most to me are Brad Paisley, Trace Adkins, Jamey
Johnson, George Strait and Johnny Cash. I always knew that music was
what God had put in my heart to do as a passion.  I have
performed at such prestigious venues as Infinity Hall, Toad's Place
and others. </p>
<p>
Now
that the introduction is out of the way, I just finished writing
songs for my debut cd.  I can't wait to get into the studio and
record it.  The only problem is studio time, musicians,
equipment, etc... are expensive. Any funds from Indiegogo
will go towards making this the best cd that it can be.  The CD is going to be about 8 songs long.  Technically, that makes this an ep.  Every
little bit is greatly appreciated.  Even if this campaign is not
fully funded, I still intend to go forward with this project.  If
more money than needed is raised, it will go towards the purchase of
getting better equipment and/or making some great music video(s).</p>

</p><h3><b>WHO?</b></h3>
<p>Hello, I’m <b>David Knopfler</b>. 
Some of you might only know me through my work as the founder member of Dire
Straits, though <i>most</i> probably know me
through the dozen or more albums I’ve released in my own name over the past
three decades.  Some of you are already my friends, others may have met me
at my concerts, through social media, or you may simply be curious to find out
what I’ve been up to. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1438474744/l4lty6fmnlbrgned0vmv.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<h3><b>WHAT?</b></h3>
<p>I am fundraising for my next studio
album and am offering a variety of hopefully interesting and exciting ways you
can help me make this record a reality.  I’m writing to you today from my
home studio in Somerset, England.  This beautiful part of the world is one
of the places where I will be making this record. For the past several
years I’ve also spent a great deal of time in a lovely, small town in Upstate
New York called Geneseo… a well-kept, secret place that has served as an
inspiration for many of the songs I’ve written for this record, as well as a
place my family and I were honored to call home for a time.  Over these
past years I've written what I think are my best songs yet, but to get them to
you they have to be recorded in professional studios and that’s where you come
in.</p>
<h3><b>WHY ""the grace project""?</b></h3>
<p>I've titled this campaign ""the
grace project"" in part to reflect the nature of the work. Many of the
compositions, in one way or another, reflect an aspect of grace: either the
journey, the search, or grace found. Some of the songs you may have heard
in recent concerts, while others are ready to be performed and recorded for the
first time with my band. There are songs of love lost, love found, songs of loss,
of redemption and songs of hope. Above all, this is going to be a record that
I hope will resonate with you. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1439028283/lmiin6ac1pzudxdz57iz.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<p></p>
<h3><b>WHY FUNDRAISING?</b></h3>
<p>Historically, like many of my fellow
singer-songwriters (who have avoided the mainstream and who work independently
in the margins) we used to pay for our recordings through a network of
international record deals with both Indie and Major record labels.  As
most people know, with the advent of the Internet and digital media those
kinds of arrangement are as good as obsolete. </p>
<p>Too many records these days are
banged out from back bedrooms without due regard to quality. Those of you who
know my work will know only too keenly that I don’t work that way.  I like
to make personal, handmade records with great attention to both craft and art
at each and every stage of the process, from writing to recording and mastering,
to artwork and pressing.  I work with sympatico artisans, each who are masters
of their own craft and all with inordinate attention to detail… essentially,
those who have dedicated their lives to <i>music</i>
over wealth.  <br/></p>
<p>Harry Bogdanovs and I have been working on the album here in
England off and on now for some time, either polishing tracks I began in
Geneseo or originating tracks here ourselves, and I’m very excited about the
wonderful work we’ve been producing together so far, and particularly about
those songs we are planning to begin work on with other band musicians.  <br/></p>
<p>I
think it’s going to easily be my best studio album to date, but that can only
happen to the highest standards if I have sufficient funds to hire the most
appropriate players for my songs and to capture the magic and spirit of what we
are capable of creating together in a professional studio. Working with diligence, passion and patience,
it’s my sincere belief that together, with <b>YOUR</b> help, we can deliver a
combination of special tracks, each with exactly the right instrumentation and
production they need to give breadth to these songs and to give <b>YOU</b> the
best possible listening experience when you hear the results. <br/></p>
<p>I'm asking for $75,000 dollars as a reasonable budget to make the record but if we manage to exceed that amount, don't worry, we plan to use it on additional instrumentation and other trimmings. I've been known to hire whole orchestras before... Spending a recording budget is remarkably easy! <br/></p>
<h3><b>WHERE?</b></h3>
<p>I’ve been recording some of the
acoustic tracks at my home studio in England with my musical partner, <b>Harry Bogdanovs</b>, and will soon be
working at a London studio with the rest of the band, including <b>Pete Shaw</b> on bass, <b>Martin Ditcham</b> on drums and, if this campaign goes well, hopefully
other special guest musicians as well.  </p>
<h3><b>HOW?</b></h3>
<p>Every dollar counts, so whatever you
can pledge will be gratefully appreciated!  If you think this is a record
you are going to want to buy anyway, then please simply pre-order it from me
and be one of those who will get their record sooner than the official release
date.  A variety of other ways you can help are listed here, including the
opportunity to become the owner of an original and completely unique <b>Dire Straits Platinum Disc,</b> the first
ever awarded that has been in my possession since 1978.  I don’t think of
it so much as “selling my medals” as recycling them to a deserving home and as
a special thank you to someone who is going to be an important patron and
contributor to this landmark album.  <br/></p>
<p>I’ve come up with contributions in
all price ranges to suit all pockets, wallets and purses. If you can't afford
to contribute, please share the link to this fundraiser with your friends; I
appreciate all the help I can get to see this project come to fruition. 
You are the people I make music for so this is your album too.  Thank you
in advance for your help.</p>
<h3><b>WHEN?</b></h3>
<p>After the funds are raised, we will complete the album and lovingly ship out the hand packed records to you all this autumn.<br/></p>

<p><i>Metal to Boil the Blood on a Dark Winters Night</i></p>
<p><b>Xombiewoof Magazine </b>started bringing the music loving public 
reviews, interviews and stories about the musical world 7 years ago, 
then 1 year ago formed <b>Xombiewoof Records</b>, a small run boutique 
label to bring unsigned artists into the light of day, it's been great 
but now we want to do more for the world. We have done many fundraisers 
with great success to help children's charities, this year we, with the 
help of some fantastic Musical Artists, we will create the ultimate 
Heavy Metal Compilation Album!</p>
<p>With the help of Music Instrument companies, Promoters, and the bands
 themselves, as well as help from big name nationally known artists, we 
will bring out an arsenal of Heavy Metal Hits, 20 songs in total from 20
 bands on 2 Vinyl albums that will get the earth shaking, all in the 
name of helping children with life threatening illnesses. 
</p><p>Childhood Diseases can occur at any time in a child's life, and 
often, the families do not have the resources to act in time, we look to
 change that with <b>Black Winter</b>, our Fundraising Album! <br/></p><p>
</p><p>One of the many things we at
Xombiewoof Magazine do is support charities that help children; the fact is
childhood disease claims the lives of 1 out of every 100 children in America
and the rest of the world in fatality and 2 out of every hundred in crippling
or painful events that last a lifetime. Xombiewoof Magazine wants to help
change that, we want to make it our goal, with your help, to make the future a
brighter place for those that have been stricken with illness that, if detected
and treated early, don’t have to be a death or living death sentence. So often do you get messages to donate but don’t
see any reward, so we have come up with a plan to help them and make it a
benefit for you. The “Black Winter Project” is where we get donations through
the fundraiser, you get a premium for your donation and once we have produced
the album, the proceeds from the album will be given to the charities we
support. The premiums or “Perks” range from small gifts to a limited edition copy
of the finished album. We have the support of artists all over the United
States and several foreign countries that are donating a song to the album, 20
tracks for a 2 record set. You may ask why he title “Black Winter”, well
because its METAL!, Heavy Metal is a musical medium with a message of hope,
through the expression of the soul and it gets you motivated to do what you
believe in, SURVIVE the hardships and be victorious!</p>
<p>The charities we support are St. Jude’s
Hospital, The American Cancer Foundation, The Central Coast Diabetes
Foundation, The Heartbeat4Kids Program and The Fender Foundation.</p>
<b>Black Winter</b> is
planned to be the biggest collection of independent hard rock and metal artists
on one 2 record set, gathering music from the US and around the world, with
guest artists from nationally known bands lending their talents, <b>Black Winter</b> will be the one to have in
your collections. This album will be limited to 2000 copies on Black / White Marbled
Vinyl with 8 x 11 mini posters from every band involved and a Black Winter
T-Shirt.

<p>Artwork for Album Cover and T-Shirt is being created and
will be listed soon.</p><p>MID PROJECT UPDATE:</p><p>

to do something phenomenal, we plan to bring to you this December the “Black

negotiating with some top names artists to guest appear with some of the Hard

<p><b>Summary about the
Xombiewoof Record Label</b></p>
<p>Xombiewoof Records is a small independent Record Label that was
started with the intent of seeking out and recording music by new and unsigned
artists. </p>
<p>Music is a life affirming gift; it can bring you happiness
and give hope when all seems low. Music allows us to express ourselves and find
in others the words that capture our feelings. There are countless musicians
and artists in the world that for one reason or another are not able to get
their talents recorded and shared with the world. Even in this age of technology
when music is easily downloaded and ""shared"" bands that are unsigned
have limited ability and resources. </p>
<p>We want to be the game changers, the ""fairy
godfathers"" of music, we have started the development of our Recording
Studios and Mastering Facility, and we have contacted Record Pressing

Metal to Boil the Blood on a Dark Winters Night
Xombiewoof Magazine started bringing the music loving public 
reviews, interviews and stories about the musical world 7 years ago, 
then 1 year ago formed Xombiewoof Records, a small run boutique 
label to bring unsigned artists into the light of day, it's been great 
but now we want to do more for the world. We have done many fundraisers 
with great success to help children's charities, this year we, with the 
help of some fantastic Musical Artists, we will create the ultimate 
Heavy Metal Compilation Album!
With the help of Music Instrument companies, Promoters, and the bands
 themselves, as well as help from big name nationally known artists, we 
will bring out an arsenal of Heavy Metal Hits, 20 songs in total from 20
 bands on 2 Vinyl albums that will get the earth shaking, all in the 
name of helping children with life threatening illnesses. 
Childhood Diseases can occur at any time in a child's life, and 
often, the families do not have the resources to act in time, we look to
 change that with Black Winter, our Fundraising Album! 
One of the many things we at
Xombiewoof Magazine do is support charities that help children; the fact is
childhood disease claims the lives of 1 out of every 100 children in America
and the rest of the world in fatality and 2 out of every hundred in crippling
or painful events that last a lifetime. Xombiewoof Magazine wants to help
change that, we want to make it our goal, with your help, to make the future a
brighter place for those that have been stricken with illness that, if detected
and treated early, don’t have to be a death or living death sentence. So often do you get messages to donate but don’t
see any reward, so we have come up with a plan to help them and make it a
benefit for you. The “Black Winter Project” is where we get donations through
the fundraiser, you get a premium for your donation and once we have produced
the album, the proceeds from the album will be given to the charities we
support. The premiums or “Perks” range from small gifts to a limited edition copy
of the finished album. We have the support of artists all over the United
States and several foreign countries that are donating a song to the album, 20
tracks for a 2 record set. You may ask why he title “Black Winter”, well
because its METAL!, Heavy Metal is a musical medium with a message of hope,
through the expression of the soul and it gets you motivated to do what you
believe in, SURVIVE the hardships and be victorious!
The charities we support are St. Jude’s
Hospital, The American Cancer Foundation, The Central Coast Diabetes
Foundation, The Heartbeat4Kids Program and The Fender Foundation.
Black Winter is
planned to be the biggest collection of independent hard rock and metal artists
on one 2 record set, gathering music from the US and around the world, with
guest artists from nationally known bands lending their talents, Black Winter will be the one to have in
your collections. This album will be limited to 2000 copies on Black / White Marbled
Vinyl with 8 x 11 mini posters from every band involved and a Black Winter
T-Shirt.

Artwork for Album Cover and T-Shirt is being created and
will be listed soon.MID PROJECT UPDATE:

Xombiewoof Records, a small independent Record Label was
started with the intent of seeking out and recording music by new and unsigned
artists. In the 2 years since we have been developing and have started working with
the best independent bands we could find, and now, in our second year, we plan
to do something phenomenal, we plan to bring to you this December the “Black
Winter”, a 2 Record Set with 20 Metal Artists in a compilation that will be
brain smashing and organ melting and oh so cozy by the fireside.This project is in its starting stages, and we are presently
negotiating with some top names artists to guest appear with some of the Hard
Rock and Metal artists that have committed to this project. As this project
continues, we will be releasing more info, but safe to say, this will be Mega-Metal!

  

Summary about the
Xombiewoof Record Label
Xombiewoof Records is a small independent Record Label that was
started with the intent of seeking out and recording music by new and unsigned
artists. 
Music is a life affirming gift; it can bring you happiness
and give hope when all seems low. Music allows us to express ourselves and find
in others the words that capture our feelings. There are countless musicians
and artists in the world that for one reason or another are not able to get
their talents recorded and shared with the world. Even in this age of technology
when music is easily downloaded and ""shared"" bands that are unsigned
have limited ability and resources. 
We want to be the game changers, the ""fairy
godfathers"" of music, we have started the development of our Recording
Studios and Mastering Facility, and we have contacted Record Pressing
facilities in Los Angeles, New York and Indiana that will do our Vinyl
Production and Packaging.
Did you say... VINYL??
Yes, we said ""Vinyl"", there was a time when making
a record meant you made it to the top and you would create something that would
be treasured by fans all over the world, The record gave way to the CD, and
then to Digital Media, however the avid collector, hardcore fan and old school
music lovers still seek out Vinyl, the sound quality is superb and there is
nothing more fascinating than placing that big black disc on a turntable.
In recent years, Records have made a grand comeback, Record
Companies have started Producing Vinyl again, Small Record Labels are popping
up everywhere and Record Stores have become an Oasis of Musical Adventures once
more.
Unlike a traditional Record Company, we do not Contractually
sign the Artists to produce a specific amount of records, each artist will be
approached by us and offered a ""Pressing Agreement"", We will Record
and Produce a ""Limited Edition"", collectable record pressing that
will be numbered and assigned a letter of authenticity, distributed to record stores
and through direct sales through our Bandcap site - http://xombiewoofrecords.bandcamp.com,
and the band will receive, after production costs are met, an agreed portion of
sales, and a portion of our profits go to charities for the treatment of
Juvenal Diseases. Pressings will be limited to no more than 2000 copies of any
album or single, and we will also post the music for streaming at our
Soundcloud page - https://soundcloud.com/xombiewoof, where our artists' music

 would have thought that a little Black girl (oldest of 3, from a 
teenage mom) from the Westside of Chicago, would graduate college, work 
and teach dance in Europe?  That is the POWER of ONE and the impact of 
the arts.  Throughout my entire life, the Power of One was in my 
teachers and mentors.  My village built up my self esteem and life 
skills by their words, leading by example and exposing me to the 
performing arts in my childhood. Thanks to Ms. Dalber for helping me 
create and submit my first book, The Princess and The Giant, for a 
writing contest in 3rd grade. Thanks to Ms. Clarkson for taking me to 
Cats &amp; Jammin' Kids, my first dance recital in second grade.  Thanks
 to Ms. Manos for taking me to my first opera in 7th grade.  Through 
speeches, spelling bees and oratory and writing contests, I found my 
gift and sphere of influence primarily through poetry, stories and 
music.</li></ul>

euphoric feeling of knowing you're giving to something great, you're 
probably thinking, ""What's in it for me?"" As a supporter of this 
campaign you deserve perks.  Perks range from authentic gifts from 
Thailand to singing telegrams or event performances.  Perks can be seen at this page: <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/campaigns/take-the-mouthpeace-to-thailand/edit/#/?tab=perks"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Perks Link</a><br/>
</li>
</ul><p></p> <p> </p><h3>What Impact?</h3> <ul>
<li>Even with 
technology, nothing can ever replace the impact of human contact. My 
physical presence is a gateway  for youth over 8,000 miles away to 
connect with and glean from the expertise and experience through the 
lens of an African American woman. </li>
<li>Why am I so confident about this international impact? The
 MouthPeace in Thailand is an extension of what I've always done: 
empower and edutain through the arts.  From my 1 year tenure teaching 
dance to teen girls in Ireland, I know firsthand that the arts are a 
great unifier and learning tool.  Youth everywhere have something to 
say.  It's important that I give them tools to strengthen their voice. 
 I also expect to glean from their culture, so that I can use those 
tools with youth here in the U.S.
</li>
<li>THAT'S NOT ALL! Aside from 
teaching the youth, during this residency I will be completing the 
 draft of my one woman show, ""Everybody is a Star"".  I started filming 
the documentary over a year ago. This autobiographical piece will 
definitely empower and entertain people of all ages. 1 month to dedicate
 to this without competing with the rigors of daily life, will help me 
get a lot accomplished on this special project.  Some perks offer 
complimentary access to this show.</li>
</ul> <p></p> <p> </p><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<ul>
<li>The main challenges of making this campaign a reality are MONEY
 and TIME. Remember, it's 7 days to $2975. Yep, a pretty aggressive relaunch. You see, I must come up with the money within a month, as my 
flight, housing and teaching plan must be submitted for approval by 
3/1/15. </li>
<li>Another challenge is combating the 'starving artists' mentality.   
It can be difficult to procure financial support when people don't 
highly value the arts as a necessity.  </li>
<li>Aside from this campaign, I've applied for a scholarship.  I will not know if I've won this scholarship until 3/31/15.  Let's not take such a huge risk, waiting to hear about this scholarship.<br/>
</li>

<p>So, you've read it all but you can't give money.  Do you have an 
airline discount or know someone that does? Are you a business that can 
sponsor or know someone that can? That's a contribution.  Never 
underestimate the Power of One: One dollar, one call, one share, one

<p><b>WHAT IS SMA?</b></p>
<p>Semana
de Música Avanzada (SMA) –the Advanced Music Week– is an annual arts and music festival
that started 5 years ago in Guatemala City. Our main objective is to inspire
musical creativity in Guatemala through workshops, conferences, cinema,
exhibitions and shows with local, regional and international artists that are
shaping electronic and advanced music all over the world. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><br/></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><b>ARTS AND MUSIC IN GUATEMALA</b></p>
<p>Guatemala is a Central American country with a population of around
15 million people.  An approximate 40% live in extreme poverty and another 30% live
on minimum wage.  The amount of people that have actual access to
 cultural activities and electronic music events in the country is
extremely small. </p>
<p>For the past 10 years Guatemala has seen an innovative cultural
movement emerging with new galleries, art spaces, clubs, independent music
labels and independent editorial houses.  One of the breaking points has
been the reappearance of the old city center as an area for creativity and low
cost housing, which has seen many local artists hub there.  Another game changer
has been the growth of electronic music in Guatemala. Underground parties
sparked a new vision for many young musicians over the past years. These events
have brought a sense of equality on the dancefloor, with people from different
ages, races, social status and sexual orientation dancing side by side. This is
an exciting development, particularly in the Guatemalan context.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><br/></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><b>BRIEF HISTORY OF SMA</b></p>
<p>SMA started in 2011 under the direction of Andrés Castaño, a local Dj,
producer and promoter who has been involved in electronic music in the country
for more than 15 years.  The original idea was to create an event that would
bring together diverse cultures, sounds, and socioeconomic groups in an attempt
to break the social barriers that have torn the region.  This edition
started as a two day event where many local artists, along with Luis Maier (Sunjam)
from Honduras and Xpansul (True Type Tracks, Plus 8) from Spain.  The
festival hosted 3 conferences, a movie screening and a flyer and photography
exhibition documenting the origins of the electronic music scene in
Guatemala.  The events were hosted in 3 different spots in the city
center.*</p>
<p>*See below for description and documentation of each SMA edition
during the past 5 years.  </p>

</p>
<p><b>WHY WE ASK YOU TO DONATE</b></p>
<p>As a nonprofit organization, our objective is to continue offering
accessible entry to all events while remaining a sustainable project. We
receive aid from CCE (Spanish Cultural Center), German Embassy, Fundación Paulo
Alvarado, and from the Guatemalan Ministry of Culture. Despite rapidly growing
interest -evident in festival attendance, financial support from cultural
organizations, and an exciting guest roster- we still rely mainly on private
investment from the director and his team.</p>
<p>Many of the local and regional artists hdonate their work
understanding the importance of SMA.  However, we aim to compensate all
artists, speakers, and workers who make this event possible. Neither the
directory nor the team working for SMA receive any payment for their labor.</p>
<p>A pivotal element in SMA is to make most of the events as affordable
for all people in the country regardless of their economical status. The
opening night is 100% donation based. On subsequent days, most of the
workshops, cinema and conferences cost around $2.00 and the parties cost no
more than $16.00. There is also a festival bracelet which covers all of
the activities for $25.00. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>WHAT COMES NEXT?</b></p>
<p>The festival´s sixth edition is aimed
to be a game changer.  We want to improve all of the activities, have more
focused hands on workshops and do new installations and activities in the
streets of the city center.  Along with this we want to be able to bring
back some of the artists that have shaped this past editions (including
Cristopher Willits, Tom Ellis, and Xpansul) and also be able to bring new
artists such as Tycho, Dauwd, ATOM TM, Dave Aju, Juan Atkins, among others.
However, this will only be possible if we can gather 50% of the festival´s
total costs through this campaign and through new like-minded sponsors. </p>
<p>We know not everyone can make an economic donation. In that case, please
share this through social media or word of mouth with any person you know or
feel might be interested in contributing. </p>
<p>Muchas gracias,</p>
<p>Andrés Castaño</p>

<p><b>Second edition of SMA (2012)</b></p>

The second edition saw new acts from El Salvador, Mexico, Spain and
Honduras.  The festival started growing and also officially initiated the
relationship with the Spanish Cultural Center which has been a key ally so
far.  This edition also marked the incorporation of 2 very special music
figures in the country, Paulo Alvarado and Joaquin Orellana, two of the
greatest experimental classical artists of our times in Guatemala. <br/><p></p>

Guatemala.  The events were hosted in 3 different spots in the city
center.*

WHY WE ASK YOU TO DONATE
As a nonprofit organization, our objective is to continue offering
accessible entry to all events while remaining a sustainable project. We
receive aid from CCE (Spanish Cultural Center), German Embassy, Fundación Paulo
Alvarado, and from the Guatemalan Ministry of Culture. Despite rapidly growing
interest -evident in festival attendance, financial support from cultural
organizations, and an exciting guest roster- we still rely mainly on private
investment from the director and his team.
Many of the local and regional artists hdonate their work
understanding the importance of SMA.  However, we aim to compensate all
artists, speakers, and workers who make this event possible. Neither the
directory nor the team working for SMA receive any payment for their labor.
A pivotal element in SMA is to make most of the events as affordable
for all people in the country regardless of their economical status. The
opening night is 100% donation based. On subsequent days, most of the
workshops, cinema and conferences cost around $2.00 and the parties cost no
more than $16.00. There is also a festival bracelet which covers all of
the activities for $25.00. 

WHAT COMES NEXT?
The festival´s sixth edition is aimed
to be a game changer.  We want to improve all of the activities, have more
focused hands on workshops and do new installations and activities in the
streets of the city center.  Along with this we want to be able to bring
back some of the artists that have shaped this past editions (including
Cristopher Willits, Tom Ellis, and Xpansul) and also be able to bring new
artists such as Tycho, Dauwd, ATOM TM, Dave Aju, Juan Atkins, among others.
However, this will only be possible if we can gather 50% of the festival´s
total costs through this campaign and through new like-minded sponsors. 
We know not everyone can make an economic donation. In that case, please
share this through social media or word of mouth with any person you know or
feel might be interested in contributing. 
Muchas gracias,
Andrés Castaño

*PREVIOUS EDITIONS OF SMA: 
Second edition of SMA (2012)

The second edition saw new acts from El Salvador, Mexico, Spain and
Honduras.  The festival started growing and also officially initiated the
relationship with the Spanish Cultural Center which has been a key ally so
far.  This edition also marked the incorporation of 2 very special music
figures in the country, Paulo Alvarado and Joaquin Orellana, two of the
greatest experimental classical artists of our times in Guatemala. 



Joaquín Orellana

Paulo Alvarado




Third and fourth editions of SMA (2013,
2014)
The third and fourth edition added 2 more days of activities and
promoted new genres, as well as new activities such as cinema.  The
exhibitions took a new lifeform exploring visual artists paired with local
musicians such as Paulo Alvarado and Alex Hentze who cured a space for
contemplation with quadraphonic sound along video mapping with Mario
Santos.  This editions hosted artists such as Tom Ellis(UK), Robert
Babicz(Bedrock, GER), Andy Martin(Items & Things, MEX) and Wooky and
Videocratz(Lapsus, ESP) among others. 




SMA 4th Edition Opening Day

Alex Hentze + Mario Santos Quadraphonic Mapping

Regina Celli concert Opening Night




Fifth edition of SMA (2015)
The fifth edition came strong with new international talent.
Cristopher Willits(Ghostly International, USA) performed live for the
festival´s opening night and German duo COMA along with Robag Whrüme hosted a
special Kompakt Showcase.  The festival closed with regional talent,
K.E.E.N.E. from Panama, Esteban Howell from Costa Rica and local ghetto house
master Sishi Rosch played sets along Gabriel Cazali, Alex Hentze, Chiru, Lujo
Prado and Voodoo Disco.  This edition also solidified the work team behind
SMA which finally has all of the pieces of the puzzle together.

<p>Lastly, I think this approach is pretty hilarious, hopefully you did too! Always trying to share smiles and have a good time. No intention of offending, but I know my humor isn't everyone's cup of tea. Like I said, laugh with me or at me, or diagonally across from me, I don't care what orientation you prefer, just as long as you 'Smile'- my favorite Michael Jackson song, the Original Longhair King and my first love. I dedicate my work to him, he started it all and has inspired everything I do. I love you Michael. </p>

RISKS AND CHALLENGES:
Well, there's always the chance things don't go according to plan. 
Risks: Asteroids, being eaten by Sasquatch, poisoned broccoli, a voodoo hex. File those under non-imminent. 
Challenges: Preventing my assistant from dry-humping the model's leg. Getting enough protein for breakfast. Getting enough sleep while couchsurfing. 
With 7 years experience as a photographer I know I can handle the usual stresses that come with the job.  Short of losing limbs, or exploding in a crash, I'm gonna get the job done. 
 Other Ways You Can Help
 Help by spreading the word to any and all Longhair Lovers you know or to short-haired and generous men you may know, especially if they have a power exchange kink where they enjoy paving the way for another's dream even if (or especially if) it has nothing to do with them. Trust me, it's out there, fucking google it. Thanks 50 Shades. ;) 
Please remember to use the Indiegogo share tools when spreading this campaign like herpes on a college campus!…Or nutella on toast…ok, let's go with the latter. I don't wanna get sued. 
If you're a journalist or know one, feel free to feature my project to meet your last-minute 'WTF?' story deadline! Whether people laugh WITH me or AT me is none of my business, it's a funny story either way. Viral potential right here!
Lastly, I think this approach is pretty hilarious, hopefully you did too! Always trying to share smiles and have a good time. No intention of offending, but I know my humor isn't everyone's cup of tea. Like I said, laugh with me or at me, or diagonally across from me, I don't care what orientation you prefer, just as long as you 'Smile'- my favorite Michael Jackson song, the Original Longhair King and my first love. I dedicate my work to him, he started it all and has inspired everything I do. I love you Michael. 
Long live the Longhairs!

Summary</b></p>
<p>Broken Arts is a volunteer-run
collective dedicated to fostering local and independent creativity in Oshawa,
Ontario. We've been around for six years and this year will mark our fifth
annual installment of Broken Arts Fest on July 18th, 2015.</p>
<p>Broken Arts Fest is a free music
festival in Oshawa's Memorial Park featuring mostly local musicians, as well as
vendors selling their homemade wares. Because Broken Arts isn't a
profit-seeking organization, we rely on donations, sponsorship and vendor fees
to make the festival happen. The more funding we get, the better the festival!
That's where you come in.</p>
<p><b>What
We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>We - the Broken Arts team - have been
working very hard this year to get the festival running, and we've come a long
way. There are still certain expenses, however - such as renting sound
equipment and paying the performers - that can stand to benefit greatly from
additional funding.</p>
<p>Depending on how close to the festival
you choose to donate, we may not receive your actual donation in time for the event.
But knowing that your donation is on its way will let us know that we can cover
the expenses knowing that we will be able to recoup what we spend.</p>
<p>We have set the goal of $500 as a
best-case scenario. If we do not reach the desired goal, the money we do raise
will still greatly help us in the execution of Broken Arts Fest.</p>
<p><b>The
Impact</b></p>
<p>The Broken Arts team
does this job as a labour of love -- none of us make a profit from it and we
take time out of our personal lives to put everything together. Why do we do
it? Each member of the team will likely give you a different answer, but what
unites us is the conviction that community action at a local level matters. We
want to give a platform to people making independent art, no matter their age
or socio-economic status.</p>
<p><b>Risks
&amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p></p><p>While we expect to raise enough money
to allow the festival to go on without a hitch, we are not quite there yet.
Some members of our team have occupied leadership roles in other organizations
and have run large events before, so we are confident in our abilities to
surmount every challenge in our way. Your contribution, however, will go very
far in aiding us. </p><a rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>
<p><b>Other Ways You Can Help</b></p>
<p>If you can't contribute monetarily,
you can still help out! Head over to our Facebook page or our Twitter (@brokenartsca),

happening! If you live in Durham Region and want to volunteer on the day, you

<p><strong>“Roff’s voice demonstrates remarkable

<p>With over fifteen years of musical experience,
Connor Roff’s passion for music has taken him around the world. After leaving

to and inspired by the likes of the Rolling Stones, Ray Charles and Fleetwood
Mac, with his range of tastes enhancing his performance versatility.</p>
<p>Classically trained on the piano and self-taught
on the guitar, this repertoire helped Roff develop a unique style, fusing rock,
pop, folk and soul, with a powerful voice.</p>

<p>Roff took to the stage for the Celebrate!
Stanley Park 125th Anniversary alongside The Arkells, The Matinée, and others

organizing two solo Eastern Canada tours and performing on the train as part of
VIA Rail’s Artist on Board program.<br/>

Roff’s move to London, England has given him exposure to a scene that has

This next phase will help us launch the first printing of a full-sized, 60-page book to showcase the stunning music of an ""otherwise forgotten"" composer. In the book, we will explore the ups and downs of Robert Franz's life, along with interesting tidbits about his relationships with some of the famous composers of his day [Wagner, Schumann, Liszt, Mendelssohn], and a deeper look into the lives of the poets who inspired him. The poems, newly translated into 21st century English, thanks to Dr. Wendell Frye, will appear in large and easy-to-read fonts throughout the book. More on Dr. Frye's expertise can be found here:http://www.amazon.com/Indian-Summer-Translated-Wendell-Printing/dp/3034303483/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1426542725&sr=8-2&keywords=wendell+frye***********************************************************If it had not been for Rita Greenstein, this project would never have happened. If you have a few moments to watch this youtube, you will find out why Rita continues to be an ongoing inspiration, not only to us, but many many others:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wuJalMCBlg ******************************************************************Funding will also pay for the excellent [and long, meticulous and painstaking] work of Alex Guerrero, one of NYC's top lyric tenors, who created clean, newly typeset sheet music for a significant number of Franz's songs, many of which have never been published in the USA:http://www.bach-cantatas.com/Bio/Guerrero-Alex.htm",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p><b>What We Need
&amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>We’re raising
money to cover the costs of an ensemble of 10 artists who will be traveling
with us from Italy to Berlin to Munich. Funding raised will cover transport
costs, housing and production expenses.</p>
<p>We have a bunch
of great perks, including the ultimate opportunity to share in the creative
process and stay with us in residency at the <b><a href=""http://www.hellergarden.com/en/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.hellergarden.com/en/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Heller Garden Villa</a></b> in the Italian
Rivera.</p>
<p>Please help
support us and be a part of the creation and realization of this work.</p>
<p><b>Why we need to
do this</b></p>
<p>In our work we
constantly strive to explore stories that challenge and expand our personal
understanding of humanity as a whole. We are using Rilke’s words as a window to
see deeper into ourselves and our relationships. This piece speaks to the
primal human experiences of fear, anxiety, and isolation and explores the
greater potentiality of Love, Intimacy and Creative Inspiration. These themes
that are so viscerally relatable are not bound by gender, culture, tradition or
language. They are universal and by bringing together this diverse group of
Artists we are able to give voice to a spectrum of perspectives.</p>
<p>We live in an
era of isolation but without solitude. We are constantly surrounded by people
and devices and yet we remain strangers to ourselves. How then can we know
intimacy? If we were to embrace our solitude could we know each other on a
deeper level?  </p>
<p>We have been
developing work between the United States and Europe since 2010. Our first
piece, ""La Cueca"" premiered at the Solar Gallery and New York Chelsea
Art Museum to critical acclaim. We spent time in Berlin developing our second
piece ""Sometimes at Night"" touted by ArtiBerlin as “A true discovery
in the Berlin art scene.” We debuted ""116"" at the New Ohio Theatre in
New York in the fall and recently premiered ""Wild Horses"", an
anti-musical with original music by recognized Spanish composer, Dani Campos.
This will be our fifth original work and our return to Europe with an
incredible ensemble of box collective artists, who we have been working with
over the past five years.</p>
<p><b>Risks &amp;
Challenges</b></p>
<p>This is most
ambitious piece we’ve ever undertaken. We have artists coming together from the
US, Belgium, Austria, Australia, Spain and Germany to create and perform this
work.</p>
<p>It’s our first
time traveling with a small child, baby Darth Vader, who has many special needs,
but is very supportive in the building of an Empire.</p>
<p>In all
seriousness, he’s super high-maintenance, but really this is the next step in
the evolution of the box collective working towards our vision of an
international ensemble that truly crosses borders both geographically and
artistically.</p>
<p><b>Other Ways You
Can Help</b></p>
<p>We are so
grateful for whatever you can contribute to help us realize this ambitious
goal, even it if means just sharing our work with your friends and community.
Help us to continue charting into the unknown.</p>

box collective &amp; baby Darth Vader</p>

What We Need
& What You Get
We’re raising
money to cover the costs of an ensemble of 10 artists who will be traveling
with us from Italy to Berlin to Munich. Funding raised will cover transport
costs, housing and production expenses.
We have a bunch
of great perks, including the ultimate opportunity to share in the creative
process and stay with us in residency at the Heller Garden Villa in the Italian
Rivera.
Please help
support us and be a part of the creation and realization of this work.
Why we need to
do this
In our work we
constantly strive to explore stories that challenge and expand our personal
understanding of humanity as a whole. We are using Rilke’s words as a window to
see deeper into ourselves and our relationships. This piece speaks to the
primal human experiences of fear, anxiety, and isolation and explores the
greater potentiality of Love, Intimacy and Creative Inspiration. These themes
that are so viscerally relatable are not bound by gender, culture, tradition or
language. They are universal and by bringing together this diverse group of
Artists we are able to give voice to a spectrum of perspectives.
We live in an
era of isolation but without solitude. We are constantly surrounded by people
and devices and yet we remain strangers to ourselves. How then can we know
intimacy? If we were to embrace our solitude could we know each other on a
deeper level?  
We have been
developing work between the United States and Europe since 2010. Our first
piece, ""La Cueca"" premiered at the Solar Gallery and New York Chelsea
Art Museum to critical acclaim. We spent time in Berlin developing our second
piece ""Sometimes at Night"" touted by ArtiBerlin as “A true discovery
in the Berlin art scene.” We debuted ""116"" at the New Ohio Theatre in
New York in the fall and recently premiered ""Wild Horses"", an
anti-musical with original music by recognized Spanish composer, Dani Campos.
This will be our fifth original work and our return to Europe with an
incredible ensemble of box collective artists, who we have been working with
over the past five years.
Risks &
Challenges
This is most
ambitious piece we’ve ever undertaken. We have artists coming together from the
US, Belgium, Austria, Australia, Spain and Germany to create and perform this
work.
It’s our first
time traveling with a small child, baby Darth Vader, who has many special needs,
but is very supportive in the building of an Empire.
In all
seriousness, he’s super high-maintenance, but really this is the next step in
the evolution of the box collective working towards our vision of an
international ensemble that truly crosses borders both geographically and
artistically.
Other Ways You
Can Help
We are so
grateful for whatever you can contribute to help us realize this ambitious
goal, even it if means just sharing our work with your friends and community.
Help us to continue charting into the unknown.
Love from the
box collective & baby Darth Vader",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

inanmış; onun toplumları birleştiren, kültürleri birbirine kaynaştıran bir
ortak dünya dili olduğunu savunan bir grup gönüllü olarak 2004 yılında yalın,
basit bir piyano festivali ile yola çıktık. Gümüşlük’ü mekan tuttuk,
festivalimiz ilk yılından itibaren çok sevildi. Daha ikinci yılında
uluslararası bir klasik müzik festivaline dönüştük. Üçüncü yılımızda yaz müzik
okulumuzla, festival akademimizi hayata geçirdik. Bu yaz 12. yılımızda dünyanın
en önde gelen sanatçı, quartet ve orkestralarını ağırlamaya hazırlanıyoruz.
Gümüşlük Festival Akademisinde 4 ayrı disiplinde masterclasslar düzenleyeceğiz
ve öğrencilerimize sertifika vereceğiz. Ayrıca Ahmed Adnan Saygun Piyano
Yarışmamızın da üçüncüsünü düzenleyeceğiz.<br/>
<br/><b>
Bütçemize destek verin!</b><br/>
Tüm bunları yapmak sadece fiziksel güç, inat ve imanla olmuyor. Festivalimizin
bu yıl ihtiyaç duyduğu bütçe 580.000 TL’dir. Bütçedeki başlıca kalemler
şunlardır; Sanatçı kaşeleri, sanatçı transfer ve konaklama giderleri, mekan
kiraları, festival ekip ve personel giderleri,  tanıtım ve promosyon
giderleri, teknik (ses, ışık) giderler ve daha birçok kalem… Lütfen IndieGoGo
paylaşım araçlarını kullanarak kampanyamızın duyulmasında bize yardımcı olun</p>
<p><b>Destek kategorileri</b><br/>
Kampanyamızda iki ayrı kategoride destekçi belirlemek durumunda kaldık.
Bunlardan ilki festivale coğrafi açıdan uzak olan ancak yaptıklarımızı takdir
eden kişilerin bize sunacakları maddi destekler. Diğeri ise festivale yıllardır
katılan ve festivali zaten önceden de desteklemiş ya da gelecek dönemlerde
desteklemek isteyen müzikseverler. Biz kendilerine önceden de “Festival
Dostları” diyor ve yaptıkları maddi destekler ölçüsünde sınıflandırıp, o ölçüde
hediye ve avantajlarla teşekkürlerimizi sunuyorduk.<br/>
- Sayfanın sağındaki <b>""DESTEKÇİ""</b> başlıklı kutucuklarda; festivale
katılamayacak klasik müzikseverler için 10$, 50$,100$ ve 200$’lık seçenekler ve
avantajlar sunduk.<br/>
- Ve yine sayfanın sağında <b>""FESTİVAL DOSTU""</b> başlıklı kutucuklarda;
bizi takip eden ya da takip edecek festival dostları için farklı maddi destek
seçenekleri ve avantajlar sunduk.<br/>
<br/><b>

In our second year, we became the Gumusluk International Classical Music Festival. By year three, we had added a summer school to the program of events. This summer, the festival program includes an outstanding program of the worlds greatest artists, quartets and orchestras. The Gumusluk Festival Academy, which has attendance of over 600 students since 2006 turns 10 this year. This year, the GFA will open masterclasses in flute, piano, voice and violin.  Young students from all over the world are also invited this year to participate in the 3rd Ahmed Adnan Saygun Piano competition.<b> </b></p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>Help us finance the festival !</b></p><p>It takes a whole lot of hard work, conviction and determination to keep the festival going each year. However, this is not enough!  The festival needs a budget of 580.000 TL this year to cover all expenses.

inanmış; onun toplumları birleştiren, kültürleri birbirine kaynaştıran bir
ortak dünya dili olduğunu savunan bir grup gönüllü olarak 2004 yılında yalın,
basit bir piyano festivali ile yola çıktık. Gümüşlük’ü mekan tuttuk,
festivalimiz ilk yılından itibaren çok sevildi. Daha ikinci yılında
uluslararası bir klasik müzik festivaline dönüştük. Üçüncü yılımızda yaz müzik
okulumuzla, festival akademimizi hayata geçirdik. Bu yaz 12. yılımızda dünyanın
en önde gelen sanatçı, quartet ve orkestralarını ağırlamaya hazırlanıyoruz.
Gümüşlük Festival Akademisinde 4 ayrı disiplinde masterclasslar düzenleyeceğiz
ve öğrencilerimize sertifika vereceğiz. Ayrıca Ahmed Adnan Saygun Piyano
Yarışmamızın da üçüncüsünü düzenleyeceğiz.

Bütçemize destek verin!
Tüm bunları yapmak sadece fiziksel güç, inat ve imanla olmuyor. Festivalimizin
bu yıl ihtiyaç duyduğu bütçe 580.000 TL’dir. Bütçedeki başlıca kalemler
şunlardır; Sanatçı kaşeleri, sanatçı transfer ve konaklama giderleri, mekan
kiraları, festival ekip ve personel giderleri,  tanıtım ve promosyon
giderleri, teknik (ses, ışık) giderler ve daha birçok kalem… Lütfen IndieGoGo
paylaşım araçlarını kullanarak kampanyamızın duyulmasında bize yardımcı olun
Destek kategorileri
Kampanyamızda iki ayrı kategoride destekçi belirlemek durumunda kaldık.
Bunlardan ilki festivale coğrafi açıdan uzak olan ancak yaptıklarımızı takdir
eden kişilerin bize sunacakları maddi destekler. Diğeri ise festivale yıllardır
katılan ve festivali zaten önceden de desteklemiş ya da gelecek dönemlerde
desteklemek isteyen müzikseverler. Biz kendilerine önceden de “Festival
Dostları” diyor ve yaptıkları maddi destekler ölçüsünde sınıflandırıp, o ölçüde
hediye ve avantajlarla teşekkürlerimizi sunuyorduk.

It was long
before I ever saw a smartphone, a stream was a place to catch frogs, and my father had told me to never
touch a screen... Ever!
I was a fourteen year old kid. I convinced my loving mother that I was man enough to go to the event by
myself. She convinced me that I was man enough to pay for it. So, a few days later, I found myself at the
box office counting dollars, silver coins, and then pennies to pay for the very last ticket. I actually ended
up borrowing 8 cents from the cashier, but I was happy I made it. I love great live music.
Years later, I was a mild­mannered music manager/producer by day, custom computer­building /repair
business owner at night (and day). I loved the music. I loved building custom computers for home, music
studios, and other businesses. Unfortunately, both the music industry and the desktop computer industry
were being squeezed to near death by the exploding mobile device industry and the glut of free music
downloads. The tide was coming. Lots of people were being drowned. I decided to build a boat. I knew
there must be ways to innovate so that tide of mobile technology could be used to take music higher rather
than take it under.
I brainstormed nightly. On one of those nights, I was pacing through my pitch dark living room when
that experience from decades before popped into my head. It was live music transformed into an
interactive experience that engaged and enthralled the audience like nothing I have ever seen. That
experience was a Bobby Mcferrin one man live performance..... More like a two thousand and one man
performance because Bobby put us all in the show. We were singing background parts with him on stage,
harmonizing in our seats, even deciding which songs he performed. We all felt like stars.
I paced the floor of that living room for several months more. I dreamed up the the ultimate interactive
live music experience. I spent countless hours imagining features. I went to shows and imagined how
amazing they could be. I added, subtracted, and refined features and processes until I had the most
amazing product I could imagine and made it as simple as possible. It took a couple years for technology
to catch up. In that time, I had built a team of rockstars who are passionate about this idea and they made

Thank you so much for checking out my fundraiser!
Music is a powerful and sacred tool to create change, peace and healing in this world and in ourselves. I know that we can alter our surroundings with the gravity of our collective, benevolent intentions~ which is why I create the music I do.
The purpose of this fundraiser is threefold: 
First: I am raising money to complete and print my third, full-length CD,  ""Pool of Love.""  I hope these songs nourish you as much as they've nourished me! 10 new originals... (Hear part of two new songs in the video, at the beginning and end).
Second: To reprint my first CD, ""Roses,""  which has sold its first 1000 physical copies, worldwide. You can hear songs from this CD at: http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/AlexaSunshineRose
And Third: To purchase the minimal, high-quality recording equipment I need to be able to record my own music anywhere and eventually, to offer my sound engineering and production services to other sound artists.

I am really hoping to finish and print this CD by this summer. That said, life amongst the swirl of raising three young children often takes unexpected twists and turns. So... When I meet my funding goal, my commitment to you is this:
I will complete this CD and publish it, reprint Roses and obtain recording equipment by 12/2015. 
Any funds I make above and beyond my goal amount will be used to empower these musical endeavors happening in a beautiful, timely way. (Above and beyond, my next goal is to create a CD of conscious children's music.) 
If I don't meet my funding goal, I will prioritize my new CD, then reprinting Roses, then getting the gear. 

Gracias!!


THANK YOU  so much for using your energy and currency to empower my offering to the world. 
Your support means so much to me. May all that you give return to you 1000-fold! <3
Amen!

<h3>A Short Summary</h3> <p>Hi, my name is Takako! I am a Japanese pianist currently working towards a doctoral degree in piano performance at University of Miami's Frost School of Music. This summer is my very last chance to be a student and participate in music festivals and competitions before launching myself into the cutthroat job market. </p>
<p>I have been recommended and accepted to attend PIANALE, an international piano competition and institution where I will be given performance opportunities and have masterclasses/lessons with an international roster of acclaimed professors. In addition to the competition, I want to take this opportunity to broaden my network by meeting and playing for the diverse population of musicians at the festival in preparation for my life after school. <br/></p>
<p>If I win the top prize, which is what I am practicing tirelessly for, I could be offered <i>additional concert engagements in Germany, Spain, and the UK - including an appearance as a soloist with a symphony</i>. <br/></p>
<p>I was also accepted to play for the renowned Japanese pianist, educator, and juror, Akiko Ebi. She is held in very high regard throughout the international musical community and it would be truly valuable for my career advancement if she recognizes my talent.<br/></p>
<p><b>The Challenge</b><br/></p>
<p>Everything sounds wonderful except for the one thing that is holding me back from my dream to play in Europe, which is why I am calling for help through this funding page. I unfortunately cannot empty my available funds to travel and study in Germany, nor can I ask my mother for assistance as she has been surviving minimally on her own after my father passed away. <br/></p>
<p>To make this project a reality, I need assistance in covering these main fees:<br/></p>
<ul>
<li><i><b>Airfare - $1300</b></i></li>
<li><i><b>Tuition &amp; Room and Board - $2000</b></i></li>
</ul>
<p>Every penny would help me approach my life goals and I truly appreciate your time for reading this page. I want to sincerely thank you for being a part of my endeavor! I would also be grateful if you could share this funding campaign with anyone who may be willing to contribute.<br/></p>

<li>If I don't meet that goal, I'll get 500 eco wallet CDs for $599, plus $68 shipping = $667 total. Or less--I'll do as much as I can with what I'm given. :)</li>
<li>Selling these at shows helps me re-coup expenses and record more sick tunes. I use Bison Disc because they make great CDs, are affordable and are a woman-owned, small business in the South. </li>

I've been a finalist in the Comedy category of the International Songwriting Competition for the past two years.  I think these songs are the funniest yet and can't wait to share them with you.
I host the Homoground Queer & Allied Open Mic along with Laila Nur, where we provide a platform for other marginalized artistic folks in the South. I've self-funded all of my musical projects to this point (4 albums and 3 videos total), but recently left my day job to perform full-time.  I'm asking your help to print 1000 copies of Vageezus: Voice of A Gynaration, with a stretch goal of helping offset the costs of making a music video for one of the tracks, ""Sweatsuit Swag.""

You can hear some of the tracks here:
""Baby Got Bush""https://purdyholsom.bandcamp.com/track/baby-got-bush

""Sweatsuit Swag""https://purdyholsom.bandcamp.com/track/sweatsuit-swag

""It All Went Wrong (When I Pooped My Thong)""https://purdyholsom.bandcamp.com/track/it-all-went-wrong-when-i-pooped-my-thong

""Gay Money""http://purdyholsom.bandcamp.com/track/gay-money
   What I Need & What You Get  I want to print 1000 eco wallet CD copies of Vageezus: Voice of A Gynaration  through Bison Disc for $899, plus $104 shipping = $1003 total. 
If I don't meet that goal, I'll get 500 eco wallet CDs for $599, plus $68 shipping = $667 total. Or less--I'll do as much as I can with what I'm given. :)
Selling these at shows helps me re-coup expenses and record more sick tunes. I use Bison Disc because they make great CDs, are affordable and are a woman-owned, small business in the South.

Any help is greatly appreciated.
Plus, if we get known better in the process, that also means we have better chances of playing in your area! A simple share supports us. 




Promised land tells the story of a conqueror and his warriors who came from the North to leave a glorious legacy for his people and the memory that his name deserves. 
He will discover his promised land, but will also meet Odin's divine wrath.


Where the money goes:
Here's how the costs all break down:

Recording, mixing, and mastering

The rest goes towards new quality t-shirts, stickers, etc

<h3>Friends and Pals:</h3>
<p>The goal/dream has always been to press a vinyl record and there's no time like the present.  After a pretty tough spell, I decided to get back into things and I wrote and recorded this album.  Since the album is already recorded, this campaign is aimed specifically at funding the mastering and pressing processes.  All donations will have the option of being refunded at a later date (up until the goal is met), as the point of this isn't to take your money, but to simply get the funding necessary to complete the record. I appreciate your considerations!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Read on if you're bored:<br/></p>
<p>I've played in punk and rock bands since age 14 (somewhere around there) with varying degrees of success.  If you're viewing this, most likely you're familiar with some, or possibly all of those exploits.  If not, I'm sorry and they're not worth getting into, but I'll link some older tunes for reference. I've always been proud of my collaborations with others (although critical of my own contributions to those collaborations) and that stays true with this release.  <br/></p>
<p>This album was recorded without much flow, as it was done around two very, very busy schedules, but the spirit of the record rings clear, I think and Jon (Gunnell) made it sound a lot better than it otherwise would have.  I really hope it provides some insight to myself and that possibly some folks can relate to it and, more importantly....just get it, as that was really almost the point of writing it.  <br/></p>
<p>Hope to see you all around city in the meantime, as we start debuting these songs live!<br/></p>

</div>
<div>Welcome Everyone and Thank You so much for visiting my Indiegogo! </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>For over a year I have been writing, recording and self-producing tracks in my home studio for my 2nd full-length music project, ©<b><i>Wood and Snake</i></b>. I am really excited about what is happening in this wave of music coming through, and all of the people who are already helping make it shine!  </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<p><b>©<i>Wood and Snake</i></b> is a beat-driven groovy, rhythmic, eclectic dance-able compilation of original music and one traditional Sephardic song from Spain, with lyrics in English, Arabic, and Medieval Spanish.  I have fantastic musicians contributing their brilliance to each track, including the talented Daniel Mogtaderi on violin, Eric Ederer on Yayli Tanbur and Oud, Nicholas Ragheb on percussion, Bryan Snyder on flutes, Benjamin Cziller on Bass, Maz Karandish on Oud, Youssef Bouallag on Arabic translation and vocals, and Fred Nadis on clarinet.  Me on hammered dulcimer, vocals, percussion, and sound design.  My intention is to bring a couple of other musicians into the mix as well.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div>
<div>My last co-produced project, Mystery of Souls (© 2007), with Marshall Lefferts, was a blast to make and I have heard so many wonderful stories of people's experiences with the music. We affectionately called it ""otherworld music"" because of the ethereal aspect of the intuitive language lyrics  (If you don't know what intuitive language means, think Dead Can Dance. Lisa Gerrard did this when she sang on most of their albums). I had a vision from way back to vocalize that way. I loved hearing how it inspired and touched people. And this is why music is important for me personally. And the blessing of recording and collaborating with other musicians  totally turns me on!  </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b>What is Wood and Snake?</b></div>
<div>Wood and Snake is a metaphor of the things we experience and how we interpret them, the past we bring into the present that robs us of seeing things as they are.  It is the perception we hold about life, and the illusions that hold us back. The title track, <b><i>Wood and Snake</i></b>, plays with these ideas and hopefully gets you dancing and contemplating! Wow, that's cool!</div>
<div>I have been writing, producing and recording, working on all the elements of releasing this CD in the Fall, and now I need your help!  I am really happy with what I've done so far...some of the music is included in the video above so you can hear the vibe.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<h3>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">What is Needed to Release this CD?</span><br/>
</h3>
</div><div>What I need, really need, to get this music out there, is this:</div><div> <ul> <li>Pro studio time for some tracks, TBD/$1000-1500</li>
<li>Mixing and Mastering, $3,000+ -- I am very excited to have engineers on board and ready to start, to take this music to the stratosphere, and they are worth it! More to come on these experienced artists.</li>
<li>Paying the fine musicians who make this music shine, $1,000+</li>
<li>CD Duplication and Marketing materials, $1,500+</li> <li>Website, Photography, Cover Art and Social Media Design, $1500</li> <li>CD Release Concert, TBD</li> </ul>
<div>These are very basic expenses that will allow me to release the music to the public. My priority in asking for help is bringing the production to completion for the Fall Release, and these elements are key to that happening. Your support is  important and graciously appreciated, and I thank you from the bottom of my heart in advance for any contribution you can make. </div>
<div>In addition to this campaign, there are other costs that will arise in making music videos, editing, live concert fees, merchandising, additional music production, etc.  So I humbly and gratefully accept all contributions above and beyond the Goal!  <b>All contributions </b>go toward making music, and anything above the goal will cover taking tracks to a deeper level of production with the expertise of others. I want these tracks to shine brightly, and be the best they can be for your ecstatic enjoyment!</div>
<div><br/></div> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>
<p>I really hope that one of the ways this music will inspire you is to carry a message that we are here to create in life that which moves us and brings us joy, and at any time, at any age, at any stage of our life, we have the right to create from our heart and soul, the way that is most meaningful for us. This is how I created this music, and I believe in a world where we are all encouraged and empowered to engage in our creativity, whatever that is. So take a step for your art, and let us know when you do! </p>
<p>Giving back and helping others through this project is important to me. Right now, there are millions of women and children in Syria who are homeless and without food or shelter.  They need help desperately. So <b>a portion of all sales will go directly to NuDay Syria (<a href=""http://www.NuDaySyria.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.NuDaySyria.net</a>) to help these people with basic needs and to rebuild their lives. </b>The sooner the album starts selling, the sooner these contributions will go to help those in acute situations. Meanwhile, feel free to visit the organization and donate right away!</p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Crowd-funding is an excellent platform that asks us to step up and take a stand for what we are creating, ask for help, enlist the community, and make things happen that might not otherwise happen, without going into tremendous debt to do so. Let's all support each other to live our dreams!</span></p>

</div><div> <p>My intention is to release this album in early Fall.  With your support, this will happen. Without it, I am still committed to releasing this music, but it will take longer.  </p>

<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>And hey! If you can't make a contribution today, please know that your help can come in other forms. You can share this campaign with others, it's easy with the Indiegogo Share tools, and you can also post and share on social media.  You can even help us pull off our first concert behind the scenes.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I'm trying to crowdfund money for Smash Mouth's new album. They have a perk to let me sing vocals on their new album. Of course I want to do it but it's a lot of money, so this is where you come in, I need your help!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I need about $1500. Here's how that breaks down:</p>
<ul>
<li>$1000 for the reward.</li>
<li>$75 for the fees IndieGoGo Will Take</li>
<li>$100 for other misc fees.</li>
<li>$325 or so for any travel fees. <ul><li>I'll foot the rest if it's more. </li></ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I have a bunch of great rewards for you. Just look in the sidebar. I'll sing to you, I'll mail you some things, I'll even make videos for you. </p>
<p>All pledgers get some rad BTS access, but like $10 or more gets some additional fun BTS videos. Who knows, maybe if I succeed you'll get some cool videos from the band? I can't control if that'll happen or not, but if it does, that'll be amazing!  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This can be huge. Seriously. Smash Mouth is like the world's biggest and bestest band (next to Miranda Consgrove #headphonesOn). Here's the impact this project can have:</p>
<ul>
<li>I get to meet Smash Mouth</li>
<li>You get to listen and watch some cool videos.</li>
<li>Smash Mouth makes a cool new acoustic album!</li>
<li>Dreams will be made.<ul><li>Some might even be shattered.</li></ul>
</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I'm doing a flexible funding campaign. If I do not reach my goal, I will still pledge to Smash Mouth's new album, I will just probably select a lower tier perk. I'll of course keep you informed. I'm sure we can raise the money, but at the very least I'm sure we can raise the money for me to at least get the album. </p>
<p>If I get just the album I'll share my reactions to it via some video I'll record with my phone. </p>
<p>If I don't meet anywhere near the goal, I'm sure I'll still have some great content to share with the few backers that do support me.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they aren't All Stars. Here's how you can help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go outside. Sign All Star. It's a great song.</li>
<li>Go to a gas station. someBODY will need some change for gas. You can spare it, even if you can't spare it for this campaign.</li>
<li>Share this on Twitter. Tweet SmashMouth. Buy their albums. Support this indiegogo. You can do it. </li>
</ul>
</div><p>And that's all there is to it, All Star. </p></div>","Short Summary

All pledgers get some rad BTS access, but like $10 or more gets some additional fun BTS videos. Who knows, maybe if I succeed you'll get some cool videos from the band? I can't control if that'll happen or not, but if it does, that'll be amazing!  

The Impact
This can be huge. Seriously. Smash Mouth is like the world's biggest and bestest band (next to Miranda Consgrove #headphonesOn). Here's the impact this project can have:

I get to meet Smash Mouth
You get to listen and watch some cool videos.
Smash Mouth makes a cool new acoustic album!
Dreams will be made.Some might even be shattered.



Risks & Challenges
I'm doing a flexible funding campaign. If I do not reach my goal, I will still pledge to Smash Mouth's new album, I will just probably select a lower tier perk. I'll of course keep you informed. I'm sure we can raise the money, but at the very least I'm sure we can raise the money for me to at least get the album. 
If I get just the album I'll share my reactions to it via some video I'll record with my phone. 
If I don't meet anywhere near the goal, I'm sure I'll still have some great content to share with the few backers that do support me.

Other Ways You Can Help
Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they aren't All Stars. Here's how you can help:

Go outside. Sign All Star. It's a great song.
Go to a gas station. someBODY will need some change for gas. You can spare it, even if you can't spare it for this campaign.
Share this on Twitter. Tweet SmashMouth. Buy their albums. Support this indiegogo. You can do it. 

And that's all there is to it, All Star.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello my Ladies in Waiting (Potential name for the fan base but I'm still taking suggestions). I have just recently released my first ever single titled ""Baroque"" and I need your help to get the music video produced. Beginning my career as an actress in LA, I've been doing it all to pay the bills. Babysitting, waitressing, being a cashier, and MLM pyramid schemes all at the same time. Yet I was still getting burn out by barely paying off my finances. And on top of that I wanted to stunt on these h**s by trying to look like the daughter of a failed reality TV star with my Goodwill Budget and my roommates hand me downs. A Gen- Z problem indeed. I've always wanted to write and produce music but have always refrained from doing so. But with my situation giving me depression and wanting to try something different with my life, I channeled my frustration into writing this funny yet relatable banger! And of course, I needed to compliment the song with an equally clever music video to do it justice. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The music video has a very simple structure. My head will be placed on various 17th century paintings whilst singing the song. But all of the magic is in the editing. Your donation will provide...</p>
<ul>
<li>A proper editor who can flawlessly attach my face to these paintings and color grade my skin tone to match as close as possible (Not a lot of black representation back then).</li>
<li>Fund the space, lighting, and director, to get this process done!</li>
</ul>
<p>And thats it! Not only is the idea simple because that's how I see it, but I want to take the appropriate precautions for the safety of my crew in the wake of the pandemic. That means limited people on set and social distancing!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>A music video really can push a musicians career forward to reach a much wider audience. I'm hoping that eventually I become mainstream and possibly open doors for more black females to write funny songs that people can bump their heads to. My catalog may not all be about the humorous things, but as of now thats all I can write about! While I still have a passion in acting and film making, I believe this music career will help me explore different parts of my artistry that I haven't been able to fully tap into before.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I think the biggest risk is timing. With the pandemic going on the entertainment industry is taking everything on a day by day basis. I'm hoping to get the video finished by the end of the month so I can be able to release other projects that I'm currently working on in time. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Stream and share my song! Available on all platforms such as Spotify, Amazon Music, Itunes, and Deezer!</p>

<p>Hey! </p>
<p>My name is Karen, and before we get started, please know I do NOT want to speak to your manager…I want to make movies. </p>
<p>Being a woman of color and first generation American, provided me with the drive and ambition necessary to pursue the art of storytelling. I have made it my mission to direct projects that help inspire younger girls, coming from any social or economic background, to realize their infinite potential. </p>
<p>This mission would be insurmountable without my creative partners at Greater Boston Artist Collective, otherwise known as GBAC. GBAC is a collection of female artists across all mediums based in Boston, MA. Our focus is to give artists a platform to share their work. We accomplish this by hosting live musical events, art shows, and through the power of film. </p>
<p>Money is not our motive, but it is how we are able to keep giving artists opportunities to shine, which is why we humbly come to you for help on our next project, a music video for the song ‘Chop.’ </p>
<p>Chop, performed by SHELLZ and Dutch Rebelle, two female rappers from Haitian descent, is a song about cutting out the negatives in life, and continue moving forward with your head held high. GBAC is honored to amplify black voices and give them the opportunity to share their message with the masses.</p>
<p>In this video, we pay homage to Kendrick Lamar, Beyonce, Nicki Minaj, J. Cole and countless other inspiring black artists that have shared their journey of struggle and prosperity with a world that was not set up for them to succeed.</p>
<p>As you can see on our <a href=""http://greaterbostonartistcollective.squarespace.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">WEBSITE</a> we've created some amazing films with little to no money. This requires our crew to dedicate our time for free, despite needing to make rent. With the added difficulties provided by 2020, our team is not able to fully finance all of our work, but with your contribution we can continue to raise voices through the arts, while also putting food on our tables. </p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>Our goal is to raise $5,000. Making our goal means we can provide safer and better working conditions for our crew, and pay them what they deserve, this being our top priority. </p>
<p>Our locations are booked, our gear is rented and our talent is ready to perform ALL OUT. We have been able to get this far with just GBAC’s imagination and drive, but with your support we can elevate this project to the next level. </p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p> <p>The message behind Chop is one this world is so desperately needing right now. A message of positivity, unity, inclusivity and triumph in the face of tragedy. With an army of women behind you, there is no obstacle you cannot overcome. </p>
<p>You may have seen our last video with Shellz, called <a href=""https://youtu.be/1Zti0WZIfkw"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">SOULZ</a>. A project fully funded from our own pockets, which has now surpassed 67K views! Making it onto MTV on demand, Music Choice on demand, and finally BET channels! With your support today, we have the opportunity to reach even further. </p>
<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
<p>GBAC has and will always be passionate enough to collaborate, even if it means not having the funds, but due to COVID, we have to ensure all of our members are financially safe and secure during these trying times. </p>
<p>There are many avenues you can take to help us bring this vision to life. Music performances, art auctions, master classes offered by our members.</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p> <p>Every dollar counts! GBAC understands that not everyone can help financially during these tough times. Even just sharing this link and spreading awareness in our fundraising campaign would be tremendous. The fact that you have read all of this so far, already means the world to us! </p> <p>We are all puzzle pieces of a bigger picture. GBAC is an all women group, we are Latina, Armenian, and of Italian descent. We believe in chosen family, unity, and love. Our different backgrounds, our hardships and successes are the backbone of our stories. </p>
<p>Every painting, every film, every piece of art GBAC creates, is never self serving. We don’t sit around and talk about what we can do for our community, we are out there serving it. Thank you for your continued support, for believing in the power of women, the power of POC and the power of our creative community.</p>
</div></div>","Hey! 
My name is Karen, and before we get started, please know I do NOT want to speak to your manager…I want to make movies. 
Being a woman of color and first generation American, provided me with the drive and ambition necessary to pursue the art of storytelling. I have made it my mission to direct projects that help inspire younger girls, coming from any social or economic background, to realize their infinite potential. 
This mission would be insurmountable without my creative partners at Greater Boston Artist Collective, otherwise known as GBAC. GBAC is a collection of female artists across all mediums based in Boston, MA. Our focus is to give artists a platform to share their work. We accomplish this by hosting live musical events, art shows, and through the power of film. 
Money is not our motive, but it is how we are able to keep giving artists opportunities to shine, which is why we humbly come to you for help on our next project, a music video for the song ‘Chop.’ 
Chop, performed by SHELLZ and Dutch Rebelle, two female rappers from Haitian descent, is a song about cutting out the negatives in life, and continue moving forward with your head held high. GBAC is honored to amplify black voices and give them the opportunity to share their message with the masses.
In this video, we pay homage to Kendrick Lamar, Beyonce, Nicki Minaj, J. Cole and countless other inspiring black artists that have shared their journey of struggle and prosperity with a world that was not set up for them to succeed.
As you can see on our WEBSITE we've created some amazing films with little to no money. This requires our crew to dedicate our time for free, despite needing to make rent. With the added difficulties provided by 2020, our team is not able to fully finance all of our work, but with your contribution we can continue to raise voices through the arts, while also putting food on our tables. 
What We Need & What You Get
Our goal is to raise $5,000. Making our goal means we can provide safer and better working conditions for our crew, and pay them what they deserve, this being our top priority. 
Our locations are booked, our gear is rented and our talent is ready to perform ALL OUT. We have been able to get this far with just GBAC’s imagination and drive, but with your support we can elevate this project to the next level. 
The Impact The message behind Chop is one this world is so desperately needing right now. A message of positivity, unity, inclusivity and triumph in the face of tragedy. With an army of women behind you, there is no obstacle you cannot overcome. 
You may have seen our last video with Shellz, called SOULZ. A project fully funded from our own pockets, which has now surpassed 67K views! Making it onto MTV on demand, Music Choice on demand, and finally BET channels! With your support today, we have the opportunity to reach even further. 
Risks & Challenges
GBAC has and will always be passionate enough to collaborate, even if it means not having the funds, but due to COVID, we have to ensure all of our members are financially safe and secure during these trying times. 
There are many avenues you can take to help us bring this vision to life. Music performances, art auctions, master classes offered by our members.
Other Ways You Can Help Every dollar counts! GBAC understands that not everyone can help financially during these tough times. Even just sharing this link and spreading awareness in our fundraising campaign would be tremendous. The fact that you have read all of this so far, already means the world to us!  We are all puzzle pieces of a bigger picture. GBAC is an all women group, we are Latina, Armenian, and of Italian descent. We believe in chosen family, unity, and love. Our different backgrounds, our hardships and successes are the backbone of our stories. 
Every painting, every film, every piece of art GBAC creates, is never self serving. We don’t sit around and talk about what we can do for our community, we are out there serving it. Thank you for your continued support, for believing in the power of women, the power of POC and the power of our creative community.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>My name is Bianca Bernardi and I am a Singer/Songwriter/Musician based out of Dundas, Ontario, Canada. Music has always been ""it"" for me. I was 6 months old when I was on my first stage and I feel like I've never left. It's been 6 years since I released my debut self-titled EP. A lot has changed, a lot of life has been lived and a lot of songs have been written. </p>
<p>For obvious reasons, this year has been different. I went from playing consistently and having many gigs on the horizon to going months without performing at all, all while in the beginning stages of recording my first full length album. Before the world turned upside down, I was self-funding this album through gigs, teaching and a full-time job. All of that stopped and so with the halt in work came a halt in production. </p>
<p>By contributing to this campaign you will help me finish what I started. There is nothing that I want more than to have this music in your hands. <br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Being an independent artist &amp; self-funding is a challenge, even without a pandemic. Your contribution would allow me to finish the 4 songs that are recorded and complete 6 more songs for the record. </p>

</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>To be honest with you, this all feels a little strange to me. I've always prided myself on being fiercely independent, so asking for help doesn't exactly come naturally or easily. But I believe in this music. I believe in this project and the people involved. And I believe that asking for help to get these songs out into the world is what I am supposed to be doing right now. So thank you for contributing, in any way, and for helping and hearing me. <br/> </p>

Beaucoup de choses ont changé, beaucoup de morceaux de vie ont été vécus, et beaucoup de chansons ont été écrites.</p>
<p>Pour des raisons évidentes, cette année a été différente. Je suis passée de faire de la musique sans cesse, avoir plein de concerts prévus à ne plus faire de musique (sur scène) du tout pendant des mois ; tout ça alors que je commençais tout juste à enregistrer mon premier album. Avant que le monde ne tombe à la renverse, je finançais moi même l’enregistrement de l’album grâce à mes concerts, l’enseignement et un travail à plein temps. Tout ça s’est arrêté, et qui dit un arrêt du travail dit un arrêt de la production de l’album.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi I’m Chris Komer,  Founder/Director of The Artists Refuge at Thunderhead near Hughesville, Montana.  We are a fully accredited non-profit organization with 501(c)(3) status so all of your contributions will be tax deductable.  I’m a musician/artist living in New York City but in the summer, with the help of many volunteers I am building a rustic retreat for artists and creative people from all walks of life.  We will be opening up on a limited basis this summer but due to the COVID-19 crisis our funds have been impacted and we need to increase our funding in order to be able to accommodate and feed our volunteers who are helping to build our small village.  The money will also go towards building supplies.  In order to do this we are making a push to attract new members to be a part of our community.  Our usual membership fee is $100 to join and $35 a year to keep the membership current.  But for the duration of this campaign we will only be asking $70 to join.   As a member you become part of our unique, organic community of adventurous, creative people from all over the world and will be  able to participate in the planning and growing of the project.   It is truly a group vision and every idea is added to the soup and considered.  You will also receive special discounts to stay in our cabins (if you volunteer to work as well it is free depending on availability)  and invitations to special events when they start to occur in the not so distant future.  You will also always be welcome to reserve campsites on the grounds of Thunderhead (subject to availability) free of charge.  </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are shooting for $15,000 but even $5,000 will allow us to make some progress.  With our own sawmill (bought with our last IndieGoGo campaign) and with half of our 60 acres solid forest we are able to build very, very inexpensively using mostly standing dead pine or dead fall that has yet to begin to rot.          </p>
<p>Right now and for the foreseeable future Thunderhead is a working retreat.  Last summer we had 50 volunteers and artists come thru Thunderhead during the course of the summer to help us build more infrastructure.  The food budget averaged about $600 a week and another $11,000 was spent on building materials.  Much progress was made however as we came closer to completing the Poets Cafe,  built another new cabin and added a solar powered water pump to our spring box and ran new water lines to many of our structures.  </p>
<p>Not only are we offering a discount on new memberships but we are offering ridiculous deals on renting our cabins to be used anytime within the next 3 years!  3 meals a day included!  (July and August)</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>During this crisis it became clear to me and many others just how special a live performance is.  You don’t know what you have until it’s gone.  Right now it is unclear when they will begin again.  Performing artists and artists of all types are struggling to make ends meet during this time and are in dire need of support and community.  Thunderhead helps to provide that community and is a place where artists (professional or amateur) can go to heal, find support and create.   It’s quite a magical place.  Ask anyone who has been.   I offer two quotes below.   </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Feedback left by Jeppe Hastrup  (Denmark)</p>
<p>There is nothing other than this to say about this place: Go! You'll never regret it!<br/>Chris is an amazing, inspiring person with realistic plans to achieve his dream of an artist refuge, and he is well on the way already. The work is fun, but it doesn't hold a candle to all the late-night campfire jam sessions, delicious food and thousands of laughs. This was my first Workaway, and I literally cannot recommend it enough. I will be telling my friends, grandparents and strangers that I pass on the street about this place.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Feedback left by April Weathers (Alabama, USA)</p>
<p>This is now my favorite place on earth! It became my home away from home. I actually ended up staying two weeks longer than planned and still didn't want to leave when the time came. Chris has created a magical place where inspiration is practically in the air you breathe. The creativity is tangible, and if you are experiencing a creative block, consider yourself unblocked. Seriously, if you have the opportunity to stay here, I HIGHLY recomend it!! The work is hard but fun, the food is great, and the people are the best of the best. I can't wait to go back!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Founded in 2007, we have been growing every summer.   Since we are used to operating on a shoestring budget we have learned how to build structures very inexpensively using our own natural resources and our own portable saw mill.  We use solar power and employ other eco conscious building techniques.  (One cabin has a living roof!)</p>
<p>Our plan is to build a small village capable of hosting up to 50 creative folks at a time and To eventually host workshops and an eventual diverse festival of art and music and dance.   We are not in a rush though and our timeline is flexible.   We grow as fast as we have funds and volunteers to lend a hand.  </p>
<p> </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Can't contribute?  That doesn't mean you can't help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Please help get the word out and make some noise about our campaign!</li>
<li>Introduce people to our project by using the share tools provided by IndieGoGo, and keep us in mind in the future as a donor or a volunteer.</li>

Hi I’m Chris Komer,  Founder/Director of The Artists Refuge at Thunderhead near Hughesville, Montana.  We are a fully accredited non-profit organization with 501(c)(3) status so all of your contributions will be tax deductable.  I’m a musician/artist living in New York City but in the summer, with the help of many volunteers I am building a rustic retreat for artists and creative people from all walks of life.  We will be opening up on a limited basis this summer but due to the COVID-19 crisis our funds have been impacted and we need to increase our funding in order to be able to accommodate and feed our volunteers who are helping to build our small village.  The money will also go towards building supplies.  In order to do this we are making a push to attract new members to be a part of our community.  Our usual membership fee is $100 to join and $35 a year to keep the membership current.  But for the duration of this campaign we will only be asking $70 to join.   As a member you become part of our unique, organic community of adventurous, creative people from all over the world and will be  able to participate in the planning and growing of the project.   It is truly a group vision and every idea is added to the soup and considered.  You will also receive special discounts to stay in our cabins (if you volunteer to work as well it is free depending on availability)  and invitations to special events when they start to occur in the not so distant future.  You will also always be welcome to reserve campsites on the grounds of Thunderhead (subject to availability) free of charge.  
 
What We Need & What You Get
We are shooting for $15,000 but even $5,000 will allow us to make some progress.  With our own sawmill (bought with our last IndieGoGo campaign) and with half of our 60 acres solid forest we are able to build very, very inexpensively using mostly standing dead pine or dead fall that has yet to begin to rot.          
Right now and for the foreseeable future Thunderhead is a working retreat.  Last summer we had 50 volunteers and artists come thru Thunderhead during the course of the summer to help us build more infrastructure.  The food budget averaged about $600 a week and another $11,000 was spent on building materials.  Much progress was made however as we came closer to completing the Poets Cafe,  built another new cabin and added a solar powered water pump to our spring box and ran new water lines to many of our structures.  
Not only are we offering a discount on new memberships but we are offering ridiculous deals on renting our cabins to be used anytime within the next 3 years!  3 meals a day included!  (July and August)
 
The Impact
During this crisis it became clear to me and many others just how special a live performance is.  You don’t know what you have until it’s gone.  Right now it is unclear when they will begin again.  Performing artists and artists of all types are struggling to make ends meet during this time and are in dire need of support and community.  Thunderhead helps to provide that community and is a place where artists (professional or amateur) can go to heal, find support and create.   It’s quite a magical place.  Ask anyone who has been.   I offer two quotes below.   
 
Feedback left by Jeppe Hastrup  (Denmark)
There is nothing other than this to say about this place: Go! You'll never regret it!Chris is an amazing, inspiring person with realistic plans to achieve his dream of an artist refuge, and he is well on the way already. The work is fun, but it doesn't hold a candle to all the late-night campfire jam sessions, delicious food and thousands of laughs. This was my first Workaway, and I literally cannot recommend it enough. I will be telling my friends, grandparents and strangers that I pass on the street about this place.
 
Feedback left by April Weathers (Alabama, USA)
This is now my favorite place on earth! It became my home away from home. I actually ended up staying two weeks longer than planned and still didn't want to leave when the time came. Chris has created a magical place where inspiration is practically in the air you breathe. The creativity is tangible, and if you are experiencing a creative block, consider yourself unblocked. Seriously, if you have the opportunity to stay here, I HIGHLY recomend it!! The work is hard but fun, the food is great, and the people are the best of the best. I can't wait to go back!
 

Risks & Challenges
Founded in 2007, we have been growing every summer.   Since we are used to operating on a shoestring budget we have learned how to build structures very inexpensively using our own natural resources and our own portable saw mill.  We use solar power and employ other eco conscious building techniques.  (One cabin has a living roof!)
Our plan is to build a small village capable of hosting up to 50 creative folks at a time and To eventually host workshops and an eventual diverse festival of art and music and dance.   We are not in a rush though and our timeline is flexible.   We grow as fast as we have funds and volunteers to lend a hand.

<h3>Fresh Vinyl from Jefferson Berry &amp; the UAC</h3>
<p>You or someone you know is in love with their record collection.  Old fashioned? Maybe.  But the clarity and warmth of vinyl is a thing of beauty.  And it's making a big come back with people who are serious about their music.</p>
<p>Double Deadbolt Logic was released this Spring, right before the pandemic hit. I love these songs and while the timing of the CD was COVID challenged, the release of the <strong>12"" vinyl version of Double Deadbolt Logic </strong>is perfect for the holidays.</p>
<p>The test pressing of this record really reveals the production values we were shooting for when we recorded it. It's a record that will make your gift list rock.</p>
<h3>Limited Vinyl Pressing</h3>
</div><div>
<p>We'll be receiving our shipment of 200 discs on December 1st. We'd like to get half of them out on pre-order to our friends. Preorders should arrive by December 12th with modest postage (which is included in the cost). The more folks you have on your holiday gift list, the more you will save.</p>
<ul>
<li>$30 FOR ONE COPY OF DOUBLE DEADBOLT LOGIC</li>
<li>$50 FOR TWO COPIES OF DOUBLE DEADBOLT LOGIC*</li>
<li>$60 FOR THREE COPIES OF DOUBLE DEADBOLT LOGIC*</li>
</ul>
<p>         *. Includes Perks!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>COVID &amp; the Musician's Dilemma</h3>
<p>While we haven't been able to play these songs live as much as we like (there was <strong><a href=""https://youtu.be/bgdqMYg9WGw"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Porch Show</a>,</strong> it was a blast)--folks have been digging our songs on Spotify and YouTube.  <strong>Get to the Shore </strong>is over 10,000 plays on Spotify.  <strong>Ghost of California</strong> and <strong>At the Festival</strong> are both around 500 views on YouTube.</p>
<p>But really, musicians need to play out to recoup the costs of producing records. So this Holiday Gift Giving Season, we hope you'll support the local cats who miss playing for you live by purchasing vinyl and CDs.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Guarantee</h3>
<p>There are always risks to these type of fundraisers.  The ""what ifs"".  I guarantee to ship all preorders by December 3rd with media mail postage included. Orders received after December 5th will get bumped up to first class postage.  Need a card to go with a present, we can handle that.</p>
<p>And wait until you hear this! I loved this CD, but the vinyl....mmmm!</p>

While we haven't been able to play these songs live as much as we like (there was The Porch Show, it was a blast)--folks have been digging our songs on Spotify and YouTube.  Get to the Shore is over 10,000 plays on Spotify.  Ghost of California and At the Festival are both around 500 views on YouTube.
But really, musicians need to play out to recoup the costs of producing records. So this Holiday Gift Giving Season, we hope you'll support the local cats who miss playing for you live by purchasing vinyl and CDs.

Guarantee
There are always risks to these type of fundraisers.  The ""what ifs"".  I guarantee to ship all preorders by December 3rd with media mail postage included. Orders received after December 5th will get bumped up to first class postage.  Need a card to go with a present, we can handle that.
And wait until you hear this! I loved this CD, but the vinyl....mmmm!",0.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<p>Peace and love fam! As an independent artist, the new normal due to the Covid-19 pandemic has discontinued some of the most efficient ways I have been able to sustain in my profession and give you the music and content you've grown to enjoy and appreciate from me. With that being said, I wanted to reach out to my village of fans and supporters to assist in my effort to build my home studio so I can continue to create my soul's expressions. As a token of my appreciation for your support, you will receive a signed copy of my next studio album Boundless Wavelengths before the general public! </p>

<h3>2020 Changed The Game</h3>
<p>I am absolutely conscious of the gravity of the decision to ask for support for my cause when so many of my people are in the midst of their own challenges trying to navigate this new normal and economy due to Covid-19. If I don't receive a dime from my campaign, I would totally understand. I also understand the power of faith, not only in God but in my community. Support goes way beyond finances, and even if you're personally unable to support financially you may know someone that may see this as a righteous cause, and that would help me tremendously.</p>

<p>Nikki Oniyome recently released the slow disco song save me, and their core listeners covered their tears with glitter and gave it a spin. The upcoming album, however, is constituted of ambient and mournful beats, this time experimenting with new-age elements and psychoacoustics.</p>
<p>With a slight nod to the works of Portishead, Björk, Fever Ray, Lamb, and other forms of weird and existential beats, the song based album is colored by unusual sounds and weird ideas in the production, making an alluring backdrop to the distinct female vocal.</p>
<p>Try out some sad beats you can't help but dance to. Cover your tears with glitter and give Nikki Oniyome a spin in the video above. Immerse yourself in the mournful beats of Nikki and let's make this album happen together. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Who are we, you might ask?</h3>
<p>Nikki Oniyome is the heart child of songwriter, vocalist and guitarist Lisa Canlinha, producer Jørgen Skjulstad (aka Center of the Universe), and bass player Vebjørn Axelsen. In 2017 they released their first two singles, followed by their debut EP 水 Sui/Mizu in 2018, described by reviewers as «strangely beautiful and strangely twisted» (Your Dead Partner), captivating «with unusual sounds, weird ideas and a successful production» (Global Music Magazine).</p>
<p>We are part of the music collective Metronomicon Audio, consisting of a wide range of affiliates which together aim to promote new and interesting music. We have chosen to focus on individual members’ freedom to make music they like, and the community has a flat structure where the artists themselves have full artistic control.  </p>
<p>Metronomicon Audio started in 2001. As of today the community has produced more than 100 releases. Among these we find in addition to a lot of CDR and CD and vinyls, even more obscure formats such as circuit boards and USB sticks.  </p>
<p>So as you understand, we are independent artists, which means we rely 100% on our fans to help us continue making music. If you purchase anything directly from us - whether a t-shirt, digital or physical music - you can rest assured that you've just done a very good thing in supporting music</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Money Talk</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Mastering and pressing of Vinyl and CD costs us €4,000.  </strong>Being part of a music collective we are so lucky to have access to our own studio at just €800 a year as a membership. The recording, studio work, editing and mixing has been done for free by the excellent Jørgen Skjulstad (who is in fact quite a reputable producer here in Norway!) just because his heart is of pure gold. This has been paid for by blood, sweat and tears, including funds from gigs we play, and synchronistic blessings along our path! Our dream is merely that this album will be self-liquidating, that means that sales will pay for all the costs of what it takes for us to make this music. </li>
<li>
<strong>A music video by Melissa Follestad costs us from €1,000 and €2,000 to record.</strong> Follestad has until now made all of the videos for free for us. Through her art film company Monkeyhill Creations, she has recent years become increasingly reknown, collaborating with Norwegian stardoms such as Gundelach. There is only until a certain moment that such an artist can do work otherwise paid for free. With your help, we can continue the visual profile that Melissa has established for us, by creating more stunning music videos to color our music. </li>
<li>
<strong>It costs us €500/month to do a minimum of PR during the launch. </strong>If we try to do PR around the launch for 4 months, that's €2000. </li>
<li>
<strong>Our goal is to raise €7,000  </strong>to pay for the mastering and pressing of vinyl and CD, as well as the music video and PR required to bring this album to life. You with us? </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Limited edition bundle of unsigned or signed vinyl and CDs. </strong> We have pressed a very limited edition of each physical item. Depending on how much of a co-creator of this album would you like to be, there will be additional perks like specially designed and signed t-shirts and art work, polaroid photos from the studio sessions, and hand written lyrics for those who really want to be a intimate part of our crew. </li>
<li>
<strong>Host a House Concert. </strong>We are currently booking a Nikki Oniyome 2020 tour! Hop on our tour schedule now and we will offer a House Concert in your community or playing a private show for you and your closest friends or your favorite organization. </li>
<li>
<strong>Sponsor a video. </strong>For those interested in putting their creative stamp on this project, there are a limited number of videos available, 6 to be exact. Sponsor a video and choose which song you will bring to life. Listen to the new music in it's entirety before everyone else and take a 'sneak peek' at the creative vision for the video you are bringing to life. Send an email to nikki@nikkioniyome.no if you would like to claim a video. </li>
<li>
<strong>Swag. </strong>There WILL BE plenty of opportunities for you to wear our t-shirt, raise your glass, and show off your support in the name of mournful bliss. Stay tuned as the reward section will expand and contract throughout the campaign. </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We are  100% independent and it is entirely up to two people - Nikki &amp; Jørgen - to be responsible for all the financing, managing of the entire project, the merchandice -- the lot!  It's quite an undertaking and many people do not understand why we bother to invest this much into this musical project just for the love of it.  </p>
<p>Most people today are used to streaming music for free or a small monthly fee, and have little knowledge of the cost behind much of the music they are listening to. Especially when you are doing it without the support from one of the major labels! </p>
<p>We do this because we prefer the freedom to make whatever music we choose, without the middle men in corporate suits. As a consequence of this, we have been blessed with a very intimate relationship with our listeners. You, our listener, enables us to create music off the beaten track and made for all the musical loners out there. </p>
<p>By pre-ordering a bundle for a limited time you become a trusted part of the team surrounding us. Your contribution is what will bring this album into the world. </p>

<h3>Help make Marissa's 4th album</h3>
<p><i>“Marissa writes really catchy songs that draw you in with the melody, but keep you with the smart lyrics. Ever since I heard her for the first time, I wanted to hear more.”</i></p>
<p style=""text-align: right;""><strong>- Lisa Loeb [Grammy-winning Singer/Songwriter]</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>It has been almost 8 years since I released 63 Songs About Joe and that is far too long. Time to record a new EP with some of the songs I've been writing lately.</p>
<p>For the past 5 years I have been spending my summers at a songwriting retreat with the lovely and talented <a href=""http://darwilliams.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dar Williams</a>. From those retreats I have a trunk full of more mature and emotional songs just waiting to be recorded and put out into the world. That is why I'm asking for help.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h3>
<p>It takes money to record an album, even an EP. I plan on traveling up to Medford, MA where I recorded <a href=""https://open.spotify.com/album/4wPgYiURhjADkz9KyIF2w1?si=uVl1mMnFRzOQTYaGPFvo_w"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">63 Songs About Joe</a> and work with the very talented Ducky Carlisle in his studio with producer Brian King of the band <a href=""https://parksband.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Parks</a>.  The studio, Ducky and Brian all cost money.  In addition, I would like to hire a publicist to help spread the word once the record is done.</p>
<p>The good news is 1/5 songs is already recorded, mixed and mastered so I only need to record 4 more songs.</p>
<p>I would like to raise $10,000 to make this album. It's a large sum on money but not impossible to raise. This would pay for studio time, musicians for the record, mixing and mastering of the record and marketing and publicity to get the record out in the world.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Perks</h3>
<p>For perks I will be offering downloads of the record when it's complete, gift sets of my past records, mystery merch bags, cakes, performances, custom songs and more! But don't do it for the perks, do it for the music!</p>

<h3>Mental Health Day - The Band</h3>
<p>As a band, we focus on music that moves us. We write songs that mean something to us. The band name is a play on words, sure, but it's also something that matters to us. This new album reflects the struggles we (us and you!) go through in life, and how important it is to keep fighting, and keep talking. It's about 2nd and 3rd and 4th chances. It's about getting a little better ever time. It's about struggling even when things are good. It's about helping each other. It's about continuing to live. And most importantly, it's about never, EVER giving up. </p>
<p>This campaign for us is not about the money, though it will help. We'll be putting this record out even if we don't raise a dime. It's about connecting with you, and trying to get the music and message out to as many people as we possibly can.  We want to build a community, and to support each other, even outside of the music. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Let's break it down in more detail:</p>
<ul>
<li>Any money we do receive will go initially to recouping costs of post-production. </li>
<li>Anything beyond that, we will reinvest in the band. Equipment, tee-shirts, stickers.</li>
<li>Even if we don't reach any specific monetary goals, we will still be putting the album out and making it available to purchase and stream. </li>
<li>We're creating tiered reward systems with lots of fun little perks for your donations.</li>
</ul>
</div><div><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3></div><div>
<p>We understand that some people would like to help, but aren't able to make financial contributions. That's okay! You can still help!</p>

<li>Spread the word! Please forward this campaign to other friends and family. There are sharing options below!</li>
<li>Keep listening to songs (Our first album is still available for purchase and streaming on just about all of the major platforms such as iTunes, Spotify, etc...).</li>
<li>Come out to shows! Most of our shows are free or very cheap, and we'd love to see you there.</li>

<h2>Eugen Botos</h2>
<p>Young passionate keyboardist and composer is a multi-talented musical visionary who has found a way to break down the boundaries and brought together the often unfairly separated worlds of contemporary jazz fusion and urban pop music.</p>
<p>At the conservatory (2002) he founded a jazz-funk band titled “Eugen Botos Finally“ with Robert Vizvari (bassist) and Martin Koleda (guitarist). All of them were brought up on Chick Corea ́s Electric Band and Mark King ́s Level 42. They has spanned the musical genres of contemporary jazz fusion, R&amp;B, funk, urban pop music, hip-hop, etno and latin music. Eugen Botos and his music can be definitely seen as a new fresh and innovating energy in the jazz genre.</p>
<p>The band became more visible in 2008 when Eugen started to cooperate with famous American saxophonist Eric Marienthal and Finally became his band for European concerts. These performances moved them forward to finish their debut album called My Space (2010). There are also another famous guests, great musicians, on this album as Canadian bassist Alain Caron, Venezuelan pianist Otmaro Ruiz, bassist Janek Gwizdala, guitarist Harri Stojka and American pianist Peter Horvath.</p>
<p>In 2011 the band Finally had a concert tour in Slovakia with great musician Gary Bias, the saxophonist from the band Earth Wind and Fire. In 2013 Finally and Sheldon Reynolds had a concert tour throughout central Europe and in 2014 the band appeared again at Bratislava Jazz Days. Eugen Botos and Finally are relesed a second CD album (Final Definition) which was released in japan label P-Vine in 2016 with many special guests again like: Brian McKnight – R&amp;B singer, Maysa Leak - smooth jazz singer also known as a former singer of British band Incognito, Sheldon Reynolds - singer of Eart Wind and Fire, Eric Marienthal saxophone player, Angela Johnson - jazz singer, Jeff Lorber - jazz piano player and producer, Marcus Miller multiinstrumentalist and bass guitar player, Brian McKnight – R&amp;B singer , legendary Dionne Warwick sings on Botos tune called ""Symphony of broken hearts"", Victor Wooten play bass battle with Robert Vizvari on track "" L.A. Funk"". “From that point, the writing and recording of Final Definition was something like a puzzle, but also full of many dreams come true, as I began working with so many artists who are heroes of mine, from Dave Weckl and Marcus Miller to Victor Wooten and Brian McKnight,” says Botos. “I draw from many musical influences, including the fusion jazz we did on My Space, as well as pop, pop-jazz, R&amp;B, funk and even Latin music.</p>
<p>In 2019 Eugene Botos invite for his Slovakian tour one of the most talented drummer - Pete Ray Biggin from Level 42. They record one of their live performance in club Blue Note and Eugene wants to released this fantastic concert on DVD and CD.</p>
<p>With this campaign, I am asking all of you to be directly involved in this project from the very start so that I can complete my LIVE DVD record. Thats why we asks for a crowdfunding.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Jeremy Crooks, also known as Made By Crooks, and I'm an artist based in Pasadena, CA by way of Sacramento, CA. For the past year, I've been performing at shows all around California promoting my latest album <a href=""http://open.spotify.com/album/0voHlNsPlvD1HToYo6wWTu"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">ALLISON</a>. It has been a dream of mine to be able to tour this album, and the time has finally come!</p>
<p>I've been blessed enough to be able to partner with <a href=""https://sofarsounds.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">SoFar Sounds</a> for a west coast tour this summer, from Southern California all the way up to Vancouver! SoFar Sounds is a highly regarded organization that throws secret shows in over 400 cities around the world. My band and I have personally performed already at SoFar San Francisco and SoFar San Diego, and every show sells out well in advance. The shows cater to a stripped back, acoustic sound, offering an intimate experience for listeners, and a chance for artists to personally connect with potential fans and supporters. Artists like <a href=""https://youtu.be/fwC30E1IVKQ"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Billie Eilish</a>, <a href=""https://youtu.be/UTxa6HTIecw"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Ed Sheeran</a>, <a href=""http://youtu.be/9H3BzKhSHgY"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Leon Bridges</a>, <a href=""https://youtu.be/_Xw7qKZxUA8"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Lianne La Havas</a>, and <a href=""https://youtu.be/RXwE1G7_U9M"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Yebba</a> have performed for SoFar in their careers.</p>
<p>This tour would allow audiences in other cities and states the ability to experience a full live set from my band and me. We've been polishing our set since October of last year, and we would love to be able to perform music for audiences all over!</p>
<p>This is where I need your help! My band and I are all still up-and-coming, and that means that we all work part time or full time jobs in addition to pursuing our dreams. As much as this 3 1/2 week tour will be great at gaining us some momentum, it'll also be hitting us hard on our wallets. It would be amazing to have some financial support, so we can carry out this entire tour without financial stress being a factor. We've all spent well into a decade working at our individual crafts, and can assure an amazing show wherever we go. In exchange for your contributions, I'm offering some awesome gifts and perks!</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>My goal is $12,000 and funds from this campaign will go directly into compensating my band, travel costs, food and lodging.</p>
<p>We have 8 contribution tiers for supporters to choose from!</p>
<ul>
<li>The first tier is the <strong>“Aye, you’re pretty good”</strong> package, which includes a written Thank You card, Made By Crooks stickers, MBC Logo Pin, and a signed copy of ALLISON.</li>
<li>The second tier is the <strong>“Your music is nice”</strong> package, which includes everything in the first tier, plus an MBC Dad Hat (color of your choice) and an invite to a secret album release show for my next project. That’s right, I’m holding a secret album release show for my next project and Indiegogo contributors will have an exclusive invite to it!</li>
<li>The third tier is the <strong>“I really dig your merch”</strong> package, which includes everything in the second tier plus an MBC Long Sleeve shirt.</li>
<li>The fourth tier is the <strong>“For real, I fux with you heavy”</strong> package, which includes everything in the third tier plus an MBC hoodie of your choice and the option of getting the MBC Patch Tee instead of MBC Long Sleeve shirt.</li>
<li>The fifth tier is the <strong>“I’ve been a fan since Day 1”</strong> package, which includes everything in the fourth tier plus an extra MBC Dad Hat and Thank You credits on the next album. I’ma give you a proper shout out for being down with my work for real for real.</li>
<li>The sixth tier is the <strong>“I’ma need everything you got”</strong> package, which includes an MBC Dad Hat in every color, both MBC hoodies, the MBC Long Sleeve shirt, MBC Patch Tee, along with a written Thank You card, MBC Logo pin, signed copy of ALLISON, invite to the secret album release show AND Thank You credits on the next project. Basically, it’s a steal meant for the truest Crooks supporter.</li>
<li>The seventh tier is the <strong>“I wanna get to know you thru more than just the music”</strong> package, which includes everything in the sixth tier plus a Meet and Greet Lunch with yours truly. We’ll go out for a bit, eat a dope meal at a fairly expensive joint, and chop it up on whatever you wanna talk about.</li>
<li>The eighth and last tier is the <strong>“P. Diddy, I wanna be all up in the music video”</strong> package. This includes everything in the sixth tier plus a cameo in my next music video. You’ll forever be ingrained in Made By Crooks history, and can tell your kids...look! I starred in a music video before that guy blew up!</li>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This tour would not only be extremely important for my music, but also for my band. I always work hard with the intention of providing opportunities for the ones around me. This tour would give my band and me great exposure in cities some of us have never even been to. It'll also give audiences in other cities and states the chance to experience a really dope set of music! Plus, with your contribution, you would allow us the opportunity to focus solely on the music, without the worry of being able to pay rent, pay bills, or eat food when we get back. For me personally, you'll be helping kick start my leap of faith into doing music full time. This tour can be a great success, but it can also carry a lot of risks. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Organizing a tour is a feat in and of itself. Most bands have a manager, booking agent, or tour manager to help plan and route a tour. For me, I went ahead and planned the entire tour myself with some added help of SoFar Sounds SF City Director, Karim Saleh. We reached out to a bunch of SoFar cities on the West Coast and were able to get in contact with a good portion of them, enough to route a tour! The challenge now is funding the tour. I've been reaching out to brands for sponsorship, saved up some of my own money, and am launching this Indiegogo campaign to try to reach my calculated budget for the tour.</p>
<p>The tour budget will be used to compensate my bandmates, take care of food, travel and lodging expenses. Since we'll be out for three weeks or so, some of us will either be taking extended leaves of absence from work, using up a TON of PTO, or just quitting our jobs! It's pretty insane, but is also personifies the belief and willingness to take risks that's needed to keep momentum moving in the music industry. It's a tough business for sure, and requires a lot of sacrifice. We're hoping with your help, we can take some of the mental stress and load off of our financial plates, so we won't be worrying quite as much when we get back from tour.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I would love for your contribution at any capacity! Purchasing any of the 8 tiers of Perks would be amazing for my band and me, but we could also just use your help in spreading this Indiegogo campaign around!</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
My name is Jeremy Crooks, also known as Made By Crooks, and I'm an artist based in Pasadena, CA by way of Sacramento, CA. For the past year, I've been performing at shows all around California promoting my latest album ALLISON. It has been a dream of mine to be able to tour this album, and the time has finally come!
I've been blessed enough to be able to partner with SoFar Sounds for a west coast tour this summer, from Southern California all the way up to Vancouver! SoFar Sounds is a highly regarded organization that throws secret shows in over 400 cities around the world. My band and I have personally performed already at SoFar San Francisco and SoFar San Diego, and every show sells out well in advance. The shows cater to a stripped back, acoustic sound, offering an intimate experience for listeners, and a chance for artists to personally connect with potential fans and supporters. Artists like Billie Eilish, Ed Sheeran, Leon Bridges, Lianne La Havas, and Yebba have performed for SoFar in their careers.
This tour would allow audiences in other cities and states the ability to experience a full live set from my band and me. We've been polishing our set since October of last year, and we would love to be able to perform music for audiences all over!
This is where I need your help! My band and I are all still up-and-coming, and that means that we all work part time or full time jobs in addition to pursuing our dreams. As much as this 3 1/2 week tour will be great at gaining us some momentum, it'll also be hitting us hard on our wallets. It would be amazing to have some financial support, so we can carry out this entire tour without financial stress being a factor. We've all spent well into a decade working at our individual crafts, and can assure an amazing show wherever we go. In exchange for your contributions, I'm offering some awesome gifts and perks!

If you are unable to contribute, sharing this cause is vey helpful as well :)Music is medicine and this world is definitely in need of more medicine. I hope to be able to continuously support the beings of this planet by sharing my gifts and I hope you continue to share yours as well! Thank you again!! PS. I will also be sharing 2 new songs with the crowd and will be live streaming the whole show!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3><strong>A Note from Chris</strong></h3>
<p><i>Hey Friends!</i></p>
<p><i>I'm inviting you to join me as I record my new studio album!     </i></p>
<p>Early in 2020, I had just started working on my new record. Then COVID hit and turned all our lives upside down. My entire 2020 tour schedule disappeared instantly, and the revenue I was relying on to finance the record evaporated almost overnight.</p>
<p>While I’m very grateful for the extra time I’ve been able to spend with my family, and keeping them safe has been my top priority, I'm not giving up on this project.  </p>
<p>While I've been able to complete some of the record, and have been funding it myself so far, I’m seeking your help in completing it.</p>
<p>I am kindly asking you to<strong> please pre-purchase it now </strong>so my team and I can afford to finish it.  </p>
<p>I know times are tough for everyone, and we are not seeking donations, but pre-purchasing it now will make all the difference - we need the funds to keep going!  </p>
<p>If you are interested, there are <strong>additional perks </strong>available, such as my personal songwriting journals, studio visits, guitar lessons, a house concert, etc.  Take a look to see if something suits your budget!</p>
<p>If you've enjoyed my past albums, and are excited to hear the latest,<strong> please pick an incentive that fits your budget and join our team!</strong></p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>The Team</strong></h3>
<p>The new record is being co-produced by myself and Juno-Award winning producer<strong> Derek Downham </strong>(<i>Paul Reddick, Broken Social Scene</i>), engineered by Grammy Award-winner <strong>Jeremy Darby </strong>(<i>David Bowie, Lou Reed, Alicia Keys, Van Morrison, Sara Bareilles), </i>and features some of my favourite musicians, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Alan Zemaitis </strong>(keys)</li>
<li>
<strong>Riley O'Connor</strong> and Derek Downham (drums)</li>
<li>Our dear friend, the late-great <b>Guenther Kapelle </b>(bass)</li>
<li>Juno and Maple Blues Award-winning keyboardist <b>Jesse O'Brien</b> (<i>Colin James, Harrison Kennedy</i>)</li>
<li>Two-time Grammy Award-winner <b>Mike Mattison</b> (<i>Tedeschi-Trucks Band, Derek Trucks Band</i>) - guest vocals on a tune.</li>
<li>Juno Award-nominee <b>Alison Young </b>and Juno Award-winner <b>Richard Underhill </b>co-arranging horns.</li>
<li>Other guest stars to be announced.</li>
<li>For those outside of Canada, a Juno Award is the Canadian equivalent of a Grammy award.</li>
</ul>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>The New Songs</strong></h3>
<p>In 2018, my last album “Monarch” was nominated for <strong>Record of the Year</strong> at Canada’s Maple Blues Awards (and myself for <strong>Producer of the Year</strong>).  I am very grateful for this recognition as that record was a very personal work dealing with loss, divorce, forgiveness, and the art of letting go.</p>
<p>This new record chronicles my life as a single parent of two children, building an enriching home life for them, and strengthening the community around us.</p>
<p>When I began to write this record, I read something by Carl Jung, who said ""<i>in the second half of our lives, humans reconnect with the human race</i>. <i>They become part of the collective once again</i>.” These words really resonated with me and became the starting point of this new record - songs of <b>community, self-compassion, hope, and belonging</b>.</p>
<p>While I started writing these songs prior to COVID, they have since taken on even more importance, especially now when we’re all so far apart from each other.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The themes on this record, include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The power of community.  </li>
<li>The power of home - building a new home with my children in the aftermath of a divorce.</li>
<li>Seeking out positive role models for my children – striving to be a good example for them, but also lamenting the absence of strong role models amongst certain political leaders.</li>
<li>My sobriety - at the end of 2018, I gave up alcohol for good, after finally acknowledging it was a problem in my life. I’ve been sober now for over two years, and I’m very proud of this.</li>
</ul>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>The Sound</strong></h3>
<p>Over the course of the last three albums, three Maple Blues award-nominations, international radio play, several international tours, and even playing on stage with <strong>Buddy Guy </strong>three times, I have been exploring various aspects of blues, roots and blues-rock traditions. </p>
<p>Now I'm making a more modern, progressive blues-rock album with heightened mainstream potential, not beholden to the ""rules"" of blues, but respectful of tradition, weaving classic with contemporary - adventurous, but not polarizing; stretching every idea across the aural spectrum.</p>
<p>Of course, traditional blues lovers will dig the handful of traditional blues numbers; I know my roots and will never abandon them.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>What We Need and What You Get</strong></h3>
</div><div>
<p>We're asking you to <strong>pre-purchase</strong> the record now because we want to make it in the best possible way (with the talent mentioned above ), and<b> we want to do it right!!</b></p>

<h3><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></h3>
<p>There are always risks in the music business, especially when making independent records.  However, I have an excellent track record for managing and delivering projects of this magnitude, and I am well-prepared to deal with any hurdles as they arise.</p>
<p>Since 2010, I have successfully financed and produced three large-scale and critically acclaimed recordings (featuring Juno- and Grammy-award winning musicians).</p>
<p>The planning for this campaign alone has been months in the making. PLUS, I have a GREAT team working with me to make sure that everything runs smoothly.</p>
<p>The plan is to release the record in late 2021. However, we may hit some logistical roadblocks and delays due to COVID but we will get it to you.</p>

<h3>Help Me Release My Latest Project of Steely Dan Music! </h3>
<p>My name is Donovan Raitt, and I play acoustic fingerstyle guitar music. While working on my DMA degree at the USC Thornton school of music, I started working on a series of solo guitar arrangments of one of my favorite groups, the legendary Steely Dan! I started on this project in order to better understand their unique use of jazz-influenced harmony in the framework of pop music song structures, and it evolved into a set of arrangements of 11 of their best-known tracks, which I premiered live in a recital in the spring of 2020. </p>
<p>My goal with this project is to create a combination of a CD release as well as a transcription set of each arrangement that will be made into a book, complete with a section containing historical background and performance notes for each arrangement. </p>
<p>I would also like to professionally record videos of each song to go along with this book/cd set so anyone who wants to learn how to play these arrangments can watch the videos and see how they are performed from multiple angles and close-up shots of each hand.</p>
<h3>Goals and Budget</h3>
<p>The good news is that all of the <strong>arrangements are already recorded and the transcriptions are already complete! </strong>The reason that I am putting on this campaign is to help cover the remaining costs that are needed to fully fund this project. These include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Mixing/mastering the recording.</li>
<li>CD and book printing and duplication</li>
<li>Artwork and book layout.</li>
<li>Professional video shoot and video editing. </li>
<li> Licensing and song clearances.</li>
</ol>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This project has been very challenging to complete, yet has been one of the most rewarding things I have ever done in my musical career. I am so proud of these arrangements and I want to share them with everyone! I know there are lots of fans of Steely Dan out there, and I think they will really enjoy hearing each part of their favorite tracks arranged for solo acoustic guitar. </p>
<p>Long term, my goal with this project is to have it professionally published and distributed, and I hope with your help we can make that a reality!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Since the recordings and transcription are already ""in the can"" so to speak, the major challenge here is purely a financial one. This project will be completed, I just need your help! </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>In addition to supporting this project financially, Spreading the word and telling your friends and family about it is so important in helping me reach this goal. I hope that you will consider supporting this project and sharing it on your social media platforms! </p>
