<h3>Just the Facts</h3>
<p>Water is something everything needs to survive.  The water crisis is something that everyone needs to be concerned about.  Rainfall amounts worldwide are falling leading to continued droughts and the inability to produce food.  However, while rainfall drops, there is still water vapour in the air.  Best of all, this water vapour is constantly being replenished.  It is replenished through the natural evaporation that takes place on the oceans, lakes, rivers, dams etc.  Ground moisture evaporates to provide atmospheric vapour.  Every living person (and animal) contributes to this vapour through the moisture that is exhaled every time you breathe out. </p>
<p>I live in one of those areas currently affected by drought.  The farmers in my area are not planting crops because they do not have enough water to grow them.  Farm animals are dying from dehydration or starvation simply because of the lack of water.  The water supply for towns in my area is running dry.  This is not something isolated to Australia, worldwide this is happening. </p>
<p>The effects of low rainfall are massive.  Without adequate rainfall farmers are reliant on bores or river systems to grow crops.  Drawing water from the river systems reduces the amount of flow available downstream.  This results in the river ecosystem being impacted negatively because without adequate flow the ecosystem of the river and the surrounding land starts to break down.  Water drawn from bores is not being replenished because of low rainfall and these will eventually run dry as well.</p>
<p>However while the rain does not fall, humidity levels in the air are still reasonable.  I have come up with a new way of drawing the humidity from the air and producing water at a quality that is suitable for human consumption.  My idea is also able to be increased in size to produce large amounts of water using only renewable energy sources.  This will have a massive impact worldwide.  Imagine being able to know you have water for your family that isn't contaminated.  That you have enough water for your animals.  That you can grow a crop or keep fruit trees alive even if the rain doesn't fall.</p>
<p>Eventually our models will range from small units the size of a water filter to provide a constant supply of fresh water for you or your pet (especially good if you have to go away and have someone else look after them - no worries about knocking the water bowl over) through to large units the size of shipping containers that can provide enough supply for multiple people in emergencies.  The technology can even be scaled up to full building size to supplement town or city water supplies.  It can also be scaled down to a backpack to provide water for a hike or camping trip.  These machines will also allow people in cities who are unable to access water any other way than buying bottled water or using tap water to drink water that does not contain fluoride or other additives that they don't want.  It will be fresh, clean and uncontaminated - just pure water.</p>

<h3>How The Machine Works</h3>
<p>By creating an artificial dewpoint you are able to condense the water vapour that exists in the air.  Think a cold drink on a hot day - how long before the glass or can is dripping with moisture? </p>
<p>The best way I can describe the whole process is by telling you the way I first thought of it.  I was in my car and backed out of where I was parked.  I looked back at where I was parked and in the time it took me to start the car and reverse out a pool of water had formed underneath it.  It was from the air conditioning.  So I started doing research on the systems and found that there are some outside Australia who produce these systems but they essentially use a form of air conditioner.  Looking at it I reworked the entire designs to be more energy efficient. </p>
<p>The design that I have come up with is adaptable so you can build bigger or smaller units with not much change to the systems.  For example with the prototype in a given environmental range I might produce 4 litres of water. By adding another condensation component I produce 8. </p>
<p>Even in the driest deserts there is still humidity in the air and as the air gets hotter its' ability to hold water also increases.  At 20 degrees Celsius the air can hold 18ml of water per cubic metre and at 30 degrees that increases to 30ml.  So using those figures at if you have 18ml of water in the air at 20 degrees it is 100% relative humidity and at 30 degrees it is 60% relative humidity.  If you have any questions please don't hesitate to get in contact and ask.  </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>To take this project through to production stage of these units, seed funding of $50 000 AUD is required.  This will take the project from development through to production of the first units.  I have designs and have a theoretical model.  A prototype model is being built right now. </p>
<p>Perks:</p>
<p>$10 - I will send you a personal thank you email which will be the same for all donors. </p>
<p>$100 - will get your name printed in our perpetual list of donors which will be displayed on our website and in our head office (once we actually have an office).</p>
<p>$1000 - will get you a small machine that should generate up to 10 litres per day plus your name on our donor list. </p>
<p>$2 000 - will get you a medium unit that should generate up to 100 litres per day plus your name on our donor list. </p>
<p>$5 000 - will get you a large unit that should generate up to 500 litres per day plus your name on our donor list. </p>
<p>These are the initial perks and as funding progresses we will be able to provide more details.</p>
<p>If the full funding is not reached then we will utilise what we have and bootstrap the company until we have reached our goal.  This is what I have been doing up until this point. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This will transform the world as we know it.  No longer will people need to be within a certain distance of a lake or river or well to access water. No longer will people need to be worried about drinking contaminated water.  Having enough rain to water stock or grow crops will be a thing of the past.</p>
<p>This will also have a positive effect on the environment.  With farms being able to rely on water being generated by these machines they will no longer have to draw water from bores or rivers.  The underground aquifers will have a chance to refill.  Without the amount of water being drawn from the river systems, the river ecosystems and ecology of the surrounding areas will be able to recover.  The areas that are dying simply because of lack of river flow will be able to flourish once again, allowing the native wildlife to return to their former habitats.</p>
<p>My aim with the company is that once profits are being generated, those profits will go directly to funding machines to be provided to those people who need them for free.  This means communities worldwide could benefit from having access to clean water, the machine being a donation from the profits. </p>
<p>I am a stubborn and driven person and am determined to make this a reality, even if I have to fund all of it by myself.</p>

Water is something everything needs to survive.  The water crisis is something that everyone needs to be concerned about.  Rainfall amounts worldwide are falling leading to continued droughts and the inability to produce food.  However, while rainfall drops, there is still water vapour in the air.  Best of all, this water vapour is constantly being replenished.  It is replenished through the natural evaporation that takes place on the oceans, lakes, rivers, dams etc.  Ground moisture evaporates to provide atmospheric vapour.  Every living person (and animal) contributes to this vapour through the moisture that is exhaled every time you breathe out. 
I live in one of those areas currently affected by drought.  The farmers in my area are not planting crops because they do not have enough water to grow them.  Farm animals are dying from dehydration or starvation simply because of the lack of water.  The water supply for towns in my area is running dry.  This is not something isolated to Australia, worldwide this is happening.

<h3>What is this?</h3>
<p>Part of the solution to the climate crisis is to create a device that brings renewable energy production and storage to the individual in a way that has the lowest carbon footprint. I solely designed and manufactured a versatile portable electric storage and generator that I call a ℒightℂube. It is now built from plant-based plastics on 3D printers powered by 5 other ℒightℂubes. The ℒightℂube has a 1500W pure sine inverter with 2 outlets, a 2.4kWh battery, and a charge controller that handles up to 400W of solar. But this is still in the prototyping stage!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What am I asking for?</h3>
<ul>
<li>The prototype price I am asking for is double the potential sale price. Each backer would in essence be giving us both a ℒightℂube, so I can expand the self-powered production capacity.</li>
<li>Acquiring the requested number of backers for receiving prototype would allow me to produce enough ℒightℂubes to fulfill the prototype orders in a few weeks.</li>
<li>Once this production system is created in a place with a lot of sun, I can focus my attention on the next step of including a made-in-America IoT communication device that broadcasts  WiFi and Bluetooth to host a web-based ℒightℂube status/control user interface. This can be configured to extend wifi networks, create a ℒightℂube mesh network, store data, host websites, perform math &amp; science, etc.</li>
<li>I quit my job around <strong>e</strong> years ago, anticipating that in order to have the ability to open-source this project I would need to completely own my intellectual property. The open-source perk is around the salary I would have made had I not done this project. I have a patent pending with the ℒightℂube, but focusing on completing that would slow my progress. I will instead open source the project if someone buys the perk (as well as sending them the tooling for producing their own ℒightℂubes). If multiple open source perks occur, I will provide educational videos and livestreams of the development process. If all the open source perks are paid, all the prototype backers will receive production tooling to make a ℒightℂubes.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>If all the suppliers of each component (and their suppliers, etc) were to switch to renewable energy (preferably using the ℒightℂube), producing ℒightℂubes would be a carbon-negative process from just the carbon sequestered into the plant-based plastic.</li>
<li>I will be replacing internal components with the most locally sourced components I can find, ideally by creating them myself.</li>
<li>The ℒightℂube has a lower carbon footprint than any similar device because it is being produced by one person that already lives off of renewable energy from the ℒightℂube.</li>
<li>A half size version is in the works, with pricing low enough to be affordable to almost everyone who can afford a cellphone.</li>
<li>My initial inspiration was to create a large scale version of a plant cell. The ℒightℂube  is the mitochondria, the solar panels are the chloroplasts, and the 3D printers are the ribosomes. This project is the seed for an artificial tree.</li>
<li>The long term goal for any renewable energy company is to transform the carbon economy. I have many other inventions to share and will bring them into existence as soon as I can start working on them.</li>
<li>After more than 2 years without a job, I have reached the point financially where I can't progress unless all the prototypes are backed. I sold my house to raise money to acquire land with more sunlight.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I need to move to a place with more sunlight, and acquire or build a structure to manufacture in that has better climate conditions than an outdoor tent with mesh doors, and this poses a risk to the delivery time frame. Geopolitical developments can always pose risks to sourcing tooling and components, but in the long run this risk becomes eliminated as I integrate production vertically.</p>
<p>I only tested a couple of component suppliers, and would like to try to use as many as possible to find the best products. The prototype ℒightℂube you receive might not use the same components as the final production ℒightℂube.</p>
<p>This is a large workload for a single person, and there is a limit to the number of ℒightℂubes I can produce on my own in a single week. I think at least 10 a week will be easily feasible, and improvements to automation can increase that substantially.</p>
<p>I have very little waste in production and there is the potential to reclaim waste material to make it waste-free.</p>

If you have an existing irrigation system you can use the Wet-WickTM  Complete 3 in 1 Irrigation System to act as a ""safety net"" for watering your plants. By adding this to your existing system you can go on holiday without any concern about power failures causing electronic timers to fail and your plants to suffer or die.
Perfect for rain water collection tanks. Due to the low water usage and pressure required you can now use your roof to collect and feed your garden, NO PUMPS, NO ELECTRICITY needed.
The Wet-WickTM  Complete 3 in 1 Irrigation System is particularly well suited to raised beds. As raised beds tend to provide great drainage, they also tend to dry out very quickly. The Wet-WickTM  technology will help prevent this.
If you live in an apartment and only have space for container grown plants, the Wet-WickTM Complete 3 in 1 Irrigation System will allow you to set up a small patio garden in no time. Due to the fact that the containers are not “over watered” as is usually the case with containers, the unsightly mess caused by runoff is avoided.
Why not collect all the waste water from your air conditioning unit? With the Wet-WickTM Complete 3 in 1 Irrigation System you too can MAKE EVERY DROP COUNT!!
What does it include?Each Wet-WickTM Complete 3 in 1 Irrigation System includes:
Water reservoir with lid
25 complete Wet-WickTM  water dispensing units(pre assembled for your convenience)
100 re-usable wicks
20 meters of 6mm micro tubing
1 inlet adaptor(quick coupler)
1 mini float valve(water level regulator)
2 micro valves and 1 micro filter
The ImpactFrom an environmental point of view our system can really make a big impact. The world is starting to realize that water is our single most valuable commodity; there truly is nothing that we can do without water and our system MAKES EVERY DROP COUNT. We believe that by getting as many units in as many homes as possible, we can help make the most of the water available. By also reducing the threats posed by run-off caused by the inefficient use of fertilizers, the positive effects can be compounded. Education is the cornerstone of progress. By educating consumers and our youth about the ways in which we can simply use water more efficiently, whilst at the same time making it more convenient to grow plants and trees or any of the life giving flora that sustain us, we believe that we can truly change the world!!!We believe that our product has to be more than something that you buy because you want to do the right thing, it's great if that is the case, but we want it to also make your life easier, save you time, and ultimately save you money!!! Convenience, Cost and Conservation.",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>My name is Xavier Rodriguez, CEO of Dax Multi-Media-Marketing.</p>
<p>I have successfully designed, manufactured, and tested, what I believe to be the future of mobile advertising or Mobiletising as I like to call it! </p>
<p>An example of what I have created can be found on my website:<br/>daxmarketinghelp.com/Mobiletising</p>
<p>or via the video provided.</p>
<p>The device has come a long way since, for example. The unit is made of aluminum and completely waterproof. It comes with an internal lithium battery, solar power, alarm system, gps tracking and much more.. With the consumer in mind our unit is extremely user friendly connecting via smart device (Included in purchase) to showcase your ads. Also with a quick disconnect the unit is easily removable from the roof of your vehicle and can be stored away!</p>
<p>I have a manufacturer to create the housing already, I am simply looking for funds to push the project to the next level. I am seeking 5,000 dollars to finalize the prototype and get the units ready to be sold. Funds will go to parts, manufacturing, and marketing. For whatever reason the goal is not met, funds will still be put forth to getting the unit ready for mass production.</p>
<p>Mobiletising is the first of its kind! Help me showcase to the world the future of mobile digital advertising! With this device companies can now cut the billboard costs and showcase there ads when and how they want! No longer will you have to pay to have one ad shown in one location! With mobiletising you can showcase as many ads as you desire and showcase them anywhere a vehicle is permitted!</p>
<p>The unit has undergone several testing phases and each has been met with its own unique solution. With my creative background and help from a few engineers I have been able to overcome every obstacle to bring this project to life!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Karlis i'm 27 years old and want to create new product for my country  to save forests from cutting and earth from air pollution. I created my business and started to write projects, started with European union projects who help people with funding. They accepted my business plan and give small amount of funds to buy biomass rotary dryer but need all other devices to start productions, so i find crowd funding with hopes that someone will help me. </p>
<p>Project is based to ecological and earth friendly product creating. We will offer it to households and companies who use coal and other earth unfriendly product as firing fuel, to save trees and earth for next generations. Peat is ecological product and renewable. After firing it makes heating power very big such as best quality coal but leaves smallest amount of dusts and they are usable as fertilizer for garden.</p>
<p>If we reach 50000 dollar funding we will be able to buy biomass rotary dryer </p>

Mist tracks soil moisture, sun intensity and temperature data in realtime and automatically optimizes irrigation for each part of your yard while using up to 50% less water.

MIST PRODUCT DEMONSTRATION





NEW FEATURE: DROUGHT MODE









Mist offers the world's-first ""drought mode"" setting that can be used when available water supplies are scarce. When selected, Mist applies the minimum amount needed to keep your drought-vulnerable plants alive. This is only possible thanks to Mist's advanced realtime sensors.




PERFECT AUTONOMOUS WATERING
 Mist uses wireless moisture sensors to measure real-time water needs across the yard and then waters autonomously and on-demand keeping your lawn and garden healthy with no effort at all. This means you never have to bother with tweaking your sprinkler timer settings again.









ADVANCED YARD TRACKING
Mist sensors track soil moisture, temperature and sun intensity data from any point of your property both in realtime and in aggregate. Mist combines this knowledge about your yard with weather information and watering history and uses these insights to water the perfect amount every time.





REMOTE CONTROL & MONITORING
The Mist app provides you with full control over all the functions of your sprinkler system, including manually turning on/off watering zones, setting restricted days and hours to avoid watering, and setting advanced watering customizations.

<p><strong>Hello the world !</strong> <i>Salut le monde !</i></p>
<p><strong>We launched in one ago an association with the objective to provide innovative solutions for a sustainable world. During the COP22, the MIPAI launched ""Light Us"", a concrete initiative to raise awareness about the critically of fighting climate change. The MIPAI Institute members designed and manufactured a universal symbol, a photovoltaic and intelligent Torch that will be transmitted from one Conference of the Parties (COP) organizing nation to the other, similarly to the Olympic Flame. The Torch will travel from COP to COP to promote sustainable mobility. MIPAI ensured the first relay by bringing Light Us from Paris (COP21) to Marrakesh (COP22), on a series of seven TESLA cars, and presented the Light Us technology and objectives during the COP22.</strong></p>
<p><i>Nous avons lancé il y a un an  l’association MIPAI dont le but est de proposer des solutions innovantes afin de  bâtir un monde plus respectueux de l’environnement. Le premier projet de l’association est de proposer un symbole à l’image de la flamme des jeux olympique, symbole qui sera transmis du pays organisateur de COP à un autre tel le  témoin  d’un monde durable. De cette idée est née «  LIGHT US », une torche dont le prototype a été transporté par l’équipe MIPAI de Paris (COP 21) à Marrakech ( COP 22) en Novembre 2016 lors de la 1ère édition du Light Us Relay qui fut couronnée de succès. Le projet « Light Us » fut nommé, par ailleurs, parmi les 4 innovations de la COP22. <a href=""http://telquel.ma/2016/11/14/5-innovations-ecologiques-en-marge-cop22_1523500"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://telquel.ma/2016/11/14/5-innovations-ecologiques-en-marge-cop22_1523500</a></i></p>

Hello the world ! Salut le monde !
We launched in one ago an association with the objective to provide innovative solutions for a sustainable world. During the COP22, the MIPAI launched ""Light Us"", a concrete initiative to raise awareness about the critically of fighting climate change. The MIPAI Institute members designed and manufactured a universal symbol, a photovoltaic and intelligent Torch that will be transmitted from one Conference of the Parties (COP) organizing nation to the other, similarly to the Olympic Flame. The Torch will travel from COP to COP to promote sustainable mobility. MIPAI ensured the first relay by bringing Light Us from Paris (COP21) to Marrakesh (COP22), on a series of seven TESLA cars, and presented the Light Us technology and objectives during the COP22.
Nous avons lancé il y a un an  l’association MIPAI dont le but est de proposer des solutions innovantes afin de  bâtir un monde plus respectueux de l’environnement. Le premier projet de l’association est de proposer un symbole à l’image de la flamme des jeux olympique, symbole qui sera transmis du pays organisateur de COP à un autre tel le  témoin  d’un monde durable. De cette idée est née «  LIGHT US », une torche dont le prototype a été transporté par l’équipe MIPAI de Paris (COP 21) à Marrakech ( COP 22) en Novembre 2016 lors de la 1ère édition du Light Us Relay qui fut couronnée de succès. Le projet « Light Us » fut nommé, par ailleurs, parmi les 4 innovations de la COP22. http://telquel.ma/2016/11/14/5-innovations-ecologiques-en-marge-cop22_1523500

We would like to take this opportunity to offer you to participate in a project history : we propose to produce a new symbol for sustainable development : the smart torch « Light Us ». Designed and produced by ordinary citizens of the world, she will educate humanity on the issue of global warming that threatens our future. The final version will be present in October 29 of 2017 in Marrakech.
Pour la 2ème édition, Nous aimerions saisir cette opportunité pour vous proposer de participer à notre projet historique: finaliser la production de ce nouveau symbole pour le développement durable, La Torche intelligente ""Light Us"" ! Elle est conçue et produite par d'ordinaires citoyens du monde et elle permettra de sensibiliser l'humanité sur la question de réchauffement climatique qui menace notre avenir. La version finale sera dévoilée le 29 octobre 2017 à Marrakech.
To present this torch, we will forward it from Paris to Marrakech in electric vehicle  during a single event : The Light Us Sustainable Relay. This will allow us to demonstrate that we can design to travel differently , in the interest of all. 
Le prototype de Light Us fut acheminé de Paris à Marrakech en véhicules électriques dans le cadre de la 1ére édition du Relais Durable « Light us ». Nous avons pu démontré au monde que nous pouvons concevoir de voyager autrement, dans l'intérêt de tous.

Starting from COP22, the States that will receive the COP will transmit the torch as in an Olympic relay. If we succeed in making the issue of global warming a priority, then we will all have contributed to a future for our children.
À partir de la COP22, les Etats qui recevront la COP se transmettront la torche « Light Us » comme le relais Olympique. Si nous parvenons à rendre la question du réchauffement climatique une priorité, alors nous aurons tous contribués à offrir un avenir meilleur à nos enfants. 
Light Us Sustainable Relay – Road To COP22
Last year we have submitted the project to the scientific committee of the COP22, which was evaluated positively our project. We thank the organizing committee of the COP22 and the Minister of Environment of Morocco , Mrs. Hakima El Haite , who testified his support on social media !
L’année dernière nous avons soumis le projet au Comité Scientifique de la COP22 qui a positivement évalué notre projet ! Nous remercions le Comité d'Organisation de la COP22 ainsi que la Ministre de l'Environnement du Maroc -  Madame Hakima El Haite - qui nous a témoigné son soutien  sur les réseaux sociaux !

Light Us Sustainable Relay – Road To COP23
This year too, the ""light us"" project has been labeled by the COP23 committee !!!
Cette année aussi, le projet « Light us » a été labélisé par le comité de la COP23 !!!
We also discuss with private partners, we hope to see many around this event.
Nous discutons également avec des partenaires privés. Nous espérons les voir nombreux nous soutenir pour cet événement.

Through the Light Us caravan and its Sustainable Relay, the MIPAI association wanted to demonstrate that we can now travel long distances in an electric vehicle, thus enticing the Mediterranean people to change their way of traveling to preserve the environment. For this year of 2017, 20 TESLA cars will migrate from Morocco to Germany, the hosting country of the COP23 that is under the chairmanship of Fiji with Light Us on board.
A travers la caravane Light Us et son Relais Durable, l’association MIPAI souhaitait démontrer que l’on peut désormais parcourir de longues distances en véhicules électriques, et ainsi inciter les méditerranéens à changer leur façon de voyager dans le but de préserver l’environnement. Pour cette année 2017, 20 TESLA vont migrer du Maroc jusqu’en Allemagne, pays hôte de la COP23 sous la présidence des Iles Fidji avec la torche Light Us à Bord.
The ""Light Us Sustanaible Relay"" is a green tourist rally to promote sustainable mobility and to bring the Light Us Torch from Marrakech (COP22) to Bonn (COP23)..You will participate in a historic Rally with landscapes and unforgettable events !The challenge is to make 3500 kms in 8 days by minimizing their consumption in an eco-driving logic. There is no notion of speed or regularity. Participants drive at their own pace in accordance with the traffic rules and safety requirements. This historic rally will cross 6 countries -Morocco / Spain / France / Switzerland / Belgium / Germany-

<p><strong>About me and my project</strong></p>
<p>Hello, my name is Liviu Cezar, I am an engineer, I have a master's degree in Energy at UTCB (Technical University of Civil Engineering Bucharest). I have been working for the last 7 years in a heating, ventilation and air conditioning company (HVAC). My dream is to build energy-independent houses, protect the environment by reducing the pollution due to the production of energy by burning coal and hydrocarbons and to teach people to build their own solar houses as well.</p>
<p>Expert tests have demonstrated that a small 3 kW solar power plant will save about 800 kg of CO2 per year - that is, the amount of CO2 emitted by a car that runs 10,000 kilometers or 6200 miles .</p>
<p>This system is being ideal for your own home. A photovoltaic power plant is in all ways a way of enriching a home, increasing its real estate value, having a particularly long life, and last but not least, the quality of life.</p>
<p>You can help me fulfill my dream, and I can help you to improve your life, the home you live in and together to do great things.</p>
<p>The approximate sum that I need to complete the first project is about $ 200,000. About half of the sum will go on buying the land on which the house will be built, and the other half on the building of the house and on the solar system itself.</p>
<p>After finishing the first solar house and capitalizing on it I will be able to buy land and build other houses that will be sold at affordable prices for future owners.</p>
<p><strong>Perks</strong></p>
<p>My perks for you will be unique. I will document each stage of the house construction and will send you all the details of the photovoltaic system and not only. I will answer your questions about the construction of the house and all the equipment used. Depending on the contribution of everyone, I will send my project (56 pages) in Romanian and English, T-shirts with the Solar Home logo and other rewards.</p>
<p>If I do not manage to raise the entire amount of money I will not give up, but I hope we will succeed together.</p>
<p><strong>Short story about solar cell.</strong></p>
</div><div>
<p>The production of the first solar cell in 1954 in American Bell's laboratories is, however, due to a happy happening. Employees of the firm under Morton Price have noticed when they searched for a silicon rectifier that produced more current when exposed to the sun. As a result, Bell, through Chapin, Fuller and Pearson, developed in 1953 the first silicon arsenic cells contaminated with arsenic but had a yield of only 4%, which was increased to 6% by changing impurities. In 1958, solar cells were tested for the first time on the Vanguard I satellite with a solar panel with 108 silicon solar cells. The results obtained were above expectations - to this day the space probes up to Mars are powered by electricity produced by electric photovoltaic panels, and in 2011 the space probe Juno was launched which is the first Jupiter spacecraft to be supplied with current produced by the cells solar.</p>
<p><strong>Project calculations and design</strong></p>
<p>The calculation for determining the electrical energy produced by photovoltaic panels was carried out in the PVGIS, SMA Sunny Design and PVSOL Expert programs.<br/>For the calculations, the same type of solar panel (Schott Poly) with the same power (180 Wp) was used to compare the results obtained.</p>
<p>The calculation is performed for a number of 15 photovoltaic panels to be mounted on the roof of the house and will be oriented to the South coordinate at an angle of approximately 35.54 degrees as the roof slope is very close to the optimal angle of 35 degrees.<br/>The estimate of the annual average of electricity produced by the photovoltaic system is 3100 kWh.<br/>Nominal photovoltaic system power: 2.7 kWp (silicon);<br/>Estimated losses due to temperatures: 14.5% (relative to the ambient temperature in this area);<br/>Other losses (cables, inverter): 14%<br/>Photovoltaic system losses: 28.5%<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1534971865/uzftkp7smddej60eqnkt.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1534972100/necg0cngl8y6ddey0vtv.png"" src=""""/>This is just a small part of the project and the calculations made. They can be rebuilt and calculated depending on the roof surface or other types of stronger panels can be chosen. They can also be mounted in the yard if there is space on special supports, and they can have an automatic system that tracks the sun's position throughout the day.</p>
<p><strong>Such projects are important for reducing pollution and greenhouse gases and for being energy independent. I hope that together we will achieve as many such projects worldwide and thus have a major impact on the quality of life and the protection of the environment.</strong></p>

</div></div>","About me and my project
Hello, my name is Liviu Cezar, I am an engineer, I have a master's degree in Energy at UTCB (Technical University of Civil Engineering Bucharest). I have been working for the last 7 years in a heating, ventilation and air conditioning company (HVAC). My dream is to build energy-independent houses, protect the environment by reducing the pollution due to the production of energy by burning coal and hydrocarbons and to teach people to build their own solar houses as well.
Expert tests have demonstrated that a small 3 kW solar power plant will save about 800 kg of CO2 per year - that is, the amount of CO2 emitted by a car that runs 10,000 kilometers or 6200 miles .
This system is being ideal for your own home. A photovoltaic power plant is in all ways a way of enriching a home, increasing its real estate value, having a particularly long life, and last but not least, the quality of life.
You can help me fulfill my dream, and I can help you to improve your life, the home you live in and together to do great things.
The approximate sum that I need to complete the first project is about $ 200,000. About half of the sum will go on buying the land on which the house will be built, and the other half on the building of the house and on the solar system itself.
After finishing the first solar house and capitalizing on it I will be able to buy land and build other houses that will be sold at affordable prices for future owners.
Perks
My perks for you will be unique. I will document each stage of the house construction and will send you all the details of the photovoltaic system and not only. I will answer your questions about the construction of the house and all the equipment used. Depending on the contribution of everyone, I will send my project (56 pages) in Romanian and English, T-shirts with the Solar Home logo and other rewards.
If I do not manage to raise the entire amount of money I will not give up, but I hope we will succeed together.
Short story about solar cell.

The production of the first solar cell in 1954 in American Bell's laboratories is, however, due to a happy happening. Employees of the firm under Morton Price have noticed when they searched for a silicon rectifier that produced more current when exposed to the sun. As a result, Bell, through Chapin, Fuller and Pearson, developed in 1953 the first silicon arsenic cells contaminated with arsenic but had a yield of only 4%, which was increased to 6% by changing impurities. In 1958, solar cells were tested for the first time on the Vanguard I satellite with a solar panel with 108 silicon solar cells. The results obtained were above expectations - to this day the space probes up to Mars are powered by electricity produced by electric photovoltaic panels, and in 2011 the space probe Juno was launched which is the first Jupiter spacecraft to be supplied with current produced by the cells solar.
Project calculations and design
The calculation for determining the electrical energy produced by photovoltaic panels was carried out in the PVGIS, SMA Sunny Design and PVSOL Expert programs.For the calculations, the same type of solar panel (Schott Poly) with the same power (180 Wp) was used to compare the results obtained.
The calculation is performed for a number of 15 photovoltaic panels to be mounted on the roof of the house and will be oriented to the South coordinate at an angle of approximately 35.54 degrees as the roof slope is very close to the optimal angle of 35 degrees.The estimate of the annual average of electricity produced by the photovoltaic system is 3100 kWh.Nominal photovoltaic system power: 2.7 kWp (silicon);Estimated losses due to temperatures: 14.5% (relative to the ambient temperature in this area);Other losses (cables, inverter): 14%Photovoltaic system losses: 28.5%
This is just a small part of the project and the calculations made. They can be rebuilt and calculated depending on the roof surface or other types of stronger panels can be chosen. They can also be mounted in the yard if there is space on special supports, and they can have an automatic system that tracks the sun's position throughout the day.
Such projects are important for reducing pollution and greenhouse gases and for being energy independent. I hope that together we will achieve as many such projects worldwide and thus have a major impact on the quality of life and the protection of the environment.

<p><strong>What is the Killdozer?</strong></p>
<p>The Killdozer is 85 tons of mechanical hatred, cast iron, steel and concrete. It is also more than 400CV of thrust, to demolish, destroy, crush, trample. Now that you are familiar with the concept, here is a brief introduction to the history of the man, the visionary genius, behind this superb creation.</p>
<p>Marvin John Heemeyer, born October 28, 1951 in South Dakota and died June 4, 2004 in Granby, Colorado was a welder and owner of an American auto muffler store. He built and used the ""Killdozer"", a bulldozer he had spent six months armouring in order to destroy the town of Granby, Colorado on June 4, 2004.</p>
<p>He acquired land in Granby 1992, for a particularly low sum, given that the area was abandoned and not very conducive to any industrial activity. Small detail for the moment, but crucial thereafter: the land has no direct access to the road, and Heemeyer is obliged to take the adjoining land to access his property - which absolutely does not bother anyone, since the plot is abandoned, and belongs to the municipality. Unfortunately, with its small business running particularly well, the town finally understood that the abandoned area had potential to be exploited.</p>
<p>One fine day, Mountain Park Concrete, a local company specializing in the production of concrete, comes to settle on the plot next to that of Marvin. The latter therefore loses his only access to the road, and can no longer reach his property without authorization from Mountain Park - which he is obviously refused.</p>
<p>After launching petitions, exhausting every possible legal remedy imaginable, Marvin predictably finds himself crushed by the implacable administrative-technocratic machine. It is therefore that he envisions a more romantic end to the story.</p>
<p><strong>Why a Killdozer?</strong></p>
<p>Because this artistically engaged and highly symbolic project seems to be the best response to the deplorable management of the health crisis that we are suffering head-on, to the absurd, grotesque and often contradictory measures of a government that sails on sight, because it will represent and carry better than anyone the voice of peripheral France, that of roundabouts and small businesses that have been murdered for many months.</p>
<p>It is also for all these reasons that our Killdozer will be baptized ""Louis VI the Fat"", because he will represent the tutelary figure which the people of France lack today, helpless before the perfidy of the technocratic-administrative plutocracy.</p>
<p>An finally, because for its construction, we are going to solicit and employ many craftsmen, local traders (short circuit), precarious people, looking for employment or reintegrating.</p>
<p>The Killdozer is THE answer to all your worries.</p>

<p>Hi!   I’m Lynn.   I have been a dental hygienist for almost 20 years and have loved (almost) every minute of it.  My husband, Steven, is a handy man and has been in the building/repair business for 30 years.   We both enjoy the way we have been able to help people, albeit in different ways, and want to continue to do so for the rest of our days… </p>
<p>With that said, the physical demand that we both experience on a daily basis has played it toll on us both.  We have back and neck pain that we manage on a daily basis.  So after many conversations about what we can do for the next chapter of our working lives, we agree that we need to find another way to give to our community.   We feel like the way we want to do this is to help people in dealing with end of life of their beloved pets.  We have found aqua cremation as a way for us to do this.  Being eco-friendly is very important to us and this is the most gentle and eco-friendly way to see our furry loved ones off.  The process is much kinder than fire cremation and does not have any toxic bi-products and there is almost no loss of bone tissue as a result.</p>
<p>After the recession hit our economy in the late 2000’s, we experienced a hit to our savings that cost us our retirement savings to survive and then sadly, we lost our home to foreclosure.  We have been working to rebuild, but unfortunately all of our hard work has simply kept our heads above water.  So, in order for us to make our new dream come true, we will need help to purchase the equipment necessary to do the work as well as obtain a space to rent  to work in.</p>

<h2>Hello. We're a small group of scientists and professionals who are petrified about the damage humans are doing to our planet.</h2>
<p> </p>
<h3>⚔️ We are fighting two major problems:</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>The damage plastic-waste is causing to wildlife in the oceans and on land.</p></li>
<li><p>The damage our excessive use of fossil-fuels is doing to our health and the climate. </p></li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3>With your help, this Crowdfund will help build an ecoPlant that can turn non-recyclable waste-plastic, into an ultra-clean fuel. It can clean our oceans of plastic, and our air of poisonous gases. </h3>
<p> </p>
<p>A massive thanks for reading further, from the team: </p>

This is pouring more and more CO2 and other poisonous gasses into our air, dramatically changing our climate. </p>
<p>Change is needed, but it's not happening. <strong>Why?</strong></p>
<p>Put simply, it costs far too much money (£/$/¥/€) to replace all the vehicles &amp; machines in the world today that are using dirty fossil fuels, so people and companies are just not doing it fast enough. </p>
<p>But...</p>
<h3><strong>What if we could replace the dirty fossil-fuel instead?</strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>We've designed a process to create ULTRA-CLEAN-FUEL that <strong>burns with negligible nitrogen (N0x) and sulphur (S0x) emissions. The fuel works on CURRENT vehicles, and produces c.50% less CO2 than traditional fossil-fuels. </strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>(NOx and SOx are the emissions that cause breathing difficulties and early death from pollution. The United Nations (UN) states we need to reduce our CO2 by 50% in the next 10 years to stop catastrophic damage from climate change.)</i></p>
<p><strong>Oh... and the ultra-clean fuel is made ENTIRELY from non-recyclable plastics too! </strong>So it helps remove the world of waste-plastic which ends up in our ocean.  </p>

<p><br/>Using a new (<i>and already commercially tested</i>) scientific technology called 'ThermoCatalytic Pyrolysis', together we'll build an ecoPlant that can turn non-recyclable waste-plastics into ULTRA-clean fuel. </p>
<ul><li>The ecoPlant is designed to have 24/7 operation, and a 40-tonne/day capacity of waste-plastic. That will produce thousands upon thousands of litres of ultra-clean-fuel every DAY!</li></ul>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">➡️ <strong>That's</strong> <strong>enough to fill roughly 500 cars with ultra clean fuel, and remove over 2 MILLION plastic bottles - EVERY DAY! </strong>⬅️</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Our automatic plastic feeding and discharging system means that unlike traditional recycling waste-plastic systems<strong>, WE DO NOT need to sort or </strong>check plastics before entering our ecoPlant, reducing cost and increasing production of the ultra-clean fuel.</p></li>
<li><p>The ecoPlant creates enough power to power itself. There is no incineration process, meaning <b>negligible emissions in production;</b> It really is an <i>ECO</i> plant! </p></li>

<h3> ⭐ When you say 'almost any plastic'...</h3>
<p><br/>...We really mean it! <strong>Today's recycling plants cannot take 90% of all plastic produced</strong>. Worse, if the 10% of the remaining 'good-plastic' isn't clean (or if it is contaminated with stuff such as food) it also has to be sent to landfill, be incinerated or shipped abroad (which can end up in our oceans). </p>
<p>✅ <strong>There are 7 different types of plastic, this ecoPlant can take them all! </strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1544434833/nbyt8ezujvjxp2ckvq11.png"" src=""""/></p>

<li>Even including types of plastic that have high oil yield: PP, PS, LDPE, HDPE<br/> </li>
<li>Some plastic contaminated? Metal slipped in? No problem. The ecoPlant can still work with up to 10% non-plastics in every load. </li>

<p>The ULTRA-clean fuel produced can be used in all today's commercial and residential vehicles and machinery. This means businesses can switch overnight to a cleaner solution.</p>
<p>And businesses will switch because:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>The world wants to be greener </strong>- This provides business who rely on significant amount of dirty-fuel usage to make an immediate positive impact to their carbon footprint.  </li>
<li>
<strong>There's strong demand for it</strong> - The UK renewables and waste-to-energy market is set to reach £425bn by 2020. Together we can move people to ultra-clean energy. </li>
<li>
<strong>Government-backed Initiative</strong> - Governments worldwide continue to invest in the green government- backed renewables energy sector,.</li>
<li>
<strong>Proven Ground-breaking Technology</strong> - The waste-to-energy &amp; clean-fuel market is here to stay. It's commercially tested and  solves two global problems at once.<br/> </li>

<p>We're a small team (Andrew, Adel, Marina, Fernando, and Bertie) who are power-plant, energy, commodities and business professionals.  Between us, over the last 20 years we've built dozens of industrial plants around the world, and traded billions of dollars in commodities - we know the space. </p>
<p>We also have <i>the</i> leading professional in this recycling process, as a founding member of this project. Andrew holds a PHD (doctorate), which was directly focussed on the processes of making non-recyclable waste plastic into ultra-clean fuel. </p>
<p><strong>In 2008 Andrew was the senior member on the team that designed and built a pilot-plant of this technology in Spain, which still runs today!</strong></p>
<p>It's been a long journey. Over the last 10 years the ThermoCatalytic Pyrolysis technology has improved, which means we are now ready to launch our latest and newest plant which we believe can change the world.</p>
<p>We have bundles experience - the experience to build and run the equipment, plus all the technology, patents &amp; processes ready to go. </p>
<p>We now need your support and backing to complete the final due-diligence and 3rd party tests which will enable us to unlock the full funding to launch the plant. </p>

<p>As we mentioned earlier, it costs money to save our planet, which is the main reason humans just aren't doing it. It also costs money to build a CPE ecoPlant.</p>
<p>The fundraising from this crowd-fund is being used to complete the core Due-Diligence which is required to unlock the next £10M - the full cost to build the ecoPlant</p>
<p>✔️ <b>The initial crowd-fund will be used to complete: </b></p>
<ul>
<li>Pre-Permits Application Discussion (PAD) with Municipal Councils and Environmental Agency</li>
<li>Finalize equipment agreements with technology providers (we are building some of the tech ourselves plus will use third-party tech)</li>
<li>Secure lease of site. (we have chosen 3 candidate sites at the time of writing)</li>
<li>Finalise feedstock agreements with local counsels (who are overrun with plastic)</li>
<li>Finalise Off taker agreements with (the people/companies that will use our fuel).</li>
<li><p>Project Development Contract with EPC </p></li>
<li><p>Final project funding which will allow us to complete the ecoPlant.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We commit to update you on our process every 6-8 weeks (and answer as many of your questions in between).</p>
<p><strong>What about over funding?</strong> If we are lucky enough to get the support that takes us beyond our goal, we'll continue looking for support to help build more and more ecoPlants. </p>

⚔️ We are fighting two major problems:

The damage plastic-waste is causing to wildlife in the oceans and on land.
The damage our excessive use of fossil-fuels is doing to our health and the climate. 

 
With your help, this Crowdfund will help build an ecoPlant that can turn non-recyclable waste-plastic, into an ultra-clean fuel. It can clean our oceans of plastic, and our air of poisonous gases. 
 
A massive thanks for reading further, from the team: 

 
 Did you know? 
In 2019 the world will use 500 million more barrels of oil fossil-fuels than it used last year! This is pouring more and more CO2 and other poisonous gasses into our air, dramatically changing our climate. 
Change is needed, but it's not happening. Why?
Put simply, it costs far too much money (£/$/¥/€) to replace all the vehicles & machines in the world today that are using dirty fossil fuels, so people and companies are just not doing it fast enough. 
But...
What if we could replace the dirty fossil-fuel instead?
 
We've designed a process to create ULTRA-CLEAN-FUEL that burns with negligible nitrogen (N0x) and sulphur (S0x) emissions. The fuel works on CURRENT vehicles, and produces c.50% less CO2 than traditional fossil-fuels. 
(NOx and SOx are the emissions that cause breathing difficulties and early death from pollution. The United Nations (UN) states we need to reduce our CO2 by 50% in the next 10 years to stop catastrophic damage from climate change.)
Oh... and the ultra-clean fuel is made ENTIRELY from non-recyclable plastics too! So it helps remove the world of waste-plastic which ends up in our ocean.  

The team on-site from a previous plant.
 
✅ Together let's make it happen 
 
This crowd-fund can help fund the completion of the final due-diligence for the project. On completion (and if successful) this will unlock the pre-arranged funding to build the complete the 1st ecoPlant.
 
In short, this crowd-fund can provide the final funding for us to build the first ecoPlant together!
 

 

⭐ ⭐  The CPE ecoPlant ⭐ ⭐
Using a new (and already commercially tested) scientific technology called 'ThermoCatalytic Pyrolysis', together we'll build an ecoPlant that can turn non-recyclable waste-plastics into ULTRA-clean fuel. 
The ecoPlant is designed to have 24/7 operation, and a 40-tonne/day capacity of waste-plastic. That will produce thousands upon thousands of litres of ultra-clean-fuel every DAY!
➡️ That's enough to fill roughly 500 cars with ultra clean fuel, and remove over 2 MILLION plastic bottles - EVERY DAY! ⬅️

Our automatic plastic feeding and discharging system means that unlike traditional recycling waste-plastic systems, WE DO NOT need to sort or check plastics before entering our ecoPlant, reducing cost and increasing production of the ultra-clean fuel.
The ecoPlant creates enough power to power itself. There is no incineration process, meaning negligible emissions in production; It really is an ECO plant! 


The ThermoCatalytic Pyrolysis process does not burn/incinerate plastic. It is a clean & green ecologically friendly process that turns non-recyclable waste-plastic into ultra-clean fuel

 
 ⭐ When you say 'almost any plastic'...
...We really mean it! Today's recycling plants cannot take 90% of all plastic produced. Worse, if the 10% of the remaining 'good-plastic' isn't clean (or if it is contaminated with stuff such as food) it also has to be sent to landfill, be incinerated or shipped abroad (which can end up in our oceans). 
✅ There are 7 different types of plastic, this ecoPlant can take them all! 
 

 
✅ This includes: 

Plastic packaging, agricultural film, food and beverage containers. Single use & non-recyclable
Even including types of plastic that have high oil yield: PP, PS, LDPE, HDPE 
Some plastic contaminated? Metal slipped in? No problem. The ecoPlant can still work with up to 10% non-plastics in every load. 

 
...And what comes out the other end? 
IN goes non-recyclable waste-plastic... OUT comes: 

 
⭐ How will this help clean the planet? 
 

 
The ULTRA-clean fuel produced can be used in all today's commercial and residential vehicles and machinery. This means businesses can switch overnight to a cleaner solution.
And businesses will switch because:


The world wants to be greener - This provides business who rely on significant amount of dirty-fuel usage to make an immediate positive impact to their carbon footprint.  

There's strong demand for it - The UK renewables and waste-to-energy market is set to reach £425bn by 2020. Together we can move people to ultra-clean energy. 

Government-backed Initiative - Governments worldwide continue to invest in the green government- backed renewables energy sector,.

Proven Ground-breaking Technology - The waste-to-energy & clean-fuel market is here to stay. It's commercially tested and  solves two global problems at once. 

⭐ The Impact of the ecoPlant ⭐
 
We've designed the ecoPlants to have real impact, just see below: 


 
⭐ Where are we today? 

We're a small team (Andrew, Adel, Marina, Fernando, and Bertie) who are power-plant, energy, commodities and business professionals.  Between us, over the last 20 years we've built dozens of industrial plants around the world, and traded billions of dollars in commodities - we know the space. 
We also have the leading professional in this recycling process, as a founding member of this project. Andrew holds a PHD (doctorate), which was directly focussed on the processes of making non-recyclable waste plastic into ultra-clean fuel. 
In 2008 Andrew was the senior member on the team that designed and built a pilot-plant of this technology in Spain, which still runs today!
It's been a long journey. Over the last 10 years the ThermoCatalytic Pyrolysis technology has improved, which means we are now ready to launch our latest and newest plant which we believe can change the world.
We have bundles experience - the experience to build and run the equipment, plus all the technology, patents & processes ready to go. 
We now need your support and backing to complete the final due-diligence and 3rd party tests which will enable us to unlock the full funding to launch the plant. 
 
⭐ How we'll use the backing: 

As we mentioned earlier, it costs money to save our planet, which is the main reason humans just aren't doing it. It also costs money to build a CPE ecoPlant.
The fundraising from this crowd-fund is being used to complete the core Due-Diligence which is required to unlock the next £10M - the full cost to build the ecoPlant
✔️ The initial crowd-fund will be used to complete: 

Pre-Permits Application Discussion (PAD) with Municipal Councils and Environmental Agency
Finalize equipment agreements with technology providers (we are building some of the tech ourselves plus will use third-party tech)
Secure lease of site. (we have chosen 3 candidate sites at the time of writing)
Finalise feedstock agreements with local counsels (who are overrun with plastic)
Finalise Off taker agreements with (the people/companies that will use our fuel).
Project Development Contract with EPC 
Final project funding which will allow us to complete the ecoPlant.

We commit to update you on our process every 6-8 weeks (and answer as many of your questions in between).
What about over funding? If we are lucky enough to get the support that takes us beyond our goal, we'll continue looking for support to help build more and more ecoPlants. 

The team out and about in the midst of the #ClimateChange protests in London (April 2019)
 
⭐ Risks & Challenges

Between the lead members of the team (Andrew, Adel, Marina, Fernando, and Bertie) we've been fortunate to have had the experience of building over dozens of industrial plants over the last 20 years, trading $billions of commodities, running energy companies and successful businesses. We believe this experience puts this crowd-fund project in good hands.
However, no matter how much experience, the project does hold some risks. Here they are and how we are going to mitigate them: 


Risk 1: Competition: there are no plants like ours in the UK yet (the location of the first plant). Whilst we're confident the world has space for many ecoPlants from both ourselves and competitors, we need to make sure the feedstock (waste-plastic) is available in the local area we're going to build them. 

Risk 2: The price of fuel might fall, diminishing our ability to invest and run the plant economically. However, as long as oil is above $25 per barrel the ecoPlant can run. ( $25 is a very low number, it’s over double that amount now and was 5 times that amount 4 years ago)

Risk 3: Power outages, fires, other hazards. We have insurance that covers all that, but we need to take extra care to make sure the ecoPlant is built to the highest standards 

Risk 4: Our DD is not successful . There is always a chance there are key areas of the DD which are not successful and we may have a delay in unlocking the full funding we have agreed in principle. Should this be the case we believe the crowd-fund has enough contingency to mitigate and sort these issues, but until the DD is complete it is unknown. Over the last 18 months we have done everything we can to prepare for this crowd-fund.

<p>Most fertilizer company stories are simple; they burning fossil fuels using the Haber-Bosch process and generate 3% of the world's carbon emissions, in order to produce your favorite plant foods.</p>
<p><strong>Our story at Algas Organics, is quite different.</strong></p>
<p>Since 2011, increasingly severe influxes of Sargassum seaweed continually affect St. Lucia (our home base) and 18 other Caribbean territories. This invasive species floats in and complete inundates the coast, as seen above, for up to 8 months of the year, resulting in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mass killings of marine life, including turtles.</li>
<li>Exposure of thousands of coastal residents to high concentrations of hydrogen sulfide, emitted by decomposing Sargassum seaweed, posing a serious health threat. </li>
</ul>
<p>St. Lucia and other affected islands depend heavily on tourism. Imagine paying $3,000 for that Caribbean get away and arriving on beaches looking like this. Would you come back? Exactly.</p>
<p>Algas Organics was founded in 2014, by then 21 year old entrepreneur Johanan Dujon, with the vision to solve this problem, by creating a line of world class, organic, bio-fertilizers from Sargassum seaweed.</p>
<p>Johanan developed a proprietary, energy neutral process, after 12 months of extensive experimentation. Through this process, Algas Organics has successfully created a system which:</p>
<p>1. Keeps beaches clean by harvesting Sargassum seaweed.</p>
<p>2. Rather than dumping seaweed in a landfill, converts it into organic fertilizer for export.</p>
<p>3. Empowers women and youth in affected communities, through employment opportunities in the collection and processing  of Sargassum seaweed.</p>
<p>To date, the company has processed over 3 million pounds of Sargassum into its flagship product, the Algas Total Plant Tonic for export to the Caribbean region.</p>
<p>With your support, we will scale up our impact, create additional jobs and supply every corner of the globe with high quality, cost effective,bio-fertilizer.</p>

<p>Using seaweed as fertilizer isn't new. It's been done for hundreds of years and even today.</p>
<p>Although marketed under different brands, 99% of seaweed fertilizers available today, are made from Ascophyllum Nodosom, a cold water species which grows in Norway, Ireland, UK and the eastern coast of Canada. If you've used one, you've used all.</p>
<p>In other words, <strong>you need an UPGRADE.</strong></p>
<p>The Total Plant Tonic is derived from  a totally different and superior, Sargassum Natans and Fluitans species, from the Caribbean. This unique seaweed in combination with our patent-pending, energy neutral extraction technology, put our product in a league of its own. Naturally occurring growth hormones and amino acids are extracted in an eco-friendly manner, maintaining their molecular integrity. This provides plants with the highest quality nutrition.</p>

Powered by Innovation & Mother Nature, Not Fossil Fuels.

 
Most fertilizer company stories are simple; they burning fossil fuels using the Haber-Bosch process and generate 3% of the world's carbon emissions, in order to produce your favorite plant foods.
Our story at Algas Organics, is quite different.
Since 2011, increasingly severe influxes of Sargassum seaweed continually affect St. Lucia (our home base) and 18 other Caribbean territories. This invasive species floats in and complete inundates the coast, as seen above, for up to 8 months of the year, resulting in:

Mass killings of marine life, including turtles.
Exposure of thousands of coastal residents to high concentrations of hydrogen sulfide, emitted by decomposing Sargassum seaweed, posing a serious health threat. 

St. Lucia and other affected islands depend heavily on tourism. Imagine paying $3,000 for that Caribbean get away and arriving on beaches looking like this. Would you come back? Exactly.
Algas Organics was founded in 2014, by then 21 year old entrepreneur Johanan Dujon, with the vision to solve this problem, by creating a line of world class, organic, bio-fertilizers from Sargassum seaweed.
Johanan developed a proprietary, energy neutral process, after 12 months of extensive experimentation. Through this process, Algas Organics has successfully created a system which:
1. Keeps beaches clean by harvesting Sargassum seaweed.
2. Rather than dumping seaweed in a landfill, converts it into organic fertilizer for export.
3. Empowers women and youth in affected communities, through employment opportunities in the collection and processing  of Sargassum seaweed.
To date, the company has processed over 3 million pounds of Sargassum into its flagship product, the Algas Total Plant Tonic for export to the Caribbean region.
With your support, we will scale up our impact, create additional jobs and supply every corner of the globe with high quality, cost effective,bio-fertilizer.
In A League Of Our Own.

Using seaweed as fertilizer isn't new. It's been done for hundreds of years and even today.
Although marketed under different brands, 99% of seaweed fertilizers available today, are made from Ascophyllum Nodosom, a cold water species which grows in Norway, Ireland, UK and the eastern coast of Canada. If you've used one, you've used all.
In other words, you need an UPGRADE.
The Total Plant Tonic is derived from  a totally different and superior, Sargassum Natans and Fluitans species, from the Caribbean. This unique seaweed in combination with our patent-pending, energy neutral extraction technology, put our product in a league of its own. Naturally occurring growth hormones and amino acids are extracted in an eco-friendly manner, maintaining their molecular integrity. This provides plants with the highest quality nutrition.
 
World Class. Unparalleled.

 
The secret to healthier plants, more flowers and more fruits, is in your roots ! 
Algas Total Plant Tonic stimulates the exact root system your plants need to thrive in their unique soil and growing conditions. Talk about precision agriculture !
A better root system allows your plants to absorb more water and nutrients, for optimum growth.
Are your plants stunted? Does your garden look neglected? Have a plant that isn't flowering or bearing fruit? Or just want to make your neighbours, fellow farmers, gardeners, landscapers jealous? Use Algas !
Roots Galore =

 
Results You Can See, Every Time, On Any Plant.

<h2>My Project</h2>
<p>Recently, I was working on an unrelated project, and needed to create a power generator or engine with some serious oomph. My research brought me to various model engines like gasoline airplane, Stirling, and steam engines. All of them were off the shelf and hard to build or scale. Also, those engines’ designs were old, and the only ones available were cheap imitations or antiques that needed restoration.</p>
<p>Then, I noticed some early models of 3D printed air power engines. I started building them from publicly available plans and nothing worked. Before I knew it, I was deeply involved with designing various models for myself that were finally operational.</p>
<p>Now, a few months later, I have several very nice engines and many prototypes that I am giving away to my friends. This hobby is so much fun that I decided to share my designs with the world.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Currently, I have four working models and am developing several new engines. My plan is to raise enough funds to buy ten 3D printers and start production in early December, before the campaign is over. This way, I can start delivering rewards before New Year. That is why it is very important to get funding early.</p>
<p>We need about $5000 to pay for printers and materials to get started delivering our unique engines to you.</p>
<p>We have four working engines for you to choose you. Also we are giving away keychain engines to first twenty backers for free.</p>
<p>Currently we reserved our ten early prototypes that will be offered with personalized certificate of authenticity as another pirk.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact </h3>
<p>The successful funding will validate the project and the direction of idea. Without interest in project the company will die and project will be abandoned due to lack of support. I fully realize that there is a possibility that my fine engines are not as exciting or interesting to the public and I would stop designing. Hopefully that is not the case and we will witness birth of new company that will bring joy and happiness to many families.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Designing air powered engines is challenging and time consuming and sometimes can be frustrating.  The design and improvements of each engine model can take anywhere from a week to months. Yet we are far enough in our development that can take the next step and start limited production run. The current challenge we face is small production run capability limited to one engine a day. The good news is that most of our engine parts are 3D printed and we can rapidly scale the production by investing into more 3D printers. When project is successfully funded, we will have enough capability to produce ten engines a day and can meet our initial build quantity before Year end.</p>
<p>It will be very stressful at the beginning working with small number of printers and building everything from the garage.<br/>In case we have large number of orders, we will be able to move into commercial building and start larger production run without any major issues. The main challenge would be the funding and number of 3D printers we utilize.</p>

With the science of aeroponics, nutrient-rich water is delivered directly to the roots of your plants, all whilst using 95% less water and encouraging substantial growth.It's a low-maintenance, self-watering solution to growing plants and produce through urban agriculture! aTree already uses less water than traditional farming methods but also grows everything 3x faster and up to 20-30% larger! So, if you think that is nifty, just wait... aTree is also a close-looped, zero-waste system! It brings natural light and fresh air to any environment whilst empowering people to embrace nature and give back to our world!""We need to start thinking about the Future of Food if we are going to feed 9 billion people in a way that does not destroy our environment."" - Bill Gates First, let us explain WHY we’re doing this. Food is one of the most important elements in our lives. We all crave it, we all need it, but right now our world is facing some serious issues because of it. Not only that, we're also facing issues with the environment, as well as our health. Even for well-informed people, it’s sometimes difficult, even impossible, to know exactly where it is our food is coming from, how it’s handled, or even what’s added to it. Food scarcity is a huge problem, especially in our cities, where many households with children don’t even know where their next meal is coming from! In just 33 years, we're expected to be home to 33% more people on Earth. That's an additional 2.2 billion mouths to feed! As of now, 50% of our world's trees are gone, and by 2030, we may have only 10% of our natural rainforests left due to deforestation. In the past 40 years, Earth has lost a third of its arable land due to erosion and pollution. We are destroying our own home before our very eyes.Demands for food are beginning to increase, access to land is beginning to decrease, and we're running out of time.We're reaching a tipping point. Technology makes growing food in urban environments, in spaces once deemed 'unusable' very simple and possible. And while we do face a serious crisis, there is a solution - aTree. But, we must act now, bold and united, to create an independent food system that helps us, as well as the world. We can no longer rely on politicians and corporations - we can grow our own food! aTree harnesses the miracle of aeroponic technology, but more on that later... Nutrient-rich water is delivered directly to your plants' root structures. One notable aspect about aTree is the practical foot pump we've added to the base of the unit. Water rains down through aTree's trunk, wetting your plants' root structures with the help of a gravity-fed drip method, in turn, promoting sufficient, healthy plant growth!By using the foot pump at the base of the unit, water and oxygen travel back up the trunk, through the process of aeration, until it comes back down through again. This healthy cycle helps your plants develop faster, and without the risks of, A, overwatering, and B, developing root rot!In soil, plants' roots have to dig through and search for their nutrients, be at the mercy of insects and weeds and soil-borne diseases, as well as battle against other roots for its sustenance, all while attempting to gather energy from the sun to grow from above. With aTree, your plants' roots are placed in their own specific space, protected from all of those other nasties, where they're free to grow as long and wild as they wish. Since the nutrients are delivered directly to them, they don't have to spend energy searching for them. And with that energy saved, guess where it goes? You guessed it, it goes towards... GROWING! UP! You don't need any previous growing experience. It's that simple!Plant SeedlingsThere are 30 trunk spaces along aTree's trunk for plants to be added. Refill WeeklyTop aTree up with nutrient-rich water when needed. Depending on the plants, aTree will need around 20 litres a week. Pump DailyPumping aTree for at least 1-2 minutes a day will ensure optimal water flow for plants. HarvestWhen ready, pull the plants from their net pots and enjoy the fruits and veg of your labour. (Tip: leave the roots connected so that your plants stay alive longer)  Now, what is aeroponics, you ask? Aeroponics is a subset of hydroponics - a method of growing plants without soil.

These hang branches hang from the corners of aTree so that they do not interfere with the care, or the admiration, of your beautiful plants! Growing in any condition has never been so easy!
 
It was important to us to not only design functional grow lights for the home, but to ensure that we were providing an energy efficient solution. With these LED hang branches, we can almost argue that growing food at home is more economical than heading out to the grocery store!
 
Designed for your convenience, we've incorporated an inconspicuous storage space into aTree's treetop for things like your tools, seed packets, nutrient mix, husks, pots, scissors, testing kits, and other paraphernalia. Accompanied with germination trays to leave your seeds out to sprout, aTree comes with everything you'll need to get started AND finished!
 
 
 
 
           We have brought together a team of passionate, devoted individuals that are excited to undertake such a long and arduous journey to steer the future and create a better world. With a headstrong team, a plethora of wonderful partners bestowing guidance and aid, and a range of amazing supporters, we know we will achieve our goals!It's going to take a lot of time, a lot of work, and a lot of persistence, but it will be a journey worth it so that we can learn and grow and become a better, stronger team. One of our blessings is our team, working in perfect harmony, and that will be the backbone of us delivering on what we promise to our backers and supporters! Supporting us in this endeavour means you're voting for change. You're voting for your food to become a more sustainable food network, where communities can come together and share. These networks will decentralise control of our food supply in a manner that does not have a high cost on the Earth. That, and it will instead help us learn to grow, contribute, and come together again.The idea behind Applant is not only to grow but to change our consumption patterns and, ultimately, do more with less. This is all about empowering people to control their food needs, with a little guidance as required.We aim to be the conversation starter on how we can do things better, the reason people want to begin to change their communities and, more importantly, their own behaviours for the better. By providing seeds, nutrients, recipes, gardening tools and more, we can empower humanity to once again adopt a more community-based approach to farming - just how farming was originally intended when the revolution first began.  Prototype after prototype, we were obsessed with learning how we could grow plants better. We knew we could, so we went back to the drawing board and got to work and built aTree up to where it is today. We designed a vertical garden that flowed seamlessly, with an urban design, with easily integrated LED grow branches that could grow 30 plants at a time! While the unit itself is extremely simple to use, the technology behind it is far from simple.The material used to build aTree is polycarbonate. Where we have applied UV-stabilisers for aTree to withhold tough environments. We've engineered aTree to provide the ideal amount of nutrients and oxygen for plants' root structures at all times.  At Applant, we have large, audacious goals...1. Vertical gardens for urban householdsPlanting aTree in urban households will set a trend for a new way to grow food and become self-sustainable. It will become the beginning of restoring our broken food system, as well as living healthier and smarter.2. Vertical gardens for urban community farmsWhile we understand that not everybody can afford an aTree unit, we wish to create urban community farms so that everybody can grow together, bringing people and resources together, strengthening our communities.3. Self-reliant food systems that operate on alternative energyBy creating an autonomous, self-reliant food system, we can alleviate the many burdens that prevent us from growing food locally. This can allow us, as a whole, to shift our attention towards other necessary tasks. It all begins with the tools, the resources, and the knowledge....by achieving these 3 goals, we believe a world of change could come about by growing food where we eat. By creating independent food systems, we can stand by our tribes, allowing wildlife to return to their natural states, save lives, create a greener world, and a greater future! We’ve designed aTree to stand up against the test of time. It’s a step above the average hydroponic system that generally uses styrofoam, non-food grade plastics, and other materials. Our plastic is top-of-the-line, food-grade plastic made from polycarbonate. It’s BPA-free, the best AGDA-approved plastic that money can buy!Will the plastic break down in the sun, you ask? If it did, it would break down as a result of leaching, not structural integrity, so we took every step to ensure that this does not happen. We’ve invested in double UV-stabilisers to protect the plastic from breaking down or leaching so aTree will last a lifetime. We’ve also gone above and beyond with opaque plastic, which helps keep your plants' root structures cooler, any algae accumulation at a minimal, a unit that reflects light back towards your plants, and keeps the inside-heating and breaking levels down.   We're a team of enthusiastic visionaries that see a world where people aren't denied access to food... a world where our environment can thrive as we do... a world where communities are brought together for a noble cause......a world that is possible with aTree.By sowing the seeds of change today, we can reap the rewards of a grander future not just for us but for the future generations. We can be remembered as the generation that changed the way food was cultivated and eaten.By growing today, we can secure a greater tomorrow and safeguard the future - but we can only do it together.Let's start growing up together.Thank you. Risks and challengesWe stand for value, quality, and growth, but we'd like to move forward with an air of transparency also. Applant has a team with extensive manufacturing experience and involvement.PROJECT BENEFITSWe've got a history of designing and manufacturing quality products in-house. That being said, we're proud to announce that aTree is the result of considerably detailed planning. To get the ball rolling, we've previously designed and manufactured the aTree garden.Despite our expertise and careful planning, there will always be risks to the project. We’ve identified and outlined the following key risks to our project below:INJECTION MOULDINGInjection moulding is the process that can often set hardware projects back. We’re fortunate to have experience in injection moulding, but in the event that there is a problem with the injection moulding process, our project could be set back several weeks.EXCESSIVE DEMANDShould we receive support in excess of our anticipated demand, there could be delays in backers receiving their products.If demand is extraordinary, we could be forced to open a new manufacturing facility, which could further delay our project.SUPPLY CHAINWe have long-standing relationships with our suppliers. In addition, we have a very robust supply chain for components. However, it is not impossible that our project could get delayed due to problems with a supplier. Questions about Indiegogo?

<h3>About the project</h3>
<p>We are Tai Chow Sing and Siwar Amri , and we are based in Lyon, France.</p>
<p> Since 2011, we have been developing a new type of wind turbine to address the shortfalls which prevent more people from harnessing wind power. It is our belief that more people deserve to tap into the abundant natural kinetic energy which spontaneously envelops them, yet evades their grasp. Unlike stable sources of sustainable energy such as solar and biomass, the mostly ephemeral nature of wind and its unpredictable availability presents an additional challenge to the adoption of wind power. To address this problem, the central tenet of the design was for the wind turbine to be a vertical axis configuration, able to deliver a usable amount of power in erratic and turbulent wind conditions, and placing it in a niche apart from the more common horizontal axis wind turbines which require 'clean' airflow in specific locations to operate properly.</p>
<p>Drawing from experience gained from large bespoke outdoor installation projects, the design is focused on simplicity and ruggedness, capable of being installed and mantained in the widest of environmental conditions, and with minimal support.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1469278613/rboppz9phtilul4zq1ae.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>61813 bearing in DN80 pipe</i></p>
<p>Proven methods and materials from a range of different industries are combined in a novel way to ensure a consistent and trouble-free construction process and to provide reliable operation, in line with our vision of doing good in the world through increasing quality, be it of our products or of the lives of people.</p>
<p>The design is centered on the novel 5-phase, counter rotating electrical generator, first proven in 2013: <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/carmatic/videos/vb.502061196/10151695758021197"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.facebook.com/carmatic/videos/vb.502...</a> . A major decision was for a magnetic bearing effect to be implemented in the design, where the vertical load from the weight of the wind turbine is not borne by a mechanical rotating joint, and that the same magnets which induce the alternating current in the electrical generator also be utilized for this purpose. This contactless movement bypasses the problems of a traditional thrust bearing joint such as the requirement for lubrication and the associated vulnerability to damage from foreign objects and weathering, loss of efficiency from friction, and noise. Furthermore, by combining structural and electrical functions to the same magnets, the entire wind turbine is reduced to 2 moving parts, lowering the bill of materials and the cost of upkeep.  We have the capability to engineer the electric generator-bearing to a high degree of confidence and quality through the use of finite element analysis: </p>

<p> </p>
<p>The implementation of electronics into the rotor sections allows them to become smart aerodynamic elements. Currently, as a persistence of vision display, the installed electronics are digitally-controlled LED's, but future developments will use similarly installed solenoids and sensors which can actuate and sense the position of a flexible control surface, unlocking new levels of digitally-controlled wind energy capture potential.</p>
<p>We have also an ongoing project with Jambo Charity in Nairobi, Kenya to provide free wind-powered electricity to the surrounding community: <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1469279733/f2ncyk8sb3ilcqvkxb92.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>These wind turbines are built with materials and expertise sourced locally.</p>
<p>We are looking to collaborate with more charity organizations all over the world.</p>
<p>In these early versions of the wind turbine, the electrical generator-bearing is configured such that the heavier weight of the rotor is supported at the cost of the power output, which was sufficient to charge a mobile phone. The Savonius rotor is utilizes aerodynamic drag to produce rotation, thus limiting its rotation speed and the amount of power it can produce.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get </h3>
<h3>The new design:</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1469320824/lugpipnxedrkvxboxr40.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We are currently developing a new and more powerful wind turbine based on a Darrieus rotor as can be seen in the main video, and this confers a number of advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>The light weight allows the electrical generator-bearing to be biased towards generating more electricity, increasing efficiency and reducing cost.</li>
<li>The Darrieus airfoils are based on principles of aerodynamic lift, as opposed to the crude aerodynamic drag of the Savonius turbine. This translates into a more efficient conversion of air speed into rotor movement, and the Darrieus airfoils travel faster than the wind, even in the direction away from the wind. The increased rate of rotation also increases the mechanical to electrical conversion efficiency of the electrical generator.</li>
</ul>
<p>An inherent disadvantage of the Darrieus design is that the airfoils require a narrow range of angles at which they are exposed to the wind in order for the lift effect , and hence the rotation of the rotor, to occur. If the airfoils were made to be simple and straight, they would leave gaps in the wind direction in which the turbine will fail to spin. This issue is rectified geometrically by fashioning the airfoils into helical shapes, resulting in a complete coverage of angles at which the aerodynamic lift effect would occur. However, achieving this shape requires specific construction methods which are not commonly used for creating simpler shapes. We have devised a simple way of creating such helical shapes : By using flexible materials, we can combine a bend and a twist to form a helical shape, and by making it conform to a 3D printed and CNC machined bending jig, we can achieve a precisely correct helix. The materials are then encased in fiberglass which gives the final structure, while the internal tension of the flexible materials will counteract centrifugal forces during high rates rotation, enhancing the strength and safety of the design.</p>
<p>Our first wind turbine of this new design will be built YouFactory in Lyon, France. <a href=""http://youfactory.co/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://youfactory.co/</a> because the maker space allows us to access rapid prototyping machines and tools, accelerating the development processes and rectifying mistakes in a productive manner. YouFactory also provides technical expertise assistance and a space for testing new methods, making it vital for the progress and innovation of the project as a whole.</p>
<p>The completed wind turbine will be exhibited as an art installation in Boom Festival <a href=""http://www.boomfestival.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.boomfestival.org</a> , making use of its implementation as a persistence of vision display in a decorative context. We believe that this is the most appropriate step in this stage of development, for a number of reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is an opportunity to raise awareness of the wind turbine project, expanding our business influence and increasing our outreach.</li>
<li>The festival has an emphasis on renewable energy and has been developed according to sustainable principles, thus it is a suitable model for the installation and usage of the wind turbine in a more realistic context.</li>
<li>Various aspects of the wind turbine, such as the aerodynamic properties, have not been refined, and the non-critical nature of the festival is an ideal incubating environment for the wind turbine. </li>
</ul>
<p>The bill of materials for this wind turbine can be viewed on this online spreadsheet: <a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17lMk__sI2EpcYO5qhKvxFPdrGotGDwTWmbP3rSi6ApY"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17lMk__s...</a></p>

<p>Eco-panels – one of the solutions used during the construction of houses. What is it? Eco-panels are straw based panels. A pressed straw (the density of which is 140kg/m³) is laid into a wooden frame which is impregnated with antibacterial substances. Both sides of the frame are concealed with a layer of clay plaster. As a result, a lightweight and reliable block is obtained that is designed to hold 27 tons of vertical load and has high thermal insulation properties. Another positive aspect of the material is that houses can be constructed in various climatic zones, including seismic hazard zones.

<p>Why Soleco House? Our houses have a number of advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Energy-efficiency. The pressed straw has low thermal conductivity. Houses constructed from this material require five times less energy for heating in winter and cooling in summer, than houses built from ordinary materials. For example, if the house has an area of  100m², then it consumes only 1500 kW of energy per year.</li>
<li>Strength. The estimated vertical load of 27 tons makes it possible for the panels to reliably support the ceiling and roof and withstand extreme loads during earthquakes.</li>
<li>Durability. We can guarantee selected high-quality natural materials, the estimation of blocks and their production in strict accordance with the technology. The houses built by Soleco House will serve for five generations.</li>
<li>Ecological compatibility. Straw is an environmentally friendly material.

<p>1. Is the house suitable for year-round living? Maybe this is an option only for a garden house?</p>
<p>This house is much warmer than a house built from traditional materials. Straw is a very warm material. Furthermore, in an ordinary home there is a constant decrease of heat due to ventilation.

<p>2. Yes, but will this „breathing” cause chill and drafts in the house?</p>
<p>No, it is immpossible. Due to the fibrous structure of the straw all gas exchange processes take place at a molecular level. There will not be chill and draft in the eco-cube itself.

<p>3. Straw is easily flammable. Will the house be safe?</p>
<p>The dense pressed straw prevents oxygen from getting inside the unit. Also, the fire resistance of the block is increased by clay plaster.

We are two german volunteers living in the south-western region of the DR in a little village called „La Descubierta“. Our job is bringing light to myriad houses where electricity is a rare good. How we achieve this: Our organisation „Litro de Luz RD“ or „Liter of Light RD“ is constructing and installing sustainable solar lamps which are already giving many families in different places of the DR the advantage to have their houses illuminated even when the light on the street is gone. Besides that giving environmental classes, including workshops on how to produce those solar lamps is another major part of the work they are accomplishing. La Descubierta : La Descubierta is a small village in one of the hottest and driest region of the country. There are living around 5 thousand people a lot of haitian people as well because of the close distance to the border. La Descubierta is surrounded by mountains where people are living in even smaller villages to work on agriculture farms. Most of those villages including „La Descubierta“ are connected to the power system of the country nevertheless having electricity all day long almost never happen. Normally the light comes for a few hours at afternoon and than passes by at night. When the light goes the fridge no longer works, the fan no longer works, but even worse the houses are getting pretty dark. The other villages more on the way up the mountains are not even connected to the power system. Some Families have a thing called: „Inversor“.

We are two german volunteers living in the south-western region of the DR in a little village called „La Descubierta“. Our job is bringing light to myriad houses where electricity is a rare good. How we achieve this: Our organisation „Litro de Luz RD“ or „Liter of Light RD“ is constructing and installing sustainable solar lamps which are already giving many families in different places of the DR the advantage to have their houses illuminated even when the light on the street is gone. Besides that giving environmental classes, including workshops on how to produce those solar lamps is another major part of the work they are accomplishing. La Descubierta : La Descubierta is a small village in one of the hottest and driest region of the country. There are living around 5 thousand people a lot of haitian people as well because of the close distance to the border. La Descubierta is surrounded by mountains where people are living in even smaller villages to work on agriculture farms. Most of those villages including „La Descubierta“ are connected to the power system of the country nevertheless having electricity all day long almost never happen. Normally the light comes for a few hours at afternoon and than passes by at night. When the light goes the fridge no longer works, the fan no longer works, but even worse the houses are getting pretty dark. The other villages more on the way up the mountains are not even connected to the power system. Some Families have a thing called: „Inversor“. Its a block of car batteries which can store a lot of energy but only when the light isn‘t gone. It costs about 140 US $ which most families can never effort. Flashlights are a lot cheaper but buying batteries every month can get expensive as well. Candles and gas lights have the same problems. So there come our lamps into play! Litro de Luz RD actually builds three different kinds of solar lamps: The “Litro de Luz Noche“ is the most popular one which is directly installed into the roof of the house and gets charged by a solar panel automatically during daytime. The “Litro de Luz Calle“ is a street light which illuminate streets automatically when the sunset sets in.

<p>We look forward to spending set up time in Portugal with the local community furthering those supportive relationships and giving this project the time it deserves to develop successfully. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Further information</strong></p>
<p>Some of the most accomplished UK trainers will be part of this project and glad to have the opportunity to work through winter months.  These are professional trainers with passion &amp; expertise, teaching theory and practise of eco-building, bringing skills, pride and hope to young people and families.</p>
</div>
<p>Automation of industry and commerce is allowing people to have more time, though possibly less money. This creates the opportunity to consider self-building your own home. Sharing this profound experience with family and friends makes lasting bonds, communities and strengthens relationships. </p>
<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>I'm Ann Gylman, I studied English Literature, I set up the first walk in pregnancy testing clinic in UK, in Leicester, so women could have an immediate result and privacy.</p>
<p>I worked in property management for some years until I founded my own property management company, which I sold to move to Brighton. It is still thriving today.</p>
<p>I've managed, refurbished and restored properties in the UK and in France. I trained in eco self-building with Brighton Permaculture Trust and I'm heading this project to transform the housing market. To create awareness of the benefits of self-building and to make it a mainstream choice.    </p>
<p>Housing costs are a person's biggest regular outgoing, either mortgage or rent.  Young people are finding it increasingly difficult or impossible to finance, they don’t know how they’re going to pay for a home in the future. BUT, job automation, means less money BUT more time.</p>
<p>Bringing self-building into the mainstream as a valid choice, saves many thousands of pounds in costs and interest payments.</p>
<p>The great Mark Twain said, “Buy land, they’re not making it anymore.”</p>
<p>Ones own home, built with love!!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Impact </strong></p>
<p>Our expectation is that we can be a viable business in 2 years.</p>
<p>A woman said recently she was out of work but wanted to contribute.  I asked her if she could give £1, she said yes, but was it worth it? We agreed it was and she would ask her friends to put in £1. She promised to send £10, and she did. We really appreciate that she did this and kickstarted this campaign. Please know that we value and appreciate every gesture of support.</p>
<p>Another woman sent  £1,000. </p>
<p>Sponsors for this project are aware that changes are needed in the housing market.</p>
<p>UK statistics show prior to CV19 that 180 people daily were being evicted from their home.</p>
<p>Every contribution brings us closer to supporting people to self-build secure homes, youngsters, parents and grandparents are a powerful group financially and energetically.</p>
<p>The cost of eco self-building is affordable, without excessive mortgage debt.</p>
<p>Our intention is to bring ecological self-building into the mainstream, giving people purpose and choice. </p>
<p>Our contributors will be celebrated, remembered and  known for their foresight and generosity.</p>
<p>Heroes are the pioneers of this new paradigm - the researchers, the developers, the contributors to life that works for everyone. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>CONCLUSION ~</strong><br/>Self and community building of sustainable eco-homes is perhaps the next bubble. </p>
<p>We promise to give information and trainings on how to build safe, long-lasting buildings in a community based on fellowship, humanity, teamwork, self-reliance and pride. </p>
<p>I’m imagining people with strong family values, philanthropists who are aware of social problems, and who are seeing a bigger picture.  They are adventurous, open to both old and new ideas for affordable, sustainable freehold, family housing, wanting old fashioned family values reinstated.</p>

Making self-building a mainstream choice!
PATÉ (Pure, Absolute, Totally, Eco) is a new business with a mission to train young people self-building eco-homes which are affordable, lasting and environmentally friendly.
Self-building is about building cheaply in an environmentally friendly way. Designing buildings that are sustainable from the outset, finding solutions, making the building sector fit for the future.
Our current project is setting up a teaching centre in Portugal  where weather allows all year trainings. In the UK we work from April to October as its outdoors work. 
This training centre is where youngsters of all ages will carry out projects with appropriate, reusable materials such as earth, straw, wood and tyres. Learning skills for a quality of life which they may think is beyond their reach.
 This new paradigm is going back to history, learning how to build a future that nourishes Earth and family life. Bringing self-building into the mainstream.
Our sponsors will know the value of peaceful coexistence with Earth balancing human life with natural resources and considering other species.
Purpose of this project
We intend trailblazing the homes market  with tested, life altering trainings, using traditional eco-building methods, old fashioned values, new possibilities for family life.   
Self and community building of affordable eco-homes, just may be the next bubble.

Budget notes,
Any funds over this amount will facilitate online presentations to create awareness and excitement around the concept of what is possible for them in the area of eco-self building. During this period when people are looking for new opportunities, we offer a vision for a brighter future.
Beyond £25,000 funds will be used as a reserve fund, for marketing and towards the courses and extending the land.
We look forward to going to colleges with introductory talks.

Website building, expanding the team, developing relationships with colleges, the media and customers,, as well as online introductions and teaching.
We look forward to spending set up time in Portugal with the local community furthering those supportive relationships and giving this project the time it deserves to develop successfully. 
 
Further information
Some of the most accomplished UK trainers will be part of this project and glad to have the opportunity to work through winter months.  These are professional trainers with passion & expertise, teaching theory and practise of eco-building, bringing skills, pride and hope to young people and families.

Automation of industry and commerce is allowing people to have more time, though possibly less money. This creates the opportunity to consider self-building your own home. Sharing this profound experience with family and friends makes lasting bonds, communities and strengthens relationships. 
Background
I'm Ann Gylman, I studied English Literature, I set up the first walk in pregnancy testing clinic in UK, in Leicester, so women could have an immediate result and privacy.
I worked in property management for some years until I founded my own property management company, which I sold to move to Brighton. It is still thriving today.
I've managed, refurbished and restored properties in the UK and in France. I trained in eco self-building with Brighton Permaculture Trust and I'm heading this project to transform the housing market. To create awareness of the benefits of self-building and to make it a mainstream choice.    
Housing costs are a person's biggest regular outgoing, either mortgage or rent.  Young people are finding it increasingly difficult or impossible to finance, they don’t know how they’re going to pay for a home in the future. BUT, job automation, means less money BUT more time.
Bringing self-building into the mainstream as a valid choice, saves many thousands of pounds in costs and interest payments.
The great Mark Twain said, “Buy land, they’re not making it anymore.”
Ones own home, built with love!!
 
Impact 
Our expectation is that we can be a viable business in 2 years.
A woman said recently she was out of work but wanted to contribute.  I asked her if she could give £1, she said yes, but was it worth it? We agreed it was and she would ask her friends to put in £1. She promised to send £10, and she did. We really appreciate that she did this and kickstarted this campaign. Please know that we value and appreciate every gesture of support.
Another woman sent  £1,000. 
Sponsors for this project are aware that changes are needed in the housing market.
UK statistics show prior to CV19 that 180 people daily were being evicted from their home.
Every contribution brings us closer to supporting people to self-build secure homes, youngsters, parents and grandparents are a powerful group financially and energetically.
The cost of eco self-building is affordable, without excessive mortgage debt.
Our intention is to bring ecological self-building into the mainstream, giving people purpose and choice. 
Our contributors will be celebrated, remembered and  known for their foresight and generosity.
Heroes are the pioneers of this new paradigm - the researchers, the developers, the contributors to life that works for everyone. 
 
CONCLUSION ~Self and community building of sustainable eco-homes is perhaps the next bubble. 
We promise to give information and trainings on how to build safe, long-lasting buildings in a community based on fellowship, humanity, teamwork, self-reliance and pride. 
I’m imagining people with strong family values, philanthropists who are aware of social problems, and who are seeing a bigger picture.  They are adventurous, open to both old and new ideas for affordable, sustainable freehold, family housing, wanting old fashioned family values reinstated.

In gratitude, Ann 
 
Risks & Challenges
If we raise less than the full amount we will continue campaigning.
We'll prepare as much as possible during the pandemic, knowing we are preparing information and putting plans in place for those who want to learn more about self-building 
My daughter said, ""When this is over, everyone will be running for the hills to self-build""

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The world is switching from fossil fuels to renewable energy. In 2016, investment in new power capacity of renewable energy exceeded fossil fuel. Paris Agreement, which 195 countries signed, aims for zero emissions by 2050. This can be achieved with full replacement of fossil fuels by renewables.</p>
<p>However renewable energy sources are unreliable and their output tends to be volatile, going up and down sharply, with change of wind speed and sun light loss by cloud cover. Utility scale Energy Storage provides the critical ability to stabilise the volatile renewable output.</p>
<p>Pumped Hydro has traditionally provided the lowest cost energy storage, well below Li-ion battery, compressed air, molten salt and others. However Pumped Hydro sites, which can provide low cost energy storage, are close to 100% exploited in the developed countries and fast getting used up in the rest of the world. While Pumped Hydro is still possible, developing the sites now available requires much higher cost, so major expansions of Pumped Hydro  to support full replacement of fossil fuels by Renewable energy are not possible.</p>
<p>The solution Solid Pumped Hydro( SPH ) is a innovative twist on the 80 year old proven Pumped Hydro technology. It is closely related to Pumped Hydro and uses very similar equipment.  SPH overcomes the stringent geographic specifications of Pumped Hydro sites, making available a massive number of new low cost sites at convenient locations.</p>
<p>Convenient locations that are close to the grid, require lower costs of connecting the Energy Storage site to the grid. This can be a significant part of the project cost.  SPH projects do not require dams and as a result require a lower degree of civil construction and tunnelling, compared to Pumped Hydro. Dams and tunnelling are a major part of the cost of Pumped Hydro projects.</p>
<p>So Solid Pumped Hydro is a disruptive change, that could  accelerate the process of wind and solar renewable energy sources completely replacing fossil fuels like coal, petroleum and natural gas.</p>
<p>Solid Pumped Hydro(SPH) is a highly scalable solution to the energy storage problem. SPH is possible to roll out with existing materials, resources and manufacturing capability. Almost all the equipment can be ordered off the catalogues of industrial equipment manufacturers.</p>
<p>In 2017 the leading contender of energy storage was Li-ion battery. How ever Li-ion has a long way to go in developing the installed capacity, to be able to support the full replacement of fossil fuels by renewables. Li-ion requires massive investments (in the order of 500Billion USD) to build a 100 Li-ion factories that are bigger than the biggest factory in the world in 2016. The battery, equipment cost and installation cost is extra. The current  generation of battery have a specified life rating of 10 years. This means a recurring expense in battery replacement every 10 years.</p>
<p>The SPH concept is simple, but needs a quick validation with prototype plant and commercial demonstration site before it is massively rolled out. Existing industrial plants can supply the pumps, turbines, motors, electrical equipment and construction materials,</p>
<p>SPH is a practical, winning potential solution which can help restrict global warming to 2 deg C well before 2050.</p>
<p>You have a crucial role to play in funding an accelerated validation and trials of SPH to allow it to spread rapidly and start de-carbonising the energy industry withing 5 years.</p>
<ul>
<li>I am an engineer,MBA,PhD,Inventor and a teacher. I have an track record of solving hard problems.  I visualise solutions and lead teams with multidisciplinary expertise into delivering sustainable winning solutions.</li>
<li>The SPH concept is simple yet innovative and powerful. It has been presented to and vetted by several engineers from Mechanical, Process and other disciplines. No showstoppers were found.</li>
<li>This campaign will provide seed capital to develop and demonstrate the solid pumped hydro technology as a scalable solution to Energy Storage.</li>
<li>Your contribution will provide the bias for action, in that the seed capital raised from you will be leveraged to access both state and federal Govt grants.</li>
<li>The project should receive 1:1 or even 1:2 subsidies and grants, based on out initial interaction with govt funding agencies. The SPH technology meets 100% of the grant criteria by supporting renewables expansion, low environmental footprint, non polluting and potentially lowest cost/MWH.</li>
<li>Based on the amount of funding raised a prototype project will be setup. </li>
<li>Even the prototype will be income positive in daily operation, based on the daily difference  between wholesale peak and off peak rates. Difference in these rates can vary in the range of $40 to $80 per MWH from day to day.  So a 200MWH site can earn between $2.9 million and $5.8 million per year, on top of supplying the critical ability to stabilise the renewable output.</li>
<li>An agreement will be sought with Wind farm / Solar PV farm(s) to buy unsold power which is lost, at cheaper than offpeak prices. At present as unsold wind power or solar PV is never stored and is completely lost.</li>
<li>There is also a possibility to contract ongoing sale of the stored energy direct to a utility / Govt or to a large power consuming entity like a large factory or a city council.</li>
<li>Your contribution is critical to start the snowball rolling downhill. Once in motion the successful project will gathers more support on its own and should become a positive planet changing avalanche</li>
</ul>
<p>Like you, I too love our planet unconditionally. To use a cliche ""its the only one we got"" and we are at the tipping point of global warming. The solution is stop burning fossil fuels NOW and prevent the associated CO2 release. The sooner we do it lower will the the loss of bio diversity, which is our common priceless heritage and lower will be the damaging economic and social impacts of global warming induced climate change.</p>
<p>I have a solution but need your collective help and goodwill to make it happen for our common good.</p>
<p>Wind and Solar have the ability to replace fossil fuels, but can do so only if backed up by reliable energy storage. At present we rely on fossil fuels like gas to support volatility in renewables. If fossil fuel is removed, the role of energy storage becomes  even more critical. In a decarbonised future, every solar PV or wind farm will need to come with its own or contracted storage capacity to the tune of  25 to 50% of its capacity.</p>
<p>I have the plan to create  easily deployable massively scalable energy storage with a small environmental footprint, using Solid Pumped Hydro(SPH). This can happen at the level of utility company or community based facilities or at the smallest level to include individual farm or factory level facilities.</p>
<p>Being grid connected, any excess storage capacity can be offered to other reneewable energy producers or even utilities and a profit can be extracted from the difference between offpeak and peak energy rates. But more importantly SPH can provide insurance against catastrophic statewide power failure events like what occured in South Australia in Feb 2017.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>We are raising $10 million USD by this campaign. We expect to attract government subsidies and grants between 10 to 20 million USD. With this and if necessary some bank loans we aim to setup a 30MW Solid Pumped Storage facility with 4 hours storage. Providing 120MWH energy storage.</li>
<li>If this project succeeds every one that contributes to will be given a piece of the equipment from the first prototype when it is retired on a commemorative plaque. The people that donate to this campaign are special they will also receive within 2 months a personalised certificate( as a pdf file to save cost)</li>
<li>If the raised capital is less than the target 10million USD, we have the ability to scale down the prototype project to the size of the combined total of the funds raised in this campaign and the matching 1:1 grants and other subsidies that become available.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The impact of this project is critical. At present there in only one easy to deploy scalable solution in energy storage and this is Li-ion Battery Farm technology. The SPH project offers a practical alternative with a delivery time frame of 1 to 2 years.</p>
<ul>
<li>SPH technology can save the world literally. We need to de-carbonise the energy industry to limit climate change to 2 deg C warming. This project can be the catalyst to  Wind and Solar PV to massively expand to replace coal and gas power plants.</li>
<li>As an engineer I have a successful track record of 2 decades in making innovative modifications to large processes to achieve major energy and material savings. I have never failed in an energy saving or process optimisation project.</li>
<li>The Team already includes a mix of young and experienced design, operations and project engineers with a combined experience of 100 man years and spans continents.</li>
<li>Most good ideas are simple like the light bulb, and they change the world. This one can not only change but will probably save the world. </li>
<li>Don't sit on the fence, instead take ownership of the solution, make a contribution no matter how small and watch the project evolve with pride. Spread the message in your sphere of influence and your contact list. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We have two challenges. The first is to raise enough seed capital to be able to access the 1:1 grants and subsidies that this project easily qualifies for. The second is to quickly construct and commission the commercial Energy Storage facility size demo and keep it running as a cash positive venture. A 30MW / 120MWH capability is  the size being aimed for. This is similar to the  size of the Li-ion battery farm being built in South Australia by the largest battery company in the world.</p>
<ul>
<li>We have a team of highly experienced engineers onboard already. Who are already addressing the design and other technical issues including environmental Impact.</li>
<li>We have already made contact with government arms and renewable energy funding agencies and have received an encouraging response and guidance. We are therefore now focusing on raising the seed capital through this campaign.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:</p>

<h2>What is an InnerG Bus?</h2>
<p>An <strong>InnerG Bus</strong> is a school bus that has been renovated into a home on wheels built to reflect you. An InnerG Bus is built for the occupancy of up to 5 residents with accommodations that include personal sleeping space and storage.<span style='letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'> InnerG Bus residents are also equipped with<i>, a shared bathroom, shared kitchen, additional storage, common area, light transportation, electricity, water, heat, A/C, appliances, WiFi and a community of people looking to collaborate and support each other</i> - <u>all for just $399/mo</u>. </span></p>
<p>Our mission is to empower people to create the life that they desire, by building the most affordable &amp; self-sustainable homes in the world, retrofitted with everything you need to live the life you want! What we mean by retrofitted is that an InnerG Bus can be built out to be a mobile <i>Restaurant, Photography Studio, Music Studio, Work Space, Barbershop, and the list goes on.</i></p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Poverty - the inspiration!</h2>
<p>Huffington Post recently wrote an article titled <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/how-much-you-need-for-rent_us_5942cc92e4b0f15cd5b9e2ee"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The Hourly Income Needed to Afford Rent Around The U.S.""</a> - the article's main point is that in the U.S. majority of people's monthly job earnings ends up being less than the average cost of rent. This is the most significant cause of poverty. Life is too expensive for many people around the world. And it's not even the luxuries that are too expensive, it's the basic needs, the bare minimums, the food, clothes, housing &amp; transportation that's too expensive.</p>
<p>The purpose of InnerG Bus is to dissolve the suffering that these situations produce, by alleviating impoverished circumstances through self-sustainability. At it's root, InnerG Bus will provide affordable, creative and modern, housing that anyone can afford with a minimal amount of effort. <span style='letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>Our ultimate mission with InnerG is to enable people to spend their InnerG how they want.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Sweat Equity &amp; Personal Financing!</h2>
<p>The first bus was purchased in January 2017 and the team started working on it in late March 2017. The first prototype has been 75% completed in 90 days as a result of the full-time efforts of Latrell Garnett and Brodie Cross Jr. We purchased our own tools and hustled to find a feasible work space. And by far, we would not have made it this far without all of the people who have volunteered their time and knowledge to help us move forward - the electricians, the plumbers, the carpenters, the designers, the digital interns, and the extended community that was just looking to lend a hand.

An InnerG Bus is built for the occupancy of up to 5 residents with accommodations that include personal sleeping space and storage. InnerG Bus residents are also equipped with, a shared bathroom, shared kitchen, additional storage, common area, light transportation, electricity, water, heat, A/C, appliances, WiFi and a community of people looking to collaborate and support each other - all for just $399/mo. 
Our mission is to empower people to create the life that they desire, by building the most affordable & self-sustainable homes in the world, retrofitted with everything you need to live the life you want! What we mean by retrofitted is that an InnerG Bus can be built out to be a mobile Restaurant, Photography Studio, Music Studio, Work Space, Barbershop, and the list goes on.
 
Poverty - the inspiration!
Huffington Post recently wrote an article titled ""The Hourly Income Needed to Afford Rent Around The U.S."" - the article's main point is that in the U.S. majority of people's monthly job earnings ends up being less than the average cost of rent. This is the most significant cause of poverty. Life is too expensive for many people around the world. And it's not even the luxuries that are too expensive, it's the basic needs, the bare minimums, the food, clothes, housing & transportation that's too expensive.
The purpose of InnerG Bus is to dissolve the suffering that these situations produce, by alleviating impoverished circumstances through self-sustainability. At it's root, InnerG Bus will provide affordable, creative and modern, housing that anyone can afford with a minimal amount of effort. Our ultimate mission with InnerG is to enable people to spend their InnerG how they want.
 
Sweat Equity & Personal Financing!
The first bus was purchased in January 2017 and the team started working on it in late March 2017. The first prototype has been 75% completed in 90 days as a result of the full-time efforts of Latrell Garnett and Brodie Cross Jr. We purchased our own tools and hustled to find a feasible work space. And by far, we would not have made it this far without all of the people who have volunteered their time and knowledge to help us move forward - the electricians, the plumbers, the carpenters, the designers, the digital interns, and the extended community that was just looking to lend a hand. Thank You!!!!! :)
 

Interested in Early Access? 
If your answer is yes, then here's your opportunity. We are inviting anyone, anywhere to join the community. Just choose the Perk that best fits you and you'll be in your InnerG Bus by 2018.
 

What Your Support Means
Upon raising $50,000, we will be able to build 2 more InnerG Buses, allowing us to serve 100 people by the end of this year.  Artists, entrepreneurs, students, and people n general - will be able to be able to live without having to work so hard for money. An InnerG Bus Resident would only have to make $100/week to afford a place to sleep, utilities, amentities, transportation, and more. Imagine the type of life a person could live because they don't have to work so hard to live. Imagine being able to save so much more money from your pay check. Imagine having the time and energy to do more of what you want to do in life and not of what you have to do in life.
 
Other Ways You Can Help
Sharing is Caring :) We appreciate having a community of people providing feedback on our creativity. We share InnerG Bus' Design, Engineering & Community endeavors on...

<h3>Dear friends! Welcome! Lets make Healthy, Fresh air available to all! and much more!:)</h3>
<p>Hello  everyone! My  name  is  Paul  Blank  and  I  am  the  founder  of  the  unique  Phytensor brand  and  the  inventor  of  the  Emanator  bio  and  eco - friendly technology!</p>
<ul>
<li>I invented the technology when I was 12 years old together with my father who is a biochemist and has multiple patents and inventions to his name.</li>
<li>I  remember  looking  at  a  unique  device  he'd  created  in  2002  in  our  apartment  that's been  filled  with  dozens  of  Living  curative  plants  and  I  remember  asking what  purpose  it  served?( I  knew  plants  are  good  for  us, the  basics , some  clean  our  air,  some enrich it  and  all  are  vital  to  our  survival) My dad  told  me  that  when  these plants  are  together  they  sort  of  create  an  integral  field  of  energy  and  release  healing  elements  and  compounds  from  within  a  lot  faster  and  it is  more  potent.  Ive  watched the thing  for  hours,  while  my  father  tried  obtaining  THE ELIXIR OF LIFE AND YOUTH:)) it  was  literally 1  drop  an hour  for  this extract  to  happen  it  took about  a  week to  fill up  the smallest Pharma  style  bottle. We  didn't  even  know  what  to do  with  it:) however, it  did  smell  amazing. </li>
<li>This  is  when  Ive  noticed  how  right  before  a heavy  rainstorm  was  about  to  unveil  the  condensate started  flowing  a  lot  faster  for only  about 5  minutes or so, before  the rain hit  hard.  And then and there  I've  proposed to make  a bigger device filled  with  more  unique  plants  and enrich  water  with  the  airflow  from  these amazing  gifts of  Nature.</li>
<li>That was  just  the  beginning:)</li>
<li>It is  very  important  for  me  and  I think  for  all  of us!  to  support such  unique  and amazing projects  as  they  are  in  direct  benefit  to  us  all!</li>
<li>Unlike  any  other companies  out there. We  do  not  crush, steam,  cold- press and  harm plants  in  any way  to  obtain  essential- oils, antioxidants  and  other  healing ingredients  </li>
<li>On the  contrary,  this unique  process uses  variably  lowered  atmospheric  pressure(just like in Nature, before the Rain hits), special  lighting,  climate  controlled environment  to  carefully  stimulate  the  plants  of  choice to  release  1000's  of  times  more  effective  ingredients  for  us  to  enjoy!</li>

<p><strong>What is VACCARS?</strong></p>
<p>VACCARS - Vehicle Assist Carbon Capture Air Refresh System is the integration of using a clean energy source such as solar panels to operate air compressors that draws air past different types of filter systems.</p>
<p>The compressed air is then stored and then used for an air engine that drives the vehicles of the Hail Ride transport system. Passengers and clients pay for this transport, which in turn pays for the construction and operation of the system. This makes the system financially viable and scalable to a point of making a difference to air quality and the reduction of greenhouse gases.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Our Vision</strong></p>
<p>To provide a commercially viable solution to inner city transport in as many large cities across the world, with our revolutionary carbon negative system, which is a first of its kind.</p>
<p><i>“Time to Drive Change for the Environment”</i></p>
<p>VACCARS is designed on the principal of real change for the environment that we are all desperately seeking and need to combat global warming.</p>
<p>VACCARS was invented by Terry Garratt through research into Green Technologies as he was seeking to get a better understanding of what is happening to global climate change.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Opportunity</strong></p>
<p>The market opportunity lies in the urgent need in combating climate change without straining government and country finances.</p>
<p>High quality, low cost hail ride transport in the future has mass market appeal for the urban public, because there are no parking problems, no high up-front expense of purchasing a vehicle that includes no vehicle maintenance to worry about, no repairs to pay for, no need to worry about refilling, no need to get car insurance, no need to get the vehicle tested and no need to worry about emission tests.</p>
<p>Petrol vehicles are becoming more recognized as a threat to our environment, through fossil fuel combustion, releasing a high amount of Carbon Dioxide and other toxic gases into our atmosphere, worsening climate change and polluting our air. We are now in the start of a transition period for their replacement,</p>
<p><i>Health is a growing industry as more and more people are looking for healthier lifestyles. Bottled water, fitness centers and health foods are all growing industries, now is the time for healthy clean air.</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What We Need</strong></p>
<p>We are now asking for a small contribution from you to reach an initial $150,000 AUD to create a component working model of VACCARS.</p>
<p>This will provide us with proof of concept that will give us a key facts and figures of what this system can achieve and a platform to campaign for future funds so that we can create a full scale VACCARS Roadway to integrate all of the various components and have a fully functional system operational.</p>
<p>In return for your support, we will write a personalized letter back to you thanking you and as a show of good faith we will provide you with a top priority to access future investment into VACCARS at an initial discounted rate, for more details please feel free to contact us for more information and terms and conditions will apply.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hey everyone, my name is Lee. I have always had the desire to be a entrepreneur, so I am pursuing my dreams and started a lighter company. I have produced many different types of unique lighter products that fulfill just about any need you can think of. I saw a need that people had, I wanted to fix that need. So I came up with a solution, using electricity from an ion battery inside the lighter to get them hotter and more efficient. Not only do are these lighters hotter and more efficient but there are also ECO-friendly. Traditional lighters have a toxic gas called butane, which is bad for the environment. Sense my lighters use electricity there are no toxic gas particles being released. This putting an end to the frustration of having your flame burn out to quickly or burning yourself in the process all while doing my part in saving the environment. </p>
<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
</div><div>
<p>My goal is $10,000. Why such a high goal you may ask? Well I am looking to expand. I would love to get a small store front and educate more about the benefits of plasma lighters. </p>
<p>The best part is the Perks you will get for helping me fund this project! Discounts on the newest item that hasn't even be hit my website yet! So you get the opportunity to have the first lighter before it's released.</p>
<p>All funds that are brought in will go directly towards business expansion. I am so excited about this opportunity and I hope you will be too!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The environment and our health. With rapid population growth and a multi billion dollar industry (tobacco) constantly polluting the air. I am hoping that switching over to butane free lighters will cut back on the toxic gasses being released. Not only does butane affect the environment but it also has negative affects on health, which is another big reason why I am starting the push to have electric lighters in all stores. Even though cigarettes are bad for you, inhaling butane over your lifetime can speed up the process. All in all this is to help others health and help the environment with a new yet efficient lighter.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Starting a new business is never easy and for me finances keep me limited. I work hard for everything I have and I know with the right support behind me I can make a huge impact on not only the environment but also for others around me.</p>
<p>The risk is failing with this campaign.</p>
<p>Challenges, well challenges will always arise when owning a business. It is all about how you handle those challenges.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I know not everyone is interested in lighters, but anything helps even if you can share my campaign with others who may be interested. </p>
<p>Thank you so much for everything because sometimes it takes people like you to make others dreams come true!</p>

Starting a new business is never easy and for me finances keep me limited. I work hard for everything I have and I know with the right support behind me I can make a huge impact on not only the environment but also for others around me.
The risk is failing with this campaign.
Challenges, well challenges will always arise when owning a business. It is all about how you handle those challenges.

Other Ways You Can Help
I know not everyone is interested in lighters, but anything helps even if you can share my campaign with others who may be interested. 
Thank you so much for everything because sometimes it takes people like you to make others dreams come true!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

America’s struggle with COVID-19, racial tensions, and political and economic turmoil have moved us to action. We propose to raise $5 million to build a mixed-income affordable housing complex in New York City, using our unique construction and technology skills.Homes will be move-in ready within just hours of shipping, with a cost per square foot far less than half that of traditional brick-and-mortar construction. The icing on the cake will be a large LED memorial stretching across the roof, dedicated to victims of COVID-19 as well as those medical, police, and other professionals in service of the country during its time of crisis.Today, Americans are falling behind on mortgage and rent payments. The numbers have risen and many are alarmingly close to the edge. More than 300,000 people have fled New York City and up to 40 million Americans are facing eviction. This has not only to do with land speculation and the housing supply, but also with the high cost and risks of new construction.Tomorrow’s cities in America, China, and all over the world are going to need to think differently about housing, affordability, and the way we run cities. We’ve always questioned the cost of housing construction and living costs. We believe that one way to reduce costs and risks is to develop efficient, consistent, durable construction modules that can be erected with much less effort, perhaps even easily relocated when the need arises. With the various risks reduced, people can live where and how they want to live, not forced to choose housing based primarily on the land value and income ratio.With your help, our short-term goal for early 2021 is to build this 9-story, 18-apartment mixed-income development in the New York metro area. Each unit will be 1,453 square feet, providing comfortable two-bedroom apartments for dozens of New Yorkers. Total square footage will be about 29,063 square feet.The long-term goal for Broad 5D is to give people more housing and relocation possibilities at a lower cost, so that they can reboot their careers and rebuild their hopes for the future. We believe our technology can be applied wherever people are seeking more sustainable housing and construction solutions. Only two years old, Broad Digital is the young subsidiary of a much larger company. Broad Group Ltd. (broad.com), in operation since 1988, made its name constructing massive air purification systems for the world’s largest buildings and airports. Zhang Yue, our founder, won the coveted United Nations ""Champion of The Earth"" award in 2011 for his environmental leadership. In 2014, Fortune named him one of the World's Top 25 Eco-Innovators.Our sister company, Broad Sustainable Building  (BSB), develops our innovative modular housing. There are a number of large-scale modular housing options, but none as fully developed or as rapid. We made WIRED and worldwide headlines when we built a 57-story modular office building in just 19 days. This past April, we built a fully compliant COVID hospital in Korea in three days. And it's just been announced that we are to help RCS Sport build a planned Playscraper ""tennis tower"" in Italy.We are Broad Digital, building the high technology and imaginative vision behind Broad. Broad Digital is a team of 30 smart architects, designers, writers, video directors, marketers, IoT programmers, VR/AR developers, and support staff. We even have rocket scientists (really!): our own Jay Jiang went to Hainan Island in November to serve as announcer for the launch of China’s Chang’e moonshot. In the proposed design by architect Len He, the entire structure is lifted by thin stainless steel columns, giving the appearance of floating aloft from a distance. We will also dock a large LED art display on the community rooftop. This is to create a memorial space for the lives we have lost because of COVID-19, as well as to convey respect and appreciation for the medical workers and other personnel dedicating their efforts to fighting COVID-19.The underside of the roof is an LED matrix, while the upper side is a solar panel to supply the energy required by the LED. This forms an exhibition space and a common area for community activities and relaxation high above the city.Under the roof, of course, is a Broad 5D building, assembled with our state-of-the-art prefabricated building modules. All the structure and interior decoration are currently produced at our assembly plants in Hunan Province. Our unique automated assisted processes allow unprecedented production rates. At present, our facility has the capacity to produce one 646-square-foot building module every minute. These modules can be assembled and stacked much like Lego blocks, each unit able to be unfolded and move-in ready in just a couple of hours.Our team will customize the program of LED display The current plan is to provide color indications of current air quality and other indicators (call it a ""mood roof""). On weekends, the roof will change to the form of a sea world, in memory of the heroes and victims of COVID-19. The design can be changed periodically, according to the season or community preference.Rendering of an air-quality indication design for the rooftop LED display.Rendering of a sea-world design for heroes and victims of COVID-19.BCore, the outer shell of Broad’s 5D modules, was inspired by aerospace hull technology. Lightweight stainless-steel panels are tied together by a network of tubular struts, sandwiching a thick layer of rockwool insulation. After nine years of exhaustive iteration, we have a product that is as strong as concrete, but much lighter, longer lasting, more insulative, and far more sustainable.We have spent the last year fine-tuning 5D's manufacturing processes. We are now exercising our Yueyang assembly plant, stockpiling ready 5D housing modules at a rate of between 30 and 50 per day, although current full capacity is several times this speed. We are now breaking ground for four new domestic housing developments, and also setting up additional assembly lines. Finally, we have ambitious plans for sharing this technology worldwide, to realize even greater efficiencies.These units come pre-equipped with owner-specified bath and kitchen fixtures, as well as other amenities and interior designs, even some start-up furniture if desired.

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>Greetings!  We're here to show you our research for you to affordably get a near real-time warning of a wildfire in your area, or any area for that matter.  There's no doubt that the technology we're showing you is better than or equal to what's out there right now for immediately alerting neighborhoods, whole cities, fire fighters, and forest management professionals of a wildfire in near real-time, and thus almost certainly providing a better chance at saving lives, property, forests and grasslands.  The difference is, our system is inexpensive and can be deployed by anyone.  You could even cover all of Tongass National Forest, or as small as your city park, local forest, or prairie for a fraction of what those big systems cost.  Consider it a back-up to what's out there, or just another layer of security. </p>
<p>If you've ever lost everything you own to a fire, except literally the shirt on your back, as I and my family have, you know that you're thankful to be alive, but you feel the agony of remembering what you lost and cherished so much--your family pictures, the toys of your children, the house you and your spouse worked so hard to get, perhaps even your pet, and so on.  You wouldn't wish such a horrible fate on anyone, and in fact, just the opposite: you'd want to wish for them an early warning before a wildfire destroyed everything.</p>
<p>What we are asking for here is your help in continuing our efforts to develop this <strong>affordable</strong> wildfire detection technology--an inexpensive sensor that can be deployed in forests or grasslands.  Our current research has developed sensors which communicate with their neighbor sensors via radio signal in <strong>one big mesh network</strong>, with the data from all sensors going to a central Coordinator which sends data back via WiFi or cell phone SIM to a Web site and to YOU if a wildfire is near you.  Our plans are to extend the range of the sensors (currently 0.5 to 1.0 miles, or more, depending on terrain), finish development of the solar-powered Controller, develop satellite capabilities for even the deepest forests or jungles that are nowhere near cell phones or the Internet (e.g., the deep jungles of Borneo), continue development of infrared and sound detection, development of the database and graphing capabilities, neural network, machine learning, and other artificial intelligence techniques, as well as many other capabilities that will make Wildfire Watch the most comprehensive little, <strong>affordable</strong> wildfire detection system in the world.</p>
<p>Data recorded through time will develop trends and show when your area begins heating up sooner than expected and can allow you to prioritize and allocate resources to areas you think are more prone to the ignition and spread of a wildfire.</p>
<p>With Wildfire Watch sensors, you don't have to wait to hear about it from the evening news, a neighbor banging on your door, or God forbid, the horrible sound of a fire approaching your house.  The alert goes directly to our Web site, but also to your phone as a text, an email address, or even to your Apple Watch or Fitbit.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1555881276/x7kjv80mbzwkhntcd8s8.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The colored icons are shown here on an example Real-Time Map page, which depicts an illustration of how a real fire in the eastern Everglades might look, with the user clicking on one of the red icons:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1555881481/remfmmdhfonaiaqrskqh.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The data read-out shows that sensor #2006, detected a wildfire or 45.5 degrees Centigrade on December 12, 2018 at 7:08:52pm local time, or 12:08:52am GMT.  Again, this was not a real fire, but our sensors have been deployed in test situations and do in fact report exactly as shown in the automated texts and on our online map.</p>
<p>Our mesh sensor network works, but we need that extra push to manufacture more sensors, develop the back-end database to depict real-time graphs of the progress of temperatures, and add our next exciting line of communication:  satellite transmission from anywhere on the globe.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need and What you Get</strong></p>
<p>We have developed and tested our wildfire sensor prototype in the real world--in Colorado and in Florida.  It works!  What we need, though, is funding to continue the manufacturing of the thousands of these sensors that we know can help save lives and property, and to make sure we have the legal groundwork necessary to go to market.  We have the necessary patent applied for (Application Number 62698112), but we need to finalize that application with the Patent and Trademark Office by July, 2019; and we need to have an attorney provide proper disclaimers and other proper documents for our new S Corporation, Wildfire Watch, Inc. (EIN 83-0721334).  What's required:</p>
<p>$8,000 for legal fees</p>
<p>$12,000 to begin manufacturing hundreds to thousands of the sensors</p>
<p>If we don't reach our goal of $20,000, we will still press forward and deliver on our perks, as promised, anyway--it will just take longer.</p>
<p>If we are so fortunate as to gain more than we are requesting, those funds will go to building more sensors and more advertising and thus saving more people, property, forests and grasslands. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1565096417/cefyv00gabqmwk5xnw61.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>Every sensor our contributors and users deploy helps to provide yet another early warning sentinel of a wildfire.  It may be a back-up to already existing wildfire monitoring technology, or a stand-alone wildfire monitoring network.  Maybe you don't have a spare $50K or $1M to deploy systems that are already out there.</p>
<p>The more fires that are detected and extinguished, the more people, property, forests and grasslands are saved.  Even if a system is in place where you live, Wildfire Watch adds a level of warning and security in quicker time than you may already have.  Talk to your City Council and see what <u>they</u> think!</p>
<p>A benefit you may not have thought of is also accrued:  the reduction of greenhouse gases that warm our planet, and which, in a vicious circle, make wildfires even more likely to start.  Not only are you helping to stop wildfires, <i>you are also helping to reduce climate change!</i>  Have you ever felt totally powerless to do anything about climate change?  <i>That no longer is the case! </i> With every Wildfire Watch sensor you purchase, you are helping to reverse climate change.</p>
<p>Our goal is to provide you the earliest possible indication of a wildfire, so that your neighborhood can be protected as soon as possible.  Even if there are other detection methods available or currently operating, a Wildfire Watch Network in your neighborhood adds one more level of early warning and protection.</p>

<p><strong>Risks and Challenges</strong></p>
<p>We are a small group with advisors--scientists, engineers, and entrepreneurs--who have studied environmental monitoring for many years, and who in one case has had experience with deploying many sensors in the field.  We know our stuff, and we guarantee you these sensors will work as deployed according to instructions.  <i>However</i>, there is no guarantee these sensors can save your life or your property; rather, they offer an added layer of security and early warning to an oncoming wildfire.</p>
<p>Although <i>we can not make a guarantee of saving lives and property</i>, we can certainly guarantee that our sensor technology works, and we have put two years into the development of this technology to reach those goals.</p>

What we are asking for here is your help in continuing our efforts to develop this affordable wildfire detection technology--an inexpensive sensor that can be deployed in forests or grasslands.  Our current research has developed sensors which communicate with their neighbor sensors via radio signal in one big mesh network, with the data from all sensors going to a central Coordinator which sends data back via WiFi or cell phone SIM to a Web site and to YOU if a wildfire is near you.  Our plans are to extend the range of the sensors (currently 0.5 to 1.0 miles, or more, depending on terrain), finish development of the solar-powered Controller, develop satellite capabilities for even the deepest forests or jungles that are nowhere near cell phones or the Internet (e.g., the deep jungles of Borneo), continue development of infrared and sound detection, development of the database and graphing capabilities, neural network, machine learning, and other artificial intelligence techniques, as well as many other capabilities that will make Wildfire Watch the most comprehensive little, affordable wildfire detection system in the world.
Data recorded through time will develop trends and show when your area begins heating up sooner than expected and can allow you to prioritize and allocate resources to areas you think are more prone to the ignition and spread of a wildfire.
With Wildfire Watch sensors, you don't have to wait to hear about it from the evening news, a neighbor banging on your door, or God forbid, the horrible sound of a fire approaching your house.  The alert goes directly to our Web site, but also to your phone as a text, an email address, or even to your Apple Watch or Fitbit.

The colored icons are shown here on an example Real-Time Map page, which depicts an illustration of how a real fire in the eastern Everglades might look, with the user clicking on one of the red icons:

The data read-out shows that sensor #2006, detected a wildfire or 45.5 degrees Centigrade on December 12, 2018 at 7:08:52pm local time, or 12:08:52am GMT.  Again, this was not a real fire, but our sensors have been deployed in test situations and do in fact report exactly as shown in the automated texts and on our online map.
Our mesh sensor network works, but we need that extra push to manufacture more sensors, develop the back-end database to depict real-time graphs of the progress of temperatures, and add our next exciting line of communication:  satellite transmission from anywhere on the globe.
What We Need and What you Get
We have developed and tested our wildfire sensor prototype in the real world--in Colorado and in Florida.  It works!  What we need, though, is funding to continue the manufacturing of the thousands of these sensors that we know can help save lives and property, and to make sure we have the legal groundwork necessary to go to market.  We have the necessary patent applied for (Application Number 62698112), but we need to finalize that application with the Patent and Trademark Office by July, 2019; and we need to have an attorney provide proper disclaimers and other proper documents for our new S Corporation, Wildfire Watch, Inc. (EIN 83-0721334).  What's required:
$8,000 for legal fees
$12,000 to begin manufacturing hundreds to thousands of the sensors
If we don't reach our goal of $20,000, we will still press forward and deliver on our perks, as promised, anyway--it will just take longer.
If we are so fortunate as to gain more than we are requesting, those funds will go to building more sensors and more advertising and thus saving more people, property, forests and grasslands. 

The Impact
Every sensor our contributors and users deploy helps to provide yet another early warning sentinel of a wildfire.  It may be a back-up to already existing wildfire monitoring technology, or a stand-alone wildfire monitoring network.  Maybe you don't have a spare $50K or $1M to deploy systems that are already out there.
The more fires that are detected and extinguished, the more people, property, forests and grasslands are saved.  Even if a system is in place where you live, Wildfire Watch adds a level of warning and security in quicker time than you may already have.  Talk to your City Council and see what they think!
A benefit you may not have thought of is also accrued:  the reduction of greenhouse gases that warm our planet, and which, in a vicious circle, make wildfires even more likely to start.  Not only are you helping to stop wildfires, you are also helping to reduce climate change!  Have you ever felt totally powerless to do anything about climate change?  That no longer is the case!  With every Wildfire Watch sensor you purchase, you are helping to reverse climate change.
Our goal is to provide you the earliest possible indication of a wildfire, so that your neighborhood can be protected as soon as possible.  Even if there are other detection methods available or currently operating, a Wildfire Watch Network in your neighborhood adds one more level of early warning and protection.

Risks and Challenges
We are a small group with advisors--scientists, engineers, and entrepreneurs--who have studied environmental monitoring for many years, and who in one case has had experience with deploying many sensors in the field.  We know our stuff, and we guarantee you these sensors will work as deployed according to instructions.  However, there is no guarantee these sensors can save your life or your property; rather, they offer an added layer of security and early warning to an oncoming wildfire.
Although we can not make a guarantee of saving lives and property, we can certainly guarantee that our sensor technology works, and we have put two years into the development of this technology to reach those goals.

WHAT ABOUT OTHER APPLIANCES?


CAN EVEN POWER YOUR OFF-GRID COMMS
We integrated the latest in long range off-grid wireless technologies. Perfect for outdoor adventures, but also critical for emergency situations like blackouts or natural disasters. The Omni Connect Module comes with 4 Omni Connect devices and can be used INDEPENDENTLY from the Omni Off-Grid Station.


A CONNECTIVITY SOLUTION THAT'S READY FOR ANY SITUATION
Voice and text messages transmitted through Omni Connect use a new communication standard called LoRa. This allows you to send and receive messages using extraordinarily little power at very long range. You can read more about LoRa HERE.

IT'S YOUR OWN PRIVATE NETWORK
Omni Connect doesn't require any 4g, wifi, or cloud; it's your own private communication channel. Perfect for off-grid camping or emergencies when the grid is down.

EXPAND YOUR NETWORK'S REACH WITH OTHERS IN THE COMMUNITY
For each Omni Connect device in use, the range of the community mesh expands. All devices operate on the same frequency, so everyone within range can act as relays for others.

SECURELY COMMUNICATE WITH YOUR FAMILY AND FRIENDS
Your smartphone handles the encryption and decryption using 128 bit AES and the devices it relays through can't decrypt the message.


CONTROL EVERYTHING THROUGH OUR MOBILE APP
The Omnicharge mobile app provides an intuitive interface that allows you to interact with your Omni Off-Grid and Omni Connect. It also allows you to manage off-grid channels, track locations, and privately message your family and friends.

FAQ
General
 Will COVID affect the campaign? So far COVID-19 has had zero impact on production. Our overseas production facility is working in full force. We don't foresee any delays due to the coronavirus. Will the production models be exactly like the ones pictured? No. We have a few tweaks to make and reserve the right to make modifications. We've already made some upgrades based on feedback from thousands of backers. Is there a warranty? Yes! We use high-quality components and are in this for the long run. If you need any support at all you can reach our support team by email. All Omnicharge products are protected by a one year warranty. How much does it weigh? The Omni Off-Grid is both lighter and smaller than competition with similar capacity. In the current configuration, It weighs in at around 37lbs. Can I take the Omni Off-Grid on a plane? No. Under FAA regulations you are not allowed to take any battery exceeding 100Wh on a plane. How frequently do I need to use or charge the device? We recommend that you recharge the Omni Off-Grid at least once every six months. If user charges to 100%, unit can be placed in storage for 1 year in normal temperature environment. Is there any water resistance? Very light rain and other similar amounts of water won't affect the Omni, but be sure not to expose to heavy rain or water for safety reasons.Technical
 Will you also offer a 230V model? Yes we will be supporting a 230V model with an international AC plug version of the Omni Off-Grid. Just select your perk, and you can choose the option you want shipped to you. Is the solar charge controller mode MPPT or PWM? We've incorporated an MPPT controller in both the Omni Off-Grid and Omni Extended Battery solar input ports. Can I use a third party solar panel and what conditions need to be met? Yes, you can. However, it must meet Open Circuit Voltage: 12-60V/Max.10A, Max.400W. Can you recharge with Solar panel and the Wall Socket simultaneously? Yes, you can, the total maximum input is 800W which recharges the Omni Off-Grid in 3 hours. Does the Omni Off-Grid use a pure sine wave AC inverter? Yes, all AC outlets on the Omni Off-Grid use pure sine wave inverters so you can safely power any equipment or appliance. Can you charge and discharge the Omni Off-Grid simultaneously? Yes, it supports pass through charging for both AC and DC loads. This means you charge the power station while simultaneously outputting power as well. How fast can you charge it to 100%? It takes about 3 hours to charge to 100% with 800W total input from solar + ac wall charging. What is the surge power of the Omni Off-Grid? It can reach up to 3000W surge. Is the DC 12v regulated? Yes, it is.Omni Connect
 How are the messages transmitted? The messages and walkie talkie are transmitted through a new communication standard called LoRA. LoRA is a long range low power communication standard, that allows you to send and receive messages using extraordinarily little power at very long range. You can read more about LoRA HERE. What is the range of Omni Connect? The range of Omni connect can vary greatly depending on the terrain you are operating in. If you are operating indoors in a big city, your range could be as low as 500m, but if you are in open terrain in the countryside you could get up to 3km for voice or up to 8km for text. What LoRA frequency do you use? We operate at sub gHz bandwidth around 800-900mHz. How is my communication secured? The encryption and decryption is handled on your smartphone using 128bit AES. Can messages relay through people I don't know? Yes, your encrypted message can be relayed via other omni connect users; letting you expand your coverage through the Omni Community. The encryption and decryption is handled on your smartphone and cannot be decrypted by people it is relaying through. Can a Omni connect device act as a relay if it's not paired with a smartphone? Yes it can. The logic for transmitting a message is done on a hardware level, and the smartphone is only there to decrypt the message. This means that you can set up Omni Connect devices independently, and they can still act as relays. How many times can a message be relayed? Messages can be relayed up to 7 times. Can I use the Omni Connect module independently? Yes, the connect docking module has a separate USB-C charging port for use away from the Omni Off-Grid Power Station.

<p>It is not always possible nor healthy to use air conditioners on a daily basis. The high energy consumption makes it a comfortable accessory but an excessive use can cause discomfort, such as headache, stiff neck, back pain and respiratory problems. And that goes for the use of fans: by mobilizing the air, you can feel a sense of coolness but, in the meantime, you are stimulating sweat and increasing the risk of dehydration. </p>

Geizeer is patented and manufactured in Italy
Geizeer was born from the necessity to make our work environment more comfortable, at a cost of 1 cent per day.
       
It is not always possible nor healthy to use air conditioners on a daily basis. The high energy consumption makes it a comfortable accessory but an excessive use can cause discomfort, such as headache, stiff neck, back pain and respiratory problems. And that goes for the use of fans: by mobilizing the air, you can feel a sense of coolness but, in the meantime, you are stimulating sweat and increasing the risk of dehydration. 
 



 Working, studying, sleeping, watching TV or enjoying a meal can be difficult during the hot sunny days as a consequence.​ Hence the idea of Geizeer, a  personal eco- friendly ice cooling with refrigerant mixtures, which consumes less than 1 cent per day!
 

 Geizeer is made of wood, a perfect thermal insulator. Externally it is composed of two wooden shells and metal finishing frames. Internally it contains a rechargeable battery, a micro USB port with PCBs, a DC brushless fan, an ice pack and a black insulating pads to protect the wooden structure.

 
The two halves of the  cube, the upper one and the bottom, form a cube when you overlap them, graced by a metal frame. On two of the four wooden legs there are electrical contacts that allow the operation of the fan. The lower half has an isolated space for a rechargeable battery and a PCB with micro USB port. Above this space, the cooling elements has to be entered. In the upper half   a brushless fan is enclosed . The fan draws hot air from the upper grid which forces a loss within the cube. After a few seconds in contact with the ice pack, the cool air is pushed out 360 ° from the cracks that divide in half Geizeer. Geizeer comes from micro-USB to USB cable.
  Once we had the idea of ​​starting a Geizeer, the design process began by developing the study of form, an essential step to refine this design in a short time. The first drawings were made on paper, and then transformed into three-dimensional models using CAD programs. 
 
For the first prototypes, a 3D printer FDM (Fused Deposition Modeling) was used. This allows you to have, in a short time, various forms of different sizes, giving us the opportunity to do the efficiency test. From here we have selected and worked on the most functional form, refining the design. 
 

During the second phase of prototyping a CNC pantograph was used to obtain the prototypes as similar as possible for a display speech of the product, conceived to make the most of the efficiency and functioning with wood test.


 
In the third phase, Geizeer was finished and colored by the expert hands of Italian craftsmen.
 


 

  In the last phase, the electrical and decorative components have been mounted.
 

 
 
Geizeer's use is very simple. You just have to enter the cooling elements, previously frozen in the freezer, into bottom of the cube. And then, overlap the upper half of the cube on the bottom by aligning the two dots of each half.

 
  
In that position, the contacts come together, the electrical circuit is closed, and the fan works. To turn it off, you just have to raise the upper half and rotate it.
That’s right. There are no ignition keys!

We have studied this method of ignition to make Geizeer as safe as possible, even in the presence of children or animals.
 
In fact, the fan will run only if the cube is closed !
 
The fan draws hot air from the upper grid which forces a loss within the cube.
After a few seconds in contact with the ice pack, the cool air is pushed out 360 ° from the cracks that divide in half Geizeer.

 


 
The ice pack is also equipped with a concave space where you can insert perfume that will make environment fragrant.    
 
The small size of the Geizeer makes it portable and can be used in any environment.The corners are rounded, the electrical components are concealed in the specific spaces , the metal frames attach perfectly to the wood and the ice pack acts as a cone-shaped diffuser in order to make the escape of air easier, increasing the flow and range. In this way, it prevents an overheating of indoor air, due to the mechanical rotation of the blades.  
 
Using Geizeer for 24 hours, the power consuption will be about 1 cent. The cooling element, previously frozen, is sealed and it contains a mixture of gels. It has a duration of about 4 hours before melting and it can be reused.
  
 The electrical components of Geizeer are retractable into the wood and the ignition is given by the contact of 4 metal feet that, depending on the placement of the two halves of the cube, turn on or off the circuit. The Li-Po battery lasts around 3 to 5 hours, depending on the selected speed level of the fan, and it is charged via micro-USB cable. 
Geizeer provides for a micro-USB cable with a logo that turns red when battery is charging, and it turns blu when battery is fully charged.
     
  
The cold air is pushed out at 360 ° from the slots which divide in half the cube to a diameter of about 1.20m. This system allows the refreshment of the entire area around Geizeer, unlike other unidirectional ventilation systems (for example some people sitting around a table). The brushless DC fan is powered at 12V and it has a life span of over 160,000 hours.
 
 

 The wood has exceptional thermal characteristics, in fact, is a microscopic material that absorbs moisture easily, in addition to being a perfect thermal insulator.
 
  
Given its low conductivity and thermal capacity, the inside of Geizeer will stay cold and isolated from the external environment heat. It allows a good energy saving and longer life of an ice pack.
 
   
 
 Geizeer is available with 2 different grids , designed by parametric equations: Linear and Parametric. (the difference is only in the design)
 
 
 


 Geizeer is available in different colors: Natural and Lacquer.

Risks and challenges
 
During the design phase we came in contact with suppliers to obtain quotes and production time.Parties requesting more time for production are the mold for the ice pack and the wooden shells.We will start the production of the mold as soon as the goal is exceeded so as to fall in line with delivery.For wood production we are already in contact with several work centers that provide us with a production lot more than the number of pieces for the achievement of the goal.If the campaign far exceeds our expectations we will move to look for other suppliers. The challenge of the project is to receive a quantity of orders higher than expected, but we are taking precautions by contacting multiple vendors.",52.0,2,"7 Campaigns

We also aim to make a difference for other species.Our solar lights are used to help with conservation and the 24-hour protection of native, and endangered animals.              Choose between cool and warm light settings.                   The conveniently small and sleek shape makes Occa the perfect travel buddy and a backpack must-have.        Help the planet by reducing waste and toxic chemicals from disposable batteries.Inbuilt solar PV panel means your light comes straight from the sun - not expensive, disposable batteries. Charge Occa over and over again and never pay to power your light!  Our product is designed to be truly sustainable, with modular features that can be replaced so it won’t end up in landfill after a season.        By changing the way people study, work, and play, we can fight climate change together with sustainable lights that work for people and the planet.   We want to bring everyone, everywhere - access to clean, modern energy by connecting people to the sun. We deliver end-to-end, scalable solar solutions that save money and combat climate change.    We work in communities with limited access to electricity, empowering them to eliminate carbon emissions and helping them save money by alleviating the cost of kerosene fuel.    Qhubeka is a charity that helps people with little access to transportation in Africa. Their bicycles improve access to schools, clinics and jobs, and make it easier and quicker to carry goods, like water and food. As the recipients of our solar lights, Qhubeka can make traveling by bicycle safer and brighter.    HODI works to champion justice and development in the Horn of Africa through advocacy, education, peace building and sustainable livelihoods. Our lights will be distributed to the young women and girls they work with. This will give them access to a lightweight, portable solar light for studying, reading and traveling safely without having to rely on kerosene fuel or pay for expensive batteries.   Get Ahead Project Schools are low-fee, independent schools situated in Komani and Whittlesea, Eastern Cape, South Africa, providing quality education to black African youth, from local rural townships. Our solar lights will be donated to students to ensure that they have safe, solar lighting for studying when electricity fails, due to lack of reliable and consistent service provision.                   We are able to ship to the United States, the UK, the EU, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Australia, and Switzerland.

Enhance your lifestyle with a living ecosystem and bring the marvels of nature into your home!Eat better and live healthier, with the EcoGarden.  The unique growing method is known as ‘Aquaponics’. It is an ancient growing technique which uses the fish waste as the nutrient source for the plants, while the plants naturally filters the water which is recirculated back to the fish. A natural and effective way of cleaning your aquarium, creating the ultimate self-sustaining and resource efficient ecosystem where plants and fish live in symbiosis. It requires no soil or chemical fertilizers, and it’s totally free from pesticides.You feed the fish, the fish feed the plants, and the plants feed you!
Never think twice about watering your plants or feeding your fish, the EcoGarden does it for you! With its integrated sensors and innovative technology, it acts on its own, or reacts to your instructions. Check the temperature, feed your fish, or simply notify it that you’re going abroad for a few days! You’re always just one click away.

<p>Levia is a unique design product! It’s a desk lamp that uses the magnetic levitation system, a<br/>method by which one object is suspended on another, thanks to a magnetic field which can combat the gravitational pull effect.</p>
<p>It allows the levitation of an LED filament lamp with a very high energy efficiency.</p>
<p>Levia’s advanced technology, combined with its amazing design, will blow you away!</p>

<p>The Levia desk lamp is the result of the excellent Italian craftsmanship. The base is made of genuine Carrara or Black Marquina, which is cut by cnc and hand-finished for a polished and beautiful look.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Levia’s been cared to the last detail.</strong></p>
<p>The stem’s length allows the LED filament bulb to levitate at a height of about 20 cm from the ground and outside the space of the marble base: the effect is a perfect balance between the shapes and the levitation distance.</p>
<p> </p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p>The centre of gravity is completely unbalanced, because of the metal stem’s extension outwards with the levitation system and the floating bulb at the end. However, it’s perfectly counterbalanced by the marble base.</p>

<p>The fabric wire makes what has always been considered a disturbing element, an integral part of the design.</p>

<p>Levia is managed by 3 electronic boards: one placed in the marble base, one in the levitation system and one in the light bulb. The levitation of the light bulb is very effective and extremely stable, thanks to a bi-directional and automatic management of the device. It makes its use simple, preventing any destabilization at the same time.</p>

<p> </p>
<p> Levia also has an anti-fall system that forces the light bulb to attach itself to the upper part in the event of a blackout, accidental shocks or interruption of the current flow.</p>

<p>The bulb has no internal batteries and it turns on via electromagnetic induction. The bulb is warm light. Unlike the cold light, this warm light is often associated with positive feeling and the human mind perceives it as soft and enveloping. Furthermore, it allows less eye strain and it greatly improves the sleep quality.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Levia has a consumption of about 3 watts, equal to about 2 cents a day, and the LED light has a lifecycle of about 50000 working hours . So, if you used it for 8 hours a day for 365 days, the life span would be around 17 years.</p>

<p><strong>Levia’s use is very simple!</strong></p>
<p>You just have to bring the bulb near the upper part-from the bottom up- until you feel a magnetic force and the led filaments turn on simultaneously. And now you can let the light bulb float.</p>

Levia is a unique design product! It’s a desk lamp that uses the magnetic levitation system, amethod by which one object is suspended on another, thanks to a magnetic field which can combat the gravitational pull effect.
It allows the levitation of an LED filament lamp with a very high energy efficiency.
Levia’s advanced technology, combined with its amazing design, will blow you away!
 
 
 
The Levia desk lamp is the result of the excellent Italian craftsmanship. The base is made of genuine Carrara or Black Marquina, which is cut by cnc and hand-finished for a polished and beautiful look.
 


 
 
Everything at an affordable price to everyone!
 
 
 
Simple Shapes, Amazing Design!
 
Levia’s been cared to the last detail.
The stem’s length allows the LED filament bulb to levitate at a height of about 20 cm from the ground and outside the space of the marble base: the effect is a perfect balance between the shapes and the levitation distance.
 

 
The centre of gravity is completely unbalanced, because of the metal stem’s extension outwards with the levitation system and the floating bulb at the end. However, it’s perfectly counterbalanced by the marble base.
 

 
The marble base has also an anti-slip and anti-scratch rubberized support, to avoid scratches and protect the support surfaces.
 

 
The sensitive button allows you to switch off the LED filaments with a single touch, by keeping the light bulb in levitation at the same time.

 
The fabric wire makes what has always been considered a disturbing element, an integral part of the design.
The meticulous attention to detail, the stem's colors and the different types of marble give Levia a high-level design, suitable to any kind of environment and furniture.


 

With the Highest Quality Materials.
 
The metal stem gives structure strength and support.

 
The base is made of genuine Carrara marble or black Marquina marble.


Carrara marble is a high quality type of white or blue-grey marble,  quarried in the city of Carrara located in Tuscany, Italy.
 

Black Marquinia marble  is a high quality, black stone marble extracted from the region of Markina, Basque Country in the North of Spain. 
 

 
Every single piece is cut by cnc and then hand-finished, according to the age-old tradition of Italian craftsmanship, a process that makes the product unique and inimitable.
 
 
 
 
 
With an integrated anti-fall system and very high energy efficiency.
 
Levia is managed by 3 electronic boards: one placed in the marble base, one in the levitation system and one in the light bulb. The levitation of the light bulb is very effective and extremely stable, thanks to a bi-directional and automatic management of the device. It makes its use simple, preventing any destabilization at the same time.
 
 
 
We asked passers-by to try to levitate the light bulb to prove the ease of its use. This is the result!
 
  
 
 Levia also has an anti-fall system that forces the light bulb to attach itself to the upper part in the event of a blackout, accidental shocks or interruption of the current flow.
 
 
​
The bulb has no internal batteries and it turns on via electromagnetic induction. The bulb is warm light. Unlike the cold light, this warm light is often associated with positive feeling and the human mind perceives it as soft and enveloping. Furthermore, it allows less eye strain and it greatly improves the sleep quality.
 

 

 
Levia has a consumption of about 3 watts, equal to about 2 cents a day, and the LED light has a lifecycle of about 50000 working hours . So, if you used it for 8 hours a day for 365 days, the life span would be around 17 years.
 

 
 
 
 
Levia’s use is very simple!
You just have to bring the bulb near the upper part-from the bottom up- until you feel a magnetic force and the led filaments turn on simultaneously. And now you can let the light bulb float.

As mentioned above, the light bulb has no batteries and it turns on via electromagnetic induction!
 
 
 
If you want to switch off just the led filaments, you just have to touch the sensitive button on the marble base: in this way the bulb will continue to float.
 

 
The bulb will attach itself to the upper part instead of falling and breaking in the event of interruption of the current flow, thanks to the anti-fall system.
 

 
 
 

 

 

Levia is available in 5 different versions. 
 

 

 




Basic Version - Black or White metal stem and Carrara or Black Marquinia marble base.

Special Versione - Brass-lacquered metal stem and Carrara or Black Marquinia marble base.

Deluxe Version - Gold-plated copper stem and Portoro marble base.

 

 



 
The Levia Deluxe Portoro version has a real gold-plated copper stem and a Portoro marble base.
 

The gold-plated copper stem emphasizes the golden veins of the marble. The golden touch button fits perfectly to the base. The advanced technology, combined with the highest quality materials, makes Levia Deluxe Portoro something totally new and never seen before: it becomes a high-class design object, with a very high value. 
 

Portoro is a very precious variety of dark brilliant black marble with golden veins. Portoro marble can be found only in the province of La Spezia in Liguria, Italy.
 

 
We would like to give you the opportunity to pledge the Deluxe Portoro version, at an exclusive price, when we reach € 250,000 goal.

Risks and challenges
 
The careful study of the product before, and the prototyping phase then, allowed us to reach , an already finished product, even before the launch of the campaign.
We already got samples from companies that will be our future suppliers and producers.
Almost all the components of Levia are ready for production; we just have to make some small improvements so that the product will be perfect in every details.
These are the reasons why we firmly believe we can meet the expected delivery times in the campaign.
However, we will keep you constantly updated on product developments and production status. We thank you so much for the support, we are sure that all of you will love Levia!",61.0,0,"7 Campaigns

The concept behind Geizeer is that we don’t want waste this energy but, instead, we use it to take a break from the heat and give refreshment.  Geizeer is a cube-shaped desk cooler and perfume diffuser, eco friendly and fruit of high Italian handcraft.The customized ice-pack allows air output to 360 degrees and a powerful air diffusion. It is a low-consumption and USB rechargeable device. That is the reason why you can use Geizeer all day long and in any location.Geizeer is button free and it turns on due to magnetic contacts. When the two halves are not in contact with each other, the fan stops. This security system makes Geizeer safe also for children and animals.""Picture by our Customer""----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Each item is CNC machined from a solid block of wood, before being hand-finished and colored. Each Geizeer is a unique piece with unique wood grains. The entire process is carried out respecting the centuries-old Italian handicraft tradition.The electronic board has been re-engineered with state-of-the-art components. The outcome is less heat loss, less energy consumption and longer duration. The integrated electronic board prevents the battery from breakdown in the event of short-circuit and overload. Moreover, this system guarantees over 600 charging cycles.The red/blue LED on the USB cable shows the power status of Geizeer.Red light charging / blue light full battery. Easy!Furthermore, you can use the cable to charge any other device with mini-USB port and to transfer data between devices. The fan is developed and produced by Enermax, world leader in PC components production.The blades and this technology, both patented, significantly reduce noise and electricity consumption. And besides, it increases air-flow efficiency and the life of the product up to 100.000 hours of usage. Choose the speed you like with one touch: Ultra Silent Mode (1,000 RPM) / Silent Mode (1,500 RPM) / Performance Mode (1,800 RPM). The fan is customized according to our needs and fits perfectly into the wood. Its light grey colour looks good in any model and coloration of Geizeer. No more glue that hinders the current flow. Just strong magnets to give a steady grip between the two halves of Geizeer.Align the two dots and let the magnets do their job!Geizeer air freshener is made of paper from pulp 3mm thick. Its shape is designed for “zero waste”.Each circle can be taken off from the whole card at various time for a better preservation of the fragrance. As the circles run out, use the air freshener card wherever you like! Put one removable circle on the proper room on the top of the ice pack.As the circles run out, add a little string and use it in your car. Push where indicated to create a hook on the air freshener. Use it wherever you like, also in your wardrobe!  The mat in neoprene thermally isolates the wood from the ice pack, protecting Geizeer.Pull the mat tab to easily lift up the ice pack. - OLD PACKAGING - NEW PACKAGING  Our customized packaging is impact resistant and fully recyclable.

However, if for some reason it ends up in a landfill, the Micro will decompose in as little as 5 years, compared to some plastics that take decades to decompose.</p><p> </p><h3>Sustainable materials</h3><p>The main material used in the creation of the Micro is derived from Vegetable starches, usually corn and sugar cane. It is renewable, sustainable, and helps use by-product from other industries that would have ended up in the landfill.</p><p> </p><h3>Environmentally friendly factories</h3><p>We're a vertically integrated startup. We understand that it makes it a lot more difficult but it allows us to control every step of the process. From the sourcing of north american made Bio-polymers to manufacturing &amp; packing our own products. This ensures that we operate ethically and remain environmentally friendly. Our manufacturing facilities are also optimized to reduce waste as much as possible, and recycle waste product to be reused wherever we can. All in house.</p><p> </p><h3>Sustainable Distribution</h3><p>All our products are packaged in recyclable/compost-able material. We ensure the contents of the package are safe while minimizing material required. Boxes contain at least 10% recycled paper.</p><p> </p><h3>Something else</h3><p>The very nature of our product is carbon negative. The more you use it, the better it gets.

From creating jobs, helping reduce food waste, or building vertical farms in the oceans, know that you're supporting a innovative startup that is willing to take massive action.  Risks and challenges Why are seedpads Canada only?Our seedpads contain organic seeds embedded in hemp fibre mats and covered. This means that most departments of agriculture will NOT allow them to be imported as they are unable to identify the seeds easily, as well as the possibility of certain species being invasive, and other reasons.At this time we are only offering our Canadian backers seedpads, and empty Seedpads with extra tools for international backers  in order to keep fulfillment running as smoothly as possible. We are actively making progress with getting Seedpads into the USA at the moment. Fulfillment time & process: We're looking at being able to fulfill most units within the next 4-6 months of the Indiegogo campaign completing.We'll be fulfilling units of earlier backers first, so if you backed our project on the last day, that's still fantastic and you'll still receive your reward, but it may take slightly longer than some other backers.With the pandemic still going strong, please understand that there may be delays in the global shipping system, some countries may receive their rewards as soon as 1-2 weeks after shipping while other may experience delays of 3-6 weeks or more depending on where you live.Backers's rewards will be organized and processed through our online store system, so you will receive details (such as tracking #'s if available) regarding your package and shipment by email or text from our site.The more we raise the quicker fulfillment will be.Surpassing the goal by large amounts will allow us to bring more processes in house instead of sourcing them internationally. Allowing us to:- Bring bio-plastic resins in house where they will be processed, extruded, and used in manufacturing all under the same roof.- Get more, higher quality printers and exponentially increase production.- Create some jobs! We'll likely be hiring someone to help automate the assembly line, someone to manage our print farm, and another position as well.- Get some awesome universal robots to help our staff do all the heavy lifting & repetitive processes quicker and safer. Final Notes:2020 has been an extremely unpredictable year so far, and we have no idea what to expect with our fulfillment window extending into 2021. No matter what happens though, you had our backs and we'll have yours. Expect frequent updates and reports from our founding team. Our goal is to be as transparent and authentic with our backers as possible. Our Environmental Commitments Long-lasting designThe Micro has a extremely durable build. You probably won't be dropping your garden a lot, but if you do, it'll survive the fall. The Micro is easy to clean with some soap, water, and a sponge. Allowing you to use and re-use it year after year. Reusability and recyclabilityWith a durable build of over 85% biodegradable & compostable material, the micro will last as long as you will. However, if for some reason it ends up in a landfill, the Micro will decompose in as little as 5 years, compared to some plastics that take decades to decompose. Sustainable materialsThe main material used in the creation of the Micro is derived from Vegetable starches, usually corn and sugar cane. It is renewable, sustainable, and helps use by-product from other industries that would have ended up in the landfill. Environmentally friendly factoriesWe're a vertically integrated startup. We understand that it makes it a lot more difficult but it allows us to control every step of the process. From the sourcing of north american made Bio-polymers to manufacturing & packing our own products. This ensures that we operate ethically and remain environmentally friendly. Our manufacturing facilities are also optimized to reduce waste as much as possible, and recycle waste product to be reused wherever we can. All in house. Sustainable DistributionAll our products are packaged in recyclable/compost-able material. We ensure the contents of the package are safe while minimizing material required. Boxes contain at least 10% recycled paper. Something elseThe very nature of our product is carbon negative. The more you use it, the better it gets. Growing plants not only feeds you, but feeds into our sustainability mission.",34.0,2,"1 Campaign

<p>There are 2 types of inverters available on the market. Pure sine wave inverters provide the same type of electrical signal generated by your power company. This is what most electronics are built to work with. The other type is ""modified sine wave"" inverters. They are cheaper, but the cost is many electronic devices will not work optimally with them. This is the reason we've chosen to go with pure sine wave for all of our MegaPower battery storage products. Only optimal output and performance for all your power needs.</p>

<p><strong>Super fast charging times compared to typical lead acid batteries found in battery storage units today. Other advantages over acid lead batteries:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Lightweight </strong>(90% Lighter)</li>
<li>
<strong>Smaller size</strong> and footprint</li>
<li>
<strong>Much greater DOD</strong> (Depth of Discharge) meaning how much of the battery you can safely use. 50% is the DOD for Lead Acid, while Lithium batteries found in MegaPower UPS+ can have a 100% DOD. We however recommend a maximum of 90% Discharge with 80% or less being optimal for extended battery life and increased power over time</li>
<li>
<strong>Recharges 2X as fast</strong> as Lead Acid batteries</li>
<li>
<strong>Longer life</strong> typically Lead Acid batteries need to be replaced every year or two. Our high quality Lithium batteries can last 5+ years with many companies providing 10 year warranties on their battery life.</li>

</div></div>","Have you ever wanted to have an easily movable source of clean power that can meet even the most demanding of devices and appliances?

Something so powerful it could power your fridge if the power went out for a whole day? But light enough to bring in a backpack to the beach or Sunday picnic?



Enjoy your very own MegaPower UPS +Solar power storage system for emergencies, outdoor entertainment and fun!!

 






Environmentally Friendly - 100% green energy production!

Multipurpose Product - Take it anywhere and use it where ever you need power

Emergency Use - Never be caught without power again

Car Use - Boost your battery safe and easy

Home Use - Blackouts, garden, backyard or anywhere around the home

Office Use - UPS back up power solution
Outdoor Use: Picnics, beach, parks or anywhere, bring your electronics with you and enjoy charging, cooling or even a full projection theater with surround sound on the beach!




1399 Watt/hours or a whopping 378,108 mAH of battery capacity
932 Watt/hours or 251,891 mAH of battery capacity
5000 Watt/hours or 1,351,351 mAH of battery capacity @3.7V.


There are 2 types of inverters available on the market. Pure sine wave inverters provide the same type of electrical signal generated by your power company. This is what most electronics are built to work with. The other type is ""modified sine wave"" inverters. They are cheaper, but the cost is many electronic devices will not work optimally with them. This is the reason we've chosen to go with pure sine wave for all of our MegaPower battery storage products. Only optimal output and performance for all your power needs.


Plug your +Solar panel directly into the MegaPower UPS to get free power during the day. Whats better than FREE and GREEN Power during the day and night?


You may just need to pick up a few of these units for your house and office. MegaPower UPS+ is also an uninterruptible power supply.
Step 1: Connect your main power supply directly to the MegaPower UPS+ AC Input
Step 2: Plug-in your sensitive office or electrical equipment through MegaPower UPS+.
Congratulations! You've now completed the installation for your automatic backup power system.
If there is a blackout, within 5 MILLISECONDS Megapower UPS+ will automatically switch on and continue to power everything connected to it. Your data, WiFi, unfinished work and equipment will all be left safe and available.


Similar to UPS function, this allows you to charge MegaPower UPS +Solar while continuing to use it at the same time. With multiple ways of charging from:

Solar or wind charging (160W Portable = 6-7 hours) (330W Dual Glass 3-4 hours)
Regular wall outlet charging ( 8-9 Hours)
Fast charging cable (optional) (4-5 hours)



Super fast charging times compared to typical lead acid batteries found in battery storage units today. Other advantages over acid lead batteries:


Lightweight (90% Lighter)

Smaller size and footprint

Much greater DOD (Depth of Discharge) meaning how much of the battery you can safely use. 50% is the DOD for Lead Acid, while Lithium batteries found in MegaPower UPS+ can have a 100% DOD. We however recommend a maximum of 90% Discharge with 80% or less being optimal for extended battery life and increased power over time

Recharges 2X as fast as Lead Acid batteries

Longer life typically Lead Acid batteries need to be replaced every year or two. Our high quality Lithium batteries can last 5+ years with many companies providing 10 year warranties on their battery life.


Our #1 Concern. We have many built-in safety features that give you and your family peace of mind. 

Short Circuit Protection
Over Voltage Protection
Under Voltage Protection
Over Charge Protection
Temperature Protection

2 year performance warranty for MegaPower UPS+ 1000W

3 year performance warranty for MegaPower UPS+ 1400W

5 year performance warranty for MegaPower UPS+ 5000W

3 year performance warranty for +Solar portable panels

25 year performance warranty for +Solar dual glass panel



Depending on your Country. Be sure to choose the right option when checking out.      (We will confirm with you before shipping again)

Most products on the market today require 3 separate pieces of equipment for Solar + Storage Systems:

Battery Capacity
Power Inverter
Solar Controller

With MegaPower UPS +Solar Storage all you need to do is plug in your solar panels and GO!

It runs on standard-size, rechargeable batteries. Just swap out drained batteries with charged batteries.</strong></h3><p>SlingIt is powered by standard-sized, 8 or 10 amp, rechargeable, lithium-ion, 18650 batteries. Many battery manufacturers consistently produce high-quality 18650 cells, including Panasonic, Samsung, Sanyo, and Tenergy. You find them all over the world in electric cars, electric bikes, power tools, flashlights, and battery packs. Keep spare, charged batteries on-hand. When batteries are drained, simply swap them out with recharged batteries and keep using your SlingIt. </p><p>SlingIt operates using six batteries. Six batteries and two battery smart-chargers are provided with each SlingIt purchase. </p><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/581851806?portrait=0""></iframe></div></div><div>(<a href=""https://www.jaguarwearabletechnologies.com/video-gallery"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">View more in our video gallery</a>)</div><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/587297414?portrait=0""></iframe></div></div><div><div>(<a href=""https://www.jaguarwearabletechnologies.com/video-gallery"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">View more in our video gallery</a>)</div></div><div>

<p><strong>During our SlingIt application tests:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Six 3500 mAh batteries energized a WOW 2160 lumen LED work light for <strong>over 3 hours</strong>.</li>
<li>Six 3500 mAh batteries recharged a lower capacity internal mobile phone battery <strong>7x</strong> (from 0% to 100%).</li>
<li>Six 3500 mAh batteries energized 1 of the water pumps we intend to deploy in our CleanIt water filtration system for<strong> over 5 hours</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Not bad for less than 12 ounces of battery weight.</strong></p>
</div><div> </div><h3><strong>2) Keep track of your battery performance using readily available smart chargers.</strong></h3><p>Easily load six batteries at a time into SlingIt. When drained, swap out batteries with fresh batteries and keep using your SlingIt. Charging individual batteries is much more efficient than charging a big battery pack. Recharge your 18650 batteries via smart chargers; you never need to charge SlingIt! Smart chargers identify degraded or failing batteries, remove them from your battery inventory to preserve peak SlingIt performance.</p><p>Two smart chargers are supplied with each SlingIt purchase.</p><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/581852795?portrait=0""></iframe></div></div><div>

<div> </div>
</div><h3><strong>4) SlingIt is lightweight and wearable.</strong></h3><p>The SlingIt power system is lightweight and is designed to be worn like a pack or a cross-body “sling” bag. SlingIt is carried in a custom, padded, dual layer, heavy canvas cylindrical bag, surrounded by 10 rows of MOLLE loops.</p><p>MOLLE stands for “Modular Lightweight Load-Carrying Equipment”; it is a common standard used by manufactures who design interconnecting packs and pouches. By weaving straps attached to MOLLE-compatible accessories through the bag's loops, you can construct your own pack solution. The bags loop arrays are used to attach the bag's shoulder straps and enable you to adjust how your pack straddles your back.</p><div> </div><div>

</div><h3><strong>5) SlingIt is weather-resistant.</strong></h3><p>SlingIt has a single, standard size, 12 volt socket. The single socket is weather-resistant, as end caps protect the system from contamination. SlingIt has no delicate, leak prone, displays or switches, which can be contaminated by water and soils. Applying a thin layer of non-conductive dielectric grease, to the battery assembly's disk shaped seals provides extra protection. SlingIt's bag is treated for water and stain resistance. </p><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/591083159?portrait=0""></iframe></div></div><div><div>(<a href=""https://www.jaguarwearabletechnologies.com/video-gallery"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">View more in our video gallery</a>)</div></div><h3><strong>6) SlingIt is a long life device made from premium materials.</strong></h3><p>SlingIt is designed to have a long life and is primarily made from:</p><ul>
<li>110 Copper</li>
<li>6061-T6 and 7075-T651 Aluminum</li>
<li>Ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene.</li>
</ul><p>Its simple design makes SlingIt easy to clean, maintain, and, eventually, recycle.</p><h3><strong>7) Jaguar sustainably builds its products in the USA.</strong></h3><p>Jaguar team members have directed manufacturing efforts for 30+ years. We understand when automation is required and when a human touch is preferable.</p><p>We begin the process of building your system upon your purchase. To eliminate wasteful excess inventory, and to ensure product/component improvements are incorporated into our product as soon as possible, Jaguar products are assembled on-demand (upon order). Hardware components, designed by the team, are fabricated in small batches. We transport scrap copper, aluminum, and polyethylene pieces to recyclers.</p><p>Cost reduction, via overseas manufacturing, would necessitate mass manufacturing, which is wasteful and slows the deployment of incremental improvements to product components. I.e. Lower cost mass manufacturing necessitates the sales of large inventories prior to the deployment of design improvements.</p><ul>
<li>Jaguar Wearable Technologies is located in U.S.</li>
<li>The team's hardware products are designed and assembled by hand in the U.S.</li>
<li>Hardware components, designed by the team, are fabricated in the U.S.</li>
</ul><p>Every system is tested after assembly and every part used to build each system is cataloged to improve service whenever you need support.</p><h3><strong>CleanIt Coming Soon</strong></h3><ul>
<li>CleanIt, a portable, electrically pumped, water filtration solution. </li>
<li>CleanIt will be dimensionally compatible with SlingIt. CleanIt can be powered by SlingIt or another 12 volt, 10 amp DC power source and standard socket.</li>

<h3><strong>Jaguar Wearable Technologies’ Limited Product Warranty</strong></h3>
<p>We are responsible for SlingIt’s materials and manufacturing. We will repair or replace your SlingIt’s components due to materials or manufacturing flaws up to one year from date of purchase, so long as you use your SlingIt in accordance with SlingIt’s instructions for use. We are not responsible for damage resulting from misuse.</p>
<p>We give you the freedom to select your own 18650 batteries. It is up to you to use the batteries safely and responsibly.</p>
<p>JAGUAR WEARABLE TECHNOLOGIES DOES NOT MANUFACTURE, INTEGRATE, DISTRIBUTE, OR RE-SELL BATTERIES. WE DO NOT PROVIDE BATTERY WARRANTIES. WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR BATTERY PERFORMANCE OR THE USE/MISUSE OF BATTERIES BY THE END-USER.</p>
<h3><strong>Where to Buy Batteries for your SlingIt</strong></h3>
<p>You can buy 18650 batteries online from online retailers. Good places to start include: liionwholesale.com, power.tenergy.com, IMRbatteries, and 18650batterystore.com. These sites include detailed battery specifications and safety information. Some dealers offer “bulk” discounts.</p>
<ul>
<li>When it comes to storing and using rechargeable Lithium Ion batteries, here are some notes you need to review carefully.</li>
<li>SlingIt supports “button-top” batteries exclusively. Button top style batteries are like the C or D cell batteries you commonly use in flashlights.</li>
<li>Always use 5, 8, or 10 amp batteries in your SlingIt. Never insert a battery claiming to support greater than 10 amps into your SlingIt.</li>
<li>Power your SlingIt using “protected” 18650 batteries. Each protected battery has its own small circular circuit board installed in its tip. Protection circuits are installed by battery component integrators and dealers. This protection circuit protects the battery from overcharge, or over-discharge.</li>
<li>Always use standard-length, 65mm-67mm, 18650 batteries. Protected, button-top batteries add about 2mm to the overall length of an 18650 battery.</li>
<li>Always install 6 batteries made by the same company, and which have the same capacity and amperage specifications into your SlingIt. You may have an inventory of batteries built by different companies, with different capacities, and which support different amperages; so make certain you keep your batteries sorted so you only have 1 type of battery installed at any one time.</li>
<li>Always follow the battery manufacturer’s/battery distributor’s directions for safety and handling.</li>

Higher mileage numbers are good. Fewer calories is good. A higher price tag on a restaurant menu must mean it’s tastier. We all know sales teams can be loose with the truth.</p><p>Battery pack pitch teams are no different than those selling cars or diet food. They use a confounding assortment of numbers, inserted among long strings of mysterious words to convince us the product they’re pitching is preferable to a competitive product. If you’ve been shopping for a battery pack you’ve likely seen lots of numbers associated with terms like volts, amps, milliampere hours, watt hours, etc. Some numbers you recognize because you’ve put them to use. You understand that devices you operate require a certain number of volts / amps, but many other numbers, however, are difficult to relate to practical experiences.</p><p>This brief letter intends to provide you with some practical battery pack capacity information, which we hope you can put to good use so you make the best decision “for you.”</p><p>Recharging time is just as important as pack capacity</p><p>You likely know the range your car / truck will travel via a single tank of fuel. It’s important because the range reflects the cost of traveling a specific distance. It’s important because you may be concerned about the availability of fuel along a long stretch of isolated road. What’s less important is the amount of time you will spend pumping fuel into your vehicle; because pumps refill your tank in a small handful of minutes. Only if there is a shortage of refueling stations and fuel pumps could “refueling time” become an issue.</p><p>Unlike refilling your car’s gas tank, the practical use of rechargeable batteries has a lot to do with recharge times.</p><p>Some of us who use combustion engine cars may consider owning an electric car, dependent upon rechargeable battery technology, if we lived very predictable lives that accommodated multiple hours of recharge time. If we typically traveled distances daily (to and from home) less than the range supported by a single “charge,” and we could always fully recharge our car’s batteries over night, electric vehicles might have some cool perks we would enjoy.</p><p>Once drained, most high capacity (so-called) portable battery packs require between 8 - 24 hours to fully recharge, via a typical home’s power outlet, thus leashing the pack to that outlet for 8 to 24 hours.</p><p>If you must own a typical plug-in, rechargeable battery pack, we advise that you (1) do your best to predict how many “contiguous hours you are willing to forfeit your pack’s availability,” in order to completely recharge your pack after each usage period; and then (2) purchase only the amount of pack capacity that you can fully recharge within that number of hours. For example, if you can commit to plugging in your pack each night for 8 hours, purchase a pack that can be fully recharged in 8 hours. If you need more (drainage) capacity, buy additional packs instead of purchasing a higher capacity pack. If you drain 2 packs, you can charge each pack for 8 hours via their own outlet.</p><p>Do you sense a “pattern” here? If you cannot predict the availability of recharging resources, or you cannot predict how long you can forfeit a pack’s availability (to recharge it), a single plug-in rechargeable battery pack is not a practical power source, no matter what’s its capacity.</p><p>Redundancy is often more valuable than pack capacity</p><p>Batteries degrade as they are drained and recharged. Individual batteries, even those of the same model, made by the same company, degrade at different rates. Most packs contain groups of batteries (referred to a “series”), which are wired and or spot welded together, and thus, interdependent. Just a single degraded battery in a series can degrade the other batteries ability to drain and to recharge. Over time, pack capacity degrades.</p><p>Here is a simple example (just for comparison) of how things can go wrong when charging groups (series) of batteries. Imagine you have a row of 6 identical bath tubs side by side. You install big cylinders, horizontally, connecting tub 1 to tub 2, tub 3 to 4, 4 to 5 and 5 to 6. The cylinders (connecting the tubs) are at the same height from the floor. You fill up tub 1 and when tub 1’s water level reaches the cylinder, water flows into tub 2. When the water level in tub 2 reaches the cylinder connecting it to tub 3, tub 3 fills up to the same level as tubs 1 and 2. Eventually, all the tubs end up with the same water level. Now, empty the tubs and drill a big hole in side wall of tub 3 (bigger than the the internal diameter of the cylinders) below the height of the cylinder connecting tub 3 to tub 4. Refill the tubs, via tub 1. As a result of the hole in tub 3; tubs 4, 5 and 6 never refill.</p><p>To mask this problem, pack makers install multiple groups of batteries (which run in parallel) and try keep the groups’ charges in balance, but masking the problem doesn’t halt degradation, that’s why most reputable battery and battery pack makers publish the estimated number of recharge cycles their battery or pack can endure, prior to 20% its (capacity) degradation (under ideal conditions).</p><p>Masking the problem becomes more and more complex as a greater quantity of battery groups are managed by a pack’s battery management system.</p><p>The Jaguar team believes their truth in the saying: “don’t put all your eggs in one basket” however, we believe that the solution is to NOT interconnect more and more batteries in a single pack. If you need capacity and must own a “plug-in” pack, you’re are better off owning and operating multiple packs.</p><p>If you’re open to learning about SlingIt, our team’s solution to the “plug-in pack” dilemma, please read-on.</p><h3>18650 battery and SlingIt capacity</h3><p>Standard size 18650, 8 and 10 amp, rechargeable batteries typically advertise capacities between 2500 and 3500 milliamp hours (mAh). You load six of the same 18650 batteries into a SlingIt to generate 12 volts and up to 10 amps of power. When the system can’t deliver 12 volts via the power provided by the batteries, SlingIt shuts down the power to its 12 volt socket. When the power shuts down, swap out the drained batteries with charged batteries. Insert the drained batteries into smart chargers (of the same make and model) and they will tell you if any of the individual batteries are degraded. Replace any number of degraded batteries with good batteries. The degradation problems are resolved, not masked.</p><p>Why are we willing to let you quickly replace drained batteries with charged batteries rather then taking the pack off line to accommodate hours of (pack plug-in pack) recharging? Why do we enable you to detect and replace degraded batteries? Because, it’s not our job to sell batteries, whether or not those batteries are packed into packs. It’s not our job to sell you multiple packs, to overcome recharge times and degraded batteries.</p><p>We consider it our job to enable you to build a battery and smart charger inventory which best meets your needs.</p><p>We consider it our job to ensure you have safe access to power almost any where and almost any time.</p><p>During our SlingIt application tests:</p><ul>

4) SlingIt is lightweight and wearable.The SlingIt power system is lightweight and is designed to be worn like a pack or a cross-body “sling” bag. SlingIt is carried in a custom, padded, dual layer, heavy canvas cylindrical bag, surrounded by 10 rows of MOLLE loops.MOLLE stands for “Modular Lightweight Load-Carrying Equipment”; it is a common standard used by manufactures who design interconnecting packs and pouches. By weaving straps attached to MOLLE-compatible accessories through the bag's loops, you can construct your own pack solution. The bags loop arrays are used to attach the bag's shoulder straps and enable you to adjust how your pack straddles your back.

5) SlingIt is weather-resistant.SlingIt has a single, standard size, 12 volt socket. The single socket is weather-resistant, as end caps protect the system from contamination. SlingIt has no delicate, leak prone, displays or switches, which can be contaminated by water and soils. Applying a thin layer of non-conductive dielectric grease, to the battery assembly's disk shaped seals provides extra protection. SlingIt's bag is treated for water and stain resistance. (View more in our video gallery)6) SlingIt is a long life device made from premium materials.SlingIt is designed to have a long life and is primarily made from:
110 Copper
6061-T6 and 7075-T651 Aluminum
Ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene.
Its simple design makes SlingIt easy to clean, maintain, and, eventually, recycle.7) Jaguar sustainably builds its products in the USA.Jaguar team members have directed manufacturing efforts for 30+ years. We understand when automation is required and when a human touch is preferable.We begin the process of building your system upon your purchase. To eliminate wasteful excess inventory, and to ensure product/component improvements are incorporated into our product as soon as possible, Jaguar products are assembled on-demand (upon order). Hardware components, designed by the team, are fabricated in small batches. We transport scrap copper, aluminum, and polyethylene pieces to recyclers.Cost reduction, via overseas manufacturing, would necessitate mass manufacturing, which is wasteful and slows the deployment of incremental improvements to product components. I.e. Lower cost mass manufacturing necessitates the sales of large inventories prior to the deployment of design improvements.
Jaguar Wearable Technologies is located in U.S.
The team's hardware products are designed and assembled by hand in the U.S.
Hardware components, designed by the team, are fabricated in the U.S.
Every system is tested after assembly and every part used to build each system is cataloged to improve service whenever you need support.CleanIt Coming Soon
CleanIt, a portable, electrically pumped, water filtration solution. 
CleanIt will be dimensionally compatible with SlingIt. CleanIt can be powered by SlingIt or another 12 volt, 10 amp DC power source and standard socket.
CleanIt will sell for $1099.00. You will be able to pre-order CleanIt in mid December and units will begin shipping in January.

Jaguar Wearable Technologies’ Limited Product Warranty
We are responsible for SlingIt’s materials and manufacturing. We will repair or replace your SlingIt’s components due to materials or manufacturing flaws up to one year from date of purchase, so long as you use your SlingIt in accordance with SlingIt’s instructions for use. We are not responsible for damage resulting from misuse.
We give you the freedom to select your own 18650 batteries. It is up to you to use the batteries safely and responsibly.
JAGUAR WEARABLE TECHNOLOGIES DOES NOT MANUFACTURE, INTEGRATE, DISTRIBUTE, OR RE-SELL BATTERIES. WE DO NOT PROVIDE BATTERY WARRANTIES. WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR BATTERY PERFORMANCE OR THE USE/MISUSE OF BATTERIES BY THE END-USER.
Where to Buy Batteries for your SlingIt
You can buy 18650 batteries online from online retailers. Good places to start include: liionwholesale.com, power.tenergy.com, IMRbatteries, and 18650batterystore.com. These sites include detailed battery specifications and safety information. Some dealers offer “bulk” discounts.

When it comes to storing and using rechargeable Lithium Ion batteries, here are some notes you need to review carefully.
SlingIt supports “button-top” batteries exclusively. Button top style batteries are like the C or D cell batteries you commonly use in flashlights.
Always use 5, 8, or 10 amp batteries in your SlingIt. Never insert a battery claiming to support greater than 10 amps into your SlingIt.
Power your SlingIt using “protected” 18650 batteries. Each protected battery has its own small circular circuit board installed in its tip. Protection circuits are installed by battery component integrators and dealers. This protection circuit protects the battery from overcharge, or over-discharge.
Always use standard-length, 65mm-67mm, 18650 batteries. Protected, button-top batteries add about 2mm to the overall length of an 18650 battery.
Always install 6 batteries made by the same company, and which have the same capacity and amperage specifications into your SlingIt. You may have an inventory of batteries built by different companies, with different capacities, and which support different amperages; so make certain you keep your batteries sorted so you only have 1 type of battery installed at any one time.
Always follow the battery manufacturer’s/battery distributor’s directions for safety and handling.

Lithium-Ion battery ingredients and circuits are contained in metal cylinders wrapped in plastic skins. Never install a battery with a damaged skin into your SlingIt.
Use 18650 batteries components made by reputable companies like Sanyo, Panasonic, Samsung and Tenergy; known for consistently delivering safe, high-performance products.
Use smart chargers to safely recharge your batteries, identify degraded batteries and to identify faulty and failing batteries.
SlingIt was brought to market, in part, to minimize battery waste streams. Please safely dispose of batteries and all e-waste responsibly.

Please Note:  During COVID lock downs, and now, following the (recent) end of lock downs, the highest capacity, protected, button top, name brand, 18650 batteries have been in short supply; but can be found among dealers with a bit of effort. Short supplies have led to higher battery prices. If you can’t find the highest capacity name brand batteries you desire we recommend you purchase lower capacity name brand batteries and resist the temptation of purchasing off-brand batteries which may provide inconsistent safety, performance, and longevity.

Charger’s, converter’s, and batteries’ brands may differ based on availability.Battery Pack Marketing Teams Confound Us with Capacity Claims…..But they’re just doing their jobs.A letter from Jaguar Wearable Technologies FoundersDear Reader,Sales teams commonly conflate “sets of numbers” with product value. Higher mileage numbers are good. Fewer calories is good. A higher price tag on a restaurant menu must mean it’s tastier. We all know sales teams can be loose with the truth.Battery pack pitch teams are no different than those selling cars or diet food. They use a confounding assortment of numbers, inserted among long strings of mysterious words to convince us the product they’re pitching is preferable to a competitive product. If you’ve been shopping for a battery pack you’ve likely seen lots of numbers associated with terms like volts, amps, milliampere hours, watt hours, etc. Some numbers you recognize because you’ve put them to use. You understand that devices you operate require a certain number of volts / amps, but many other numbers, however, are difficult to relate to practical experiences.This brief letter intends to provide you with some practical battery pack capacity information, which we hope you can put to good use so you make the best decision “for you.”Recharging time is just as important as pack capacityYou likely know the range your car / truck will travel via a single tank of fuel. It’s important because the range reflects the cost of traveling a specific distance. It’s important because you may be concerned about the availability of fuel along a long stretch of isolated road. What’s less important is the amount of time you will spend pumping fuel into your vehicle; because pumps refill your tank in a small handful of minutes. Only if there is a shortage of refueling stations and fuel pumps could “refueling time” become an issue.Unlike refilling your car’s gas tank, the practical use of rechargeable batteries has a lot to do with recharge times.Some of us who use combustion engine cars may consider owning an electric car, dependent upon rechargeable battery technology, if we lived very predictable lives that accommodated multiple hours of recharge time. If we typically traveled distances daily (to and from home) less than the range supported by a single “charge,” and we could always fully recharge our car’s batteries over night, electric vehicles might have some cool perks we would enjoy.Once drained, most high capacity (so-called) portable battery packs require between 8 - 24 hours to fully recharge, via a typical home’s power outlet, thus leashing the pack to that outlet for 8 to 24 hours.If you must own a typical plug-in, rechargeable battery pack, we advise that you (1) do your best to predict how many “contiguous hours you are willing to forfeit your pack’s availability,” in order to completely recharge your pack after each usage period; and then (2) purchase only the amount of pack capacity that you can fully recharge within that number of hours. For example, if you can commit to plugging in your pack each night for 8 hours, purchase a pack that can be fully recharged in 8 hours. If you need more (drainage) capacity, buy additional packs instead of purchasing a higher capacity pack. If you drain 2 packs, you can charge each pack for 8 hours via their own outlet.Do you sense a “pattern” here? If you cannot predict the availability of recharging resources, or you cannot predict how long you can forfeit a pack’s availability (to recharge it), a single plug-in rechargeable battery pack is not a practical power source, no matter what’s its capacity.Redundancy is often more valuable than pack capacityBatteries degrade as they are drained and recharged. Individual batteries, even those of the same model, made by the same company, degrade at different rates. Most packs contain groups of batteries (referred to a “series”), which are wired and or spot welded together, and thus, interdependent. Just a single degraded battery in a series can degrade the other batteries ability to drain and to recharge. Over time, pack capacity degrades.Here is a simple example (just for comparison) of how things can go wrong when charging groups (series) of batteries. Imagine you have a row of 6 identical bath tubs side by side. You install big cylinders, horizontally, connecting tub 1 to tub 2, tub 3 to 4, 4 to 5 and 5 to 6. The cylinders (connecting the tubs) are at the same height from the floor. You fill up tub 1 and when tub 1’s water level reaches the cylinder, water flows into tub 2. When the water level in tub 2 reaches the cylinder connecting it to tub 3, tub 3 fills up to the same level as tubs 1 and 2. Eventually, all the tubs end up with the same water level. Now, empty the tubs and drill a big hole in side wall of tub 3 (bigger than the the internal diameter of the cylinders) below the height of the cylinder connecting tub 3 to tub 4. Refill the tubs, via tub 1. As a result of the hole in tub 3; tubs 4, 5 and 6 never refill.To mask this problem, pack makers install multiple groups of batteries (which run in parallel) and try keep the groups’ charges in balance, but masking the problem doesn’t halt degradation, that’s why most reputable battery and battery pack makers publish the estimated number of recharge cycles their battery or pack can endure, prior to 20% its (capacity) degradation (under ideal conditions).Masking the problem becomes more and more complex as a greater quantity of battery groups are managed by a pack’s battery management system.The Jaguar team believes their truth in the saying: “don’t put all your eggs in one basket” however, we believe that the solution is to NOT interconnect more and more batteries in a single pack. If you need capacity and must own a “plug-in” pack, you’re are better off owning and operating multiple packs.If you’re open to learning about SlingIt, our team’s solution to the “plug-in pack” dilemma, please read-on.18650 battery and SlingIt capacityStandard size 18650, 8 and 10 amp, rechargeable batteries typically advertise capacities between 2500 and 3500 milliamp hours (mAh). You load six of the same 18650 batteries into a SlingIt to generate 12 volts and up to 10 amps of power. When the system can’t deliver 12 volts via the power provided by the batteries, SlingIt shuts down the power to its 12 volt socket. When the power shuts down, swap out the drained batteries with charged batteries. Insert the drained batteries into smart chargers (of the same make and model) and they will tell you if any of the individual batteries are degraded. Replace any number of degraded batteries with good batteries. The degradation problems are resolved, not masked.Why are we willing to let you quickly replace drained batteries with charged batteries rather then taking the pack off line to accommodate hours of (pack plug-in pack) recharging? Why do we enable you to detect and replace degraded batteries? Because, it’s not our job to sell batteries, whether or not those batteries are packed into packs. It’s not our job to sell you multiple packs, to overcome recharge times and degraded batteries.We consider it our job to enable you to build a battery and smart charger inventory which best meets your needs.We consider it our job to ensure you have safe access to power almost any where and almost any time.During our SlingIt application tests:
Six 3500 mAh batteries energized a WOW 2160 lumen LED work light for over 3 hours.
Six 3500 mAh batteries recharged a lower capacity internal mobile phone battery 7x (from 0% to 100%).
Six 3500 mAh batteries energized 1 of the water pumps we intend to deploy in our CleanIt water filtration system for over 5 hours.

Install Legion Solar virtually anywhere. 

 
Legion Solar is designed for anybody with any skill level to setup. It's that simple!      Legion Solar works with your existing rate program to simply drive your consumption down. The result is simply a lowered electric bill.   We created SolarRegulator™, an artificial intelligence computer to contain generated energy behind your meter where the utility company does not own. Energy production of each Micro-Inverter is controlled so that energy production is less than or equal to energy consumption allowing you to generate your own electricity unrestricted.  Utility company only sees less consumption from you, not a grid tied solar system. As a result, it is not necessary to seek interconnection permission pertaining to utility company approved grid-tied solar systems.  We took all the short comings of traditional solar systems and designed a game changing new solution to outperform.  As you become familiar with Legion Solar, size up your system in stages. The larger the system, the more you'll offset and the more you'll save.
Stage 1 - Get familiar with Legion Solar and it's components with the Starter Set. Sets up in minutes and experience instant results.
Stage 2 - Scale your solar output with expansion sets to offset your daytime usage.
Stage 3 - Once your system is large enough to have excess energy to store during daylight, add expansion sets with BatteryCommander™ for night time consumption.
Stage 4 - Add Off Grid Controller™ and an Off Grid Inverter so that you have emergency power during grid power outages.
  Bluetooth interface allows you to monitor your energy production and consumption, check system health, diagnostics and more via the LegionSolar App for Apple/Android. Try it for fee today.

<p>Christina Giudici runs FIMBY, a gardening business that helps people grow their own food. Bodie and Christina have <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1498620826/wekz0l9lkpfyupcf7i5p.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/>been friends and collaborators since they each started their businesses in Southern Tasmania around nine years ago.</p>
<p style=""text-align: right;""> </p>
<p>This project grew out of Christina's interest in making and using biochar, and Bodie's interest in pushing his business to be ever more sustainable.</p>
<p>Through conversations and shared enthusiasm, Bodie and Christina realised that perhaps they could combine these interests, by building a device that takes waste from Bodie's business, and produces biochar for use in gardening, soil and water management, effluent management, and many other uses.</p>
<p>A key player that enabled this project to become a reality is James Fox, a semi-retired process and chemical engineer with years of experience building coffee roasters, sawdust kilns, and biodiesel plants. James knows Bodie's business well, and understands pyrolysis, gasification and the intricacies of fabricating a machine to make this work. With Bodie and James's mechanical and process engineering heads together, they have designed a kiln that can use the sawdust and chipped offcuts from Bodie's Dovetail operation, capture the heat and gases for energy and drying timber, and produce biochar of reliable quality.</p>
<p>Christina already makes and uses biochar with her gardening clients, sharing the process of how to make biochar in an earth pit kiln at very little cost, other than time to collect materials and manage the burn. We love the simplicity of this process, and applaud and support the many people who are using open kilns to produce biochar for themselves and others.</p>
<p>But the opportunity of harnessing the waste wood at Bodie's operation can only be fully realised with a more industrial approach. Hence this project which automates and contains the pyrolysis reaction. <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1498543307/mpdobtanxutca5u25dqn.png"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/></p>
<p><strong>What is biochar?</strong></p>
<p>Biochar is a type of charcoal, but not the same sort that you’d use to cook a BBQ steak. Technically speaking, biochar is pyrolyzed organic material intended to be applied to soil for gardening or farming, or fed to animals.</p>
<p>It can also be used in building materials, insulation, absorption of pollutants, filtration, energy storage in batteries, and other industrial processes.</p>
<p><strong>What’s so special about it?</strong></p>
<p>Because of the huge surface area of biochar at a microscopic level, it is very good at absorbing air, water and soluble plant nutrients, like a sponge. In poor sandy soils this can be a big help in preventing valuable nutrients from being washed through the soil and lost below the root zone.</p>
<p>Biochar also acts like an electro-chemical sponge, and can adsorb and hold onto charged nutrients (eg cations like sulphate and phosphate), which again is helpful in poor soils with a low cation exchange capacity.</p>
<p>The porous stable structure of biochar also provides habitat for soil organisms, bacteria and fungi, which are essential for healthy soil and release of nutrients from decaying organic matter. The carbon structures in biochar are very long lived, and wont break down in decades or even centuries.</p>
<p>Biochar is not a fertiliser on its own. It can help make best use of any fertiliser that you apply to the soil. Trials conducted in Tasmania and all over the world have shown positive results in yield and quality of fruit and vegies from adding it to soil. Some trials have shown negative results too. If you add raw, fresh biochar to the soil that hasn’t been “charged” with nutrients, there can be negative effects in the short term, as the biochar binds with nutrients it finds in the soil and can make them unavailable to plants.</p>
<p>In trials with Christina's FIMBY clients in Tasmania, using biochar has proven beneficial in promoting plant growth and soil health in poor soils, most likely through holding water and nutrients. The prospect of being able to access plentiful biochar at a reasonable cost is exciting, as this will make it accessible for people without the time or unloved biomass resources to make their own at the scale they would like.</p>
<p>There are many opportunities for biochar to be a valuable part of solutions to complex waste / nutrient problems, and this project can make enough biochar available for these applications to be realistically explored in Tasmania.</p>
<p><strong>A model to be replicated</strong></p>
<p>If we are able to engage the help we need to fabricate and put the kiln together, we can prove the concept of this mid-level technology approach. We hope that others will do the same in other places, and are happy to share what we learn as we continue on this journey.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We've already put in all the design work for this sophisticated beast. We need $50,000 more to bring it to reality. Our budget is broken up like this:</p>
<p>$22,000 for materials (bits of machinery, engines, re-purposed parts of other industrial plant);</p>
<p>$18,000 for fabrication of metal components that don't exist already in some form;</p>
<p>$10,000 for installing and commissioning the kiln on site, and tinkering so that it works.</p>
<p>If we exceed our target, we can upscale our design, make more biochar, and sequester more carbon, of course. We will also put any additional funds into testing and certification, refine the design to extract more valuable products, eg wood vinegar, and research ways to use biochar to help solve some tricky problems. For example in Tassie we have some high nutrient effluent that is currently causing environmental damage. This could become an assett with the right application of biochar and intelligence.</p>
<p>If we don't reach our target, we'll build something - the minimum ""junk-engineered"" version that we need to be able to produce biochar. It probably wont be automated, nor quite as clever, but it will allow us to get started towards what we really have in mind.</p>
<p>To entice you to contribute, we have some delicious perks! For Tassie people, you can of course get yourself some lovely biochar for your garden or animal systems. We can make it straight and clean, or nutrient enriched, depending on your needs. You can also book us for a workshop / demonstration at your place to show you how to make your own biochar, low-tech style, and how best to use it in your compost, garden, or chook system.</p>
<p>If you're a gardener keen to save your back, or have a sunny courtyard that you'd love to make more productive, we're offering Bodie's gorgeous Dovetail Timber garden beds, which can be delivered to you where-ever you are. These will include a wicking bed kit, to save water and boost productivity.</p>
<p>If you're keen to talk to the engineers about the biochar kiln design and build, we're offering coaching sessions, in person or by skype, so that you can get going on your own version.</p>
<p>There's plenty more on offer: garden consultations, seasonal gardening calendars, beautiful garden-y artwork, beeswax wraps, and more. Or if you have a brilliant idea for a perk that you'd love to see, get in touch!</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Everybody loves a good closed loop system, where the outputs from one element are the inputs for another. That's what we're trying to do here, with the end game being to sequester carbon in the soil for the long term.</p>
<p>The system that we're designing for is a sawmilling / wood manufacturing business, that uses salvaged and low quality logs as its input. We take the waste from that process, and stabilise the carbon into biochar, capturing the heat energy and gases as we go. The carbon, as biochar, after various cascading uses, will end up in soil, rather than as CO2 from eventual decomposition of the sawdust and offcuts. Using forests to create biochar does not necessarily result in net carbon sequestration. But using a waste product from a process that itself uses salvaged materials - that's a win.</p>
<p>If you're tempted to hit that ""offset your carbon"" button when you book flights, we're offering an alternative way to offset your carbon footprint. You're contribution will be helping set up something that will keep evolving, and keep adding value while it sequesters carbon long term.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>This project is has its challenges. We have a design, but will it really work in the way that we imagine? We're pretty confident that it will, based on all of James and Bodie's experience and deep understanding of managing temperature, oxygen levels, duration and flow in a pyrolysis system. But we are not exactly copying an existing model, even though there are many and varied gasifiers and pyrolysis units out there. It might require some tinkering to get it running smoothly. So we've allowed plenty of time in our schedule for that.</p>
<p>We're also aiming to eventually have our biochar certified under the European Biochar Certificate (EBC). We've designed the process to tick all the boxes, but we wont know for certain till we produce some outputs and get them sampled and tested if we will meet the key criteria for the EBC.

</div></div>","Bodie Cavanagh runs Dovetail Timbers, a timber salvage business that makes dovetail cabins, garden beds and chook houses from salvaged wood.
Christina Giudici runs FIMBY, a gardening business that helps people grow their own food. Bodie and Christina have been friends and collaborators since they each started their businesses in Southern Tasmania around nine years ago.
 
This project grew out of Christina's interest in making and using biochar, and Bodie's interest in pushing his business to be ever more sustainable.
Through conversations and shared enthusiasm, Bodie and Christina realised that perhaps they could combine these interests, by building a device that takes waste from Bodie's business, and produces biochar for use in gardening, soil and water management, effluent management, and many other uses.
A key player that enabled this project to become a reality is James Fox, a semi-retired process and chemical engineer with years of experience building coffee roasters, sawdust kilns, and biodiesel plants. James knows Bodie's business well, and understands pyrolysis, gasification and the intricacies of fabricating a machine to make this work. With Bodie and James's mechanical and process engineering heads together, they have designed a kiln that can use the sawdust and chipped offcuts from Bodie's Dovetail operation, capture the heat and gases for energy and drying timber, and produce biochar of reliable quality.
Christina already makes and uses biochar with her gardening clients, sharing the process of how to make biochar in an earth pit kiln at very little cost, other than time to collect materials and manage the burn. We love the simplicity of this process, and applaud and support the many people who are using open kilns to produce biochar for themselves and others.
But the opportunity of harnessing the waste wood at Bodie's operation can only be fully realised with a more industrial approach. Hence this project which automates and contains the pyrolysis reaction. 
What is biochar?
Biochar is a type of charcoal, but not the same sort that you’d use to cook a BBQ steak. Technically speaking, biochar is pyrolyzed organic material intended to be applied to soil for gardening or farming, or fed to animals.
It can also be used in building materials, insulation, absorption of pollutants, filtration, energy storage in batteries, and other industrial processes.
What’s so special about it?
Because of the huge surface area of biochar at a microscopic level, it is very good at absorbing air, water and soluble plant nutrients, like a sponge. In poor sandy soils this can be a big help in preventing valuable nutrients from being washed through the soil and lost below the root zone.
Biochar also acts like an electro-chemical sponge, and can adsorb and hold onto charged nutrients (eg cations like sulphate and phosphate), which again is helpful in poor soils with a low cation exchange capacity.
The porous stable structure of biochar also provides habitat for soil organisms, bacteria and fungi, which are essential for healthy soil and release of nutrients from decaying organic matter. The carbon structures in biochar are very long lived, and wont break down in decades or even centuries.
Biochar is not a fertiliser on its own. It can help make best use of any fertiliser that you apply to the soil. Trials conducted in Tasmania and all over the world have shown positive results in yield and quality of fruit and vegies from adding it to soil. Some trials have shown negative results too. If you add raw, fresh biochar to the soil that hasn’t been “charged” with nutrients, there can be negative effects in the short term, as the biochar binds with nutrients it finds in the soil and can make them unavailable to plants.
In trials with Christina's FIMBY clients in Tasmania, using biochar has proven beneficial in promoting plant growth and soil health in poor soils, most likely through holding water and nutrients. The prospect of being able to access plentiful biochar at a reasonable cost is exciting, as this will make it accessible for people without the time or unloved biomass resources to make their own at the scale they would like.
There are many opportunities for biochar to be a valuable part of solutions to complex waste / nutrient problems, and this project can make enough biochar available for these applications to be realistically explored in Tasmania.
A model to be replicated
If we are able to engage the help we need to fabricate and put the kiln together, we can prove the concept of this mid-level technology approach. We hope that others will do the same in other places, and are happy to share what we learn as we continue on this journey.

What We Need & What You Get
We've already put in all the design work for this sophisticated beast. We need $50,000 more to bring it to reality. Our budget is broken up like this:
$22,000 for materials (bits of machinery, engines, re-purposed parts of other industrial plant);
$18,000 for fabrication of metal components that don't exist already in some form;
$10,000 for installing and commissioning the kiln on site, and tinkering so that it works.
If we exceed our target, we can upscale our design, make more biochar, and sequester more carbon, of course. We will also put any additional funds into testing and certification, refine the design to extract more valuable products, eg wood vinegar, and research ways to use biochar to help solve some tricky problems. For example in Tassie we have some high nutrient effluent that is currently causing environmental damage. This could become an assett with the right application of biochar and intelligence.
If we don't reach our target, we'll build something - the minimum ""junk-engineered"" version that we need to be able to produce biochar. It probably wont be automated, nor quite as clever, but it will allow us to get started towards what we really have in mind.
To entice you to contribute, we have some delicious perks! For Tassie people, you can of course get yourself some lovely biochar for your garden or animal systems. We can make it straight and clean, or nutrient enriched, depending on your needs. You can also book us for a workshop / demonstration at your place to show you how to make your own biochar, low-tech style, and how best to use it in your compost, garden, or chook system.
If you're a gardener keen to save your back, or have a sunny courtyard that you'd love to make more productive, we're offering Bodie's gorgeous Dovetail Timber garden beds, which can be delivered to you where-ever you are. These will include a wicking bed kit, to save water and boost productivity.
If you're keen to talk to the engineers about the biochar kiln design and build, we're offering coaching sessions, in person or by skype, so that you can get going on your own version.
There's plenty more on offer: garden consultations, seasonal gardening calendars, beautiful garden-y artwork, beeswax wraps, and more. Or if you have a brilliant idea for a perk that you'd love to see, get in touch!

The Impact
Everybody loves a good closed loop system, where the outputs from one element are the inputs for another. That's what we're trying to do here, with the end game being to sequester carbon in the soil for the long term.
The system that we're designing for is a sawmilling / wood manufacturing business, that uses salvaged and low quality logs as its input. We take the waste from that process, and stabilise the carbon into biochar, capturing the heat energy and gases as we go. The carbon, as biochar, after various cascading uses, will end up in soil, rather than as CO2 from eventual decomposition of the sawdust and offcuts. Using forests to create biochar does not necessarily result in net carbon sequestration. But using a waste product from a process that itself uses salvaged materials - that's a win.
If you're tempted to hit that ""offset your carbon"" button when you book flights, we're offering an alternative way to offset your carbon footprint. You're contribution will be helping set up something that will keep evolving, and keep adding value while it sequesters carbon long term.

Risks & Challenges
This project is has its challenges. We have a design, but will it really work in the way that we imagine? We're pretty confident that it will, based on all of James and Bodie's experience and deep understanding of managing temperature, oxygen levels, duration and flow in a pyrolysis system. But we are not exactly copying an existing model, even though there are many and varied gasifiers and pyrolysis units out there. It might require some tinkering to get it running smoothly. So we've allowed plenty of time in our schedule for that.
We're also aiming to eventually have our biochar certified under the European Biochar Certificate (EBC). We've designed the process to tick all the boxes, but we wont know for certain till we produce some outputs and get them sampled and tested if we will meet the key criteria for the EBC. These are:
Feedstock: organic waste, non toxic, from sustainable sources, small distances for transport. Yep, big time!
Production method: managing fluctuation in temperature during pyrolysis, no fossil fuels used in pyrolysis, gases trapped or cleanly burned, heat used or recycled. Absolutely!
Properties of the biochar: carbon content, nutrient content, heavy metal content threshold, volatile organic compound quantity, pH, bulk density, ash content, polyaromatic hydrocarbons and so on must meet certain criteria. We reckon so, will need to confirm by testing.
Handling and use: fire and dust suppression plans, transport at known moisture content, health and safety warnings and information. Yes, all is planned for this.
We will be working hard to manage all the parameters so that we can proudly say we're certified to a high standard.

</div><p> </p></div>","SolarGaps | Photovoltaic Solar Panel Window BlindsReduce your apartment, home and/or business electricity bill by up to 70% with solar energy generating smart blinds.
 
We engineered SolarGaps with features designed for renters, homeowners and businesses to affordably reduce energy usage, create renewable energy and make the transition to energy independence:

DIY PLUG & PLAY - With apartment renters in mind, the interior wall brackets are designed as a non-permanent, plug & play solution with additional installation options for homeowners to maximize energy production.

ENERGY GENERATING - Built-in solar panels can generate up to 100W-150W of renewable energy per 10 sq. ft. (≈ 1 m2) of a window, enough to power 30 LED light bulbs or three MacBooks. 

ENERGY REDUCING - In addition to generating solar energy, the window blinds also save energy by shading your home interior and reducing air condition cost by up to 80%. 

AFFORDABLE - Energy surplus can either be stored in the battery or can easily be sold to your electricity company as green energy through a two-way meter they provide. 

SMART FEATURES - Easily integrate with smart devices like Google Home, Echo, Nest Thermostat and more to control by voice, temperature and/or smartphone app. 
       The obvious solution for those who can't (renters) or don't want to install expensive rooftop solar panels.Check out the 30 second video above to see a quick overview of how SolarGaps works.  Have a look at some recent press and media reviews of the SolarGaps smart window shades:    ""One of those ideas that seems so obvious after you hear about it, because even 'dumb' window blinds can save a significant amount of energy"" -TREEHUGGER ""Solargaps have created their smart solar blinds to open the window to green energy for anyone and everyone"" - DESIGNBOOM ""If you are looking for relief from the heat and from a high electricity bill, this may just be the product for you"" - DIGITAL TRENDS ""SolarGaps actually has a shippable product ready with only a few differences from the final product they are promising if the campaign is successful"" - ANDROID AND ME ""On display here at Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, SolarGaps turns the actual slats of your window coverings into solar panels"" - CNET""Your windows become powerful with SolarGaps."" - Techcrunch     They're designed to look like traditional window blinds but they're smart and covered with photovoltaic modules. 
 SolarGaps are the world’s first renewable energy producing window blinds that use solar panels to create electricity to power your apartment, home or office.By replacing your current window treatments with solar energy producing window blinds, you can save up to 70% on your electric power bill allowing the SolarGaps to essentially pay for themselves over time. Yevgen Erik (founder) was in charge of building eco-friendly houses and installing blinds in office buildings when the idea of solar blinds came to him. 
""I spent one day in the fields outside of the city studying how the sunflowers followed the sun...then, I carried out research which proved that although solar modules are the cheapest among all other sources of energy, they are the most effective ones"" ~ Yevgen Erik
After researching the sun-tracking characteristics of the sunflower plant, Yevgen then experimented with ways to replicate the self-adjusting movements automatically in his blinds.  Not sure what option is right for you? Check out these tables.The photovoltaic cells generate electricity to power devices, store in a battery and/or sell to your electricity company.Outer facing photovoltaic solar panel cellsPhotovoltaic systems produce the most power during the day when the demand and price for electricity is higher. Once installed over a window (inside or outside), the smart blinds with built-in solar panels can generate up to 100W of energy per 10 sq. ft. (≈ 1 m2) of a window, which is enough to power 30 LED light bulbs or three MacBooks.For example, a three-room apartment with four windows of 2 sq.m. (about 20 sq. ft.) each facing south may be able to produce on average 7 kWh a day / 210 kWh a month assuming average daylight of 8.5 hours a day. In an office or retail space you can generate up to 10 times more.  Will you consume, store, or sell your power? Any energy surplus that's generated can either be stored in a battery or sold to the utility grid allowing you to take advantage of peak loads and daily fluctuations in electricity usage.

Consume Energy - The included SolarGaps dock that allows you to charge and power devices within your home or office. 

Battery Storage - By storing surplus energy in a battery, you can reduce your energy bill by consuming stored energy during peak hours when rates are higher.

Sell To Grid - With a two-way meter from your utility company, you can sell your surplus energy by supplying it to the power grid during the day when the demand and price is higher.
     Intelligently designed window blinds that make your smart home even smarter.We have a variety of sizes ranging from Extra Small to Extra Large. SolarGaps is a part of ecosystem of IoT smart home devices allowing it to be controlled remotely, automatically, manually and more. Automatic & Self-AdjustingTo absorb as much solar energy as possible, SolarGaps automatically adjusts the angle of the panels to follow the sun’s position. 
You can setup SolarGaps to match your own schedule and needs. For example, the blinds can be setup to open automatically when you want to wake up, or close at a predetermined time.
SolarGaps can even open automatically when someone enters a room to keep your house bright inside.
 iOS and Android AppOpen and close your blinds remotely from anywhere in the world allowing you to ensure privacy, protect from weather and/or create automations.
With the internet connected app, SolarGaps can utilize information such as weather forecast to generate energy more efficiently.
SolarGaps connects to our app via WiFi or Bluetooth allowing for basic controls to raise or lower the blinds, change the angle, and display how much energy is being generated.
 Internet of ThingsWith the SolarGaps app you can integrate directly with Google Home to enable voice controlled commands to open, close, etc.CNET coverd the Google Home & Nest Thermostat integrations at the 2017 Consumer Electronics Show.
 
Additional IoT integrations with smart devices like Ecobee, SmartThings, Philips Hue, etc could be potentials 'stretch goals' based on your feedback, funding levels and demand.
 SolarGaps integrates with Google Home and Amazon Echo to enable voice controlled commands, as well as Nest Thermostat to allow your blinds to adjust lighting to heat or cool your home naturally. 
     Install SolarGaps inside or outside, the choice is yours.

Simply mount SolarGaps on the wall over your window using the brackets provided or install them on the outside of your home.
Then plug SolarGaps into a power outlet and lower your energy bills by feeding electricity back to the grid. Any energy surplus can either be stored in batteries or be sold to your power utility.

DIY installation - You can install SolarBlinds yourself by following our simple instructions. Just mount SolarGaps on the wall over your window using the brackets provided. We recommend you install SolarGaps outside for better efficiency (up to 100-150 Wh in an hour per 10 sq. ft.). When installed inside, the amount of power generation is reduced.

Durable - The outer shell of SolarGaps is made out of a very strong and durable aluminum. Tested with an air gun, SolarGaps is unmatched on the market today when it comes to protecting your windows from poor weather conditions (e.g. storms, etc.). Built for all climates, SolarGaps can operate perfectly in the wide range of temperatures – between -40 and + 176 degrees Fahrenheit (-40 and +80 degrees Celsius). SolarGaps uses durable, high quality solar cells, best value on the market today. 

Custom - designed to fit a broad range of windows. We have a variety of sizes ranging from Extra Small to Extra Large. If you're interested in custom sizing, send us a message! We're here to cater to your specific needs.

<p><strong>Short Summary</strong></p>
<p>We started Green Path Technology to design and produce innovative products for the residential Solar market. After spending several years selling, designing and installing conventional PV systems, panels and micro inverters on the roof, we identified opportunities for system and process improvements. Namely: cost, form factor and efficiency improvements were identified as ways to improve the systems available to homeowners and renters alike.</p>
<p>My background is engineering. I have a master’s degree in electrical engineering and over 20 years of product design experience. My partner and wife has a degree in accounting and has well over 20 years of experience in sales and marketing. We both felt compelled to try to make improvements to PV systems with respect to the homeowner's needs. The Joule Power Tree is the result of over 3 years of development and testing the mechanical and electrical systems that make up the whole Joule Renewable System . We are proud and excited to launch this Indiegogo campaign to get started with the production of the Joule Power Tree and get it into service with homeowners and renters all over the world. </p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>The funding that we receive from our backers in exchange for the perks will be used to purchase capital equipment, rent a production facility and to hire a manufacturing team. Some of the capital equipment needed includes equipment associated with the assembly and testing of solar products such as encapsulation and lamination equipment and PV panel power output testers. We also use FMD (3D) printers to produce a number of the components of the Joule Power Tree so we’ll need to acquire several more FDM printers for the production of the Tree.</p>
<p>To show our appreciation to the backers for supporting us, we are offering Joule Power Tree perks. We will offer 4 different models of the Tree with different features:</p>
<p> </p>
<ol>
<li>Model 500 w/o Batteries:          500 Watts (5kWh/day), no batteries</li>
<li>Model 500 w Batteries:              500 Watts (5kWh/day), 1000wh Batteries</li>
<li>Model 1000 w/o Batteries:        1000 Watts (10kWh/day), no batteries</li>
<li>Model 1000 w Batteries:            1000 Watts (10kWh/day), 1000wh Batteries</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
<ol><li>Production processes risks. The biggest risk to the timely delivery of the perks, the Joule Power Tree, to our backers is the development and success of a production process to produce the many components of the tree. Just as a real tree has many, many leaves, the Joule Power Tree has many, many solar cell leaves. While we have successfully produced many leaves to date and have contracted manufacturing from outside of our company to mass produce the leaves, the challenge still remains to produce the leaves in great quantity, with high quality and at a cost that will keep us competitive. We are qualified to overcome this particular challenge because of our strong ties to companies in the manufacturing industry specific to PCB and PCB assembly. We have already approached several build-to-print manufacturers to provide us with quotations and methods of manufacturing that look extremely favorable and promising, but not yet proven.</li></ol>
<ol>
<li value=""2"">Materials acquisition risks. The second biggest risk to timely delivery of the product is the risk associated with the procurement of the materials needed to produce the Joule Power Tree with short lead-times and at a price that will keep the cost of the Joule Power Tree low. The Joule Power Tree units that have been produced to date use components that were purchased from vendors that stock the items and offer the value-add to their customers of timely deliver, but at a substantial cost. We need to seek out vendors that will deliver quickly and allow us to take advantages of cost savings realized by economies of scale. While this is a challenge, we are qualified to solve this problem also by use of our network of manufacturing partners. We intend to leverage our relationships fostered over the years with manufacturing companies and their procurement departments to help us find vendors that can and will deliver the materials necessary for the mass production of the Joule Power Tree.</li>
<li value=""3"">Manufacturing Team Assembly Risks. The third and final risk to the delivery of the perks to our backers is the risk of finding good help. It will take time to spin-up a work force to build the Joule Power Tree once the production processes are in place. We will again rely on our network of manufacturers to assist us with this effort. We have made plans to seek out the facility in a familiar city and where we know many capable and willing workers to get this activity off the ground. </li>

We have made plans to seek out the facility in a familiar city and where we know many capable and willing workers to get this activity off the ground.

With a 5KWH battery system, Vulcan provides 4.575KWH vs. 4.25KWH for 85% inverters and 4KWH for 80% inverters. <strong>Higher efficiency equals hours or days more power when you need it most.</strong></p><p> </p><h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>How Does Vulcan Compare to Permanent Installation Systems?</strong></h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1620399907/fwokgojyozka2q21u36d.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1616778049/jnonnltk5hb7ypqut912.png"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1615472848/npop14xqjsfywgru25ts.png"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1616087322/xjzusc7b9brq8issobor.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h3 style=""text-align: center;""> </h3><h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Inverter-Charger</strong></h3><h3 style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1617829883/qvxvqpgdxuyjmfj4lz0e.jpg"" src="""" style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;""/></h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1617829998/cv3wifa0h7sqjfy0tyy6.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1616087340/svs7byw8detr8boxcyq6.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h3 style=""text-align: center;""> </h3><h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Energy Store </strong></h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1617830073/ysyraynv0qmsyjwf6s9q.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h3 style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1617897218/bxszdulexyd7q627vcur.jpg"" src=""""/></h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1616087359/k3ys8qkaz33u7b885lbl.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1615473560/szpyftaxp4t5ev8mtqym.png"" src=""""/></p><p>Unlike the myriad of other portable energy product providers who are resellers/drop shippers, our Sol Donum team members are the actual Vulcan designers and manufacturers and are here in the States.

It is a powerful alternative to permanent installation storage batteries and gasoline generators in a portable and fully recyclable package.Vulcan fits your lifestyle to store energy to power your electrical needs 24/7 for days or weeks on a single charge - whether you’re in a house, condo, apartment, RV, or live off-grid.We invite you to back us to help manufacture the Vulcan, create more American jobs, and create carbon-free and recyclable energy systems for U.S. and international consumers, businesses, and governments. Exclusive to our INDIEGOGO backers, we are offering a 10-year limited warranty!Reliable grid power is not guaranteed — Our nation’s electricity grid is prone to aging equipment, capacity bottlenecks, and increased demand, as well as storm and climate impacts. Americans will likely experience longer and more frequent power interruptions from events such as wildfires and storms like the ones that caused the California and Texas blackouts. Gain 24/7 energy security and independence with the Vulcan high power and high energy storage system to keep the lights on at all times.Much more than a battery — Using top-of-the-line inverter, solar charger, power control, AC/DC charger, and battery technologies — Vulcan is an unparalleled electric power source for all your AC loads while at home, working, traveling, or living off-grid.Two ways of charging — A 4KWH or 5KWH Vulcan system can be recharged with 1200W of solar, 720W of AC, or both simultaneously for up to 1920W combined. Adding more units increases the amount of solar and AC inputs available to keep charging times low and constant. Safe & easy battery backup power — Provide a continuous supply of clean power to protect your home, business, hospital, or school if the main power goes out. No need for gas generators that produce dangerous emissions and require regular maintenance. Not all power coming from the grid is safe for you to use. When the grid is overloaded and brownouts occur, voltage drops can ruin your computer and other electronic devices. Our built-in AC filters clean the 120V AC output and allow you to operate sensitive electronics under any power conditions and even works in line with gasoline generators as a multi-source energy system.Home utility cost reduction — Depending on your utility rate structure, peak demand charges can represent a significant portion of home utility bills. The Vulcan can be used to automatically power critical home loads during peak hours to lower the cost of your electric bill. Efficient home solar storage — If you are considering installing solar panels, pair them with the Vulcan and plug them directly into Vulcan’s native solar panel connectors. If you already have solar panels installed, Vulcan can be AC coupled to store excess energy generated by solar panels for later use or when more electricity is needed (evenings and cloudy days). Use a generator transfer switch with our built-in 30A automatic transfer switch (ATS) to wire Vulcan into your house breaker panel or subpanel. This will automatically keep critical circuits operating during blackouts without manual intervention. Working, traveling, or living remotely off-grid — The Vulcan is dust, moisture, weather, and corrosion resistant to operate under harsh conditions across a wide temperature range (-4F to +122F). Our easy plug-and-play system allows you to power anything that you normally power with a 120V AC outlet while you are on the go and provides many convenient ways to quickly recharge using AC and Solar Panel inputs. Our Faraday shielding protects against radio frequency (RF) interference and electromagnetic pulses (EMP), making this also an ideal solution for shelters and bunkers and for operating sensitive radio equipment. Power to run your home - Multiple system configurations can be created to run your appliances and critical electrical needs for days or weeks. Tie another Vulcan into a base 5KWH system and get 6.4KWH of battery storage along with higher charging capacity and 4KW of continuous 120V AC to power more appliances and for longer. Vulcan propels the adoption of solar & renewable energy sources, a must for reversing climate change. Vulcan’s modular and expandable design will give you carbon-free, quiet backup power without the need for a gas generator. If you already have a gas generator, our Vulcan system easily integrates with your existing generator, allowing you to limit the noise, reduce fuel consumption, reduce carbon emissions and minimize wear and tear on your generator.Daisy chain units for more power — Whatever 120V AC appliances you need to power, you can rely on the Vulcan system to meet your needs. Our power cable sets allow for easy expansion within seconds.Efficiency matters — Not all inverters work alike or are created equally. Having a big battery is of little benefit if the inverter that converts the battery energy to 120V AC operates at low efficiency. Vulcan inverters are industrial grade and operate at 91.5% efficiency. Lower-cost energy generators operate at 80% - 85% efficiency or lower. With a 5KWH battery system, Vulcan provides 4.575KWH vs. 4.25KWH for 85% inverters and 4KWH for 80% inverters. Higher efficiency equals hours or days more power when you need it most. How Does Vulcan Compare to Permanent Installation Systems?   Inverter-Charger Energy Store  Unlike the myriad of other portable energy product providers who are resellers/drop shippers, our Sol Donum team members are the actual Vulcan designers and manufacturers and are here in the States.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I, Karen Pare' (Bressner),  am the inventor of the Modular Wind Turbine System (MWTS) which I have been working on for over 15 years. I have two patents and one pending.  In this time, I have completed many studies on this system through a Computer Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and wind tunnel tests at RPI which have all come back positive.   </p>
<p>Currently, I am a director of a new company called  WSP Wind Energy, that was formed in April of 2020 with a major investor committed to investing $1 million to complete the Beta 2 unit. Beta 2 is scheduled to begin construction in 2021 at a NREL/Government sponsored test site in Utah. Engineering is complete on the components and quotes are coming in, but the delays this past year due to COVID-19 and major price increases have put a strain on the operating budget, and funds for daily operations will fall short before construction.</p>
<p>Since, I've invested all my available funds into the development of the technology, I am reaching out to my family, friends, and the public for help in raising funds.  I know it’s a lot to ask but every little bit helps.  We currently, have submitted for grants as well, but most have a long waiting period..  A minimum of $300,000 would help the shortfall, but $500,000 would provide a safety net. Anyone interested in becoming a major shareholder can email me directly.</p>
<p>This Beta 2 will be a full 3 layer system and upon completion and operation, it will be able to become certified, allowing us to go to market. Our system is consistent with the current market price for small wind turbines, and we are already reserving units for 2022 with an estimate of $5.5 million in sales.</p>
<p>This system is not like any wind turbine currently on the market and has the potential of changing the industry. Please consider contributing to help reduce our carbon footprint.</p>

<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
</div><div>
<p>The modular wind turbine system can be customized without changing fabrication techniques. This allows the system to enter the end-user location where medium and large conventional turbine towers cannot gain access. Think of manufacturers and businesses having a means to reduce their carbon footprint.</p>
<p>This system uses the Bernoulli Principle to accelerate and groom the wind, the energy output is cubed, which also allows us to produce more energy in less square footage than a conventional system.</p>
<p>Two equations are vital in understanding and constructing wind turbine generators:</p>
<p>(1) The power output of a wind generator is proportional to the area swept by the rotor - double the sweep area and the power output will also double. (Formula for prop-on-pole)</p>
<p>(2) The power output of a wind generator is proportional to the cube of the wind speed - double the wind speed and the power output will increase by a factor of eight (2 x 2 x 2). By accelerating the wind speed we cube our energy output, which allows us to produce more energy in less square footage than a conventional system. This is how the MWTS works.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Our biggest risk is not funding our operational budget in time for construction. Our team is working every avenue to raise funds but with many new innovations and startups, it's tough.  Once the unit is up and sales are contracted, financing is available.  We are fully insured.</p>

</div></div>","Day in, day out, your shower never changes. It gets the job done, and you’ve never given it a second thought. But what if it could evolve? What if your shower became an elevated experience that cleansed you faster, more efficiently and with cleaner water?Don’t stop there – let’s say it also used 75% less water. This is Cirrus, an innovative new shower system that introduces water-atomizing CloudMaker technology to bring you luxurious sensations, water savings, 13x more thermal efficiency and 10x more surface area coverage.By turning your shower into a pressurized mist, Cirrus envelops your entire body in a cocoon of warmth. With a deluge of atomized water increasing surface area coverage 10-fold, every inch of your hair and skin is cleansed faster and more efficiently – while using drastically less water than a standard showerhead.For the average household this 75% water reduction translates to over 15,000 Gallons of water saved per year. Not only does this mean that Cirrus pays for itself in less than 2 years – but the reduction of a Cirrus household’s environmental impact on water reserves is massive.To push this industry innovation further, we built easily replaceable NanoFIlters into the Cirrus Core. These filters contain 3 layers of mineralized stones to filter impurities, reduce chlorine, and balance pH levels for a truly pure shower experience.For complete invigoration, relaxation and well-being, choose from our aromatherapy NanoFilter blends infused with organic essential oils.The best part? Cirrus is universal to any bathroom. Installation takes seconds – no tools, no complex directions, no hassle.Cirrus is here to revolutionize your shower. Be embraced by the misty deluge of Cirrus CloudMaker technology the moment you enter your shower. Every inch of skin is engulfed by water, warming tired achy muscles and drenching hair in seconds.When shower time becomes an all-new hydrotherapeutic experience, you won’t want to leave. And with such incredible water efficiency, you don’t have to. Cirrus takes away the guilt (and cost) of long, steamy showers by reducing water consumption by a massive 75%.A Cirrus shower will invigorate your mind, freshen your body and sharpen your senses to tackle the day head. And at nighttime, it will soothingly warm and relax every muscle in your body for a sleep that’s deep and healingTake a look at the difference between Cirrus and a typical showerhead… The nozzle of a standard showerhead shoots a jet stream of water – the majority of which is wasted down the drain. With Cirrus, water is pushed through the CloudMaker nozzle, which disperses every particle into a fine, pressurized mist.With this dispersion, every droplet of water is fully optimized. The result? A showerhead that covers 10x more surface area while being 13x more thermally efficient than the standard model.       Just as important as water usage, there’s another factor that goes into the high cost of your shower: Heat. In a standard shower, only a mere 3% of the thermal energy used to heat your water is actually transferred to your body and the surrounding air. Where does the rest of that 97% go? Straight down the drain (along with your money). With Cirrus, the water is dispersed into millions of tiny droplets rather than a single stream. With a larger amount of individual droplets yielding a larger water surface area, more heat is efficiently transferred to the air as the droplets fall.This means that Cirrus transfers 13 times more thermal energy from your warm water to both you and the air around you, decreasing the amount of heat required to shower.The water dispersion and thermal efficiency of the Cirrus showerhead saves you money on your water bill and your heating bill. Foamy shampoo and body lather doesn’t stand a chance. Defying all expectations, Cirrus is capable of rinsing soapy hair and skin more efficiently than a regular showerhead. Despite using 75% less water, the fully optimized mist covers every inch of your body, permeates every strand of hair and flushes away soap with ease. The ultimate shower experience wouldn’t be complete without pure, filtered water. Since Cirrus is all about revolutionizing the way you shower, it was obvious that we needed a new, innovative filtration system.    The Cirrus water-purifying NanoFilters contain 3 layers of mineralized stones that work to transform your tap water.• Tourmaline stones balance pH levels• Far-Infrared stones filter water impurities such as chlorine, dirt and bacteria• Germanium stones give a natural spring water effect for softer, cleaner, more hydrated skin Unwanted particles in your tap water may be the culprit for dry skin and damaged hair. As water flows through the fine pores of the mineralized stones, these large excess particles are filtered out. This simple yet effective method of filtration mimics the process of nature and fresh free-flowing springs, leaving your shower water pure. The result? Softer, cleaner skin and a longer lifetime for your showerhead.Our NanoFilter pods are simple and easy to replace. You’ll know exactly when their time is up thanks to an indicator located directly on the cartridge, which shows it’s remaining lifetime. On average, each NanoFilter will last between 2 to 3 months based on a household of 4.The Cirrus Core and NanoFilters are designed to function separately from the Cirrus showerhead. This means you can use the Core in conjunction with any standard showerhead in your home for a cleaner, more pure shower.On the other hand, if you don’t want to use the Core for water filtration or aromatherapy but still want the luxurious experience and water savings of Cirrus, you can opt to use the Cirrus showerhead on its own.Essential oils gleaned from various plants have been used for thousands of years in cultures around the world to relieve everything from headache to depression. Now, you can bring the curative properties of aromatherapy into your shower.  It’s like having a spa in your own home. Not only does the Cirrus core contain water-purifying NanoFilters – it can also house one of our curated essential oil blends to invigorate your mind and body.Equipped with the same water-filtering technology as their non-aromatic cousins, water flows through the purifying stones and disperses the scent of therapeutic oils throughout your shower. These organic essential oils are colorless and soap-free, meaning they won’t color your water or perfume your body. Each single-use aromatherapy cartridge lasts for approximately 8 minutes of blissful showertime.Step into a warm cocoon of water and let the aromatic mist envelop you. Do you desire a sharp, exciting blend that energizes you and focuses your mind for the day ahead? Or a relaxing mixture of calming scents and muscle-soothing oils for a deep and luxurious sleep?Choose from our range of 6 essential oil infusers, expertly blended by aromatherapists of France.• Calming (Lavender and Bergamot): Stress relief, healing, relaxation, pain relief, sleep aid• Desire (Orange and Cinnamon): Energy boost, immune system, digestion• Forest (Lime and Cedar): Stress relief, cold symptom relief, relaxation• Sunshine (Lime and Mint): Focus, energy boost, invigoration, immune system• PureShape (Lavender and Geranium): Relaxation, mood stabilization, stress relief, sleep aid• Passion (Geranium and Red Fruits): Relaxation, mood stabilization, immune system  Cirrus will revolutionize the way you shower – and look good doing it, too.Beautiful French design combines functionality with sleek, modern curves that illicit a futuristic feeling. The crisp white bottom and shining chrome top made of quality polycarbonate will add a high-concept aesthetic to any bathroom.Installation couldn’t be easier, either.Fixed by magnets, the showerhead support latches on to any shower wall in seconds and the ergonomic wand slides in effortlessly. When not in use, the wand fixes to the wall support at a 45-degree angle, magnetically held in place.

But, don’t you want that same luxury at home? Introducing Ranvoo, a minimalist yet high-performing towel warmer that not only turns your bath routine into a spa experience but also serves a ton of practical everyday uses.​Ranvoo dries your bath towel perfectlyRanvoo quickly dries and sanitizes your towels while keeping them easily accessible, creating a warm, healthy and comforting end to every bath or shower. It transcends seasons and locales to reduce damp and mildew on your towels and in a surrounding space. Besides towels, Ranvoo can be used to dry and disinfect delicate clothing, such as swimming suits, underwear, socks, pajamas, bath towel and much more.Unlike other electric or hydronic towel warmers that require a plumber or an electrician to install it, you can, all by yourself, firmly mount Ranvoo to the wall through the adhesive on its back, completely tool-free and drill-free. As a result, your entire family will enjoy the comfort, style and function provided by Ranvoo.A combination of hot air- and infrared-assisted drying methodRanvoo dries a towel in a mere 2 hours, 33% faster than other towel dryers.We conducted an experiment on the drying effect of Ranvoo in comparison to two other brands in the same condition. Three identical towels, wetted with the same amount of water on the same spot, were respectively hung on three different towel warmers which were turned on at the same time to start heating. The weight of each towel was recorded every 10 minutes until they were fully dried.Ranvoo uses carbon fiber as the electrical heating element​Infrared radiation of Ranvoo is immediate as soon as it is switched on.The temperature reaches over 140°F right after switching on the machineThe carbon fiber tube generates invisible far infrared rays that spread in a wide range across the towel, which also heat up the air moved by two centrifugal blowers on either end of the rack to a long distance. As a result of the combined drying efforts, the towel can be dehydrated far quicker by Ranvoo than other towel warmers.Monthly electricity cost in different states for using Ranvoo for 2 hours each dayRanvoo towel warmer removes humidity from your lifeRanvoo’s infrared radiation enables higher heating rates with lower energy consumption.Ranvoo’s dual heating technology takes a wide lead in terms of cost-effective efficiency and comfort. 
Ranvoo’s radiant heating, made more widely and evenly by the blowing hot air, does not heat the surrounding air, only those surfaces that the radiation hits, thus being more efficient.
As for other traditional towel warmers, mainly hydronic or electric, most of the heat is dissipated into the surrounding air instead of the surfaces of the towels.
Fancy a fresh and warm towel but scared off by the high electricity bill? With Ranvoo, the maximum cost is only $2 per month. By applying carbon fiber heating coils and the smart drying mechanism, the energy efficiency is improved to its greatest extent to save money and the environment.Dual disinfection effect of both hot air and UVC for the ultimate hygieneDiseases caused by bacteria and fungus of a damp towelRanvoo provides all-round protection for the health of your kidsBacteria on a damp towel are the culprit of bad smells and many annoying illnesses.

Consistency is one of the main struggles most people have with working out. It’s easy to become a victim of 'seasonal fitness',  'New Year, New Me', or 'Summer Body' and then revert to your old habits once the initial hype has ended.
The RE:GEN gives you fitness incentives like no other workout program. The Energym app empowers you to reach your fitness goals effortlessly with classes and personalised workouts. Sweatcoins reward you for exercising, and the bike captures the power you have created, helping you to directly positively impact your carbon footprint without completely changing how you live.Plus the bike is right at home! You never have to drive to the gym to get your workout in.Everytime you ride your RE:GEN, your Sweatcoin Wallet in the Energym app tracks how many sweatcoins you earn from your workout. You can spend your sweatcoins in the Energym Marketplace within the Energym App to redeem exclusive rewards and discounts on digital subscriptions, exercise gear, and much more!We all know working out has amazing benefits, but until now, it’s been a waste of energy.Before the RE:GEN, a lot of the energy exerted during exercise would be wasted as heat. You’d expend hundreds of hours exercising every year and get nothing tangible in return. With the RE:GEN, you can harness your own power and use it to charge your devices throughout the day.The Ohm stores the clean energy you generate during each workout so you can use it to charge your phone, laptop, toothbrush, and more!The Ohm battery is the size of a water bottle and holds up to 100Wh of clean energy.The LED lights transform into a live power meter that displays your Functional Threshold Power (FTP) while you ride. It has 500 watts of potential power with 2 built-in USB ports.For additional charging ports, you can add on a snap-on power extender that lets you charge up to 5 devices simultaneously​! The extender adds 3 USB-C outlets and 1 USB-A outlet, and you can use the USB-A outlet on the Ohm. We're also currently working on an AC inverter adapter you can connect to the Ohm to power appliances in the future, along with the ability to use it with your eBike. You can also add on a smaller battery unit called the Mini Ohm, for on-the-go power!  The RE:GEN measures Functional Threshold Power (FTP) which is the highest average power you can maintain for an hour measured in watts.Both the battery and app display a real-time visual power meter as you exercise. The battery’s LED display glows in a range of colours, according to what 'power zone' you’re in. This is custom to you and also changes as you get fitter over time!Your Workout Summary records data from every workout so you can see Active Minutes, Calories Burned, and Energy Generated! Have fun getting in shape with multiple games to choose from. We have a live battle mode and racing game that enables users to race around a track, throw resistance ‘shells’ and earn boosts, similar to Mario Kart. These “resistance shells” will affect other players’ resistance remotely!The sleek, matte black bike is only L 46.5”x W 20.5” x H 42”, more than 10 inches smaller than Peloton and 25 inches shorter than NordicTrack yet it still fits you perfectly. Put it in your office, bedroom or home gym without rearranging your entire home.Get in Shape at HomeWith RE:GEN in your home, you can get in the best shape of your life. You have no excuses. There’s no time wasted driving to the gym or missing your class, you can fit your workout in any time you’re at the house for 30 minutes.Generate Your Own Power During an OutageWhen there’s a storm or outage, you don’t have to worry. The RE:GEN makes you energy independent with the ability to power your essential devices just by riding. We’re also working on an A/C adapter so you’ll be able to power appliances with your Ohm Battery soon!Save Money on Power & PurchasesYou save money on your power bill by powering your devices with electricity generated from your workouts. You'll also save money on products you’d purchase anyway with our exclusive Sweatcoin rewards, available in the Energym Marketplace.Train for Your RacesGet time on the seat rain or shine. The RE:GEN is the perfect companion for road bikers looking to train at a more professional level. You’ll get seriously challenged on this bike and set yourself up for success on the road.Many people want to get in shape and are passionate about fighting climate change, they just don’t know where to begin. They can’t find the time to workout or they can’t stay consistent. They see the forest fires, dying reefs, and insurmountable ocean pollution, but they feel it’s too big to tackle or make a difference.Our mission at Energym is to empower you to be your healthiest and fight climate change from the comfort of your own home. Every time you workout on the RE:GEN, you improve your physical fitness and reduce your dependence on electricity generated by fossil fuels and natural gases.The energy you generate powers your home office for a day, but what about the collective energy of all RE:GEN riders? Could it power buildings or even cities? What if entire countries ran off their own recycled energy? That’s our goal at Energym and we’re excited for you to be a part of it.Take your seat in the race for our planet.New to Indiegogo? No problem. Follow these simple steps to get your own RE:GEN.At the end of the campaign, we’ll send you a survey to get your shipping information and deliver your RE:GEN when manufacturing is complete!International Buyers – Please Note: Import duties, taxes, and charges are not included in the item price or shipping cost.

<li><p><strong>Think recycle and compost -  A tube, manufactured from recycled paper, (in the United States) holds fresh loose leaf.  The lid is a measuring devise and the plastic plug keeps contents secure.  This product contains no filters or sachets, no paper, no box or cellophane, no staples or strings. </strong></p></li>

<p><strong>The core technology of NATEDE is phytoremediation</strong>, which means that it uses the natural power of common plants to clean toxins in the air. This was studied by NASA in the ’80s and implemented by Vitesy with almost 3 years of research at <strong>PNAT and LINV, two of the most important laboratories on plants neurobiology in the world.</strong> </p>

<p>Plants placed in NATEDE metabolize a significantly higher amount of pollutants as opposed to plants potted in regular vases given that the <strong>air purification process</strong> happens throughout the whole plant, including its roots.</p>
<p>NATEDE also features a <strong>new and improved technology</strong> unit that supercharges this effect.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1528449283/fv3bknt6xnqephnl990u.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>NATEDE combines <strong>phytoremediation</strong> with a new incredible filtration process: <strong>photocatalysis</strong>. </p>

<p>NATEDE's superpowers come from the so-called <strong>photocatalysis</strong>: light energy kick-starts a process that zaps all kinds of nasty air pollutants and turns them into harmless substances instead.</p>
<p><strong>For people who suffer from asthma and allergies</strong>, the NATEDE light-powered air purifier is a great ally to breathe clean air and improve your health.</p>
<p>The photocatalytic filter inside NATEDE can capture and eliminate VOCs, viruses and bacteria, and it can significantly alleviate odors from pets, cigarettes and cigars, cooking, mildew, etc.</p>
<p>And the best part of photocatalysis is that <strong>this filter does not need any replacement!</strong></p>

<p><strong>NATEDE’s technology has been scientifically tested</strong></p>
<h3><strong>PLANTS</strong></h3>
<p>It’s now more than 3 years that we have been testing our products and our technology. <strong>Our main partners are PNAT and LINV</strong>, the most prestigious research labs on plants neurobiology in Europe, both spin-offs of the University of Florence, Italy. PNAT and LINV proved the effectiveness of our system and work closely with us to improve our products.</p>

<h3><strong>FLUID DYNAMICS</strong></h3>
<p>After the success of our first Kickstarter campaign back in 2016, we started working with <strong>fluid dynamics engineers </strong>to perfect the airflow and to improve the purification range. NATEDE has an incredible purification range and guarantees a perfect and silent air flow.</p>

<h3><strong>PHOTOCATALYSIS</strong></h3>
<p>Photocatalysis is a natural process by which the light strikes a mineral (titanium dioxide - TiO₂ - a common mineral) and activates a chemical process that securely and instantaneously oxidizes and decomposes the organic matter at the molecular level to form water vapor and small parts of carbon dioxide. The <strong>combination of photocatalysis with the plant</strong> is just perfect and guarantees a great improvement in performance.</p>

<h3>FAQ</h3>
<p><strong>What is NATEDE?</strong></p>
<p>NATEDE by Vitesy is a natural air purifier that combines the power of nature and technology to eliminate indoor pollution and to analyse it.</p>
<p><strong>How does NATEDE work?</strong></p>
<p>NATEDE is a filtration system based on the principle of phytoremediation, which is a process that allows plants to concentrate elements and compounds from the environment and to metabolize various molecules in their tissue. The filtering system is supercharged by the presence of a technological unit within NATEDE that exponentially increases the passage of air through the plant, eliminating harmful substances and purifying the air. Moreover, it has e new photocatalytic filter, which does not need to be replaced, therefore eliminating waste and extra costs.</p>
<p><strong>What is a photocatalytic filter?</strong></p>
<p>Light energy kick-starts a process that zaps all kinds of nasty air pollutants and turns them into harmless substances. For people who suffer from asthma and allergies, light-powered air purifiers like these are another weapon in the fight for cleaner air and better health. You don’t have to replace it, just rinse it with water!</p>
<p><strong>What toxins and pollutants does NATEDE eliminate?</strong></p>
<p>NATEDE eliminates 93% of VOCs (Volatile Organic Compounds) including benzene, ammonia, formaldehyde; 99% of bacteria, virus and fine particulate. NATEDE also removes odors.</p>
<p><strong>What’s the main difference between NATEDE and a traditional flowerpot?</strong></p>
<p>Regular flowerpots block the air flow at the root level, while NATEDE amplifies the phytoremediation process.</p>
<p><strong>What is phytoremediation?</strong></p>

Following the incredible success of our 2016 Campaign, we are proud to present you: NATEDE by Vitesy.
NATEDE is your brand new incredible Smart and Natural Air Purifier. It will also be the most beautiful design object you will ever have for your home or office, and it's now available for pre-orders.


 


NATEDE is a beautiful Natural Air Purifier for any home or office, and behind its simple design it features a complex and innovative technology.
NATEDE has the most advanced sensors and it leverages a new photocatalytic filter, which does not need to be replaced, eliminating waste and extra expenses.Thanks to the combination of the plant with this innovative filter, this air purifier successfully eliminates 93% of VOCs, 99% of bacteria, viruses, fine-particulate and odors.
NATEDE works with its dedicated app that allows users to monitor air pollutants and control the air flow in their space in real time. NATEDE can even connect to other smart home devices.


""The most crowdfunded anti-pollution project ever!"" - Tom's Hardware ​
""Most air purifiers are bulky and loud, with no thought going into its aesthetic. NATEDE is loaded with complex technology, and it has a nice design so that you can proudly display it anywhere"" - Design Milk 







The monitors and sensors inside NATEDE can accurately measure the temperature and humidity of a room, as well as detect pollutants (VOCs), fine-particulates (PM2.5), and carbon monoxide (CO).
NATEDE Premium will also include an additional sensor for carbon dioxide (CO₂).


The new NATEDE mobile app (available for iOS and Android) allows users to monitor the air quality in their space. NATEDE connects to your home or office Wi-Fi, so you can manage NATEDE from everywhere. It features also Bluetooth, which makes the first connection and setup much easier.

NATEDE’s mobile app dashboard shows real-time monitoring of the IAQ (Internal Air Quality). The wave frequency changes depending on the IAQ levels.

From the mobile app it’s possible to manage NATEDE’s fan speed and select one of the four available operating modes.
It's also possible to see a detailed breakdown of the pollutants in your environment.

NATEDE’s app features a Statistics section where you can monitor the levels of the measured elements such as humidity, temperature, VOCs, PM2.5 and CO. Premium users will also be able to monitor CO₂ levels.


The core technology of NATEDE is phytoremediation, which means that it uses the natural power of common plants to clean toxins in the air. This was studied by NASA in the ’80s and implemented by Vitesy with almost 3 years of research at PNAT and LINV, two of the most important laboratories on plants neurobiology in the world. 



Plants placed in NATEDE metabolize a significantly higher amount of pollutants as opposed to plants potted in regular vases given that the air purification process happens throughout the whole plant, including its roots.
NATEDE also features a new and improved technology unit that supercharges this effect.

NATEDE combines phytoremediation with a new incredible filtration process: photocatalysis. 

NATEDE's superpowers come from the so-called photocatalysis: light energy kick-starts a process that zaps all kinds of nasty air pollutants and turns them into harmless substances instead.
For people who suffer from asthma and allergies, the NATEDE light-powered air purifier is a great ally to breathe clean air and improve your health.
The photocatalytic filter inside NATEDE can capture and eliminate VOCs, viruses and bacteria, and it can significantly alleviate odors from pets, cigarettes and cigars, cooking, mildew, etc.
And the best part of photocatalysis is that this filter does not need any replacement!





 
NATEDE’s technology has been scientifically tested
PLANTS
It’s now more than 3 years that we have been testing our products and our technology. Our main partners are PNAT and LINV, the most prestigious research labs on plants neurobiology in Europe, both spin-offs of the University of Florence, Italy. PNAT and LINV proved the effectiveness of our system and work closely with us to improve our products.
Results from 2016 PNAT/LINV analysis 
Additional 2017/2018 PNAT/LINV analysis
FLUID DYNAMICS
After the success of our first Kickstarter campaign back in 2016, we started working with fluid dynamics engineers to perfect the airflow and to improve the purification range. NATEDE has an incredible purification range and guarantees a perfect and silent air flow.

PHOTOCATALYSIS
Photocatalysis is a natural process by which the light strikes a mineral (titanium dioxide - TiO₂ - a common mineral) and activates a chemical process that securely and instantaneously oxidizes and decomposes the organic matter at the molecular level to form water vapor and small parts of carbon dioxide. The combination of photocatalysis with the plant is just perfect and guarantees a great improvement in performance.

Comparing NATEDE to other air filtering

 
Vitesy's technology has 3 worldwide patent pending applications.
 
Having a NATEDE means you can lay back and relax: the NATEDE app lets you take control of the air you breathe, hassle-free.
Whether you are cooking, working, relaxing or sleeping, you can select the right functioning mode of your NATEDE.

You will be able to save energy while you are not at home with its night mode, or boost its fan while you are preparing those yummy recipes with performance mode.
And if you need a good sleep to be ready for an intense day tomorrow, just make sure you breathe good air during the night.


The Internet of Things (IoT) is a scenario in which objects, devices, and sensors are given the ability to transfer data over a network without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction.
NATEDE can connect to other smart home devices, such as Amazon Alexa and Google Home, who will directly report the quality of the air you breathe and will be able to manage it with voice commands.



NATEDE features a proximity sensor that lets you turn it ON an OFF by simply moving your hand close to it. NATEDE is science, but you can do your little magic here.

NATEDE features an intuitive LED guide that lets you see the quality of your air without checking the app.


NATEDE features a self-watering system, which helps to further reduce water consumption– in addition to keeping plants alive while we are on the move or on long holidays - its water tank can bring water to plants for about a month.


NATEDE's new photocatalytic filter, combined with the increased efficiency of the air flow, will also reduce smoke, cooking, and bathroom odors.


 
NATEDE has a green soul: it is Made in Italy with sustainable materials often derived from natural waste. 
At Vitesy, we are committed to a green lifestyle, we respect our planet, and while NATEDE purifies your air from harmful elements that can affect your health we are keen on avoiding an impact on our planet.

FAQ
What is NATEDE?
NATEDE by Vitesy is a natural air purifier that combines the power of nature and technology to eliminate indoor pollution and to analyse it.
How does NATEDE work?
NATEDE is a filtration system based on the principle of phytoremediation, which is a process that allows plants to concentrate elements and compounds from the environment and to metabolize various molecules in their tissue. The filtering system is supercharged by the presence of a technological unit within NATEDE that exponentially increases the passage of air through the plant, eliminating harmful substances and purifying the air. Moreover, it has e new photocatalytic filter, which does not need to be replaced, therefore eliminating waste and extra costs.
What is a photocatalytic filter?
Light energy kick-starts a process that zaps all kinds of nasty air pollutants and turns them into harmless substances. For people who suffer from asthma and allergies, light-powered air purifiers like these are another weapon in the fight for cleaner air and better health. You don’t have to replace it, just rinse it with water!
What toxins and pollutants does NATEDE eliminate?
NATEDE eliminates 93% of VOCs (Volatile Organic Compounds) including benzene, ammonia, formaldehyde; 99% of bacteria, virus and fine particulate. NATEDE also removes odors.
What’s the main difference between NATEDE and a traditional flowerpot?
Regular flowerpots block the air flow at the root level, while NATEDE amplifies the phytoremediation process.

With soap, running water and glasses cloth, we can only clean the parts of glasses we can see.
