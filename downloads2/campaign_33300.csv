<p>California Cryptocoin has taken the necessary regulatory steps in becoming legitimate operators of Robocoin Kiosks here in the State of California. Our goal, with your help, is to bring liquidity and legitimacy to a rapidly expanding Bitcoin market. Currently, this is where we stand:
</p><p></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>We have purchased 2 Robocoin Kiosks -- They will be placed in Los Angeles and/or San Francisco. We will provide updates of where our machines will be specifically located once leasing has been confirmed.</li>
<li>We have applied for Money Transmission License -- This is a rigorous vetting process from the Department of Business Oversight which requires us to have a net worth of over $250k.</li>
<li>We have additional licensing in order to preempt any Bitcoin regulatory stance the US government may take.</li>
<li>We have scraped together $150k in startup from friends and family.</li>
</ul><p>What this means is that we are roughly $50k short of having a $250k net worth as a company. This is the minimum for us to obtain the correct licenses, so we need YOUR HELP!
</p><p></p><p></p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2>Where Does Your Donation Go?</h2>
<p>The $50,000 that we are looking to raise from you all will give us the necessary company net worth and will be allocated to two places specifically:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>$10,000 cash will go in each Robocoin kiosk. This is so that there is cash in the machines for you guys to withdraw!! -- This adds up to $20k</li>
<li>The remainder $30,000 will be deposited directly into our gateway exchange account (Bitstamp). This is so that when you place your order at CA Cryptocoin's Robocoin Kiosks, we can immediately place market orders on your Bitcoin. This allows for the seamless transactions of turning fiat currency into Bitcoin. (Please refer to ""Robocoin's Operation Scale"" infograph above for an easier understanding)</li>

<p>My name is <strong>Wanja Ngure</strong>. I am a <strong>Kenyan
human rights activist</strong> and VSO volunteer currently working with an NGO
in Malawi called Center for the Development of People (CEDEP). I have lived in
Malawi for over three years, and worked tirelessly as an advocate for the
rights of sex workers, vulnerable children, and LGBTQI individuals. My work at
CEDEP has comprised grant writing, overseeing monitoring and evaluation of
ongoing projects, advocacy, and implementing trainings and workshops. In this
capacity, I have grown especially passionate about working with sexual minority
populations who often face severe discrimination and violence in many African
countries. At CEDEP, <strong>I have been a key catalyst in expanding
programming for LGBTQI individuals living in Malawi</strong>. For example, I
founded a support group for lesbian and trans* identified individuals in
Lilongwe, providing them with a safe space for sharing challenges, learning
safe sexual practices, and coming to terms with their sexual identities. I am
proud to be part of the team that has pioneered the fight for the rights of sexual
minorities in Malawi.</p>
<p>I
have been accepted to a Master's programme in Human Rights at Kingston
University in London. I deferred my studies to, 2013, since I was not able to
provide the £12,000 pounds that were required by the institution. In 2013 i had
not raised enough fee hence could not make it to the graduate school. My
passion for activism and protection for Human Rights have given me the zeal to
continue and not to give up in search for this Masters. I wholeheartedly
believe that it is through learning about human rights that one is able to
respect, promote and defend them.<span>  In my
work I have realized that there are a great number of abuse cases which are
mostly caused by ignorance, greed and rigidity. We need people who are
passionate about human rights, who can defend everyone's human rights, and
facilitate in formulation and implementation. 
</span></p>
<p>It is now time for the next phase of my career as
a lifelong activist. <strong>In September 2014, I will commence a year-long
course of study at Kingston University outside London</strong>. This Masters of
Human Rights program will provide me with the technical and epistemological
tools needed to continue my advocacy and programming work. Specifically, I look
forward to being exposed to international perspectives on sexual minorities and
other pressing human rights issues I’ve become familiar with in Malawi and
forging networks with other organizations and individuals working in Africa
that will prove instrumental in the more global struggle to protect the rights
of sexual minorities. After completing my course of study at Kingston, <strong>I
plan to return to sub-Saharan Africa</strong> to continue my advocacy work
focusing on sexual minority populations living in homophobic contexts.</p>
<p>Although the cost of completing the Masters of
Human Rights degree is almost prohibitive for me, my passion drives me to
overcome this challenge. I have managed to save some funds from my small
stipend as a VSO volunteer in Malawi. I plan to work part time while completing
my degree at Kingston. Unfortunately, my family’s financial situation will not
permit them to provide me with support. I come from a small farming village in
central Kenya and I am one of six children. My dad passed away in 2012 and my
mother is a peasant farmer.  </p>
<p>Here, I am requesting your financial support to
help me cover accommodation costs while completing my degree at Kingston.
Though I plan to live as cheaply as possible, my part time work will not fully
cover my housing costs and partial tuition fee. In this regard, I would most
appreciate even the smallest increments of financial support. Your support will
enable me to devote my time to my academic work while in the UK, and ensure
that I return to Africa most equipped to lead the struggle for LGBTQI and other
minority populations.  </p>
<p>Thanks so much for your consideration. Please do
contact me if you have any questions about my plans, would like references from
my work or academic colleagues, or would like further information.</p>

<p>The purpose of this campaign is to make it possible for me to volunteer full-time for 6 months on three sister projects to WordPress: <i>BuddyPress, bbPress, and GlotPress</i>. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The focus will be solely on their continued maintenance, ongoing development, and evangelism.</span></p>
<p><a href=""https://wordpress.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">WordPress</a> is more community than software, yet the software that powers the community has nobody concentrating on it full time. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">I want to change this.</span></p><p>With your support, I would like to continue to dedicate my career to all three projects while remaining an independent and impartial entity with a dedicated period of distraction-free time.</p>
<h3>About BuddyPress</h3>
<p><a href=""https://buddypress.org"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">BuddyPress</a> provides social networking elements to a WordPress powered site, and is used to power WordPress.org community profiles. It's been downloaded over 2.3 million times.</p>
<p>When you post to make.wordpress.org, your posts and comments are funneled into your profile. When you participate in core development on Trac, that conversation and progress is tracked in your activity stream.</p>
<p>The badges you see on each <a href=""https://profiles.wordpress.org/johnjamesjacoby/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">member profile</a> is actually a BuddyPress Group, and the profiles themselves (over 16 million of them) are all powered by BuddyPress.</p>
<h3>About bbPress</h3>
<p>Every time you use the support forums across the WordPress.org network of sites, <a href=""https://bbpress.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">bbPress</a> is in the background making this possible. It's a modern twist on forum software and has been downloaded over 1.5 million times.</p>
<p>When you ask a plugin author a question, you're using bbPress to do it. When you browse the plugin and theme repositories, bbPress is the engine that powers those interfaces.</p><p>bbPress is also the de facto choice for WordPress powered support-forums for thousands of self hosted plugins and themes, because it integrates so nicely with WordPress itself.</p>
<h3>About GlotPress</h3>
<p><a href=""https://glotpress.org"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">GlotPress</a> is a collaborative, web-based software translation tool, and has enabled WordPress, BuddyPress, bbPress to be translated into 43 languages other than American English.</p>
<p>It's still a <a href=""https://backpress.org"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">BackPress</a> powered application that needs a fair amount of attention to port to using WordPress instead. With the plan being for all plugins and themes to use it soon, it's important GlotPress have someone to concentrate on improving it.</p><p>With WordPress 4.0, non-English downloads surpassed English ones for the first time ever, proving that GlotPress is a necessity for continuing to improve WordPress's global outreach. </p><p>If you use WordPress, BuddyPress, or bbPress in a language other than English, you have GlotPress to thank for this.</p>
<h3>Why This Matters</h3>
<p>WordPress is an enormously powerful and influential project, not just for the internet, but for the entire world to democratize the way we communicate. Sometimes this means Earth-shattering journalism and reporting, other times it means sharing pictures of cats. What matters most is we have the continued freedom to use the software(s) for anything we dream of.</p>
<p>BuddyPress and bbPress are official sister projects because they complement WordPress's goals so nicely. Where WordPress handles communication, BuddyPress and bbPress handle communities, enabling groups of individuals to congregate, collaborate, and share their thoughts with one another under the same democratic ethos as WordPress.</p>
<p>GlotPress unilaterally enables WordPress, BuddyPress, and bbPress to grow into the rest of the non-English speaking world.</p>
<h3>Achievements</h3>
<p>WordPress currently powers about 23% of the top sites on the web, achieved via thousands of contributions spanning several organizations. Though the number fluctuates, there are sometimes 10 or more full-time developers staffed to work on WordPress (many of which whom I consider to be close friends and colleagues.)</p>
<p>BuddyPress, bbPress, and GlotPress, have not had anyone concentrating on their development full-time since 2008. Any progress has only been by virtue of volunteering time between obligations to clients and other full-time work. Despite this lack of focus, BuddyPress and bbPress are hugely active and wildly successful projects, and GlotPress is bursting at the seams with potential.</p><p></p><h3>About Me</h3><p>My name is John James Jacoby, and I've been the project lead for (and a lead developer of) both BuddyPress and bbPress since 2010. I worked at Automattic for 3 years on a wide variety of projects ranging from WordCamp.org to WordPress.com VIP, and also recently worked at 10up for just-shy-of 1 year where I directed their engineering team.</p>
<h3>What I Need</h3>
<p>I'm hoping to raise $50,000 USD to support myself, my family, and cover related expenses for a minimum of 6 months while I focus on improving BuddyPress, bbPress, and GlotPress.</p><p>All monies will go towards costs of living, fees from the campaign itself (9% to Indiegogo), and any travel costs for speaking or educational engagements directly related to these projects.</p>
<p>If the full goal is not met, don't worry... I will prorate the duration accordingly so I can focus full-time efforts for the longest period of time. Your contributions will still make a huge difference.</p>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>By helping me achieve this goal of volunteering on BuddyPress, bbPress, &amp; GlotPress full-time, you will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allow me to help build the WordPress.org community hub we have been talking about for years.</li>
<li>Enable me to stay an independent and impartial party, financially backed by the community I aim to please and serve.</li>
<li>Allow me to provide guidance and leadership to three amazing projects that hugely benefit from it.<br/>
</li>
</ul><p>More specifically, I hope to focus on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Query and caching performance improvements to both BuddyPress and bbPress (to help them power the almost 20 million user profiles and the immense amount of activity going into them from all of the support forums)</li>
<li>Media &amp; Attachment support in BuddyPress</li>
<li>Per-forum moderation in bbPress to help with plugin &amp; theme moderation on WordPress.org.</li>
</ul><p>In an effort to remain as transparent as possible, I will document my experiences of what being sponsored by the WordPress community and volunteering on open source software full time is like. I will also blog weekly with updates on the results this campaign has empowered me to complete.</p>
<h3>When Will This Happen?</h3>
<p>This campaign will be running until December 11, 2014. When the campaign ends, I will break the total up into months and blog about the details. I expect to start immediately after, for the maximum amount of time allowed by your donations.</p>
<h3>Why Me?</h3>
<p>I discovered BuddyPress, bbPress, BackPress, and WordPress(μ) at about the same time in 2007. I wasn't very impressed by where they were but saw huge potential for what I could help them become. I started patching bbPress, BackPress, BuddyPress, and WordPress, which eventually led me into full-time freelancing and consulting in 2009 &amp; 2010.</p>
<p>In November of 2010 I started at Automattic, originally focused on WordPress.org, switching to working on Jetpack, ending with code review, security &amp; performance audits, and deployments on WordPress.com VIP.</p>
<p>I learned a lot, and made great friendships and relationships, but ended up far away from the software I am most passionate about.</p><p>I left Automattic to work at 10up, and after 9 months directing their engineering team, I made more friends and had a great career but was even farther than I'd ever been from the software that brings me the most joy. This campaign can change that.</p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>This campaign only exists to eliminate the biggest risks and challenges that prohibit me from succeeding; distraction. I have spent the greater portion of the past 5 years distracted from the most important things in my life: family, balance, and the WordPress community.</p>
<p>The things I am afraid of aren't unique to this campaign or it's goals. I'm afraid of a lot of different things, mostly that no one understands how important these projects really are (to WordPress.org, and the rest of the world) but with your help, we can make an enormous difference together.</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you're not able to help financially, there's a ton you can do to help everyone else. Pass this campaign along to others, help out in the <a href=""http://wordpress.org/support/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">support forums</a>, help build <a href=""https://core.trac.wordpress.org"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">WordPress</a>, <a href=""https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">BuddyPress</a>, <a href=""https://bbpress.trac.wordpress.org"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">bbPress</a>, and <a href=""https://glotpress.trac.wordpress.org"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">GlotPress</a>, or just mention me on Twitter and say hi.</p>
<h3>In Closing</h3>
<p>WordPress has introduced me to so many amazing people and enabled so many great things in my life, I want to continue giving back for as long as possible. With your help, I can remain independent and impartial to commercial self-interests and bias influences while leading the initiatives for free &amp; open online communication with BuddyPress, bbPress, &amp; GlotPress.</p>
<p>I was originally reluctant to the idea of raising money like this, and reticent about why money is ultimately necessary for me to continue to make this happen. Having put this together with the editorial help of a few friendly WordPress community members, I'm convinced it's the right approach, and am super excited to get started.</p>
<p>Thank you immensely for your support, and I look forward to what we will accomplish together.</p></div>","The Goal

My roots are in the Northside. My dad was also born and raised on the Northside.  My grandparents, great-grand parents, aunts and uncles lived on Armandale Street since the 1920’s.  I owned a video store in Perry Hilltop in the 90's and I currently unify Northside natives through my events like Grazin In The Grass (NVH), Northside Skating Parties also the Perry, Oliver &amp; Allegheny High School Reunions.<br/><br/><p>It is a
community in need of uplifting. It's populated and prosperous past, has slowly
dissipated over the years in the name of progress.  The need to attract
new business, residents and visitors to the historically rich area is vital to
its survival. Our goal is to preserve &amp; promote its multicultural past and
instill a new sense of pride. </p>
<p>Thanks to the power of the internet we've been able to
gather a collection of Allegheny City &amp; Northside photos and relics.They cover a span of over 150 years. 
Currently the images and objects are very popular on the internet and have even
sparked many reunions. As a result we have decided create a physical location
to put them on display. The Allegheny City Historic Gallery
will be the ultimate Northside visual experience.  It’s actually more than just a gallery, it’s
more of a museum or learning center. It
is free to the public, and a place for Northsiders to reconnect with friends
and family. </p>
<p>The Allegheny City Historic Gallery is a non-profit venture
partnered by myself, Kim Gandy and City Council Woman Darlene Harris.  It will be located on Historic East Ohio
Street. The collection is a collaboration
of public &amp; private images and also objects.  It has become a community project because many of the images and objects
on display were donated by past &amp; present Northsiders, as well as the
Allegheny City Society. So far we’ve
raised $12,000:  7,000 from the URA, 5,000 from the City. This
will help keep us open for 6 months, but it’s not enough to pay for all the
gallery functions and administrative costs. Plus we believe the Gallery should be a permanent fixture in Northside’s
landscape, because history and change happens daily.  We need your help to make this a
reality. </p>

<p><b>The
concept </b>behind FIRST and the FIRST Tech Challenge program is to build a new
robotic creation each year designed to meet a new game challenge.  While building the robot, the team members
learn basic engineering and problem solving skills, team dynamics, business
concepts, and how to overcome obstacles. 
Completed robots are driven by the FIRST teams in a series of competitive
events leading up to a final World Competition held in St. Louis, MO.  This program is an awesome way for America’s
students to become motivated in STEM fields!</p>
<p>A key component of the FIRST program is community outreach, advancing
interest in the STEM fields for both boys and girls.  In the true spirit of FIRST,  Fusion team members give back to the community by
actively supporting and mentoring the junior
scientists and engineers of the future!</p>

program that teaches students how to excel in a team oriented environment
with gracious professionalism while learning life skill concepts in science,
engineering, team dynamics, and business. 
</p>
<p><b>How we will use the funds raised:</b>  Our expenses are estimated as follows:</p>
<p><b>Western
Super Regional:</b>  Mar 19-23; Hotel,
Meals, and Travel Expenses</p>
<p>Hotel: 4 nights - $1,600<br/></p><p>Meals: $500

</p><p>Van Rental and Fuel Costs:  $700 </p>
<p><b>Total:
$2,790</b></p>
<p><b>Worlds:</b> Apr 23-26;  Air Fare, Hotel, Meals,

<p>Meals: $500</p>
<p>Car Rental: $400</p>
<p><b>Total:
$5,228</b></p>
<p><i>Any funds not used for travel  will be used for the ongoing robotics program
expenses and for community outreach programs such as helping to start and
sponsor new teams.  Robotics clubs are
very cost intensive (but worth every penny in what our students learn and
achieve!!!) with start up costs as follows:  </i></p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Start up: New kit of parts, electronics, computer
brain, laptop: $3,500</p>

events leading up to a final World Competition held in St. Louis, MO.  This program is an awesome way for America’s
students to become motivated in STEM fields!
A key component of the FIRST program is community outreach, advancing
interest in the STEM fields for both boys and girls.  In the true spirit of FIRST,  Fusion team members give back to the community by
actively supporting and mentoring the junior
scientists and engineers of the future!


Team
Fusion is sponsored by Dehesa Charter School a 501(c)3 non-profit  educational institution headquartered in San
Diego, CA.  The robotics program is registered with the FIRST robotics world-wide
program that teaches students how to excel in a team oriented environment
with gracious professionalism while learning life skill concepts in science,
engineering, team dynamics, and business. 

How we will use the funds raised:  Our expenses are estimated as follows:
Western
Super Regional:  Mar 19-23; Hotel,
Meals, and Travel Expenses
Hotel: 4 nights - $1,600Meals: $500

Van Rental and Fuel Costs:  $700 
Total:
$2,790
Worlds: Apr 23-26;  Air Fare, Hotel, Meals,
Car Airfare: 2 Teachers, 6 Team Members: $2,728
Hotel: 4 nights - $1,600
Meals: $500
Car Rental: $400
Total:
$5,228
Any funds not used for travel  will be used for the ongoing robotics program
expenses and for community outreach programs such as helping to start and
sponsor new teams.  Robotics clubs are
very cost intensive (but worth every penny in what our students learn and
achieve!!!) with start up costs as follows:  
· 
Start up: New kit of parts, electronics, computer
brain, laptop: $3,500
· 
Build of New Robot: $1,200 to $2,300 ( yearly parts
cost after initial start up costs)
· 
Registration/Competitive Entry Fees Per Year: $1,300

</h3>
<p>The SHRED Foundation is harnessing the unifying power of snow/skate culture to inspire an alternative path for young people considering non-traditional career opportunities. By partnering with local stakeholders  (organizations, schools, local 
recreation departments, snow/skate companies, reps, shops, mountains, and brands), SHRED will provide apprentice programs for youth who are interested in pursuing 
potential careers outside of traditional routes. SHRED values the importance of teaching its youth the core aspects of the 
culture, which include individuality, creativity, progression, 
entrepreneurial drive and community. </p>
<p>The foundation was created by Danny Hairston, former Senior Program Manager for Stoked Mentoring and former Fundraising and Event Coordinator for Burton Snowboards' Chill Foundation.

My 12 year-old daughter Riley has been through swimming lessons at the Odawa Native Friendship Centre Program since she was a baby. Two years ago when she expressed an interest in competative swimming the first year was financially manageable and we did our best for her second year after seeing how much she liked it and seeing how good she was it.

I'd rather ask for financial assistance this way to do what I can to make it work than give her this news. </span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Last year she was a really dedicated swimmer and her hard work and passion for swimming has really given her focus in school and the confidence to join other sports like running, triathalons and pretty much every other sport that her school has to offer! </span></p>
<p>All together the fees are going to cost $3600. We need $511 by tomorrow plus a new bathing suit which is about $80 or so. The first goal for this campaign is $600 (first set of swim fees, bathing suit and Indiegogo platform fees). </p>
<p>I'm going to take her to her first swim practice tomorrow regardless is we have payment or not and ask for a payment extension until the end of this week so I have time to raise the money. </p>

project::
„Eine Kleine Geschichte über die Liebe“
""a small
Story about Love""
A Small Story About Love“ will be  a book for
children aged 8+ and 
the project is about financing a bilingual version in german and english. 
Author:
          Peter
Bosch 
Artwork:
       Alexandra Bolzer
Typography:
Nele Focke
 
The STORY:
Each year, there ist the „Festival oft the
Donkey-Ear“ on the island of Le Sél: with grey , stubborn animals, prickly
balloons, professors of emotion and lots and of books and tales. The book is
about reading, donkeys, dog-ears, donkey-ears and of course very much about
love. Sandro does not really like Sanja. She is much to clever and most of all,
she is a girl. But the prickly balloon likes Sanja all the more. Unfortunately,
he cannot talk and tell her…
This book combines three artistic fields: 
1.       
The text (Peter Bosch) combines
realistic with imaginative elements, everything is familiar and yet a bit
different, out of place.
2.       
The illustrations (Alexandra
Bolzer) evolve from the story, complement the story elaborately and take you by
surprise with a diversity of different styles and materials.
3.       
The typography (Nele Focke) has
its autonomous role, makes references to the illustrations and the text as well
and so creates an additional visual and aesthetic layer.
 
Why should you support this
project?
Everybody who can still
remember how inspiring childrens' books can be and how much pedagogical value
good children's literature has, should support this project.
  
What happens with the funds after successful
financing?
We need about 4500 Euro to fund a bilingual version: If we recieve this amount of money we will translate
the original german book in a bilingual version (german / english), fund the printing costs and the new layout.If we do not get the hole costs supported, we will use the money for advertising the german version e.g on the Frankfurter Buchmesse in October 14.

if you have any questions, do

If the families provided shelter and food, the families often could not pay for education or even clothing. For the children orphaned in her village, Alice sent her own money to help families care for the orphans. She also found other sponsors to provide for children via MoneyGram. In 2007, Alice coordinated the shipment of a cargo container of clothing, books, toys, and school equipment to the village. ( Since then, she has tried to send a container every year. )In 2008, she bought the property in the Kogelo countryside for the site of an orphanage.Local people built the pre-school.  Alice hired and pays a teacher.The photo montage at the start of the video shows the early years, as the orphanage progressed from a school and church under a mango tree, to a preschool built of traditional sticks and mud. Alice paid for the sheet-metal roofs of the mud-walled preschool and improvised kitchen.She did this with her earnings and the volunteer work of the Kogelo community. Her money and containers of donated clothing, books, and toys  provided for approximately seventy children.  Friends in Los Angeles saw she could not pay for the completion of an orphanage.  To raise funds to build a dormitory, kitchen, and classrooms, her friends guided her through the process of forming a 501 (c)(3), Goshen K. International Outreach, Inc.In this Indiegogo.com campaign, she hopes to accelerate the completion of the orphanage.  In August, she will travel to Kenya again, at her own expense, to deliver another container of clothing, toys, and school supplies for the children.$10,000 will provide for the building of a dormitory with solar night lights, a real kitchen, classrooms and a fence around the orphanage.  She will stay on site to supervise. The Christmas Day, 2013 section of the video shows the community welcoming Alice and her foreign friends.  A foreign volunteer videos and photographs the event.A teacher from California interviews the pastor and Alice on the needs of the orphanage.Photos and background information can be seen at -- http://www.goshenk.org/index.htmMore videos can be seen at YouTube / Goshen Orphans --http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnGVs0l9XWU-5E2oQ03fingIn August, Alice hopes a volunteer will video the building of the facilities.  Contributors will be listed in the credits of the video. All of the contributions will go to the orphanage.  Alice will not spend contributions on offices, hotels, or executives.  This is a project in progress for seven years.  Alice has financed what she could.  If Alice receives the full $10,000, she will devote all the funds to the buildings and fence.  If she receives less, she builds what she can.   If she receives more, she will build more and hire more teachers.Please contribute.  Please forward this indiegogo.com project to everyone you know.  Please forward the videos or place the videos on your Facebook page.  In an era of impersonal and difficult-to-track multi-billion dollar foreign aid programs, this project will show where the donations go -- and the children who will sleep in their own beds and learn in their own classrooms.Donations will give seventy orphans a future. They will thank you all their lives.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

</div></div>","On 25th April 2015, Nepal was struck by a devastating 7.8 magnitude earthquake that killed more than 8,600 people and destroyed 473,000 homes. The often neglected part of the tale is that over 14,000 children no longer have a school to go to...
Childreach International are working with the local government to build 100 new classrooms in the Sindhupalchowk district. The first few classrooms are beginning to go up as we speak, but there is still a long way to go...
 I am fundraising to join Childreach on one of their 'Big Builds' where volunteers help to make the new classrooms a stimulating and engaging learning environment. Having taken part in a Big Build Nepal in 2014, where I assisted with the construction of a brand new early childhood development centre, I am desperate to do all I can to ensure that children can access education in the aftermath of the earthquakes. (nb. the early development centre not only survived the earthquakes with zero damage, but it acted as a shelter to the community of Sankhu in the immediate aftermath of the disaster).RAISED SO FAR ACROSS 2 PLATFORMS - £590  

I am grateful for whatever you can give. As a thank you, I'd like to offer the following perks. 
£5 - A personal thank you on my 'lisaboylesmedia' social media platforms to share with your family and friends
£15 - A thank you letter personally written to you from the team at Childreach International
£50 - One of a kind handmade bracelet from Kathmandu
£100 - Sacred Nepali prayer flags from Kathmandu
All funds will be added to my cumulative fundraising target of £2,300 on BT My Donate. From this page 100% of the money goes to Childreach International.




Childreach know that every child has the right to live, learn and play. To be safe, healthy and free. In the aftermath of the earthquake, children's lives have turned upside down. Access to suitable classrooms, that will shelter them from the cold winter temperatures is a necessity in helping them to fulfil their potential.
Also, research indicates that children are at significantly less risk of falling into the preying hands of child traffickers if they are in school. Childreach, together with SOLD the Movie, are working to ensure that children are taught, not trafficked. New classrooms is but the tip of iceberg for their prevention work - but it needs to be the starting point as schools are the centre of a community.

    

The aftermath of monsoon season and the severe fuel crisis is slowing the progress on the new classrooms. Despite delays, Childreach are continuing to construct the new classrooms with the help of local experts and volunteers.

<p><b>SHORT SUMMARY</b></p>
<p>A youth led, child centered and for
children grassroots initiative whose mission is to rescue children from
violence, hazardous work and to promote good health and education to vulnerable
children. Values are at the core of everything we do. Our registration number
is 104414 in the Republic of Zambia.</p>
<p>1 in 5 children aged 2 to 5years in my
community village is out of school and spending over 14hours on the
streets  with a sibling or mother or grandmother. In 2014 alone, over 60
children in my village missed out on early learning due to lack of financial
support for them to enroll in early education centres. Nearly 60% of the
households are living below $1.25 per day and go with 1 meal a day, sometimes
none. This has resulted in children being found where adults are doing their
usual business and this has led to many abuses including physical and sexual
abuse of the children. Taverns, bars, highways, sand mines and markets are not
safe places for children. </p>
<p>Youth First Development is running a
community early education centre to protect children from these vices whilst
intervening on their education and health needs.</p>
<p>Currently, our centre has 60 children
that were previously in the markets, bars and taverns with parents on the
streets, abused and neglected children including disabled children. All these
have been left out in the education system and have not benefited from
government social assistance programs. This project will reduce the number of
children missing out on education from 1 in 10 to only 1 in 3 children. We need
U$8,000 to achieve this.</p>
<p><b>WHAT WE NEED &amp;
WHAT YOU GET</b></p>
<p>The project needs U$8, 000 to improve
its centre building, 60 chairs and tables, play materials (10 sets consisting
dolls and other child friendly toys), learning materials and teaching aids
(flip charts, picture charts, crayons, chalkboard). </p>
<p>To show our great appreciation, we give
locally made crafts and artifacts to our supporters in addition to giving you
an opportunity to come out and be part of our field programs in the community

<p>This project will reduce from 1 in 10
children without access to early learning opportunity to 1 in 3 and double the
number of children that are accessing education in safe environments. The
opportunity also reduces by more than half the children at risk of abuse and

supported 2 children living with disability to access wheelchairs, enroll in
school and increase their families’ access to food and safe waters and
sanitation. We have also rescued from early marriages and supported them to
return to school while supporting them create their own wealth through
financial inclusion programs. More than 233 young people have been sensitized
on the sexual and reproductive health rights through trainings, campaigns and
life skills.</p>

<br/></div>","SHORT SUMMARY
A youth led, child centered and for
children grassroots initiative whose mission is to rescue children from
violence, hazardous work and to promote good health and education to vulnerable
children. Values are at the core of everything we do. Our registration number
is 104414 in the Republic of Zambia.
1 in 5 children aged 2 to 5years in my
community village is out of school and spending over 14hours on the
streets  with a sibling or mother or grandmother. In 2014 alone, over 60
children in my village missed out on early learning due to lack of financial
support for them to enroll in early education centres. Nearly 60% of the
households are living below $1.25 per day and go with 1 meal a day, sometimes
none. This has resulted in children being found where adults are doing their
usual business and this has led to many abuses including physical and sexual
abuse of the children. Taverns, bars, highways, sand mines and markets are not
safe places for children. 
Youth First Development is running a
community early education centre to protect children from these vices whilst
intervening on their education and health needs.
Currently, our centre has 60 children
that were previously in the markets, bars and taverns with parents on the
streets, abused and neglected children including disabled children. All these
have been left out in the education system and have not benefited from
government social assistance programs. This project will reduce the number of
children missing out on education from 1 in 10 to only 1 in 3 children. We need
U$8,000 to achieve this.
WHAT WE NEED &
WHAT YOU GET
The project needs U$8, 000 to improve
its centre building, 60 chairs and tables, play materials (10 sets consisting
dolls and other child friendly toys), learning materials and teaching aids
(flip charts, picture charts, crayons, chalkboard). 
To show our great appreciation, we give
locally made crafts and artifacts to our supporters in addition to giving you
an opportunity to come out and be part of our field programs in the community
such as reading for the children, playing field games with them including
painting alongside the children etc. As a way of thanking you, YFD will
intentionally recognize your contributions on our website and in annual reports.
ALL the funds will go towards ""My
World My Child"" protection program in Mulimba Village in Chibombo, 90km
from Lusaka the capital city of Zambia.
THE IMPACT
This project will reduce from 1 in 10
children without access to early learning opportunity to 1 in 3 and double the
number of children that are accessing education in safe environments. The
opportunity also reduces by more than half the children at risk of abuse and
exploitation in the community. This is your to contribute to cause that will
change the world, and support better lifestyles for children in need, giving
them a chance to financially independent in their future.

<p>New Orleans is the place where America's music took root, and we as modern-day Americans need to keep it growing. At a time when gun violence is an increasingly common intrusion into the lives of our youth, our goal is to try to place an instrument in the hands of a child who might otherwise find the way of the streets more alluring. So you, as a contributor, will not only help to save part of New Orleans culture but also attempt to preserve a child's future.</p>

<p>James Demaria is a professional photographer and documentary filmmaker from NYC who has called New Orleans home twice in his life. After moving his family back to New York, post Hurricane Katrina, his mission has been to shine a light on the culture and music of the Crescent City through his accomplished photography and video projects. His most recent documentary is entitled <i>The Key To Me: The Paul And Shelly Sanchez Story</i> and will air on PBS this coming March. </p>
<p>James has teamed up with Trumpets Not Guns to start his latest documentary endeavor, <i>TRAD</i>. This film analyzes the ongoing efforts to keep the roots music flourishing in the TRAD-itional manner. In a city flooded by musicians from the outside world, James endeavors to highlight the true, native players of New Orleans music. The film centers on Jazz saxophone player Calvin Johnson Jr., who comes from a long line of NOLA musicians. In <i>TRAD</i>, Calvin discuss the traditions which not only shape the music but also shape the lives of the people who live in the thriving musical communities. Interviews thus far include such notable performers as Irvin Mayfield, Kidd Jordan, Roger Lewis, Carl Leblanc, Debbie Davis and Paul Sanchez. There is also a performance filmed at historic Preservation Hall where Calvin was the youngest person to lead a band in the hallowed space.</p>
<p><b>Now it's up to you.</b></p>
<p>We have the vision, but we need the tools. By helping to finance <i>TRAD,</i> you will be helping to preserve an art form that is truly American in nature. Only in New Orleans has the blending of African, European and Native American traditions created such a unique and irreplaceable form of Jazz. Without care and cultivation, that art form will be forever lost. TNG recognizes that students need instruments and young artists need to be supported. Our first TNG Production aims to bring awareness and inspiration but to that end, we need the financial support of the community. The funds that are raised will help cover the costs of everything from plane tickets to sound engineers. It will cover editors and production assistants. It will allow James Demaria to take this film to completion so that the vibrant traditional music of New Orleans can galvanize a new generation. </p><p></p></div>","The mission of Trumpets Not Guns is to provide inner city schools in New Orleans with musical instruments, band uniforms, books and whatever else is needed to keep the music playing.

<p>The goal of Youth Leading the World (YLTW) is to build a movement of inspired leaders with the skills to create an environmentally sustainable, spiritually fulfilling and socially just human presence on the planet and become leaders of positive change. This project aims to do this through the following four ways:</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">1.  Inform youth about local and global environmental challenges</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">2.  Allow youth to reflect and go through a visioning process of how they want their community and the world to be sustainable and just</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">3.  Give space for change to happen through creative thinking and brainstorming</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">4. Provide support for action planning and practical goal setting for both personal and community change.</p>
<p>YLTW is a three-day intensive process in which young people explore local and global issues of sustainability, measure and understand their own ecological footprint and work on action plans to make change in their lives, schools and communities. <a href=""http://www.ozgreen.org/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=itemlist&amp;layout=category&amp;task=category&amp;id=101&amp;Itemid=260)"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">OzGreen</a>, an Australian non-profit, designed this process and have had great success in using this process as a way to integrate transformative learning and leadership process that fast tracks our transition to sustainability. The curriculum expressly integrates transformative learning and leading processes in order to prepare and support youth in making deeply rooted commitments to action now.</p>
<p>Youth participants will be informed about local and global environmental challenges like climate change and led through a visioning process for how they want their community and the world to be. With that vision in mind, they brainstorm and have time for creative thinking to identify opportunities for change. The experience will end with action planning and goal setting for personal and community change. They will present their action plans to their other classmates and teachers.</p>
<p><strong>Every year, YLTW conducts an annual congress in which young people from more than 90 global locations are digitally linked together throughout the three days.  We want to plug Costa Rican youth into this process! </strong></p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Bringing YLTW to Costa Rica</span></strong></p>
<p>On September 3-5 we will hold YLTW in Costa Rica for the first time. It will be held in the small rural town of Mastatal, on a local organic farm called Finca Siempre Verde. Finca Siempre Verde was founded by Marcos Garcia Guzman and is a rural ecotourism destination and an organic farm developing permaculture. It is one of four farms in Mastatal that is dedicated to sustainability and a resilient community.</p>
<p>Participants will attend from three different local high schools: CTP La Gloria, the high school in Mastatal, and the high school in Zapaton.</p>
<p>To prepare for this global event, we have hired a trained instructor for  YLTW, to train Marcos and three other local people to serve as facilitators. </p>
<p>Facilitators will learn how to lead YLTW, but also gain skills in leadership, project development, and communication which will allow them to continue this work and support the youth in the work they choose to do after being a part of this program.</p>
<p><strong>Who are we?</strong></p>
<p>My name is Emily McVey and I grew up and go to college in Southern California. I am a student studying Earth System Science, Global Sustainability, and Community Engagement. While in school, I also worked on campus developing our Global Sustainability Resource Center, which is a student-led initiative to foster a campus culture of sustainability. Last Spring, I was the Student Coordinator of the UCI Costa Rica Program and traveled to Costa Rica in March of 2013, which is how I was connected with this community. Mastatal is a small town with about 150 locals. It has four organic farms that host volunteers and interns and educate about sustainability and resiliency. I am living at Finca Siempre Verde as a farm intern from June 13-September 12 and I am working with Marcos Garcia Guzman, the founder of Finca Siempre Verde.</p>
<p>Marcos Garcia is playing a large role in this project. He grew up in Mastatal and has a very good connection with the community. He lives on his parent’s land and runs Finca Siempre Verde, an organic farm. He has been a part of the local government in the past and is involved in many different projects in the community, including the recent conceptualization of an organization that will be called Mastatal Verde Regeneracion. The following is a comment from him about why having YLTW here is important to him:</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Living in a remote area and not having much contact with the outside can be a big limitation for a small town and especially for the young population. My main reason for wanting to have Youth Leading the World here in my community is for youth to gain knowledge and the desire to be future leaders in their communities, as this is necessary for this type of population. Having the ability to have a program like this will be opening a big door for these young people to learn new concepts and become leaders in sustainability. It will be a unique experience and they can then carry this knowledge to the rest of the community and make a change in a larger way with many people. Besides this, the place we would like to hold this program, Finca Siempre Verde, is an organic farm with many important sustainable-based techniques. Giving them the chance to stay here will enrich these students, giving more experience and knowledge for the participants.</p>
<p><strong>What do we need?</strong></p>
<p>We need a total of $1,600.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">$960 Food and Lodging for the 12 students in the ecotourism class at CTP La Gloria. These students don't have the resources to come and stay at Finca Siempre Verde for YLTW and Marcos doesn't have the resources to sponsor them. It is $80 per student for the 3 days.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">$400  Food and Lodging for 5 students from Zapaton. These students don't have the resources to come and stay at Finca Siempre Verde for YLTW and Marcos doesn't have the resources to sponsor them. It is $80 per student for the 3 days.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">$80 Lunches for the 4 students from Mastatal attending the three days. They go home each night. It will cost $20 per student.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">$160 Trainer food and lodging for when he comes and stays at Finca Siempre Verde to train faciilitators.</p>
<p>We were fortunate enough to recieve a $1,000 grant and so now we only need to raise at least $600!</p>
<p>If we are not fully funded, but are close to goal amount, we will go through with the project. If we are far off from our goal amount, we will still hold YLTW, but it will be at one of the schools, so we will use the funds to  provude transportation and food for the students.</p>
<p><strong>What will the impact be?</strong></p>
<p>I am creating this campaign page from Mastatal, Costa Rica.  It is a very special community. It resides against a national park called La Cangreja. It is a beautiful community, but there are not many opportunities for jobs. Not only is this a problem for adults currently living here, but also for the youth that will be out of school very soon. Many of them are likely to leave for nearby cities like Puriscal and San Jose to find jobs. The students from La Gloria and Zapaton come from other neighboring communities facing the same concerns as Mastatal. I care about sharing the YLTW process with young people here because I believe they will be key in the regeneration of their communities, and they could continue this work as facilitators in the future and leaders in their communities. This would allow them to facilitate the process for youth in other communities throughout Costa Rica and empower people in both rural and urban settings.</p>
<p>I am starting this project because it is too late to not be engaging our hearts in the crises we are facing. I care deeply about the planet and all life forms on it and want to create a world where the environment doesn’t need protecting. I feel that facilitating the situation for youth to feel the urgency and magnitude of both the loss and opportunity we have in this moment can be transformational and empowering.  We need processes that allow us to acknowledge, experience, and move through grief as communities in order to clear the way for informed and inspired action to build a sustainable, resilient, and just community both locally and globally. I am looking empower both the facilitators and the participants to continue this work and continue holding YLTW congresses throughout Costa Rica.</p>
<p> The students we will be working with live in different communities around Mastatal and are all facing similar struggles. The communities lack jobs and many young people are leaving towns to find jobs in larger cities like Puriscal and San Jose. In Mastatal, there is an ongoing effort from local leaders to form a non-profit organization to regenerate the community. This program will be a way to involve the youth from these communities in the effort to regenerate and create sustainable, resilient communities. It is important to give them the opportunity to create a vision of how they want their community to be and identify actions that could be taken to achieve those visions.</p>
<p>The purpose of this project is to give these students an experience that will launch them into taking action in their communities. In Mastatal, some leaders have already started taking action to help with the issues they are facing by working on creating an organization, but the youth haven’t been involved. Marcos Garcia wrote a comment about the organization that has been in the process of forming over the last few months:</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">I live in Mastatal, a small town of a population of 150 people a bit isolated but with very good people. For the past month some of the community leaders have seen the need to have a group representing identity of our community. In a few days we are having our local group legalized and we will be ready to work and find the right contacts for a long list of needs for our community. This group will be called Mastatal Verde Regeneracion and the mission will be to provide social and environmental assistance in our community. Mastatal Verde Regeneracion will seek funds nationally and internationally.</p>
<p>Since some students will not be from Mastatal, but other local towns, they will be able to see what Mastatal is doing to regenerate their community. It will give them the opportunity to see what they could do and what they can bring back to their community in both skills and ideas.</p>
<p>When YLTW is held again next year, the students involved in this year’s program will be able to train as facilitators and host the next YLTW on their own. They can also hold more YLTW in other areas of Costa Rica and expand their impact. We hope that we will be able to inspire these students to start groups in their schools, or even their communities so that they will become leaders and start make change and inspiring others. Hosting these students at Finca Siempre Verde and exposing them to the concept of visioning and practical goal setting for change through actions will be seeding future leaders of these communities. This will support ongoing efforts to regenerate these communities and start the fire for global change to create a socially and environmentally just world.</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>Please share this page with family and friends and let them know how important it is so we can reach our goal. Thanks for your help!!!</p>

In a few days we are having our local group legalized and we will be ready to work and find the right contacts for a long list of needs for our community. This group will be called Mastatal Verde Regeneracion and the mission will be to provide social and environmental assistance in our community. Mastatal Verde Regeneracion will seek funds nationally and internationally.
Since some students will not be from Mastatal, but other local towns, they will be able to see what Mastatal is doing to regenerate their community. It will give them the opportunity to see what they could do and what they can bring back to their community in both skills and ideas.
When YLTW is held again next year, the students involved in this year’s program will be able to train as facilitators and host the next YLTW on their own. They can also hold more YLTW in other areas of Costa Rica and expand their impact. We hope that we will be able to inspire these students to start groups in their schools, or even their communities so that they will become leaders and start make change and inspiring others. Hosting these students at Finca Siempre Verde and exposing them to the concept of visioning and practical goal setting for change through actions will be seeding future leaders of these communities. This will support ongoing efforts to regenerate these communities and start the fire for global change to create a socially and environmentally just world.

foster a positive attitude toward the STEM fields through a six-week summer

<p>Good day to you, Internet!</p>
<p>As the video says, my name is Robert Kroll. I am a part-time English professor at St. Clair County Community College, Jackson College, and Macomb Community College (yes, I teach at all three presently).</p>
<p>Recently, I decided that I should try to see if I have anything I could present at academic conferences. I submitted to a couple that caught my interest and a rather high profile one that I didn't think I'd have a chance for. Who knew that the three would accept me? </p>
<p>The conferences are:</p>
<p>Stage the Future II @ Arizona State University (March 7 to 8)- For this, I will be presenting a paper on the Doctor Who Proms of 2008, 2010, and 2013.</p>
<p>Orson Welles: A Centennial Celebration and Symposium @ Indiana University (April 30 to May 3) - Here I will be presenting a paper about the commercial and voiceover work Orson Welles did later in his life.</p>
<p>Great Writing 2015 @ Imperial College London (June 20 to 21) - I will be presenting a paper about the creative writing techniques of prisoners.</p>
<p>I am excited for all of these, but the most important one is easily the Great Writing 2015 conference, as that is at one of the world's most prestigious colleges and it will be for an international audience. There is also the possibility that the essays I present will be published in the future.</p>
<p>Sadly though, even with all of the work I have as an instructor, I do not have money to make it to all of these. I am saving as much as I can for these. I have money set aside already, but it is not nearly what I would like it to be. Additionally, I am applying for funds to go to these events, but institutional funding is never a sure thing.</p>
<p>The money you contribute will be going toward transportation (cars, public transit, airplane tickets and fees), lodging at each of the conferences (I'm not going for 5 star hotels. Days Inn and Airbnb are just fine by me), conference registrations, food at each location, and any other costs that arise from staying at any of these places. </p>
<p>I will assure you that while I will be taking in sights at all of these places, I am *not* doing this because I want you to fund my vacations. These are big opportunities for me and I am focused on giving the best presentations that I can. </p>
<p>In the interest of full disclosure, should I not be able to raise funds for everything, I will most likely cancel the ASU visit and all funds will go toward attending the Indiana University and Imperial College conferences.</p>
<p>By donating you will be helping me get to some major conferences, each of which have very important people who will be in attendance. Ultimately, I am hoping attendance to these will mean that I will enhance my portfolio and get a job as a full-time English professor somewhere.</p>

</div></div>","Good day to you, Internet!
As the video says, my name is Robert Kroll. I am a part-time English professor at St. Clair County Community College, Jackson College, and Macomb Community College (yes, I teach at all three presently).
Recently, I decided that I should try to see if I have anything I could present at academic conferences. I submitted to a couple that caught my interest and a rather high profile one that I didn't think I'd have a chance for. Who knew that the three would accept me? 
The conferences are:
Stage the Future II @ Arizona State University (March 7 to 8)- For this, I will be presenting a paper on the Doctor Who Proms of 2008, 2010, and 2013.
Orson Welles: A Centennial Celebration and Symposium @ Indiana University (April 30 to May 3) - Here I will be presenting a paper about the commercial and voiceover work Orson Welles did later in his life.
Great Writing 2015 @ Imperial College London (June 20 to 21) - I will be presenting a paper about the creative writing techniques of prisoners.
I am excited for all of these, but the most important one is easily the Great Writing 2015 conference, as that is at one of the world's most prestigious colleges and it will be for an international audience. There is also the possibility that the essays I present will be published in the future.

to PAX and helping us raise $55,419! </p>We are so grateful for your help and support!!<p>___________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>Hi, I’m Alison Armstrong. If you are already familiar with our work, then you already know how important it is! If not, then keep reading because I will explain more below! And we have a gift for you just for considering our request.<br/><br/>Either way, I need your help. We have always run our organization on a shoestring. We keep our costs low so that as many people as possible can benefit from our work. But now we are up to something big, and it is going to take some money to get it up and running. The payoff will be that we will be able to reach the entire world; dramatically leveraging our ability to affect the world, end unnecessary suffering, and embark on an era of human spirit and partnership. Please contribute to this effort financially if you can; every contribution builds momentum and energy toward taking our work global!<br/><br/>If you need to understand more about our work in order to make your decision, there is plenty of information out there! You may have heard me on the radio. Or seen me on TV. Or listened to a recording of mine on iTunes or YouTube. Or perhaps read the material or listened to these interviews on our website. We have a big commitment -- altering the culture of our world one human and one community at a time, by transforming the way men and women relate to themselves and each other. We do this by enabling people to see the instinctive sources of misunderstanding and discord between men and women, and then providing them with a new model of partnership that works not only in their personal world but also in every other area of their lives including work, family, community, and the planet. It is truly transforming.<br/><br/>I started PAX in 1995 with my dear friend Joan McClain, whose belief in the power of what I had discovered inspired me to share my discoveries. Since then we've opened the eyes and hearts of over 23,000 women in the Celebrating Men, Satisfying Women workshop, many on scholarship. And over 2,000 men have learned to see women in a new light, as courageous beings with minds, emotions, and perspectives that work in a way different from males. We have touched a lot of lives, and now it is time to take the work to a new level by reaching out across continents and cultures<br/>to build a global community of humans working in partnership.<br/><br/>To make this happen, we need to move beyond our local workshop format and make the information available <span>through Live Streaming, Webinars and a spectacular on-line community. Building this online capability takes more financial resources than we have, and that is why we are asking for your help. <br/><br/></span>Your generous contribution makes the following a reality:</p>
<ul>
<li>Development of a convenient, affordable online curriculum</li>
<li>Live streaming of PAX workshops and webinars to living rooms and universities around the world</li>
<li>Our online community membership site ~ ChoosingPartnership.com ~ where anyone ready to trade frustration for effective tools and empowering perspectives can <i>Participate</i> with like-minded and like-hearted men and women, <i>Collaborate</i> in new ways to apply our encyclopedia of understanding about men and women, and <i>Investigate</i> the frontiers of Partnership</li>

His name is Daniel Kish who lost his eyes at the age of 13months as a result of cancer,called retinoblastoma.  His parents always treated him like a normal child.  By the age of 15months he started 'Seeing' by making tongue clicks which echo back from objects enabling him to build a mental picture of his surroundings. Daniel is very targeted and determined. He went to normal schools and was able to ride a bike, explore parks, climb trees and cross roads with little to no help.  Eventually he obtained his own apartment and went to university where he received master degrees in developmental psychology and special education and then became the first totally blind person to be legally a Certified Orientation and Mobility Specialist  and to hold a National Blindness Professional Certification.                                                                                                                                        <br/><br/>Prominent neurologists wanting to study Daniels discovery placed him in a 3D MRI machine and recorded the echoes made from the clicks and it showed that the visual cortex part of the brain lights up making a connection with the audio cortex to allow him to form an image of the surroundings.  Daniel has proven humans that are blind, can echo locate, like bats, and called it Flash Sonar.  Once Daniel understood what was happening in his brain he knew positivity, without a doubt, that all blind people have the capability . Flash sonar is not really hearing from a neurological perspective; it is a peculiar sense all its own, trainable, surprisingly acute in experts, and capable of facilitating skilled echo locators to do many tasks that they couldn't do without the sense. Daniel trained other blind people to master Flash Sonar and in the year 2000 he stared a non-profit organization called World Access for the Blind in the USA, which to this day has taught more than 10,000 blind people in nearly 40 different countries how to see through sound.

The course is designed to not only learn Flash Sonar but push the subjects outside their normal range of activity during which they begin to learn and identify new objects and environments. They will walk the busy streets of Belize City and visit new places and events like a marine parade, a large supermarket, a museum and also go to the airport. They will go on expeditions outside of Belize City to caves to hear bats also echo locating using flash sonar to tell the difference between surface textures. They will walk in a forest and learn the sonic echoes of trees and or whatever else they find. They will go to the local vegetable market in Belmopan and swim in the river nearby at a national park.

</h3><p></p><p>Briefly, I
want to bring you up to date on what’s happening in my life: I am currently working at one of the world’s largest international publishing houses, Reed Elsevier. Shortly, I will be leaving Elsevier and working as a satellite
employee for a privately contracted publishing group called Graphic World. As a
satellite employee, I am uniquely positioned with the opportunity to work off
my laptop, potentially from anywhere within the U.S. As this is the case, I am
able to make a previously unlikely goal come to fruition-- attending Ecclesia.</p>
<p>Ecclesia
is a formation program led by the religious brothers and sisters of the
Community of St. John at the University of Mary in Bismarck, North Dakota. This
month-long program is centered on study of philosophy, theology and spiritual
formation. The opportunity to earn undergraduate, graduate or continuing
education credits is offered, all while experiencing a summer of prayer, study and

Briefly, I
want to bring you up to date on what’s happening in my life: I am currently working at one of the world’s largest international publishing houses, Reed Elsevier. Shortly, I will be leaving Elsevier and working as a satellite
employee for a privately contracted publishing group called Graphic World. As a
satellite employee, I am uniquely positioned with the opportunity to work off
my laptop, potentially from anywhere within the U.S. As this is the case, I am
able to make a previously unlikely goal come to fruition-- attending Ecclesia.
Ecclesia
is a formation program led by the religious brothers and sisters of the
Community of St. John at the University of Mary in Bismarck, North Dakota. This
month-long program is centered on study of philosophy, theology and spiritual
formation. The opportunity to earn undergraduate, graduate or continuing
education credits is offered, all while experiencing a summer of prayer, study and
fellowship with other young people from across the country. As a part of this
group, I will have the opportunity to be formed at Ecclesia with what is best
and most authentic in our Catholic Tradition: the life of the Church herself.  
Even
now, after graduating from USD, I still consider myself a student. As such, I
want to continue my learning in a way that it will benefit me personally, as
well as preparing me to give back to the greater Catholic community that I am
involved in, as a leader and role model.What is Needed:Simply broken down, I will need help in raising the following:Ecclesia expense: 950.00Airfare expenses: approx. 600.00Living expenses: approx. 1500.00Fee Expense: 200.00Total: approx. 3300.00I will personally be contributing upwards of 500.00 on top of my goal, and possibly more if I am unable to meet my goal.

</strong></p>
<b><strong>Inspired by the strong alumni donor systems built into most Academic
institutions in the US, we would like to set in place a
private, transparent, international online donation campaign to support
exceptional students with financial needs from St Sava, the oldest and very prestigious high
school in Bucharest, Romania. Fellowships will help defray initial college
costs for the selected students. Importantly, this campaign is aimed to set a
precedent for the Romanian education system, as our goal is to build trust in the power of private donations. </strong></b>
<b>
</b><p></p>
<h3><b>Who
We Are</b></h3>

We represent a group of alumni of
the St Sava high school (Colegiul National Sf Sava). St Sava high school is the oldest and one of the most prestigious high schools in Bucharest, Romania, established in year 1688. We - the alumni - have various professions (professors, programmers, businessmen or women, etc.), and now live in various parts of the world, in Romania, Europe, US, Australia. We have recently reconnected, as we are celebrating our respective 15th and 20th St Sava high school reunions, and would like to set an important precedent by starting this ""American style"" fundraising campaign for our high school. <br/><br/>We would like to invite our Romanian and international friends to become part of this exciting campaign. We are grateful for any help we can get in our quest, as your donations of any size will make a very big difference for our worthy cause.<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><strong></strong>We aim to raise at least $2000, and hopefully much more! Our
fundraising effort is dedicated to providing fellowships to exceptional
12th grade - graduating students - of St Sava high school who are <i>financially in need</i>. Each fellowship (a
$1000 minimum) is meant to help the student defray some of the initial costs
(books, transportation, student fees) of college. The students will be chosen via a competition open to all, advertised in the spring semester 2015 in the St Sava high school. We are looking for all-around exceptional students with good grades and impressive CVs. Some of our donors (see ""Perks"") and campaign volunteers will be invited to choose the students in a fully transparent fashion. Any student can submit a CV and a Personal Statement; these materials 
are reviewed by the campaign volunteers and donors with voting power; the winning 2 or 3 
students split the total funds in equal parts. <br/></p>

We will provide a few unique perks for our donors (See the Perks section for details), depending on the donation level. Our donors will be
acknowledged in the fellowship letters to our chosen students, will receive updates on the selection of students and can participate actively in the selection of student fellows.<strong> <br/></strong><br/><i> </i>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>
In a country in which the average salary per
economy is below $500/month, and some people are paid $200/month, your donation can have a sizable economic impact for graduating high school students coming from less privileged backgrounds.<br/></p>
<p>Importantly, your donation will also be
a first step towards building and connecting a community that cares about
improving education and opportunities for young high school graduates in Romania, and an active alumni community for the oldest Bucharest high school. <br/></p>
<p>Those of us who have spent time in Universities
or businesses outside Romania, and particularly in the US, have understood the
critical importance that a strong Alumni group and private donations can have
in supporting educational institutions and endeavors, and students with financial need. We would like to set
in place for the first time such a private, fully transparent, donation campaign, and by doing so
<i>set an important precedent in the Romanian education system</i>. Indiegogo is
the perfect conduit for such an open, transparent experiment.</p>
<p>If successful, we plan to broaden our fundraising efforts in future 
years in order to establish continuity for these student fellowships, 
and have a <i>longer-term impact.</i><br/></p>
<i></i><ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>
</p>
<p>Spread the word ! We
want to get people talking and as excited as we are about our project! You can use the
Indiegogo share tools for this. <br/></p>
<p>Additionally, we are
asking St Sava alumni and friends to support our project by dedicating their time and
energy to help present and future fundraising efforts for our former
high-school. Please contact <a href=""mailto:playperch@gmail.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">irinamarinov@gmail.com </a>for further information on

We hope that you'll join us in helping give Carolyn a pretty spectacular Christmas present this year and a pretty fantastic experience to boot.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>How does magic work? Not the magic of deception and misdirection but the magic of the heart. How does magic bring joy to the hearts of both the giver and receiver of a gift? When we give something, be it, money, love, time, peace or joy, we realise that we already had it and when we give it away, it purifies and frees the mind. The receiver of the gift benefits and we lose the boundary between “them” and “us” and our shared reality becomes stronger. The love for humanity grows and fear weakens. Give instead of take. Offer instead of expect. These truths create the magic that can save our world.</p>
<p>Would you like to help me bring the gift of magic to a very special boy in India?</p>
<p>Uday is 17 years old. When he was young he lived in the mountains of Mussoorie in a tiny shoebox of a concrete room with barely any light. His father carried stones or people on his back for a living. Any kind of future was bleak yet Uday was a happy and smiling young boy with giant eyes and joyful giggle. His family sent him to an NGO hostel in Rishikesh where he could get food, education, medical care and the attention he craved.</p>
<p>I have known Uday for almost 10 years now. Not once have I seen him angry. He takes his studies seriously and is always in the 90s coming first or second in his class. Just recently he completed 10th class with 100%. He is a star amongst stars, helping others with their chores, never complaining. He is a superb cricket player, a natural leader who effortlessly receives great respect from his peers, younger children and adults alike. His natural wisdom, happiness and generosity denote his spiritual nature and the kindness and sensitivity he shows to his girlfriend make him a wonderful role model.</p>
<p>I have been sponsoring Uday for his education the last two years and now as he is entering 11th class, with just two years of studies to go, his childhood dream of becoming a commercial pilot is still strong. As pilot training is extremely expensive Uday has been told by many people for a long time to forget his dream. I am hoping, that with a little magic, we can help his dream come true. If any young man has it in him to make a positive change in our troubled world, it is Uday. When I told him it would cost USD58,000 for the full training, his eyes and face dropped; a dream crashed. From his background, USD1,000 is way out of touch, forget USD58,000. When I told him that I would try my best to help and that he was worth it, his eyes and face began to shine with humble radiance.</p>

<div>
<p>The full cost for commercial pilot training is USD58,000.  A little money has already been raised and we are desperately searching everywhere and anywhere for help.  In this Indiegogo campaign, we are seeking to raise USD5,000.  This money will go straight into a fixed deposit which receives 9% interest for the next 2 years while Uday finishes school.  Thus your contribution will be even higher in due course.  USD5,000 is enough to cover approximately 80 of the 200 hours of practice flying time required to obtain a commercial license.  If this campaign is not successful, any funds raised will still go towards Uday's pilot training, as our team is determined to make Uday's dream come true. </p>

<h3>Our Goal</h3>
<div>In anticipation of this campaign, we have begun fundraising among our family and friends and have already raised $1,450.00!  Our original goal was $8000, but in light of people's amazing generosity and excitement about the Rhythm Board, we've lowered our goal to $6,550.00.  Thank you to everyone who has contributed already, and thank you in advance for supporting this project!</div>

<h3>What's a Rhythm Board?</h3>
<div>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1141185/files/20150109233706-Screen_Shot_2014-12-07_at_10.56.34_AM.png?1420875426"" src="""" style=""width: 301.5px; height: 201px;""/> </p>
<p>The Rhythm Board is a tactile, puzzle-like tool designed to teach rhythm in an intuitive way.  The board and pieces are all made out of wood and are sized relative to the length of the note.  For example,  a quarter note is 1/2 the size of a half note, and 1/4 the size of a whole note.  The board itself has four 1-beat spaces on the top, and two 4-beat spaces underneath.  This way a student can begin with understanding how a single beat is made up and then how those beats are combined and relate to one another.  There are four full beats of each note, and each piece has the note on one side and its equivalent rest on the other, with bright colors to make the distinction clear for the student.  Because the design is simple, students easily grasp the function of each rhythm and the relationship of one rhythm to the next.</p>
<p> <b>The Look</b>  - The pictures here are of the most recent prototype, but look slightly different from the final product.  Because we have decided to go with laser cutting for precision, the edges of the board, spaces, and pieces will be black from where the laser burns the wood. It will not be available any other way, as cutting it with the laser is the best way to ensure that all the pieces fit easily and reliably.  Here's a sample of what the edges will look like; I can't wait to see how the clean black edges look on the board itself!</p>

<div>The Rhythm Board is for anyone teaching or learning music that would like to have more fun and more success understanding rhythm.</div>
<div><ul>
<li>
<b>General Music Teachers -</b> instead of trying to write everything on a chalk board, the Rhythm Board can be held up and shown to the class at large, or given to individuals or small groups to work with.</li>
<li>
<b>Private Lesson Instructors -</b> work one-on-one with students to teach a variety of both simple and complex concepts.</li>
<li>
<b>Montessori Classrooms -</b> keep available for students to play with individually or teach other children what they've learned.</li>
<li>
<b>Parents -</b> have at home as an introduction to music and rhythm for their children.</li>
<li>
<b>Students - </b>use this during practicing to figure out rhythms in their music or to write their own music.</li>
</ul></div>
<h3>Short Summary - <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">How the Rhythm Board Came to Be</span>
</h3> <p>As a violin teacher, I am always looking for the most natural and intuitive ways to help my students learn new skills and concepts.  As other teachers will relate to, whether working with very young students, middle and high schoolers or adults, there seems to be a broad sense of confusion about rhythm. This got me wondering if there was some deficiency in how rhythm was being taught.  Looking around,  the only rhythm teaching aids widely available were flash cards and black boards - tools that only encourage repetition.  Students needed an engaging medium that would convey the relationship of each rhythmic value to a beat and show how those values relate to one another and can be combined. </p>
<p>After visiting a Montessori classroom, I was inspired by their self-correcting teaching tools, and sat down to make my own tool I called the Rhythm Box.  I took it to my students and to the Montessori classroom and was blown away by how quickly students were catching on and how much they were able to figure out without any help!  Immediately my little box caught the attention of my students' parents and other teachers and they encouraged me to produce and patent it.  </p>
<p>It's been almost a year since then, and my original rhythm box has become the Rhythm Board, and it is officially ""patent pending"" as of December 31!  My husband and I have funded all of the legal work and production so far, but to get the first run of products made I need your help!  </p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p> Playing with the Rhythm Board guides students to the vital understanding of how each rhythm relates to the next and how they all relate to a musical beat.  My goal is to make the success I've seen with my students available to every music educator, parent, student, and novice. </p>
<p>I already have orders coming in for the Rhythm Board, but at this point, I have no products to sell. This is where you come in! Your financial contributions will pay for the Rhythm Board's first production run which will fill these initial orders in addition to creating a supply that will be sold through this campaign and commercially. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> You will also help fund initial marketing and PR and advance future </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">possibilities</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> for the Rhythm Board.   I am already working with local music, educational, and toy stores to build a local awareness, but your help will allow me to get the Rhythm Board into the hands of larger, music-specific retailers who could introduce it to a much wider audience.  </span></p>
<p>If we make our full goal, then I'll also be able to pursue other variations of the Rhythm Board. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> The first would be a Rhythm Board specifically designed for Montessori classrooms - one that is more natural looking and includes a wooden tray so students can easily transport the board to and from their work stations.  I've also been approached about making a Rhythm Board app, which could really broaden the exposure of this tool. </span></p>

</div><div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<div>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><b>Fit - </b>One of the biggest challenges we have left is manufacturing a board and its pieces so that they fit together easily regardless of </span>their<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> configuration. This was an issue in the last prototype because of a less </span>precise cutting process<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> but we've since gone to laser cutting for a more exact cut, and have opened up the space in which the pieces will sit.  The people I have helping me with this are amazing, and I have full faith in their results!  Not to worry, your Rhythm Board will be perfect :)</span>
</div>
<div><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><b>Marketing - </b>Another challenge is marketing.  There are a few key music companies, teaching organizations, and Montessori suppliers that I'd love to work with, and I am confident that the Rhythm Board will appeal to these companies if I can get it into their hands. With your help, and my network within the music community, I will be able to get the Rhythm Board to these companies and give them a chance to see what a great product this is!</span></div>
<div>
<b>Keeping it Local - </b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">I am very proud that every detail of the Rhythm Board is made locally!  Every person I have collaborated with,</span> from the printer and cutter to the videographer/editor for the video at the top of this campaign, is part of a small local business<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">.  I love that I know the person that slides the blank wooden sheet through the printer and that I'm the one who picks up the printed sheet and takes it across town to be cut into Rhythm Boards!  </span>

<i>* Korinthia Klein - Korinthian Violin Shop </i>- As a musician, teacher, Montessori mom, and friend, Kory has been my No. 1 guinea pig.  Every time there was a new change or detail, I took it to her first to get her honest feedback and suggestions.  She even had her kids play with it to get their thoughts!</div><div>
<i>* Travis Leanna, Milwaukee Strings Studio</i> - Travis is my husband and has believed in me and supported this project from its very inception.  He has encouraged me when we hit snags in production or when expenses were looming, and he has celebrated with me when each new prototype got better and better and when we received our first financial endorsement.  </div><div>Thank you to everyone who has helped out with this project, the Rhythm Board owes its success to all of you!</div><h3>Updates</h3><div>Check out the ""Updates"" button at the top for more teaching videos and other updates!</div></div>","Our Goal
In anticipation of this campaign, we have begun fundraising among our family and friends and have already raised $1,450.00!  Our original goal was $8000, but in light of people's amazing generosity and excitement about the Rhythm Board, we've lowered our goal to $6,550.00.  Thank you to everyone who has contributed already, and thank you in advance for supporting this project!

The Rhythm Board is a tactile, puzzle-like tool designed to teach rhythm in an intuitive way.  The board and pieces are all made out of wood and are sized relative to the length of the note.  For example,  a quarter note is 1/2 the size of a half note, and 1/4 the size of a whole note.  The board itself has four 1-beat spaces on the top, and two 4-beat spaces underneath.  This way a student can begin with understanding how a single beat is made up and then how those beats are combined and relate to one another.  There are four full beats of each note, and each piece has the note on one side and its equivalent rest on the other, with bright colors to make the distinction clear for the student.  Because the design is simple, students easily grasp the function of each rhythm and the relationship of one rhythm to the next.
 The Look  - The pictures here are of the most recent prototype, but look slightly different from the final product.  Because we have decided to go with laser cutting for precision, the edges of the board, spaces, and pieces will be black from where the laser burns the wood. It will not be available any other way, as cutting it with the laser is the best way to ensure that all the pieces fit easily and reliably.  Here's a sample of what the edges will look like; I can't wait to see how the clean black edges look on the board itself!

     



Who is it for?

The Rhythm Board is for anyone teaching or learning music that would like to have more fun and more success understanding rhythm.


General Music Teachers - instead of trying to write everything on a chalk board, the Rhythm Board can be held up and shown to the class at large, or given to individuals or small groups to work with.

Private Lesson Instructors - work one-on-one with students to teach a variety of both simple and complex concepts.

Montessori Classrooms - keep available for students to play with individually or teach other children what they've learned.

Parents - have at home as an introduction to music and rhythm for their children.

Students - use this during practicing to figure out rhythms in their music or to write their own music.

Short Summary - How the Rhythm Board Came to Be
 As a violin teacher, I am always looking for the most natural and intuitive ways to help my students learn new skills and concepts.  As other teachers will relate to, whether working with very young students, middle and high schoolers or adults, there seems to be a broad sense of confusion about rhythm. This got me wondering if there was some deficiency in how rhythm was being taught.  Looking around,  the only rhythm teaching aids widely available were flash cards and black boards - tools that only encourage repetition.  Students needed an engaging medium that would convey the relationship of each rhythmic value to a beat and show how those values relate to one another and can be combined. 
After visiting a Montessori classroom, I was inspired by their self-correcting teaching tools, and sat down to make my own tool I called the Rhythm Box.  I took it to my students and to the Montessori classroom and was blown away by how quickly students were catching on and how much they were able to figure out without any help!  Immediately my little box caught the attention of my students' parents and other teachers and they encouraged me to produce and patent it.  
It's been almost a year since then, and my original rhythm box has become the Rhythm Board, and it is officially ""patent pending"" as of December 31!  My husband and I have funded all of the legal work and production so far, but to get the first run of products made I need your help!     What We Need & What You Get  Playing with the Rhythm Board guides students to the vital understanding of how each rhythm relates to the next and how they all relate to a musical beat.  My goal is to make the success I've seen with my students available to every music educator, parent, student, and novice. 
I already have orders coming in for the Rhythm Board, but at this point, I have no products to sell. This is where you come in! Your financial contributions will pay for the Rhythm Board's first production run which will fill these initial orders in addition to creating a supply that will be sold through this campaign and commercially.  You will also help fund initial marketing and PR and advance future possibilities for the Rhythm Board.   I am already working with local music, educational, and toy stores to build a local awareness, but your help will allow me to get the Rhythm Board into the hands of larger, music-specific retailers who could introduce it to a much wider audience.  
If we make our full goal, then I'll also be able to pursue other variations of the Rhythm Board.  The first would be a Rhythm Board specifically designed for Montessori classrooms - one that is more natural looking and includes a wooden tray so students can easily transport the board to and from their work stations.  I've also been approached about making a Rhythm Board app, which could really broaden the exposure of this tool.

    Risks & Challenges

Fit - One of the biggest challenges we have left is manufacturing a board and its pieces so that they fit together easily regardless of their configuration. This was an issue in the last prototype because of a less precise cutting process but we've since gone to laser cutting for a more exact cut, and have opened up the space in which the pieces will sit.  The people I have helping me with this are amazing, and I have full faith in their results!  Not to worry, your Rhythm Board will be perfect :)

Marketing - Another challenge is marketing.  There are a few key music companies, teaching organizations, and Montessori suppliers that I'd love to work with, and I am confident that the Rhythm Board will appeal to these companies if I can get it into their hands. With your help, and my network within the music community, I will be able to get the Rhythm Board to these companies and give them a chance to see what a great product this is!

Keeping it Local - I am very proud that every detail of the Rhythm Board is made locally!  Every person I have collaborated with, from the printer and cutter to the videographer/editor for the video at the top of this campaign, is part of a small local business.  I love that I know the person that slides the blank wooden sheet through the printer and that I'm the one who picks up the printed sheet and takes it across town to be cut into Rhythm Boards!  


Other Ways You Can Help


The Rhythm Board has come this far because of people like you who have generously given their time and energy to this project.  The most overwhelming support, in fact, has come from people who had no previous connection to me.  They believed in this product and have worked tirelessly to make it a reality.  Instead of giving funds, they donated services and expertise and have been the best cheerleading team I could ask for.
If you can donate funds at any level, thank you! - Grateful doesn't even begin to cut it!  If, however your donation is in time and energy, helping to spread the word about this great tool and promote it, you are joining a truly amazing team of giving and generous supporters that has been the heart and soul of Rhythm Board from the very start!  
Thank You!As I mentioned before, there are some amazing individuals who have gone above and beyond in their support for this project.  If you are in the Milwaukee area, I strongly encourage you to contact any of these people and businesses if you ever are in need of their services.  
* Vera Brissman, Morning Star Montessori - Her stunning classroom, enthusiastic energy and the opportunity to work with her students were the inspiration for this tool.
* Dan Merkel, Design Build Workshop - Dan is responsible for getting this project off the ground and putting the people in place to make it a reality.  He did all the initial graphic design and measurements and introduced me to Scott, the guy who would be critically instrumental in the physical production of the Rhythm Board.  In addition, it was Dan's family that introduced me to the Montessori teacher and classroom that motivated me in the first place!
* Scott Anders, PSG Enterprises - Scott has undertaken all of the details pertaining to the actual production of the Rhythm Board: the printing, cutting and packaging.  He has spent countless hours and his own resources helping to make this idea a reality.
* Bethany Michaels, Flint Box Films - Bethany did all of the interview filming for this campaign as well as all of the video editing.  Her input and skills have been invaluable.
* Korinthia Klein - Korinthian Violin Shop - As a musician, teacher, Montessori mom, and friend, Kory has been my No. 1 guinea pig.  Every time there was a new change or detail, I took it to her first to get her honest feedback and suggestions.  She even had her kids play with it to get their thoughts!
* Travis Leanna, Milwaukee Strings Studio - Travis is my husband and has believed in me and supported this project from its very inception.  He has encouraged me when we hit snags in production or when expenses were looming, and he has celebrated with me when each new prototype got better and better and when we received our first financial endorsement.  Thank you to everyone who has helped out with this project, the Rhythm Board owes its success to all of you!UpdatesCheck out the ""Updates"" button at the top for more teaching videos and other updates!",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

</h3><p>With albums, shirts, posters and more, I'll speak, perform, and hold workshops at schools <b>nationwide</b>. We'll also be visiting youth organizations and performing at showcases along the way, connecting with as many people as possible! We're going to bring positive Hip-Hop to places where the very idea is <b>obscure</b>. Workshops not only teach the importance of <b>positivity</b>, but they'll also cover the basics of song writing, <b>healthy social behaviors</b> and universal life lessons. We're living in a time where there is an enormous mental gap between the teacher and the students. Students are influenced by <b>pseudo rap gangsters</b> who most educators don't even know exist. So I teach the students the importance of education AND, more importantly, the importance of <b>being yourself</b>! Imagine the ridicule you'd face being the ONLY student out of 1000 who's NOT so into the latest <b>gangster rapper</b> the radio's introduced. Parents take this for granted but kids are frequently <b>ostracized and bullied</b> based on their musical preference. Like clockwork, negative music creates negative situations, and shunning someone's favorite <b>""IDOL""</b> is likely to land you in the ""not so cool"" crowd. <b>Peer pressure</b> of this magnitude is usually unbearable, leaving targeted students with the option to conform or remain a social outcast. Some students figure they can at least ""tolerate"" the ignorant music and <b>pretend</b> to like the latest rapper for the sake of ""fitting in."" Not only do they subconsciously fall victim to the <b>second-hand negativity</b>, they're also enabling the destructive music by inadvertently condoning it. This is easily solved by giving them tasteful music that more than one group of people will love.</p><p>By contributing to this campaign you'll be changing the world,  <b>LITERALLY</b>. No need to wait for radio to adjust, no need for strict rules and regulations, no need for rallies or protests. We'll just provide a SUITABLE alternative to what they currently hear. They'll thank you for it, now AND later.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/667882/files/20140622234143-Eric_a2.jpg?1403505703"" src="""" style=""font-style: italic; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;""/>*WBL (Words, Beats &amp; Life) is a youth organization I work for which is run by Mazi Mutafa.

This is one of my students.*</p><h3>What It Will Take</h3><p>We calculated a realistic goal of <b>$30,000</b> for this campaign.<b> </b>That's what we'd need at bare minimum to take the tour <b>Nationwide</b>. With less we can still take the movement to new places. The reach will be limited, however. Likewise, if we <b>exceed</b> our goal the reach of the campaign will be extended. These numbers are based on the idea of me traveling alone. To bring a videographer or musicians along will require more support on your behalf! We can do it. <b>I believe in</b> <b>YOU</b>... thank you for believing in me! </p><p>Let's take this <b>global, </b>we can literally ""<b>CHANGE THE WORLD</b>""... have <b>faith</b>.</p><ul>
<li>Reaching the posted goal of $10,000 will allow us to take workshops to various schools in the DC area with stickers and CDs for teachers and students we meet! <b>There's nothing more rewarding than seeing the smile on a child's face when you give them an autographed sticker or CD to take home!</b> A signed business card usually blows their mind, but a sticker would be infinitely more effective =)</li>
<li>Doubling the posted goal and raising $20,000 will give us the ability to take those CDs, stickers and workshops considerably further. Stepping outside of the Washington DC area, I'll be able to connect with youth and teachers in places like <b>New York</b>, <b>Philadelphia</b>, <b>North Carolina</b>. Out-of-state workshops and performances tend to leave a larger impact on young audiences. There's an added sense of mystery and mystique when youth are introduced to a presenter (or ANYTHING for that matter) that came from a place where they've never been. That in itself becomes a point of interest during the workshop. The phrase ""<b><i>taking me places I've never been</i></b><i>!</i>"" begins to really resonate during out-of-state engagements. We'll also be able to add beautiful custom made t-shirts to the list of goodies to share!</li>
<li>At $30,000 we're fully fit to start reaching youth nationally with CDs, stickers, t-shirts, posters and <b>MORE</b> on a literal <b>""path of enlightenment""</b>, shedding light and knowledge of positivity the entire time! Reaching youth in places which may have never encountered true Hip-Hop, then eventually returning to <b>Washington, DC</b> where my very existence will shine as a beacon of success to the numerous youth who are <b>likely to have never left the District of Columbia</b>. What better way to inspire them to value their education? What better way to show them the value of social skills and <b>critical thinking</b>? There are so many other things that must be accounted for, so I was sure to leave some of the budget to cover those things. <b>Gas</b> must be purchased. <b>Tolls</b> must be paid, and the list goes on and on. </li>
<li>I must stress again that this level of youth advocacy deserves far more than the ""minimum!"" <b>This tour will change COUNTLESS lives.</b> Anyone who experiences it directly will talk about it for years to come, I promise. My goal, however, is to leave an impression that lasts a <b>LIFETIME</b>. The age old question stands: ""<b>If a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?</b>"" We want those who aren't there to experience the journey! We would love to document as much of the journey as possible. We'd love to share the vision with students and music lovers in other countries. <b>Quality cinematic</b> equipment is FAR from inexpensive, and to maintain the average person's standard of video quality we'd expect to spend $1500+ on the camera alone. That doesn't include feeding and housing the camera man for the duration of this bi-coastal journey. The trip itself will take anywhere between <b>1-2 months</b> to run its full course and anyone who travels knows just how costly <b>living on the road</b> can be. It's absolutely vital that we keep in mind that the unexpected can (and quite often WILL) happen. A flat tire or ANYTHING of that nature can throw off plans severely when working with such an exact budget that lacks a cushion or room for adjustments. <b>Nobody plans a trip to a foreign place with EXACT CHANGE. </b>This should be no different.<br/><br/><b>Currently we do not have ANY guaranteed press outlets or publicity agents. As a result, after reaching the $30,000 goal we will invest a small amount in different forms of advertising and press coverage to ensure that the world knows what's happening! To remove any concern you may have about the funds raised being used efficiently, one of my team members, a financial analyst, will work with me to manage the use of all funds raised. A financial report will be available for campaign supporters upon request.<br/></b><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/>No matter the challenge, we can do this! </span><b style=""background-color: initial;"">""It takes a nation to raise a village""</b><span style=""background-color: initial;"">. In 2012, the population of Washington DC was 632,323. Even with just $1 donations that's more than TWENTY times what we need. We can do this. <b>No sweat.</b></span>
</li>
</ul><h3></h3><h3>The Perks</h3>The motivation behind visiting schools and working with students should <b>ALWAYS </b>be to give <b>THEM</b> something, to leave <b>THEM</b> with new knowledge, to empower. That goes for any kind of educator, every subject, any theory. The prime beneficiary of this campaign will be the youth we meet along the way! <b>The more we raise, the more we can do for the kids we'll work with</b>! We've taken time to think of ways contributors can leave their own personal <b>mark on history</b> while helping a great cause AND snagging some priceless rewards in the process. <p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><br/><b>It's a Win x Win situation!</b><br/><br/>The biggest thing to remember is that we want to leave the kids something to hold on to. As a kid, how could you forget when there are stickers from the workshop on everybody's stuff? How could you forget when you have a beautiful painting hanging in your school's main hallway? <b>We'll make sure that the kids never forget how the positive Hip-Hop made them feel</b>. If we can get the entire school talking about positive Hip-Hop the kids will begin holding each other accountable!<br/><br/></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/679527/files/20140627121112-IMG_20140626_230531.jpg?1403896272"" src="""" style=""""/></p><b style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: x-large; line-height: 30px;"">The Impact</b><br/><p></p><p>I've come to realize that most people think that change won't happen unless it's something that <b>BILLIONS</b> of people join together to do... That is <b>NOT </b>true for popular culture. With popular culture, the most dynamic changes start with just <b>ONE </b>person doing something small yet noticeable. Everybody has influences, everybody has somebody they looked up to. Right now the youth want to be like the rappers they see on <b>mainstream </b>TV/radio... But there aren't any positive rappers in that mainstream arena. Nobody positive is creating what they seek while retaining a constructive perspective. <b>WHEN this tour succeeds</b> we will set a new example, and even if just <b>ONE </b>child decides to start being positive as a result, the cycle will begin to break. This list of organizations I've worked with grows constantly, and I strive to leave an open line of communication with the youth I meet via social networks. I've realized the kids only emulate what <b>works. </b>They need a <b>reason </b>to be positive. If they have someone who's not ""cool"" and or not ""successful"" telling them that they should be positive, they will turn away. They need someone who will show them the benefits of a positive outlook. When people have a positive outlook, they're more receptive to instruction, easier to connect with and more likely to be patient enough to process new information. Using positive Hip-Hop, we can <b>bridge the gap between teachers and students</b>, parents and children, the future leaders and the current leaders. I'm already doing it. Let's take it nationwide! </p><h3>Going Against the Grain</h3><p>History has always (in its own strange way) rewarded those who travel <b>off the beaten path.</b> My story has been no different.  I may not be world famous or have my music spinning on the radio daily... but when I show up at the schools, and those kids smile... When I hear them cheer, when they unite and clap in unison... When teachers have to <b>drag</b> them out of the presentation room because they refuse to leave before they get the autograph or picture that they've waited so diligently for... <b>That's when I remember it's worth it.</b> That's when I know it's working. The best part about my plan is that I've already done all the leg work. If you Google me, plenty material will pop up. I've worked with INCREDIBLE musicians and artists - some known nationally, others known internationally, some approaching global status. No matter the song subject, no matter who I collaborate with, my contribution will always contain substance and remain curse-free, setting an example for my young fans!</p><p>The only risk I face with this plan is the possibility that the <b>news of the campaign may not spread to the public</b>. I admit, problems arise whenever I discuss expanding the movement, simply because <b>people don't see the TRUE value in positive Hip-Hop</b>. People are reluctant to help because they don't understand how <b>Youth Popular Culture</b> affects them. People don't take the movement seriously until they witness it first-hand. Teachers, parents, even government officials are often skeptical because this method is foreign to them... they've forgotten that in the beginning, <b>somebody was able to bond with them through something that they were interested in at the time</b>. They underestimate the power and reach Hip-Hop has... a culture that started in the slums of New York City which has now has spawned B-Boys, Emcees and DJ's <b>worldwide </b>recreating what happened when it all started.</p><p>Ironically, I get around these obstacles by doing more and more youth work. I overcome these challenges by making more songs and attending more community events. I make connections constantly, and doors open. I'm incredibly diligent. It <b>will</b> work.</p><h3>Tell a Friend</h3><p>Everyone assumes that they need some sort of extravagant or elaborate plan when it comes to spreading the word. <b>We're all guilty of it</b>... <b>Start with your CLOSE FRIENDS and FAMILY</b>. Even if you grandmother, aunt or uncle can't support, they just might tell somebody else who will. Have you ever noticed how when you're telling a close friend about something you're passionate about, you never have to ""think"" about the method of explaining it? Sometimes it just comes out as a jumbled pile of words mixed with smiles and laughter... <b>THAT is more convincing than a 60-second spiel will ever be</b> when talking to close friends and family... because your friends know that if it's something that <b>YOU'RE</b> passionate about, then maybe THEY should be excited about it, too. Good energy is <b>contagious</b>. My music is changing the lives of people who hear it everywhere. Be encouraged!</p><p>Share this campaign via email. Talk about this movement at work. Post this on facebook. Tweet the progress on twitter! <b>Tell anybody you know who has kids</b>, tell their teachers, tell your mentors, role models and advisers... The world needs to know. Be sure to use the IndieGoGo share tools!</p><h3>THANK YOU ALL SO VERY MUCH. </h3><p><b>We're changing the world. </b>LITTLE, By little.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p></div>","""If only Hip-Hop was what it used to be""Most parents go to bed thinking their children are safe just because they bring home good grades and have never been arrested...

I have nodoubt that Javier's voice and music will impact our children and makepositive change in the world."" A massive ""selfie"" I took with the graduating class this year at GDS, they show me so much love!
The Plan
With albums, shirts, posters and more, I'll speak, perform, and hold workshops at schools nationwide. We'll also be visiting youth organizations and performing at showcases along the way, connecting with as many people as possible! We're going to bring positive Hip-Hop to places where the very idea is obscure. Workshops not only teach the importance of positivity, but they'll also cover the basics of song writing, healthy social behaviors and universal life lessons. We're living in a time where there is an enormous mental gap between the teacher and the students. Students are influenced by pseudo rap gangsters who most educators don't even know exist. So I teach the students the importance of education AND, more importantly, the importance of being yourself! Imagine the ridicule you'd face being the ONLY student out of 1000 who's NOT so into the latest gangster rapper the radio's introduced. Parents take this for granted but kids are frequently ostracized and bullied based on their musical preference. Like clockwork, negative music creates negative situations, and shunning someone's favorite ""IDOL"" is likely to land you in the ""not so cool"" crowd. Peer pressure of this magnitude is usually unbearable, leaving targeted students with the option to conform or remain a social outcast. Some students figure they can at least ""tolerate"" the ignorant music and pretend to like the latest rapper for the sake of ""fitting in."" Not only do they subconsciously fall victim to the second-hand negativity, they're also enabling the destructive music by inadvertently condoning it. This is easily solved by giving them tasteful music that more than one group of people will love.By contributing to this campaign you'll be changing the world,  LITERALLY. No need to wait for radio to adjust, no need for strict rules and regulations, no need for rallies or protests. We'll just provide a SUITABLE alternative to what they currently hear. They'll thank you for it, now AND later.*WBL (Words, Beats & Life) is a youth organization I work for which is run by Mazi Mutafa. At WBL I teach the art of emceeing. This is one of my students.*What It Will TakeWe calculated a realistic goal of $30,000 for this campaign. That's what we'd need at bare minimum to take the tour Nationwide. With less we can still take the movement to new places. The reach will be limited, however. Likewise, if we exceed our goal the reach of the campaign will be extended. These numbers are based on the idea of me traveling alone. To bring a videographer or musicians along will require more support on your behalf! We can do it. I believe in YOU... thank you for believing in me! Let's take this global, we can literally ""CHANGE THE WORLD""... have faith.
Reaching the posted goal of $10,000 will allow us to take workshops to various schools in the DC area with stickers and CDs for teachers and students we meet! There's nothing more rewarding than seeing the smile on a child's face when you give them an autographed sticker or CD to take home! A signed business card usually blows their mind, but a sticker would be infinitely more effective =)
Doubling the posted goal and raising $20,000 will give us the ability to take those CDs, stickers and workshops considerably further. Stepping outside of the Washington DC area, I'll be able to connect with youth and teachers in places like New York, Philadelphia, North Carolina. Out-of-state workshops and performances tend to leave a larger impact on young audiences. There's an added sense of mystery and mystique when youth are introduced to a presenter (or ANYTHING for that matter) that came from a place where they've never been. That in itself becomes a point of interest during the workshop. The phrase ""taking me places I've never been!"" begins to really resonate during out-of-state engagements. We'll also be able to add beautiful custom made t-shirts to the list of goodies to share!
At $30,000 we're fully fit to start reaching youth nationally with CDs, stickers, t-shirts, posters and MORE on a literal ""path of enlightenment"", shedding light and knowledge of positivity the entire time! Reaching youth in places which may have never encountered true Hip-Hop, then eventually returning to Washington, DC where my very existence will shine as a beacon of success to the numerous youth who are likely to have never left the District of Columbia. What better way to inspire them to value their education? What better way to show them the value of social skills and critical thinking? There are so many other things that must be accounted for, so I was sure to leave some of the budget to cover those things. Gas must be purchased. Tolls must be paid, and the list goes on and on. 
I must stress again that this level of youth advocacy deserves far more than the ""minimum!"" This tour will change COUNTLESS lives. Anyone who experiences it directly will talk about it for years to come, I promise. My goal, however, is to leave an impression that lasts a LIFETIME. The age old question stands: ""If a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?"" We want those who aren't there to experience the journey! We would love to document as much of the journey as possible. We'd love to share the vision with students and music lovers in other countries. Quality cinematic equipment is FAR from inexpensive, and to maintain the average person's standard of video quality we'd expect to spend $1500+ on the camera alone. That doesn't include feeding and housing the camera man for the duration of this bi-coastal journey. The trip itself will take anywhere between 1-2 months to run its full course and anyone who travels knows just how costly living on the road can be. It's absolutely vital that we keep in mind that the unexpected can (and quite often WILL) happen. A flat tire or ANYTHING of that nature can throw off plans severely when working with such an exact budget that lacks a cushion or room for adjustments. Nobody plans a trip to a foreign place with EXACT CHANGE. This should be no different.Currently we do not have ANY guaranteed press outlets or publicity agents. As a result, after reaching the $30,000 goal we will invest a small amount in different forms of advertising and press coverage to ensure that the world knows what's happening! To remove any concern you may have about the funds raised being used efficiently, one of my team members, a financial analyst, will work with me to manage the use of all funds raised. A financial report will be available for campaign supporters upon request.No matter the challenge, we can do this! ""It takes a nation to raise a village"". In 2012, the population of Washington DC was 632,323. Even with just $1 donations that's more than TWENTY times what we need. We can do this. No sweat.

The PerksThe motivation behind visiting schools and working with students should ALWAYS be to give THEM something, to leave THEM with new knowledge, to empower. That goes for any kind of educator, every subject, any theory. The prime beneficiary of this campaign will be the youth we meet along the way! The more we raise, the more we can do for the kids we'll work with! We've taken time to think of ways contributors can leave their own personal mark on history while helping a great cause AND snagging some priceless rewards in the process. It's a Win x Win situation!The biggest thing to remember is that we want to leave the kids something to hold on to. As a kid, how could you forget when there are stickers from the workshop on everybody's stuff? How could you forget when you have a beautiful painting hanging in your school's main hallway? We'll make sure that the kids never forget how the positive Hip-Hop made them feel. If we can get the entire school talking about positive Hip-Hop the kids will begin holding each other accountable!The ImpactI've come to realize that most people think that change won't happen unless it's something that BILLIONS of people join together to do... That is NOT true for popular culture. With popular culture, the most dynamic changes start with just ONE person doing something small yet noticeable. Everybody has influences, everybody has somebody they looked up to. Right now the youth want to be like the rappers they see on mainstream TV/radio... But there aren't any positive rappers in that mainstream arena. Nobody positive is creating what they seek while retaining a constructive perspective. WHEN this tour succeeds we will set a new example, and even if just ONE child decides to start being positive as a result, the cycle will begin to break. This list of organizations I've worked with grows constantly, and I strive to leave an open line of communication with the youth I meet via social networks. I've realized the kids only emulate what works. They need a reason to be positive. If they have someone who's not ""cool"" and or not ""successful"" telling them that they should be positive, they will turn away. They need someone who will show them the benefits of a positive outlook. When people have a positive outlook, they're more receptive to instruction, easier to connect with and more likely to be patient enough to process new information. Using positive Hip-Hop, we can bridge the gap between teachers and students, parents and children, the future leaders and the current leaders. I'm already doing it. Let's take it nationwide! Going Against the GrainHistory has always (in its own strange way) rewarded those who travel off the beaten path. My story has been no different.  I may not be world famous or have my music spinning on the radio daily... but when I show up at the schools, and those kids smile... When I hear them cheer, when they unite and clap in unison... When teachers have to drag them out of the presentation room because they refuse to leave before they get the autograph or picture that they've waited so diligently for... That's when I remember it's worth it. That's when I know it's working. The best part about my plan is that I've already done all the leg work. If you Google me, plenty material will pop up. I've worked with INCREDIBLE musicians and artists - some known nationally, others known internationally, some approaching global status. No matter the song subject, no matter who I collaborate with, my contribution will always contain substance and remain curse-free, setting an example for my young fans!The only risk I face with this plan is the possibility that the news of the campaign may not spread to the public. I admit, problems arise whenever I discuss expanding the movement, simply because people don't see the TRUE value in positive Hip-Hop. People are reluctant to help because they don't understand how Youth Popular Culture affects them. People don't take the movement seriously until they witness it first-hand. Teachers, parents, even government officials are often skeptical because this method is foreign to them... they've forgotten that in the beginning, somebody was able to bond with them through something that they were interested in at the time. They underestimate the power and reach Hip-Hop has... a culture that started in the slums of New York City which has now has spawned B-Boys, Emcees and DJ's worldwide recreating what happened when it all started.Ironically, I get around these obstacles by doing more and more youth work. I overcome these challenges by making more songs and attending more community events. I make connections constantly, and doors open. I'm incredibly diligent. It will work.Tell a FriendEveryone assumes that they need some sort of extravagant or elaborate plan when it comes to spreading the word. We're all guilty of it... Start with your CLOSE FRIENDS and FAMILY. Even if you grandmother, aunt or uncle can't support, they just might tell somebody else who will. Have you ever noticed how when you're telling a close friend about something you're passionate about, you never have to ""think"" about the method of explaining it? Sometimes it just comes out as a jumbled pile of words mixed with smiles and laughter... THAT is more convincing than a 60-second spiel will ever be when talking to close friends and family... because your friends know that if it's something that YOU'RE passionate about, then maybe THEY should be excited about it, too. Good energy is contagious. My music is changing the lives of people who hear it everywhere. Be encouraged!Share this campaign via email. Talk about this movement at work. Post this on facebook. Tweet the progress on twitter! Tell anybody you know who has kids, tell their teachers, tell your mentors, role models and advisers... The world needs to know. Be sure to use the IndieGoGo share tools!THANK YOU ALL SO VERY MUCH. We're changing the world. LITTLE, By little.",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a="""">For those that don’t know me, my name is Christina.  Launch day – September 10 – is my 29th birthday.  All I would like for my
birthday is to be able to put myself one step closer toward a long-time dream
of mine: becoming a nutritionist and wellbeing coach. So, here's my story:

<p><br/>I've always loved to help people in general – however I
could. Yet I never considered nutrition when I was younger.  I educated myself as much as possible on
herbs and essential oils.  This came from
my own problems with pharmaceutical drugs growing up. I thought I was fairly
healthy – I mean I was ‘skinny’ minus some typical woman fluff on my legs.  But then I started going to the gym when I
was about 22-23 years old. I really started to get a taste of the healthy
lifestyle and learned more and more about it. 
Over the next 7 years, I learned much more. In learning and trying
different theories and thoughts, I've experimented with supplements, like
Herbalife, been a gym rat, and came full circle to just training regularly
(basic HIIT and calisthenics) with occasional gym time, and clean eating. </p>
<p>Through all of my self-teaching, I've gained the trust of
many friends and family members, each coming to me with their story and hoping
maybe I would have some information and suggestions to help them with their
health goals.  It’s not all weight
and fitness.  Among my friends and family
I’m known for being fairly positive and maintaining a clear, level-head even in
my worst of times.  All of them have
suggested I find some program or course for becoming a life coach or similar.
Then one day, a few months back a friend sent me a link to a course – he didn't
know I was looking even, simply said ‘I think this is something you’d be
interested in.’ And boy was he right! </p>
<p>Took me a little time to slow down and really look through
the website, but once I did I requested information instantly.  I received the information, even attended a
little online seminar to gather more information – this was it!  Talked to my family and they all agreed that
this was just what I needed.  Then I got
the price. Ouch.  I mean, it’s a great
price for what’s offered, but totally not in my realm of living right now.  But I didn't want to take no as an answer, so
I started brainstorming.  That’s
where we are today. </p>
<p>This campaign is my attempt to raise most of the funds
needed for tuition. But it’s not just about the course, it’s about having the
means to serve my community and help as many in the world to live a healthy
lifestyle that fits them – not a one-size-fits-all concept so many try and become
disappointed with. All I’ve ever wanted to do was help and this allows me the
avenue to do just that. </p>
<p>With your contributions, and my ability to start and finish
this 12 month course, you’re not only helping me achieve a personal dream, but
to give the means to comfortably and confidently reach out to help others with
a proper education and to support my ambition and drive that are hard to extinguish.
Know that your contributions will not only affect my life directly but also
indirectly affect hundreds, hopefully thousands.  I thank you in advance for your time and
consideration ofmy cause. I’m forever grateful from the bottom of my heart. </p>
<h3>What I need and what YOU get out of this</h3>
<p>Everyone loves to give – especially me.  Considering you’re giving to me, I’d love
to give to you more than I can express. While I don’t have a ton of things to
offer as a sincere thank you, I can and will offer various discounts on wellness programs and consultations once I complete the 6-month training course and receive my certification.  (Through the 12 month program, I will receive a pre-certification at 6 months so I'm able to work – kind of like clinicals to a med student.)  Also, I will
send personally handwritten thank-you notes on beautiful postcards from
Croatia, where I currently live. </p>
<p>I’ve set the goal here at $5,500USD.  My tuition is just a little over $6,000,
actually, but it includes everything from fees, books, an iPad mini to help with my school work, access to mobile applications to help stay on top of
assignments, and many beautiful perks like having all the documentation needed to get business going, a fully built website, and a few others.  It’s an incredible situation.  I’m not asking for all of it because I
just need most of it to get me started.  If I can reach the $5,500 goal, that’s
obviously a bulk of the tuition, and the rest I’ll cover through payments.  Even if the full $5,500 isn’t reached,
whatever is will go towards my tuition, so I may complete my first step towards
my goal of helping people.</p>
<p>At the 6-month mark, I’ll be able to give you your perks
that involve discounts on programs and consultations.  Posts cards will arrive in
November after the campaign is over.  </p>
<h3>Changing the World one person at a time</h3>
<p>To elaborate a bit, your contribution is
not just putting me through school.  Rather, you’re helping me live a dream of giving
to and serving the world around us.  If there’s one thing I’ve learned about myself
these last few years, it’s that this is my calling.  Not only do I see myself in
the role of a helper/caretaker, but so do many others that know me.  They have encouraged me to take such a route
before I even gave it serious thought.  The
lack of a healthy lifestyle affects so many millions today all around the
world.  Societies worldwide need real
guidance of how to better balance life so that we can enjoy the gift of living,
not just drag our feet from one point to another in life, loathing it all and
being miserable.  No matter what our
backgrounds or current lifestyles, we all deserve to be happy.  My dream is to help people find their ""Happy,"" and your contributions will help me do that. </p>
<p>I’ve already managed to help a handful of people with no means
to truly serve them outside of personal experience and Google. I look forward
to the thousands more I can help upon completion of the course with your help. </p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Some might be asking, ‘How do you plan to do all this?’ Or
maybe even something along the lines of ‘How are you so sure you’ll
finish?’  If there’s one thing I can say
about myself, it is that I don’t quit if I want it. 
And I want it.  Yes, I work. But my type of work has a very flexible
schedule and my days are not 8-hour days. I will always have time -- or make time -- for my
assignments.  About 5 years ago, I was working
one 9-to-5 style job, and then a bar job Wednesday through Sunday at night,
working on my bachelors online, and going through an online certification
course to teach English as a foreign language. 
I did it all; I passed all tests and all assignments were above the
standards.  My work never lacked either. 
It’s just who I am.  So do not
fear that money will be wasted or that I’ll flunk out because my lifestyle is too
busy or crazy.  This course will be completed. </p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

I know
not everyone can help financially. 
However, any noise you can make helps more than you realize.  There is a Facebook page you can follow.  There is Twitter.  I have a blog I’ve always used as a
platform to discuss healthy lifestyles that is also the launching point
for Mission Nutrition.  Sharing any of
these formats with your friends and families is greatly appreciated.  Links are below.<div><br/></div><div>Again, thank you from the bottom of my heart.</div></div>","For those that don’t know me, my name is Christina.  Launch day – September 10 – is my 29th birthday.  All I would like for my

Over the next 7 years, I learned much more. In learning and trying
different theories and thoughts, I've experimented with supplements, like
Herbalife, been a gym rat, and came full circle to just training regularly
(basic HIIT and calisthenics) with occasional gym time, and clean eating. 
Through all of my self-teaching, I've gained the trust of
many friends and family members, each coming to me with their story and hoping
maybe I would have some information and suggestions to help them with their
health goals.  It’s not all weight
and fitness.  Among my friends and family
I’m known for being fairly positive and maintaining a clear, level-head even in
my worst of times.  All of them have
suggested I find some program or course for becoming a life coach or similar.
Then one day, a few months back a friend sent me a link to a course – he didn't
know I was looking even, simply said ‘I think this is something you’d be
interested in.’ And boy was he right! 
Took me a little time to slow down and really look through
the website, but once I did I requested information instantly.  I received the information, even attended a
little online seminar to gather more information – this was it!  Talked to my family and they all agreed that
this was just what I needed.  Then I got
the price. Ouch.  I mean, it’s a great
price for what’s offered, but totally not in my realm of living right now.  But I didn't want to take no as an answer, so
I started brainstorming.  That’s
where we are today. 
This campaign is my attempt to raise most of the funds
needed for tuition. But it’s not just about the course, it’s about having the
means to serve my community and help as many in the world to live a healthy
lifestyle that fits them – not a one-size-fits-all concept so many try and become
disappointed with. All I’ve ever wanted to do was help and this allows me the
avenue to do just that. 
With your contributions, and my ability to start and finish
this 12 month course, you’re not only helping me achieve a personal dream, but
to give the means to comfortably and confidently reach out to help others with
a proper education and to support my ambition and drive that are hard to extinguish.
Know that your contributions will not only affect my life directly but also
indirectly affect hundreds, hopefully thousands.  I thank you in advance for your time and
consideration ofmy cause. I’m forever grateful from the bottom of my heart. 
What I need and what YOU get out of this
Everyone loves to give – especially me.  Considering you’re giving to me, I’d love
to give to you more than I can express. While I don’t have a ton of things to
offer as a sincere thank you, I can and will offer various discounts on wellness programs and consultations once I complete the 6-month training course and receive my certification.  (Through the 12 month program, I will receive a pre-certification at 6 months so I'm able to work – kind of like clinicals to a med student.)  Also, I will
send personally handwritten thank-you notes on beautiful postcards from
Croatia, where I currently live. 
I’ve set the goal here at $5,500USD.  My tuition is just a little over $6,000,
actually, but it includes everything from fees, books, an iPad mini to help with my school work, access to mobile applications to help stay on top of
assignments, and many beautiful perks like having all the documentation needed to get business going, a fully built website, and a few others.  It’s an incredible situation.  I’m not asking for all of it because I
just need most of it to get me started.  If I can reach the $5,500 goal, that’s
obviously a bulk of the tuition, and the rest I’ll cover through payments.  Even if the full $5,500 isn’t reached,
whatever is will go towards my tuition, so I may complete my first step towards
my goal of helping people.
At the 6-month mark, I’ll be able to give you your perks
that involve discounts on programs and consultations.  Posts cards will arrive in
November after the campaign is over.  
Changing the World one person at a time
To elaborate a bit, your contribution is
not just putting me through school.  Rather, you’re helping me live a dream of giving
to and serving the world around us.  If there’s one thing I’ve learned about myself
these last few years, it’s that this is my calling.  Not only do I see myself in
the role of a helper/caretaker, but so do many others that know me.  They have encouraged me to take such a route
before I even gave it serious thought.  The
lack of a healthy lifestyle affects so many millions today all around the
world.  Societies worldwide need real
guidance of how to better balance life so that we can enjoy the gift of living,
not just drag our feet from one point to another in life, loathing it all and
being miserable.  No matter what our
backgrounds or current lifestyles, we all deserve to be happy.  My dream is to help people find their ""Happy,"" and your contributions will help me do that. 
I’ve already managed to help a handful of people with no means
to truly serve them outside of personal experience and Google. I look forward
to the thousands more I can help upon completion of the course with your help. 
Risks & Challenges
Some might be asking, ‘How do you plan to do all this?’ Or
maybe even something along the lines of ‘How are you so sure you’ll
finish?’  If there’s one thing I can say
about myself, it is that I don’t quit if I want it. 
And I want it.  Yes, I work. But my type of work has a very flexible
schedule and my days are not 8-hour days. I will always have time -- or make time -- for my
assignments.  About 5 years ago, I was working
one 9-to-5 style job, and then a bar job Wednesday through Sunday at night,
working on my bachelors online, and going through an online certification
course to teach English as a foreign language. 
I did it all; I passed all tests and all assignments were above the
standards.  My work never lacked either. 
It’s just who I am.  So do not
fear that money will be wasted or that I’ll flunk out because my lifestyle is too
busy or crazy.  This course will be completed. 
Other Ways You Can Help

I know
not everyone can help financially. 
However, any noise you can make helps more than you realize.  There is a Facebook page you can follow.  There is Twitter.  I have a blog I’ve always used as a
platform to discuss healthy lifestyles that is also the launching point
for Mission Nutrition.  Sharing any of
these formats with your friends and families is greatly appreciated.  Links are below.Again, thank you from the bottom of my heart.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

</p><h3>One of the projects:</h3><p>Lapchi Snow Mountain is situated in the eastern part of
Nepal on the border with Tibet, at a height of about 4850 meters. It is
considered to be a very holy place that has been blessed by the presence of
siddhas and masters like Mahasiddha Saraha, Padmasambhava and Milarepa who
meditated in the caves of Lapchi. Lapchi is closely bound up with the history
of the Drikung Kagyu. Kyobpa Jigten Sumgön had sent countless Vajrayana
practitioners there and in the centuries that followed many outstanding masters
from the Drikung lineage went to Lapchi to advance their practice. Many
practitioners went on extended meditation retreats in one of the numerous
sacred caves. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431408907/nqgwq7d1lzmdiwvnhghn.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
Main
road that connects Lapchi to Nepal destroyed.<div>
<br/>
<p>We have been notified by members of Lapchi association that
almost all of the homes in Lapchi have been destroyed along with roads,
bridges, monastery and retreat homes. A few of the people have also been
injured and they were brought down to Kathmandu to be admitted in the hospital.
</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431409094/ww9a6jhml2sfz2fzrfwi.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
Since
the roads were in bad condition, this photo was taken from helicopter showing
homes destroyed.</div><div>
<br/><p>The people residing in Lapchi are poor and live in simple
homes made of stones and metal roofs. They lack the abundance of basic
utilities like electricity, heat, hot water and gas for cooking that we take so
for granted. With the recent earthquake the situation has only gotten worse. The
simple homes that they lived in have been destroyed and they have been left
homeless. Currently they are living in self-made shelters in nearby caves. Many
have lost all animal live stocks like yak and cows that they greatly depend on.
</p>
<p>Due to the recent rain and the roads being completely
destroyed, the much needed aid has not reached them from the nearby cities.
Somehow till now the villagers have managed to survive due to the fact they are

</div></div>","Our Story
 In response to the current crisisin Nepal, International Drikung Kagyu Council (IDKC) in Nepal have set up a team called ""IDKC Nepal Earthquake Reconstruction Committee"", comprising 11 representatives, who are monks and lay devotees. We are Drikung Kagyu devotees in Beijing, China. Due to the communication barriers in Kathmandu, we decided to help raising funds and updating the info. 
All
the donations will be sent to  ""IDKC Nepal Earthquake Reconstruction Committee"" bank account.In the aftermath of the massive earthquake that struck Nepal on 25 April, Their society members, while being enmeshed in the struggle for survival themselves, are helping others to overcome the predicament they are in, and at the same time, trying to grasp the scale of the damage. There are currently several areas that are in urgent need of relief funds.The monks from Rinchen ling  Monastery sent food to victims.To help the victims in Mamdi village.They are followers of Tibetan Buddhism, who have for generations called Nepal their home. They know their people and their way of life. As a Buddhist group, they actively manifest their compassion and sense of unity in helping one another.A List of Work-in-Progress:1) Emergency provision of relief items like tents, tarpaulin, basic food stuffs, medicine, clothing, sleepingbags etc, to the earthquake victims, who live in the vicinity of the Nepal branch members’ community as well as those in remote areas.2) Counseling for those affected by the earthquake.3) Providing assistance to orphanages and those elderly who live by themselves.4) Renting of helicopters for the delivery of disaster relief items to those victims living in Lapchi mountains and Chosam area, which are now inaccessible by land due to road damage and the collapse of bridges, and also for assessing the condition in those areas in order to evacuate the injured to the hospitals in Kathmandu.5) As some areas are experiencing internet and mobile communication ‘cut off’, we are now helping those foreigners who have gone on a pilgrimage tour to Lapchi by contacting their family members overseas and updating them on the situation.To make a rescue plan in midnight.To deliver the relief supplies to remote villages.List of requirements  -Short term needs:Tarpaulin, tents, sleeping bags, blankets, clothing, medical supply, rental of trucks, cars and helicopters.Volunteers and doctors needed.Medium and long term needs :Generators, solar panels, walkietalkie, satellite phones, reconstruction of bridges, roads and houses.To provide medicines to the victims.To guide experts inspect building damages.
One of the projects:Lapchi Snow Mountain is situated in the eastern part of
Nepal on the border with Tibet, at a height of about 4850 meters. It is
considered to be a very holy place that has been blessed by the presence of
siddhas and masters like Mahasiddha Saraha, Padmasambhava and Milarepa who
meditated in the caves of Lapchi. Lapchi is closely bound up with the history
of the Drikung Kagyu. Kyobpa Jigten Sumgön had sent countless Vajrayana
practitioners there and in the centuries that followed many outstanding masters
from the Drikung lineage went to Lapchi to advance their practice. Many
practitioners went on extended meditation retreats in one of the numerous
sacred caves. 
Main
road that connects Lapchi to Nepal destroyed.

We have been notified by members of Lapchi association that
almost all of the homes in Lapchi have been destroyed along with roads,
bridges, monastery and retreat homes. A few of the people have also been
injured and they were brought down to Kathmandu to be admitted in the hospital.



Since
the roads were in bad condition, this photo was taken from helicopter showing
homes destroyed.
The people residing in Lapchi are poor and live in simple
homes made of stones and metal roofs. They lack the abundance of basic
utilities like electricity, heat, hot water and gas for cooking that we take so
for granted. With the recent earthquake the situation has only gotten worse. The
simple homes that they lived in have been destroyed and they have been left
homeless. Currently they are living in self-made shelters in nearby caves. Many
have lost all animal live stocks like yak and cows that they greatly depend on.

Due to the recent rain and the roads being completely
destroyed, the much needed aid has not reached them from the nearby cities.
Somehow till now the villagers have managed to survive due to the fact they are
used to living simple lives. But they are concerned about the future weather in
the next few months starting August, when it will start to snow in Lapchi. They
need to have their homes repaired before that.

<b>THE PHILOSOPHER, THE MAGICIAN AND THE TRICKSTER</b></p><p><b>A holistic way or perceiving and acting in the world</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>We are four Schumacher College
alumni taking our learnings from Holistic Science and Economics for
Transition on a journey of sharing around Europe, May and June 2015. Our gift
is a series of experiential and co-creative workshops, offered with an open
heart and in service of sustainable living. Keeping at the core of our tour the
spirit of a pilgrim, the project will be funded through gift economy, inviting
individuals to contribute to the journey in whatever way they feel able and
moved to.</p>
<p>Inspired by the archetypal qualities of
the Trickster, the Philosopher and the Magician, we bring play, reflection and
transformation in a workshop format where participants are invited into a
learning community that shares the responsibility for sense-making.</p>
<p>Our intention is to connect
people and places working for a better world, in unique ways: an educational
centre in Austria (The Centre for Global Change and Sustainability), social activism hubs in Spain, a mindfulness community in France and permaculture
centers in Portugal are currently on our route. The offering is a
combination of whole person, experience-led thinking and seriously fun play - an
expanded vision of education. We will invite people on a journey that starts with perceiving the world anew and our relationships within it
more freely, and leads to joyful action for change.</p>
<p>We will explore with participants
topics such as the nature of perception (through a phenomenological approach),
moving towards a living kind of thinking (with Goethean Science), our
relationship with our ecological selves (with Deep Ecology and Gaia Theory),
the complexity of connections as part of living ecosystems (with chaos &amp;
complexity theory), as well as practices of collaborative and common based economy and practical examples of community change from
across the world as an inspiration to co-create the human living systems we
desire. </p>
<p>To reach beyond physical presence at the workshops, we will share
our journey through a blog where we celebrate moments, tell stories of the
places and people we meet and reflect on the experience of learning with a
diversity of humans in different contexts. We will also share the tools—processes,
methodologies, games—that we discover or co-create through our work in an e-book that will be available online, for free to everyone.</p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span></p>To get to all the places we want to visit and to support ourselves, we need around £6000 (50% for transport, 40% for food and 10% for materials). We are crowdfunding for 2/3 of what we need.<div>

<p>The “Young Professionals Mentoring Program (YPMP)” is a non-profit youth mentoring organization dedicated to building lasting relationships between young professionals “mentors” and high school students “mentees”. Our goal is to enhance social development, provide positive role models, and give students a caring and supportive outlet. We believe that, through mentoring, we can help our student mentees set and reach their academic and personal goals. By contributing to our campaign you can provide highly-motivated, goal-oriented high school students with life-long mentors.<br/></p>
<br/> </div> <div> <h3>What Do We Need?</h3>
<ul> </ul>
<div>Our aim is to raise $8,000. All proceeds go directly to fund our events and the administrative costs associated with the program. <i><b>This sole campaign will fund all of our events for the upcoming year.</b></i> Additionally, we are a registered 501(c)(3) organization, so your donation is tax deductible. <p></p>
<div>All donations are welcome. However, there are perks for donations over certain amounts, which are noted to the right. </div>
<div>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul> </ul>
<div>
<p>YPMP partners with The High School of Economics and Finance (HSEF), a public high school with approximately 750 students from all five boroughs of New York City. HSEF is located in lower Manhattan at <a rel=""noopener nofollow"">100 Trinity Place</a>. We are currently mentoring 58 students and are extremely proud to be working with such an impressive group of young people.</p>
<p>All YPMP mentors are trained by the New York City Board of Education and meet with their respective mentees at least once per month at YPMP organized events.</p>
<p>Having a positive role model is extremely valuable to high school students as they are deciding on important life choices such as choosing a college, a major, and ultimately a career path. Since most mentors are at an early stage in their careers, they can provide relevant advice on these decisions based on their experiences. Additionally, having exposure to the wider group of mentors gives  these students access to an excellent network of professionals to help them find internships and jobs once they graduate. <br/></p>
YPMP has sponsored and led a number of group activities for our mentors and mentees. During the course of the academic year we organize monthly group events. The goal of these activities is to introduce our mentees to the many cultural and educational opportunities that New York City has to offer, by experiencing them together, and to build a lasting friendship and bond between mentor and mentee.

<br/><div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
</div>
<p>Just because you can't contribute money, doesn't mean you can't help! There are other ways to help the cause:</p>
<p><b>1) Join the cause - </b>Join YPMP as a mentor (We are especially interested in mentors that want to take a leadership role within the program).</p>
<p><b>2) Internships -</b> We are always looking for internships for our mentees in business, finance and accounting related fields. If you are looking for young, motivated students eager to enter the workforce and make an impact, reach out to us.</p>

   What Do We Need?
 
Our aim is to raise $8,000. All proceeds go directly to fund our events and the administrative costs associated with the program. This sole campaign will fund all of our events for the upcoming year. Additionally, we are a registered 501(c)(3) organization, so your donation is tax deductible. 
All donations are welcome. However, there are perks for donations over certain amounts, which are noted to the right. 



Anyone who donates over $25 will receive a bracelet for reduced drink prices at our celebratory happy hour on June 18th.
Finally, the mentor that raises the most money this year will win a prize for him/herself and his/her mentee. 



The Impact
 

YPMP partners with The High School of Economics and Finance (HSEF), a public high school with approximately 750 students from all five boroughs of New York City. HSEF is located in lower Manhattan at 100 Trinity Place. We are currently mentoring 58 students and are extremely proud to be working with such an impressive group of young people.
All YPMP mentors are trained by the New York City Board of Education and meet with their respective mentees at least once per month at YPMP organized events.
Having a positive role model is extremely valuable to high school students as they are deciding on important life choices such as choosing a college, a major, and ultimately a career path. Since most mentors are at an early stage in their careers, they can provide relevant advice on these decisions based on their experiences. Additionally, having exposure to the wider group of mentors gives  these students access to an excellent network of professionals to help them find internships and jobs once they graduate. 
YPMP has sponsored and led a number of group activities for our mentors and mentees. During the course of the academic year we organize monthly group events. The goal of these activities is to introduce our mentees to the many cultural and educational opportunities that New York City has to offer, by experiencing them together, and to build a lasting friendship and bond between mentor and mentee.


 Other Ways You Can Help

Just because you can't contribute money, doesn't mean you can't help! There are other ways to help the cause:
1) Join the cause - Join YPMP as a mentor (We are especially interested in mentors that want to take a leadership role within the program).
2) Internships - We are always looking for internships for our mentees in business, finance and accounting related fields. If you are looking for young, motivated students eager to enter the workforce and make an impact, reach out to us.
3) Information sessions - Our mentees love to learn about all types of businesses. If you are interested in hosting our group for an event, please let us know.
4) Spread the word - Help us by sharing this campaign with family and friends.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Having only learned how to hoop last year (at age 53), I have found the benefits include weight loss, lessens depression, helps stop/reverse arthritis and osteoporosis and I am hoping to share this amazing tool with the world. My goal is to donate hoops to schools, senior centers and homeless shelters to encourage everyone to have fun getting fit.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For my first goal, I would like to donate 30 adult sized hoops to Amelia Earhart Continuation School in North Hollywood. This school allows at-risk teens to complete their education and get their diploma, even if they have not had the best track record in school. There is no budget for actual P.E. classes so the teachers do their best to include some type of fitness activity during the day. With the budget cuts at all LAUSD schools there is no money for equipment so we would greatly appreciate your donations.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Many of these teens have no outlet for physical fitness activities and would greatly benefit from learning the varied moves of Hoop Dancing. This awesome ""new"" fitness craze utilizes music to get people moving and dancing, while working the core and strengthening the back muscles. Hooping can be a low impact cardio, burning 300 calories an hour or it can be worked up into a great aerobic exercise to burn up to 600 calories per hour. There's no actual skill or rules so anyone can hoop and have fun getting fit.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Please help fight the obesity epidemic in our country by helping me teach young people to find this fun exercise!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I am asking for $900, which will cover the time and materials for making 30 adult assorted sized hoops. If I don't receive all of the $900 I will make as many hoops as the funds will cover. If, for any reason, I receive more than the amount asked for I will apply it to my next project which is donating hoops to the kids of L.A. Family Housing; a transitional shelter where I will be volunteering every week to teach the kids hooping. That's also my next IndieGoGo pitch ;)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Unfortunately, I don't have any perks to offer at this time... if you're in L.A. you could come to any of my hoop groups for free!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>I would appreciate if you told anyone that you think would be interested about this project.</h3>
<h3>Hoopers - I need you too! Want to donate some time? There are hundreds of schools/shelters that could use you!</h3>

<p>My name is Devon, and I'm a volunteer for a small non-profit organization called Koga International Development Association. Koga began in January 2011 as a small project that aimed to teach life skills to children in disadvantaged areas through swimming. Koga means to swim in Kinywarwanda, the local language of Rwanda which is the location of the first swimming project set to start August 2012.</p>
<p>The Swimming Project will take place in Kigali, the capital city of Rwanda. There are numerous hotel pools in Kigali, and the city is only a few hour's drive from both lake Muhazi and lake Kivu. There is very little access to swimming and water safety instruction in Rwanda which limits children of the region from gaining experience in and around water, a major source of work in the lake regions. Lake Kivu is one of Rwanda's largest import and export stations. By providing children with water safety knowledge and swimming skills they will gain greater opportunities for employment in the fishing industry, with boats, and even at hotel swimming pools.</p>
<p>There are four of us going over to Rwanda to teach swimming and water safety. We are all certified swim instructors and lifeguards with backgrounds in competitive swimming.</p>
<p>The organization's founder is over in Rwanda already teaching teachers to teach swimming. They will be shadowing us as we teach boys from a local orphanage between the ages of 4-22 for three weeks. We will continue to fund the project for at least 5 more years. We want our project to be as sustainable as possible and will make sure that the teachers have the resources they need to continue it!</p>
<p>By contributing to this campaign, you can help prevent drownings and help increase the opportunities for young people in Rwanda to gain employment in water-related fields.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>The money we raise through this campaign is going directly to the project, all four volunteers are paying their own way over to Rwanda.</p>
<p>Here are our expenses:</p>
<p>$1300 = pool rental</p>
<p>$1700 = bus rental to transport the children</p>
<p>$1310 = accommodation for volunteers for 3 weeks</p>
<p>$1200 = food for volunteers for 3 weeks</p>
<p>$200 = translator</p>
<p>Total needed for project: $5710.</p>
<p>What we've raised so far: $1518</p>
<p>What we still need to raise: $4192.</p>
<p>To be realistic, I've only made our goal on this campaign $2,500 and will be holding other fundraising events in Vancouver, BC to raise the rest.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>The Perks!</em></p>
<p>Besides feeling like an awesome human being for helping out with the project, you get some perks in appreciation for your help!</p>
<p>If you donate $25: you get a picture of a child who learned to swim with your help with a letter of appreciation.</p>
<p>If you donate $100: you get the previous perk, PLUS some traditional Rwandan embroidery. You will also be listed on our website as one of our donors!</p>
<p>If you donate $200: you get both the previous perks, plus a beautiful traditional woodwork art piece from Rwanda.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>By donating to this campaign, not only are you directly funding the Swimming Project, but you are also encouraging a very small non-profit to continue doing projects around the world in the future. This is our first one, and we are extremely excited to begin building up a foundation of knowledge and volunteers in order to improve on our projects in the future. </p>

<p align=""center""><em> </em></p>
<p>My name is Maria Almanza. I am a New Yorker, who is currently pursuing her education in nursing. I was visiting Nepal this summer for an independent study and to gain more hands on clinical practice. Originally my plan was to volunteer as a nurse at the hospital, College of Medical Sciences ,in Chitwan, Nepal... and come back home. </p>
<p>   However, it turned into something much more than what I had expected. While I was doing my rounds, I noticed there were an immense amount of patients who needed hemodialysis due to kidney failure and also patients who had a plethora of cardiac diseases, and the reason being is DIABETES. Many of these medical problems could have been prevented by early diagnosis and health education. Unfourtunately, the people of Nepal can not afford reguar health exams, and therefore, many are living with DIABETES AND THEY DO NOT EVEN KNOW... UNTIL IT IS TOO LATE. </p>
<p>    These patients do not have medical insurance in order to receive any type of health care. Patients literally have to sell their homes and all of their belongings just to get hemodialysis, treatment, which cost about 3,500 Rupees/week  ($43.00US). That does not include the cost of hospital stay, medication, lab work, food ,and other  needed resources  Patients need to pay for everything out of their pocket!  When I learned this, I knew I wanted to help. I set up a meeting with the Director of College of Medical Sciences, and told him about my desire to help. He informed me that chronic diseases are drastically rising in Nepal, and the government does not provide any help for the people.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>   With good fortune and help from the hospital I was volunteering at, I started a local Non Profit Organization in Nepal; College of Medical Sciences Diabetic Foundation. There is a committee of doctors and nurses and well renowned community leaders, who are willing to volunteer their time and take me to the villages of Chitwan.  The goal is to provide free health care which includes: diabetic testing, administering medication, and educating  the local people about  nutrition and health issues. Many people live hours away from any hospital or health post, with no access to any form of transportation.  If patients need to go to a hospital or doctor, transportation will be provided by the foundation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>College of Medical Sciences Diabetic Foundation will make an IMMENSE impact on the lives of the people of Nepal and can change the future of Nepal’s healthcare system. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>How can you help? Donate! You can contact me directly through email with any questions you may have. There is no “middle man” here. All donations will go through me. I am returning back to Nepal in February to start my work. I will be in direct contact with the patients, doctors, nurses, pharmacists and medical suppliers. Your money will be directly forwarded to the sustainability of the foundation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Here is a brief breakdown of where the funds will be going:</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>$10.00 will provide $70.00 worth of medical supplies such as wound dressing, linens and educational material</p>
<p>$25.00 will provide $175.00 worth of medical equipment such as stethoscopes and blood pressure machines.</p>
<p>$25.00 will provide insulin for 50 patients</p>
<p>$50.00 will purchase an exam bed</p>
<p>$75.00 will purchase a hospital bed</p>
<p>$100.00 will provide an insulin pump for 50 patients</p>
<p>$500.00 will establish a pharmacy</p>
<p>$1,500 will establish a community lab</p>
<p>$3,000 will establish the construction of a local clinic</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you would like to donate supplies rather than money, that is completely POSSIBLE!</p>
<p>If you can not make any kind of donation at the moment, please  spread the word!  </p>
<p>Our future goal is to build a clinic equipped with exam rooms, a pharmacy, a fitness room and a yoga/ meditation center.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>With the help of your donations we can make a huge impact on the needy people of Nepal. Please BE AWARE AND SHARE.</p>

<p> </p></div>","My name is Maria Almanza. I am a New Yorker, who is currently pursuing her education in nursing. I was visiting Nepal this summer for an independent study and to gain more hands on clinical practice. Originally my plan was to volunteer as a nurse at the hospital, College of Medical Sciences ,in Chitwan, Nepal... and come back home. 
   However, it turned into something much more than what I had expected. While I was doing my rounds, I noticed there were an immense amount of patients who needed hemodialysis due to kidney failure and also patients who had a plethora of cardiac diseases, and the reason being is DIABETES. Many of these medical problems could have been prevented by early diagnosis and health education. Unfourtunately, the people of Nepal can not afford reguar health exams, and therefore, many are living with DIABETES AND THEY DO NOT EVEN KNOW... UNTIL IT IS TOO LATE. 
    These patients do not have medical insurance in order to receive any type of health care. Patients literally have to sell their homes and all of their belongings just to get hemodialysis, treatment, which cost about 3,500 Rupees/week  ($43.00US). That does not include the cost of hospital stay, medication, lab work, food ,and other  needed resources  Patients need to pay for everything out of their pocket!  When I learned this, I knew I wanted to help. I set up a meeting with the Director of College of Medical Sciences, and told him about my desire to help. He informed me that chronic diseases are drastically rising in Nepal, and the government does not provide any help for the people.  
 
   With good fortune and help from the hospital I was volunteering at, I started a local Non Profit Organization in Nepal; College of Medical Sciences Diabetic Foundation. There is a committee of doctors and nurses and well renowned community leaders, who are willing to volunteer their time and take me to the villages of Chitwan.  The goal is to provide free health care which includes: diabetic testing, administering medication, and educating  the local people about  nutrition and health issues. Many people live hours away from any hospital or health post, with no access to any form of transportation.  If patients need to go to a hospital or doctor, transportation will be provided by the foundation.
 
College of Medical Sciences Diabetic Foundation will make an IMMENSE impact on the lives of the people of Nepal and can change the future of Nepal’s healthcare system. 
 
 
 
How can you help? Donate! You can contact me directly through email with any questions you may have. There is no “middle man” here. All donations will go through me. I am returning back to Nepal in February to start my work. I will be in direct contact with the patients, doctors, nurses, pharmacists and medical suppliers. Your money will be directly forwarded to the sustainability of the foundation.
 
 
 
Here is a brief breakdown of where the funds will be going:
 
 
$10.00 will provide $70.00 worth of medical supplies such as wound dressing, linens and educational material
$25.00 will provide $175.00 worth of medical equipment such as stethoscopes and blood pressure machines.
$25.00 will provide insulin for 50 patients
$50.00 will purchase an exam bed
$75.00 will purchase a hospital bed
$100.00 will provide an insulin pump for 50 patients
$500.00 will establish a pharmacy
$1,500 will establish a community lab
$3,000 will establish the construction of a local clinic
 
If you would like to donate supplies rather than money, that is completely POSSIBLE!
If you can not make any kind of donation at the moment, please  spread the word!  
Our future goal is to build a clinic equipped with exam rooms, a pharmacy, a fitness room and a yoga/ meditation center.
 
With the help of your donations we can make a huge impact on the needy people of Nepal. Please BE AWARE AND SHARE.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>My Heart:</h3>
<p>I spent last year in Hungary. I've been back in the U.S. for more than 6 months, but I can't stop thinking of two village communities that I fell in love with. I spent every Tuesday and Thursday afternoon attending church services and playing games with the children afterwards. Being able to help provide them with a safe place to play and be a kid brought me so much joy. I truly miss these beautiful people. </p>
<p>One day last year, I had the opportunity to take 4 girls from one of the villages to an adventure park. Although it as a 5 minute walk from their homes, they had never been there before. This was by far my favorite day in Hungary. I had so much fun with these girls. We couldn't communicate that well, but Annita (the youngest of the bunch) kept shouting the lyrics to the Flo Rida song ""Ohh, ohh, sometimes, I get a good feeling!"" Then she'd ask me, ""Good Feeling, Ms. Anna?"" That day she smiled more than I had ever seen before. </p>
<p>These families that I spent time with don't have much (no running water, small and often unsanitary living conditions) but they're gracious, loving, and resilient. I want to give back to them. </p>
<h3> </h3>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need:</h3>
<p>The money will go directly to the missionary family who planted the churches I attended along with 5 other churches. The parents names are Anna and Choi, and they have an 11-year-old daughter named Lidia. All of the funds given to them will be used to help the Roma churches this family cares for.  </p>
<ul>
<li>By raising 500+ we can help a village get running water. <br/><br/>
</li>
<li>Money will be used to sponsor education for children. (Only one in four complete primary school)<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>Money will be used to help feed children and motivate them to stay in school. The missionary family has two places in Romania (a border country) where Roma children can enjoy a free lunch. The only thing the children have to do is prove they attended school that day. The money we raise can help feed daily nutrious meals to these children and keep them in school. </li>
</ul>
<p>-My prayer and dream is to be able to hand deliver the funds we raise and spend a week in Hungary playing sports and organizing fun activities for the kids this summer. This is a last priority though, and something we'd have to go WAY above and beyond to afford, but I'm putting it out there.  </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3><strong>Additional Information:</strong></h3>
<p>This isn't a charity. This is a partnership, and that means we aren't giving and walking away. Anna and Choi (the missionary family) are there every day to guide and support the work that these people are doing. They are helping them find jobs, partnering and teaching these families to grow sweet potatoes and other crops, and helping them become independent. </p>
<p><strong>If you type ""Roma in Hungary"" or ""Gypsies in Hungary"" into google, you'll find countless articles about the struggles this fundraiser is set up to combate. </strong></p>

<p><strong>Here’s what we know</strong>: Theatre enriches children’s lives. When students rehearse, they learn discipline and commitment. When students perform, they gain self-confidence and experience positive recognition, some maybe for the first time. When students watch plays, they understand the power of storytelling and realize that, in the end, what unites us is far greater than what separates us.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what else we know</strong>: In 2012, the Baltimore City Public School System has 14 full-time equivalent theater teachers – one teacher for every 8,000 kids. That equation doesn’t add up. That’s why I founded Baltimore TheatreWorks. I need your help to make a difference in the lives of thousands of children in Baltimore.</p>
<p>Here are some numbers that do add up.</p>
<p><strong>What your support will make possible. </strong></p>
<p><em>Colorism</em> is a play I wrote about how the tone of someone's skin can make a huge difference in their lives. The play features 3 women – one light-skinned, one medium-skinned and one dark-skinned – and explores the cultural issues associated with that. We’ll tour city high schools and engage Baltimore’s best actor/teachers. Our student audiences will talk and write about the issues raised by the production, openly engaged in a way they’ve never been before. Cost: $50,000</p>
<p>The Teen Performance Program will provide area teens the opportunity to work with professional directors and designers, in three annual productions ranging from Shakespeare to August Wilson. As producer, I’ll promote the work of these talented kids throughout the region. Cost: $30,000 (3 plays @$10,000 each)</p>
<p>Baltimore TheatreWorks co-founder Joan Weber will train theatre artists who want to be theatre classroom teachers. Here’s some more bad math: When the school system tries this, the average teacher lasts one month. They don't know how to write lesson plans or manage classrooms, so they have no chance for success. We’ll train, support and place dedicated teaching artists in city schools, and we’ll keep supporting them once they start. Cost: $50,000</p>
<p>Baltimore TheatreWorks artists will direct and produce after-school theater productions in Baltimore City schools for students, family members and the community. There is no better way to bring a parent into the school than to put their kid on stage. Once the parent is in the building, there's no telling what kind of good relationships can be built. Cost: $5,000 per school</p>
<p>Act now so our kids can act now. Please help us make this work a reality. Become a Founding Donor today, or give at whatever level you can. Contact us at with your ideas or questions. Let’s imagine a day when Shakespeare’s famous line “All the world’s a stage” extends to the public schools and communities of Baltimore – changing lives, neighborhoods and ultimately a city.</p></div>","Baltimore TheatreWorks: Kids + Theatre = A Difference

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>Hi, my name is Mashawnda Dowell. I go by Masha. For the past year I have been obsessively going to the Actors Space website at <a href=""http://www.actors-space.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title="""">www.actors-space.org</a>. I would go to the site and just day dream about attending the workshop. Well, I wrote down my vision, and I let it go. Well, last summer when I was let go from my lucrative job as a Quality Manager, I gave some more consideration to this educational opportunity, and then I forgot about it... AGAIN. Well, this past Spring I decided I would like to actually go. So, I signed up for email updates on the site and all, and I attempted to shape my personal finances to allow me to go. Well, as life would have it, my money was not adding up well to go. However, I still kept my dream of attending. Well, two weeks ago, the organization sent out an eblast telling people about their "" Fenix Award"". Its basically an award that goes to the best candidate to assist them with the fees associated with the program. WELL, as it turns out, I nervously submitted an essay for the opportunity and I got the AWARD!  Well. I am deeply grateful for the award, but now I need to raise the rest of the fees within 2 weeks. </p>

<p>I am a professionally trained scientist turned actress. I am from Winston-Salem, NC. My first play was in 7th grade, "" A MidSummer's Night Dream"". I attended Tri-Cities High School's Drama program for a year, and then I went back to regular public high school my 10th grade year. Between 10th grade to my college graduation I did not think of drama again. In 2000, I obtained a BS in Agriculture Science, and for almost a decade, I worked mostly graveyard shift as a scientific researcher, while I found my calling in arts and entertainment. My calling led me to LA to intern at several big name production companies, and to DC to study media studies at Howard University for a year. After DC, I returned to NC, and I decided at 30 years old to go after my dream of acting. In 2008, I was cast in a short play, in 2009, a full length play, and then in 2010 I obtained an agent, and starred in a commercial. In 2011, I have done the most to date: 1 commercial, 2 student films, 1 Indie film, and background work on 1 feature film and 1 TV show. I have a deep interest in world cinema, and I believe that my education at the Actors Space will be a catalyst to get me to my dream of being an international actress.</p>

<p><b>THE EDUCATION</b></p>
<p>The Actors Space is an organization in Vic, Spain that assists actors with their acting education. This can range from various techniques, to acting for the camera, and other helpful work. The thing that I find most attractive about the school is the fact that I, as an American, will get the opportunity to connect with people from all over the world. I will get to be exposed to performers like me, but from other countries --- who take their craft very seriously. In America, I have been professionally trained at the TVI Actors studio in Hollywood in TV Hosting, Scene study with famed acting coach Vera Katz, Scene study with popular actress Tasha Smith, and last but not least, I have been trained in improv at the Raleigh Little Theater. This summer, I want to add that I have been trained internationally at the Actors Space in Spain. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>YOUR HELP</b></p>
<p>Of course I'm going to work my butt off to obtained the funds for the trip myself. I must go! This is a chance of a lifetime, however, I need additional financial help. If I could do it all myself, I'd jump for joy, but I can't. So, I am asking for your help. </p>

In 2000, I obtained a BS in Agriculture Science, and for almost a decade, I worked mostly graveyard shift as a scientific researcher, while I found my calling in arts and entertainment. My calling led me to LA to intern at several big name production companies, and to DC to study media studies at Howard University for a year. After DC, I returned to NC, and I decided at 30 years old to go after my dream of acting. In 2008, I was cast in a short play, in 2009, a full length play, and then in 2010 I obtained an agent, and starred in a commercial. In 2011, I have done the most to date: 1 commercial, 2 student films, 1 Indie film, and background work on 1 feature film and 1 TV show. I have a deep interest in world cinema, and I believe that my education at the Actors Space will be a catalyst to get me to my dream of being an international actress.

My personal website www.mashadowell.com

THE EDUCATION
The Actors Space is an organization in Vic, Spain that assists actors with their acting education. This can range from various techniques, to acting for the camera, and other helpful work. The thing that I find most attractive about the school is the fact that I, as an American, will get the opportunity to connect with people from all over the world. I will get to be exposed to performers like me, but from other countries --- who take their craft very seriously. In America, I have been professionally trained at the TVI Actors studio in Hollywood in TV Hosting, Scene study with famed acting coach Vera Katz, Scene study with popular actress Tasha Smith, and last but not least, I have been trained in improv at the Raleigh Little Theater. This summer, I want to add that I have been trained internationally at the Actors Space in Spain. 

YOUR HELP
Of course I'm going to work my butt off to obtained the funds for the trip myself. I must go! This is a chance of a lifetime, however, I need additional financial help. If I could do it all myself, I'd jump for joy, but I can't. So, I am asking for your help.

<h2><strong>Vision</strong></h2>
<p>In partnership with Peace Conflict and Resolution, a grassroots organization in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), we are creating a community-driven action-plan. Our focus is centered upon trauma counselling training for women and adds capacity building for future projects focused on community wellness, sustainability and self-sufficiency.  It is our belief that we are all whole, capable and resilient people who, with necessary supports, can self-determine the healthy transformation of our communities.  We have been invited to join such work of communities in Bukavu.</p>
<h2><strong>The Impact</strong></h2>
<p>Your support of this self-sustaining training program will help local communities create better lives for the people in Bukavu.  Investing in this type of work gives support directly to the people most impacted by violence and poverty in the DRC. Our work is voluntary so that we can use our resources for implementing grassroots projects on the ground. However, we have to get there first.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Short Summary</strong></h3>
<p>Bukavu city is on the Eastern side of the DRC. The DRC has been under much political turmoil for years because of the resources in the area - gold, diamonds, and coltan are some of these. Because the resources are in such high demand there is no end in sight. For instance, 65% of the world's coltan is supplied by the DRC.  Coltan is used in most electronic devices, cell phones, computers, ink jet printers, camera lenses, etc. </p>
<p>Caught in the dynamics of war between multinational corporations (some of them Candadian companies), rebels and government—all fighting for land resources—the people in Bukavu, and other small villages, are under constant threat of violence, theft, and execution. These clashes directly affect women and children through displacement, rape, hunger and violence and leave them susceptible to forced conscription into rebel armies.</p>
<p>Basic survival needs, security, food and clean water are scarce resources and hard to supply to the many children who are orphaned and left to fend for themselves. </p>
<p>We have seen the devastation of Indigenous communities in our home territories in the North, and feel called to support other communities facing similar or worse conditions in the DRC.</p>

</p><p>Please help me renovate three improvised primary schools around my
village in Sierra Leone, West Africa.  </p>
<p>Education-Alhaji, USA. </p>
<p><b>Short
Summary:  </b></p>
<p>I am trying to renovate three primary schools (Sierra Leone
Wesleyan Primary school, Maforay and SLMB Primary schools) attended by approximately
900 students around my village in Sierra Leone, West Africa. </p>
<p>One of the primary schools is my former school.  As a boy, I attended the SLMB primary school
until my village was destroyed in 1997 during Sierra Leone’s civil war. As a
fifth grader, I was allowed to stay for a semester when my parents could not
afford my $5.00 tuition at the time.</p>
<p>As a former student, I hope I can give these children
opportunities that were never given to me: like a library, a decent classroom
or a computer lab—with your support we can build dreams, with dreams we can
change minds. I hope you can help!</p>
<p><b>Why
Village Primary Schools?</b></p>
<p> I know personally the
difficulties that these children are facing every day.  Most of these children are coming from surrounding
villages and they walk about 2-3 miles to get to school. Education—is their
only hope out of poverty. So they come everyday walking an average of 250 miles
each school year. The roof leaks whenever it rains, flooding the classrooms—disrupting
classes several days a week during the rainy seasoning. Together, we can save
the last hope of my village. We can rebuild these schools; we can build a
better future through education. <span> Many people wait and see if their condition will
improve rather than seek assistance.</span></p>
<p><b>My
History  </b></p>
<p>I was born
and raised in <b>Sierra Leone, West Africa</b> and returned for first visit
since I fled our civil war  as a teenager
about 13 years ago.  l left my home and family, alone, as a boy due to the
terrible conditions there at the time. I finally made it to the Philadelphia,
after years of hardship and duress, and enrolled in public high school as a
junior.  With pretty much 7 years of formal schooling, and purely through
dint of will, intelligence, and incredible drive, l graduated from the bottom
5% of my class. I ultimately moved to a local community college in Texas,
worked my way through before transferring to the University of North Texas, and
funded my entire education without any loans or government assistance. </p>
<p>In 2012, I
was accepted at the University of Pennsylvania and on target to graduate with
an M.A. in Economic Development and Growth next May.  From a child hiding
in a tragic and dangerous civil war to the Ivy League!</p>
<p>Now I am

the children in my village.</p>

Hello, Seekho’s comprehensive curriculum is created by teachers with experience in curriculum development in leading schools in India, and has been vetted by educational consultants. A vast selection of short pre-recorded audio clips is available on our toll free number, and are pre-recorded with professional voice actors and musicians at a local studio.Vaasvi and Kasturi began Hello, Seekho  during their sophomore year at Princeton University after realising that they shared a similar passion for improving access to English education in India. Last November we sat in a froyo cafe in Princeton, past closing hours, and listed all the problems in India that we wanted to solve. We picked education because we both felt it had the most long-lasting impact, and so Hello, Seekho was born.Having both grown up in India, we share a nuanced understanding of the intricacies of the Indian education system. Our native fluency in Hindi, connections with local non-profits, experience teaching and developing curriculum, enthusiasm from the success of our pilot, and finally, our determination to close the education gap in India are the colours with which we plan to paint a brighter future for students in India.This past summer, we launched a pilot in New Delhi using the $5000 seed funding we received from winning a seed funding competition at Princeton. We launched a pilot in August 2014 and have received positive feedback and testimonials from students in the slum colonies where the pilot was launched.Having launched a successful pilot, our next steps are to analyze the data and increase our impact. While we have received thousands of phone calls, the process of streamlining our curriculum to reflect our listener’s preferences is a continuously ongoing one. From December 2014 onwards, we will partner with the Ahvaan Trust, a non-profit that carries out teacher training in government schools, to market our service and conduct workshops within these schools.We still have a long way to go, and many students to reach, but students like Neelam are our founding and continuous inspiration.               If you would like to get involved, please email us with a short statement explaining your interest at kasturi@helloseekho.com and vaasvi@helloseekho.com",9.0,0,"1 Campaign

<div>I wanted to thank you all for taking time to stop by my page. My name is Jennifer Meneray for those that do not know me already and I am passionate about advocating for social justice within our community. To better serve my community, I have started this campaign to help raise the funds needed to get me into a Graduate level program. This includes but is not limited to application fees, transcript fees, as well as the Graduate Record Examination (GRE). Scary Stuff-- I know, but I have been studying, I promise! </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>My goal is to enter a program that analyzes the effect institutional oppression has on cultural values worldwide and how that connects to violence towards different gender identities. I will be applying to programs such as Feminist Studies, Women Studies, Gender Studies, etc. and will be looking for a program that focuses on International politics. The possibility of a joint program in Feminist Studies and International Politics has also crossed my mind, but without your help these possibilities are limited. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>After graduating from my future program I wish to work towards ending violence against women on an international scale either by entering the political arena or working for the United Nations UNiTE to End Violence Against Women Program (<a href=""http://endviolence.un.org/about.shtml)"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://endviolence.un.org/about.shtml)</a>. <br/>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I have been out of school for two years so I am currently paying back student loans from my undergraduate career. This has caused financial strain for me and I do not want it to be the reason I postpone my dreams longer. I appreciate everything you have done for me in the past and you all inspire me to continue to my journey towards my goals. With everyone's help I know that anything is possible and I hope you view any contribution to my campaign as an investment in my future rather than a simple donation. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>For those that wish to contribute but cannot do so financially, simply spreading the word would be enough. If you could let people in your life know how you know me and how I have impacted your life in a positive way then maybe they will see a donation as an investment in something positive. Encouraging emails are also helpful so if you all could help fund my future I would greatly be appreciative. </div>

<p><b>BACKGROUND:</b></p>
<p>Durante il mese di gennaio 2015 la FAI (Federazione Aeronautica Internazionale) ha finalmente definito il volo in tuta alare come un disciplina ufficiale del paracadutismo e ha anche annunciato la prima Coppa del Mondo di Wingsuit, questo ha creato enorme attesa non solo nella comunità Wingsuit, ma anche in tutta l'industria del paracadutismo - un vero grande successo per lo sport, ed un altro distintivo d'onore per gli appassionati di sport estremi.</p>
<p>La Coppa del Mondo sarà ospitata dalla Army Parachute Association a Netheravon, Inghilterra e si svolgerà tra Lunedi 25 e Venerdì 29 maggio.</p>
<p>Per partecipare alla Coppa del Mondo un concorrente deve essere nominato dalla sua autorità nazionale (Coni ed AeroClub d'Italia) quale ""delegazione nazionale"".</p>
<p>AeroClub Italia non può permettersi di pagare per i propri concorrenti in quanto il budget è già stato totalmente stanziato, come accade in molti altri paesi, a fine 2014 (la Coppa del Mondo è stata annunciata a gennaio) e chiede quindi ai singoli atleti interessati a partecipare di pagare in autonomia la propria competizione.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>DI COSA ABBIAMO BISOGNO E COSA OTTERRETE</b></p>
<p>Abbiamo bisogno di soldi, per un duro e serio allenamento... si tratta della prima coppa del mondo e la fuori si gioca duro !</p>

</div></div>","BACKGROUND: During January 2015 FAI (International Aeronautic Federation) have finally defined WingSuit Flying as a regular skydiving discipline and have announced the first Wingsuit World Cup, this has attracted huge anticipation amongst not only the Wingsuiting fraternity, but the skydiving industry as whole – a truly great achievement for the sport, and another badge of honour for extreme sports enthusiasts.The World Cup will be hosted by the Army Parachute Association at Netheravon Airfield, Wiltshire, UK and will take place between Monday 25th and Friday 29th May. In order to partecipate to the World Cup a competitor must be nominated by his national authority as National delegation.Italian skydiving authority (AeCI) cannot afford to pay for its own competitors because, as it happends in many other countries, the budget for international competitions as been decided at the end of 2014 (the World Cup has been announced at January 2015). For this reason AeCI is  asking to competitors who are interested to take part at the World Cup to pay it by themself.
   What We Need & What You Get We need money, for training hard.You get nothing material, except our gratitude.but:If you are a potential sponsor, interested in a sponsorship agreement, please contact me, we have a lot to talk of !

BACKGROUND:
Durante il mese di gennaio 2015 la FAI (Federazione Aeronautica Internazionale) ha finalmente definito il volo in tuta alare come un disciplina ufficiale del paracadutismo e ha anche annunciato la prima Coppa del Mondo di Wingsuit, questo ha creato enorme attesa non solo nella comunità Wingsuit, ma anche in tutta l'industria del paracadutismo - un vero grande successo per lo sport, ed un altro distintivo d'onore per gli appassionati di sport estremi.
La Coppa del Mondo sarà ospitata dalla Army Parachute Association a Netheravon, Inghilterra e si svolgerà tra Lunedi 25 e Venerdì 29 maggio.
Per partecipare alla Coppa del Mondo un concorrente deve essere nominato dalla sua autorità nazionale (Coni ed AeroClub d'Italia) quale ""delegazione nazionale"".
AeroClub Italia non può permettersi di pagare per i propri concorrenti in quanto il budget è già stato totalmente stanziato, come accade in molti altri paesi, a fine 2014 (la Coppa del Mondo è stata annunciata a gennaio) e chiede quindi ai singoli atleti interessati a partecipare di pagare in autonomia la propria competizione.

DI COSA ABBIAMO BISOGNO E COSA OTTERRETE
Abbiamo bisogno di soldi, per un duro e serio allenamento... si tratta della prima coppa del mondo e la fuori si gioca duro !
siamo sinceri: non avrete nulla di materiale, solo la nostra totale e sincera gratitudine.

ma:
Se sei un potenziale sponsor, interessato a sottoscrivere un contratto di sponsorizzazione contattami, abbiamo molto di cui parlare !

Each ambassador of the book, of which I am one, will furthermore help to spread the message, in my case by making a promotional film with insight into some of these girls lives, which will be produced in conjunction with the climb.</p>
<p>Education leads to better opportunities for a decent livelihood and economic independence. It enhances personal confidence and well-being. The more educated we are the less charity we need in our lives.</p>
<p>In Tanzania 400.000 children lack the opportunity to get proper school education. 70% of those are girls and more than 4000 schools have a shortage of study material.<strong><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>THE BOOK ""DREAMERS AND DOERS""</strong></p>
<p>The book “Dreamers and Doers” will be a photographic book featuring a collection of inspirational stories and  life changing moments of women who have been to Kilimanjaro. It is to be published in June 2013. The sale of the book supports Tanzanian children with study material.</p>
<p>Each buyer of “Dreamers and Doers” has the opportunity to track the outcome of their good deed. Relevant information will be published in the book and can also be found on the ladiestrekking website.</p>

<p><strong>SUPPORTING TANZANIAN GIRLS WITH STUDY MATERIAL AND SCHOOL FEES</strong></p>
<p>The journey of the textbooks to the schoolchildren is organised and implemented by the charitable foundation Impatiens Kilimanjari. Their members are international professional women who have teaching experience in Tanzania and are well aware of the country’s educational challenges. The aim is to pin point the recipients who need our support most and to provide them with the textbooks that are compatible with the curriculum taught in Tanzanian schools. </p>
<p>Furthermore 10 girls will be supported financially through their entire school education.</p>

<p><strong>THE TREK</strong></p>
<p>In order to make sure the idea and message of the book reaches the readers, ten women of different nationalities have been invited to be ambassadors of the book and trek to Kilimanjaro in February 2013 and take the message “Everyone is entitled to education” to the summit.

<p>“We could probably save a fortune, both emotionally for kids and their families, as well as taxpayer dollars, if we cloned The DOME.” <br/>— Judge Judith Sheindlin</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The DOME Project, an acronym for Developing Opportunities through Meaningful Education, is a 501c(3) nonprofit organization that was founded in 1973 by John Simon. The DOME Project is committed to improving the lives of young people who rely on the services we provide in the areas of alternative to detention, college preparation, and tutoring. The DOME Project seeks funding to support the expansion and development of our programming in order to support our most important asset: our youth. With an expansion of staff and programs, we anticipate an increase in the number of youth we provide services to and we hope to effectuate a greater impact for the underserved youth in New York City.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>The DOME Project seeks $10,000 in funding to provide continued assistance with our three flagship programs:</p>

The DOME Project, an acronym for Developing Opportunities through Meaningful Education, is a 501c(3) nonprofit organization that was founded in 1973 by John Simon. The DOME Project is committed to improving the lives of young people who rely on the services we provide in the areas of alternative to detention, college preparation, and tutoring. The DOME Project seeks funding to support the expansion and development of our programming in order to support our most important asset: our youth. With an expansion of staff and programs, we anticipate an increase in the number of youth we provide services to and we hope to effectuate a greater impact for the underserved youth in New York City.
 


What We Need
The DOME Project seeks $10,000 in funding to provide continued assistance with our three flagship programs:
 
The Alternative to Detention Program: Bridge to Success is an extraordinarily successful and cost-effective effort that provides young people with counseling, school and court advocacy, life skills development, and guidance toward educational and vocational opportunities to both prevent at-risk youth from further involvement in criminal activity and reduce future involvement in the criminal justice system.
 
The Academic Tutoring Program continues to serve our traditional population of disadvantaged youth with distinct educational needs by pairing youths with a volunteer tutor for supervised subject specific academic sessions. Program participants receive highly individualized educational support from their volunteer tutor often more rigorous and challenging than the work the student receives in school.
 
The College Prep Program successfully assists many students in gaining entry to colleges and prep schools through intensive academic support services.

If you donate, you will get one of the many perks listed on our page!

The Impact
All donations are TAX DEDUCTIBLE.  Your donation will allow us to:
 
Serve a larger number of at risk youth who need assistance with trouble(s) with the law, college preparation, and tutoring/mentoring.
 
Enable our staff members to receive professional development training.
 
Update our website to make it more contemporary and allow us to purcase space to host referral forms for those seeking to put us in contact wih at risk youth.

We do this through <a href=""http://waawfoundation.org/girls-stem-camp.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Girls STEM camps</a> (11 - 15years); <a href=""http://waawfoundation.org/education.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Scholarships and mentoring</a>(College girls); and <a href=""http://waawfoundation.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=101"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">African Women in Technology Conferences</a>(Professional Women).</p>
<h3><strong>Our Vision</strong></h3>
<p>To train and engage African women thought leaders in Science and Technology, who contribute to innovation, economic growth and poverty eradication in Africa.</p>
<h3><strong>To empower African women with a strong voice by building STEM communities that strengthen her impact by:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Exposing, motivating and mentoring girls in their pursuit of rewarding careers in science, engineering and technology related fields</li>
<li>Providing opportunities for education and promoting sustainable technology research and innovation activities for African Women.</li>
<li>Building vibrant communities that engage girls with role models and mentors to ensure an ever increasing pipeline.</li>
<li>Promoting communities that bring African women thought leaders and organizations from private industry, academia and governments to share ideas, collaborate build and retain technology capacity in Africa.</li>
</ul><h3>Our People</h3>
<p>WAAW Foundation is currently run by a group of women who have these in common:</p>
<ul>
<li>A passion for education.</li>
<li>A passion for the advancement of women in STEM fields</li>
</ul><p>All the executives work on a voluntary basis, contributing their time and money to the WAAW cause. They are all either women in STEM fields or women in education who see the shortage of women in STEM fields, the need to empower and encourage girls/women to remain or join in STEM innovations in Africa and who are eager to give back to the continent (Africa) they grew up in.</p>
<h2>What our Scholarship program has achieved so far?</h2>
<p>Since 2008, we have awarded five scholarships to African girls to enable them continue to go to school and get an education.</p>
<ol>
<li>Lillian Kong'ani from Kenya</li>
<li>Chinenye Ezeakor from Nigeria</li>
<li>Celestin Tchande from Cameroun</li>
<li>Ashabe Katushabe from Uganda</li>
<li>Lorrine Maleya from Kenya</li>
</ol><h2>Why we need your help?</h2>
<p>WAAW Foundation needs to continue this noble effort because most African girls do not have many opportunities to pursue their dream or have avenues to help them expand their horizons. <strong>Scholarship funds to support the education of college girls in Africa are practically nonexistent!</strong></p>
<p>We are about to launch our 2012 scholarship program on August 1, 2012 but we need to raise $5,000 to ensure that the scholarship initiative can continue. 100% of all funds raised will go towards the scholarship funds. All donations are tax deductible. WAAW executives and scholarship facilitators work on a volunteer basis, many times donating their time and resources as well.</p>
<p>We can no longer sustain this initiative alone. The stakes are high and the demands enormous, so we are asking <strong>you</strong> for help.</p>
<p>Our scholarship program is aimed at providing timely financial support to academically promising female African Students who are currently in STEM related undergraduate disciplines in an African College or University. Awardees must demonstrate financial need and a strong commitment to participating in building Africa. The initiative also promotes peers networks that provide support and mentoring to ensure completion in their chosen STEM fields. Preference is given to girls impacted by HIV and in their early years of study.</p>
<p>We can no longer sit back and watch dreams crushed! Girls like Chinenye and Ashabe need help to ensure their education continues and is not stalled due to financial reasons. They want to graduate and get out of the poverty that plagues Africa, they want to be able to make a difference in the world. Education is the key that can make it happen for them.</p>
<h2><strong>How can you help?</strong></h2>
<p>To help us and these African girls, we need your help in various ways such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Making a donation to our campaign now.</li>
<li>Encouraging your friends and/or family to make a contribution.</li>
<li>Spreading the word by using the Indiegogo share tools.</li>
</ul><p>Even the smallest donation will go a long way to help WAAW Foundation continue with its efforts to keep the dream alive in these girls one girl at a time.

<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Mount Albert Grammar School began rowing in 1936. The school has won eight National Championship Maadi Cups (including the first ever raced in 1947) and has a rich history in the sport. Rowing was absent from the school from 1984, but returned in full in 2009 and for the first time in history had a girls crew in 2011. Now more than ever we need your help to raise funds for MAGSROW to get our rowers further with equipment, training and transport. Your donation, no matter how big or small will help us achieve our vision to once again be the most successful school in New Zealand Rowing.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Why We Need Your Help</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Your donation will help our rowers in a number of ways. It will assist in buying new, and essential equipment for training our rowers including boats, rowing machines and Cox-boxes, plus maintaining them. We are up against schools with much more established rowing programmes but have already had great success despite being one of the under-dogs of the sport.</p>
<p>Also, the more we raise the more we can reduce fees so that students from all backgrounds can take part in what is an expensive but extremely rewarding sport.</p>
<p>The thing that sets us apart from other fundraising is the unique perks you can choose to the right of your screen. If you donate $25 you will receive a personal thank you letter from MAGSROW and signed by all of our senior rowers. For $50 you will get a 40-minute DVD of our 2011-2012 season with footage from multiple regattas and the prestigious Maadi Cup held in the South Island earlier this year. Finally for $150 you will receive an signed photo of our senior rowers for 2012. So with every donation there’s something in it for both of us, it’s a ‘win win!’</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Our Impact</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>MAGSROW not only builds strong rowers but also strong men and women. Our core values are Hard Work, Perseverance, Respect, Honesty and Responsibility. Our mission is to consistently produce rowers who can succeed as individuals and as part of a team, at school level and beyond. So with your help we can continue to implement these goals in our expanding rowing squad.</p>

<p>Hey. Thanks for taking some time to read this - we really do appreciate it</p>
<p><strong>Why is UnderstandBox a thing?</strong></p>
<p>We believe that our educational system is broken - if we're not in the Top 5 Nations when it comes to education, we're not doing good enough. We believe that it's not the people behind it who are broken, but the mentality and the tools that have become tradition; in the era of the tablet, does it really make sense to have students carrying around 50lbs of books? When electronics can be such useful tools, why do we keep chaining ourselves to the methods of the past?</p>
<p>The UnderstandBox team hopes to change our educational future by changing how teachers engage with students and how students engage with education as a whole. More and more, we're finding that personalized teaching wins over standardization any day - but no teacher has the ability to tailor lessons and work for 150, 200, 400+ students.</p>
<p>We feel our solution is an efficient and elegant way to change that.</p>
<p>UnderstandBox is an idea; we just want to help kids learn new and complex math concepts intuitively - and in doing so, fundamentally change how the STEM fields are taught. When high quality tools are put in the hands of subject matter experts, wonderful things happen.</p>
<p>That's what our company is all about, and what this project funds: our very first step in that direction.</p>
<p><strong>The UnderstandBox application suite: What does it do?</strong></p>
<p>UnderstandBox is a program that is both available as a stand-alone mobile app and as a website application, for those students who do not have a touchscreen enabled device. It allows students to move around parts of mathematical equations to discover how numbers and mathematical concepts interact with each other. The actual math-solving (the ""heavy-lifting"") occurs in the background, thereby allowing students free range to explore.</p>
<p>The application will be able to handle equations ranging from basic arithmetic to Calc I in it's first iteration; later expansions to the app will add more functionality. We have no plans to charge for updates to the UnderstandBox app - if you purchase it once, it should be free forever.</p>
<p>The overall UnderstandBox website will add extra functionality to the application right out of the box; teachers will be able to push equations to their students' applications, track time spent &amp; concepts learned (with parental consent) and be able to collaborate with each other on creating tailored lesson plans.</p>
<p>We eventually plan on adding in other resources for students on the website, such as pre-recorded and live instruction videos, as well as tying in other future UnderstandBox applications to make an entire educational software suite whose parts function either as stand-alone applications or as a whole, cohesive solution.</p>
<p><strong>Misc Q&amp;A:</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Q:</strong> So wait, I'm confused. Who's paying for what when you hit the market?</em></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> UnderstandBox is, at it's core, a self-study tool with multiple value-add additions. The core application(s) of the suite would be what is purchased, with the Teacher &amp; User collaboration abilities provided free.</p>
<p><em><strong>Q:</strong> Will you allow for user-created content? (Plugins, etc.?)</em></p>
<p><strong>A: </strong>Yes. We'll (of course) make sure to review plugins to make sure there's nothing wonky going on, but user-created content should be fine.</p>
<p><em><strong>Q:</strong> So what will the final price be? And where do you go from here?</em></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> We were thinking a one-time purchase between $3 - $5.00. From here, we'd move into Chemistry, Physics, and we even have a rough sketch for a Literary learning app. No idea what we'd charge for those, though.</p>

The application will be able to handle equations ranging from basic arithmetic to Calc I in it's first iteration; later expansions to the app will add more functionality. We have no plans to charge for updates to the UnderstandBox app - if you purchase it once, it should be free forever.
The overall UnderstandBox website will add extra functionality to the application right out of the box; teachers will be able to push equations to their students' applications, track time spent & concepts learned (with parental consent) and be able to collaborate with each other on creating tailored lesson plans.
We eventually plan on adding in other resources for students on the website, such as pre-recorded and live instruction videos, as well as tying in other future UnderstandBox applications to make an entire educational software suite whose parts function either as stand-alone applications or as a whole, cohesive solution.
Misc Q&A:
Q: So wait, I'm confused. Who's paying for what when you hit the market?
A: UnderstandBox is, at it's core, a self-study tool with multiple value-add additions. The core application(s) of the suite would be what is purchased, with the Teacher & User collaboration abilities provided free.
Q: Will you allow for user-created content? (Plugins, etc.?)
A: Yes. We'll (of course) make sure to review plugins to make sure there's nothing wonky going on, but user-created content should be fine.
Q: So what will the final price be? And where do you go from here?
A: We were thinking a one-time purchase between $3 - $5.00. From here, we'd move into Chemistry, Physics, and we even have a rough sketch for a Literary learning app. No idea what we'd charge for those, though.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign
