As
most all of you know, I have a passion for creating and playing music, and
would love to continue doing so for the rest of my life. This opportunity is
about my music. It is a once in a lifetime chance to get one of my songs
professionally produced, and by my favorite artist. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The name of
this Artist/producer is Aaron Gillespie. Aaron started out as the drummer of a
highly popular and Grammy-nominated hard-rock/hardcore band named Underoath.
After doing many years recording, writing, and touring with them, he went his
own way and started writing simple rock songs in a band that he started called
The Almost, as well as compiling original worship albums. At this point, he is
performing back on a reunion tour with Underoath, and leading worship at many
churches across the United States. He recently got into producing, and as a
result of that, I have been e-mailing back and forth with him to figure out how
I could make this work. </p>
<p>Due to several generous contributions inside and outside of this campaign, I have been able to reserve a spot and book a date at Aaron's studio in Salt Lake City, Utah. The recording will happen August 10-11 if I am financially able to work it out.</p>
<p> The demo I have done with the help of my musician and engineer friends (see YouTube video at the beginning of this) is  great to go off of for starters, but the production that would be done with this potential project would make this song the quality of a major song on the radio.</p>
<p>This is extremely exciting, but, as a college student, I cannot do it without financial help. </p> </div> <div> <h3>So... About the Money...</h3> <p>Up until now all of my funding for music production has come out of my own pocket. While I have been working extra hours at my two jobs, and even selling things on Craigslist to raise money for this project, school bills are starting to come down on me and I just simply don't have what I need to fund this amazing opportunity on my own.</p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;"">I am asking for $1,650. That is a lot, but I can break it down very simply so you know exactly where your money would go.</span></p>
<p><b>Where your funding would go: </b></p> <ul> <li>All the Recording, Mixing, Editing, and Polishing will add up to around $1500.</li>
<li>The Mastering itself will be around $150. Mastering is basically creating the ""final product."" It is polishing up the track, and making the volumes sync and all the EQ's of the track ready for iTunes, Spotify, Radio, etc.</li> </ul>
<div>If you donate any amount at all, and the project goes through, I will personally send you a free download link for the finished track.</div>
<div>If you donate $100 or more, I will get you the download link, put your name into the credits when the single is released, and send you a merch box that will have things like t-shirts, hats, and the like.</div>
<div>Any amount helps.</div>
<div>Because I have already been able to reserve a spot at the studio, the donations accrued from this point forward will be in aid of making this happen in reality, and solidifying the opportunity.</div>
<div>Just as I said, literally any amount that you give would help get my song and my music in general, out there to gain exposure. </div>
<div>If I raise more than enough funds, the money will go directly into the extended post-production of the other songs on Onward EP. </div> </div> <div> <h3>More Than Just A Song.</h3> <p>This song, ""Separation,"" means a lot to me. I wrote it when I was struggling through a long-distance relationship that was very hard. The process of writing, being angry, being hurt, and ultimately turning to God was a process that I still look back on as a cherished, and at times not so cherished memory.</p>
<p>However, this song is more than that. Ever since I wrote it, I have expanded the message and purpose of the song in my head to encapsulate a lot more than just relationships. To me, it represents the struggle of faith, and the struggle of facing adversity with resolute peace that is found in Christ. We all struggle, but it is the struggles that prove to us what really matters, and help define our values. </p>
<p><b>Here is the chorus of the song, so that you can gain a better picture: </b></p>
<p><i>""I think I see the point in all of this, but it's getting foggy now. </i></p>
<p><i>Oh Separation creates this hole in us, it's so unclear!</i></p>
<p><i>Soon well see it's not as endless as it seems now</i></p>
<p><i>Father give me strength to see, in truth and love.""</i></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>This philosophy
is also found in the music that Aaron plays and writes. I think working with
him would be a great experience and give me the opportunity to get my music out
there, and to make connections in ways that I did not even think possible. </b></p> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>As in any campaign, there is risk. Just because it is an incredibly well mixed and mastered single does not mean that it will make any waves in the highly competitive world of modern music. I am not in any way promising this. But there is a hope. And that hope is what drives me to keep trying.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Don't Have Money? No Problem.</h3> <p>If you just don't have money to donate, I completely understand. However, money is not the only way that you can help make this campaign successful. Sharing, whether that be through word of mouth, or through social media platforms like Facebook or Instagram, can be just as effective and sometimes even more, to gain support for this project. Through my campaign link, Indiegogo has many sharing tools that make it very easy to do so.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi. My name is Freddy Villano and I am the bassist, co-songwriter, co-producer and founding member of American Mafia. I am launching this campaign to help offset costs associated with mixing and mastering American Mafia's new, forthcoming 5-song EP, tentatively titled Made in New York. This new EP will feature the line-up of Don Chaffin (vocals), Tom Jude (guitar), Freddy Villano (bass) and Bobby Marks (drums). Mixing and mastering a CD is quite possibly the most crucial step in the record-making process and requires a pretty substantial investment for a quality result. We believe we’ve come up with a modest budget that will help us reach our goal (with your help of course!).</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our goal is $7500. We believe that amount will cover the costs associated with mixing and mastering the EP (mixing is already underway!). We’ve already done everything else that needs to happen, from tracking vocals, guitar, bass and drums, to some preliminary editing and rough mixing. The EP is already a year in the making and your contribution will help expedite the completion of the EP so that we can get it into a 2017 release schedule. </p>
<p>We will once again be using the team of Michael Harmon (Studio Crash) to mix and Chris Muth (Taloowa Corporation) to master. Both of these cats are well-renowned in their respective fields and did a stellar job on our debut CD, Rock N' Roll Hit Machine, so we already know they do extremely high quality work on air tight budgets. We are confident we will get the best results from these two esteemed professionals. You can learn more about them both here if you are interested:</p>
<p>Michael Harmon &amp; Studio Crash: <a href=""http://www.studiocrash.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.studiocrash.com</a></p>
<p>Chris Muth &amp; Taloowa Corporation: <a href=""http://taloowa.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://taloowa.com</a></p>
<p>We are offering many unique perks in exchange for your contribution. We will have autographed copies of American Mafia’s debut CD, Rock N' Roll Hit Machine (Grooveyard Records) available as well as autographed CDs of The Collected Sessions (Perris Records) by Holy Water. The autographed Collected Sessions CDs are exclusive to this Indiegogo campaign and can’t be found anywhere else. They are also limited to 70 copies. Holy Water was the band that directly preceded American Mafia and features some of the same musicians, many of whom performed and/or recorded with Foreigner, Quiet Riot, Dokken, Saraya, Widowmaker, Doro Pesch and more. This is a really unique perk that you won’t find anywhere else. And they are all autographed by these amazing players!</p>
<p>We are also making available a limited number of American Mafia t-shirts. Again this will be a limited supply item exclusive to this Indiegogo campaign. These are all essentially one-of-a-kind, airbrushed designs. If someone sees you with one of these particular t-shirts, they will know you are a contributor. It's a badge of honor!</p>
<p>Everyone who contributes will get listed in the liner notes of the new EP under a “special thanks” category. Tom is also making available personalized guitar picks from his personal collection for a very modest contribution.  Don is offering some Voices of Extreme  (his other band) swag and we will have American  Mafia posters available, signed by Don, Tom, Freddy and Bobby.</p>
<p>We are also offering a private showcase. We thought this would be a nice, once-in-a-lifetime chance to go behind the scenes and watch the band run through their set on a professional soundstage BEFORE they perform their first-ever live show. You’ll have a chance to get autographs, hang with the band, take video and participate in your own private concert!  How cool is that? We may also want to film this event for a future documentary, so there's that too!</p>
<p>Lastly, I'm making available some merch from my touring days with Quiet Riot and Widowmaker (featuring Dee Snider from Twisted Sister). There are a few ""Down to the Bone"" posters form the ""Bury the Bone"" tour I did with Quiet Riot as well as a commemorative t-shirt from our gig at the Limelight in NYC on August 23rd, 1995. There are also some Widowmaker shirts, a Finger Lakes Metal Fest shirt from the time I played there with Awaken and a cool Limelight shirt from the early 90s. None of the t-shirts have ever been worn and I think I can safely say, you won't find them anywhere else. There are many other perks as well, so please take some time to peruse the site.</p>
<p>Even if we do not reach our $7500 goal, all contributions will still go towards mixing and mastering the new EP. We are running what Indiegogo calls a ""flexible"" campaign so that we can allocate whatever we raise to help offset that expense. We truly feel that every contribution will help us meet our ultimate goal, which is releasing a new EP in 2017.</p>

<p>We’re not curing cancer and we don’t have any plans to release the next, most amazingly efficient clean energy product, but music is inherently important to people. American Mafia has a modest audience at this point, and even if only a fraction of you contribute, we are sure to reach our goal.  The consensus among our supporters thus far is that they love what we do, so we hope to broaden our appeal with this new release and bring our particular brand of rock and roll to as many people as possible in 2017. The EP will help us accomplish that goal. And your contribution will help us complete the EP.</p>
<p>Our debut CD, Rock N’ Roll Hit Machine was released in August 2014 on Grooveyard Records to critical acclaim. Ross Welford at uberrock.co.uk called it “…the best classic rock album you've never heard."" We feel that Hit Machine laid a solid foundation for us and has already paved the way for Made in New York to be an even greater success. Here’s what others have said about American Mafia and Rock N' Roll Hit Machine:</p>

<p>Hopefully, the fact that we’ve already successfully released one record (two if you want to count The Collected Sessions) demonstrates that we have the wherewithal to follow through on our promise and this process.  We will not squander your contribution. We have already been blessed with immeasurable support from  from friends and colleagues, with regard to artwork (Mark), promotion (Donna), videos (Don), website (Don &amp; Gina), studio time (Randy &amp; Don) and more. Without them, Rock N' Roll Hit Machine wouldn't have been such a success. And without them, we wouldn't be here today, mixing a new EP. Success does not happen in a vacuum. It is the result of collaboration and teamwork and we feel that this is the ultimate collaborative invitation: to have fans, friends, family, colleagues, etc. participate in this final, yet most important part, of making a record. </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I don't predict many obstacles to arise while accomplishing our objective. As I said previously, we have a flexible campaign, so we'll be able to keep whatever contributions you make, even if we don't meet our goal. This will allow us to offset some costs.

In the event that we don't meet the goal and it pushes the timing of a private showcase into question, we'll put together a package of goodies for those contributors that reflects the value of their contribution. Being an optimist, I truly believe we'll meet our goal. We look forward to sharing this incredible experience with you!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't contribute financially, that's ok too. Your support is still important and you can always help us ""spread the word.""  It would be of immeasurable help to us if you could share this fund raiser with people who might like our particular brand of rock and roll. One never knows where help might come from or who might want to participate in such an engaging endeavor. You can even use the Indiegogo's super smart sharing tool to help share it, but sharing it on Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat and/or whatever other social media network you prefer would be of immeasurable help too us when it comes to spreading the word about this campaign. This is a first for us, so we welcome you to come along for the ride!</p>
</div></div>","Short Summary
Hi. My name is Freddy Villano and I am the bassist, co-songwriter, co-producer and founding member of American Mafia. I am launching this campaign to help offset costs associated with mixing and mastering American Mafia's new, forthcoming 5-song EP, tentatively titled Made in New York. This new EP will feature the line-up of Don Chaffin (vocals), Tom Jude (guitar), Freddy Villano (bass) and Bobby Marks (drums). Mixing and mastering a CD is quite possibly the most crucial step in the record-making process and requires a pretty substantial investment for a quality result. We believe we’ve come up with a modest budget that will help us reach our goal (with your help of course!).

What We Need & What You Get
Our goal is $7500. We believe that amount will cover the costs associated with mixing and mastering the EP (mixing is already underway!). We’ve already done everything else that needs to happen, from tracking vocals, guitar, bass and drums, to some preliminary editing and rough mixing. The EP is already a year in the making and your contribution will help expedite the completion of the EP so that we can get it into a 2017 release schedule. 
We will once again be using the team of Michael Harmon (Studio Crash) to mix and Chris Muth (Taloowa Corporation) to master. Both of these cats are well-renowned in their respective fields and did a stellar job on our debut CD, Rock N' Roll Hit Machine, so we already know they do extremely high quality work on air tight budgets. We are confident we will get the best results from these two esteemed professionals. You can learn more about them both here if you are interested:
Michael Harmon & Studio Crash: http://www.studiocrash.com
Chris Muth & Taloowa Corporation: http://taloowa.com
We are offering many unique perks in exchange for your contribution. We will have autographed copies of American Mafia’s debut CD, Rock N' Roll Hit Machine (Grooveyard Records) available as well as autographed CDs of The Collected Sessions (Perris Records) by Holy Water. The autographed Collected Sessions CDs are exclusive to this Indiegogo campaign and can’t be found anywhere else. They are also limited to 70 copies. Holy Water was the band that directly preceded American Mafia and features some of the same musicians, many of whom performed and/or recorded with Foreigner, Quiet Riot, Dokken, Saraya, Widowmaker, Doro Pesch and more. This is a really unique perk that you won’t find anywhere else. And they are all autographed by these amazing players!
We are also making available a limited number of American Mafia t-shirts. Again this will be a limited supply item exclusive to this Indiegogo campaign. These are all essentially one-of-a-kind, airbrushed designs. If someone sees you with one of these particular t-shirts, they will know you are a contributor. It's a badge of honor!
Everyone who contributes will get listed in the liner notes of the new EP under a “special thanks” category. Tom is also making available personalized guitar picks from his personal collection for a very modest contribution.  Don is offering some Voices of Extreme  (his other band) swag and we will have American  Mafia posters available, signed by Don, Tom, Freddy and Bobby.
We are also offering a private showcase. We thought this would be a nice, once-in-a-lifetime chance to go behind the scenes and watch the band run through their set on a professional soundstage BEFORE they perform their first-ever live show. You’ll have a chance to get autographs, hang with the band, take video and participate in your own private concert!  How cool is that? We may also want to film this event for a future documentary, so there's that too!
Lastly, I'm making available some merch from my touring days with Quiet Riot and Widowmaker (featuring Dee Snider from Twisted Sister). There are a few ""Down to the Bone"" posters form the ""Bury the Bone"" tour I did with Quiet Riot as well as a commemorative t-shirt from our gig at the Limelight in NYC on August 23rd, 1995. There are also some Widowmaker shirts, a Finger Lakes Metal Fest shirt from the time I played there with Awaken and a cool Limelight shirt from the early 90s. None of the t-shirts have ever been worn and I think I can safely say, you won't find them anywhere else. There are many other perks as well, so please take some time to peruse the site.
Even if we do not reach our $7500 goal, all contributions will still go towards mixing and mastering the new EP. We are running what Indiegogo calls a ""flexible"" campaign so that we can allocate whatever we raise to help offset that expense. We truly feel that every contribution will help us meet our ultimate goal, which is releasing a new EP in 2017.

The Impact
We’re not curing cancer and we don’t have any plans to release the next, most amazingly efficient clean energy product, but music is inherently important to people. American Mafia has a modest audience at this point, and even if only a fraction of you contribute, we are sure to reach our goal.  The consensus among our supporters thus far is that they love what we do, so we hope to broaden our appeal with this new release and bring our particular brand of rock and roll to as many people as possible in 2017.

<h3>What It's About</h3>
<p>Like I said, I've been recording some crappy demos, by myself, for over four years now as Atheists - and much longer as various other pseudonyms. But over the past couple months, while writing and recording songs that will likely make up the bulk up my next record, I was struck with the idea that it was time to move into new territory - and that territory is actual, good-quality recording!</p>
<p>I reached out to some of my music-student friends from college (Hi Cam! Hi Ruby!) and asked their advice. Could I record at our alma mater? Should I not do that? I asked if they knew anyone with a home-based studio, or access to a real one. This is what led me to one of their classmates, Bobbi Giel, who has graciously agreed to help me with this project at the end of January. We are both going to be pushing and challenging ourselves with this project, especially given that we will only have less than 48 hours to record everything. So, things started to look up. Serendipity!</p>
<p>But now come the costs of such a venture, and that's where you kind folks come in.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The goal above says $500, but that's only because IndieGogo makes you put that as a minimum. Truthfully, I am only seeking what you are all willing to give. I would have probably set it $100 if I could have, but it isn't really about a minimum or maximum - it's about asking for your generosity and accepting its myriad forms, if you feel so inclined to send some my way. That means you can donate however much money you want if you are able, but you can also simply share my campaign. Word of mouth IS help! So, ignore the goal above, and just help out if you can and if you want to. Every tiny bit helps.</p>
<p>The money will go toward a few things:</p>
<ul>
<li>For one, Bobbi lives in New York, and I don't, so I will need to get down there and get around. Being the broke graduate student I am, this alone poses a challenge, so any assistance will go a long way in even getting me down to her. </li>
<li>The money will also go toward food while I'm down there. </li>
<li>I would like to be able to pay the people who help me in crafting this product. This includes anyone who helps me produce it, who may play on it (if that lovely opportunity arises), if I get help mastering it, etc. It is very nice to be able to pay the people who use their honed craft to help you make your project a reality. (I'm sure these people would agree.)</li>
<li>Finally, the money will also go toward creating physical versions of the album on CD. I would love to make vinyls, but I don't really know how to go about creating one's own vinyl LPs - and if anyone has any tips on that, let me know! - but mostly I would make CDs, with artwork and everything. You'll see these down in the perks. Ultimately, this may be the most expensive part of this project, if enough people get them - printing the artwork, buying the CDs and cases, and then shipping them out. It gets very expensive. But I am offering them as a perk because I know people like having a physical copy of what they helped support. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What It Means</h3>
<p>I know some of you might not give a crap if I get to make a real album or not, especially if you don't know me. But I am asking for help because this is a passion project for me, and after recording so many songs and albums over the years that sound like garbage, I am ready to take the next step and make a good, quality recording for everyone to hear. Music is extremely important to me, and this feels like an organic step in my artistic process. In a way, this feels a lot like my first album, and I would love if you guys would be a part of it, coming along for the ride with me.</p>

For one, Bobbi lives in New York, and I don't, so I will need to get down there and get around. Being the broke graduate student I am, this alone poses a challenge, so any assistance will go a long way in even getting me down to her. 
The money will also go toward food while I'm down there. 
I would like to be able to pay the people who help me in crafting this product. This includes anyone who helps me produce it, who may play on it (if that lovely opportunity arises), if I get help mastering it, etc. It is very nice to be able to pay the people who use their honed craft to help you make your project a reality. (I'm sure these people would agree.)
Finally, the money will also go toward creating physical versions of the album on CD. I would love to make vinyls, but I don't really know how to go about creating one's own vinyl LPs - and if anyone has any tips on that, let me know! - but mostly I would make CDs, with artwork and everything. You'll see these down in the perks. Ultimately, this may be the most expensive part of this project, if enough people get them - printing the artwork, buying the CDs and cases, and then shipping them out. It gets very expensive. But I am offering them as a perk because I know people like having a physical copy of what they helped support. 


What It Means
I know some of you might not give a crap if I get to make a real album or not, especially if you don't know me. But I am asking for help because this is a passion project for me, and after recording so many songs and albums over the years that sound like garbage, I am ready to take the next step and make a good, quality recording for everyone to hear. Music is extremely important to me, and this feels like an organic step in my artistic process. In a way, this feels a lot like my first album, and I would love if you guys would be a part of it, coming along for the ride with me.

<p>Bonjour,</p>
<p>Nous sommes TERRATO, un groupe de percussions Brésiliennes (<i>batucada</i>) établi à Montréal depuis plus de 8 ans.  Nous jouons principalement de la Samba-reggae, un style de musique originaire de Salvador da Bahia au Brésil depuis le début des années 80.  Nos influences principales sont les groupes <i>Olodum</i> et <i>Timbalada</i>, tous les deux provenant de la province de Bahia au Brésil. Mais nous jouons aussi d’autres styles musicaux Brésiliens tels que : Samba carioca, Axé, MPB et Frevo.   Depuis 2008 TERRATO à performé plus de 600 spectacles à travers le Québec et le Canada. Nous offrons des performances avec tambours seulement pour des petites fêtes, manifestations, parades et festivals extérieurs.  Mais nous offrons aussi un spectacle avec orchestre complet (3 chanteurs/chanteuses, 4 cuivres, cavaquinho, guitare et basse) pour des performances sur scène.  Durant nos spectacles nous déployons énormément d’énergie et avec le son et la puissance des tambours les spectateurs sont généralement incapables de demeurer assis! </p>
<p>Le groupe a déjà produit un premier album complet « Oxigenio » en 2014.  Depuis ce premier opus nous avons créé et accumulé beaucoup de nouvelles compositions et nous sommes maintenant prêts à produire notre 2<sup>ième</sup> album ainsi que notre premier vidéoclip officiel.   Nous avons des compositions écrites en Brésilien, Anglais, Français et Créole.  Donc, TERRATO est véritablement un groupe de musique multiculturel avec des racines musicales profondément Brésiliennes. </p>
<p>Pourquoi nous avons besoin de VOTRE contribution ?</p>
<p>Les coûts de productions d’un album sont considérables, même pour un projet d’autoproduction d’envergure modeste.  Il faut considérer les frais de studio pour l’<strong>enregistrement</strong> des chansons, le <strong>mixage</strong> final qui peut prendre en moyenne de 3 à 5 heures par chanson et finalement l’étape de <strong>matriçage </strong>(ou <i>mastering</i>) qui est la plus importante.  Tout ceci coûte environs $5000 au minimum.</p>
<p>De plus, nous voulons aussi ramasser des fonds pour la production d’un éventuel vidéoclip ce qui coûte autant à produire qu’un album complet!  Voilà pourquoi nous avons besoin de votre aide.  Nous avons vraiment hâte de vous faire entendre nos nouvelles tounes!

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>We are TERRATO, a Brazilian percussion group (<i>batucada</i>) established in Montréal since over 8 years.  Our style of music is mainly Samba-reggae, a musical style originating from Salvador da Bahia, Brazil since the early 80’s.  Our main influences come from the well-known bands Olodum and Timbalada, both based in the province of Bahia, Brazil. But the band also plays other Brazilian musical styles and rhythms such as: Samba carioca, Axé, MPB and Frevo.   Since 2008 TERRATO has performed more than 600 shows across Québec and Canada. We offer performances with drums only for small parties, marches, parades and outdoor festivals.  But we also offer a full-band ensemble (3 singers, 4 horns, cavaquinho, guitar and bass) for onstage shows.  During our shows we produce enormous amounts of energy and when combined with the sound and power of the live drums the spectators simply cannot stay seated!</p>
<p>In 2014 the band produced their first full-length album « Oxigenio ».  Since that first release we have created and accumulated many new compositions and we are now ready to produce our second full-length album as well as our first official video clip.   Our songs are written in Brazilian, English, French and Creole.  Therefore, TERRATO is definitely a multicultural band with strong Brazilian musical roots.</p>
<p>Why are we asking for YOUR contribution ?</p>
<p>The production costs for a full-length album can be considerable, even for a modest auto-produced project.  One must consider the studio costs for the <strong>recording</strong> of the songs, the final <strong>mixing</strong> process which can take from 3 to 5 hours per song on average and the <strong>mastering</strong> which is the final and most important aspect of production.  All of this can easily cost a minimum of $5000 in total.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we are in need of funds for the production of an upcoming video clip which can easily cost as much as the album itself!  That is why we are asking for your help. We can’t wait to make you hear our new songs! So please help us produce our marvelous new musical project by encouraging the best Samba-reggae band in Canada.  Obrigado!!</p>

<p>Gigkat is a sophisticated music app for iphone and android serving both artists and fans.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>For Artists! </b>Gigkat allows artists to have their own app with a marketing platform that provides actionable, easy-to-use marketing &amp; promotion tools. Artists can follow fans by geo-location and have real time analytics on the growth and popularity of their music. All this provides each artist with the equivalent of a $150,000 mobile app!</p>

Any aspect of performing, such as assisting with performance and attending musical performance.

<p></p>
<h4>kat :</h4>
<p>A slang term used in the 50's by jazz musicians that literally means musician.<br/><font color=""#ffffff"">.</font></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Gigkat was created for artists who were looking for an app that would
provide them a platform to showcase their work, give them the promotion ability
to connect with existing fans within specific geographies, and provide them with
a marketing platform that would help accelerate their discovery by new fans. </p>
<p>After much consulting between artists, fans, managers, music executives and
some of the best software developers in the country, Gigkat was created. The
platform gives artists an app that meets all their needs plus many extra
features to help promote and monetize themselves. </p>
<p>Despite the plethora of social media platforms and the ease at which people
now communicate, <b>no one else has developed a platform specific to the music industry
that allows artists and fans the ability to relate directly with one another</b>.
Gigkat was developed to specifically meet that need. </p>
<p>The company is managed by a team of experts in their field along with
successful artists and musicians. <br/></p>

Gigkat is a sophisticated music app for iphone and android serving both artists and fans.

For Artists! Gigkat allows artists to have their own app with a marketing platform that provides actionable, easy-to-use marketing & promotion tools. Artists can follow fans by geo-location and have real time analytics on the growth and popularity of their music. All this provides each artist with the equivalent of a $150,000 mobile app!
For Fans! Gigkat provides fans with a simple tool to discover and interact with new artists & their music. Fans can watch video, listen to music, be updated on concerts and see ads and sponsored promotions.
gig :
Any aspect of performing, such as assisting with performance and attending musical performance.


kat :
A slang term used in the 50's by jazz musicians that literally means musician..


Gigkat was created for artists who were looking for an app that would
provide them a platform to showcase their work, give them the promotion ability
to connect with existing fans within specific geographies, and provide them with
a marketing platform that would help accelerate their discovery by new fans. 
After much consulting between artists, fans, managers, music executives and
some of the best software developers in the country, Gigkat was created. The
platform gives artists an app that meets all their needs plus many extra
features to help promote and monetize themselves. 
Despite the plethora of social media platforms and the ease at which people
now communicate, no one else has developed a platform specific to the music industry
that allows artists and fans the ability to relate directly with one another.
Gigkat was developed to specifically meet that need. 
The company is managed by a team of experts in their field along with
successful artists and musicians.

<p>I make my living playing piano. I also love to create music for people and the projects they have to help bring their musical dreams to life.</p>
<p>I play at Glastonbury Healing Field most years and really enjoy the connection that comes from playing the piano there and everyone singing along. </p>
<p>I am also planning to launch a spiritually based business in the new year which will also incorporate music.  </p>
<p>It's such a pleasure playing songs for people on the piano. Bringing joy and happy atmospheres wherever I play. I love creating music in my studio. You can lose hours getting lost meditatively in a track. There is such a wonder in hearing all the layers grow in a piece of music. However, my equipment is starting to creak a little with old age, I would like to be able to write and produce music at the level needed to help others with their music and songs to the highest standard.</p>
<p>If you can help me with my funding, you will give me and my studio a new lease of life, that will also help many people who come to me. I will be able to record vocals and produce tracks and encourage others with their musical visions to the very best of my ability.

<li>In order to get the highest quality recording in my studio, I need to upgrade my equipment.

</div><div> <p>I am doing this because, I make a living as a musician, which I am very grateful for. I'm a walking miracle, I was born partially deaf and yet in the same body I have perfect pitch and a reservoir of a repertoire of songs I can play. Music flows through me like a radio station. I tune in and it literally flows through. It is amazing. I wish to share that gift with the world as much as I possibly can. I'm a single parent of two wonderful teenagers, so being able to splash out on studio equipment by myself would be too big a chunk of my earnings to achieve. They are both musicians too, My daughter sings beautifully and plays piano and soprano sax and my son is a very gifted guitar player. Music is a big part of our family. </p>
<p>I wish to provide the best quality of service I possibly can. To bring happiness to others. To help their musical and spiritual aspirations take flight. I love what music does for people. </p> <ul><br/></ul>
<ul> <li>If you are a musician or singer, I can help you alot once my studio is finished. Specially with the new ProTools 12 having the facility to connect and record with musicians all over the world so it won't matter where you live. I can still help you. </li>
<li>Music is the language of the soul, it connects people, it heals people. To have music in my life is such a blessing. I would like to pass that blessing on to others. </li> <li>Your help would be so deeply appreciated and I am very grateful to you for reading my pitch. </li>
<li>If you wish to connect with me on Periscope/gillybeanmusic I broadcast on there regularly. I would love to play a song for you on there. </li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>

I now recognise I am not an island and it is ok to reach out. There is a vulnerability in that but it is a good thing. If my funding goes a little slowly then I will continue to manage on what I have here which has served me very well, though ultimately the reason I have made this page it because I need to grow more as a musician and a producer.</p> <ul> <li>I'm a very resiliant upbeat, contented grateful pianolady who adores her job and loves people so no matter what is happening here there are always wonders and miracles in your life to appreciate.</li> <li>I believe that what is meant to be for you will be, So if this is a success then that is wonderful and if it is not then The Universe will guide me.

<h2><b>Completion </b></h2>
<p>We’re close. Craftworks is 75-80% complete. All of the components are there but so are the bugs. Most things work really well and other things don’t work really well but will with some attention and a little code love. The Craftworks Visual Editor, where you create the control surfaces and applications, gets the job done but feels clunky and is in need of an all over polishing and some components like the way protocols are handled in the GUI are disjointed, confusing and needing an overhaul to become consistent and easier to digest. A lot of other issues I feel are more esthetic and will be resolved with the addition of a 3rd party graphics engine such as Unity (please watch our pitch video for a better visual). Apologies in advance for getting a little windy and technical but l think it’s important to relay something neat: we have two methods of displaying graphics right now in Craftworks. One is through modified and semi-proprietary embedded browsers for Craftworks controls created with HTML5/Javascript. The other is essentially the standard Windows graphics engine, which if you’re a Windows user - that's the engine pumping out what you're staring at right now and in programming, it isn’t too great on its own without a lot of help. With a 3D engine like Unity, we would be able to take better advantage of hardware acceleration and some pretty fancy effects plus some out-of-this-world visual and spatial concepts like representing controls as animated 3D objects like you would see in a video game or model hyper accurate guitar strings - strum on a 7000 string guitar kinda stuff :). We could also take advantage of tens of thousands of already created 3D objects out there in the public domain and add physics and function to them. What we as a community could end up creating could be pretty darn special. The end goal!</p>

</div>
<p>..is $80,000..every dollar buys about a minute of development time for 1.5 developers and with every minute Craftworks gets better and closer to release. Our beta program starts quickly with our backers whether we hit this goal or not and you'd be missing out on not only getting your hands on something fun during the beta but also being part of the decision-making community and the good feels of being part of what I think could be something great..something that has already been used in some amazing places and with some amazing people.</p>
<p><b>If we flop and bomb:</b> We're still a go but will be slower to release, no hiring and I'll just keep trudging along a little slower than before because I'll have to split time with full time consulting work..but she's my love and we'll make it after all :D. </p>
<p><b>If we hit or even get close to our goal:</b> We’ll be able to go turbo and immediately bring two more skilled local developers on board and switch over to putting the finishing touches on it, creating sample code, documentation, tools and help videos and also create a <b>community portal and marketplace*</b> for hosting user created content for controls, control surfaces, applications and tools within six months, +/- a month. </p>
<p>* This marketplace would be for YOU to share &amp; sell your controls &amp; control surfaces. We will never sell add-ons, controls or control surfaces. When you buy Craftworks, you get it and all updates for life..free.</p>

<p>Whether we hit our goal or not we will be packaging up and shipping out our backer rewards and some Craftworks components to the backers that have paid for them so they can start beta testing soon after campaigns close but for some components we need to address copy protection / piracy concerns with our new community which could extend some things out a little longer while having to possibly finalize a copy protection vendor (recommendations open!), ordering, receiving, testing and then the physical shipping of something out which more than likely will be a tiny USB dongle with added gold color so the folks that back us stick out and can show off a little. It’s a difficult subject for me and a struggle - I personally understand and feel the disdain for the DMCA and copy protection in general but also understand the plight of the small business trying to protect their products from abuse and if you decide to back us - I would like to take this issue up in one of our forums and get your input.. with some hand holding, patting on the head and being told everything will be alright - we could just as easy be convinced out of locking Craftworks down since piracy always seems to win unless we do something dumb and 'Cloud-y'. </p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<div>I think we have something extra special going on here with this software. We've used it in some pretty incredible places already, like working with kids that haven't had a lot of exposure to music, many never having played an instrument before and our keyboard shines here and immediately brightens them up. Amazing stuff. We hope our community can bring Craftworks down into their own physical / real life communities and do similar things with it - and if you do - PLEASE contact us.. we know how hard it can be setting up a community program and can help you out with free software, other good schwag and tell you about some vendors that have been generous to us in the past!</div>
<div>I would like to keep the price of Craftworks low. Hardware that Craftworks can run on can be picked up as low as $80, so the software shouldn't be more than the hardware in my humble opinion. The cost of a video game seems reasonable (around $60) and depending on the cost of Unity and USB dongle copy protection it could hit as high as that $80 but I would like to avoid that as much as possible and if that is the price you can bet it will be on sale a bunch.</div>

</div><div><span><br/></span></div><p></p></div>","Craftworks (CUI)! For 3D Modelers, Photographers, Illustrators, Musicians, DJ’s, Makers, Lighting and Stage Effect Engineers, Videographers and Video Editors, Recording and Audio Engineers and still within the realm of the digital creative arts - GAMERS and other art consumers like HOME THEATER and ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM enthusiasts and there's probably a lot more out there that we don't know about - these are the ones that we have seen Craftworks change everything for!We’ve spent the past nearly 3 years and every penny developing Craftworks: a user interface designer, control surface and simplified development platform for the creative electronic-digital arts and artists.WIN SOME STUFF: VISIT our website 2io.io or Facebook to sign up to WIN a bunch of the hardware and software we used to build Craftworks..all gifts from Dell and Apple when we were starting out: Macbook Pro 15"", The LARGE 24"" TOUCHSCREEN you see in most of the images, Tablets and some USB Computer-on-a-stick's!User interface / control surface for 3D Modeling:""3D Pads"" for controlling the plane and object..


For NON-TECHIES: Save a BUNCH of creativity and frustration by not having to think about controlling your software and hardware AND save a BUTTLOAD of cash by not having to buy a bunch of hardware devices that can only do one thing instead of one device that can do it all or one that compliments analog or physical controllers uniquely well - drawing pads for illustrators surrounded by digital and highly configurable buttons.. 


..like here with all Photoshop menu functions & tools made  handy:

 

For THE TECHIES: With the Craftworks Visual Editor, our built-in easy and designed for artists scripting language SonicScript, in addition to the beautiful language Lua and common HTML5/Javascript support, it's large list of supported protocols and capacity to convert between them, it’s physical computing interfaces for both Arduino & Raspberry Pi, it's ability to communicate with audio programming and audio processing languages like ChucK and SuperCollider, and it’s networked mouse & keyboard drivers for PC & Mac all ensure there are not many software applications or hardware devices Craftworks can’t control OR  emulate.

Some views of Craftworks Visual Editor / Designer

  
In general: Using it is just a sh!t ton of fun. I’ve spent half of the last 2+ years just playing with it like a little kid (waaay too much probably).. the tool pulls you in with all of its creative diversions and is so addictively fun..and to toot my own horn a bit: it’s some pretty incredible stuff! :D





We need..

..a COMMUNITY and a community of help! I’ve turned away inquiries and avoided outside funding and bootstrapped this as much as I could and so close to the finish line I can’t afford to keep it going and even when we get to the finish line - covering the costs involved in amping up for a product release can be dream smashing.

Apologies in advance for getting a little windy and technical but l think it’s important to relay something neat: we have two methods of displaying graphics right now in Craftworks.

Since then, I have been learning how write songs that are engaging, meaningful, and which draw from the kaleidoscopic set of musical influences which has been the backdrop of my life.
I have produced several of the Vertebrats releases, including two CDs and an LP called Screaming Like a Mad Choir. I have also done lots of other musical projects in Illinois and Colorado, including live cabarets, songwriter circles, and straight up rock band shows.
When my son Tazwell began learning fiddle, the world of California Bluegrass opened up to me. Which brings us to this project.


What is Move My Car?

This campaign represents my opportunity to select my favorite recent tunes and showcase them in the best possible light and share them with the world.
It's also my chance to work with some absolutely world-class musicians:

So where do you come in? Well, I could record these songs on my own, but instead I want to work with these fantastic musicians and the awesome StudioE where we'll be recording ( https://www.facebook.com/Studio-E-479771965406834/ ). Dave Grisman is in there now.


$5,650 will get us a day in the studio and the ability to hire these great players for at least 3 of these songs. If we raise more, we'll record more tunes.
It's easy to pre-purchase the digital download - just $10! From there, fun perks are added, including CDs and gorgeous BrowBeaters schwag.
For the higher levels, you can get sponsor or even producer credit on the recording, as well as other fancy gifts. Branding on our perks was created by local visual artist Miriam Klein Stahl with an NYT bestselling book to her credit. ( http://www.radamericanwomen.com/ ) If we hit only part of our goal, we'll still go into the studio for a shorter time and record fewer songs. 
So thanks for listening to this appeal, and I hope you decide to help us.   Your Impact These songs were written to be stylistically expansive, personally inspiring, and musically enriching. Examples:


Danger: An ode to survivor's guilt from the point of view of a Syrian refugee.
The Dream People: An observational gospel tune about the hidden powers of eccentrics.
 Move My Car - about the deep emotion behind everyday interactions.

They are arranged specifically to showcase the vibrant strain of Northern California Bluegrass which surrounds us here in Berkeley.

<p>Hello everyone
and welcome to the music video project of the Jazz Version „Makedonsko devojce“.
</p>
<p>It is one oft he most
popular songs in the country and this is the very first time, that this song
has been interpretated in a modern Jazz Version, which makes it very unique.</p>
<p>How this project
started: </p>
<p>I've been
travelling all my life to Macedonia and always enjoyed singing ""Makedonsko
devojce"" in different countries. My goal was an international version of
the song, so that people, who do not speak the language understand the lyrics.</p>
<p>3 years ago, I
started to translate the song in english and spanish while I was on vacation in
France. A year later I had the chance to work with the Folks Band ""Drim
Tim"". They have been touring for years all over the globe, which even
confirmed my opinion, that they are the band to make this song a success. </p>
<p>Seven musicians
and me were recording the song. The result is an international Jazz/ Latino
version of Makedonsko devojce. The most important goal for me is to produce the
song with Macedonians. Starting with talented Directors, Screenwriters, Set
assistance, Make Up Artists, Hairstylists, DOP, Fashion Designer, Location and
many more!</p>
<p>This is an
absolute heart- project and we would really want to make it representative for
Macedonians living in and outside the country. </p>
<p>We would love you
to participate and support the production of a classy music video. </p>
<p>In honor to the artists, who own the
copyrights, we wanna make it right and buy the rights for the Jazz- Version. </p>
<p>To make this project work, we will
be buying the costumes for the characters. </p>
<p>The postproduction is also an important
part of the music video.</p>
<p>All producers will be listed (optionally
anonym) in the end of the song.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Let´s make it a unique project!</p>

<p><b>WHAT IS UP?!</b></p>
<p>My name is Jameson Tabor, and I’m a Dance-Pop singer and songwriter.  I’m originally from Portland, Oregon, but moved to Los Angeles 10 months ago to pursue my career in music.  I am so excited to release my debut album <i>PURSUIT</i> this fall, and an original music video of one of the songs on the album to promote it!  Now I need your help to finish them up professionally.</p><p>This album is a positive and empowering journey about pursuing your dreams and the emotional struggles one must face to do so.<br/></p>
<p>I grew up playing piano, singing and dancing in shows, directing various bands and choirs, and even writing original music for five different musicals.  Yet, despite all of my obvious passion for music, the narrative I always told myself was that I was going to be an actor.  I think my fear of the unknown professional music world blinded me, and I felt like I didn’t know where to start.  So, I talked myself out of it.  Finally, after being forced by a dear friend to take an honest look at myself and my actions, I realized that music has always been the driving force of my life.</p>
<p>I believe that true happiness in life comes from doing what you love.  That is this journey for me—following my passion, understanding my dreams, and conquering the forces and fears surrounding that.  That is why I’ve decided to title the album <i>PURSUIT.</i></p>
<p>I am writing pop music that is unique and thoughtful, that is always fun to dance and listen to, but that also carries insight and perspective.  I hope to be a light for others who need it, and to help them view the world around them as an awesome place, through images and stories they can relate to.  What good is music if nobody hears it?  Or worse, if people hear negative messages and generic lyrics?  There is too much hate, selfishness and blame out there in the world.  So many people go through times of depression, deep sorrow, injustice, and abuse.  It’s something I have been personally affected by, as have so many others.  That is reality.</p>
<p>And so, I hope to inspire confidence, optimism and light in the darkness, through honest, emotional moments that bring people together.  There is something about music that unites all of us, no matter where we are at, what country we are from or what language we speak.  </p>
<p>We must always come together and dance!</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1469767941/12507396_891691980949461_287776672025593347_n_ugqfdm.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<p>
</p><p><b>WHAT I NEED:</b></p>
<p>One thing I’ve learned this last year of getting real with myself is when to ask for help!</p><p>I feel I have done absolutely all that I can with the resources I have to make this thing happen.  There was actually a point this last year when my wife Jenna and I literally had $23 in our bank account, because we were both so committed to this music and what I am creating!  I’ve learned how to record and produce music at a professional level, read countless books and articles on the music industry, and taken online courses on how to build passive income and gain exposure through effective online marketing.  I didn’t know how, but I knew that we would eventually make it through.  Now I think I can see the light!</p>
<p>I need your help to make the finishing touches a reality.  </p>
<p><i>BUDGET: </i></p><p>If you aren’t familiar with the music creation process, it's a complicated and expensive one.  I am seeking to raise $7500 to cover the following expenses:</p>
<p>• Hiring professional dance music Mixer/Producer (Shok)</p>
<p>• Professional mastering of the album</p>
<p>• Purchase of new speakers and cables to assist in editing process</p>
<p>• Online and physical distribution of the album to iTunes, Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon, etc. through CD Baby</p>
<p>• Photoshoot with professional photographer</p>
<p>• Hiring graphic designer to create the album cover art and logo</p>
<p>• Creation of press releases for album, and pre-launch single</p>
<p>• Advertising of album through Facebook and YouTube ads</p>
<p>• Updated website domain purchase and design</p>
<p>• Merchandise creation: CDs, t-shirts and photos</p>
<p>• Fashion design materials for music video</p>
<p>• Scenic design materials for music video</p>
<p>• Purchase of stock CGI green-screen footage</p>
<p>• Transportation and food for music video crew</p>
<p>• Submission of music video to nationwide festivals</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>WHAT YOU GET!</b></p>
<p>You guys, I am so excited for this.  There are so many things you can get in return for helping me fund this project!  Check out the perks on the side for a gift that suits you best.</p><p>There is an exclusive <i>PURSUIT </i>album t-shirt design, as well as an Exclusive Listening Party where you can share your reactions to the album live with me. Get an hour of one-on-one time with me in a voice lesson (I teach through The Tabor Studio), OR be featured in an upcoming music video!  You can even get 2 VIP tickets to an upcoming live show, OR have me compose you a completely original song!</p><p><br/></p>
<p>
</p><p><b>YOUR IMPACT: THE TEAM &amp; ME</b></p>
<p>With your help, at the end of this summer, these songs will be released professionally to the public.  Anyone will be able to find them and enjoy them!</p>
<p>The money this campaign raises is crucial to the success of the music I'm making.  Without this funding, the end product will be of lesser quality and likely to stay, for the most part, unheard.  I am confident that with enough of my supporters out there giving what they can, this will all come together and we will SURPASS our goal!  :)</p>
<p>Here are some of the folks who are already making this happen:</p>
<p><i>MY MUSIC CREW: </i></p><p>Pop album production can take months of time, multiple producers and hundreds of thousands of dollars to pay for equipment and time.  Luckily, I have already done most of the production myself, so now it’s just a matter of being able to pay for the finishing touches.  I have found a killer Electronic Dance Music (EDM) Producer, Shok, who has been working in the industry for years, and has already been providing me with tons of free knowledge and mixing/mastering assistance.  I absolutely trust his musical sensibility and expertise. </p>
<p>Co-writer, Alica Martwick and I have worked diligently, daily, to create the lyrical content of the songs.  She is a skilled poet, dedicated collaborator, and brilliant storyteller.  She has created some truly beautiful work for this album.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC VIDEO TEAM:</i> </p><p>I have assembled a Music Video team that is incredibly talented and capable.  These are working artists, almost all of whom I have collaborated with before.  Director Sara Alessandrini, Cinematographer Ona Isart, Fashion Designer Alec Remington, Scenic Designer Colin Lawrence, CGI Creator Nikhil Newse and Production Manager Jenna Tabor are already hard at work.  I can’t wait to launch our video (likely about one month prior to the album release)!  They really should be and usually are paid for their time and expertise, so they are all incredibly understanding of the needs of this project in offering to work unpaid.  All of these folks are honest, hardworking individuals, with great heart.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1469767995/Screen_Shot_2016-07-25_at_5.16.46_PM_ylsdnk.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<p>
</p><p><b>RISKS &amp; CHALLENGES</b></p>
<p>Certainly in any art, the biggest risk is that all of this time, energy and money is spent on something that nobody ends up liking.  If I weren’t real with you up front about the fear on my end, I would be a huge liar!  It’s something that I think about every day, ALL THE TIME, while still trying to let go and let the creative juices flow.</p>
<p>These songs have all been around the block at this point.  They’ve been in and out of demo, editing, recording, rewriting, and finalizing phases too many times to count!  Songs have been written and scrapped, and some have been reincarnated with a twist.  Of all the music I've been working on, these 7 songs, are the ones I'm drawn to them time and time again.  They have gotten great feedback from a variety of test-group sources and trained musical ears that have indicated that each of these songs is a potential hit in one market or another.  I personally believe in all of these songs, and can’t wait for them all to take on a life of their own.</p>
<ul>
<p><b>OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP:</b></p>
<p>Hey look, I get it.  Not everyone can donate $100, or even buy a CD.  That’s okay.  You can still be a huge help in getting the word out about this campaign!</p>
<p><b><i>Here are some other great ways you can help:</i></b></p>
<p>1 • Use the Indiegogo share tools on the page, OR make a post yourself on Social Media and link it to here.  Everyone can appreciate your passion, so don’t be afraid to share it!</p>
<p>2 • Tell your friends, at school, at work.  Tell your family members!  It’s huge to just get some BUZZ going.  Who knows who might be interested, or whose day you might brighten with the music!</p>
<p>3 • Stream the songs on <a href=""https://open.spotify.com/artist/4oYOiDPqfJNGpVH4Mrk0Sn"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Spotify</a> or another streaming platform when they come out!  Did you know that artists get paid and played more based on how often their music is heard?  Also, playlist creators and small radio stations are always looking for that next hit song, so help build up the plays!</p>
<p>4 • Always stay up-to-date on my future releases and events by subscribing to my email list.  Email me at: jameson.tabor@gmail.com</p>
<p>5 • Ask for the <i>PURSUIT </i>t-shirt for your birthday or Christmas!  Haha… you get me.  Be creative!  There is always something you can do.  :)</p>

I started writing when I was a kid, and songwriting became a hobby when I got my first guitar in high school. Since then, it became a great creative outlet for me to express my emotions through breakups, obstacles, and troubles in life. </p>
<p>I am raising funds to record my 2nd album, which is more faith-based. My songs are maturing as I grow up, and they are geared towards spreading hope and faith in God. </p>
<p>My contributors will help me spread this message of hope to as many people as possible with even the smallest of donations. Recording an album takes a big investment upfront, so when people pre-purchase an album, it takes the weight off the artist and allows songwriters to keep using their gift to help others! </p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>I am raising $6000 to pay for the costs of:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Recording ($6000) - This pays the producer for the time he is spending on recording, creating music tracks, and sound engineering. </li>
<li>Session Musicians ($50-75 per song for each musician)</li>
<li>Studio Time ($1200 for a week)</li>
<li>Travel costs ($300 a week for hotel stay, gas, food, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>The perks to contributing to my project are free albums, T-shirts, merchandise, album credits, house concerts, and being named as Producer for the album! House concerts are very popular in the folk genre, and you get to invite your friends and family for a potluck dinner, while I entertain your guests in your very home! </p> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Your contribution will help us to keep creating music that will spread encouragement and hope to others! The more you support the arts, the more we can use our talents to serve the world at its greatest needs. For emotional support. For clarity and direction. For hope and faith.  For a positive message. We can keep telling our stories in a way that resonates with other people. We can keep making music for the world! </p> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> As an artist, there are many obstacles to succeeding in the music industry. People don't buy music because they can stream it for free. Major record labels don't sign new artists anymore. Top 40 radio stations only play commercial music. It has become more popular to be a DIY indie artist and treat it as a small business. </p>
<p>My plan to overcome these obstacles is not only hard work, but to have the right team behind me. My producers have already gone down the road of being independent artists, and they have paved the way so I can succeed. They live in Nashville, where they meet industry professionals every day and are making the right connections. </p>
<p>In this way, I have a team who can help me plan a music tour and can hire the right radio promotor who can get my music onto stations that are geared towards my genre. I have a manager who has connections with music festivals and radio stations and can guide my career in the direction it needs to go. Having a great team is the key to making it in today's music climate. </p> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>If you're unable to make a monetary contribution, there are other ways you can help: </p> <ul> <li>Share this campaign with as many as your friends as possible! </li> <li>Facebook, Twitter, Instagram... whatever you use! There are share links at the top of this page next to the video. </li>
<li>Prayer. I am a strong believer in the power of prayer, and I need all the prayer I can get for this project. Ask for His wisdom, guidance, and provision for this album. </li> </ul> </div> <p>Thanks so much, and I appreciate any contribution you are able to make! </p><p>God bless! </p><p>Amy</p></div>","Short Summary I am Amy Goloby, a singer songwriter in Houston, TX.

We can keep making music for the world!    Risks & Challenges  As an artist, there are many obstacles to succeeding in the music industry. People don't buy music because they can stream it for free. Major record labels don't sign new artists anymore. Top 40 radio stations only play commercial music. It has become more popular to be a DIY indie artist and treat it as a small business. 
My plan to overcome these obstacles is not only hard work, but to have the right team behind me. My producers have already gone down the road of being independent artists, and they have paved the way so I can succeed. They live in Nashville, where they meet industry professionals every day and are making the right connections. 
In this way, I have a team who can help me plan a music tour and can hire the right radio promotor who can get my music onto stations that are geared towards my genre. I have a manager who has connections with music festivals and radio stations and can guide my career in the direction it needs to go. Having a great team is the key to making it in today's music climate.    Other Ways You Can Help If you're unable to make a monetary contribution, there are other ways you can help:   Share this campaign with as many as your friends as possible!  Facebook, Twitter, Instagram... whatever you use! There are share links at the top of this page next to the video. 
Prayer. I am a strong believer in the power of prayer, and I need all the prayer I can get for this project. Ask for His wisdom, guidance, and provision for this album.    Thanks so much, and I appreciate any contribution you are able to make! God bless! Amy",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

I have always been passionate about creating different things and spent most of my childhood developing characters and stories to populate my own comic books. I was also into video games, not just playing them but imagining my own games, drawing the characters and even creating my very own video game magazines! In retrospect, I believe these have a lot to do with what I am doing with my work right now. Although the drawing eventually evolved into music composition, my ideas and the way I work is still very visual.</p><p> I was originally trained in classical composition and created chamber and orchestral works. One of my orchestral <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/inalbilsel/nilays-dream"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">compositions</a> was even awarded the first prize at a composition contest (Notion International Composition Competition). Eventually, I found my own voice within the electronic music world. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1470149532/xtd1teodbvpqchw1tuye.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Within this newfound expression, I successfully released my <a href=""http://www.inalbilsel.com/#!album/c1j4w"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">debut album</a> in 2009 titled '<i>A New Beginning'</i>. However, with neither the funding or a wide advertising campaign or a label to back it, the album silently disappeared. Yet I was never defeated. I continued to persevere and to keep on  improving myself. For the past couple of years, I have composed and produced many tracks and prepared audio-visual concerts named <i>'<a href=""http://simtape.tumblr.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Tales From The Future</a>' </i>using those tracks. The concerts have increasingly garnered a noticeable amount of interest especially in Nicosia (Cyprus). I believe that I have accumulated enough technical knowledge, artistic vision, purpose, and a definite goal to produce my second album of which I have high expectations. </p><h3> </h3><h3>What is <i>Paradise Lost </i>?</h3><p>Paradise Lost will be a conceptual visual album. At its core, it is a music album inspired by various genres of electronic music including ambient and downtempo electronica. It is also a concept album, meaning that it has a larger purpose and a meaning. Paradise Lost will be the first album of SimEX trilogy, based on a fictional world where people use <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GavFckNwK3Q"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">SimTapes</a> as a new form of simulated experience, a form of entertainment, an escape. The complete story will be experienced throughout the album tracks, visual images in the booklets and just about in every corner of the album. </p><p>Although I am most fluent with the musical expression, I would like to believe that I am an artist that is equally concerned with the visual aspects of a musical work. As well as attempting to produce an ambitious album, I would like to make this a visual album, where as well as experiencing the music the way we normally do, you will also be able to experience it with visual imagery. I am currently in the process of gathering a team of artists to shoot an album-length movie. Each artist will shoot and direct a different portion/track of the album. The movie will be shot using VHS tapes! The look, the feel and the atmosphere of the film will be completely surreal and atmospheric. The visual album will also be experienced in surround sound! So after having made a contribution, imagine one day holding this album in your hand, popping it in your DVD player and experiencing this atmospheric journey through sound and vision...

<p>Well, it’s been 15 studio
CDs, more than 1000 shows around the world and we’re planning some awesome
things for our fans. Despite the sad state of the music
business, Annihilator have never given up and hope we’ve given you some good
music and good times along the way!</p>
<p>Now, we urgently need your help to raise money for touring,
shows, the live acoustic DVD, the mini documentary DVD and the live concert DVD we are planning.
Although we have a very supportive label and touring agency, these ambitious
plans cost a lot more money than any of us have. See the expense
list below and we're sure you'll understand.</p>
<p>In return for your contributions, we’ve come up with some
amazing things to offer you: From Jeff’s custom Chevy Camaro muscle car, to
watching an Annihilator live-streamed rehearsal, hanging out at Jeff’s home and studio, getting some of his guitars, free concert tix for life, AND MORE… See the gallery section for pics of the perks. We
hope you love these killer packages as much as we loved making them!</p>
<p>Obviously, not everyone will be able to afford or will want the car package but hopefully it has pointed you to the Live Rehearsal Stream Package and the others.</p>
<p>Thanks for your time and hopefully your contributions!</p>

<p>We wanted to think of a “Grand Prize” type of perk that would do 2 things:<br/></p>
<p>1) Attract a lot of attention  to this campaign, so
everyone would see all the awesome things we are offering.</p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">2) Give one VERY lucky Annihilator, metal and Camaro fan the ultimate package!  </span></p>
<p>First off, the contributor that gets this <span>package will get Jeff’s very own custom “ANNIHILATOR EDITION”
Chevrolet Camaro SS (2012) packed with

<p>Next, when you come to get your car, you can stay with Jeff at
his house for 2 days/1 night. If you <span>want to jam in
his studio, get some lessons, go for a bike ride with him… or simply just hang
out: this will be a blast!</span></p>
<p>When you leave Jeff’s house, you will also get:</p>
<p></p>      • Jeff’s personal Epiphone <span>“Annihilation” V guitar: Out of production for a few years and is not
available anywhere!</span>
<br/>      • The new <span>Epiphone
“Annihilation II” V guitar from Jeff’s studio stock.</span>
<br/>      • A rare Laboga ""Jeff Waters<span>Signature""

<p>Now if that’s not enough, <span>Jeff and the boys
will give you 2 guest-list tickets/passes to any Annihilator non-festival show
FOR LIFE.</span></p>
MAIN TERMS:
<br/>Jeff’s home, studio, car
and other items in the package are located in Dunrobin, Ontario, Canada (not far from Ottawa). You will be responsible for
getting yourself there at a mutually agreed upon date
&amp; time and taking it all with you.<br/>If, for some reason, you don't wish to come to
Jeff’s, you can arrange, at your own expense, to have it all shipped to you.

paperwork to be sorted out, in order <span>to transfer car
ownership, the contributor and Jeff will sort it out together.

<h3><b>Our Plans &amp; Expenses</b></h3>
<p></p>
Here are the major expenses for our upcoming year, before our next studio
CD. Although we get income from our live shows and a loan from our record company for our upcoming DVD release, these don’t even come close to
covering most of the costs below.
<p></p>• Flights: For example, international flights for 8 band/crew, on just a summer festival tour, can cost around
$35,000. Add to this the flight costs for rehearsals in Canada, touring, one-off shows, acoustic &amp; live DVD shoots and this adds at least $30,000 more.<br/>• Equipment shipping.<br/>• Tour bus, vans, trucking, gas, and related expenses for our upcoming European tour will cost roughly $35,000.<br/>• Hotels, food, taxis, rentals.<br/>• Lawyer, accountant, bookkeeper &amp; work visas.<br/>• Live concert DVD recording &amp; mini documentary: audio engineers,
camera crew, and lights, sound, guitar &amp; drum techs.<br/>• Acoustic DVD: audio engineer, camera crew, techs.<br/>• DVD package artwork, video editing, audio mixing &amp; mastering.</span></span>
</div></span></span></div></div>","Our Campaign
Well, it’s been 15 studio
CDs, more than 1000 shows around the world and we’re planning some awesome
things for our fans. Despite the sad state of the music
business, Annihilator have never given up and hope we’ve given you some good
music and good times along the way!
Now, we urgently need your help to raise money for touring,
shows, the live acoustic DVD, the mini documentary DVD and the live concert DVD we are planning.
Although we have a very supportive label and touring agency, these ambitious
plans cost a lot more money than any of us have. See the expense
list below and we're sure you'll understand.
In return for your contributions, we’ve come up with some
amazing things to offer you: From Jeff’s custom Chevy Camaro muscle car, to
watching an Annihilator live-streamed rehearsal, hanging out at Jeff’s home and studio, getting some of his guitars, free concert tix for life, AND MORE… See the gallery section for pics of the perks. We
hope you love these killer packages as much as we loved making them!
Obviously, not everyone will be able to afford or will want the car package but hopefully it has pointed you to the Live Rehearsal Stream Package and the others.
Thanks for your time and hopefully your contributions!

Exclusive Packages

Remember, everything available here is exclusive to this
campaign!

We think this is going to be one of the coolest packages:

We want  you to join us for a 1 hour live streamed rehearsal in September.

Live from Watersound Studios, ANNIHILATOR will be getting ready for the 2nd European tour for the “SUICIDE SOCIETY” record. Let’s get an army of metal fans watching us working on songs we will play on the next tour!
 There will be 4 rehearsals days in early September; we'll give you a few choices (dates and times) to choose from.
Here we have a high resolution print of the original lyric sheet / songwriters' agreement for the Annihilator classic Alison Hell!
The lyric sheet was signed by Jeff Waters and John Bates, the writers of the song (witnessed by first bassist Dave Scott) in 1986. Jeff will also sign the top right of the document for you, so you know it's an original. It will be mailed to you unfolded.

We wanted to think of a “Grand Prize” type of perk that would do 2 things:
1) Attract a lot of attention  to this campaign, so
everyone would see all the awesome things we are offering.
2) Give one VERY lucky Annihilator, metal and Camaro fan the ultimate package!  
First off, the contributor that gets this package will get Jeff’s very own custom “ANNIHILATOR EDITION”
Chevrolet Camaro SS (2012) packed with
goodies:      • Killer custom-installed audio system from
Cerwin-Vega, including a Kenwood Excelon (DDX891HD Navigation/Receiver              
      • Airaid 251-243 Cold Air Intake      • Magnaflow Performance 15092 exhaust
      • Jet Performance
90160 Pulley set/underdrive pulley set
      • Diablosport Trinity-tuned and have used only 94 Octane fuel
      • Massive & Maximum Performance Pirelli
P Zero 305/35ZR20 (104Y) rear tires
      • American Racing Rims / Sensors The car is 3.5 years old, has never been in an accident and is in fantastic condition. There are 2 scratches and 2 small dents;
pics on request.
Next, when you come to get your car, you can stay with Jeff at
his house for 2 days/1 night. If you want to jam in
his studio, get some lessons, go for a bike ride with him… or simply just hang
out: this will be a blast!
When you leave Jeff’s house, you will also get:
      • Jeff’s personal Epiphone “Annihilation” V guitar: Out of production for a few years and is not
available anywhere!
      • The new Epiphone
“Annihilation II” V guitar from Jeff’s studio stock.
      • A rare Laboga ""Jeff WatersSignature""
guitar amplifier. Only 2 left in Jeff’s collection and you get one!
Now if that’s not enough, Jeff and the boys
will give you 2 guest-list tickets/passes to any Annihilator non-festival show
FOR LIFE.
MAIN TERMS:
Jeff’s home, studio, car
and other items in the package are located in Dunrobin, Ontario, Canada (not far from Ottawa). You will be responsible for
getting yourself there at a mutually agreed upon date
& time and taking it all with you.If, for some reason, you don't wish to come to
Jeff’s, you can arrange, at your own expense, to have it all shipped to you.
As different countries, states and provinces have different
paperwork to be sorted out, in order to transfer car
ownership, the contributor and Jeff will sort it out together.
Additional
details to be discussed.






Simple, yet we hope you can help us with this one!
We have a nice autographed postcard from Jeff & 2 of his Jim Dunlop custom guitar picks!

<h3>What Is Project Prayer Song?</h3>
<p>Hello music lovers!</p>
<p>We are a <a href=""https://projectprayersong.org/meet-team/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">team</a> of like minded individuals who are <i>extraordinarily</i> passionate about music, multimedia, and <strong>making the world a better place. </strong>On January 22nd, 2016, we launched <a href=""http://projectprayersong.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Project Prayer Song</a>, and asked people online to contribute their voices to the choruses of our song. Since then we've received <strong>hundreds</strong> of submissions from across the globe, from countries like the U.S., Canada, Italy, France, Spain and Serbia. We've also been taking our portable studio rig out locally &amp; regionally, recording all sorts of people at public and private recording events, out on the streets... and pretty much anywhere else!</p>
<p>To date, we've recorded over <strong>400 voices! </strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1475430745/dbuwnswik2xgs06coolk.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>

<p> </p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">After nearly a year of investing our own time &amp; money (and also, </span><i style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">a LOT</i><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;""> of blood, sweat and tears) into this project, we're more than confident that we're on the golden path to success.</span><strong style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;""> </strong><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Not only have we seen, firsthand, the joy that this project has brought to the people who have been involved with it thus far, but we've also seen it change them from the inside out. In short, we've </span><strong style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">seen this project</strong><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;""> </span><strong style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">working.</strong></p>
<p>We've also landed <a href=""https://projectprayersong.org/sponsors/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">gear sponsorships</a> with several high end audio companies like Universal Audio, Slate Digital, Antares Tech., and Eventide, who also strongly believe in what we're doing, and who've already provided us with some of the equipment that we needed to get the job done.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1475255805/ajj4iussc6credkzmdp8.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>And so now, we're ready to take this project to the <strong>next level. </strong>But we can't do that without your support!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>So What Is ""The Next Level?""</h3>
<p>We've planned an <a href=""https://projectprayersong.org/on-the-road/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">80 city US tour</a> which kicks off at 'South By Southwest' in Austin next March. The tour will run for about 15 months, and during this time, we'll be recording as many different people, from as many different demographics as we can find. It's super important to us to show diversity, and by traveling around the United States, we're certain we'll find what we're looking for. We're also shooting a full length feature documentary of the entire process.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1475284337/wnfjodn7lkpn2ckglqzb.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>We're also in the beginning stages of developing a smartphone app for iOS and Android, which will be available for free once the tour starts. Basically, this app will allow anyone with a smartphone, earbuds and an internet connection to submit their vocals to the project from anywhere in the world. Woot!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1475595701/mxczsmcbxov3tfi8hmex.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What Is The Impact Of A Project Like This?</h3>
<p>We live in the internet age, and clearly, the internet has connected us in ways we could have never imagined. But at the same time, it seems as if we are more disconnected than ever... on a personal level. We believe that a project like this not only demonstrates the power of what we can accomplish when we put our differences aside and come together for a common cause, but also helps to create exciting opportunities for different people to hang out with one another, united by a common interest. People who may normally have never done something like that before. The possibilities are endless...</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1475287637/ppwazrqtzylbphj2ur82.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>But let's be honest, everyone says that their project is ""going to change the world."" We aren't going to assume that Project Prayer Song will disrupt the very fabric of space and time. Or it might, who knows. What we can promise, though, is an outcome that will plant seeds in the minds of human beings across the globe. Seeds that we believe will flower into something greater than this project's original purpose.</p>
<p>Another major impact of this project, is the fact that half of the proceeds of the sale of the single will be <strong>donated to local charities</strong> we visit on the tour. Yep, you heard that right. Our plan is to stop in various cities along the way, and lend a helping hand to charitable organizations. </p>
<p><i>Personally.</i> </p>
<p>Soup kitchens, homeless shelters, you name it. And, hopefully, in the process, we'll be able to record some of these folk's voices for the project too... along with hearing their personal stories. This has always been an important component to us, and we're very excited to make a real difference in people's lives, if we can.</p>
<p><strong><i>* As soon as the <a href=""https://projectprayersong.org/on-the-road/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">tour schedule</a> develops a little more over the fall/winter of 2016, we will provide a list of charities that we are planning to visit/donate to on our <a href=""http://projectprayersong.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">website</a>. Please be sure to check back with us for updates.</i></strong></p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need.</h3>
<p>In order to accomplish these goals, we need to raise $250,000. Please believe us when we tell you that this amount was the <strong>absolute lowest</strong> that we could whittle the budget down to. And we still had to <strong>cut a lot of corners</strong> to arrive at *that* number.</p>
<p>Now, we know that's a lot of money for most people (it is for us too!), but when you look at it in terms of what we're spending it on, it's actually pretty low...</p>
<p>For instance, for a 4 person team to be on the road for 15 months, it takes more than just an RV and some spare time. We have to eat. At five dollars a meal (@ 3 meals a day), per person, for 4 people, that's $60 a day. Over 15 months, that adds up to $25,200. Then there's fuel, RV parks, phone, internet, equipment costs, app development costs, etc. All these things add up! </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1475253553/nrrlr2s5ibaplzywj2om.png"" src="""" style=""""/></h3>
<p><i>* A four person team is crucial to the success of this tour. Not only are two people not enough in terms of manpower (recording audio, shooting video, editing, social outreach, etc.) but a four person team is also <strong>imperative</strong> for security and safety reasons while traveling to unknown areas of the country.</i></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What We Want To Give You In Return:</h3>
<p>We took a LOT of time and effort to think about the perks for this campaign, because we knew that only giving away T-Shirts and mugs was a bit of a cop out. We wanted to go way beyond that, and give you something special and memorable..</p>
<p>We reached out to <a href=""https://projectprayersong.org/featured-visual-artists/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">cutting edge visual artists</a> from all over the world, and asked them if they’d be interested in contributing their artwork to our project. We had an OVERWHELMINGLY positive response, and since then, we’ve received material from artists like Android Jones, Amanda Sage, Cameron Gray, and a bunch of other amazing individuals who were excited to get involved.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1475255536/wa9iqnkmgnhjoz1f2z9s.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><i>""Galactavangel"" by Android Jones.</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Along with all of this artwork, we’ve also included some of the usual perks like T-shirts, one of a kind posters, laser etched dog tags, and of course digital downloads and physical copies of the song on vinyl, when it’s finished. We even came up with a few fun interactive perks as well, like personal phone calls &amp; videos from the team, and our personal favorite, Jesse cooks you a lasagna when we’re in your town!</p>
<p><b><i>* The reason there are SO MANY perks in this campaign, is because we are offering many of the art pieces on different mediums (print, canvas, metal, etc..) and at various dimensions. We wanted to make sure we gave <u>everyone</u> an opportunity to be able to purchase some of this incredible work!</i></b></p>

<h3>So What Could Go Wrong?</h3>
<p>We've put a lot of time into thinking about this very question, and here are a few hurdles that we've been addressing.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>What happens if you only raise half the money? Do you still go on the tour? </strong>- The short answer to this question would be, yes. Obviously, we'd have to cut the tour down to almost a quarter of the cities we originally wanted to visit, but we still feel like something is better than nothing. That being said, it would make us tremendously sad to not visit all 80 cities, because we know there are <strong>A LOT</strong> of people across the country who would LOVE to be involved. We also feel like the crux of this project, technically speaking, will be the smart phone app. We truly believe that this is a crucial part of the mix, so we're definitely going to invest in that first.</li>
<li>
<strong>How are you going to manage all of those voices if you end up getting hundreds of thousands of submissions? </strong>- Another good question. At this juncture, our plan is to hire the help of an editing team to help us sort through them. It's a big endeavor, we know that. But we think that as this tour progresses, and our visibility among the world increases, finding willing editors may very well be the easiest part of this whole equation. Now, in terms of how we make all those voices fit together... that is an entirely new conundrum. We've already made 400 voices blend seamlessly together. We think that if we continue on the same path, in terms of our method, we'll be fine. Plus, there's some pretty amazing technology out there that can handle the workload.</li>
<li>
<strong>How are you going to respond to the people who get offended at the name ""Prayer Song,"" because your project isn't centered around religion?</strong> - This one comes up a lot. In fact, we've already gotten some hate mail from folks whose feathers were ruffled by our project. We'll just say this... ""Prayer"" means a lot of different things to a lot of different people. To us, prayer means ""an earnest hope or wish,"" as well as ""a petition."" No, seriously, look it up. It's in the dictionary. That being said, this project's intent is to be all inclusive, and to assume that one's definition is better than another... well, that would be just plain silly. </li>

</div></div>","What Is Project Prayer Song?
Hello music lovers!
We are a team of like minded individuals who are extraordinarily passionate about music, multimedia, and making the world a better place. On January 22nd, 2016, we launched Project Prayer Song, and asked people online to contribute their voices to the choruses of our song. Since then we've received hundreds of submissions from across the globe, from countries like the U.S., Canada, Italy, France, Spain and Serbia. We've also been taking our portable studio rig out locally & regionally, recording all sorts of people at public and private recording events, out on the streets... and pretty much anywhere else!
To date, we've recorded over 400 voices! 
 

 
Click Here To Hear A Clip Of The Song!!!
 
After nearly a year of investing our own time & money (and also, a LOT of blood, sweat and tears) into this project, we're more than confident that we're on the golden path to success. Not only have we seen, firsthand, the joy that this project has brought to the people who have been involved with it thus far, but we've also seen it change them from the inside out. In short, we've seen this project working.
We've also landed gear sponsorships with several high end audio companies like Universal Audio, Slate Digital, Antares Tech., and Eventide, who also strongly believe in what we're doing, and who've already provided us with some of the equipment that we needed to get the job done.
 

 
And so now, we're ready to take this project to the next level. But we can't do that without your support!
 
So What Is ""The Next Level?""
We've planned an 80 city US tour which kicks off at 'South By Southwest' in Austin next March. The tour will run for about 15 months, and during this time, we'll be recording as many different people, from as many different demographics as we can find. It's super important to us to show diversity, and by traveling around the United States, we're certain we'll find what we're looking for. We're also shooting a full length feature documentary of the entire process.
 

 
We're also in the beginning stages of developing a smartphone app for iOS and Android, which will be available for free once the tour starts. Basically, this app will allow anyone with a smartphone, earbuds and an internet connection to submit their vocals to the project from anywhere in the world. Woot!

 
 
What Is The Impact Of A Project Like This?
We live in the internet age, and clearly, the internet has connected us in ways we could have never imagined. But at the same time, it seems as if we are more disconnected than ever... on a personal level. We believe that a project like this not only demonstrates the power of what we can accomplish when we put our differences aside and come together for a common cause, but also helps to create exciting opportunities for different people to hang out with one another, united by a common interest. People who may normally have never done something like that before. The possibilities are endless...
 

 
But let's be honest, everyone says that their project is ""going to change the world."" We aren't going to assume that Project Prayer Song will disrupt the very fabric of space and time. Or it might, who knows. What we can promise, though, is an outcome that will plant seeds in the minds of human beings across the globe. Seeds that we believe will flower into something greater than this project's original purpose.
Another major impact of this project, is the fact that half of the proceeds of the sale of the single will be donated to local charities we visit on the tour. Yep, you heard that right. Our plan is to stop in various cities along the way, and lend a helping hand to charitable organizations. 
Personally. 
Soup kitchens, homeless shelters, you name it. And, hopefully, in the process, we'll be able to record some of these folk's voices for the project too... along with hearing their personal stories. This has always been an important component to us, and we're very excited to make a real difference in people's lives, if we can.
* As soon as the tour schedule develops a little more over the fall/winter of 2016, we will provide a list of charities that we are planning to visit/donate to on our website. Please be sure to check back with us for updates.
 

What We Need.
In order to accomplish these goals, we need to raise $250,000. Please believe us when we tell you that this amount was the absolute lowest that we could whittle the budget down to. And we still had to cut a lot of corners to arrive at *that* number.
Now, we know that's a lot of money for most people (it is for us too!), but when you look at it in terms of what we're spending it on, it's actually pretty low...
For instance, for a 4 person team to be on the road for 15 months, it takes more than just an RV and some spare time. We have to eat. At five dollars a meal (@ 3 meals a day), per person, for 4 people, that's $60 a day. Over 15 months, that adds up to $25,200. Then there's fuel, RV parks, phone, internet, equipment costs, app development costs, etc. All these things add up! 
 


* A four person team is crucial to the success of this tour. Not only are two people not enough in terms of manpower (recording audio, shooting video, editing, social outreach, etc.) but a four person team is also imperative for security and safety reasons while traveling to unknown areas of the country.
 
What We Want To Give You In Return:
We took a LOT of time and effort to think about the perks for this campaign, because we knew that only giving away T-Shirts and mugs was a bit of a cop out. We wanted to go way beyond that, and give you something special and memorable..
We reached out to cutting edge visual artists from all over the world, and asked them if they’d be interested in contributing their artwork to our project. We had an OVERWHELMINGLY positive response, and since then, we’ve received material from artists like Android Jones, Amanda Sage, Cameron Gray, and a bunch of other amazing individuals who were excited to get involved.

""Galactavangel"" by Android Jones.
 
Along with all of this artwork, we’ve also included some of the usual perks like T-shirts, one of a kind posters, laser etched dog tags, and of course digital downloads and physical copies of the song on vinyl, when it’s finished. We even came up with a few fun interactive perks as well, like personal phone calls & videos from the team, and our personal favorite, Jesse cooks you a lasagna when we’re in your town!
* The reason there are SO MANY perks in this campaign, is because we are offering many of the art pieces on different mediums (print, canvas, metal, etc..) and at various dimensions. We wanted to make sure we gave everyone an opportunity to be able to purchase some of this incredible work!
 
Behind The Scenes:
Prayer Song is written by Jesse Scott (aka: Summer Channel) and Oriel Poole. 
Jesse Scott (aka: Summer Channel) is a twenty-one year veteran music producer who has released countless original albums and singles, and has written original music with Adam Lambert, Jes, Chrysta Bell, and many others. He’s also remixed artists such as Madonna, Seal, David Bowie, Shiny Toy Guns, Paul Oakenfold, The Crystal Method, Markus Schulz, Delirium, Celldweller, Curve, Johnny Cash, and Frank Sinatra (just to name a few). He’s written music that has appeared in major motion pictures such as Bad Boys II, Tomb Raider, and The Art Of War; television shows like CSI, Arrow and Buffy the Vampire
* See interview with Jesse Scott below:


 

 
Oriel Poole is a newly established vocalist based in Los Angeles, California. Oriel's ethereal vibes are matched by a voice blending compassion, soul, and light. Check her out online at orielpoole.com
 

So What Could Go Wrong?
We've put a lot of time into thinking about this very question, and here are a few hurdles that we've been addressing.


What happens if you only raise half the money? Do you still go on the tour? - The short answer to this question would be, yes. Obviously, we'd have to cut the tour down to almost a quarter of the cities we originally wanted to visit, but we still feel like something is better than nothing. That being said, it would make us tremendously sad to not visit all 80 cities, because we know there are A LOT of people across the country who would LOVE to be involved. We also feel like the crux of this project, technically speaking, will be the smart phone app. We truly believe that this is a crucial part of the mix, so we're definitely going to invest in that first.

How are you going to manage all of those voices if you end up getting hundreds of thousands of submissions? - Another good question. At this juncture, our plan is to hire the help of an editing team to help us sort through them. It's a big endeavor, we know that. But we think that as this tour progresses, and our visibility among the world increases, finding willing editors may very well be the easiest part of this whole equation. Now, in terms of how we make all those voices fit together... that is an entirely new conundrum. We've already made 400 voices blend seamlessly together. We think that if we continue on the same path, in terms of our method, we'll be fine. Plus, there's some pretty amazing technology out there that can handle the workload.

How are you going to respond to the people who get offended at the name ""Prayer Song,"" because your project isn't centered around religion? - This one comes up a lot. In fact, we've already gotten some hate mail from folks whose feathers were ruffled by our project. We'll just say this... ""Prayer"" means a lot of different things to a lot of different people. To us, prayer means ""an earnest hope or wish,"" as well as ""a petition."" No, seriously, look it up. It's in the dictionary. That being said, this project's intent is to be all inclusive, and to assume that one's definition is better than another... well, that would be just plain silly. 

How are you going to manage living in an RV for 15 months? Won't that drive you guys crazy? - Not really. We've whittled all of our earthly possessions down to nothing but the things that fit into a small room. In fact, we've been living in a friend's small room for the last 6 months, in preparation for RV life. When we get the RV, it will be like living in a castle. We can't wait.

 

Can't Help Financially? That's OK! But Read On...
Trust us, we soooooo get it. We're not made of money either, and neither are 99% of most people on earth. (See what we did there?). But, look, this campaign's success isn't entirely dependent on every single person we know contributing in a financial aspect. To be honest, what we really need is for people to spread the word. And we're not talking about Facebook posts. Nope. Statistics show, that Facebook posts about random crowdfunding campaigns have about 1% real world engagement. Yep. Sad isn't it? Why is that?
Because there's simply too much white noise on the internet these days for anyone to care. Because the only thing that Facebook likes are good for, is nothing. That's why. So here's what you can do...
If you LOVE music, if you see the potential in this project like we do, if you want to help us create something that will be nothing short of magical, then please share this project with the people in your network who are in alignment.
And what we mean by ""share"" is, call them. Email them. PERSONALLY. Tell them what Project Prayer Song is about and why you're excited about it. That's how we can all make this work... by making that personal connection. 
Sound familiar? Yeah, exactly. That's what this whole project is about to begin with. And when human beings realize how powerful REAL HUMAN CONNECTIONS are, we'll see the world around us transform in a way that we can't possibly imagine.
Seriously. 
Now go be awesome. We believe in you.

<blockquote><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">“We were....watching [concert] videos on Youtube…[including] Brand New covering Modest Mouse’s Trailer Trash. Jesse Lacey started off the video by talking about how it’s an honor to play this song and how much he loves and respects the music that they make.

We have something special.”</span></blockquote>

We created VFAC with these local artists in mind, while also contemplating how to open up the conversation of music and charity on a national level, engaging bands from all over the country.</p>

<p><span>For our official launch campaign we've partnered with VH1 Save The Music Foundation, and will be donating half of the proceeds towards supporting music education programs across the US.</span></p>In the future we plan to continue recording with artists that want to shed light on important social, political, and other causes of their choice. <p></p>

<p><span>Vinyl For A Cause’s model allows for everyone to win. Not only are we helping to provide fans with really awesome limited vinyl, but we’re also giving artists a platform to gain national exposure and the opportunity to promote good and raise awareness for different causes.</span></p>
<p><span>We’ve enjoyed an exciting and productive year of pushing the VFAC brand out into the world. We have connected and formed lasting relationships with talented musicians and artists, as well as many other partners along the way. With your support, we will be able to launch a wide-reaching campaign. Fostering these influential relationships and further equating music with giving back to the community, all the while planning future releases with interested, like-minded artists.

</div></div>","Story & Team


Vinyl For A Cause (VFAC) is a start-up record label based around the idea that music can be a driver for charitable good. We work with bands who cover and record each other's music on sides A and B of a 7-inch, limited edition vinyl record. Together, we then select a charity whose use most resonates with each set of bands and donate a percentage of the proceeds to the selected organization.


We are Adam Victorn and Charlie Greengoss, Co-Founders/Co-Owners of VFAC. We have worked for radio stations, concert venues, sports stadiums, ad agencies, and now the beloved wax circle. We’ve rooted Vinyl For A Cause in charity, passion, music, and the community. These collective professional experiences, combined with our enthusiasm towards music, lead us to considering ways that we can connect music with giving back to the community.
The spark that ignited Vinyl For A Cause took place on an routine night of spinning records and watching concert videos together. 
“We were....watching [concert] videos on Youtube…[including] Brand New covering Modest Mouse’s Trailer Trash. Jesse Lacey started off the video by talking about how it’s an honor to play this song and how much he loves and respects the music that they make. This really resonated with us...how cool the idea of musicians covering each other’s music really is…to get 2 bands together, that really respect and cherish each other’s music, and let them choose 1 or 2 songs to record straight to vinyl.” We each, independently thought, “we can do something with this together. We have something special.”

We're proud to have called Chicago home for the past 27 years, and are big proponents of the music scene here. That alone made it really easy to start off in the right direction, as there are a tremendous number of artists here who continue to inspire us year after year. We created VFAC with these local artists in mind, while also contemplating how to open up the conversation of music and charity on a national level, engaging bands from all over the country.




For our official launch campaign we've partnered with VH1 Save The Music Foundation, and will be donating half of the proceeds towards supporting music education programs across the US.In the future we plan to continue recording with artists that want to shed light on important social, political, and other causes of their choice. 

Impact
Vinyl For A Cause’s model allows for everyone to win. Not only are we helping to provide fans with really awesome limited vinyl, but we’re also giving artists a platform to gain national exposure and the opportunity to promote good and raise awareness for different causes.
We’ve enjoyed an exciting and productive year of pushing the VFAC brand out into the world. We have connected and formed lasting relationships with talented musicians and artists, as well as many other partners along the way. With your support, we will be able to launch a wide-reaching campaign. Fostering these influential relationships and further equating music with giving back to the community, all the while planning future releases with interested, like-minded artists. It is our hope that this campaign expands far beyond Chicago and that the VFAC mission statement resonates with artists of all styles and genres.

Railway Gamblers originated on the southside of Chicago in March 2014. Individually, the four members had been very active in the local music scene and came together with primary songwriter, Brendan Folliard, who sought out a band to contribute to his extensive catalog of original songs. 
Lead guitarist, Matt Fricks, and drummer/vocalist, Sean Wilmsen, had played music for over six years together prior to the formation of Railway Gamblers and the two were enlisted to contribute their respective roles. With the need for a bassist, Joe Sexton was recruited to serve as the backbone for the group's material.  http://www.railwaygamblers.com/

Every single thing really does make a difference, and we do plan to continue finding ways to make a difference for these charities even after this record comes out. Vinyl For A Cause and music for charity – it can’t stop. Society needs it.” - Matt Fricks, Railway Gamblers


The Leadfoot Band founded themselves on bluegrass roots over a decade ago in the concrete jungle and bluegrass mecca of the southside of Chicago, The Leadfoot Band have branched out in all directions from there. Incorporating their love of bluegrass with their early urban influences of rock , funk and everything in between, the evolution of the band is hard to place. Fans have said Leadfoot is just hard driving bluegrass, some say they are rock infused jamgrass, or even a bastard child of Bill Monroe meets Metallica. The online music site JamGrass.net even says The Leadfoot Band is ""A mix between Edward Sharpe and The Magnetic Zeros and Greensky Bluegrass."" http://www.theleadfootband.com/

<h3>Hey Folks...</h3>
</div><p>If you've known me any days between 1976 and Today, there's a <i>verrrrry</i> good chance that I've played a guitar and sang some of my songs for you. Around a <i>Campfire</i>, in a <i>Club</i>, on your <i>Couch</i>, in your <i>Kitchen </i>or maybe on your <i>Porch</i>, on the <i>Big Stage</i> at a <i>Major Summer Music Fest</i> or <i>countless other spots</i> where we shared some music and created those memories together... </p><p>While many of you shared during very visible performances along my creative path, what you may not know is that for <i>all </i>of these years, even during chapters when I've taken a break from playing LIVE shows, I have <i>n e v e r</i> stopped writing the songs that flow out of me consistently over all the years...Of <i>ANY</i> of the creative aspects of my life, Singer/Songwriter is the <i>core of my passion</i> and how I most identify myself, <i>to myself.</i></p><p>As of now, my catalog of Original Songs I've written totals over 100...with more coming as they do...non-stop, <i>always</i>. The style falls under an <i>Americana</i> label, and yet even that label consists of a varied range of styles...<i>SO </i>many Artists have influenced me over the years, too many to ever list...Yet, I <i>could</i> offer up influences ranging way back from <i>James Taylor, Cat Stevens, Jim Croce,The Eagles</i>, <i>America,</i> <i>Early Elton</i>,<i>CSN &amp;</i> <i>Neil Young</i>, <i>Springsteen, Willie, Lyle Lovett, Michelle Shocked, Ray LaMontagne, Jason Isbel, Patty Griffin, Sheryl </i><i> Crow, Radney Foster, Hal Ketchum, Jimmy Buffet, Miranda Lambert, Kacey Musgraves, Bruce Robison, Teddy </i><i>Thompson</i>, <i>Robert Earl Keen, Steve Earl, Lucinda Williams, Dwight Yoakum...get it? </i></p><p><i>All </i>of these folks and<i> so </i>many more, yet <i>none</i> of them <i>quite exactly</i>....</p><p>Because of course, it's<i> me</i>....the songs sound, like,<i> me. </i><br/>If you're a fan of <i>any</i> of the above Artists, there's a chance we'd connect on my songs <i>too</i>. </p><p>And so, with my days of playing shows on the <i>Big Stages</i> to the<i> Big Crowds</i> being long behind me, I just assumed I was <i>done</i>. That train had left along with my dark hair long ago. <i>Done</i> with recording, <i>done</i> with ALL of it. Just. <i>Done</i>...Let the <i>Young Guns</i>, or, The <i>Old Guns</i> like Willie, carry on with the torch....<i>riiiight?</i></p><p><i>Wrong.</i></p><p>Because....I finally realized....my torch isn't goin' out! <br/>You know how a Campfire can be <i>just about out,</i> just <i>glowing embers</i>, and you just fan the coals a a <i>little bit</i> and it erupts back into a full-on blaze? yeah, <i>t h a t.</i></p><p>I have a life-time body of work in my song catalog, and I need to start making records and sharing my music with the world...If I recorded every song in my catalog starting today, I'd have 10-12 complete Records/CD of my original songs ready to go, not to mention the new songs that keep coming... </p><p>I recently met with producer <i>Robert Mokry</i>, who I had recorded what I recalled as a few ""demo"" songs way back in 2001...I told him I thought I wanted to start recording a CD...Something simple...<i> BigDougUnplugged</i> kinda thing...He suggested I come to Austin to see his new studio and listen to some songs he had been working on...1st song: the band kicks in, I really dug the whole sound and I say to him...<i>""Wow, sounds cool, who is this?""</i>....and then, in a moment that literally changed my life from now until forever, he looks at me incredulously as says, ""Who <i>IS</i> this? It's <i>YOU!""</i></p><p>He <i>then</i> continued to showcase these songs, <i>MY</i> songs, a <i>few</i> of which I had <strong><i>completely forgotten I had ever even wrote!</i></strong> <i>(...</i>let alone <i>recorded!</i>)  How can I <i>possibly</i> convey the feeling, of hearing a song that sounds vaguely familiar, like, you've already heard it on the radio maybe, only to realize when the vocals kick in, that it's <i>YOU singing? </i>A song <i>YOU WROTE</i> and completely forgot about? <i>And</i> there were more to follow...It was mind blowing...and for me, <i>life changing</i>.</p><p>So as it turns out, I'm <i>not </i>done..I'm not <i>done at all</i>...I'm just getting <i>started</i> in fact...</p><p>And I will continue to write and record better and better songs the older I get and the more Life I've lived with more stories to tell...That's the Plan. I hope you'll take a listen to what I have to share for now, with open ears to how it will all sound when it is finished and fully produced with the full Studio Band...</p><p>The landscape of music making has changed over the years, ""signing big record deals"" and spending $100,000+ on recording a record are no longer the norm...Self-produced, low-budget-crowd-funded sources such as this Indiegogo site are the way that many Artists world-wide are getting their projects finished and to an audience around the world...<i>This</i> is where this website comes in and why I am asking for your support and I am hoping you will SHARE with your circle.</p><p>We will be making this record for under $10,000...for 13 songs-pressed and delivered by Nov.-Dec...That budget includes a highly skilled Producer/Studio Hourly Rental/Top TX Studio Musicians/Fully pressed &amp; packaged CD for your listening pleasure. </p><p>A <i>top-level record, at a basement bargain budget</i>.

We are grateful and excited to share our 1st EP with you, featuring 7 songs that are guaranteed to make your body groove, lift your vibes and expand your mind as we take you on a multi-cultural journey.</p><p>Isistren is a reggae band from Austin, TX who has been playing music since 2003.  That's  over 13+ years of growing as musicians, songwriters as well as friends and family.  It has been a long road getting to the studio, refining our sound, experiencing changes in our band and staying focused on our goal.</p><p>Every woman in the band is a mother, spouse, comforter, nurturer and glue for her family.  Coming together weekly to practice and play live shows, in addition to working full time has been a juggling act for all of us.  We call it our Livity, our way of life. What ties us all together is the music we play.</p><p>Isistren wants to show that you can hold a collective dream together and accomplish something concrete and meaningful. We believe in the power of music to heal, change the world and lift up the vibrations.  We are so grateful for this opportunity to share this with you now!</p><p>Isistren has been in the studio weekly since October 2015 recording this 7-song EP.  Our total costs up to date have been over $3000.00.  We have been self-funding this project through our own financial means, live gigs and merchandise sales.  Did we mention sweatshop labor and hard-work in our kitchens?</p><p>Isistren's goal is simple: to finalize the 4 songs that we currently have and to pay for the final recordings, mixing  and mastering.

We are grateful and excited to share our 1st EP with you, featuring 7 songs that are guaranteed to make your body groove, lift your vibes and expand your mind as we take you on a multi-cultural journey.Isistren is a reggae band from Austin, TX who has been playing music since 2003.  That's  over 13+ years of growing as musicians, songwriters as well as friends and family.  It has been a long road getting to the studio, refining our sound, experiencing changes in our band and staying focused on our goal.Every woman in the band is a mother, spouse, comforter, nurturer and glue for her family.  Coming together weekly to practice and play live shows, in addition to working full time has been a juggling act for all of us.  We call it our Livity, our way of life. What ties us all together is the music we play.Isistren wants to show that you can hold a collective dream together and accomplish something concrete and meaningful. We believe in the power of music to heal, change the world and lift up the vibrations.  We are so grateful for this opportunity to share this with you now!Isistren has been in the studio weekly since October 2015 recording this 7-song EP.  Our total costs up to date have been over $3000.00.  We have been self-funding this project through our own financial means, live gigs and merchandise sales.  Did we mention sweatshop labor and hard-work in our kitchens?Isistren's goal is simple: to finalize the 4 songs that we currently have and to pay for the final recordings, mixing  and mastering. This process will take another 2 months which will cost $1500.00.  Our Indigogo goal is to reach this amount by November 1, 2016 so that we can release our EP on November 19, 2016 at Flamingo Cantina, Austin's premiere reggae club.We currently have 3 of these 7 songs released and available to the public.  By completing these 4 songs, we will be able to get all 7 songs into an EP that can truly showcase Isistren's talents and work. Thank you so very much for donating to our cause!

<p>I have been fortunate enough to have made a living from music for four decades now and that has only been possible because of the support of you the public.  It is something that I have never taken for granted and now in these times when community crowd sourcing is so vital for independent artists such as my self it is appreciated all the more.  I feel that this latest album has the potential to be my little masterpiece.  The songs are all written and are now crying out to be committed to tape.  The experience of recording in Prague while on tour there was so very inspiring to me and I long to return in order to carry on and see the project through to completion.  A couple of tracks have already been recorded elsewhere, namely LA and also one track in Berlin.  The latter being a collaboration with the ridiculously talented Anton Newcomb from The Brian Jones Town Massacre and Asia Argento who is possessed of probably the sexiest voice on the planet!  Still we have a ways to go and the beautiful city of Prague is calling!  The funds recieved via this campaign will go towards the studio costs, musicians fees, hotel, flights and possible a few bottles of the excellent local beer!</p>
<p>The perks on offer here include some rare and unique items such as the pinstriped suit that I wore on stage in the days when I was a very skinny lad indeed!  There is also a chance to actually fly to Prague and be a fly on the wall during one of the sessions!  Also up for grabs here is the actual X-Ray photograph (signed) that was taken of my injured hand.  This was incurred in the Prague studio.  Fortunately I had recorded all of my parts and was being interviewed by a local radio station when the incident happened.  I was simply gesticulating in a rather theatrical manner as I told a story and SNAP! Something drastic happened to the middle finger of my right hand.  It was excruciating and I very reluctantly had to cancel the second of my shows in Prague that evening.  My next port of call was Bucharest and I spent my initial three hours in that fair city in the urgent care ward of the local hospital.  There were no broken bones but it was a pretty severe case of ‘trigger finger’ (damaged tendon)  Apparently it is a common condition amongst musicians and results from ‘repetitive action’.  I am on the mend now thankfully.  I know that I have many loyal supporters out there who come back time and time again to help with these creative endeavors so please believe me when I say that your ‘repetitive action’ of making a pledge will not go unappreciated!  Please feel free to help spread the word regarding this campaign and post liberally on the web.  You are all part of this dream!</p>

<p><strong>What is The Carriage?</strong></p>
<p>Hello and thank you for visiting my campaign! My name is Tal Katsir and I’m a singer, pianist and composer who decided she is going to make her dream a reality and build ""The Carriage"" - A Traveling Musical Stage! </p>
<p><strong>How is it going to happen?</strong></p>
<p>Equipped with amplification and lights, and decorated in a medieval style, ""The Carriage"" is a transformed pickup truck with its open cargo functioning as a stage. The flexibility and light setup of The Carriage will enable spontaneity, authenticity, and rare musical moments. I hope to bring my music to places ""outside of the box"", I hope to make friendships and to make music live, fun, and real with all I have, my heart and soul.</p>
<p><strong>First Journey?</strong></p>
<p>The first journey of The Carriage will be a tour across the US, visiting 15 states in 3 months showcasing “Self Help” - my newly released solo album. I will travel from the busiest city centers to small quiet towns, I hope to perform on a mountain, in the forest, maybe at a desert, I will sing 2 shows every day and camp during the nights.</p>
<p><strong>What does it take?</strong></p>
<p>A second-hand pickup truck (The open cargo area is the stage)</p>
<p>An amp with 2 portable power banks</p>
<p>A keyboard and a mic (Which I already have yey!)</p>
<p>Light stand</p>
<p>Car paint and a bubble machine</p>
<p><strong>Where are you?</strong></p>
<p>The 3 months journey of The Carriage and me will be filmed and documented throughout so you can follow all our adventures, struggles and triumphs. The Carriage's supporters will also receive some truly wonderful perks! So - If you feel like me, that The Carriage is something that can greatly benefit the world and our music in it, please take part in this crazy beautiful project and I promise - The Carriage Will Come To You Too!</p>

<h3>Hello!</h3>
<p>My name is Sylvia Rose Novak. I'm an Americana artist. And I am trying to release my third full-length record in the best possible way.</p>
<p>There are a lot of things that nobody tells you when you decide to become a musician. Especially things about the recording and release process. After my first two projects, I discovered that album releases need to be carefully planned. I also discovered that this careful planning costs much more than throwing the record out to the world and hoping that it is well-liked.</p>
<p>Someone Else's War is the album I have been trying to make since I wrote my first song five years ago. It is finally, truly, my voice. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>Here's the thing, I want to bring you amazing gear and an amazing album, but that costs money. That's where you come in!</p>
<p>This album is releasing on a very very limited run of CDs, on vinyl, and digitally. Vinyl is expensive to purchase because it is expensive to produce.</p>
<p>Also, I still need to finish paying for the mixing and mastering of the album before it can be released. I have the most patient and brilliant engineer who has already donated his time and talent to make this my best project to-date. </p>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>Depending on the amount of your donation, you'll receive various 100% exclusive perks. Special edition vinyl, limited run CDs, badass t-shirts, house concerts, and more!</p>
<p>And, if you donate over $300, you'll be automatically entered for a chance to receive a signed electric violin!</p>
</div><div><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3></div><div><p>Even if you can't contribute, please spread the word! My first two albums are available all over the internet. Like my facebook page. Keep up with me on social media. Come see us live. Every little bit of attention helps.</p></div></div>","Hello!

I hope you will dive in and find some treasures that will excite and inspire you, and most of all I hope that together we can make this happen and bring this new wave of healing into the world.

<li>Be the first to receive a <strong>CD </strong>with a stunning sleeve designed using Francesca's beautiful artwork, signed with all my love, or a <strong>digital download</strong> if you prefer;</li>
<li>Choose from <strong>five exquisite framed prints</strong> - illustrated reflections of the songs - by Francesca Booth;</li>
<li>
<strong>Lyrics and chords</strong> to any of my songs for you to learn, with some extra teaching if wanted;</li>
<li>Opportunities to <strong>work with me</strong> 1-1 or as part of a gathering out in nature to receive personalised healing mantras and sound healing, learn sacred songs, and explore and develop your relationship with your own voice and creativity;</li>
<li>Join me and my new band for a wonderful <strong>launch party</strong> to celebrate the big day, with a live rendition of the whole album including no less than FOUR part harmonies (anyone who knows me well will know that harmonies are my thing so this is very exciting for me!).</li>
</ul><p>So please see what inspires you! Contributions are a minimum guideline so please give whatever you want. Please get in touch if you want to discuss your own tailor made option.</p><p> </p><p><i>If you want more juice... read on!</i></p><h3>The Creation Story</h3><p>Creation features one of my earliest songs, ‘Baba Yaga’, which came to me in the midst of writing my lullabies and was an important sign of things to come. Baba Yaga is a fierce archetype of death and transformation and although in the song I am calling to her, in many ways it has always been her calling to me.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>""Send your plough o'er the bones of the dead<br/>And let the ground renew the skin that you shed...""</i><br/>Baba Yaga, Creation</p><p>Baba Yaga called in the death of the 'me' that identified as a sweet gentle soul that didn't want to get things wrong or ruffle anybody up the wrong way. Out of the ashes of Baba Yaga's fire is emerging a woman so committed to speaking her own truth that ruffling feathers becomes inevitable; a woman that no longer wants to apologise for who she is and what she feels; a woman beginning to feel secure enough in her self-worth to follow the call of her heart even if it means being judged; a woman who is beginning to love and accept herself in all her perfect imperfection.</p><p>I could feel Baba Yaga brewing within me for months, and once finally born into song, I found it utterly terrifying to play for at least two years! It expresses something of my spirit that I hadn't consciously shown to anyone before. However as she began to live through me again, she breathed a new power into my life and my song-writing. In retrospect I see that she needed her own soul family of songs to live amongst.</p><h3>The Songs:</h3><ul>
<li>'Baba Yaga' - The album's big mama!<br/> </li>
<li>'Excalibur' - My call for courage... Calling on the divine masculine sword of light to cut through and illuminate anything in my perception that is not truth, and pry away the grasping, clawing fear that I needed to hide my heart's expression to retain the approval of others;<br/> </li>
<li>'Call to Love' arrived when I received my spiritual name from Great Spirit: 'Mbilou', the Eagle. This name is my inner compass that guides me towards my true nature as a leader and visionary;<br/> </li>
<li>'Forge &amp; Flow' celebrates our connection with Gaia and the elements;<br/> </li>
<li>'Open Your Heart' reminds us that EVERYTHING is born out of love, even our most terrible and violent shadows... because love is all there is;<br/> </li>
<li>'I Will Break' was born one sunny day in my garden in a spirit of playful and childlike resilience, reminding us that every time we break we simply dissolve into the sea of love where we reclaim our divine power;<br/> </li>
<li>'Her Calling' reminds us of the spark of life that moves in all things, reclaiming a joyous devotion for the ancient creator Goddess archetype;<br/> </li>
<li>'These Loving Arms', 'I Am', 'Dissolving' and 'Red White &amp; Black' are deep prayers for our collective remembering;<br/> </li>
<li>and 'New Dawn' is my hope filled vision of a future lived in community.</li>
</ul><p>This album has grown out of a journey of deep personal transformation and awakening, through a profoundly life-changing relationship and into the first stage of its excruciating break up. As opposed to the more subtle and maternal reflections of my lullabies, they are songs that answer Baba Yaga's call for the wilder Shakti energies and powerful masculine forces to take their places in my life, and to embrace my path as a role model for living in the heart.<br/> </p><h3>The Invitation</h3><p>These songs are calling us all to wake up, stand together in our power, let go of our shame, and see the hidden shadows at work in our lives, accepting them for their gifts. They invite our gentle compassion and soft intimacy to dance with our fierce independence in the uncompromising light of truth. They remind us that we are perfect, whole and inextricably linked to the great web of life.</p><p>This album is a fierce cry from the depths of my heart to yours - join me! Let us sing and dance wildly together and surrender ourselves to the eternally renewing energy of Creation.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><br/><i>A force with Nature, Ruth deserves a global platform so that<br/>the rest of the planet can heal through her unique offerings.” </i><br/>(Steve Lee, Glastonbury FM )</p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><p>With love, hope and lots and lots of gratitude,</p><p>Ruth x</p><p>--<br/><i>FYI If I don't reach the full amount, I do still get the money and I will use what I have to get as much done as I can.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Mary Katherine Murphy! I am a hard working, God loving mom with a story to tell. I have been working in the entertainment industry as an actress, model, musician, and writer. I need help to complete my second musical project in attempts to bring more creative gifts to the table. I have a heart for the goodness of creation and to help the world heal through my tunes.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need five thousand dollars to bring Clearwater Creek to fruition. We plan to take this effort to further levels of creativity and have many other projects in mind. Any contributors will be along for this exciting project in attempts to bring it further into film and television and musical pleasure. I am a fun entertainer and love pleIsng my listeners with my hard earned life work in bringing many hardships into creative healing through beauty and love and forgiveness. Many bad things can be turned around into good, with our loving Creator’s help, and I have attempted to do this successfully through my art. We will publicly acknowledge any investors and provide ones who’s give us, at least, 5k residual points in our revenue.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I have had local success and response to my music in performances and radio play. </p>
<p>In overcoming many obstacles through life, I have turned my personal experiences into heavenly opportunities to heal the planet through beautiful art. </p>
<p>I also love to use humor and light in all pains and tribulations, in order to help others cope with adult life problems. I intend to use all of my art for a snowball effort to heal the planet. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As in all creative endeavors in this wild industry, there comes along risks. I have a machine of individuals working to help find solutions for all involved to complete, and find success, in this particular project, along with any further ones to come. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>You can still help us by sharing this campaign with others and coming to my shows!</p>

My name is Mary Katherine Murphy! I am a hard working, God loving mom with a story to tell. I have been working in the entertainment industry as an actress, model, musician, and writer. I need help to complete my second musical project in attempts to bring more creative gifts to the table. I have a heart for the goodness of creation and to help the world heal through my tunes.

What We Need & What You Get
We need five thousand dollars to bring Clearwater Creek to fruition. We plan to take this effort to further levels of creativity and have many other projects in mind. Any contributors will be along for this exciting project in attempts to bring it further into film and television and musical pleasure. I am a fun entertainer and love pleIsng my listeners with my hard earned life work in bringing many hardships into creative healing through beauty and love and forgiveness. Many bad things can be turned around into good, with our loving Creator’s help, and I have attempted to do this successfully through my art. We will publicly acknowledge any investors and provide ones who’s give us, at least, 5k residual points in our revenue.

The Impact
I have had local success and response to my music in performances and radio play. 
In overcoming many obstacles through life, I have turned my personal experiences into heavenly opportunities to heal the planet through beautiful art. 
I also love to use humor and light in all pains and tribulations, in order to help others cope with adult life problems. I intend to use all of my art for a snowball effort to heal the planet. 

Risks & Challenges
As in all creative endeavors in this wild industry, there comes along risks. I have a machine of individuals working to help find solutions for all involved to complete, and find success, in this particular project, along with any further ones to come. 

Other Ways You Can Help
You can still help us by sharing this campaign with others and coming to my shows!
And, always speaking positively about people who are trying to bring true light and integrity and authenticity to the world, as you honor those who truly do so themselves.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3><strong>Welcome to Fran &amp; Flora's Indiegogo campaign! Here you can find out more about us, our project and how you can help us make it happen.</strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><u>Our Story</u></strong></p>
<p>We are a violin and cello duo playing repertoire learnt on our many studies and adventures across Eastern Europe. We have been performing this music around the UK to captive audiences and great acclaim, but have yet to release any recorded material.</p>
<p>This is about to change!</p>
<p>It's been 3 years in the making and soon you'll be able to take us home with you in the form of a CD or download. </p>
<p>With your help we can raise enough funds to finish this long-awaited recording project.</p>
<p><u><strong>How you can help us</strong></u></p>
<p>By signing up to a 'perk' (look right) you will enable us to pre-fund some of our production, printing, promotional costs and session fees. We're offering downloads, signed CDs, instrumental lessons, private concerts and an invitation to a soiree in a secret location.</p>
<p>Any contribution, however big or small, will be hugely appreciated, and if you can't donate any money right now but still wish to be help you can forward our campaign to anyone who you think would be interested in helping fund the project. </p>
<p><strong><u>What's on the album?</u></strong></p>
<p>This project is a collaboration between us (Fran &amp; Flora) and producer Sam Beste (check out his amazing band, Hejira). We are recording some of our favourite tunes and songs from the Klezmer, Romanian, Transylvanian, Roma and Armenian traditions - including Morris Rosenfeld's 'Mayn Rue Platz' and Josef Solinski's 'Romanian Fantasies' - as well as some original compositions inspired by our collaboration with Sam and the eclectic sound worlds we have immersed ourselves in. We have also invited our super-talented friends, Simon Roth (percussion) and Linde Timmermans (violin) to join us on a couple of tracks. It's quite an adventure creating an innovative studio album with traditional material. We want to do more than just record our live set, so we are incorporating electronics and improvisation into the tunes, developing our sound and creating a unique product.</p>
<p><strong><u>Thank you!</u></strong></p>
<p>Thank you so much for supporting us with the costs of recording, producing, printing and launching the album. We look forward to sending you our finished record, seeing you at our upcoming shows, and delivering to you the perks you’ve chosen.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi! My name is Hargo Khalsa. I'm a singer/songwriter, musician and record producer. I started in music playing guitar and singing with my dad in the Sikh temple in Eugene, OR where I grew up. I wrote my first song at 8 y/o, my life long love for music beginning with the first two chords of Buffalo Springfield's 60s anthem For What It's Worth. Music has taken me all over the world, making records in England, New York, and producing over 16 albums.</p>
<p>Making music is my heart and soul. It's the place where I find connection to source, to myself, to power, to healing, to love, to raw emotion. In the last 6 years I've gone through more change than any other time in my life. My family fell apart, my band unraveled, I left home, lost my passion, moved to LA, went to Burning Man, left a tribe, found a new one, fell in love, moved to Joshua Tree, went through the fire, and came out the other side.</p>
<p>These songs are a testimony to that beautiful &amp; challenging journey.., and I want to make this record as a sonic companion to anyone who who has gone - or is going - through huge shifts in their life. I'm so excited to mix some new musical elements into this album as well: Tribal Percussion, Gospel Singers, Electronic Beats, Organic Ambience, and whatever other ""beautiful accidents"" happen in the moment! Making music is a huge challenge and it truly takes PATRONS to do it in the Aquarian Age. That's why I want to include YOU in this process and I hope that YOU will join me! Thank you for your consideration :)</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I know people out there are going through major changes and searching for their path. I truly believe that the answers are within us. Our creative potential is unlimited and our destinies are in our own hands. But it takes a tribe to help us climb the mountain and realize our wildest dreams. This music is meant to be a constant friend and companion to anyone on that path. My vision is to see EVERYONE's dreams and visions come to fruition and be at the forefront of their lives. This album is intended to help us all to take bold and significant steps in that direction. Let's go on this journey together!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Clint Jun is a talented and dedicated singer who brings his heart and soul to his music. He was in the top 12 of American idol season 10, and has been featured in movie soundtracks, including ‘The Room’. His new song, “Her Body,” is a sexy and sultry 80s throwback in the vein of Prince and Michael Jackson - a sure fire hit that will take him to the next level. It deserves a music video to help get it there, so we’re partnering with <a href=""http://www.nevernotchillin.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Never Not Chillin Productions</a> to make this video come to life. By contributing to this campaign, you will help us produce a high production value music video that matches the vibe of the song and will help give people a new platform to experience Clint’s voice. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Calling in as many favors as possible, we still need money for film equipment, such as cameras and lights, production design, locations and wardrobe so we can create a stylistic 80s feel that brings a new dimension to the song. We also have to pay everyone who works on set for their time, commitment, and talent. Our budget will go directly to the dancers and actors who will bring the song to life and the film crew who will make sure they look amazing on camera.</p>
<p>We have some awesome perks. You can get a download of the song, the amazing and illustrious Clint will serenade you for your birthday, or you can even a get an invite to the wrap party to celebrate the completion of the video!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Even if we don't reach our goal, we believe in this video and will put all we have into its production. So many people are donating their time, and our budget will ensure that the folks who stay long hours and work hard are compensated for their time. </p>
<p>The song evokes some of the best eras of music, and reminds us of what music can truly be. Clint is a genuine artist whose been working diligently on his craft and been present in this industry for some time. Fans are currently enjoying his latest digital release, “Sayonara,” which was selected for a radio promotion campaign taking place in the United Kingdom. We want the video for his new song “Her Body” to take him to the next level so even more people locally and globally can experience Clint for the amazing artist he is!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>To handle the risks that come with all low budget productions, we have allocated ourselves ample time in all stages of production to ensure a smooth and easy experience and a high quality finished product. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Please tell your friends, families, and coworkers about this campaign, and share it to your social media. Follow Clint on Instagram, Spotify, and Facebook to keep updated!</p>

What We Need & What You Get
Calling in as many favors as possible, we still need money for film equipment, such as cameras and lights, production design, locations and wardrobe so we can create a stylistic 80s feel that brings a new dimension to the song. We also have to pay everyone who works on set for their time, commitment, and talent. Our budget will go directly to the dancers and actors who will bring the song to life and the film crew who will make sure they look amazing on camera.
We have some awesome perks. You can get a download of the song, the amazing and illustrious Clint will serenade you for your birthday, or you can even a get an invite to the wrap party to celebrate the completion of the video!

The Impact
Even if we don't reach our goal, we believe in this video and will put all we have into its production. So many people are donating their time, and our budget will ensure that the folks who stay long hours and work hard are compensated for their time. 
The song evokes some of the best eras of music, and reminds us of what music can truly be. Clint is a genuine artist whose been working diligently on his craft and been present in this industry for some time. Fans are currently enjoying his latest digital release, “Sayonara,” which was selected for a radio promotion campaign taking place in the United Kingdom. We want the video for his new song “Her Body” to take him to the next level so even more people locally and globally can experience Clint for the amazing artist he is!

Risks & Challenges
To handle the risks that come with all low budget productions, we have allocated ourselves ample time in all stages of production to ensure a smooth and easy experience and a high quality finished product.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I've been writing songs, making records and playing gigs all over the country for several years.  I made three albums for small labels and got some college radio airplay (most notably for the song ""In The City"").   For my fourth album, I raised the funds for the production and manufacturing costs by crowd sourcing and I had great success with it.  I was able to make my finest collection of songs with complete artistic control and not come out in debt to a label.  </p>
<p>With each album, I keep trying to up the stakes on the songwriting craft, the production and the quality of the performances.  I try to make albums you can return to over and over again, songs you can take with you.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We're looking to raise $20,000 to pay for the production of this album and to pay for costs of digital mastering, design and manufacturing of the album for digital download, CD and Vinyl record.   Any additional money made over the target amount will be used to pay for the cost of producing videos for songs from the new album.</p>
<p>With a pledge at the starting level you can pre-order your own download, CD or vinyl LP copy of the new album.  There are many more cool incentive perks for pledges of different levels.  You can have singed lyrics sheets or posters.  I will record a studio version of the cover song of your choice.  You can even pledge and order a concert in your home for you and your friends. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Like all of the musicians I love best, I make music because I love making music.  I  work hard at making my songs, my records and my shows fun, well crafted and easy to listen to.  If you'd like to hear this music, pledge what you can afford and I can afford to make it and give it to you to keep.  </p>
<p>For my last album we were able to raise over $14,000.  We were able to pay for all of the production costs.  We played several concerts in pledgers' homes and recorded a bunch cover versions of pledgers' favorite songs.  The second pressing of the CD was paid for 100% by money made in sales of the CD at shows.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As you all know, A lot has changed in the business of making music in recent times.  It was never easy for performing musicians to finance recordings.  With the dominance of streaming services and the disappearance of so many record companies, it's gotten ever harder.</p>
<p>My last album's campaign taught me that there's still away to make fun, smart and dynamic work and deliver it to fans and hungry listeners without the budget of a big record company.  Rather than one guy putting up the big bucks to own the operation and keep the artist in debt, lots of people can pay $20 or $100 for their own copy of the work and in doing so finance the entire project.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

I've been writing songs, making records and playing gigs all over the country for several years.  I made three albums for small labels and got some college radio airplay (most notably for the song ""In The City"").   For my fourth album, I raised the funds for the production and manufacturing costs by crowd sourcing and I had great success with it.  I was able to make my finest collection of songs with complete artistic control and not come out in debt to a label.  
With each album, I keep trying to up the stakes on the songwriting craft, the production and the quality of the performances.  I try to make albums you can return to over and over again, songs you can take with you.

What We Need & What You Get
We're looking to raise $20,000 to pay for the production of this album and to pay for costs of digital mastering, design and manufacturing of the album for digital download, CD and Vinyl record.   Any additional money made over the target amount will be used to pay for the cost of producing videos for songs from the new album.
With a pledge at the starting level you can pre-order your own download, CD or vinyl LP copy of the new album.  There are many more cool incentive perks for pledges of different levels.  You can have singed lyrics sheets or posters.  I will record a studio version of the cover song of your choice.  You can even pledge and order a concert in your home for you and your friends. 

The Impact
Like all of the musicians I love best, I make music because I love making music.  I  work hard at making my songs, my records and my shows fun, well crafted and easy to listen to.  If you'd like to hear this music, pledge what you can afford and I can afford to make it and give it to you to keep.  
For my last album we were able to raise over $14,000.  We were able to pay for all of the production costs.  We played several concerts in pledgers' homes and recorded a bunch cover versions of pledgers' favorite songs.  The second pressing of the CD was paid for 100% by money made in sales of the CD at shows.

Risks & Challenges
As you all know, A lot has changed in the business of making music in recent times.  It was never easy for performing musicians to finance recordings.  With the dominance of streaming services and the disappearance of so many record companies, it's gotten ever harder.
My last album's campaign taught me that there's still away to make fun, smart and dynamic work and deliver it to fans and hungry listeners without the budget of a big record company.  Rather than one guy putting up the big bucks to own the operation and keep the artist in debt, lots of people can pay $20 or $100 for their own copy of the work and in doing so finance the entire project.

Other Ways You Can Help
I'm not looking to shake anybody down for money who can't afford it.  If you dig the music and you can afford to pre-order a copy of the new album or otherwise pledge, I ask that you contribute what you can afford.  If you can't afford to contribute any money, please check out my website: www.miltonmusic.com, take a listen to the music and pass along the link to the website and this campaign to anyone you know.  If you like any of my songs, sing them, play them, listen to them, tell your friends and come see me play some time.   Thank you all!!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Become part of Fyerfly’s team to bring this hauntingly intimate debut album to the world, by pre-ordering a limited edition bundle!</h3>
<p>Hello there, it’s <a href=""http://www.fyerfly.com.au"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Fyerfly</a> here! I’m incredibly excited to announce the coming of my brand new album entitled ‘Connect’; and this is your official invite to become a special part of it!</p>
<p><strong>Background</strong><br/>As a single mother of two children under 9 and in my (early!) 40’s, I’ve been writing, studying and working towards the recording of my first album over the past several years.</p>
<p>...And now the moment has finally arrived!</p>
<p>I began writing poetry from a young age and returned to my music after a long career as a designer and business owner. A classically trained multi-instrumentalist, I was strongly influenced by orchestral composers, jazz, blues &amp; a love of grunge &amp; alternative rock. The resulting sound is a blend of these genres in a delivery of sensual <a href=""https://www.allmusic.com/style/sadcore-ma0000012286"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">sadcore</a> songs.</p>
<p>My album ‘Connect’ is about embracing the parts of oneself that is usually kept hidden. To honour and love the darkness as well as the light, found within with whole. Together with my team of phenomenal musicians, we have created an intimate world of stories that you may lose (or perhaps find) yourself within.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>This crowd funding campaign is to help me with the release of my album. I've already invested every last cent I had into creating it, but now<i> I need your help</i> to 'bring it home'.</h3>

<p>As a mumma of two, I don't tour. Which means I am a studio artist and rely on the 'wide world of webs' to market and sell my album and merch. The beautiful thing about this is, today we have the technology to not only make this possible as independent artists; but to reach existing audiences that are already fans of our style of music. This is a beautiful opportunity that never existed in the music industry until recently and it means I can remain available to my children.</p>
<p>As a past branding specialist, I've been maximising my knowledge by studying a highly respected music marketing course and implementing these digital marketing techniques to grow my online community (I may have even found some of you this way!) .</p>
<p>The money raised through this campaign will help me contribute to the costs of my CD's and merchandise and to market my album on a grand international scale. Any funds raised above my target, will go towards hiring a music publicist who will help me do all the things I know little about such as media releases, access to industry contacts in radio, media, magazine and blogs etc. as well as film a music video/s for my songs. And more marketing ;)</p>
<p>Without your support, I will remain eternally grateful for the opportunity to have created and produced a beautiful album of my stories. It's been a life changing experience and I have found myself and my people through this journey. I am already blessed.</p>
<p><i>With </i>your generous support I will be fuelled, motivated, inspired and unstoppable in achieving my dreams, which is to create a self-sustaining career through my music. I will find and nurture my fans all over the world, and together we will all enjoy this magic musical world of artistic expression...!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I am seeking $5,000 to cover the following costs (inc gst)</p>
<ul>
<li>$2,230 for CDs</li>
<li>$1,200 for tshirts</li>
<li>$300 candles/leather/materials</li>
<li>$500 Online marketing (Facebook/GoogleAds)</li>
<li>$200 upgrade my web store</li>
<li>campaign charges, credit card charges, taxes, postage and contingencies</li>
</ul>
<p><i>(I've already invested $24.5k in Production, Musicians, Sound engineering/Mixing/Mastering, Travel &amp; Accommodation)</i></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">----------------------</p>
<p>Have you ever had that silent gushing feeling that goes with knowing that something you've done has helped enrich someone else's life? Well by contributing to this campaign, that's exactly what you'll be doing for me. I want you to know that as my supporter, I see you as a part of my fan based label. Without your help, I may never be heard, so you backing me validates me as an artist. I want to show you how much I appreciate your help and offer you what you'll value most through these perks. They’ve been prepared for you with love and consideration, and I hope that that is also how they’ll be received.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>In simple terms, if just <strong>50 people contribute AU$100</strong> I could reach my target. That's exciting!!  With my love and gratitude, I could send you all your exclusive perks, relish this journey with you as a partner AND release my album directly to the people that love my kind of sound and culture.</p>
<p>If <strong>100 people would contribute AU$100</strong>, I could create a music clip/s, hire a publicist and market myself as well as any established pro, and prove that <i>fan based labels</i> mean more than any commercial entity could, because you actually care. That's powerful!! I'm sure I'd cry.</p>
<p>So why trust me? Firstly because you love my music and my culture. You know that my team and I have already produced quality results and my album is something that should be shared. So far I've released two singles in my music career and won a partial scholarship with US Music Business Coach Cari Cole with my debut single, 'Captured'; I raised Music Label interest with both my single releases 'Captured' and 'Golden Arrow'; I work with a highly respected production team and with talented musicians (some composers in their own rights), and together we create beautiful music. So not only are you supporting me, but you are also supporting people like me in the 'indie-music' business. </p>
<p>This is only the beginning. Just imagine what I can do with an entire album...?! I believe in me and I hope you do too.</p>

<p>Multi-instrumentalist and composer Rob Reich is quintessentially what makes the San Francisco music scene a vibrant and vital mecca for independent music; he’s become one of its stalwart underground artists. Steeped in music since beginning piano lessons at age three, he graduated with a degree in Music Composition from Oberlin Conservatory of Music, studying with composers John Luther Adams and Pauline Oliveros. Reich subsequently moved to the Bay Area, where he discovered the accordion, now his primary instrument. Over the years he’s played with many genre-defying bands including Tin Hat and Gaucho. In January 2019, he released ""Swings Left"", an album of original swing music. Reich’s musical voice lives on the edges of jazz, classical, and pop music, embodying a spirit of irreverent experimentation with a strong melodic core.

<p>Luke's been my closest friend the last 6 years of my life.  We were roommates, become fathers together, started a band together, and now started a church together.</p>
<p>Every chapter of this journey has been marked by Luke's faithful and selfless love and support of me, my family, and all those connected to our endeavors.</p>
<p>If you've been in any proximity of him, you've been <strong>seen, supported, and strengthened</strong> by his peace-seeking and peace-making ability to ask the right question, serve the right need, and give you the right amount of space and challenge to succeed. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>By giving towards this surprise gift, we will send three loud messages to Luke</p>
<p>1. THANK YOU!!!</p>
<p>2. YOU AND YOUR MUSIC ARE A GIFT TO THIS WORLD! </p>
<p>3. WE WANT TO RETURN THE FAVOR AND <strong>SEE, SUPPORT, AND STRENGTHEN YOU</strong> in your dreams and serve the need to make that happen....with money and words of encouragement!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Your Part</h3>
<p><strong>1. Moolah!</strong> Give $30, 100, 200, whatever.... towards our goal fo $3K which go to helping him finish his recording faster!</p>
<p><strong>2. Write an encouraging note</strong> for him to be make time to be selfish, to take time to WRITE, RECORD, PRODUCE, AND RELEASE his beautiful music to the world AS SOON AS POSSIBLE! </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The biggest thing that holds Luke back from producing is <strong>money,</strong> and<strong> time. The reason why he doesn't make as much time</strong> is the great amount of care he has for his friends, family, gym community, and church community. By us pooling our money and encouraging words together, we will help him overcome those hurdles to do what he's longing to do...what's he's made to...and bring beautiful music into this world :)</p>

In August I worked with producer, composer and musician Andrew Turpening (BMI, <a href=""https://www.entraance.com/about"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.entraance.com/about</a>) to record a cover of the Cuban song “Ámame Como Soy” and my first original song, “Leaving For The Amazon.” I came off the recording session motivated and charged with energy. Now I am determined to record an EP with Andrew from December 8-13, 2019. The Extended Play record will showcase seven songs: four originals and three covers, about 28 minutes of music total. If I meet this campaign goal, I will be able to record the EP, master it, make 1,000 CD copies, and launch my artist website. After the CDs are duplicated, I will sign and number each one before they are shrink-wrapped. I envision a classic Blue Note look for the album design.

<p>I’m George Coleman Jr. a drummer, composer and son of two musical jazz greats, saxophone legend George Coleman Sr. and organist, composer and vocalist, Gloria Coleman. Though I have played with many of the greats over the years on their projects, I haven't released a solo album of my own, and as many of my friends, fans and colleagues have kindly reminded me, it’s a bit overdue.

<h3><strong>About the Project</strong></h3>
<h3><i>""Resurgence"" is an album that is all about joy. </i></h3>
<p><i>Resurgence</i> is an album that takes my Memphis roots in blues music and my love of Cuban rhythm and marries them in a celebration of joy that is bound to make you dance. It's a feel good album all about heart and soul, a celebration of love, and a tribute in joy to a dear friend of mine, the late <strong><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Mabern"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Harold Mabern</a>,</strong> a Memphis-born jazz pianist who always led with his heart in life and music. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1570929227/drwsruj5kkmg9wamwds4.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>My mother, <strong><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gloria_Coleman"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Gloria Coleman</a></strong>, is really my main inspiration for the blues elements of this project, and my trip to Cuba to learn to play Bata is my inspiration for the Latin flavored material on the album. My father, <strong><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Coleman"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">George Coleman Sr.</a></strong>, will be writing an original piece for the album to commemorate Harold and will be playing on the record along with my band. </p>
<p>Our producer on the day will be the legendary drummer, and my own personal mentor, <strong><a href=""http://www.michaelcarvin.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Michael Carvin</a> </strong>. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>My goal for this album is to make you feel so good you can't help but celebrate. </i></p>
<h3><i>A Tribute to Harold</i></h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1570915423/uspkolrs9sj0mt4wltzj.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Life is funny and just when you think you’ve got it licked, even for a minute, tragedy can strike. Two weeks before I planned to finalize this IndieGoGo project for my recording, legendary pianist Harold Mabern, my dad’s best friend and bandmate since their days back in high school in Memphis, unexpectedly passed away.</p>
<p>My dad was obviously devastated, as very few of his friends and musical colleagues are still alive, but Harold was much more than that--- he was family, and one of dad’s last links to his birthplace, Memphis, Tennessee -that was the incubator of his genius. Harold was also a musical and spiritual uncle to me, and besides being one of the greatest musicians I’ve ever known, he was one of the kindest, funniest and musically knowledgeable people you would ever meet. I never heard him raise his voice to a single person in all the years I knew him and he taught and mentored hundreds of students in his almost 40 years of teaching at William Paterson University.</p>
<p>On the way back from a performance I’d taken my dad to after Harold's passing, in an effort to cheer him up, he said to me, <strong>“Son if you want me to, I’d be happy to play on a track or two of your project.""</strong></p>
<p>I wasn’t actually sure how to respond so I was quiet for a minute and he said, “I know you want this to be your own thing, but while Sonny Stitt said, 'Every tub must sit on its own bottom,' it would be nice to do a tune of Mabern’s, and I’d like to write an original, maybe a ballad for him, as part of the project.” </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Legendary saxophonist, my father, George Coleman Sr. is writing a special track for this album. </i></p>
<h3><strong>Why Now?</strong></h3>
<h3><i>This is my opportunity to bring more joy into the world. </i></h3>
<p>The world needs more joy. The world needs more love. It's too easy for us to forget to celebrate this one, beautiful life we have to live when the pressures of daily life are causing us so much stress and anxiety. I want to remind you that you deserve happiness, that you deserve to feel love, that you deserve to smile and dance and be free. </p>
<p>Harold's passing reminds me to be present to every moment and make it count. I need to make this album now because it's my opportunity to bring light into the world and to do it with my dad while he's still playing at his prime. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>I'm ready to make you DANCE. </i></p>

Resurgence is an album that takes my Memphis roots in blues music and my love of Cuban rhythm and marries them in a celebration of joy that is bound to make you dance. It's a feel good album all about heart and soul, a celebration of love, and a tribute in joy to a dear friend of mine, the late Harold Mabern, a Memphis-born jazz pianist who always led with his heart in life and music. 

My mother, Gloria Coleman, is really my main inspiration for the blues elements of this project, and my trip to Cuba to learn to play Bata is my inspiration for the Latin flavored material on the album. My father, George Coleman Sr., will be writing an original piece for the album to commemorate Harold and will be playing on the record along with my band. 
Our producer on the day will be the legendary drummer, and my own personal mentor, Michael Carvin . 
My goal for this album is to make you feel so good you can't help but celebrate. 
A Tribute to Harold

Life is funny and just when you think you’ve got it licked, even for a minute, tragedy can strike. Two weeks before I planned to finalize this IndieGoGo project for my recording, legendary pianist Harold Mabern, my dad’s best friend and bandmate since their days back in high school in Memphis, unexpectedly passed away.
My dad was obviously devastated, as very few of his friends and musical colleagues are still alive, but Harold was much more than that--- he was family, and one of dad’s last links to his birthplace, Memphis, Tennessee -that was the incubator of his genius. Harold was also a musical and spiritual uncle to me, and besides being one of the greatest musicians I’ve ever known, he was one of the kindest, funniest and musically knowledgeable people you would ever meet. I never heard him raise his voice to a single person in all the years I knew him and he taught and mentored hundreds of students in his almost 40 years of teaching at William Paterson University.
On the way back from a performance I’d taken my dad to after Harold's passing, in an effort to cheer him up, he said to me, “Son if you want me to, I’d be happy to play on a track or two of your project.""
I wasn’t actually sure how to respond so I was quiet for a minute and he said, “I know you want this to be your own thing, but while Sonny Stitt said, 'Every tub must sit on its own bottom,' it would be nice to do a tune of Mabern’s, and I’d like to write an original, maybe a ballad for him, as part of the project.” 
Legendary saxophonist, my father, George Coleman Sr. is writing a special track for this album. 
Why Now?
This is my opportunity to bring more joy into the world. 
The world needs more joy. The world needs more love. It's too easy for us to forget to celebrate this one, beautiful life we have to live when the pressures of daily life are causing us so much stress and anxiety. I want to remind you that you deserve happiness, that you deserve to feel love, that you deserve to smile and dance and be free. 
Harold's passing reminds me to be present to every moment and make it count. I need to make this album now because it's my opportunity to bring light into the world and to do it with my dad while he's still playing at his prime. 
I'm ready to make you DANCE.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We, the members of Carpe Diem String Quartet and Erberk Eryılmaz, began our relationship in 2012 when we were serendipitously introduced to one of his works, Miniatures Set No. 4, while performing a residency at Carnegie Mellon University. Since then, we have been inspired by each other’s creative energies - we are moved by Eryılmaz’s unique combination of the traditional classical string quartet with exotic, exciting, and vivacious Middle Eastern and Eastern European folk elements; Eryılmaz is encouraged by our ability to effectively translate and interpret the energy of his musical language to the national and international stage. </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>America is a unique multicultural country - people are able to experience a plethora of cultures each day without leaving their hometown. As an immigrant composer, Eryılmaz feels a responsibility to contribute to the richness of the American culture by bringing music from Turkey, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe to the American stage. The members of Carpe Diem String Quartet feel a responsibility to support the voices of living composers, celebrate their unique musical voices, and interpret the music compellingly and accessibly. With this recording, we all hope that listeners are able to experience and be moved by new cultures, and feel more connected to beauties that all humankind has to offer.</p>

<h3>A Sneak Peek Into the Works - Words by the Composer</h3>
<p><u>Dances of the Yogurt Maker for String Quartet</u></p>
<p>Dances of the Yogurt Maker is my free improvisation on eight folk dances from Silifke (Southern Turkey). Silifke is a town that is famous for their yogurt and other dairy products. In the piece, the instruments imitate Turkish folk instruments and their playing styles. All eight dances are connected to form one continuous work. All of these songs are love songs, but they somehow mention yogurt and other dairy products either to make the lyrics rhyme, or to describe their emotions. For example, in “Ham Çökelek,” a husband wishes that his wife chokes and dies while eating raw cheese curds so he can spend the rest of his life with the neighbor girl. On the other hand, in “Silifke’nin Yogurdu,” yogurt is used to rhyme while the protagonist is describing how much he loves his lover. All these folk songs are similarly absurd, fun, and upbeat. I tried to bring that character to the piece.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><u>Insistent Music for Piano Quintet</u></p>
<p>Insistent Music (2019), a five-movement work with connected movements, is inspired by the folk music of Eastern Europe which has endless energy and an insistent optimistic attitude towards sad life events. These inspirations present themselves in the work as a variety of repeated percussive patterns and bursting melodic lines inspired by the folk string playing styles of Eastern Europe.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><u>Hoppa! 3 for String Quartet and Darbuka</u></p>
<p>Hoppa! 3 for String Quartet and Darbuka is part of a series of works on immigration and music that traveled as a result of migration. Hoppa! 3 particularly focuses on the shared folk dances and songs between Turkey and Syria. These two cultures speak two different languages, Turkish and Arabic, but when it comes to music many things are inseparable. This piece emphasizes the unity between the music of these cultures and makes them live together in music. The work consists of four connected movements inspired by the masters of string playing from Eastern Europe to the Middle East.</p>
<p>The title of the work “Hoppa!” is an expression used commonly in Turkish and Eastern European cultures meaning “Come on! Let’s go!”. This forward, ecstatic attitude describes the primary aim of the work, which is to bring the raw energy of folk music from local villages, street weddings, and sunflower fields to the concert stage. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><u>Thracian Airs of Besime Sultan for String Quartet</u></p>
<p>Thracian Airs of Besime Sultan (2015) is my free improvisation on the folk music of the Thracian region. This six-movement, through-composed piece explores folkloric dances and styles from a large geographical area, including Bulgaria, Greece, Romania and Turkey.</p>
<p>The work was commissioned by Apollo Chamber Players (featuring Tim Pitts and Matthew McClung) and Roma clarinetist Ismail Lumanovski, and it is dedicated to my late grandmother, Besime Civelek. My grandmother was the only member of my family who was from Thrace, and in our last phone conversation, she expressed how much she loves my music. During the summer of 2014, she and I listened to my entire catalog of works. As the sultan of the family, we affectionately called her 'Besime Sultan'.</p>
<p>Thracian Airs of Besime Sultan exists in three versions: I. String quartet, II. Chamber ensemble (clarinet, percussion and string quintet), and III. Solo clarinet, percussion and orchestra.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><u>Miniatures Set No. 4 for String Quartet</u></p>
<p>The Miniature, a visual art form popular during the Ottoman Empire, was used to represent important events in compact paintings. Miniatures Set No. 4 (2013) is a five-movement suite based on Turkish folk dances and instrumental song styles. Although all of the material is original, these movements are highly influenced by the playing styles of master performers of previous centuries. </p>
<p>""Sirto"" is a fast 2/4 dance which is also shared with Greeks and very common on the European side of Turkey. </p>
<p>""Saz Semaisi"" is an instrumental section that is used in religious rituals and in Ottoman court music. This movement later turns to a çiftetelli, which is a type of belly dance. </p>
<p>""Bolu Oyun Havası"" is a 2/4, medium tempo dance from northern Turkey. </p>
<p>""Taksim"" is a very common improvisational movement which is a modal preparation to a song or an instrumental piece in traditional Turkish music. </p>
<p>""Sıksaray Horon Havası"" is a very fast dance in 7/16 from northeast Turkey. This dance is commonly played by a small stringed instrument called a kemençe. With the extended techniques of string playing, the whole ensemble imitates the sound that is produced by this instrument.</p>
<p>Although in folk and traditional music the meters would stay the same throughout each movement, since dancing is not a part of the performance of the piece, in this set of miniatures the meters change freely for fun as well as aesthetic purposes.</p> <p><u>Miniatures Set No. 5 for String Quartet and Turkish Folk Percussion</u></p>
<p>Miniatures Set No. 5 for String Quartet and Turkish Folk Percussion (2015) is a five-movement suite based on Turkish folk dances and instrumental song styles. The work was originally written for Saxophone, Viola and Optional Percussion, and was commissioned by the Irrelevants (saxophonist Carrie Koffman and violist Tim Deighton). The set covers a large geographical area from the east to the west of Turkey. </p>
<p>The five movements are:</p>
<p>I – Hopa Barı (Dance of Hopa): A fast dance in 6/8 from the northeast region of Turkey </p>
<p>II – Kaşık Havası (Spoon Air): Wooden spoon dance from Central Anatolia</p>
<p>III – Aksak Horo (Irregular Metered Dance): Irregular metered dance from the Balkans</p>
<p>IV – Ağır Aksak Şarkı (Slow Irregular Metered Song): A song style that is common in Ottoman court music</p>
<p>V – Göbek Havası (Belly Air): A famous belly dance air from the Thracian region of Turkey</p>
<p> </p>

<p><strong>If I can raise the funds to do this, it will help me continue on my musical/life path. I make my living by touring, and playing festivals.

<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><strong>I'm asking for $25,000 that's the minimum I need to record in a professional studio, pay an engineer, musicians, mastering,  CD design/art work, manufacturing of hard copies , and mailing costs.  If I'm successful and make more than the goal, the funds will be put towards more time in the studio, because in the recording world, time is money, and time is a luxury.  To be able to record without always watching the clock would be sublime.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Check out my list of perks to see what I'm offering. If there's something I'm not offering, and you have and idea of what you'd like, feel free to ask, maybe a songwriting lesson/visit to the studio etc</strong></p>
<p><strong>If I don't reach my goal, I'll start recording anyway. I always prefer to record an album in one or two chunks of time. I don't like drawing it out over a long period I think the focus can get lost. That being said, I would keep recording, the process would take  longer because I'll have to take my time in terms of coming up with funds to pay for studio time etc. Whatever happens my goal is to put out a record. If the funds are lower than my goal, I'll have to cut some corners on studio time, musicians etc.  I'm grateful to have been able to have put out all the CD'S I have, and I will find a way to carry on!!  You're support would make this process happen in a timely way, and would allow me to not have to make artistic compromises. </strong></p>

<p><strong>I've successfully completed other crowdfunding campaigns. One for my Winter album and one with THE LYNNeS for our CD ""Heartbreak Song For The Radio"".

<p>The ACA Symphony Orchestra is going to play a concert at New York's  Carnegie Hall in March, and you can get a lasting record of the event while helping support this great group of kids on  this fantastic trip. </p>
<p>Just click <strong>Back It</strong> to become a sponsor.</p>
<h3>About the Concert</h3>
<p>The ACA Symphony Orchestra is scheduled to perform at Carnegie Hall on March 16th. Prior to the performance, they will participate in an ensemble workshop with a festival clinician. After their performance, they will receive written critiques, a group photo, and an audio recording of their performance.</p>
<p>Repertoire for Carnegie Concert: Anna Mercereau, Teacher, Conductor, and Director</p>
<ul>
<li>""Hoe-down"" from Rodeo, Aaron Copland</li>
<li>American In Paris, George Gershwin</li>
<li>Tribute to Adagio for Strings, Samuel Barber</li>
<li>New World Symphony, Antonín Dvořák</li>
<li>The Columbia River Suite by Doris Gazda<br/> </li>
</ul>
<h3>About the Trip</h3>
<p>In the weekend leading up to the Carnegie Hall performance, we will tour the Metropolitan Opera House and attend a Broadway show. We’ll take in some science, art and architecture at the Museum of Natural History, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and St. Patrick’s Cathedral. We’ll also get a chance to see iconic New York City, including the Empire State Building, Rockefeller Center, and Central Park.</p>
<p>That Monday evening, we will perform at Carnegie Hall!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>How You Can Help - What You Get</h3>
<p>There are two ways you can help our group make enough to go on this trip:</p>
<p>1. You can share this email via social media.<br/>2. You can click click <strong>Back It</strong> to become a sponsor and select a donation level. </p>
<p>Every level of support will receive a thank you recording called ""Best of the Season 2019"" via digital download. This recording will only be available through this campaign, and includes a great collection of beautifully played chamber and orchestra pieces - some contemporary and some traditional. If you'd like to support at a higher level, you can choose a CD, a personalized postcard from NYC, or a photograph of your student at Carnegie Hall. We'll ship your thank you gift to you in May.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>How Funds Will Help Support The Trip</h3>
<p>The cost for each student to take this trip is $2,150, including airfare, food, lodging, a Broadway production, and a few museums. The families of these kids have already been doing extensive fundraising, including busking, bake sales, and bottle collections (to name a few).</p>
<p>Our goal for this fundraiser is for each student to raise at least $350. If each student can arrange just a handful of these sponsorships, we can defray much of the cost of this life-changing trip, and allow them to focus on preparing to play their first concert at Carnegie.</p>
<p>When we pitched CrowdFunding to the Orchestra students and parents, I asked them how they wanted to divide the proceeds from this campaign and was really humbled by their response: Every single student and parent in attendance said they wanted all proceeds shared among the whole group.</p>
<h3>Timeline For This Campaign, The Concert, and Recordings</h3>
<p>This campaign closes mid-December. The trip is in March.<br/>Beginning in April, we'll collect recordings from the season into a Best Of collection, and make a professionally produced CD and digital download. In May, symphony members will get together to package and ship the CDs to supporters.</p>
<p>If you donate at the postcard level, you'll get the download and CD, plus you'll also receive a personalized postcard from NYC in March.</p>
<p>If you donate at the picture level, you'll receive the download and CD (May), the postcard in March, and the photo in May. </p>

<p><strong>MY STORY:</strong> I'm <a href=""http://www.elainedame.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Elaine Dame</a>, a Chicago-based jazz singer, bandleader, flutist and vocal jazz instructor. I have been performing professionally (it's how I make my living) for almost twenty years. I'm gearing up for my 3rd recording and I need your help. Do you like all the excellent music from the 1970s? You do?! Far out! Read on!</p>
<p><b>WHY THIS? </b>I have been thinking about this project for almost five years, wanting to sing and record all my favorite music from the 1970s, arranged in a jazz style. You see, I grew up in the 70s, so the connection that I have to music from this era is deep and sentimental. I can hear any song from that decade and instantly think of a specific moment growing up in Stevensville, MI. For those of us that grew up in the 1970s, we were blessed with some inCREDibly good music, including blues, pop-rock, soft rock, classic rock, funk, R &amp; B and hey, even disco. </p>
<p>There will be a wide range of styles and songs on the recording and I've enlisted one of the most talented musicians and composers in Chicago, or anywhere for that matter, to help me arrange these tunes: <a href=""http://www.chrismadsen.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Chris Madsen</a>.</p>
<p>For those of us that grew up with the music, it will most certainly bring about joyous feelings of nostalgia and you'll be able to hear a classic song from the era completely redesigned, making you think of and feel the tune in a new way. Additionally, I'm hoping to introduce ""new"" music to new listeners of all ages. Finally, this is feel-good music! We need it now more than ever! </p>
<p><strong>THE BREAD, MAN:</strong>  producing your own CD is incredibly costly. I produced my first CD in 2005 and the total cost was $20,000.  My sophomore recording, released in 2015, cost almost $28,000. It is virtually impossible for an independent artist like me to make a recording without financial help. I am engaging in the day-to-day hard work that it takes to keep a small business going, while still trying to grow as an artist and put food on the table.  In addition, the recession took its toll on musicians (I lost ALL of my income sources at the time, including income from private music lessons, corporate events, weddings, clubs....everyone was downsizing) and we were all just struggling to make it through, as most people were.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, musicians like myself have a need to document our progress, to tell our musical stories, to express ourselves in a collaborative way with our colleagues. Then after we create the music, we want to get it out there via radio promotion, industry publications, TV appearances and live touring. We want to take our time and do it right, without rushing, so we're shooting for a July 2020 release.</p>
<p>I have a burning desire to record this material and create something new! Boogie on down to those perks, man!</p>
<p><strong>YOUR CONTRIBUTION:</strong> no matter how small, will help me make my dream come true. </p>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get </h3>
<p>I've got some incredible perks for you to choose from, from a concert in your home to music lessons to YOU picking one of YOUR favorite tunes from the 1970s for us to include on the recording.</p>
<p>Also, you may be asking yourself: Why does she need all that dough to make a CD?! Explore the pie chart below (who doesn't love a good pie chart?!) to see exactly where the money will be spent.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help:</h3>
<p>If you choose not to contribute, that's O.K. It doesn't mean you can't help!

<p><u>Short Summary</u></p>
<p>We’re an independent band of four brothers who have been playing music together for the past 16 years.</p>
<p>As an independent self-managing and self released band, we have been able to retain creative control and freedom of our music, preserving authenticity in the way we write, produce and record music. We feel that this is has had a positive influence on our music and crowd funding would allow us to keep working the way we would like to.</p>
<p>Previous releases - ‘Wash Away’, Wake Up In A Dream’ and ‘Moving in Slow Motion’ --have done really well, reaching number 2 in the Spotify Viral 50 chart, some tracks with over 350k streams, with continued support by BBC Radio 6 Music, Radio Scotland &amp; Radio nan Gaidheal, Passport Approved worldwide, STV and TV sync work with Hollyoaks, Tattoo Fixers and BT sport. </p>
<p>Our album is not only something that we as a band have always aspired to, but which our fans have been requesting since the beginning of our professional music career. As we have self-funded all of our EPs, we have only been financially capable of releasing a maximum of 4 songs at a time, but with additional contribution from fans we would be able to afford the recording and releasing of our 11 track debut album. </p>
<p>We have recorded half the album, six songs, so far, investing £6000 of our own money. We’re aiming to raise a further £15,000 which would help us finish the recording of the album, pay for producers, studio time and mastering of the album as well as the release and marketing of the album. £6,000 would secure the recording, production, studio time and mastering of the album. £9,000 would be invested into our PR and digital marketing such as press, blogs and radio plugs as well as band merchandise, music videos, artwork, vinyls and CDs. Contributions would help us achieve our dream of releasing an album that we’ve been tirelessly writing for the past three years.</p>
<p>The backing of contributors would give us the opportunity to produce our largest catalogue of work so far. We are extremely excited to present our album to our fans to show the new direction and soundscape that our music has taken, as a result of Ded Rabbit working with sound engineers and producers of RAK studio, Robbie Nelson and Mike Horner.</p>
<p>Through the perks we can offer, we will be able to give something back to the listeners, fans and contributors.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Originally from Yorkshire, Ded Rabbit moved to the Highlands in 1996 and through the isolation and a developing love of music, the brothers started playing music together. After moving to Edinburgh to study, they started working together in the studio, releasing their EPs ‘Wash Away’ 2014, ‘Wake Up In A Dream’ and ‘Moving In Slow Motion’. In 2015 the brotherly unit began their highly successful partnership with Glasgow based Rocket Science Studios, who have recorded the likes of Texas and Bell &amp; Sebastian.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Their music echoes the influences they cite like Hendrix and The Beatles (post-1965) but they are avid gig-goers too, eager to see what is going on nowadays, so they are just as likely to be out watching Peace or Palma Violets as they are at home listening to Abbey Road or Electric Ladyland”- John Paul Mason, Daily Record.</p>
<p>“With hints of The Housemartins and early Arctic Monkeys infused with a twist of funk and original lyrics, they have created a distinctive and highly listenable sound of their own.” - Olaf Furniss &amp; Derick Mackinnon, Artist Of The Week: Scotland On Sunday.</p>
<p>“I know they're very hard working and are building up a good following in the capital... classic Indie sound” - Vic Galloway, BBC Radio Scotland.</p>
<p>""Undeniable stage presence and performance skills”(-)”An exciting live band that will appeal widely and who are definitely festival-ready” - David Balfour, Record Of The Day.</p>
<p>The brothers are working on their debut album which is due to be released in 2020.</p>
<p>“It’s an explosive affair when you see Ded Rabbit live. I’d put them up there with Catfish and The Bottlemen as one of the best live acts around at the moment.” - Jim Gellatly.Amazing Radio.</p>
<p><u>W</u><u>hy </u><u>I</u><u>t's </u><u>I</u><u>mportant </u><u>T</u><u>o </u><u>Us</u></p>
<p>You only get one shot at a debut album! As a band of four brothers we’ve always dreamt of releasing our debut album. Maintaining creative control is something we’ve always felt strongly about and as it’s our first album we want it to be how exactly how we want it.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><u>What You’ll Help Us Achieve</u></p>
<p>-Contributors would help make the album possible - from pre-production &amp; production itself to post-production. This would include travel costs, studio time, production and engineer costs &amp; mastering. </p>
<p>- Contributors would also help pay for PR Promotion of the Album through paying blogs, radio pluggers, music videos, digital marketing through Facebook &amp; Instagram etc.</p>
<p>The funds would also go towards making physical CDs and vinyl as well as new merchandise. </p>
<p>- Releasing a 11 track album would be financially beneficial for us, not only through plays and purchasing of the album but also through Sync. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><u>What We Need</u></p>
<p>Break down:</p>
<p>PR £1500</p>
<p>Radio plugger £1500</p>
<p>Digital Marketing £1000</p>
<p>Artwork £500</p>
<p>Videos £1000</p>
<p>1000 Vinyl &amp; 100 CDs £3000</p>
<p>Merch £500</p>
<p>Recording – production, studio time £4000</p>
<p>Mastering £2000</p>
<p>Total - £15,000</p>
<p> </p>
<p><u>Where The Funds Will Go</u></p>
<p>The first £6,000 will be dedicated to the production and post-production process of recording and mastering the album. With £6,000 this would guarantee us -insert number of hours of studio time &amp; amount of songs – with producers &amp; sound engineers Mike Horner and Robbie Nelson as well as paying for the post-production time required for them to edit and master the album. Any money raised past £6,000 will be dedicated to the release. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><u>The Impact</u></p>
<p>Now as a band, we are motivated to take our musical careers to the next level by investing in the expertise of RAK Studio producers. By working with Robbie &amp; Mike our aim is to try to capture our live sound. Self funding the album enables us to maintain creative control which has always been something important to us brothers. Being able to record in RAK Studio’s large live studio rooms, we have been able to capture the live sound and essence of our music. </p>
<p>Last year we earned as much money through sync work (TV. and adverts) as we did through live performances. Having a whole new album of 11 tracks would give us a platform to further pursue such revenue, so increasing our sustainability. </p>
<p>Having further financial support towards the album would ensure a successful PR and radio campaign and would guarantee us further exposure and promotion of the album, whilst building on our previous success with our EP releases.</p>
<p>Every investment, no matter how small or large, whether we meet our full target or not, would be a integral part of the recording and releasing of the album. </p>
<p>Indiegogo allows us to use any funds raised through the campaign process whether on target or below, but with contributors’support the full target could be reached &amp; we would not only be able to record the remaining tracks of the album, but invest in the promotion and marketing launch that it deserves.</p>
<p>Any contribution will bring the materialisation and reality of recording and realising the album a little closer. Even if Ded Rabbit don’t meet their target, the money contributed will be used towards the recording and release of the album and will make it possible.</p>
<p>This is the first time we have crowd funded a project although we have always self released and self managed our music. We’ve managed to achieve a remarkable amount self releasing our previous EP’s with over 350k spotify streams on some tracks, tours across Europe, regular airplay on BBC Radio 6 music, Radio Scotland, Radio nan Gaedheal, Passport Approved worldwide, STV  &amp; regular TV sync work with Hollyoaks, Tattoo Fixers and BT sport. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><u>Risks &amp; Challenges</u></p>
<p>One obstacle that could be a problem is we don’t raise enough money to finish the album in RAK studios. If this were to happen we have a plan B in place whereby we would only use RAK studios for the bigger drum sounds and use a smaller live room in a cheaper studio or Mike’s home studio as an alternative. </p>
<p>Any contribution would be greatly appreciated but we need all the help we can get right now and if you’re able to let anyone else know about helping us reach our goal then that would be brilliant. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>You can help spread the word by using the Indiegogo share tools and sharing it on social media. </p>
<p>Thanks for all your help and support!</p>

With £6,000 this would guarantee us -insert number of hours of studio time & amount of songs – with producers & sound engineers Mike Horner and Robbie Nelson as well as paying for the post-production time required for them to edit and master the album. Any money raised past £6,000 will be dedicated to the release. 
 
The Impact
Now as a band, we are motivated to take our musical careers to the next level by investing in the expertise of RAK Studio producers. By working with Robbie & Mike our aim is to try to capture our live sound. Self funding the album enables us to maintain creative control which has always been something important to us brothers. Being able to record in RAK Studio’s large live studio rooms, we have been able to capture the live sound and essence of our music. 
Last year we earned as much money through sync work (TV. and adverts) as we did through live performances. Having a whole new album of 11 tracks would give us a platform to further pursue such revenue, so increasing our sustainability. 
Having further financial support towards the album would ensure a successful PR and radio campaign and would guarantee us further exposure and promotion of the album, whilst building on our previous success with our EP releases.
Every investment, no matter how small or large, whether we meet our full target or not, would be a integral part of the recording and releasing of the album. 
Indiegogo allows us to use any funds raised through the campaign process whether on target or below, but with contributors’support the full target could be reached & we would not only be able to record the remaining tracks of the album, but invest in the promotion and marketing launch that it deserves.
Any contribution will bring the materialisation and reality of recording and realising the album a little closer. Even if Ded Rabbit don’t meet their target, the money contributed will be used towards the recording and release of the album and will make it possible.
This is the first time we have crowd funded a project although we have always self released and self managed our music. We’ve managed to achieve a remarkable amount self releasing our previous EP’s with over 350k spotify streams on some tracks, tours across Europe, regular airplay on BBC Radio 6 music, Radio Scotland, Radio nan Gaedheal, Passport Approved worldwide, STV  & regular TV sync work with Hollyoaks, Tattoo Fixers and BT sport. 
 
Risks & Challenges
One obstacle that could be a problem is we don’t raise enough money to finish the album in RAK studios. If this were to happen we have a plan B in place whereby we would only use RAK studios for the bigger drum sounds and use a smaller live room in a cheaper studio or Mike’s home studio as an alternative. 
Any contribution would be greatly appreciated but we need all the help we can get right now and if you’re able to let anyone else know about helping us reach our goal then that would be brilliant. 
 
You can help spread the word by using the Indiegogo share tools and sharing it on social media.

What We are looking for and what you’ll get in return
For providing you with the best possible sound we chose the Serious Black Studios in the south of Munich for recording. The sessions will start next month already and we are beyond excited! As professional work is expensive, we have to come up with at least 5.000.- Euros to pay for the recording, mixing and mastering services. With this crowdfunding campaign we are trying to raise 1000.- Euros, so none of us has to suffer from hunger, thirst or even sell our parents’ houses! :)  But even if we don't reach our goal, every cent you invest is appreciated!
So now it's up to you! Contribute to this matter of our hearts and make it happen. Together we can create something great!

<p><strong>Short Summary</strong></p>
<p>Hi Friends! My name is Liam Searcy and I am a composer/performer who is currently a Musical Theatre major at Belmont University. I wrote a musical theatre song cycle titled Commitment that will be performed at 54 Below in New York on May 8th. Check it out right here:</p>
<p><a href=""https://54below.com/events/commitment-a-song-cy"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://54below.com/events/commitment-a-song-cy</a>...</p>
<p>This will be my NYC debut as a performer and composer! This Song Cycle is a collection of stand alone story songs about a word we all have different definitions for. Commitment is found to be just as beautiful as it is dangerous.</p>
<p>Right now I am fundraising $5000 total (3,500 on here) to cover the artwork, sheet music, demos, plane tickets, musicians, Broadway talent and more. This is my chance to really put my heart on the stage in every way I know how. Thanks for being a part of it.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>We are raising $5000. That will cover the amazing Broadway talent, the musicians, my producer, some plane tickets, and finalizing sheet music. Your funds will make the big concert happen without me having to go into debt! It will also reimburse some of the money I already spent getting artwork and a lot of sheet music several months ago. So thats what the funds will do for me ... what will they do for you?</p>
<p>PERKS!!!!!</p>
<p>The perks range from $10 to $500 so theres plenty of options. I must say the one I am most excited about is the sheet music collection, but go ahead and look through them all! I'd love to write you a song or do a house concert! </p>
<p><strong> If You Can't Donate... Share!</strong></p>
<p>A lot of what this concert will do for me is help me create a following of musical theatre lovers who want to watch and perform my work. Why not do that beforehand? If you wanna help out but are low on cash then share this and share my songs so people can hear my music! Thanks so much!</p>

A team of talented creators and I are putting on a unique show this April in Austin called <strong>Gorintō</strong>. It is an intimate new music multi-sensory evening length composition and visual event that is part soundscape, part classicist composition, part sound bath and part ASMR dream.<br/><br/><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;""> </span><strong style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Gorintō</strong><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;""> is the first evening length event that I have been fully in charge of producing, directing and composing, and I am exceedingly proud of it. It’s a meaningful culmination of my work in music, composition, and general pursuits of knowledge, as well as a collaboration with four critically acclaimed, talented sound artists.</span></p><p>Your contribution will help make this unique event more robust and enveloping. Helping to create a deeply immersive piece that you can get lost in for an hour. </p><p><br/>-------------------------------------<br/><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Silverman has been heavily involved in composition for the last 10 years, and worked most extensively composing for the performing arts. Working closely with companies and choreographers such as Alyson Dolan (ATX), Sarasota Contemporary Dance Company (FLA) and Kathy Dunn Hamrick Dance Company (ATX), he has composed for several evening length dance works. KDH Dance Company's fall work entitled ""</span><i style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Be Still, My Heart</i><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">"" was named one of Austin Chronicle's ""Top 10 Dance and Classical Music Joys of 2018"", and he was Nominated for Best Sound Design by the Austin Critic's Table for his 2018 composition ""</span><i style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">A Meditation</i><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">"" for choreographer Alyson Dolan.</span><br/>-------------------------------------</p><p> </p><h3>About <strong>Gorintō</strong>
</h3><p><br/><strong>Gorintō</strong> is unique in it's conception in that, unlike most musical events, the audience is not only a spectator, the audience is an experiential being. The aim of <strong>Gorintō</strong> is to make you feel like a part of a larger organism, not separate from. Like the bacteria in your stomach, or the planets in the solar system, large or small, all a part of an ever expanding system of forms informing each other's existence, incidentally and profoundly.</p><p>The set up will be in the inverted round. Audience will gather in the center of the space and are invited to lie down on a raised and padded floor covered with a range of comfort items. Audiences are encouraged to bring their own favorite comfort items as well to experience a series of projections on the ceiling of the space. Audiences will be surrounded by 5 sound artists, somewhat obscured and raised, with their performance syphoned to their ears through a quadrophonic sound system (4 speakers with separate outputs, allowing a more nuanced and spacious mixing image). The piece is narrative in scope, but abstract in practice, leaving room for the audience to glean their own experiential conclusions and feelings.</p><h3>

My name is Drew Silverman, a composer and interdisciplinary artist in Austin, TX. A team of talented creators and I are putting on a unique show this April in Austin called Gorintō. It is an intimate new music multi-sensory evening length composition and visual event that is part soundscape, part classicist composition, part sound bath and part ASMR dream. Gorintō is the first evening length event that I have been fully in charge of producing, directing and composing, and I am exceedingly proud of it. It’s a meaningful culmination of my work in music, composition, and general pursuits of knowledge, as well as a collaboration with four critically acclaimed, talented sound artists.Your contribution will help make this unique event more robust and enveloping. Helping to create a deeply immersive piece that you can get lost in for an hour. -------------------------------------Silverman has been heavily involved in composition for the last 10 years, and worked most extensively composing for the performing arts. Working closely with companies and choreographers such as Alyson Dolan (ATX), Sarasota Contemporary Dance Company (FLA) and Kathy Dunn Hamrick Dance Company (ATX), he has composed for several evening length dance works. KDH Dance Company's fall work entitled ""Be Still, My Heart"" was named one of Austin Chronicle's ""Top 10 Dance and Classical Music Joys of 2018"", and he was Nominated for Best Sound Design by the Austin Critic's Table for his 2018 composition ""A Meditation"" for choreographer Alyson Dolan.------------------------------------- About Gorintō
Gorintō is unique in it's conception in that, unlike most musical events, the audience is not only a spectator, the audience is an experiential being. The aim of Gorintō is to make you feel like a part of a larger organism, not separate from. Like the bacteria in your stomach, or the planets in the solar system, large or small, all a part of an ever expanding system of forms informing each other's existence, incidentally and profoundly.The set up will be in the inverted round. Audience will gather in the center of the space and are invited to lie down on a raised and padded floor covered with a range of comfort items. Audiences are encouraged to bring their own favorite comfort items as well to experience a series of projections on the ceiling of the space. Audiences will be surrounded by 5 sound artists, somewhat obscured and raised, with their performance syphoned to their ears through a quadrophonic sound system (4 speakers with separate outputs, allowing a more nuanced and spacious mixing image). The piece is narrative in scope, but abstract in practice, leaving room for the audience to glean their own experiential conclusions and feelings.
What We Need Because Gorintō is set up unlike most musical events, it requires a much more involved  production, much more gear, and to treat the venue more like a raw space than one with facilities readily available to house this experience. Due to this, we need funds to transform Ground Floor Theater into a wholly different, cocoon of an art space, and we need your help to do it!An additional important element of this piece is it’s intimacy, with only enough room for 35-40 guests each performance, we want each person to have ample room to lie down, bundle up, and get comfortable in the raised and padded floor. Because of this intimacy, and our attempt to keep ticket prices manageable and inclusive, any help from you would make our pursuits much more comfortable for us as well!Everyone involved is fully intent on making this show happen no matter what, so we will use whatever funds we can raise to help support producing this show, and GREATLY appreciate anyone who helps and believes in this projects as much as the people involved do. Your funds will help pay for the sound artists, the visual and audio design team and for the transformation of the space into a cocoon for a roughly hour long piece.This campaign is really more about a process than a product, so we're not offering any specific physical perks for contributing, but asking for support for the project if you are able to and believe in it enough to want to contribute. I will absolutely be writing a personal thank you to everyone who contributes, and other tiers will be thanked in the program additionally. Everyone needs time to breathe, reflect, receive, and connect. Gorintō endeavors to provide an opportunity to indulge in that truth. To allow you to engage in this microcosm and nothing else, and to be fully present, whether that means in yourself, in environment, or within each other.  よろしきお願いします！THANK YOU IN ADVANCE!Even if you are not able to support us financially in this pursuit, please share with others that you know who may be interested and able to!

<h3>The Plan</h3>
<p>We are hoping to raise $2000 by the end of July! That means we only have ONE MONTH to reach our goal!!</p>
<p>We are planning to film this video in early August over one weekend in New York City with a small crew. We could use your help to bring the filmmakers to NYC and for production costs. The video and with an updated recording will premiere sometime this fall.</p>
<h3>Letter From the Songwriter</h3>
<p>This piece of music has been my heart’s song from before I even wrote it down and has taught me so much about myself. When I feel a wave of anxiety or when I feel like my brain and my life is out of control, I remember the voice in my heart that tells me to “Close my eyes and dream of impossible things.” When I am in the midst of depression or whatever is keeping me from living freely, it seems impossible to surface. In that moment I close my eyes, let go, and let love take me to a place where I can overcome fear.</p>
<p>Struggling with depression makes it hard for me to focus on making my own art. This piece of art came from me, it is the most beautiful thing I have shared with myself and I want to give it another voice. This began with a pen and paper, came to life when my brother put it to music, showed itself in a series of drawings I created, and now it wants to be a music video. I want to share this heart song with more people, exploring unforeseeable ends.</p>
<p>May you learn to love with each new sunrise,</p>
<p>Meeka</p>

<h3>Letter from the Director</h3>
<p>Meeka and I have been friends for over 5 years and ever since we became friends, we have always loved collaborating on our art. When she approached me about directing this video I said yes without hesitation. After graduating from film school last year I found it very difficult to find time or inspiration to be creative. Recently I have struggled with wanting to create more and being unable to do so.</p>
<p>Having the opportunity to shoot this music video will fill both of our needs to create and collaborate. We hope that you are inspired by this piece of music like we are and are willing to show us support as we get to live our dreams and hopefully further our careers as artists. </p>

<h2>""All of You""</h2>
<h3>Our First Full Album: New Music for the Movement!</h3>
<p>Hey, I'm Adam Gottlieb, and my band is <strong>Adam Gottlieb &amp; OneLove.</strong> We make <strong>music for the movement</strong>, songs<strong> </strong>inspired by the growing social response to the revolutionary times we are living through, <strong>meant to inspire those who are in the struggles</strong> to secure such basic human rights as<strong> </strong>housing, food, healthcare, clean water, a livable planet, education, and peace and justice in our communities, as well as from the police/justice system, etc. I believe all of us who are struggling are in one way or another fighting for <strong>a new world where peace is the reality of our lives</strong>, where there will be no need for poverty, hunger, pollution, prisons or police. I believe such a world is not only possible, but necessary. And <strong>I believe music is playing an important role</strong> in gathering, galvanizing and inspiring this movement, as it always has.</p>
<p><strong>We are currently finishing up our first full album</strong>, <strong>""All of You,""</strong> <strong>an epically ambitious project</strong> that has truly been a creation not just of our band but of the many voices and visions of this movement who inspired the songs. The band and I started working on the earliest songs with my band when we first formed in the summer of 2014, so in that sense<strong> this album has been over four years in the making.</strong> We began the recording process in early February of 2018, and <strong>we are now in the final stages of recording</strong>: adding finishing touches such as auxiliary percussion, background vocals, audio samples, etc. <strong>We will soon be moving into the mixing and mastering stage, to be followed by distribution, duplication and promotion.​</strong><strong> </strong>All of this takes money, and our budget for the album, which I have been paying for out of pocket, is almost spent (including a $2500 grant we won from the Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs and Special Events for the project!). The cost to make and release this album will be just over <strong>$10,000</strong>, which is the amount that I am attempting to raise with this crowd-funding campaign. Making this amount from donations will allow us to not only secure the resources for finishing the project, but to create a budget for distributing, duplicating, and marketing the album so that we can launch it into the world with as much energy as it deserves!</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Compared to our debut EP that came out last year, ""Cicada Season,""<strong> this new album is a BEAST! </strong>(You might say that if the EP was a cicada, the album is a lion!) ""Cicada Season"" showcased five songs that were eclectic, but all grounded in the basic acoustic folk-rock sound we are rooted in (with reggae and blues overtones). We describe our music in many ways: ""Folk-Hop Fusion,""<strong> </strong>""Modern Folk-Rock,"" ""Folk/Rock/Reggae Fusion with Hip Hop, Funk, and Blues overtones,""<strong> </strong>etc. <strong>""All of You"" will have 12 original songs</strong> with all of the elements that Cicada Season had and more, representing a much wider range of the styles that OneLove blends, including elements of Hip Hop, Funk, Hard Rock, and Ska! It will also feature<strong> live horns</strong> on over half of the songs, as well as <strong>a wide variety of featured vocalists, spoken word artists, instrumentalists, and sound design elements </strong>with audio samples from first-hand interviews and protests/actions we have been involved with. </p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">The horn players from Fatbook who recorded on the album. <i>From left to right: Evan Jacobson, (Trombone), Adam Gottlieb, Anthony Beck (Sound Engineer), Constantine Alexander (Trumpet), Roy McGrath (Tenor Saxophone)</i></p>
<p>Ever since I was a kid, the music that I have loved the most has been music that had both a <strong>contagious energy </strong>and a conscious message expressed through <strong>honest poetry.</strong> I have always believed in the power of such music to change the world. I have a wide range of influences, which are reflected in the eclectic and genre-fusing sound that OneLove delivers. My biggest inspirations have been Bob Marley, The Beatles, Bob Dylan, Sly &amp; The Family Stone, Tracy Chapman, and, more recently, Hip Hop artists such as Lauryn Hill, Flobots, Brother Ali, and Rebel Diaz, as well as modern folk-rock and reggae-fusion artists such as Nahko &amp; Medicine for the People, Wookiefoot, Trevor Hall, Dustin Thomas, and more. <strong>If I can inspire you in your struggle to live up to your full potential - and to push humanity forward by doing so -</strong> the way that these artists have inspired me, then <strong>my time here on earth will not be wasted.</strong></p>
<p>Which brings me to the real meaning of the album's title: ""All of You."" It applies to both the individual and collective level: on the individual level, life demands that you show up with your whole self, with all of YOU. (And this is especially true about the crisis we are living through in these times.) And on the collective level, it will take ALL of us to completely transform the world from the old society to the new one: to create a world where all of us can truly be all of who we truly are. <strong>So</strong> <strong>that's who the album is for, and who the fight itself is for: ""All of You.""</strong></p>

</ul>
<h3> </h3>
<h2><u>The Impact</u></h2>
<p><strong>(What We Mean By #MusicForTheMovement...)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>One beautiful part of the concept of the album is that <strong>we have woven in audio samples from interviews with people responding to the question: ""What is your vision that keeps you going?""</strong> These samples, along with others from first-hand interviews at protests, actions, teach-ins, and other events, form an important theme throughout the album.</li>
<li>
<strong>Many of the songs are intensely personal at the same time as being pointedly political.</strong> ""Under the Viaduct,"" for example, tells the story of a heroic resistance effort led by residents of Tent City, a community of folks seeking refuge under the bridges of Lawrence and Wilson Avenues at Lake Shore Drive in the Uptown Neighborhood of Chicago. They were demanding a real solution to the housing crisis that drove them there, and protesting a City-enforced eviction from the viaducts in September of 2017. I wrote the song at the request of one of the Tent City residents, an unhoused comrade who we were working with in that struggle. The lyrics were inspired by the Psalms, because the evictions took place during the Jewish High Holidays. Audio samples of first-hand interviews from the day their struggle climaxed in a dramatic traffic-shut-down action on Lake Shore Drive are woven into the album version of the song.</li>
<li>
<strong>Two songs on the album, ""Kylo"" and ""Water is Life,"" came directly out of my experiences around traveling to Standing Rock in the fall of 2016</strong> to participate in the resistance against Energy Transfer Partners' Dakota Access Pipeline. The song ""Kylo"" is named after Kylo Prince, one of the Water Protectors we met who were traveling around the country that summer, raising awareness of their struggle and calling on supporters to join the effort. When my partner Diana and I did go up to the resistance camps in Cannonball, ND, that October along with our comrade Brett to cover the story for the People's Tribune, we met up with those same folks again, and interviewed them along with many other Water Protectors. What stood out to me most from that experience was a powerful truth: the resistance demonstrated a kind of unity across national/racial/ethnic and ideological lines unlike any I had seen before; and this kind of unity was also part of the vision - and the prophecies - that inspired so many of the Water Protectors we talked to.</li>
<li>
<strong>""Water is Life"" is a prayer song and a protest song intended to be used by folks in the movement. It features <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QtmZ7UFEzs&amp;t=15s"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Diana Zwinak</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpdvrk0fO20"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">El La Katrina</a> - two powerful women Water Protectors - offering Spoken Word Poetry to complement the repetitive chant of the song's chorus.</strong> It also features vocals from three young children Water Protectors - children of a friend of ours who took her whole family to Standing Rock and is a fierce organizer here in Chicago. It is the longest song on the album at 10 minutes, and is the only song we recorded without a metronome. It is a sacred song.</li>
<li>The single off the album, ""Heart Beat,"" features a unique instrumentation with keys as well as a verse from Chicago emcee-musician <strong><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkdGJ3NDlz8&amp;list=PLajij_mGb6pj1z17fUQKW1NVJ40P-WuAS"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">LO Kari</a></strong>, as well as an excerpt from a poem by Chicago organizer/artist/abolitionist <strong><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AGEvrcIAE0&amp;t=132s"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Ethos</a></strong>, and an excerpt from a ""vision"" interview with Chicago organizer and artist <strong><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hb4eLxgDv6Q"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Damon Williams</a></strong>. It is one of our best songs to play live on the stage, and one of the most powerful songs on the album. </li>
<li>
<strong>The album follows a musical and narrative arc to tell a larger story out of many stories. </strong>Ultimately, it is about a vision of the peaceful world that is possible and necessary. But it is also a story about the destruction of our planet and of our society in this age of late capitalism. So many issues are touched on: homelessness, police violence, genocide, the oil market, war, global warming, environmental destruction, sexism/patriarchy, racism, violation of indigenous treaties/sovereignty, water contamination, school closings, and more. But the album begins and ends decisively on a high note - <strong>it is meant to inspire with the power of our common vision.</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So you see, when we say ""music for the movement,"" we don't simply mean songs about social issues. We mean music that is part of a permanent dialogue with, and struggle alongside, our brothers and sisters and comrades fighting for a decent life. Many of the songs on this album are about<strong> real events and people</strong> who you may or may not have heard about, but who are practical leaders in battles over housing, environmental justice, police and prison reform/abolition, clean water, a livable planet, peace, and many other issues. All of these fronts of struggle are part of what we mean by ""the movement."" By supporting this project, you are supporting our effort to not only help tell the stories of these struggles, but to give the music back to the movement itself as an offering. <strong>We believe music has the power to uplift the spirits of people in struggle all over the world and inspire the next generation of revolutionaries.</strong></p>

<h3>Timeline, Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p><strong>We are almost finished with the project</strong>, so at this point it is basically as certain as just about anything is certain that we are going to finish it! (G-d willing!!). The main risk/challenge at this point is simply that the project - and the release - get slowed down and pushed back further due to normal kinds of scheduling challenges. A million factors limit how much time we can book at Audio Warrior Productions studio each week where we are recording and working on the album with our sound engineer, Anthony Beck. Because making an album of this kind is such an intensive and time-consuming process, and because everyone involved is busy hustling to survive (#capitalism), it has been difficult to meet our intended deadlines for each stage of the process, but we keep pushing forward and adjusting as needed.</p>
<p>We have already had to push back the expected release from October to November - and we are prepared to push it back further than that if necessary, but <strong>we will not sacrifice the quality of the music for an earlier release date!</strong> In the long run, the release date is not what matters - what matters is the music on the record, that we hope will last forever. So we want to do it right.</p>
<p>Other than that, and barring emergencies, there are really no significant risks or obstacles at this point!</p>

Our First Full Album: New Music for the Movement!
Hey, I'm Adam Gottlieb, and my band is Adam Gottlieb & OneLove. We make music for the movement, songs inspired by the growing social response to the revolutionary times we are living through, meant to inspire those who are in the struggles to secure such basic human rights as housing, food, healthcare, clean water, a livable planet, education, and peace and justice in our communities, as well as from the police/justice system, etc. I believe all of us who are struggling are in one way or another fighting for a new world where peace is the reality of our lives, where there will be no need for poverty, hunger, pollution, prisons or police. I believe such a world is not only possible, but necessary. And I believe music is playing an important role in gathering, galvanizing and inspiring this movement, as it always has.
We are currently finishing up our first full album, ""All of You,"" an epically ambitious project that has truly been a creation not just of our band but of the many voices and visions of this movement who inspired the songs. The band and I started working on the earliest songs with my band when we first formed in the summer of 2014, so in that sense this album has been over four years in the making. We began the recording process in early February of 2018, and we are now in the final stages of recording: adding finishing touches such as auxiliary percussion, background vocals, audio samples, etc. We will soon be moving into the mixing and mastering stage, to be followed by distribution, duplication and promotion.​ All of this takes money, and our budget for the album, which I have been paying for out of pocket, is almost spent (including a $2500 grant we won from the Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs and Special Events for the project!). The cost to make and release this album will be just over $10,000, which is the amount that I am attempting to raise with this crowd-funding campaign. Making this amount from donations will allow us to not only secure the resources for finishing the project, but to create a budget for distributing, duplicating, and marketing the album so that we can launch it into the world with as much energy as it deserves!

The photo collage that will serve as the foundation for the artwork (in progress) for ""All of You""
 
Compared to our debut EP that came out last year, ""Cicada Season,"" this new album is a BEAST! (You might say that if the EP was a cicada, the album is a lion!) ""Cicada Season"" showcased five songs that were eclectic, but all grounded in the basic acoustic folk-rock sound we are rooted in (with reggae and blues overtones). We describe our music in many ways: ""Folk-Hop Fusion,"" ""Modern Folk-Rock,"" ""Folk/Rock/Reggae Fusion with Hip Hop, Funk, and Blues overtones,"" etc. ""All of You"" will have 12 original songs with all of the elements that Cicada Season had and more, representing a much wider range of the styles that OneLove blends, including elements of Hip Hop, Funk, Hard Rock, and Ska! It will also feature live horns on over half of the songs, as well as a wide variety of featured vocalists, spoken word artists, instrumentalists, and sound design elements with audio samples from first-hand interviews and protests/actions we have been involved with.

Ever since I was a kid, the music that I have loved the most has been music that had both a contagious energy and a conscious message expressed through honest poetry. I have always believed in the power of such music to change the world. I have a wide range of influences, which are reflected in the eclectic and genre-fusing sound that OneLove delivers. My biggest inspirations have been Bob Marley, The Beatles, Bob Dylan, Sly & The Family Stone, Tracy Chapman, and, more recently, Hip Hop artists such as Lauryn Hill, Flobots, Brother Ali, and Rebel Diaz, as well as modern folk-rock and reggae-fusion artists such as Nahko & Medicine for the People, Wookiefoot, Trevor Hall, Dustin Thomas, and more. If I can inspire you in your struggle to live up to your full potential - and to push humanity forward by doing so - the way that these artists have inspired me, then my time here on earth will not be wasted.
Which brings me to the real meaning of the album's title: ""All of You."" It applies to both the individual and collective level: on the individual level, life demands that you show up with your whole self, with all of YOU. (And this is especially true about the crisis we are living through in these times.) And on the collective level, it will take ALL of us to completely transform the world from the old society to the new one: to create a world where all of us can truly be all of who we truly are. So that's who the album is for, and who the fight itself is for: ""All of You.""

The Impact
(What We Mean By #MusicForTheMovement...)

One beautiful part of the concept of the album is that we have woven in audio samples from interviews with people responding to the question: ""What is your vision that keeps you going?"" These samples, along with others from first-hand interviews at protests, actions, teach-ins, and other events, form an important theme throughout the album.

Many of the songs are intensely personal at the same time as being pointedly political. ""Under the Viaduct,"" for example, tells the story of a heroic resistance effort led by residents of Tent City, a community of folks seeking refuge under the bridges of Lawrence and Wilson Avenues at Lake Shore Drive in the Uptown Neighborhood of Chicago. They were demanding a real solution to the housing crisis that drove them there, and protesting a City-enforced eviction from the viaducts in September of 2017. I wrote the song at the request of one of the Tent City residents, an unhoused comrade who we were working with in that struggle. The lyrics were inspired by the Psalms, because the evictions took place during the Jewish High Holidays. Audio samples of first-hand interviews from the day their struggle climaxed in a dramatic traffic-shut-down action on Lake Shore Drive are woven into the album version of the song.

Two songs on the album, ""Kylo"" and ""Water is Life,"" came directly out of my experiences around traveling to Standing Rock in the fall of 2016 to participate in the resistance against Energy Transfer Partners' Dakota Access Pipeline. The song ""Kylo"" is named after Kylo Prince, one of the Water Protectors we met who were traveling around the country that summer, raising awareness of their struggle and calling on supporters to join the effort. When my partner Diana and I did go up to the resistance camps in Cannonball, ND, that October along with our comrade Brett to cover the story for the People's Tribune, we met up with those same folks again, and interviewed them along with many other Water Protectors. What stood out to me most from that experience was a powerful truth: the resistance demonstrated a kind of unity across national/racial/ethnic and ideological lines unlike any I had seen before; and this kind of unity was also part of the vision - and the prophecies - that inspired so many of the Water Protectors we talked to.

""Water is Life"" is a prayer song and a protest song intended to be used by folks in the movement. It features Diana Zwinak and El La Katrina - two powerful women Water Protectors - offering Spoken Word Poetry to complement the repetitive chant of the song's chorus. It also features vocals from three young children Water Protectors - children of a friend of ours who took her whole family to Standing Rock and is a fierce organizer here in Chicago. It is the longest song on the album at 10 minutes, and is the only song we recorded without a metronome. It is a sacred song.
The single off the album, ""Heart Beat,"" features a unique instrumentation with keys as well as a verse from Chicago emcee-musician LO Kari, as well as an excerpt from a poem by Chicago organizer/artist/abolitionist Ethos, and an excerpt from a ""vision"" interview with Chicago organizer and artist Damon Williams. It is one of our best songs to play live on the stage, and one of the most powerful songs on the album. 

The album follows a musical and narrative arc to tell a larger story out of many stories. Ultimately, it is about a vision of the peaceful world that is possible and necessary. But it is also a story about the destruction of our planet and of our society in this age of late capitalism. So many issues are touched on: homelessness, police violence, genocide, the oil market, war, global warming, environmental destruction, sexism/patriarchy, racism, violation of indigenous treaties/sovereignty, water contamination, school closings, and more. But the album begins and ends decisively on a high note - it is meant to inspire with the power of our common vision.


So you see, when we say ""music for the movement,"" we don't simply mean songs about social issues. We mean music that is part of a permanent dialogue with, and struggle alongside, our brothers and sisters and comrades fighting for a decent life. Many of the songs on this album are about real events and people who you may or may not have heard about, but who are practical leaders in battles over housing, environmental justice, police and prison reform/abolition, clean water, a livable planet, peace, and many other issues. All of these fronts of struggle are part of what we mean by ""the movement."" By supporting this project, you are supporting our effort to not only help tell the stories of these struggles, but to give the music back to the movement itself as an offering. We believe music has the power to uplift the spirits of people in struggle all over the world and inspire the next generation of revolutionaries.

You can also check out the other videos attached to this campaign! And one more very special thing. I am really amazed at what one of my fans, Ben Eicher, wrote about my stop in Chadron, Nebraska for the People's Tribune. You can read his article here.

<h3>Juli Keown Music</h3>
<p><i><strong>Fireweed Impressions</strong></i> is my debut album.</p>
<p>I’m a singer-songwriter from Southeast Alaska and my grandparents are my biggest inspiration. They formed several bands, throughout my childhood, playing around southeast Alaska and Sweden.</p>
<p>I spent 6 years living in Austin, TX, playing live shows, tuning into my voice, style and befriending some extraordinary musicians. There have been years of preparing to record this album. <strong>The only thing needed now are the funds</strong>. That’s where you and this campaign come in to play.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Dollar Bills</h3>
<p>I spend my <strong>summers working</strong> in my home town, Hoonah, Alaska. My mother owns a northwest coast art gallery and is an artist herself. I make jewelry and help her with the store as well as her natural Alaskan botanicals line, Tlingit Botanicals. </p>
<p>I have saved enough to front the <strong>smaller expenses</strong> (travel, housing, rehearsal space, gear, etc.) myself but I still need help raising money for the actual <strong>studio time and paying friends, artist, and musicians</strong> who contribute their time. </p>
<p>I'm asking for <strong>$9250</strong>. The funds I am able to raise dictate the amount of time I can spend in the studio and the number of musicians that will be involve in creating Fireweed Impressions as well as the amount of soul there will be room for on the album. </p>
<p>I could easily put $9250 to good use, so <strong>dream big with me</strong> and let's see what happens. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Designed by Yours Truly</h3>
<p>I have started my design work, getting inspired by the Fireweed Impressions album concept. As a backer you can <strong>contribute however much you would like</strong>. There is also the option to choose a <strong>perk package</strong>. I will be designing all kinds of fun merch for you!</p>
<p>Perk Items Include:</p>
<p>-Pre-Release Album Downloads and Signed Physical Copies</p>
<p>-Limited Edition Posters</p>
<p>-Fireweed Impressions Album T-shirts and Totes</p>
<p>-Stickers, Buttons, Patches</p>
<p>-Limited Edition Lyric and Artwork Book</p>
<p>-Cover Songs Chosen by YOU</p>
<p>-Intimate House Concerts</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>

<p>Last spring, I successfully booked and executed a solo tour. It was a lot of hard work and though it still fell short of what my dreams could see, it was exactly what need to be. I ended up driving from Portland Oregon, down to Austin, Tx, up to Boston and then all the back around. I booked dozens of shows and by the end of my journey I had driven 16,000 miles and played 42 venues. </p>
<p>I am only human, and all humans face setbacks. I can assure you, for this album, I am prepared. If anything were to come up, you would be the first to know as my backers.</p>
<p>I've been making music and art as a lifestyle for 10 years and I am not planning on stopping anytime soon. Join me on this musical, cultural adventure, its been a great ride so far.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Share, Share, Share</h3>
<p><strong>PEASE</strong> share, share, share. It goes a long ways to share on social media and by mouth. Follow my pages and pass around this Indiegogo Campaign (Indiegogo has convenient share tools right at the top of this page!) <strong>Help me make some noise!</strong> </p>

I spend my summers working in my home town, Hoonah, Alaska. My mother owns a northwest coast art gallery and is an artist herself. I make jewelry and help her with the store as well as her natural Alaskan botanicals line, Tlingit Botanicals. 
I have saved enough to front the smaller expenses (travel, housing, rehearsal space, gear, etc.) myself but I still need help raising money for the actual studio time and paying friends, artist, and musicians who contribute their time. 
I'm asking for $9250. The funds I am able to raise dictate the amount of time I can spend in the studio and the number of musicians that will be involve in creating Fireweed Impressions as well as the amount of soul there will be room for on the album. 
I could easily put $9250 to good use, so dream big with me and let's see what happens. 

Designed by Yours Truly
I have started my design work, getting inspired by the Fireweed Impressions album concept. As a backer you can contribute however much you would like. There is also the option to choose a perk package. I will be designing all kinds of fun merch for you!
Perk Items Include:
-Pre-Release Album Downloads and Signed Physical Copies

-Limited Edition Lyric and Artwork Book
-Cover Songs Chosen by YOU

Risks & Challenges

Last spring, I successfully booked and executed a solo tour. It was a lot of hard work and though it still fell short of what my dreams could see, it was exactly what need to be. I ended up driving from Portland Oregon, down to Austin, Tx, up to Boston and then all the back around. I booked dozens of shows and by the end of my journey I had driven 16,000 miles and played 42 venues. 
I am only human, and all humans face setbacks. I can assure you, for this album, I am prepared. If anything were to come up, you would be the first to know as my backers.
I've been making music and art as a lifestyle for 10 years and I am not planning on stopping anytime soon. Join me on this musical, cultural adventure, its been a great ride so far.

<h3>THE PROJECT</h3>
<p><strong>Our goal </strong>with this album is to bring to light, and continue discussing, many of the different social, political, and economic issues inciting chaos and violence around the world today. The album will also explore how the COVID-19 pandemic has exponentially exacerbated these issues.</p>
<p>We are excited to be collaborating with PARMA Recordings and the Janáček Philharmonic Orchestra to create an album that will feature the masterful and diverse talents of its extraordinary guest artists and orchestra, culminating in the digital premiere of composer Josh Trentadue's ambitious first symphony! Recording will tentatively be taking place during the summer of 2021 in the Czech Republic; the postproduction required following these sessions will culminate in a tentative album release date for sometime in 2022.*</p>
<p>You will experience a wide and eclectic variety of music in this album - from contemporary orchestral and electronic elements (harkening back to the greater traditions of epic film music), to progressive post-bop jazz (featuring extravagant improvisations from its six-player combo), to contemporary flute music (challenging the instrument’s technical, lyrical, and idiomatic capabilities, brilliantly performed by our solo flutist), to therapeutic and spiritual, meditative healing that will soothe and calm the soul. There is something to be found at all corners of this album that everyone can enjoy.</p>
<p>We hope that you will take a moment to donate to this important cause. Your support of this campaign will tremendously help with the expenses required to produce this album, create this music in a live performance setting, and bring this important and necessary art to life during a critically turbulent moment for the greater fine arts community. As we continue to circumvent this pandemic, the fight for systemic change, justice, equality, and peace must continue. With this album, we continue to advocate for these things through this diverse and artistic platform, bridging traditional and contemporary music together with experimental and immersive experiences that can be enjoyed by all audiences for generations to come.<br/><br/>LEARN MORE: <a href=""https://www.motifsymphonyone.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.motifsymphonyone.com</a></p>

<h3>THE RISKS &amp; CHALLENGES</h3>
<p>All of us involved in this recording project brings to the table years of professional performance (in both solo and ensemble/group settings), production, and recording experience. We continue to remain active in our individual musical endeavors as much as possible in an increasingly persistent, ever-changing climate. This album represents the first phase of our collective collaboration, in which all of us combines our efforts and passion together to bring to life art that will not only challenge every single one of our beliefs, but also continue important conversations that must continue to be discussed in our greater community. In addition to this recording project, the composer and guest artists are working together to create a version of this symphony for wind ensemble, commissioned by Jeff Herwig and the Three Rivers Wind Symphony as part of a consortium. The world premiere of this version is scheduled to occur on December 9, 2021.</p>
<p>With that being said, the greatest risk to this recording project is the threat of the COVID-19 pandemic. All of us are coming together from various locations in the United States to record this album in the Czech Republic. We do not know what the global, social, and economic climate will look like by the time recording is scheduled to take place. Please know that we are all taking every single precaution possible throughout every single aspect of the completion of this recording project in order to avoid even the slightest risk of COVID-19.</p>
<p>We have the tools, focus, caliber, and attention to detail to create the professionally recorded, high quality music required for this album, this symphony, and its overall concepts. Our collaboration with PARMA Recordings and the Janáček Philharmonic Orchestra will continue to ensure the highest standards of excellence, artistry, musicianship, and craft required for this recording project and this symphony.<br/> </p>

<h3>Hey all!</h3>
<p>My name is Maya Wagner and I am a musical artist getting ready to release a new EP for pride month (June 2021). The EP tells the story of my experience getting into a relationship doomed by society's stigmas and prejudice against the LGBTQ community. The story is one of tragedy, but of course, it is of empowerment and hope as well. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Marketing is Hard</h3>
<p>With online distribution and social media, anyone can make music out into the world. However, with so many marketing resources, it can become overwhelming to do it all on your own. My producer HILLOC and I thought it would be a great idea hire music marketing specialists to help get my kick-ass music out into the world. I have a message that I want to be heard, but I can't make it heard all on my own. </p>
<p>The funds raised in this campaign will be put directly towards marketing my EP. </p>

</div></div>","Hey all!
My name is Maya Wagner and I am a musical artist getting ready to release a new EP for pride month (June 2021). The EP tells the story of my experience getting into a relationship doomed by society's stigmas and prejudice against the LGBTQ community. The story is one of tragedy, but of course, it is of empowerment and hope as well. 

Marketing is Hard
With online distribution and social media, anyone can make music out into the world. However, with so many marketing resources, it can become overwhelming to do it all on your own. My producer HILLOC and I thought it would be a great idea hire music marketing specialists to help get my kick-ass music out into the world. I have a message that I want to be heard, but I can't make it heard all on my own. 
The funds raised in this campaign will be put directly towards marketing my EP.

<p><strong>Любишь Псоя? Поддержи “ХРОНИКИ АНАЛОГОВОЙ ЖИЗНИ”! </strong></p>

<p>В 2019 году мы с вашей помощью выпустили альбом песен Ольги Чикиной “Всё не так, как кажется” с её чудесными рисунками. Олю вы встретите и на новом альбоме, как соавтора переводов, исполнителя некоторых песен и, конечно, художника-иллюстратора. </p>

<p>Музыкальным продюсером альбома будет, как и в тот раз, Федор Чистяков, основатель группы “Ноль”, легенда русского рок-н-ролла. В его лихих, забойных, и в то же время замысловатых, мастерских аранжировках французский шансон и Псой Короленко зазвучат совсем по-новому. </p>

<p>Кто-то помнит советскую грампластинку “Поет Ги Беар” 1972 года, включавшую песню ""Эх, дороги"" на русском языке. Большинство песен Ги Беара  написаны в 60-70-х, они передают  уникальный дух того времени. Отсюда название. </p>

<p><strong>Who are we, and what do we bring to the table?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Rändi Fay (lyricist and vocalist) is a former veterinarian who began her professional songwriting and performing career at age 50, her strongest musical influences being jazz, 60’s &amp; 70’s classic hits, music theater and classical music.</li>
<li>Aaron Zinsmeister (composer, producer, synths &amp; orchestration) has a degree in music and recording technology, and has played in bands since his teens with influences from symphonic metal to video game soundtracks to classical orchestration.</li>
<li>From this award winning, dynamic pair a dramatic new genre has emerged that blends the best of their creativity: symphonic electronica.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1568310025/jsfub0cuxa6dnewncgvp.png"" src=""""/></strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>""The lead single from her upcoming album Intuition, 'Lone Wolf' is symphonic and haunting, conjuring the electricity of new romance while tackling the fear of vulnerability and the challenge of building trust as the relationship shifts from infatuation to love.""​  </i></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><a href=""http://bit.ly/2nWSfjW"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>-Music Update Central, 9.30.19</i></a></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p><strong>Why is this exciting?</strong>  The drama, shifts and textures of symphonic electronica cross the boundaries of generations and genre, exploring human emotion with no holds barred. Rändi’s poetic lyrics play, dig and bite, supported by Aaron’s expressive melodies, complex harmonies and rich orchestrations. Popular music does not need to be cookie cutter, and these songs break the mold!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Why is this project important?</strong> People have become disconnected. Media and technology send confusing, alienating and often de-humanizing messages to all of us. In response we become numb, isolating ourselves from experiencing insecurity and fear, but from each other as well.  The songs of “Intuition” explore facing this fear of connection, exposing who we are at our core, learning to trust ourselves to have the courage to to feel afraid, to be empowered, to take a chance and to love. This message, communicated in vivid, colorful textures and sounds, is what makes ""Intuition"" an important and timely album.</p>

<p><strong>What's with the Firefly? </strong>A firefly is an almost mythical creature, a blend of poetry, science, mystery and instinct. But fireflies are in danger, as light pollution threatens their ability to communicate- the ""noise"" of the night sky is affecting their ability to find their mate. What a perfect metaphor for “Intuition.” If we can’t find our own light through all of the noise, how can shine and find others? Finding ourselves is key to finding love…</p>

</div></div>","Who are we, and what do we bring to the table?

Rändi Fay (lyricist and vocalist) is a former veterinarian who began her professional songwriting and performing career at age 50, her strongest musical influences being jazz, 60’s & 70’s classic hits, music theater and classical music.
Aaron Zinsmeister (composer, producer, synths & orchestration) has a degree in music and recording technology, and has played in bands since his teens with influences from symphonic metal to video game soundtracks to classical orchestration.
From this award winning, dynamic pair a dramatic new genre has emerged that blends the best of their creativity: symphonic electronica.

 

""The lead single from her upcoming album Intuition, 'Lone Wolf' is symphonic and haunting, conjuring the electricity of new romance while tackling the fear of vulnerability and the challenge of building trust as the relationship shifts from infatuation to love.""​  
-Music Update Central, 9.30.19
 
Why is this exciting?  The drama, shifts and textures of symphonic electronica cross the boundaries of generations and genre, exploring human emotion with no holds barred. Rändi’s poetic lyrics play, dig and bite, supported by Aaron’s expressive melodies, complex harmonies and rich orchestrations. Popular music does not need to be cookie cutter, and these songs break the mold!
 
Why is this project important? People have become disconnected. Media and technology send confusing, alienating and often de-humanizing messages to all of us. In response we become numb, isolating ourselves from experiencing insecurity and fear, but from each other as well.  The songs of “Intuition” explore facing this fear of connection, exposing who we are at our core, learning to trust ourselves to have the courage to to feel afraid, to be empowered, to take a chance and to love. This message, communicated in vivid, colorful textures and sounds, is what makes ""Intuition"" an important and timely album.
 

“There is a market for sensuality emboldened in such a veiled classy way, there are so many audiences of women who are going to feel validated, and I really love that. “​   -Laura Anne Henderson, professional photographer & fan
 
What's with the Firefly? A firefly is an almost mythical creature, a blend of poetry, science, mystery and instinct. But fireflies are in danger, as light pollution threatens their ability to communicate- the ""noise"" of the night sky is affecting their ability to find their mate. What a perfect metaphor for “Intuition.” If we can’t find our own light through all of the noise, how can shine and find others? Finding ourselves is key to finding love…

We’ve made arrangements for piano trio of pieces by Lili Boulanger, Nadia Boulanger, Debussy, even a Vincent Scotto song made famous by Josephine Baker; we’re playing a movement of Mel Bonis’ trio as well. You’ll also hear the familiar movements of Ravel Trio scattered throughout.

<p>Music City Strings is a community of students, teachers, and
parents who believe in the importance of an enriched and
thorough music education. In 2005, Dana Meyer, International
concert violinist and violist, established Music City Strings in
Franklin, Tennessee. Her dream was to create a program that
would provide children the means to become confident,
sensitive and beautiful artists. As her studio demands grew she
invited Frank Auer, a violinist and teacher from Franklin, to be a
co-director of the program. Today, that program consists of 45
young students in violin and viola, ranging from beginner to
advanced levels. Ages range from four to eighteen years old,
with many siblings, parents, and grandparents participating in
everyday scheduled events. </p>

<p><span style=""font-weight: normal; line-height: 26px;""></span></p>
<p>Over the years I have a grown a lot. Actually, a lot is an understatement. Looking at who I am now compared to who I used to be, I'm an entirely different person. The transformations I've gone through over the years have been personal, professional, and spiritual  - ranging from a change in my musical direction, to run-ins with the law and police raids, giving up meat and dairy completely to embrace a plant based diet, swearing that I would never get married... and then getting married, to most important of all, my spiritual transformation: getting baptized in the Atlantic Ocean and becoming a follower of Christ. For the first time in my life, I have absolute confidence in the path I'm on and the direction I'm headed. What I ask for is your involvement to get me to my destination.</p>
<p></p>
<h3></h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1426020/files/20150429094549-placements.jpg?1430325949"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Why I'm Doing This</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Although I’ve landed some pretty awesome placements on TV and film, (check out those images above, I've had my music in all that stuff) I’ve never really been able to reach an audience and make a difference - my ultimate goal. Having my songs in TV shows and commercials is really cool and I’m grateful for each opportunity, it has however been a catch 22: looks great on my resume, but no one knows it’s my music!</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>And that’s why I’m redirecting my focus and getting you involved. I’ve got to get the word out. My old strategy (""I can do everything by myself and don't need help from anyone"") doesn’t work. It’s also not fun doing everything by myself! </p>
<br/><h3>My Impact </h3>
<p></p>
<p>Music is a powerful tool and I don’t want to squander the gifts I’ve been given on selfish achievements. No longer separating my faith from my career, I can fill an area of the EDM market I don’t see at the mainstream level. With your support, I’ll be able to reach a large audience who are on the fringe of a relationship with God. This is a great opportunity for me to be light to others and actually make a big difference. I get excited about excelling with a higher purpose in mind. </p>
<p>That being said, I'm fully aware of a majority who find this a meaningless afterthought... it’s strictly about the music. And with respect to the latter, I completely agree - the music has to be excellent. I don't expect anyone to listen to something that isn’t good. And if that sounds like you, don't worry! I've got you covered. The tracks I've made for this EP blow everything else I’ve done out of the water. I don't have it in my bones to put out a mediocre product! </p>
<br/><p></p>
<ul>
</ul> </div> <div> <h3>What it Takes to Make this Happen</h3>
<div><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;""></span></p></div>
<p>I've assembled an incredible team who can make this EP a real success. All the key people are in place, I just need to pay them so they can to do their jobs. In order to do that, I need to raise $25,000. Below is a detailed breakdown of my budget and how your contributions will be spent:</p>
<div>$9,000 - Marketing, Promotion &amp; PR.</div>
<div>$5,500 - Music video</div>
<div>$3000 - Mixing &amp; Mastering</div>
<div>$3000 - Merchandise Manufacturing </div>
<div>$1000 - Legal fees</div>
<div>$500 - Artwork/graphic design</div>
<div>$500 - Photos </div>

<div>$2000 - IndieGoGo's cut + 3rd party CC processing</div>

</div>
</div><div> <p></p>
</div><p>Asking for help has never been something I've been comfortable with, let alone good at. But, I know that I can't do this on my own. One thing I am good  at however, is achieving goals that I set for myself. I don't quit when I set my mind to something and I certainly won't give this project anything less than 100% of my effort. </p>
<p>
</p><p>When you contribute to my campaign, your impact is profound. Not only does it mean the world to me, but it gives me the fuel I need to get the ball rolling - often the biggest hurdle in crowd funding. People’s confidence builds when they see others getting involved and follow their lead. Your contribution makes a BIG difference in reaching my goal, so I encourage you to jump in and swim… the water is warm!</p><p><br/></p><p></p><h3>STRETCH GOALS!!!!</h3><p>If I over-fund my campaign, here's what I'll use the extra dough for:</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431917217/pb57vekalyd87iawmupo.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431917468/onru7lvyedf6vpcryye5.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431917484/takwshpzmk4x03qfjq5g.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431917632/apmqn93eaa99krihv4sk.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431917537/pjoornoisq6pg83igmfa.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>If I raise $100,000, I will hand-write the entire Bible and document the experience.

</div><div>Thank you!</div><div>-Ozwald Bozwald</div><div><br/></div></div>","My Transformation

Over the years I have a grown a lot. Actually, a lot is an understatement. Looking at who I am now compared to who I used to be, I'm an entirely different person. The transformations I've gone through over the years have been personal, professional, and spiritual  - ranging from a change in my musical direction, to run-ins with the law and police raids, giving up meat and dairy completely to embrace a plant based diet, swearing that I would never get married... and then getting married, to most important of all, my spiritual transformation: getting baptized in the Atlantic Ocean and becoming a follower of Christ. For the first time in my life, I have absolute confidence in the path I'm on and the direction I'm headed. What I ask for is your involvement to get me to my destination.




Why I'm Doing This

Although I’ve landed some pretty awesome placements on TV and film, (check out those images above, I've had my music in all that stuff) I’ve never really been able to reach an audience and make a difference - my ultimate goal. Having my songs in TV shows and commercials is really cool and I’m grateful for each opportunity, it has however been a catch 22: looks great on my resume, but no one knows it’s my music!


And that’s why I’m redirecting my focus and getting you involved. I’ve got to get the word out. My old strategy (""I can do everything by myself and don't need help from anyone"") doesn’t work. It’s also not fun doing everything by myself! 
My Impact 

Music is a powerful tool and I don’t want to squander the gifts I’ve been given on selfish achievements. No longer separating my faith from my career, I can fill an area of the EDM market I don’t see at the mainstream level. With your support, I’ll be able to reach a large audience who are on the fringe of a relationship with God. This is a great opportunity for me to be light to others and actually make a big difference. I get excited about excelling with a higher purpose in mind. 
That being said, I'm fully aware of a majority who find this a meaningless afterthought... it’s strictly about the music. And with respect to the latter, I completely agree - the music has to be excellent. I don't expect anyone to listen to something that isn’t good. And if that sounds like you, don't worry! I've got you covered. The tracks I've made for this EP blow everything else I’ve done out of the water. I don't have it in my bones to put out a mediocre product! 


   What it Takes to Make this Happen

I've assembled an incredible team who can make this EP a real success. All the key people are in place, I just need to pay them so they can to do their jobs. In order to do that, I need to raise $25,000. Below is a detailed breakdown of my budget and how your contributions will be spent:
$9,000 - Marketing, Promotion & PR.
$5,500 - Music video
$3000 - Mixing & Mastering
$3000 - Merchandise Manufacturing 
$1000 - Legal fees
$500 - Artwork/graphic design
$500 - Photos 
$500 - Shipping expenses & Postage
$2000 - IndieGoGo's cut + 3rd party CC processing





What Do You Get in Return? AWESOME STUFF!

In exchange for your generosity, I’ve put together twenty awesome perks for you. Some include merchandise and others are fun experiences relating to things I love to do. 
***Every perk includes a high-quality digital download of the Transform EP.***










My Challenges & Your Impact


 
Asking for help has never been something I've been comfortable with, let alone good at. But, I know that I can't do this on my own. One thing I am good  at however, is achieving goals that I set for myself. I don't quit when I set my mind to something and I certainly won't give this project anything less than 100% of my effort. 

When you contribute to my campaign, your impact is profound. Not only does it mean the world to me, but it gives me the fuel I need to get the ball rolling - often the biggest hurdle in crowd funding. People’s confidence builds when they see others getting involved and follow their lead. Your contribution makes a BIG difference in reaching my goal, so I encourage you to jump in and swim… the water is warm!STRETCH GOALS!!!!If I over-fund my campaign, here's what I'll use the extra dough for:If I raise $100,000, I will hand-write the entire Bible and document the experience. If someone bought the $15K perk I will be writing the Bible for them, however If no one buys that perk and I still raise $100K, I will handwrite the bible anyway, film the experience and make a documentary about it. When the Bible is complete I will auction it off and give all the money to charity. I would really love to do this! 3 More Ways You Can Get Involved!

<p><strong>What Is 'Give Voice'? ~</strong></p>
<p>'Give Voice' is my 2nd record and a very special project for charity.  I want to provide support and inspiration for those struggling with a major life challenge.  The songs I've written are inspired by different people that have something to voice but can't for one reason or another; a mute and deaf boy in a wheel chair, an Afghanistan girl who committed suicide as a protest for her freedom and a 9-year old boy with Autism. My mission is to create music to make a positive difference in the world.  </p>
<p>With this project, I plan on connecting each song with a respective charity such as Autism Speaks, The American Foundation for Disabled Children and Suicide Awareness Voices of Education and donate all the record sales proceeds to them.  I look to be involved with and create benefit performances and events for these charities and have these songs represent their cause.  I will reach out as far as I can so this record can have the impact it is intended to have.  I have also created a Give Voice Outreach Program which includes a music program for Autistic and special needs kids.   Either through lyric writing, melody creation or singing their own composition with the help of a trained team of music therapist and professional composer/vocalist, students will get to express their inner voice and personal story. We are working on implementing this program in various Autism Centers in the US.  If you give to this project, you will be involved from the ground level with something very special.  You will help others feel a connection through the power of music where they can hear their struggle and emotional life resonating in a song. Together, we can make a difference and give back with give voice.</p>

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Hi everyone!  I’m Carla Bianco and music is something I've been doing my whole life. I was born in a small town outside of Pittsburgh to immigrant Italian parents who understandably feared the hardships that come with a musician's life.  I had to be a disciplined motivating
force for myself and take great leaps of faith toward a dream. My first gig was at 4 years old singing at a neighbor's graduation party where guests filled a Styrofoam cup with money.  I ran all the way home and thought 'this is pretty cool. maybe I could do this for the rest of my life'.  After hearing the sound of a piano in a Tom and Jerry cartoon, I felt a calling to play the instrument.  I taught myself how to play with my brother's </span>accordian book &amp; started writing songs at age 10.  <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> I moved to NYC at age 20 on a wing and a

of ups and downs that have led me to this point in my career and life.  This ranged from working with the best people in the music business one moment to not being able
to pay my rent the next.  Leaving NY for LA because there were no jobs after 9/11  to writing a Billboard #1 song.  From starring
on Broadway to coming home and giving back to my community by helping to start a performing
arts center.  Realizing
after everything I had been through, I had never written and released a record
which was what I always wanted to do.  So
in 2012, I self-released my first album, ‘All This Time’ and released the
record in 2014 distributed by BFD/Sony Red. 
The record has created quite the buzz in the indie music scene with numerous reviews in international entertainment blogs, shows opening for artists like Kenny Loggins and achieving many chart placements and recognitions.  </span></p>
<p>With my first record out there and a dream fulfilled, I got deeper into my spirituality and stronger in my beliefs of what I think
really matters during this short time here on this planet. And it all came down to Love; giving Love, healing, spreading light to others in whatever way possible. I got more involved with different
charities like Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, Camp Southern Ground, Playing for Change
Foundation, The American Lung Association and Toys for Tots performing and
donating proceeds in an effort to help in any way I could.  I am inspired to continue my charitable efforts with you through the 'Give Voice' project.</p>

</h3>
<p>Hello. My name is Joseph Gimbel. During the past 25 year, my wife Judy and my avocation has been to pass on the legacy of great classical music to our young people. For the past 8 years, I have served as a competition director focusing my efforts on conservatory bound young artists. Judy and I have gotten to work closely with a number of these talented and committed young people and seen first-hand the support they need during this stressful times in their lives; entering competitions, preparing for conservatory auditions and transitioning to the role of student at a top performance school.</p>
<p>We created <b>Young Artist Performances, Inc</b>., a 501(c)(3) public charity, to help these young people achieve their dreams of becoming  professional classical artists.  This year we have selected 4 nationally recognized musicians and invited them for  performance weekends on Hilton Head Island, where they will perform a program of great classical works for a knowledgeable and supportive audience.  We provide, meals, housing a professional accompanist, video and audio recordings and a post-concert reception in their honor.  We find them at least one additional performance venue during their stay, where they may perform their program a second time.  The weekend affords them a glimpse of the demands and rewards that a professional performance career brings.</p>
<p>Local donations for these concerts cover only a portion of our expenses.  The goal of our campaign is to provide each of these young artists with a full professional fee which they may use toward career development. If you wish, you may direct your donation to a <b>particular artist</b> by posting a private comment (button near top of the page), or emailing us at: <a href=""YAP@gimbelassociates.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""mailto:yap@gimbelassociates.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">YAP@gimbelassociates.com</a><br/></p>

Hello. My name is Joseph Gimbel. During the past 25 year, my wife Judy and my avocation has been to pass on the legacy of great classical music to our young people. For the past 8 years, I have served as a competition director focusing my efforts on conservatory bound young artists. Judy and I have gotten to work closely with a number of these talented and committed young people and seen first-hand the support they need during this stressful times in their lives; entering competitions, preparing for conservatory auditions and transitioning to the role of student at a top performance school.
We created Young Artist Performances, Inc., a 501(c)(3) public charity, to help these young people achieve their dreams of becoming  professional classical artists.  This year we have selected 4 nationally recognized musicians and invited them for  performance weekends on Hilton Head Island, where they will perform a program of great classical works for a knowledgeable and supportive audience.  We provide, meals, housing a professional accompanist, video and audio recordings and a post-concert reception in their honor.  We find them at least one additional performance venue during their stay, where they may perform their program a second time.  The weekend affords them a glimpse of the demands and rewards that a professional performance career brings.
Local donations for these concerts cover only a portion of our expenses.  The goal of our campaign is to provide each of these young artists with a full professional fee which they may use toward career development. If you wish, you may direct your donation to a particular artist by posting a private comment (button near top of the page), or emailing us at: YAP@gimbelassociates.com

<p>HI I my name is Fred Kellogg. I am a musician, writer, and community radio programmer at KAOS 89.3 FM. I have been doing my show 'Free Jazz with Fred' since May 1999. I am also a beat boxer and have performed on several occasions at the Olympia Experimental Music Festival and have performed as well with my improv/rock band 'The Giant Worm' (we will be performing this year).</p>
<p>This is my second year as curator for the Experimental Music Festival, now in it's 21st year. It is important to me because one of the main functions of art is to present different visions of the world. In this case, through experimental music. There is no such thing as any one way to create or perform music. Each artist has their own distinct expression of order. It is not and should not be the market or (necessarily) traditional academic channels as a source or force. Thus the experimental music festival is one opportunity for artists with different visions and expressions of order to perform. And the prime purpose of this campaign is to raise funds so that the artists can receive reasonable compensation for performing.</p>
<p> I have a funding goal of $2000. I have 17 acts-some bands, some individuals. I have a number of rising stars on the Seattle alternative jazz scene, including the Samantha Boshnack Quintet and <em>Bad Luck.</em> While most performers have not received a guaranteed amount for performing, I would like to have everyone go home with at least $25.  The Indiegogo campaign is the primary source of funding, although I will also have local business's advertising on the festival program and, of course, there will be revenue received from ticket purchases. I have not yet determined what I will be charging for tickets. I should also note that while I certainly plan to have 'perks', I have not determined exactly what they will be and for what amount. I will determine that in the next few weeks. I would like the performers to donate CD's and/or videos for this purpose and I also plan to have some of our local business's provide a perk: Example: A Burger, Fries and Shake at Big Toms Family owned hamburgers stand here in Olympia. They have been a regular advertiser in our program for years </p>
<p> The festival will be held at two different venues here in Olympia. On Friday, June 26th, it will be held at The Grand Ballroom of the Olympia Eagles Club. I am renting this facility for $315 for the night. (the show starts at 7pm). I have someone providing a PA system, but I will probably need to rent lights. On Saturday, June 27th and Sunday June28th, the event will be held at Le Voyeur, a restaurant and performance space here in Olympia. (Saturdays show begins at 7pm and Sunday's show begins at 4pm). The performance space at Le Voyeur is being donated for the festival. I also plan to advertise in at least one NW music publication. I may also have to provide some accommodations to performers. </p>
<p>I realize there are any number of risks foreseeable and unforeseeable. How ever i do have a responsible team working with me and I have my previous experience as festival curator. I am familiar with both venues and have taken a number of concerns into consideration. I do want the legacy of the festival to continue, as it has become an institution in Olympia.</p>
<p>If you are unable to contrubte to the campaign, please spread the word on social media. We will be doing the same. And I do hope we do get a substantial live audience for our performer's.</p>

</div></div>","HI I my name is Fred Kellogg. I am a musician, writer, and community radio programmer at KAOS 89.3 FM. I have been doing my show 'Free Jazz with Fred' since May 1999. I am also a beat boxer and have performed on several occasions at the Olympia Experimental Music Festival and have performed as well with my improv/rock band 'The Giant Worm' (we will be performing this year).
This is my second year as curator for the Experimental Music Festival, now in it's 21st year. It is important to me because one of the main functions of art is to present different visions of the world. In this case, through experimental music. There is no such thing as any one way to create or perform music. Each artist has their own distinct expression of order. It is not and should not be the market or (necessarily) traditional academic channels as a source or force. Thus the experimental music festival is one opportunity for artists with different visions and expressions of order to perform. And the prime purpose of this campaign is to raise funds so that the artists can receive reasonable compensation for performing.
 I have a funding goal of $2000. I have 17 acts-some bands, some individuals.

<div style=""text-align: justify;"">
<div style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Don’t you wonder? What about us, our children and grandchildren? Where are we, in a world that favors corporate interests and profits over health and common welfare?</span></div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">GM
foods (GMO = genetically modified organism) and patents on seeds owned by big
corporations pose an increasing threat to biodiversity. Due to lacking long-term
studies, we still can’t be sure what risks to human health come with food that
has been genetically modified. What we do know, is that the problems caused by
GM crops are manifold:</span></div>
<ul>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">
<span><span></span></span>GM plants like BT Corn or BT Cotton are genetically
modified to kill the bugs that try to feed off them – so far so good! But by
the laws of nature it is always the survival of the fittest and we are now
faced with a new class of <b>superbugs</b>
resistant to both the crops’ implanted toxins and spray-on chemicals.</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Plants like
Roundup-ready soy or corn are engineered to survive being sprayed by non-selective
herbicides like Monsanto’s Glyphosate containing Roundup. At first glance it
seems this would lead to less herbicides being needed and indeed in the
first 5 years of planting GM crops farmers tend to be able to go by with less
chemicals. But in the long run they end up needing to spray more and even more
aggressive chemicals to get rid of the now Roundup-immune <b>superweeds.</b>
</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">
<b>Glyphosate kills nearly all vegetable and herbal life
forms!</b> Wild herbs are being killed
and that leads to a reduced biodiversity along the food chain – all the way to
mammals and birds. Pest resistant plants are also suspected to kill beneficial
bugs like honeybees and butterflies. With disastrous consequences! Pollinating
insects are vital to productive farming! Not only the total number of pollinating
insects is important but also the species diversity to ensure efficient and
reliable pollination.</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Patents protect
GM seeds and it is illegal to save the seeds for the coming season. Thus farmers
have to buy seeds every growing season from licensed dealers – in combination
with the appropriate chemicals. So farmers who used to be able to plant their
own seeds, grow their own crops and sustain themselves and their families are
now dependent on corporations – both economically and socially.</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">GM plants are
really hard to contain and get rid of! Turns out that the pollen can travel
several kilometers or more and as a result cross-pollination easily leads to
hybrids. Farmers, who have been contaminated and end up unintentionally growing
GM plants in the following season, are being sued by the corporations for not
paying royalties!<span> </span>
</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Traces of
     Glyphosate can be found in almost every person living in today’s
     industrialized world – The problem is that it can be connected to several
     health problems and studies even suggest that Glyphosate may cause cell
     damage and fertility problems. Only recently a WHO expert committee
     classified it as probably carcinogenic<i>.</i>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>OH BOY!!!</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">We consider ourselves lucky to live in Austria, where it is prohibited to grow GM crops – even those approved by the EU. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In addition to that in the European Union it is required by law that genetically modified foods be labeled as such. During our research we were surprised - no, shocked really - to find out that there are few labeling laws in place for GM foods in the USA. It basically means you don’t know if there are any genetically modified ingredients in the food you buy. And considering the numbers it is highly unlikely that you are not dealing with genetically modified products on a<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> daily basis - in one way or another. In 2014 some 94% of soybeans, 89% of corn, 95% of </span>sugar beet, 93% of canola<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> and 91% of cotton grown in the US were genetically modified. So far the FDA has not taken action to require the labeling of genetically </span>engineered<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> foods. As a result some US States have started to pass labeling laws, thus protecting the public</span>’s <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">right to know what is in the food they eat - </span>Connecticut, Maine and Vermont<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> have already passed such laws. Many more bills have been introduced and the momentum is certainly picking up as the public </span>awareness<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> grows. </span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">But at the moment that budding development in the USA as well as the high European food standards (along with many other
things we care about) are the bargaining chip in negotiations between the EU
and the USA. T-TIP (Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership) is being
negotiated behind closed doors and whilst making promises of jobs and growth it
aims at putting trade obstacles out of the way. But what could it mean for
Europeans if T-TIP, the way it is being discussed at the moment, becomes reality?</p>
<ul>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Hormone-treated meat, chlorine
chicken, cloned beef and genetically engineered food on our plates! Whereas
those things are sold every day in the US they are still prohibited in the EU - so far.</li>
<li>Fracking</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Approval norms of chemicals are to
be mutually accepted. That could allow dangerous substances to enter the
European market, only because they are permitted in the US.</li>
<li>Hard fought for employment rights are
at stake as well.<span><span></span></span>
</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">
<span><span></span></span>T-TIP also facilitates
Investor-State Dispute Settlements (ISDS) – If a country’s laws (be it
environmental laws, minimum wage or prohibition of certain substances in a
product) stand in the way of corporate interests, the corporations can sue the
country for loss of profit. <b>WHAT!?!?!</b> On the taxpayer’s dime, mind you. That
doesn’t happen before a regular court with independent judges but before an
arbitral tribunal made up of three private lawyers. The decisions made are
binding under international law. ISDS was originally introduced as a last
resort should a country not have a reliable justice system with independent
judges or laws to protect from condemnation. In the last 15 years however it
brought forth a downpour of lawsuits, increasingly targeting highly developed
legal systems like Germany, Canada or Australia.
</li>
</ul>
<ul><li style=""text-align: justify;"">T-TIP also bears potential threats
to the USA, targeting regulations in the financial sector. According to a
leaked document the EU Commission is spearheading a campaign for the interests
of the financial sector and the result could jeopardize reforms made since the
financial crisis, and elicit another era of risky deregulation!*</li></ul>
<p>
</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Facing today’s challenges and those big, powerful corporations can make one
feel small and helpless...</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">But we have been asking ourselves – How much responsibility do WE have,
each and everyone of us? What can we do to sustain our world and ensure a
livable future for generations to come? And what will become of our world if we
continue on the path we set out on hundred years ago? Are greed and selfishness
the superweeds of human nature, ineradicable? Or will we turn the wheel around,

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><i>Fragt ihr
euch das auch manchmal? Was ist mit uns, mit unseren Kindern und Enkelkindern?
Wo bleiben wir in einer Welt in der Konzerninteressen und Profite über Gesundheit
und Gemeinwohl gehen?</i></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><i>Genmanipuliertes
Saatgut und Saatgutmonopole bedrohen zunehmend die Biodiversität. Welche
Gefahren gentechnisch veränderte Lebensmittel für unsere Gesundheit darstellen,
ist noch nicht erwiesen, da es dazu bisher keine Langzeitstudien gibt. Klar
ist, die Probleme die gentechnisch verändertes Saatgut mit sich bringt sind überaus
vielfältig:</i></p>
<ul>
<li style=""text-align: justify;""><i>Gentechnisch veränderte Pflanzen wie BT Mais und BT
Baumwolle töten Schädlinge – soweit so gut! Doch funktioniert die Natur nun mal
nach dem Prinzip „der Stärkere überlebt“ und wir sehen uns nun als Folge mit
einer neuen Art von „<b>Super-Schädlingen“</b>
konfrontiert die sowohl gegen das in die Pflanzen implantierte Gift sowie auch
gegen Sprühchemikalien resistent sind.</i></li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">
<i>Weiters werden Pflanzen wie
Roundup-ready Soja oder Mais gentechnisch so verändert, dass sie einem Totalherbizid
– wie zum Beispiel </i><i>dem Glyphosat enthaltenden Roundup von Monsanto –
gegenüber resistent sind. Auf den ersten Blick scheint es auch so, als müssten
dadurch weniger Spritzmittel eingesetzt werden und in den ersten 5 Jahren
benötigen Bauern tatsächlich weniger Chemikalien. Mittelfristig steigt jedoch
der Herbizideinsatz, da immer mehr Unkräuter eine Immunität entwickeln </i><i>und so regelrechtes „<b>Super-Unkraut</b>“
entsteht!</i>
</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">
<b><i>Glyphosat
tötet nahezu alles pflanzliche Leben! </i></b><i>Wildkräuter werden totgespritzt
und eine reduzierte Artenvielfalt entlang der Nahrungskette - bis hin zu
Säugetieren und Vögeln ist die Folge. Weiters besteht der Verdacht, dass die
schädlingsresistenten Pflanzen auch Bienen und Schmetterlinge töten. Das hat
verheerende Folgen, denn Honigbienen und andere Insekten bestäuben viele
Pflanzen und sind daher unerlässlich für eine produktive Landwirtschaft! Dabei </i><i>ist aber nicht nur die Individuenzahl blütenbestäubender
Insekten wichtig, sondern auch die Vielfalt an Arten, die für eine effizientere
und zuverlässigere Bestäubung sorgt.</i>
</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">
<i>Genmanipuliertes Saatgut
ist durch <b>Patente</b> geschützt und die
Saatgutvermehrung meist nicht erlaubt. Das Saatgut muss daher jedes Jahr aufs
Neue von lizenzierten Händlern erworben werden - meist in Kombination mit den
dazugehörigen Spritzmitteln. </i><i>Das heißt, Farmer die früher ihre eigenen Felder
bebaut und sich selbst versorgt haben, leben heute in <b>wirtschaftlicher und sozialer Anhängigkeit</b> von Großkonzernen.</i>
</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;""><i>GM Pflanzen kann man nur überaus schwer wieder
loswerden! Durch Fremdbestäubung kann es leicht zu Hybriden kommen denn es hat
sich herausgestellt, dass die Pollen durchaus mehrere Kilometer überwinden
können! Baut der Farmer in Folge dessen unwissentlich GM Getreide an, kann er
von den Konzernen dafür aufgrund von nicht bezahlten Lizenzgebühren belangt
werden!</i></li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">
<i></i><i>Spuren von
     Glyphosat können im Körper von beinahe allen Menschen, die heute in der
     industrialisierten Welt leben, nachgewiesen werden – das große Problem
     dabei ist, dass Glyphosat mit zahlreichen Gesundheitsproblemen in Verbindung
     gebracht werden kann und Studien geben auch Hinweise auf erbgutschädigende
     Wirkungen von Glyphosat</i><i>. Erst kürzlich wurde der Stoff von einem
     Expertengremium der Welgesundheitsorganisation als wahrscheinlich krebserregend
     eingestuft.</i><i> </i>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<p align=""center""><b><i>NA BUMM!!!</i></b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><i>Als Österreicher dürfen wir uns eigentlich glücklich
schätzen – </i><i>denn selbst für die grundsätzlich EU-weit zugelassenen
Gentech-Pflanzen, gibt es hierzulande Anbauverbote. Doch ganz gefeit vor
Gentechnik sind auch wir nicht, denn es werden jährlich rund 450.000 Tonnen
Gentech-Soja für Tierfuttermittel importiert. Und hier weist die EU-Kennzeichnungspflicht
für Gentechnik eine Lücke auf: Zwar müssen gentechnisch veränderte Lebens- und
Futtermittel als solche gekennzeichnet werden, nicht aber die tierischen
Produkte, bei deren Produktion diese eingesetzt wurden. Beispiel: ein Bauer
füttert seine Schweine mit Gentech-Soja - das Futtermittel ist als gentechnisch
verändert gekennzeichnet, aber das Schnitzel, das beim Konsumenten am Teller
landet, muss nicht gekennzeichnet werden! Garantiert gentechnikfrei sind hierzulande
alle Bio-Produkte, sowie alle Lebensmittel mit dem grünen „gentechnikfrei
erzeugt“ - Kennzeichen. </i></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><i>Doch zur
Zeit stehen unsere hohen Europäischen Lebensmittelstandards (und noch vieles
mehr was uns wichtig ist) auf dem Spiel – hinter verschlossenen Türen verhandeln
USA und EU derzeit über TTIP (Transatlantische Handels- und
Investitionspartnerschaft). Dabei sollen Handelshindernisse aus dem Weg geräumt
werden. Aber was könnte das für uns Europäer bedeuten, wenn TTIP, wie es derzeit verhandelt wird, tatsächlich zustande
kommt? </i></p>
<ul>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">
<i>Hormonfleisch, Chlorhühner, Klonrinder und
Gentechnik auf unseren Tellern! Diese haben sich in den USA längst durchgesetzt
- in der EU ist das noch verboten.</i><span><span></span></span>
</li>
<li>
<span><span></span></span><i>Gasgewinnung durch Fracking</i>
</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">
<i>Zulassungsstandards von chemischen Stoffen sollen
gegenseitig anerkannt werden. Dadurch könnten gefährliche Stoffe in Europa auf
den Markt kommen nur weil sie in den USA zugelassen sind.</i><span><span></span></span>
</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">
<span><span></span></span><i>Hierzulande hart erkämpfte Arbeitnehmerrechte stehen
ebenfalls auf dem Spiel.</i>
</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">
<i>TTIP erleichtert Investor-Staats-Klagen (ISDS) –
Wenn einem Konzern die Gesetze (zum Beispiel Umweltschutzgesetze, Mindestlöhne,
Verbot gewisser Inhaltsstoffe in Produkten) eines Landes im Wege stehen, kann
er den Staat wegen entgangenen Gewinnes auf Schadensersatz verklagen. <b>WHAT!?!?!
</b>Und das Ganze auch noch zu Lasten des Steuerzahlers. Das findet aber nicht etwa
vor einem normalen Gericht mit unabhängigen Richtern statt, sondern vor einem
sogenannten Schiedsgericht bestehend aus drei privaten Anwälten. Die
getroffenen Entscheidungen sind völkerrechtlich bindend. Das ISDS wurde
ursprünglich als Notinstrument eingeführt, wenn in Ländern kein verlässliches
Rechtssystem mit unabhängigen Gerichten zur Verfügung stand oder keine Gesetze
zum Schutz gegen Enteignung in Kraft waren. </i><i>In den
letzten 15 Jahren hat sich allerdings eine regelrechte Klageindustrie
entwickelt, die auch zunehmend Staaten mit hochentwickelten Rechtssystemen wie
Deutschland, Kanada und Australien ins Visier nimmt. </i>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul><li style=""text-align: justify;""><i>Aber TTIP könnte auch negative Auswirkungen für die
USA haben, vorwiegend auf dem Finanzsektor. Es scheint als würde die EU
Kommission eine Kampagne im Sinne der Finanzbranche anführen und damit die
Reformen gefährden die in den USA als Folge der Finanzkrise durchgeführt wurden
und somit eine neue Ära riskanter Deregulierungen hervorbringen.*</i></li></ul>
<p>
</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><i>Im Angesicht der Herausforderungen, vor denen wir und unsere Welt heute stehen, und vor allem gegenüber den übermächtigen Konzernen fühlt man sich
leicht klein und hilflos...<br/></i></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><i>Aber wir fragen uns doch - Wie viel Verantwortung
tragen WIR, jeder einzelne von uns? Was können wir selbst tun, um unsere Welt
auch für zukünftige Generationen lebenswert zu halten? Was wird aus unserer
Welt, wenn wir so weiter machen wie in den letzten hundert Jahren? Sitzen Gier
und Egoismus zu tief und unüberwindbar in der menschlichen Natur, oder schaffen
wir es GEMEINSAM, den eingeschlagenen Kurs noch zu korrigieren bevor es
endgültig zu spät ist? Wir sind Optimistinnen und glauben, und hoffen, und sind
nicht bereit aufzugeben! Weder die Zuversicht noch den Willen etwas zu
bewirken, Samenkorn für Samenkorn (natürlich gentechnikfrei!)... </i></p>

said, that I entered the world singing! I am a successful Singer-Songwriter and
winner of the European Border Breakers Award 2014.

Together with my longtime friend and award winning filmmaker Alexandra
Wedenig we just set out on a quest for a livable future.
Together we are WAU >> pronounce wow!

Politics not
being our path, we voice our deep concern for the world we live in using the
power of music and images. 
The first
project we undertake as Team WAU is producing the music video to the brand-new
GuGabriel song WHAT ABOUT US. The song talks about a topic we feel very passionate
about  - genetically modified crops
and all the problems they bring along! It calls on all of us to take
responsibility – for us and our planet, now and for generations to come!
Join our Team
and become a vital part in spreading the message!

Ich bin eine erfolgreiche Singer-Songwriterin und Gewinnerin des European Border Breakers Award 2014. Mit einer langjährigen Freundin, der Filmemacherin Alexandra Wedenig, haben wir kürzlich What About US, unsere Plattform für eine lebenswerte Zukunft, gestartet. Gemeinsam sind wir WAU!Die Welt, in der wir leben, liegt uns beiden sehr am Herzen. Da aber die Politik nicht unser Weg ist, tragen wir unsere Anliegen auf künstlerisch Weise in die Welt .Das erste Projekt das wir gemeinsam als Team WAU umsetzen werden, ist ein Musikvideo zum  gleichnamigen, neuen Song von GuGabriel. In WHAT ABOUT US geht es um ein Thema das uns beiden sehr wichtig ist - genmanipuliertes Saatgut und all die Probleme, die es so mit sich bringt. Der Song ist ein Aufruf an uns alle, Verantwortung zu übernehmen – für uns und unseren Planeten, jetzt und für die nachfolgenden Generationen.
Schließt euch uns an und tragt entscheidend dazu bei, die Botschaft in die Welt zu tragen!

Don’t you wonder? What about us, our children and grandchildren? Where are we, in a world that favors corporate interests and profits over health and common welfare?
GM
foods (GMO = genetically modified organism) and patents on seeds owned by big
corporations pose an increasing threat to biodiversity. Due to lacking long-term
studies, we still can’t be sure what risks to human health come with food that
has been genetically modified. What we do know, is that the problems caused by
GM crops are manifold:


GM plants like BT Corn or BT Cotton are genetically
modified to kill the bugs that try to feed off them – so far so good! But by
the laws of nature it is always the survival of the fittest and we are now
faced with a new class of superbugs
resistant to both the crops’ implanted toxins and spray-on chemicals.
Plants like
Roundup-ready soy or corn are engineered to survive being sprayed by non-selective
herbicides like Monsanto’s Glyphosate containing Roundup. At first glance it
seems this would lead to less herbicides being needed and indeed in the
first 5 years of planting GM crops farmers tend to be able to go by with less
chemicals. But in the long run they end up needing to spray more and even more
aggressive chemicals to get rid of the now Roundup-immune superweeds.


Glyphosate kills nearly all vegetable and herbal life
forms! Wild herbs are being killed
and that leads to a reduced biodiversity along the food chain – all the way to
mammals and birds. Pest resistant plants are also suspected to kill beneficial
bugs like honeybees and butterflies. With disastrous consequences! Pollinating
insects are vital to productive farming! Not only the total number of pollinating
insects is important but also the species diversity to ensure efficient and
reliable pollination.
Patents protect
GM seeds and it is illegal to save the seeds for the coming season. Thus farmers
have to buy seeds every growing season from licensed dealers – in combination
with the appropriate chemicals. So farmers who used to be able to plant their
own seeds, grow their own crops and sustain themselves and their families are
now dependent on corporations – both economically and socially.
GM plants are
really hard to contain and get rid of! Turns out that the pollen can travel
several kilometers or more and as a result cross-pollination easily leads to
hybrids. Farmers, who have been contaminated and end up unintentionally growing
GM plants in the following season, are being sued by the corporations for not
paying royalties! 

Traces of
     Glyphosate can be found in almost every person living in today’s
     industrialized world – The problem is that it can be connected to several
     health problems and studies even suggest that Glyphosate may cause cell
     damage and fertility problems. Only recently a WHO expert committee
     classified it as probably carcinogenic.




OH BOY!!!
We consider ourselves lucky to live in Austria, where it is prohibited to grow GM crops – even those approved by the EU. 
In addition to that in the European Union it is required by law that genetically modified foods be labeled as such. During our research we were surprised - no, shocked really - to find out that there are few labeling laws in place for GM foods in the USA. It basically means you don’t know if there are any genetically modified ingredients in the food you buy. And considering the numbers it is highly unlikely that you are not dealing with genetically modified products on a daily basis - in one way or another. In 2014 some 94% of soybeans, 89% of corn, 95% of sugar beet, 93% of canola and 91% of cotton grown in the US were genetically modified. So far the FDA has not taken action to require the labeling of genetically engineered foods. As a result some US States have started to pass labeling laws, thus protecting the public’s right to know what is in the food they eat - Connecticut, Maine and Vermont have already passed such laws. Many more bills have been introduced and the momentum is certainly picking up as the public awareness grows. 
But at the moment that budding development in the USA as well as the high European food standards (along with many other
things we care about) are the bargaining chip in negotiations between the EU
and the USA. T-TIP (Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership) is being
negotiated behind closed doors and whilst making promises of jobs and growth it
aims at putting trade obstacles out of the way. But what could it mean for
Europeans if T-TIP, the way it is being discussed at the moment, becomes reality?

Hormone-treated meat, chlorine
chicken, cloned beef and genetically engineered food on our plates! Whereas
those things are sold every day in the US they are still prohibited in the EU - so far.
Fracking
Approval norms of chemicals are to
be mutually accepted. That could allow dangerous substances to enter the
European market, only because they are permitted in the US.
Hard fought for employment rights are
at stake as well.


T-TIP also facilitates
Investor-State Dispute Settlements (ISDS) – If a country’s laws (be it
environmental laws, minimum wage or prohibition of certain substances in a
product) stand in the way of corporate interests, the corporations can sue the
country for loss of profit. WHAT!?!?! On the taxpayer’s dime, mind you. That
doesn’t happen before a regular court with independent judges but before an
arbitral tribunal made up of three private lawyers. The decisions made are
binding under international law. ISDS was originally introduced as a last
resort should a country not have a reliable justice system with independent
judges or laws to protect from condemnation. In the last 15 years however it
brought forth a downpour of lawsuits, increasingly targeting highly developed
legal systems like Germany, Canada or Australia.


T-TIP also bears potential threats
to the USA, targeting regulations in the financial sector. According to a
leaked document the EU Commission is spearheading a campaign for the interests
of the financial sector and the result could jeopardize reforms made since the
financial crisis, and elicit another era of risky deregulation!*


Facing today’s challenges and those big, powerful corporations can make one
feel small and helpless...
But we have been asking ourselves – How much responsibility do WE have,
each and everyone of us? What can we do to sustain our world and ensure a
livable future for generations to come? And what will become of our world if we
continue on the path we set out on hundred years ago? Are greed and selfishness
the superweeds of human nature, ineradicable? Or will we turn the wheel around,
TOGETHER, before it is too late? We are optimists and believe and trust and
hope and are not willing to give up! Neither confidence nor the intention to
make a difference, a seed at a time (GMO-free!)…

Fragt ihr
euch das auch manchmal? Was ist mit uns, mit unseren Kindern und Enkelkindern?
Wo bleiben wir in einer Welt in der Konzerninteressen und Profite über Gesundheit
und Gemeinwohl gehen?
Genmanipuliertes
Saatgut und Saatgutmonopole bedrohen zunehmend die Biodiversität. Welche
Gefahren gentechnisch veränderte Lebensmittel für unsere Gesundheit darstellen,
ist noch nicht erwiesen, da es dazu bisher keine Langzeitstudien gibt. Klar
ist, die Probleme die gentechnisch verändertes Saatgut mit sich bringt sind überaus
vielfältig:

Gentechnisch veränderte Pflanzen wie BT Mais und BT
Baumwolle töten Schädlinge – soweit so gut! Doch funktioniert die Natur nun mal
nach dem Prinzip „der Stärkere überlebt“ und wir sehen uns nun als Folge mit
einer neuen Art von „Super-Schädlingen“
konfrontiert die sowohl gegen das in die Pflanzen implantierte Gift sowie auch
gegen Sprühchemikalien resistent sind.

Weiters werden Pflanzen wie
Roundup-ready Soja oder Mais gentechnisch so verändert, dass sie einem Totalherbizid
– wie zum Beispiel dem Glyphosat enthaltenden Roundup von Monsanto –
gegenüber resistent sind. Auf den ersten Blick scheint es auch so, als müssten
dadurch weniger Spritzmittel eingesetzt werden und in den ersten 5 Jahren
benötigen Bauern tatsächlich weniger Chemikalien. Mittelfristig steigt jedoch
der Herbizideinsatz, da immer mehr Unkräuter eine Immunität entwickeln und so regelrechtes „Super-Unkraut“
entsteht!


Glyphosat
tötet nahezu alles pflanzliche Leben! Wildkräuter werden totgespritzt
und eine reduzierte Artenvielfalt entlang der Nahrungskette - bis hin zu
Säugetieren und Vögeln ist die Folge. Weiters besteht der Verdacht, dass die
schädlingsresistenten Pflanzen auch Bienen und Schmetterlinge töten. Das hat
verheerende Folgen, denn Honigbienen und andere Insekten bestäuben viele
Pflanzen und sind daher unerlässlich für eine produktive Landwirtschaft! Dabei ist aber nicht nur die Individuenzahl blütenbestäubender
Insekten wichtig, sondern auch die Vielfalt an Arten, die für eine effizientere
und zuverlässigere Bestäubung sorgt.


Genmanipuliertes Saatgut
ist durch Patente geschützt und die
Saatgutvermehrung meist nicht erlaubt. Das Saatgut muss daher jedes Jahr aufs
Neue von lizenzierten Händlern erworben werden - meist in Kombination mit den
dazugehörigen Spritzmitteln. Das heißt, Farmer die früher ihre eigenen Felder
bebaut und sich selbst versorgt haben, leben heute in wirtschaftlicher und sozialer Anhängigkeit von Großkonzernen.

GM Pflanzen kann man nur überaus schwer wieder
loswerden! Durch Fremdbestäubung kann es leicht zu Hybriden kommen denn es hat
sich herausgestellt, dass die Pollen durchaus mehrere Kilometer überwinden
können! Baut der Farmer in Folge dessen unwissentlich GM Getreide an, kann er
von den Konzernen dafür aufgrund von nicht bezahlten Lizenzgebühren belangt
werden!

Spuren von
     Glyphosat können im Körper von beinahe allen Menschen, die heute in der
     industrialisierten Welt leben, nachgewiesen werden – das große Problem
     dabei ist, dass Glyphosat mit zahlreichen Gesundheitsproblemen in Verbindung
     gebracht werden kann und Studien geben auch Hinweise auf erbgutschädigende
     Wirkungen von Glyphosat. Erst kürzlich wurde der Stoff von einem
     Expertengremium der Welgesundheitsorganisation als wahrscheinlich krebserregend
     eingestuft. 




NA BUMM!!!
Als Österreicher dürfen wir uns eigentlich glücklich
schätzen – denn selbst für die grundsätzlich EU-weit zugelassenen
Gentech-Pflanzen, gibt es hierzulande Anbauverbote. Doch ganz gefeit vor
Gentechnik sind auch wir nicht, denn es werden jährlich rund 450.000 Tonnen
Gentech-Soja für Tierfuttermittel importiert. Und hier weist die EU-Kennzeichnungspflicht
für Gentechnik eine Lücke auf: Zwar müssen gentechnisch veränderte Lebens- und
Futtermittel als solche gekennzeichnet werden, nicht aber die tierischen
Produkte, bei deren Produktion diese eingesetzt wurden. Beispiel: ein Bauer
füttert seine Schweine mit Gentech-Soja - das Futtermittel ist als gentechnisch
verändert gekennzeichnet, aber das Schnitzel, das beim Konsumenten am Teller
landet, muss nicht gekennzeichnet werden! Garantiert gentechnikfrei sind hierzulande
alle Bio-Produkte, sowie alle Lebensmittel mit dem grünen „gentechnikfrei
erzeugt“ - Kennzeichen. 
Doch zur
Zeit stehen unsere hohen Europäischen Lebensmittelstandards (und noch vieles
mehr was uns wichtig ist) auf dem Spiel – hinter verschlossenen Türen verhandeln
USA und EU derzeit über TTIP (Transatlantische Handels- und
Investitionspartnerschaft). Dabei sollen Handelshindernisse aus dem Weg geräumt
werden. Aber was könnte das für uns Europäer bedeuten, wenn TTIP, wie es derzeit verhandelt wird, tatsächlich zustande
kommt? 


Hormonfleisch, Chlorhühner, Klonrinder und
Gentechnik auf unseren Tellern! Diese haben sich in den USA längst durchgesetzt
- in der EU ist das noch verboten.


Gasgewinnung durch Fracking


Zulassungsstandards von chemischen Stoffen sollen
gegenseitig anerkannt werden. Dadurch könnten gefährliche Stoffe in Europa auf
den Markt kommen nur weil sie in den USA zugelassen sind.


Hierzulande hart erkämpfte Arbeitnehmerrechte stehen
ebenfalls auf dem Spiel.


TTIP erleichtert Investor-Staats-Klagen (ISDS) –
Wenn einem Konzern die Gesetze (zum Beispiel Umweltschutzgesetze, Mindestlöhne,
Verbot gewisser Inhaltsstoffe in Produkten) eines Landes im Wege stehen, kann
er den Staat wegen entgangenen Gewinnes auf Schadensersatz verklagen. WHAT!?!?!
Und das Ganze auch noch zu Lasten des Steuerzahlers. Das findet aber nicht etwa
vor einem normalen Gericht mit unabhängigen Richtern statt, sondern vor einem
sogenannten Schiedsgericht bestehend aus drei privaten Anwälten. Die
getroffenen Entscheidungen sind völkerrechtlich bindend. Das ISDS wurde
ursprünglich als Notinstrument eingeführt, wenn in Ländern kein verlässliches
Rechtssystem mit unabhängigen Gerichten zur Verfügung stand oder keine Gesetze
zum Schutz gegen Enteignung in Kraft waren. In den
letzten 15 Jahren hat sich allerdings eine regelrechte Klageindustrie
entwickelt, die auch zunehmend Staaten mit hochentwickelten Rechtssystemen wie
Deutschland, Kanada und Australien ins Visier nimmt. 




Aber TTIP könnte auch negative Auswirkungen für die
USA haben, vorwiegend auf dem Finanzsektor. Es scheint als würde die EU
Kommission eine Kampagne im Sinne der Finanzbranche anführen und damit die
Reformen gefährden die in den USA als Folge der Finanzkrise durchgeführt wurden
und somit eine neue Ära riskanter Deregulierungen hervorbringen.*


Im Angesicht der Herausforderungen, vor denen wir und unsere Welt heute stehen, und vor allem gegenüber den übermächtigen Konzernen fühlt man sich
leicht klein und hilflos...
Aber wir fragen uns doch - Wie viel Verantwortung
tragen WIR, jeder einzelne von uns? Was können wir selbst tun, um unsere Welt
auch für zukünftige Generationen lebenswert zu halten? Was wird aus unserer
Welt, wenn wir so weiter machen wie in den letzten hundert Jahren? Sitzen Gier
und Egoismus zu tief und unüberwindbar in der menschlichen Natur, oder schaffen
wir es GEMEINSAM, den eingeschlagenen Kurs noch zu korrigieren bevor es
endgültig zu spät ist? Wir sind Optimistinnen und glauben, und hoffen, und sind
nicht bereit aufzugeben! Weder die Zuversicht noch den Willen etwas zu
bewirken, Samenkorn für Samenkorn (natürlich gentechnikfrei!)...

ARCHE NOAH was established in 1989 as an initiative of heirloom gardeners, farmers and journalists, concerned with the future of seeds and heirloom varieties.
Over the last 100 years, the diversity of our cultivated plants has dramatically decreased all over the globe due to the industrialization of agriculture – more than 75% are already lost. Today, genetic engineering and various seed-monopolies, climate change and wars are threatening this precious heritage.ARCHE
NOAH responds to the loss of agro-biodiversity with a positive vision and
numerous activities. All of us can contribute to more diversity through
cultivation of threatened varieties in our gardens, through consumer awareness
and political commitment.


We, the team of WHAT ABOUT US, are overjoyed to
have permission to shoot part of the video in the beautiful ARCHE NOAH Garden!
                                                                          *  *  * 
Der Verein
ARCHE NOAH entstand 1989 auf Initiative von GärtnerInnen, BäuerInnen und
JournalistInnen, die das Saatgut als Grundlage der Ernährung buchstäblich
wieder in die eigenen Hände nehmen wollten. Denn: Seit 1900 ist die Vielfalt
unserer Kulturpflanzen durch die Industrialisierung der Landwirtschaft weltweit
dramatisch – um 75% – zurückgegangen! Heute gefährden Gentechnik,
Saatgut-Monopole, Klimawandel und Kriege dieses kostbare Erbe.

ARCHE NOAH hält dem eine positive Vision und zahlreiche Aktivitäten entgegen:
ARCHE NOAH bewahrt und pflegt tausende gefährdete Gemüse-, Obst- und
Getreidesorten. Erfolgreich arbeitet der Verein daran, traditionelle und seltene
Sorten wieder in die Gärten und auf den Markt zu bringen – dank der
Unterstützung von über 11.000 engagierten Mitgliedern und zahlreichen
Förderern. 

Wir, das
Team von WHAT ABOUT US, schätzen uns überaus glücklich einen Teil des Videos im
wunderschönen ARCHE NOAH Schaugarten im Waldviertel drehen zu dürfen!

<p><b>All about the Brides Of Funkenstein! </b></p>

<p>The Brides' second album <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Never_Buy_Texas_From_A_Cowboy"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Never Buy Texas From A Cowboy</a> was called one of the top 50 coolest albums of all time by Rolling Stone and got the ladies a ""Best Female Award"" from Cashbox... between their work as The Brides and as part of the P-Funk Collective, they're truly the innovators of Femininity-FUNK.  And they did back-up vocals on many, many funk classics.</p>
<p>In 2015, Dawn and Jeanette are going to take it to the stage with a world tour, a CD and DVD of all-new material that will feature contributions from their legendary funky friends like <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Wesley"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Morrison"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Junie Morrison</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Worrell"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Bernie Worell</a> and much, much more.  </p>

<b>Releasing A New DVD: </b>Featuring 12 all-new songs and video of every single song, including outtakes and special behind-the-scenes videos.</li>
<li>
<b>Releasing New Singles and a Full Album of New Material:</b>  The First Ladies of Funk will get back into the studio to record an album of all-new material, and the supporters of our indiegogo campaign will be the first ones to get it!</li>

</div>
<div>
<div>
<p>By taking part in this experiment you yourself are taking charge and helping to change how we make music and fund our shows. <br/><br/>You are putting faith in us to come through and show you that we've evolved as the music industry has evolved. <br/><br/>Every time we've headed into the studio in the past or to the stage, we've kept all the people who have supported this band in mind. The level of responsibility is so much higher this time.</p>
<p>With that in mind, we give you OUR word that we will not settle for “good enough” - we won't take any shortcuts, and above all – the money we raise in this thing will be reflected in the final product.</p>
<p>Here's to making our best album, DVD and concert tour yet as well as a great Internet site and mobile app.</p>
</div>
<h3>Other ways you can help</h3>If you don't have the resources and aren't sure you can commit to helping us financially– there are other ways you can help out. SPREAD THE WORD! Tell your family and friends and let them know what's going on. <br/><br/>We don't expect everyone who's listened to and enjoyed our music to jump on board, just let people know this is happening. With all the social networking and ways we now connect with one another, by posting links to this page you are reaching places we would never be able to reach on our own.</div>
<p></p>
<h3>The Estimated Budget</h3>
<p>We're looking to raise a total of $200,000  to help fund the design of our 2015 international tour, to produce and create the DVD , to record the music, to develop and update our website and mobile app, to help administer and raise the necessary funding to fulfill all our campaign obligations and finally to pay all fees to Indie GoGo for helping us to use this platform to raise the funds we need!</p>

Some of the most iconic music in the history of the 20th Century came out of the P-Funk Collective, with Dawn Silva, Jeanette Washington-Perkins and Brides of Funkenstein leading the charge, selling millions of records and entertaining countless funkateers worldwide.In 2015, these founding females of funk (along with their funky friends) are coming back to put the funk back on top and need your help to design a stage show for our international tour, DVD, album, their mobile app and a relaunch of their website.  
All about the Brides Of Funkenstein! 
The Brides of Funkenstein came together in the heyday of the seminal funk group Parliament-Funkadelic, providing vocals for the legendary Guitarist Eddie Hazel's Album, Game, Dames and Guitar Thangs and P-Funk leader George Clinton produced their debut album Funk Or Walk, selling more than 300,000 copies in the first week after its release, with the single ""Disco To Go"" certified gold in the USA. 
The Brides' second album Never Buy Texas From A Cowboy was called one of the top 50 coolest albums of all time by Rolling Stone and got the ladies a ""Best Female Award"" from Cashbox... between their work as The Brides and as part of the P-Funk Collective, they're truly the innovators of Femininity-FUNK.  And they did back-up vocals on many, many funk classics.
In 2015, Dawn and Jeanette are going to take it to the stage with a world tour, a CD and DVD of all-new material that will feature contributions from their legendary funky friends like Junie Morrison and Bernie Worell and much, much more.  
We hope you'll come along for the ride... 
And just who are The Brides?!?
Dawn Silva

Dawn's career started as a backup vocalist with Sly And The Family Stone until her and fellow Sly member Lynn Mabry joined the P-Funk Collective in 1978.  In 1982, she worked and toured with The Gap Band, collaborated with and supported artists that include Ice Cube, Snoop Dogg, Coolio, B.B. King, Dave Stewart, Roy Ayers and of course Parliament Funkadelic.  
Her first solo album, All My Funky Friends (Musisoft, 2000) was hailed as the first real funk record to come out in two decades.  She's truly one of the originators of the FUNK.

A recent FUNK show from the First Ladies of Funk:

So What the FUNK are we doing here anyway?!? 

We're on a mission to make 2015 the year of the return of UNCUT Femininity FUNK - and that includes:



Releasing A New DVD: Featuring 12 all-new songs and video of every single song, including outtakes and special behind-the-scenes videos.

Releasing New Singles and a Full Album of New Material:  The First Ladies of Funk will get back into the studio to record an album of all-new material, and the supporters of our indiegogo campaign will be the first ones to get it!

A World Tour: The ladies are taking it to the stage starting with a gig in Barbados in February, then across the USA, Europe, Asia and beyond.

With your help, we can funkify the world in 2015.   What we need and what you get When everything is said and done, this campaign is all about you, the Funk Soldiers and the Brides of Funkenstein. We want to give you something of real value, how we're going to spend the money you give us, and what the benefits are to you, the Funk Soldiers who stand behind The Brides.  And, if we are going to do this right, we can't skimp on quality - we want to make sure everything - from the tours to the music to the videos are all top notch and give you the value you deserve.So that means, no matter what the final amount of money we raise will be (we're doing a Flex Funding campaign so that if we exceed or fall short of our goals, we'll be able to revise our efforts and products based on what we have the funds to create for YOU) and regardless of the final amount of money we raise, there will be a new DVD, a tour, a new website and album.Also, know that anything offered here as part of this campaign is exclusive to Indie GoGo fans and not available anywhere else.

The Impact



By taking part in this experiment you yourself are taking charge and helping to change how we make music and fund our shows. You are putting faith in us to come through and show you that we've evolved as the music industry has evolved. Every time we've headed into the studio in the past or to the stage, we've kept all the people who have supported this band in mind. The level of responsibility is so much higher this time.
With that in mind, we give you OUR word that we will not settle for “good enough” - we won't take any shortcuts, and above all – the money we raise in this thing will be reflected in the final product.
Here's to making our best album, DVD and concert tour yet as well as a great Internet site and mobile app.

Other ways you can helpIf you don't have the resources and aren't sure you can commit to helping us financially– there are other ways you can help out. SPREAD THE WORD! Tell your family and friends and let them know what's going on. We don't expect everyone who's listened to and enjoyed our music to jump on board, just let people know this is happening. With all the social networking and ways we now connect with one another, by posting links to this page you are reaching places we would never be able to reach on our own.

The Estimated Budget
We're looking to raise a total of $200,000  to help fund the design of our 2015 international tour, to produce and create the DVD , to record the music, to develop and update our website and mobile app, to help administer and raise the necessary funding to fulfill all our campaign obligations and finally to pay all fees to Indie GoGo for helping us to use this platform to raise the funds we need!",2.0,1,"1 Campaign
