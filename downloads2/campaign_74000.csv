<h2>Why should I back</h2>
<h3>Support Open Source Software</h3>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<h3>Protect your investment</h3>
<p>If you love Cultured Code Things the same as I do than you can protect your investment. Use it as long as you like and be assured that it won't be a dead-end street. Your data can be migrated to another tool on another platform. Even If you just plan to buy Things. Do it, you won't regret. Your data is save.</p>
<h3>Switch to another platform</h3>
<p>See above .. my motivation.</p>
<h3>But your project has been funded already</h3>
<p>Can I just wait until your tool goes Open Source? Sure, but the more you fund, the longer can I support the programs involved: Things, Wunderlist and todo2todo. There will be newer versions with new features, new file formats or new APIs.</p>

<li>There is no common data exchange format for tasks</li>
<li>There is o third party cloud service to transform from Things to another tool</li>
</ul>
<h2>Idea</h2>
<p>The main idea is to use the automation features of Things to generate a data file that contains all the information you gathered in Things. Wunderlist's web application has a backup/restore feature that uses a proprietary data format. I will reverse engineer this format (it is JSON) and transform/output its content into a Wunderlist-compatible format.</p>

<h2>Platform</h2>
<p>The converter tool will run on OSX Yosemite and later versions because it uses features introduced in OSX 10.10.</p>
<p>There will be an application that can be started without any interaction or additional configuration. It will create a file according to the transformation rules described below.</p>
<p>For power users there will be a command line script that can be configured with custom parameters as a stretch goal.</p>
<p>The tool will be open source. The binaries will be available for download from a public Bitbucket repository.</p>
<h2>Can I deliver</h2>
<p></p><p>YES, I CAN. I'm a professional developer and have been successfully delivering projects in commercial environments for almost 20 years now. I drive a number of open source projects (<a href=""https://bitbucket.org/n_wehrle"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Bitbucket</a>) as lead developer. The project with the broadest audience is a plugin for Adobe Lightroom, helping to organize your photo library. I also blog (<a href=""http://blog.frontend.li/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">blog.frontend.li</a>, in German) about web development in general.

<ul>
<li>Automate Things to generate a data file: 16 hours</li>
<li>Reverse engineer Wunderlist backup format and create minimal examples by hand: 8 hours</li>
<li>Transform Things to Wunderlist format: 16 hours</li>

<li>Working on the project's homepage: 2 hours</li>

<p>I plan to deliver the first public release of the tool one month after a successful funding: <strong>20 May 2015</strong></p>
<h2>Transformation rules</h2>
<p>Things and Wunderlist support GTD differently. In Things every subtask can have the same metadata as a task. In wunderlist subtasks have neither tags, notes or due dates.</p>
<p>My aim is to transfer all available information from Things to Wunderlist. That is why I will introduce the following mapping, which might be optimised adapted as the project moves along.</p>
<ul>
<li>Things projects will become Wunderlist tasks</li>
<li>Things top-level tasks will become Wunderlist tasks</li>
<li>notes, tags and dates that belong to a Things project or top-level task will become notes, tags and dates on a Wunderlist task</li>
<li>tasks within Things projects will become Wunderlist sub-tasks</li>
<li>the horizon of focus in Things will become a tag in Wunderlist</li>
<li>areas of responsibility end up as Lists in Wunderlist</li>
<li>tasks that are planned for ""today"" in Things will be starred in Wunderlist</li>
<li>dates and notes of Things projects tasks will be attached to the parent task's note in Wunderlist</li>
<li>tags that are on a Things project task will be attached to the parent task in Wunderlist</li>
<li>the Things inbox will become an ordinary list in Wunderlist (please move the few items in there by hand to the Wunderlist inbox)</li>
<li>Things tasks that don't have an area of responsibility will be placed in a default list in Wunderlist</li>
<li>If you use persons in Things, your tasks can be found in a list named after the area of responsibility. For now tagging the task with the persons name is not planned, as I believe the feature is rarely used</li>
<li>Reoccuring tasks will not be exported from things (in the initial release)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Risks</h2>
<p>Yes, there are risks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cultured Code could change their automation features (probability: low)</li>
<li>Wunderlist could change their backup/restore feature (probability: low)</li>
<li>The way I transform from Things to Wunderlist does not match your workflow.</li>
<li>After testing Wunderlist or Todoist you will return to Things. But hey, at least you had a chance to test drive another GTD app with real live data!</li>

There is no export feature in Cultured Code Things
There is no import feature in Wunderlist

tasks that are planned for ""today"" in Things will be starred in Wunderlist
dates and notes of Things projects tasks will be attached to the parent task's note in Wunderlist
tags that are on a Things project task will be attached to the parent task in Wunderlist
the Things inbox will become an ordinary list in Wunderlist (please move the few items in there by hand to the Wunderlist inbox)
Things tasks that don't have an area of responsibility will be placed in a default list in Wunderlist
If you use persons in Things, your tasks can be found in a list named after the area of responsibility. For now tagging the task with the persons name is not planned, as I believe the feature is rarely used
Reoccuring tasks will not be exported from things (in the initial release)

Risks
Yes, there are risks:

Cultured Code could change their automation features (probability: low)
Wunderlist could change their backup/restore feature (probability: low)
The way I transform from Things to Wunderlist does not match your workflow.
After testing Wunderlist or Todoist you will return to Things. But hey, at least you had a chance to test drive another GTD app with real live data!

If you'll join us, we're going to give you some great perks just for being part of the team. Keep reading to find out more!<br/><br/><b>THE VISION</b><br/><br/>Side Street came about as a dream to offer Kaufman residents some great quality coffee, a relaxing space to meet with friends, and a productive work environment. We hope you've enjoyed our quaint little shop so far, as well as our friendly staff.<p>Our customer base continues to grow, but the private funding behind Side Street is soon to run dry. We need your help to cover some expenses so we can remain open and Kaufman can continue to enjoy a great coffee shop. Without you, we'll have no choice but to shut our doors.</p>
<p><b>COFFEE WITH A PURPOSE</b><br/></p>
<p>Side Street has never been about profit. Although not a designated nonprofit, owners Dick and Nancy Murphy are committed to the vision of the coffee producers Side Street supports. HOPE Coffee uses 100% Arabica coffee beans that are cupped for quality 
and classified as specialty grade strictly high grown (SHG) coffee. This delicious coffee comes from Honduras through  partnership with small local
 coffee farmer associations like Cultivadores del Reino (Kingdom 
Growers). Additionally, HOPE coffee exists to make a real difference. Each year the company produces a report that tells many of the stories and shares 
the impact HOPE Coffee’s profits have made in the lives 
of the poor in Honduras. Families receive shelter, clean water, and renewed hope. There are plenty of places you can buy good beverages, but do you know where all your hard-earned money is going when you do? At Side Street, you know that every purchase you make contributes directly to helping reduce poverty in Central America. Drinking our coffee saves lives!<br/></p>
<p><b>THE NEED</b><br/></p>
<p>The community of Kaufman is growing, and with that growth comes a demand for great coffee. We've worked hard to produce creative, quality espresso drinks just for you. Our menu continues to expand to offer you more and more coffee and coffee-free options. But we know that with your support we could take our production to the next level. Your contributions will give us the opportunity to purchase a better espresso machine, leading to better coffee and more efficient service. Additionally, we'll be able to compensate our staff to be open at more hours that are most convenient for our varied customer base, as we continue to grow.<br/></p>
<p>With your help, we'll offer more food options like you've been asking for. And of course - we want to remain Kaufman's go-to spot for FREE wireless internet.</p>
<p>Additionally, Side Street's hope is to increase cultural opportunities for Kaufman. We display and highlight the art of numerous local artists, only adding to our already unique and homey environment. We've also hosted musicians and more! With your help, we'll be able to partner with more and more groups and individuals with similar aspirations to bring more cultural opportunities to Kaufman.<br/></p>
<p>We hate to even think about it; but without Side Street, Kaufman would be left without its best espresso, best art, and comfiest public couches!</p>
<p><b>WHAT'S IN IT FOR YOU</b><br/></p>
<p>And now for the fun part! If you'll help us meet our funding goal, you'll get some great perks! Things like free espresso drinks, t-shirts, travel mugs, and other cool swag. As well as fun, unique gifts like catered meetings and drink-naming. Just take a look at the right side of this page and choose your preferred gift level!</p>
<p><b>THANKS!</b><br/></p>
<p>If you'd truly like to see Side Street succeed, share this page with your friends! Use the provided share tools to get the word out on social media and through text messages and emails. The more the merrier!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Jacob. I have researched and produced marijuana for over 20 years now. Medical marijuana and CPD oils has proven to be my leading form of natural medication. CPD oils has helped greatly with my chronic pain and arthritis over the past several years. Medical marijuana and CPD oils has helped our family and friends achieve positive health results and improved quality of life.  Pharmaceutical medications can cause permanent disfunction to the liver and kidneys which as a result can lead to severe health problems and ongoing treatment. The natural healing properties from cannabis are proven to help with mental health, disease and may even prevent cancer.  Medical Cannabis is known and proven to help with many forms of :</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">ADHD, BIPOLAR, ANXIETY, SLEEP APNIA, DEPRESSION, TUMORS, CANCER, SEIZURES, PARKENSONS DISEASE, HEADACHES, PTSD, EATING DISORDERS, the list just keeps going...</p>
<p>We are licensed suppliers to our registered members providing medicinal cannabis for over a year now. Our customers love our organic and hydroponic medicinal flower, fully lab tested and deemed ""Some of the cleanest cannabis in Canada."" Obviously we can't tell all of our secrets. The recreational side is now legalized Canada wide. We aim to target that massive market and supply everyone with the same Premium Medicinal Cannabis that we supply our patients. Not only do we grow some of the best Cannabis in Canada, we also produce our own honey oil, moonrocks, and will be introducing our own line of platinum quality solvent-less vaporizer pens.</p>
<p>We are very dedicated and driven to provide patients and customers with a very high quality product that you can depend on every time and a price that can't be beat!</p>
<p> </p>

<p>We are seeking $525,000 to secure and open a new recreation location in Ontario, Canada.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">- Mandatory Security for said location</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">- Start up Inventory</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">- Over Head / Running Costs</p>
<p>The profit margins on Cannabis when grown properly can be very profitable year round. We have a lot of connections with all of the edible and concentrate producers as well as other farmers and can provide products cheaper than our competition.  We have our own line of premium Honey Oil extract, Moon Rocks concentrate, and are currently developing our own line of Vaporizer pens that will be featured in <i>PURE CBD - SATIVA - HYBRID - INDICA</i> in 1000mg tanks with a few extra function perks such as three power setting, universal mini USB charging, Cold Filtered, and the highest quality distillate sourced.

My name is Jacob. I have researched and produced marijuana for over 20 years now. Medical marijuana and CPD oils has proven to be my leading form of natural medication. CPD oils has helped greatly with my chronic pain and arthritis over the past several years. Medical marijuana and CPD oils has helped our family and friends achieve positive health results and improved quality of life.  Pharmaceutical medications can cause permanent disfunction to the liver and kidneys which as a result can lead to severe health problems and ongoing treatment. The natural healing properties from cannabis are proven to help with mental health, disease and may even prevent cancer.  Medical Cannabis is known and proven to help with many forms of :
ADHD, BIPOLAR, ANXIETY, SLEEP APNIA, DEPRESSION, TUMORS, CANCER, SEIZURES, PARKENSONS DISEASE, HEADACHES, PTSD, EATING DISORDERS, the list just keeps going...
We are licensed suppliers to our registered members providing medicinal cannabis for over a year now. Our customers love our organic and hydroponic medicinal flower, fully lab tested and deemed ""Some of the cleanest cannabis in Canada."" Obviously we can't tell all of our secrets. The recreational side is now legalized Canada wide. We aim to target that massive market and supply everyone with the same Premium Medicinal Cannabis that we supply our patients. Not only do we grow some of the best Cannabis in Canada, we also produce our own honey oil, moonrocks, and will be introducing our own line of platinum quality solvent-less vaporizer pens.
We are very dedicated and driven to provide patients and customers with a very high quality product that you can depend on every time and a price that can't be beat!
 

We are seeking $525,000 to secure and open a new recreation location in Ontario, Canada.
Funding will go towards:

The profit margins on Cannabis when grown properly can be very profitable year round. We have a lot of connections with all of the edible and concentrate producers as well as other farmers and can provide products cheaper than our competition.  We have our own line of premium Honey Oil extract, Moon Rocks concentrate, and are currently developing our own line of Vaporizer pens that will be featured in PURE CBD - SATIVA - HYBRID - INDICA in 1000mg tanks with a few extra function perks such as three power setting, universal mini USB charging, Cold Filtered, and the highest quality distillate sourced. With the production of our own Cannabis Flower, Extracts, Concentrate and Vaperizor Pens it gives us a major advantage over any of our competition.

<p>In an effort to sustain as a women entrepreneur I realized that it was time to form a solid collective of like-minded individuals who as a unit could move in power and truly maintain healthy, mentally sound, successful businesses. Time 2 Launch was formed from that need, a women’s entrepreneurial incubator that supports women of color in every area.  Time 2 Launch has become a dynamic support system offering access and resources to promotion, production, manufacturing, research, marketing and sales amongst many other useful tools. Our dilemma however is our access to funding to launch or re-launch the businesses in the incubator on a larger platform. Without proper funding to start off with, most of these women will still maintain 9 to 5’s making it extremely difficult to invest one hundred per cent of a creative drive into the startup.</p>
<p>     Most of our members have applied for loans, grants and angel investors and have found that similar and identical platforms have been fully funded but for minority women it has been extremely difficult to secure startup capital.  It’s a fact that only through having sufficient start up capital, consulting, support and mentorship, individuals that have dreams of building businesses that drive economic growth will thrive and those without will suffer many unfortunate hardships. In a New York Times article Dell Gines, the author of an intriguing new <a href=""https://www.kansascityfed.org/community/smallbusiness/black-women-business-startups"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">report</a> from the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, <i>Black Women Business StartUps,</i> loves this quote attributed to Reid Hoffman, co-founder of LinkedIn: “An entrepreneur is someone who will jump off a cliff and assemble an airplane on the way down.” But for black women entrepreneurs, Gines quickly adds, “they do it with only a toothpick and a napkin.” What he means is that black women entrepreneurs typically lack the resources and capital to launch, yet take-off they do — in droves. According to <a href=""https://about.americanexpress.com/files/doc_library/file/2018-state-of-women-owned-businesses-report.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>The 2018 State of Women-Owned Business Report</i></a> commissioned by American Express, while the number of women-owned businesses grew an impressive 58% from 2007 to 2018, the number of firms owned by black women grew by a stunning 164%, nearly three times that rate. There are 2.4 million African American women-owned businesses in 2018, most owned by women 35 to 54. Black women are the only racial or ethnic group with more business ownership than their male peers, according to the Federal Reserve. But not everything about being a black women entrepreneur is so rosy. </p>
<p>American Express found that the gap is widening between the average revenue for businesses owned by women of color and those owned by non-minority women. For women of color, average revenue dropped from $84,000 in 2007 to $66,400 in 2018, while for non-minority businesses, revenue rose from $181,000 to $212,300. And the gap between African American women-owned businesses' average revenue and all women-owned businesses, Amex found, is the greatest. We absolutely know why that is, the access to good START-UP funding and the ability to commit the proper amount of time towards the business. We’re fundraising for several reasons,</p>
<ol>
<li>To gift each minority women entrepreneur in our mini doc  1500.00 to 5,000 dollars in start-up, launch or re-launch funding.</li>
<li>To provide by purchasing or leasing a building/space for all women to create, meet, manufacture,  train youth, exchange ideas, workshop, hold events, retail and to co-op the goods being produced.</li>
</ol>
<p>  These women and many like them have created dynamic business plans, great start-ups and amazing ventures that are awesome, sustainable energies for our communities!  With your help we may push further by supplying more resources that will catapult these women’s efforts and help sustain them longer with the funding that is so needed!  We’re everything as a community and most definitely have the means to support this fundraiser. We ask that you please donate, donate and donate again, share, share and share again. Be excited with us that such a thing is happening in our communities and as we grow we may be the resource that helps you achieve your start-up dream. Thank you in advance.</p>

Please visit our website for more details - intheferns.org We've been digging holes, wood chipping paths, climbing trees, tending the earth, meeting wild boars, setting boundaries with raccoons and rescuing dragonflies from tent flaps. We've been listening to the calls of owls and distant barking of coyotes. We've been stung by bees and devoured by mosquitos. We've been having sex in the dirt, under the night sky, on sloped ground in poorly pitched tents. We've been dancing until the sun came up, a hundred times over. We have been walking and walking and walking through the ferns, on every trail and wild sanctuary on this land. With hundreds of combined years of LOVE AND WORK on this patch of earth, In The Ferns Womyn's Cultural Trust Collective holds many kinds of knowledge about the land. We want to keep growing with it. We want to grow it with you. In the Ferns Womyn’s Cultural Trust is a collective dedicated to preserving the herstories of the land of the Michigan Womyn’s Music Festival. Our vision is to build upon the energies of this herstory and to create an ever growing and vital community space for all women into future generations. We welcome and celebrate the inclusion of all trans*, intersex and gender diverse wymmin.We have intentionally started small with our outreach, building trust and gathering momentum among the Michfest community; making sure we have a strong conscious foundation to expand our effort. We are ready to expand our outreach efforts now and we need your support.We are working to purchase the land; to create a financially sustainable, ecologically healthy, socially just and visionary place. We will continue to build upon the years of dedicated, heart and soul work and community building that the Michfest community has created over the past 40 beautiful years.We are not recreating Michfest but instead imagining a new future with deep roots.

<p>Let’s do this!  If you are reading this you are already one step closer to helping a sustainable event planning business grow and flourish in an area lacking that option.  Kristina is blending all of her diverse professional background from being a jewelry designer to organizing events for the large companies she worked for into a sustainable event business.  It may have taken a little longer than some, but she has found her calling.</p>

<p>I am hoping my years of crafting will help springboard my new business by my handmade goods.  It all started 2009-2012 designing jewelry for a company in the SF Bay Area which got me exploring stationary and invitations.  More and more family and friends were requesting my invitations and handmade cards, and that led to them asking about helping them with parties.  Now into 2015, Savory and Juicy Design was born and began actively making invitations, greeting cards, planning weddings and private events for all sorts of people.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1482380137/jxmnauervxd6m85l8wsa.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>All the handmade goods are made by @savoryandjuicy and consist of greeting card stationary, invitations, earrings, mala bead necklaces, and mason jar cozy’s.  The greeting cards &amp; the jewelry will be a secret mixed bag of handcrafted beauties (see photos to get an idea of style).  Enjoy being fashionably sustainable by bringing your own mason jar cozy to your favorite coffee shop. Check out the beautiful printed fabrics (fleece or wool editions). Kristina Olson’s Gatherings will be the event planning business name and offering event planning packages through this crowd-sourcing campaign as well.  The early stages she will be running her event business through properties in San Luis Obispo, CA area and move towards getting property where she will convert the land back to native plants and develop the property to support off grid systems.  But we are getting ahead of ourselves...</p>
<h2>Let me support you while you entertain!</h2>
<p>Why crowd-sourcing the goods?  Each person that provides support, will get Kristina Olson’s Gatherings one step closer to making the business financially sustained.  Kristina had this to say:</p>
<p>“Following a dream, from two years ago, I felt I was supposed to move in the direction of having my own event business.  So now it’s 2016.  I sold everything, and left my job up in the Bay Area to convert land into a sustainable off the grid event space in San Luis Obispo County.  After doing extensive research and seeing grand opportunity because this is a destination location for weddings and events, why not incorporate my knowledge in sustainability &amp; fitness events.   I believe sustainability minded companies and ideas are the new wave of the future that we are already starting to see that impact on all sorts of different fields.”</p>
<h3><strong style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 24px;letter-spacing: 0px;line-height: 30px;"">Who you are getting...</strong></h3>
<p>Kristina has immersed herself in Worldly and community causes before.  When she lived in San Luis Obispo (SLO) she was one of three key organizers for Earth Day Celebration downtown for three years, while she was the president of the Wildlife Club for Cal Poly.  She reinstated the program upon her arrival at Cal Poly and while president she planned many community events on campus, as well as, events in the local area.  She got her degree in Systematic Biology and Ecology at Cal Poly so she knows the area and demographic well.  While she was going through school she went to massage school to pay for college and continued as a side career for 15 years. Whenever it was feasible she blended the other companies she worked at or volunteered for to work together to have a greater impact in the community.  </p>
<p>She then lived in Zambia, Africa and was one of 6 people in charge of overseeing the water project within that country for four years.  She then moved to Australia and continued working with events and building communities.  When she moved back to the states in 2007 she organized local events for the companies that she worked for, as well as, private events.  Now for the last three years she has remained planning and organizing private events such as parties, local community events, weddings and showers on the side of her full time job.   </p>

<h3><strong>What is needed and how your money is going to be used...</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>$12,600 </strong></h3>
<p>Kristina has personally contributed $15,000.  She is in need of an additional $12,600 to help fund her event business for the next 6 months.  The funds will be used for the office rental each month, rental space of prime property in Arroyo Grande to perform various events, insurance and a fast updated website. </p>
<p><strong>Some have wanted the breakdown:</strong></p>
<p>$800 Property rental each month</p>
<p>$460 Office rental each month</p>
<p>$990 Upgraded website - hire out</p>
<p>$1,100 Inspirational shoot with local vendors</p>
<p>$2,600 New social media plan implemented and local marketing - hire out</p>
<p>$350 Internet</p>
<p>TOTAL $12600</p>
<p>The success of this campaign will help support several local small businesses through the yoga popup festivals that Kristina Olson’s Gatherings plans to host there.  Along with helping small local businesses, KO’s Gathering plans to continue acting on its social responsibility mission by giving back to the community, planting trees, transforming her company to be more sustainable and helping animal shelters.  She notices the need in the San Luis Obispo community for this type of unique space because there are only two other spaces like this in the entire SLO Central Coast County.  Along with that mission, she plans to restore an airstream trailer and make it as energy efficient as possible.  She will then move that trailer onto some land in the next 3 years where she will start to build her eco-retreat space to use for events and education.  </p>
<p>Kristina finishes by saying, “This is the new American Dream for this California girl.  Maybe I was looking at this all wrong before?  There was all these hardships that kept coming at me, losing my father at a very young age, striving for the American Dream of working in a big company and owning a home but then the crash happened and I lost my full time job, house and then the major health issues came with that.  I kept thinking why is all this bad happening?   I just needed to step out of it and look at it differently.  Not as simple as it sounds.   I realized after years of constant trial that I was going about this all wrong.  Get back to your roots, live out your purpose.” </p>
<p>If the project is not fully funded she will find another way to make this a reality as she has selected the fixed funded option (if you don’t know what these means if not funding she will not get any money).  So in other words she is all in... if you are!  She appreciates all support even if you can’t give funds, sharing her cause is also meaningful!  </p>
<h3><strong>How you can help...</strong></h3>
<p>After making a contribution and getting one of the awesome perks, you can help by inviting friends, family and peers by sharing the campaign. Please back the project and tell everyone you know to help spread the word so Kristina Olson’s Gatherings can bring a bit of sparkle to one event at a time.</p>

The solution 

Bringing people globally in solidarity with each other, taking matters into our own hands, and supporting each other morally and financially.
We invest $1-25 each month in one single pool to support the people we care about each month.
The Aazer platform helps us generate a sustainable budget every month that is accessible to every member so that they can support their causes, beloved family members, friends, community or even themselves.
We have total control over the monthly budget and through a democratic voting process we collectively decide on how to use the monthly budget to develop ourselves and thrive.

You gain Credibility points from friends and members who credit you for your integrity, credibility, and honesty.
So don't try to risk your repetition by doing something stupid. Otherwise, all your network will know about it and then the whole world
Who will have access to the monthly budget?
Only members of the Aazer platform can have access to the monthly budget. Still every member is free to decide whether to ask for money to support himself or any other person among his network.
In other words, being a member will allow you to financially support your family, friends, your cause, your community or even yourself.",3.0,0,"2 Campaigns

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><div> <h3>Hi! I'm Jacqueline.</h3> <p align=""justify"">My first job was with one of those summer work programs when I was 16. Every year after that, I always worked at some time. I liked working and, luckily, there was never a year that passed when I was unemployed for that whole year. For me, that was what life was about. Working, studying, and enjoying my youth because as I got older it would be just about working. Sure, I saw a family in my future but in my mind I would always be a working mom.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Fast forward many years and I realized life wasn't just about working. Some of the jobs I had drained me physically but a lot of them also drained me mentally and emotionally. I liked working, but the jobs I held didn't make me happy. I worked as a receptionist, sales attendant, cashier, nail technician, waitress, camp teacher's assistant, clerical assistant, embarkation officer, interpreter, operations manager, and I can't remember what else, but they all made me feel that  something was missing from my life.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Fast forward some more years (and life lessons) and I found myself with a job that some may not have thought as a ""success""-type of employment, but I felt less stressed and I smiled more often. It was the first job I ever had that I could smile and say ""I love my job"" and actually mean it.</p>
<p align=""justify"">It's why, after having my rainbow baby and being allowed to take him to work with me, I cried like a child when I resigned. The stress (and tropical heat) I was putting my newborn through getting to work and back (on public transportation and walking) was too much for my heart to handle. I made the tough decision of becoming a stay-at-home-mom....and it has been the second best decision I've ever made (the first being becoming a mom).I've been a SAHM for some time now and I have loved every minute of it. I have been able to see every second of my king as he's grown and every day he surprises me with something new. </p>
</div>
<div> <h3>What I Would Like To Do</h3>
<p align=""justify"">I have always loved creating and after studying patternmaking after high school, I started exploring making other accessories. After becoming a SAHM, I realized I could dedicate nap time to creating and just making the ideas in my head into tangible things as well as looking into new techniques and medium. Now that my king is older, I feel like it's the right time to launch this business idea that's been going around in my head for such a long time. I've come up with different accessory ideas and have gotten the necessary information for some of those, but I think the best way to start is to start small. </p>
<p align=""justify"">Originally organized in the 1950s by a priest of the San José Church (to celebrate Saint Sebastian's feast day, raise funds for the parish, and restore San Sebastián Street), the ""Fiestas de la calle San Sebastián"" (San Sebastián Street Festival) is nowadays mostly known as the celebration that ends the Christmas holiday season. It is an annual 4-day event celebrated during the third weekend in January from Thursday to Sunday. It begins with the traditional mass dedicated to Saint Sebastian and includes other traditional festivities such as the ""cabezudos"" parade and traditional dancing. There's food, music, AND artisans selling their wares...and I think it's also the perfect place to launch.</p> </div>
<div> <h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get With Your Contribution</h3> <p>Because I would need stock to sell at the festival, most of the funds raised through this campaign will be used for inventory and replacement of nicked tools and equipment. I also need to register the business and pay the fees related to selling at the ""Fiestas de la calle San Sebastián"". </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3> <p>If I'm able to sell at the FCSS, it would be another check on my vision board. I know that it would be a step in the right direction to starting my home-based business, which is something I dream of just so that I can work ""with my baby on my hip"". The reason I am so intent on starting this business is because I would like to create a sustainable business that my king could be a part of and with your support I am pretty sure I can achieve that.</p>
</div> <div> <h3>What Are the Risks &amp; Challenges?</h3> <p> Like every business, no one can guarantee success. (Actually that goes true for everything in life, really.) But, being able to sell at this festival I can come in contact with my ideal customer and speak with them face to face. This will allow me to understand if I am not meeting their wants when it comes to fun eclectic accessories and if I am not, I can take that feedback and make adjustments to future items. </p>
</div> <div> <h3>Can't Contribute?</h3> <p>I've been there and totally understand. It doesn't mean you can't help, though. You can spread the word of my campaign to your friends, family...anyone. You can spread the word by:</p>

Each document that a customer receives from doityourselflegaldocs.com will be specific to the needs of the individual consumer.In the area of bankruptcy, Do It Yourself Legal Docs will offer complete consumer Chapter 7 Bankruptcy software that will identify the property exemptions for the State a customer resides in, without having to research any Federal Bankruptcy Codes or State Statutes. Do It Yourself Legal Docs will also provide links for consumer credit counseling courses which every debtor must take before filing bankruptcy. Doityourselflegaldocs.com will provide step by step virtual customer service assistance as well as real time professional legal assistance.Doityourselflegaldocs.com is confident it will offer its customers a new and innovating way online legal documents and services are delivered to the public.With financial instability still looming in the United States, I have dedicated the better part of twenty years to helping clients restore their businesses through the bankruptcy process and secure a future for their families through estate planning. doityourselflegaldocs.com will consolidate all of these functions into one website with an interactive customer service platform.We are currently in the final design and development phase for our website. We need backers to help us complete this phase and launch our website. Contributions will go directly into development and marketing.The idea that an online legal site can only provide fill-in-the-blank forms is completely outdated, today, multiple online legal sites give people the option of do-it-yourself or a technology enabled, attorney assisted service. Our own online process will work like Turbo Tax, where a customer answers a series of questions in an online interview, and that information is used to create a personalized last will. In most states, customers can have the will reviewed by a licensed attorney at no additional cost.""For middle income families, the high price of legal advice can provide a convenient excuse to put off something that nobody wants to think about anyway. Only about half of people earning less than $75,000 a year have a will, compared with about 64 percent of people with higher incomes. Many experts say that do-it-yourself estate planning is best suited for people with estates worth less than $2 million, the amount at which federal estate tax kicks in, and for people who are in first marriages with simple family situations. doityourselflegaldocs.com will provide thousands of low cost legal documents with software that gives simple instructions that can help consumers navigate the documents.How The Contributions Will Be UsedWe are currently in the final design and development phase for our website. We need backers to help us complete this phase and launch our website. Contributions will go directly into development and marketing. Once our campaign goal has been reach there will be weekly updates to all of our backers via email and invitations for scheduled Skype meetings on the progress of our website and marketing campaign before its official launch date, the funds will utilized as follows:
We have employed website engineers that will be able to develop a comparable industry standard online legal documents and services company.

<p><span style=""font-size: 24px;letter-spacing: 0px;""><b>What is it About?</b></span></p> <p>NewMan's Business Accelerator was founded 3 years ago by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/irenachaushevska"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Irena Chaushevska</a>, a thirty-something female entrepreneur in search for freedom and opportunity one to create and accomplish great things <b>STARTING FROM ANYWHERE</b> only with the resources he/she have. </p>
<p>She set NewMan's primary offices in her home country - Macedonia. Macedonia is a small country in South Eastern Europe where 90% of the young people speak English, science and technology are among the favourite subjects at school and robotics competitions one of the most attended. However, the number of completed tech products coming especially from the younger generations is very low, primarily due to lack of equipment and funding.</p>
<p>Irena traveled to US for a first time only 1,5 years before opening of NewMan's where she managed to set up meetings with representatives from JPL of NASA and NASA Ames Research Center, and now for the last 3 years she acts as a Local Lead for Skopje (Macedonia) at <b>the world biggest mass collaboration hackathon <a href=""https://2016.spaceappschallenge.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">NASA Space Apps Challenge</a></b>. The event takes place in around 170 cities around the world with a goal of producing relevant open-source solutions to address global needs applicable to both life on Earth and in Space.</p>
<p><b>The results and benefits from the event in the country are far beyond anything Irena could imagine.</b> </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1463244043/NASA_Space_Apps_Challenge_2014_xrm8rx.png"" src="""" style=""width: 574.4307692307692px;height: 381px;""/></p>
<b>Skopje became the city with highest number of projects worldwide in 2014</b>, 3 more cities from the country (Tetovo, Bitola and Ohrid) and 8 more from the region (Belgrade, Tirana, Pristina, Zagreb, Cluj, Ljubljana, Koper and Vienna) joined the event in 2015 and 2016 and this year one of the Skopje teams - AVIS was pre-selected among the TOP 25 by NASA judges in the People's choice category and it is <a href=""http://spaceappschallenge.org/awards"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">fighting for the 1st place in this moment</a>.

<br/><p><b>But what is more important is that through this event Irena managed to accomplish her initial idea - a young people from this region to start believe that they can do GREAT &amp; MEANINGFUL THINGS same as their peers from much more developed countries!!!</b></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3></h3>
<h3>Why a Prototyping Laboratory?</h3>
<p>Although the teams are achieving great results they don't have where and with what to continue to develop their projects into real life products in order to offer them to the local and global markets. They need fully functional prototyping laboratory along with tools and materials for research, development and testing.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1463246593/13130954_1010278295731612_6852969109321687102_o_js1dwz.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Irena strongly believes that this young people deserve a creative and functional place where they will be able to come and build together... all with different backgrounds, from different universities and high schools, with different personal stories, to be able to build together around the year same as they do for the 48 hours during the NASA Space Apps Challenge hackathon. </p>
<p><b>Irena wants the shine in their eyes and the smile on their faces to sparkle all year long, but also to help them to get off the ground their own start-up projects and companies more easily. </b><b>This is a project that will benefit many young people from the country on a short run but also the country economy as a whole on a long run.</b></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<h3><b>Why We Need Funding?</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>NewMan's will dedicate its full ground floor and backyard for this cause and will provide technical and initial mentoring and ongoing technical support for the teams, but the funds needed <b>to build and equip a modern and competitive prototyping laboratory</b> are much more than NewMan's or the students can afford. NewMan's is self-funded by selling entrepreneurship and job-specific trainings and it is not using any government or EU funds support.</p>
<p><b>The products that will be built within the Prototyping Laboratory with the funds received from this campaign will be sole ownership of the individuals and teams that created them and NewMan's will not have any ownership in them coming from the campaign funds.</b><br/></p>
<p>The campaign funds will be sufficient to cover the costs for equipment, utilities and operating supplies for period of 2 years when the teams should become able to contribute small amounts on a monthly basis toward the utilities and the operating supplies costs. If there is a need for further purchase of a new equipment NewMan's will make sure to identify additional opportunities and solutions in future.</p>
<p>Here is how the ground floor looks like now:</p>

<h3>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The Impact</span><br/>
</h3>
</div><div> <p></p>
<ol>
<li>Around <b>1000 young people (mainly High School and University Students) </b>would be able to benefit from the Prototyping Laboratory during 2 years period, to practice Design thinking methodologies, to Research, Prototype and Innovate. </li>
<li>
<b>The best 7 of them accompanied by the NewMan's team will travel to the Silicon Valley to meet peers from the School of Mechanical Engineering and d-School at Stanford University </b>and to learn about their Prototyping and Product development practices, but also to showcase their products in front of big tech companies and potential investors, and than transfer the lessons learned back to their peers in Macedonia.</li>
<li>
<b>Some of all these young people will eventually create fully functional  and profitable products and will build their businesses, their lives and maybe even this country economy around them!</b><br/>
</li>
<li>NewMan's will involve the users of the Prototyping Laboratory to develop together a business model beyond the 24 months period in order to continue to deliver benefits to the community.</li>
</ol>

<div>
<p></p>
<h3>Why Fixed Funding?</h3>
<p></p>
<div>We could easily chose Flexible funding and walkaway with whatever we raise. But we don't work like that. We don't want to get into situation of raising only 20.000 or 30.000 $ and being asked by the public to build the Prototyping Laboratory anyway... <b>We don't want to make off with your money with no hope of delivering on our promises neither to you - our contributors, neither to the one for whom we are doing this. It makes no sense to us. </b>
</div>
<div><b>Here is our Indiegogo budget breakdown (66.000$ in total):</b></div>
<div><ul>
<li>5.200$ for Prototyping Laboratory interior and office equipment</li>
<li>20.000$ for Prototyping Laboratory working equipment<br/>
</li>
<li>7.200$ for Prototyping Laboratory operating supplies for 24 months</li>
<li>16.800$ for 7 people for travel and accommodation in USA for 2 weeks</li>
<li>7.200$ for utilities for 24 months</li>
<li>3.600$ for snacks and representation costs for 24 months</li>
<li>6.000$ for the Indiegogo and bank transaction fees to receive the collected money</li>
</ul></div>
<div>We can not do it with less than 66.000$. So if we raise less in total, we will release all your money back.</div>
<div>
<p><b>NewMan's contribution budget breakdown <b>(32.000$ in total)</b>:</b></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>15.000$ for rent of the Prototyping Laboratory space for 24 months</li>
<li>17.000$ for a salary of 1 full-time employee in the Prototyping Laboratory who will provide technical support for the users, will help them operate with the equipment and will manage the operating supplies.</li>

NewMan's Business Accelerator was founded 3 years ago by Irena Chaushevska, a thirty-something female entrepreneur in search for freedom and opportunity one to create and accomplish great things STARTING FROM ANYWHERE only with the resources he/she have. 
She set NewMan's primary offices in her home country - Macedonia. Macedonia is a small country in South Eastern Europe where 90% of the young people speak English, science and technology are among the favourite subjects at school and robotics competitions one of the most attended. However, the number of completed tech products coming especially from the younger generations is very low, primarily due to lack of equipment and funding.
Irena traveled to US for a first time only 1,5 years before opening of NewMan's where she managed to set up meetings with representatives from JPL of NASA and NASA Ames Research Center, and now for the last 3 years she acts as a Local Lead for Skopje (Macedonia) at the world biggest mass collaboration hackathon NASA Space Apps Challenge. The event takes place in around 170 cities around the world with a goal of producing relevant open-source solutions to address global needs applicable to both life on Earth and in Space.
The results and benefits from the event in the country are far beyond anything Irena could imagine. 


Skopje became the city with highest number of projects worldwide in 2014, 3 more cities from the country (Tetovo, Bitola and Ohrid) and 8 more from the region (Belgrade, Tirana, Pristina, Zagreb, Cluj, Ljubljana, Koper and Vienna) joined the event in 2015 and 2016 and this year one of the Skopje teams - AVIS was pre-selected among the TOP 25 by NASA judges in the People's choice category and it is fighting for the 1st place in this moment. Read more for this project at Medium ""How a team of high schoolers reverse engineered a fitness trackers to control a drone?""


But what is more important is that through this event Irena managed to accomplish her initial idea - a young people from this region to start believe that they can do GREAT & MEANINGFUL THINGS same as their peers from much more developed countries!!!



Why a Prototyping Laboratory?
Although the teams are achieving great results they don't have where and with what to continue to develop their projects into real life products in order to offer them to the local and global markets. They need fully functional prototyping laboratory along with tools and materials for research, development and testing.


Irena strongly believes that this young people deserve a creative and functional place where they will be able to come and build together... all with different backgrounds, from different universities and high schools, with different personal stories, to be able to build together around the year same as they do for the 48 hours during the NASA Space Apps Challenge hackathon. 
Irena wants the shine in their eyes and the smile on their faces to sparkle all year long, but also to help them to get off the ground their own start-up projects and companies more easily. This is a project that will benefit many young people from the country on a short run but also the country economy as a whole on a long run.



Why We Need Funding?

NewMan's will dedicate its full ground floor and backyard for this cause and will provide technical and initial mentoring and ongoing technical support for the teams, but the funds needed to build and equip a modern and competitive prototyping laboratory are much more than NewMan's or the students can afford. NewMan's is self-funded by selling entrepreneurship and job-specific trainings and it is not using any government or EU funds support.
The products that will be built within the Prototyping Laboratory with the funds received from this campaign will be sole ownership of the individuals and teams that created them and NewMan's will not have any ownership in them coming from the campaign funds.
The campaign funds will be sufficient to cover the costs for equipment, utilities and operating supplies for period of 2 years when the teams should become able to contribute small amounts on a monthly basis toward the utilities and the operating supplies costs. If there is a need for further purchase of a new equipment NewMan's will make sure to identify additional opportunities and solutions in future.
Here is how the ground floor looks like now:






The Impact

 

Around 1000 young people (mainly High School and University Students) would be able to benefit from the Prototyping Laboratory during 2 years period, to practice Design thinking methodologies, to Research, Prototype and Innovate. 

The best 7 of them accompanied by the NewMan's team will travel to the Silicon Valley to meet peers from the School of Mechanical Engineering and d-School at Stanford University and to learn about their Prototyping and Product development practices, but also to showcase their products in front of big tech companies and potential investors, and than transfer the lessons learned back to their peers in Macedonia.

Some of all these young people will eventually create fully functional  and profitable products and will build their businesses, their lives and maybe even this country economy around them!

NewMan's will involve the users of the Prototyping Laboratory to develop together a business model beyond the 24 months period in order to continue to deliver benefits to the community.


    




Why Fixed Funding?

We could easily chose Flexible funding and walkaway with whatever we raise. But we don't work like that. We don't want to get into situation of raising only 20.000 or 30.000 $ and being asked by the public to build the Prototyping Laboratory anyway... We don't want to make off with your money with no hope of delivering on our promises neither to you - our contributors, neither to the one for whom we are doing this. It makes no sense to us. 

Here is our Indiegogo budget breakdown (66.000$ in total):

5.200$ for Prototyping Laboratory interior and office equipment
20.000$ for Prototyping Laboratory working equipment

7.200$ for Prototyping Laboratory operating supplies for 24 months
16.800$ for 7 people for travel and accommodation in USA for 2 weeks
7.200$ for utilities for 24 months
3.600$ for snacks and representation costs for 24 months
6.000$ for the Indiegogo and bank transaction fees to receive the collected money

We can not do it with less than 66.000$. So if we raise less in total, we will release all your money back.

NewMan's contribution budget breakdown (32.000$ in total):


15.000$ for rent of the Prototyping Laboratory space for 24 months
17.000$ for a salary of 1 full-time employee in the Prototyping Laboratory who will provide technical support for the users, will help them operate with the equipment and will manage the operating supplies.

PaPRikaMy name is Ines Marić and I am the Founder of
PaPRika, a startup event management agency in Zagreb, Croatia. We specialize in organizing and producing all kinds of corporate and
private events, but our main goal is to organize green events which will make
Croatia a better place!The main feature of green eco events has a
positive impact on the planet, local community and the people around us. There
are many areas in which we can and must have a positive impact:
eco-procurement, waste reduction and management, energy efficiency, water
conservation, reduced emissions, biodiversity conservation, and social and
economic development. Our mission is to raise awareness of these obligations,
but also point out ecological modernization of environment in which we live. Croatia is as many of you know, small and
beautiful country, but it is still going through the transition process. The
Croatian economy is in crisis. Unemployment is high, corruption is pervasive
and for many people, life in Croatia is not so easy. I have lived in Zagreb my
whole life and after many years of struggle, I felt that I needs to do
something. I wanted to start a company with a sustainable and helping mission.We want to make changes. We want to give
people something positive. We want to make Croatia a better place to live and a
better place to visit!The
ImpactEko Limach Fest
Your financial support will help us to
organize our first green project – Eko Limach Fest.In September 2015 and June 2016, we are planning
to organize a children's eco festival in Park Maksimir, Zagreb in order to educate the young people on the protection of the
environment and nature. Also, the children would be educated about other
important topics that would be part of other workshops, and all would be
accompanied by an entertainment program, as well as sports activities.Why Eko
Limach Fest?


Because it is the first real children's eco
outdoor festival in Croatia


Because it is based on all day interaction
of children who pass through various eco, creative and educative workshops and
create them


Because the main goal is to educate and to
raise environmental awareness amongst the young


Because it promotes health and a healthy,
active lifestyle


Because it educates about healthy eating
habits


Because it fosters the mental health of
children


Because it promotes the welfare and wellbeing of animals


Because it will provide children basic
knowledge about the nature and explain the importance of co-existence and
harmony between humans and nature


Because it is an ideal project to raise
environmental awareness among younger generations


Because it promotes outdoor activities and
Park Maksimir


Because the eco-educational workshops and
other entertainment will be provided for those with low-income





This
kind of festival will be organized for the first time in Croatia and admission
for all visitors is free. We expect to have several thousands of children and
their parents join us.



The
awareness of ecology is still very low in Croatia so this kind of project is

<h3>Pricklypear - A Place To Be!</h3>
<p>Io sono Bonaventura Poppiti e insieme ai miei amici e collaboratori abbiamo deciso di unire le nostre competenze, in ambito<strong> musicale</strong>,<strong> informatico</strong> e di <strong>marketing</strong> per lanciare un nuovo business, con sede operativa ad <strong>Altavilla Silentina</strong> (SA), pensato per fornire a chi vuole fare musica tutti i servizi e gli strumenti di cui ha bisogno e allo stesso tempo creare una<strong> rete di contatti</strong> che permetta loro di farsi conoscere acquisendo visibilità. </p>
<p>Abbiamo deciso di creare uno spazio sia fisico che on-line, per musicisti e amatori. Un luogo dove poter essere finalmente quello che si vuole. ""A Place To Be! ""</p>

<p> </p>
<p>L’idea si sviluppa attraverso due grandi nodi:</p>
<p>- una parte off-line relativa alla creazione di uno<strong> studio di registrazione/sala prove</strong></p>
<p>- una parte on-line attraverso l’implementazione di un <strong>sito web</strong> e un’<strong>applicazione per smartphone</strong>. </p>
<p>Se la prima è un’attività che possiamo definire “<strong>tradizionale</strong>”, la seconda si lega indissolubilmente all’<strong>innovazione</strong>.</p>
<p>L’applicazione permetterà ad esempio di:</p>
<p>- vendere ed acquistare basi musicali</p>
<p>-richiedere la realizzazione di video e grafiche</p>
<p>-richiedere il supporto di esperti per la realizzazione di campagne pubblicitarie</p>
<p>-richiedere mastering e mixing di brani</p>
<p>-interagire con altri musicisti e attività commerciali</p>
<p>-prenotare lo studio di registrazione</p>
<p>-l'incontro tra domanda e offerta di performance musicali.</p>

<h3>Di cosa abbiamo bisogno e cosa avrai in cambio?</h3>

<p>In cambio del vostro supporto abbiamo pensato a dei fantastici doni!</p>
<p>Le<strong> ricompense</strong> che abbiamo scelto sono:</p>
<p>- Ringraziamento tramite <strong>e-mail</strong></p>
<p>- Un<strong> jingle musicale</strong>, da noi prodotto, che verrà donato a chiunque effettui una donazione di importo pari o superiore a 1 euro.  Questo avrà durata di 20 secondi.  Potrete usarlo come base per i vostri video o come suoneria per il vostro cellulare</p>

<p>- <strong>Felpa Pricklypear- A Place To Be</strong>. Disponibile in 5 versioni. Rock, Pop, Rap, Punk e Myself. L'immagine posizionata al centro della felpa raffigurerà una di queste parole. Anche in questo caso, per sceglierla basterà mandarci una mail.</p>
<p>- <strong>Zaino Pricklypear</strong>. Zaino personalizzato con il logo di Pricklypear</p>
<p>- <strong>Your song</strong>. Solo 5 disponibili. Una canzone che sarà veramente tua. Potrai farne quello che vuoi. Quante volte nella vita potrà mai capitarti un'occasione simile?</p>
<p>- <strong>5 Video tutorial per chitarra e batteria</strong>. Anche in questo caso la scelta sta a voi. Mandateci una mail e scegliete il set di tutorial che preferite.

<h3>The Story</h3>
<p>My name is Rebecca Fernandez.  I am a storyteller.  The story I am going to tell is of a young Silicon Valley couple attempting to buy their first home.  The journey begins in Milpitas California and ends with a hopeful purchase of a home in the San Joaquin Valley.  </p>
<p>We do not know what the ultimate ending will be, but we do know that millions of young people are in the process of thinking about whether they should buy a home and if/when they can do it.  This documentary is full emotions which will take our viewers on a journey of a lifetime that will feel like an emotional rollercoaster.  They will experience fear, excitement, self doubt, joy and often times, sadness and frustration.  </p>
<p>The end result, like a sporting event, is not predetermined.  This is REAL LIFE and there are no actors.    </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>We need $215.35 for gas money to get from site to site!  In addition to the gas money, we need $1,100+tax for a high quality digital camera; which will be purchased USED on eBay, $400+ for a website designer, and $1,575 to produce our step-by-step guide to homeownership (which will be a companion piece to the YouTube documentary.  Any additional funds raised will go directly toward the campaign.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Many people believe that they can dive headlong into homebuying without any prior eduction on the process.  This is flat wrong!  There are MANY people on the internet who claim you can purchase homes at &lt;60% of the homes value.  This is 100% FALSE in the current housing market.  There is a housing shortage and many people are paying a premium to the listing price.  </p>
<p>This is why we do not know the final outcome of this project.  Will this Silicon Valley couple actualize their dream of home ownership or will they be relegated to renting forever?  Our goal is to guide this young couple and provide them and all of their followers with the necessary tools to achieve homeownership.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>This project will not only address the common challenges with buying a first home; it will also tackle the challenges that COVID-19 has presented.  Home buying has been transformed and you will get a first-hand account of the struggles first-time home buyers are experiencing.  </p>
<p>It will also provide the actual ups and downs of a real estate transaction in REAL TIME!  This is NOT a get-rich-quick scheme or a fantasy or 'reality TV show' like you would see on HGTV where the outcome is already determined.  </p>
<p>We have ZERO knowledge of the eventual outcome.  What we do know is that when you have finished watching the series, you will be equipped with the knowledge and confidence to approach the home buying experience without fear or trepidation.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Whether you are able to contribute monetarily or not, we appreciate word of mouth referrals.  If you happen to know anyone that this project would help, please send them our way.  </p>

advocate. Passionate about health and wellness since an early age, I have experience in marathon and group fitness training. Nowadays, I utilize my degrees in education and information science to enhance my research and to
teach my greatest passion ‒ yoga. I am excited to embark
on my latest and greatest endeavor – Clairity Out Loud, so that I may share
with others the opportunity to cultivate self-love and confidence, through the
practice of yoga, meditation, and the use of natural food and products to remember or attain our true self.</div><div>For the next 30 days, I am looking to raise the funding for our space to practice, meet, create, and gather so that we have the location for making the business a success. We need money to put down on purchasing the space, making some minor maintenance adjustments, and purchasing supplies to get products, classes and sessions going right away - and then we will have an ideal location, starting materials, and a beautiful space - to start impacting the local community. With just a little help, we will make the move right into the heart of Downtown Las Vegas. </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>We need approximately $5000:</p>
<p>$3000 will be the remaining portion of the down payment on purchasing the space as a large portion is already saved and ready to go.</p>
<p>$1500 will go toward repairs, maintenance, and materials needed to run a successful class, create the products, and have a comfortable environment for any visitors and/ or practitioners. </p>
<p>$500 will be set aside for business licensing.</p>
<p>I am offering some great perks for participating - products, private sessions, consultations, and essential oils. Just for participating, you will have a first hand experience with some of the offerings to come as I move forward following my dream - and you will have a huge impact on seeing someone follow their passion! </p>
<p>Should the total amount not be reached, you will get your money back completely - 100% refunded. If we work as a community and make this happen, we start Clairity Out Loud with a bang! </p>

</div></div>","Short Summary My name is Clair Thomas and I am an educator and wellness
advocate. Passionate about health and wellness since an early age, I have experience in marathon and group fitness training. Nowadays, I utilize my degrees in education and information science to enhance my research and to
teach my greatest passion ‒ yoga. I am excited to embark
on my latest and greatest endeavor – Clairity Out Loud, so that I may share
with others the opportunity to cultivate self-love and confidence, through the
practice of yoga, meditation, and the use of natural food and products to remember or attain our true self.For the next 30 days, I am looking to raise the funding for our space to practice, meet, create, and gather so that we have the location for making the business a success. We need money to put down on purchasing the space, making some minor maintenance adjustments, and purchasing supplies to get products, classes and sessions going right away - and then we will have an ideal location, starting materials, and a beautiful space - to start impacting the local community. With just a little help, we will make the move right into the heart of Downtown Las Vegas.   What We Need & What You Get We need approximately $5000:
$3000 will be the remaining portion of the down payment on purchasing the space as a large portion is already saved and ready to go.
$1500 will go toward repairs, maintenance, and materials needed to run a successful class, create the products, and have a comfortable environment for any visitors and/ or practitioners. 
$500 will be set aside for business licensing.
I am offering some great perks for participating - products, private sessions, consultations, and essential oils. Just for participating, you will have a first hand experience with some of the offerings to come as I move forward following my dream - and you will have a huge impact on seeing someone follow their passion! 
Should the total amount not be reached, you will get your money back completely - 100% refunded. If we work as a community and make this happen, we start Clairity Out Loud with a bang! 
    The Impact 
Clairity Out Loud is a company dedicated to
helping people become clear about their life’s purpose through movement, meditation,
nutrition, and the use of essential oils to create (or purchase) all natural
healthcare and cleaning products. I believe that  gaining clarity is the first step toward
freedom. My life's purpose is to be a light that shines love to expose the cobwebs of fear; remind us that love makes us vulnerable but strengthens, while fear provides a sense of comfort, but weakens the spirit. Please help me shine that light!

<p>While IncBuzz has dozens of unique features which distinguish it from other business platforms, there are a few primary reasons that IncBuzz stands alone as the emerging leader of the business platform pack. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1141013/files/20150109201447-biz-profile-620.jpg?1420863287"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p>
<p>First and foremost, <b>IncBuzz is <i>focused on building the business entity </i></b>and the associated brand. Most business platforms focus on the individual and their specific resume, like <i>(linkedin).</i>  </p>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><i></i><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1141027/files/20150109203155-Apps-Install.jpg?1420864315"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
</span><p style=""text-align: center;""><b><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span></b></p>
<p style=""display: inline !important;""></p>
<b>
<h4 style=""display: inline !important; text-align: center;""></h4>
<h4 style=""display: inline !important; text-align: center;""></h4>
<h4>IncBuzz will offer an ever-expanding list of APPs to choose from. <br/><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Access them directly from your Dashboard.</span></b>
</h4></b><p></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Another Key Advantage, is that everything needed to run your business successfully, is ""at your fingertips"".  IncBuzz brings the business world to you. Access to the best business resources and tools are only a click away. Social integration is built in. </span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">You have the ability to</span><i style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> <b>control everything from one location</b>. </i><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The necessity of having to sign into multiple platforms on a continual basis will become obsolete. This will be accomplished, in part, through the use of installed apps, which is the future of software design.</span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">One of the features that definitely sets us apart from all competition is the Microsite, quite possibly one of the most innovative features to be developed.  It has the potential to completely change the way businesses create and manage their online presence. </span></p>

<br/><p></p>
<p><span><b></b></span></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: left;""><b>What is a Microsite?<span><br/></span></b></h3>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; text-align: center;"">A Microsite is a very unique, low cost alternative to owning a ""traditional website"", which will allow anyone to be the ""Master"" of their own site. First of all, forget the monthly hosting costs.  Forget the development costs and the forever ongoing maintenance costs.  A web developer is not something you will need (it will include easy to use Site Editor software).  You will have access to tools and analytics. It is HTML capable. You will have the ability to easily create your own site, change your site, the way you want, when you want, without involving anyone else.  You want E-Commerce, have your own online store? It's included.  NO ADDITIONAL COSTS (Everything is Included in your IncBuzz Premium or Pro Membership).</span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; text-align: center;"">Your site is built with the latest technology.  It is mobile compatible. You won't have to pay your developer $$$$ to ensure that everyone will be able to view it on all the different mobile devices and platforms out there.  The mobility doesn't stop there.  </span></p>
</div><div>Access and manage your site from an app on your phone (coming soon).  Making changes to your site are easy. Edit or add content, upload pictures, videos, install apps, widgets, you name it, do whatever you want on-the-go from your mobile device or computer, it's that simple. </div><div>

<h3>Where the Money Is Going</h3>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">The money
raised through the Indiegogo funding campaign will be used for design and development, finishing up final details of The IncBuzz Business Platform, which is complete and already online. Nearly all of the funding will be directed to the completion of development of the main features of the Premium and Pro Membership Packages being offered in our upcoming ""Official Launch"".  This will complete core revenue generating models and give us products to promote.  Up to this point, our company has been self-funded.  However, we understand, that for us to realize our potential and take our company to the next level, we need additional funding.  This is where your involvement is important. Without Indiegogo, and you, the contributor, we will not be able to accomplish the things we need to now, to ensure the future success of our new company, long-term.</span><br/>

In addition to keeping up with this demand for new features, we also understand the importance of marketing and promotion, getting the visibility and exposure needed to effectively grow the IncBuzz brand. And the urgency of not only getting it in front of as many potential customers as possible, but as quickly as possible. To do this we need the funding necessary to expand our resources, market our site and  promote our services, ensuring that every business owner truly understands the benefits of utilizing the IncBuzz Business Platform and its applications to grow their business.<br/>
</div>
</div></div>","IncBuzz is the Future of ""Everything Business""

It is a Unique, Ever-expanding, Mobile-compatible, Business Platform that will allow anyone the ability to control everything from their dashboard. 




 

 





Take multi-tasking to the highest level, saving you time and increasing productivity.  

Stay in touch, using multiple communication options and social media integration. 
Have access to the best business resources. 

Quickly and easily set up a successful, expandable, extremely affordable e-commerce business presence ALL FROM ONE LOCATION.



   



IncBuzz will minimize the need to have numerous sites and windows open to communicate and promote your product or service.

How Will We Do That?

As business owners and having worked with businesses of all types and sizes, we at IncBuzz, understand the need for the development of cost and time-saving business solutions designed to promote and grow businesses. By utilizing the latest in cutting-edge mobile and internet technologies, we can offer a unique and ever-expanding array of new features, resources, and services that are targeted at helping you achieve your business goals. 



IncBuzz has adopted a ""Mobile First"" design philosophy, building the platform and its applications using dynamic, mobile compatible software, which recognizes the type of device being used (desktop, laptop, tablet, mobile phone) and adjusts accordingly, allowing for a great user experience from any device. This type of  software architecture gives you complete control, and the ability to edit, update, and connect ""on-the-go"", making your hectic life, a lot less hectic. 


While IncBuzz has dozens of unique features which distinguish it from other business platforms, there are a few primary reasons that IncBuzz stands alone as the emerging leader of the business platform pack. 


First and foremost, IncBuzz is focused on building the business entity and the associated brand. Most business platforms focus on the individual and their specific resume, like (linkedin).  








IncBuzz will offer an ever-expanding list of APPs to choose from. Access them directly from your Dashboard.


Another Key Advantage, is that everything needed to run your business successfully, is ""at your fingertips"".  IncBuzz brings the business world to you. Access to the best business resources and tools are only a click away. Social integration is built in. 
You have the ability to control everything from one location. The necessity of having to sign into multiple platforms on a continual basis will become obsolete. This will be accomplished, in part, through the use of installed apps, which is the future of software design.
One of the features that definitely sets us apart from all competition is the Microsite, quite possibly one of the most innovative features to be developed.  It has the potential to completely change the way businesses create and manage their online presence. 





What is a Microsite?
A Microsite is a very unique, low cost alternative to owning a ""traditional website"", which will allow anyone to be the ""Master"" of their own site. First of all, forget the monthly hosting costs.  Forget the development costs and the forever ongoing maintenance costs.  A web developer is not something you will need (it will include easy to use Site Editor software).  You will have access to tools and analytics. It is HTML capable. You will have the ability to easily create your own site, change your site, the way you want, when you want, without involving anyone else.  You want E-Commerce, have your own online store? It's included.  NO ADDITIONAL COSTS (Everything is Included in your IncBuzz Premium or Pro Membership).
Your site is built with the latest technology.  It is mobile compatible. You won't have to pay your developer $$$$ to ensure that everyone will be able to view it on all the different mobile devices and platforms out there.  The mobility doesn't stop there.  
Access and manage your site from an app on your phone (coming soon).  Making changes to your site are easy. Edit or add content, upload pictures, videos, install apps, widgets, you name it, do whatever you want on-the-go from your mobile device or computer, it's that simple. 


Make your site unique by getting a .buzz domain.

IncBuzz, while housing many features to boost an individual’s personal accomplishments, is targeted at promoting and growing one’s business and not just their own resume. 
What about social integration? 

It's already there and ready to go.

IncBuzz users can make a post about their business within the platform while posting to and updating on other social networks at the same time with no additional effort. Comments and feedback from those external social networks also feed back into the Incbuzz platform without the need to open and manage multiple social networks.

IncBuzzMusic
The Incbuzz Music Player incorporates some of the features of very ""popular"" players already out there, but has several unique features, which set it apart from the rest, such as social media integration. Have more control and more fun in your music listening experience.





IncBuzz Featured At SmallGuy.com

SmallGuy is where you can find, buy, and experience new innovative products before they are sold in a retail marketplace or online stores.



Where the Money Is Going

The money
raised through the Indiegogo funding campaign will be used for design and development, finishing up final details of The IncBuzz Business Platform, which is complete and already online. Nearly all of the funding will be directed to the completion of development of the main features of the Premium and Pro Membership Packages being offered in our upcoming ""Official Launch"".  This will complete core revenue generating models and give us products to promote.  Up to this point, our company has been self-funded.  However, we understand, that for us to realize our potential and take our company to the next level, we need additional funding.  This is where your involvement is important. Without Indiegogo, and you, the contributor, we will not be able to accomplish the things we need to now, to ensure the future success of our new company, long-term.

Its  raison d'etre, which has developed over the years, is to make significant and sustainable revenue streams through creative business developments to spend on animal welfare and conservation.

<p>One of Orangutan Project's long term goals is to promote the concept of non-profit businesses - currently the primary, and sometimes only, goal of most companies is to increase the wealth of just a few individual people. We are showing that people will work for free and we can create businesses that give all of their profit away. This particular campaign is a drive to generate cash to develop a holiday resort on Borneo that will fund conservation work.</p>
<p>By contributing to this you will not only be funding a long-term revenue stream for animal conservation and welfare (it'll be like signing up for one of those '$10 a month' schemes, but you only have to donate this once!); you will also be showing your support for a business model that is not about shareholders and CEOs' bank accounts but instead using profits for the good of the world.

We are G.I. Junkers LLC.  A small, local, disabled Veteran owned general contracting business. We opened in July of 2018, And now employ 15 Men and Women.
This campaign was created to help our business grow to its full potential.   


What We Need & What You Get

We are asking for a funding of $50,000 all together to provide efficient amounts of supplies for our projects. And to send our employees home with a paycheck to provide for their families.
By choosing to contribute, you get a choice of a customized  G.I. junkers Short-Sleeved Tee shirt, Long sleeved Tee, Snap-Back embroidered baseball cap, or a hoodie!  
If our campaign doesn't reach its entire goal, We will still be thrilled and utilize any donations received.


The Impact
Our campaign helps in the success story of two disabled veterans making a difference by building value back into our community instead of becoming just another statistic.

<h5>Everyone loves chocolate...</h5>
<h5>I love making chocolate...</h5>
<p>Hi. I'm Andrew Miller, the creator of <i><b>Kakau Chocolat</b></i>. Thanks for visiting and considering a contribution to help get some great chocolate out on the market.<br/></p>
<p>I actually loathe chocolate... at least, what I really loathe is what is commercially available and sold as “chocolate”... you know, that stuff made from reconstituted cocoa powder, additives and fillers that's on every store shelf...</p>
<p></p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1460142069/beach1_jwpctv.png"" src="""" style=""width: 480px;height: 205px;""/><p></p>
<p>What I totally adore is <i>pure chocolate</i>, and that's the stuff that  is 'pure' – straight from the cocoa bean and into the bar... though I do have to admit that having made pure artisanal chocolate while developing the <i><b>Kakau Chocolat</b></i>  idea that that love has actually disappeared... you know, too much of a good thing, yada yada yada... but that love has turned into an absolute appreciation for <i>Theobroma Cacao</i> – <i>Food of the Gods</i> – which is Nature's way of saying 'hey, go
ahead and enjoy – it really is good for you!!'</p>

<h4><br/></h4>
<h4>From Engineer to
Chocolatier</h4>
<p>
Prior to returning to Fiji in 2012 after many
years abroad, I was chatting with a mate of mine in São Luís,
Brazil, about what to do on my return, and in a fit of verbosity he
said, “Fiji has cacao, right?' I concurred, having seen the pods
and eaten their beans all over the place as a kid. 'Well, go back and
start a chocolate factory,' Wladimir opined. 'Simple, now all I have
to do is learn what to do...' 'That's easy,' he said, fumbling for
his phone and making a call. Five minutes later, it was 'Done.'  And
so I spent the next eight months prior to my departure on cacao
farms and on courses, processing the beans and learning how to make real
chocolate... in between winding down my other work.</p>
<p>
The idea behind <b><i>Kakau Chocolat</i></b>  was born.</p>
<p></p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1460142318/savusavu_1_h438gj.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 480px;height: 194px;""/>
<p></p>
<h4><br/></h4>
<h4>What's on the
Menu?</h4>
<p>
Working with both the farmers and the
Ministry of Agriculture here in Fiji, I ensure that only the finest
of Fiji's Cacao gets through the front door. As I am going for
<i>Organic</i>
 and <i>FairTrade</i>
Certification, the whole process is vital, from growing, harvesting,
fermenting and drying the beans right through to being able to
wrap and package a chocolate that will enable my customers
to agree with one of my marketing tags: <i>Pacific
Perfection, All Chocolate, Pure Bliss...</i></p>
<p>
An initial range of 41gr., (1.5oz.)
Tablettes in a variety of chocolate percentages from 55% to 90%,
along with 150gr. (5.3oz.) Kraft Packs of Brewing Cacao is what will
be available from the start. Slowly adding a wide variety of flavours
to my Tablette repertoire (fresh chilli, basil, coriander, mint,
citrus, and even coconut for the short-list!), I will be expanding to
include pure cocoa butter, pure cocoa powder, and even potpourri,
utilising Fiji's vast wealth of flora and scents. And, hey, just wait
for my coconut chocolate liqueur range – that will top everything
on the market!</p>
<p>
I hope that you will come along with
me at <i><b>Kakau Chocolat</b></i>  and enjoy the ride...</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h4>What We Need and
What You Get</h4>
<p>
It's a totally new idea in Fiji. The project total is
pretty evenly divided between set-up costs and equipment
requirements. A full project breakdown is in the available business
plan.</p>
<p></p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1460143416/Pie_Chart_vcez8a.png"" src="""" style=""width: 380px;height: 293px;""/>

<p>As for our

enough to have his help in creating my perks... and, heck, what perks
- who doesn't want, or know someone who wants, a pearl!! Listed below
are contributing levels and the reward packages … a low $50 gets
you a grade-A pearl (valued at $65)... Go for it – nothing
like a pearl to go with the chocolate!! (Or is it a chocolate to go
with the pearl?)</p>

Level One :  Cacao-Pearl Prime  -  $750<br/>1 x Fiji Pearl
(Grade AAA) &amp; 4 x 350gr. (12.4oz.) <i>Koko ni Viti</i>  Brewing

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>

<p>
Level Six : Vinaka Vakalevu  -  $5<br/>A big
Vinaka Vakalevu from Fiji.</p>
<p>
As a contributor, and you're heading to the beautiful islands of Fiji for a
holiday? Then let us know and you'll have a gift pack waiting for you
when you arrive!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h4><b>More or Less</b></h4>
<p>
Any additional funding will go towards my establishing a centralised processing base in the Northern
Division for local cacao farmers to use to process their beans with
the appropriate bio-security controls in place for export
consideration, thereby ensuring that each farmer receives the benefit
of as much value-added factor as possible. If
the funding target is not achieved, there will be cut-backs on what is
done to get the facility up and running... it will still definitely
happen, but maybe just a little less-equipped than anticipated on
reaching the funding target.</p>
<p></p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1460143687/savusavu_5_v5bhfm.png"" src="""" style=""width: 480px;height: 319px;""/>
<p></p>
<h4><b>Is the Facility
Ready</b></h4>
<p> I currently have an option on a perfect location, which needs minimal work to have it ready and approved. Available from the middle of May, it will be fully operational within three weeks; the
majority of the work being the installation of air conditioning,
the construction of the bench tops and panelling of the walls.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<h4><b>What are the
risks</b></h4>
<p>
As with any new venture idea, there will always be
risks. However, having spent a substantial amount of time in the
development of the idea and the various types of chocolate, the
operational aspects are well known. Marketing the product - hey, with over 40,000 visitors annually  to Savusavu, that won't be a problem!</p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<h4><br/></h4>
<h4><b>Other ways to
help</b></h4>
<p>
Some people just can't contribute, but that
doesn't mean you can't help... If you believe in chocolate, please
share this on your social media. If that isn't your thing, simply
tell a friend about <i><b>Kakau Chocolat</b></i>. The more exposure, the better!</p>

As a contributor, and you're heading to the beautiful islands of Fiji for a
holiday? Then let us know and you'll have a gift pack waiting for you
when you arrive!

More or Less

Any additional funding will go towards my establishing a centralised processing base in the Northern
Division for local cacao farmers to use to process their beans with
the appropriate bio-security controls in place for export
consideration, thereby ensuring that each farmer receives the benefit
of as much value-added factor as possible. If
the funding target is not achieved, there will be cut-backs on what is
done to get the facility up and running... it will still definitely
happen, but maybe just a little less-equipped than anticipated on
reaching the funding target.



Is the Facility
Ready
 I currently have an option on a perfect location, which needs minimal work to have it ready and approved. Available from the middle of May, it will be fully operational within three weeks; the
majority of the work being the installation of air conditioning,
the construction of the bench tops and panelling of the walls.



What are the
risks

As with any new venture idea, there will always be
risks. However, having spent a substantial amount of time in the
development of the idea and the various types of chocolate, the
operational aspects are well known. Marketing the product - hey, with over 40,000 visitors annually  to Savusavu, that won't be a problem!




Other ways to
help

Some people just can't contribute, but that
doesn't mean you can't help... If you believe in chocolate, please
share this on your social media. If that isn't your thing, simply
tell a friend about Kakau Chocolat. The more exposure, the better!

<p>As previously stated, Conroy’s Gun Shop is comprised of a husband and wife team.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My name is Jennifer Conroy, I am the Owner and CEO of this establishment and I work alongside my husband, Chris Conroy, whom is the General Manager and Owner of our brain child. We have been working on getting this Business off the ground for over ten years and have gone through vigorous situations that have not allowed us to take the final step (obtaining seed capital). We have attained our FFL, recently, to manufacture ammunition and deal in firearms, as well as gone through several formal training programs to get us up-to-date in North Carolina’s gun laws to ensure the proper running, and safety, of our business. In so doing, we have exhausted our resources and need your help to make this dream become a reality.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We are in search of $750,000 dollars to get the ball rolling. This amount will help us establish ourselves in our own building, in a metropolitan area with heavy traffic (Asheville), in our beautiful gun friendly state (North Carolina). The sum will also allow us to relocate and obtain inventory, cases, payroll, company vehicles (for gun shows), marketing, office/operation supplies, utilities, insurance, and company phones. We have dedicated so much time and money into this project and this is the closest that we have ever been to becoming our own business. If we are unable to reach our entire goal within a timely manner, we will use the funds as an anchor to apply for and receive business loans. Regardless of whether or not we reach our startup goal, the money will be put to good use to establish our company and ensure our success.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The impact of your contribution is straight forward: you are making our life-long dream become a reality. By assisting us with starting our own business you are helping the economy of Western North Carolina and the State, and you’re encouraging the education and of the second amendment. The eventuality of our efforts is to expand our storefront into a shooting range and concealed carry instruction area. We are adamant about sharing our knowledge of gun ownership and safety with those willing to learn about our rights as US citizens.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>One of the main barriers that we will face in our field is competition; living in a gun friendly State gives plenty of opportunity for other like-minded individuals to start their own gun shops. We have a plan to sell our inventory of firearms 10 to 15 percent less than average market value. The only other barrier that stands in our way from success is robbery, which will easily be combated with professional security systems and armed, informed, and educated employees (including ourselves).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We hope that you consider us and contribute to our campaign. Please feel free to share our campaign on all social media (we will be doing the same). Thank you for your time and consideration.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>I am a professional property investor in London with over 12 years experience in the field. I have built a personal portfolio worth millions of pounds in London. I started as an estate agent many years ago, shortly after I opened my own estate agency which became, and still is, very successful. Through building a large network of high quality contacts, my power team is one of the main advantages I have in being able to source high return, high yielding investment properties. Knowing how difficult it is to start up in property, I decided to make it easier for people to get onto the property ladder, not requiring a large upfront capital investment, whilst still benefiting from a wealth of valuable experience and an exceptional contact network which has been built over the last 12  years. I have sourced, purchased, and refurbished numerous projects both small and large scale taking a run down property and refurbishing it to a high standard in areas set for good capital growth, thereby ensuring £100k + equity is gained with each project. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>You will receive your full initial investment back plus 6% pa interest (calculated at 0.5% interest per month), repaid to you at the end of the project which is estimated to run for between 12-24 months. E.g. If investing £10,000:</p>
<p>£10,000 x 0.5% per month x 24 months = £1200 plus £10,000 initial investment = £11,200 repaid </p>
<p>We are looking for funding to purchase a residential freehold property located in an area of London with excellent capital growth and high yielding rental returns. The property will be converted using a team of highly skilled and experienced contractors from a residential 3 bed house into a high specification 6 bedroom multi let House of Multiple Occupation (HMO) which will be let to young professional tenants seeking good quality housing. Total investment required for this refurbishment project is £175,000 which will be used for finance/purchase costs and refurbishment.</p>
<p>Below are the figures in more detail:</p>
<p>Purchase price: £400,000</p>
<p>Finance &amp; Refurbishment Cost: £175,000</p>
<p>Value after refurbishment: £675,000</p>
<p>Equity Gained: £100,000</p>
<p>Rental Income: £4500 PCM </p>
<p>Gross Yield: 13.5%</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This project will create high quality accommodation to young professionals in an area where there is a shortage of good quality housing. Being in close proximity to the new Crossrail Station as well as being in an area benefitting from millions of pounds worth of regeneration means the project is low risk and offers excellent returns due to the uplift in value and high rental return. Having recently completed 3 other similar projects in the same vicinity our investors expectations have been exceeded and they are very pleased with their investment.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Investing in property is not without risk, the value of a property can increase as well as decrease dependent on the market however your investment is secured against the property and with my experience in this immediate market the risk is minimised and this is justified by independent reports of property prices being at an all time low and future forecasts set to drastically increase over time, with this particular area set to increase in value by 2018 up to as much as 35% due to the proposed regeneration and improved transport links. Coupled with this, the HMO strategy ensures minimal void periods and high rental returns leaving a lot of room even in the unlikely event of a downturn in the market. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I appreciate not everyone can contribute an investment, however if you would like to contribute or help, I would appreciate you sharing this investment with anyone who may find it of interest or who could benefit from the high returns. Please feel free to share this investment with all your friends and family!</p>

<p>For the last several years we have been trying to source bearings for the Toyota SC12 and SC14 superchargers. I probably spent hundreds of hours trying to find someone at Toyota who cared enough to try to help us find a way to source bearings. Unfortunately dozens of people blew us off. I couldn't find one person who cared or could direct me to somoene who might be able to help. Finally I gave up on getting any help from Toyota but I continued looking into this and continued trying to find information. Finally I got bearing part numbers that would allow us to get bearings made by NSK. Unfortunately to get bearings made you need to get a lot made.<br/>We also need to get the recommended grease which is very expensive, along with some other tools and components to be able to rebuild these to OEM standards. We will also need to make some tooling and equipment to be able to replace the bearings properly.<br/>By the time everything is said and done I figure we would be about $15,000 into tooling up to be able to make these. Not only can we not afford to do this on our own we are also not willing to invest that much in something that will take 40 years to make our money back so we need to know the demand is there before we risk moving forward. If we can raise this $8000 it will make the investment cost tolerable and will be a sign it's worth our investment in time, money and energy.<br/><br/>We are estimating a complete base level rebuild including all seals and bearings inside the supercharger plus a pulley rebuild will be $800. We will have options on top of that such as fine particle shot peening and or ceramic coating the housings, pulleys and other components, porting and polishing, and things like that. There may be additional charges as well if components are broken or need replacing. There are some components we may be able to get new from Ogura but there may also be components that can't be sourced. In that case we may have them here or you may need to source another supercharger to mix and match to make the best possible SC. In our experience these issues are very rare though.<br/><br/>Anyone who donates anything can apply that money toward a supercharger rebuild in the future.<br/>Our base level rebuild will start at $800 so we will offer a special fundraising price of $600.<br/>This means if you donate $600 or more during this fundraiser you will qualify for a base level rebuild. If you pay anything over $600 that will count towards upgrades or other options such as porting, ceramic coatings and things like that.<br/>For our smaller donations we will try to do whatever we can as far as stickers or something like that. If however we break $9000 we will go a little further and send out some merch bags with some tee shirts and stickers or something like that.</p>
<p>If you have already had us service your supercharger we will give you $100 off if you don't want us to service the pulley bearing again.</p>
<p>The only catch is that we are doing this as an all or nothing campaign. We want some big donations that will go toward people getting their rebuilds and if we don't hit our mark that probably won't happen so we have to hit our goal for this to happen. If we don't, we might consider trying again in the future but don't count on it.<br/><br/>We got lucky and sourced a few of the gearbox side bearings which has allowed us to test our methods of pulling the old bearings out and installing the new bearings. We are now confident that we will be able to do this without any issues getting them back to factory specs.</p>
<p>It is also very likely this will allow us to rebuild other superchargers such as the TX12, TX15 and Tx20 such as is found on other Toyotas, Kawasaki PWC and many other machines.</p>

<p>It all started one morning in December 2015, when I was in Grade 8. I was looking at different online marketplaces to sell some items when a thought hit me, what would happen if someone made shopping social?</p>
<p>I pondered over it for a long time, coming up with ideas every now and then,  but it took some time before any real development actually happened to the idea. Every once in a while I drew up some concepts, but not much actually happened until one day in February 2016.</p>
<p>I was helping someone out with a small computer issue when a friend of mine for several years came up to me and said </p>
<p>        ""Woah! You are going to be the next Mark Zuckerberg!""</p>
<p>To this day I don't know what made him say that at that moment, but right then I just knew that I had to tell him about my idea.</p>
<p>We immediately started discussing the concept and sharing ideas for the site, and in a matter of minutes, we were a team working together on developing the idea.</p>
<p>After some time we had a solid idea of how the website was going to work and had done quite a bit of research on other online marketplaces. We were extremely surprised to find that no one else had created anything like it. As we began sharing the idea with other people we started to get more and more support and began to see more ways that the site could be helpful in life. </p>
<p>A couple months later, on a flight from Montreal to Quebec City, I started discussing HexZagon with another good friend of mine who was sitting in the seat next to me. For over an hour we talked to each other about the site. One thing led to another and within a week he had joined the project too and was officially a part of HexZagon.</p>
<p>Since then HexZagon has gone through many stages and has progressed so much further, but although we're no longer working together on the project, I've recently come to a point where we can't progress any further without the money required for web development, legal services, and more.</p>

</div><p>Certain Photos: Picjumbo.com</p><p>Music: Bensound.com</p></div>","Introducing HexZagon, the world's first combination of social media and online shopping. With HexZagon you can like the awesome new phone you just bought or tag the dress that you just know would be the perfect gift for your daughter's birthday. You can comment on the camera that has been on your wishlist for years or review the new laptop that your favorite company just announced. HexZagon even allows anyone, from big businesses to people just looking to get rid of a few used items, to sell their products on site so that you can find exactly what you're looking for, without having to leave the site. 

Just like any other form of social media, HexZagon allows users to ""like"" products so that you can give love to the products that matter the most to you.


Quickly sort products into categories like ""Christmas 2016"" or ""Wishlist"" so that they're there when you need them later. 


Have a discussion with other users about any product on the site. With commenting anyone can ask questions, tell other users about a product's cool features, or let people know that it's a product on their wishlist.


Reviewing makes it easier for you and other users to decide if they should buy something or not and can be vital in the decision-making process.


All products on the site are up for sale and offer safe and easy transactions with Stripe so that your hard earned money doesn't go to waste.


Anyone can sell their own products on the HexZagon website. Whether you're a big business or just looking to sell a few used items we've got you covered.


With gifting and chat, you can quickly tell anyone about awesome products you've seen on the site and send gifts right from your computer to other users. It's that easy.
 


HexZagon can help Promote your Products
Making shopping social means that people will share your products with other users, creating a virtually endless ripple effect and hundreds of customers for your business.
 

HexZagon makes Selling Anything Easier
With HexZagon you don't need to create your own website to sell products online. Just sign up for an account and add your products to the site. It's that easy. 
 

HexZagon makes Shopping more Entertaining
HexZagon helps users find more of the products that are actually interesting to them. The products that you see on your account are tailored to your interests, so you see more of the things that you actually like to buy.
 

HexZagon makes Shopping more Convenient
With HexZagon, you can buy products from all over the world without leaving the comfort of your home. Plus, HexZagon allows you to tag products making it possible to create shopping lists, wish lists, and more in just seconds. 

It all started one morning in December 2015, when I was in Grade 8. I was looking at different online marketplaces to sell some items when a thought hit me, what would happen if someone made shopping social?
I pondered over it for a long time, coming up with ideas every now and then,  but it took some time before any real development actually happened to the idea. Every once in a while I drew up some concepts, but not much actually happened until one day in February 2016.
I was helping someone out with a small computer issue when a friend of mine for several years came up to me and said 
        ""Woah! You are going to be the next Mark Zuckerberg!""
To this day I don't know what made him say that at that moment, but right then I just knew that I had to tell him about my idea.
We immediately started discussing the concept and sharing ideas for the site, and in a matter of minutes, we were a team working together on developing the idea.
After some time we had a solid idea of how the website was going to work and had done quite a bit of research on other online marketplaces. We were extremely surprised to find that no one else had created anything like it. As we began sharing the idea with other people we started to get more and more support and began to see more ways that the site could be helpful in life. 
A couple months later, on a flight from Montreal to Quebec City, I started discussing HexZagon with another good friend of mine who was sitting in the seat next to me. For over an hour we talked to each other about the site. One thing led to another and within a week he had joined the project too and was officially a part of HexZagon.
Since then HexZagon has gone through many stages and has progressed so much further, but although we're no longer working together on the project, I've recently come to a point where we can't progress any further without the money required for web development, legal services, and more.
​

 








Stretch goals are extra goals we set so that if we reach our $75,000 goal, we can fund additional aspects of the project like new features for the site.

years ago, I inherited my father's DSLR camera. It's almost like I'm seeing
through his eyes when I use it, and for that reason, it is very special.
My father’s father was a semi-pro and, back in the day, had rucksacks full of
lenses, puffy brushes, filters, and his own dark room. I’m hoping it’s a

My mind is animated when exploring the world in miniature and to be able to

notice the smaller things. And, as we know, 'small is beautiful'.<p></p>

</div>","Hello. I'm Katherine.


Seven
years ago, I inherited my father's DSLR camera. It's almost like I'm seeing
through his eyes when I use it, and for that reason, it is very special.
My father’s father was a semi-pro and, back in the day, had rucksacks full of
lenses, puffy brushes, filters, and his own dark room. I’m hoping it’s a
genetic thing and that one day I will be as good as they both were. 



I love
photography, macro photography in particular because I’m fascinated with detail.
My mind is animated when exploring the world in miniature and to be able to
zoom in and capture these moments for other eyes to appreciate is very
rewarding. In this fast paced world, it's often difficult to slow down and
notice the smaller things. And, as we know, 'small is beautiful'.



Apart from
dabbling in photography, I moonlight as an artist under my alter-ego, .katwolfe. I undertake small illustration and logo commissions, which I enjoy immensely; they give me a different kind of creative outlet outside of my professional role as a landscape architect.


Anyway, back
to the photography. 


The sad part about my story is that I feel like a bit of a fraud.
What I once thought was macro photography, is actually only 'macro'
photography. The lens my father spent a long time researching and saving for,
and that I inherited, is a multi-purpose, take it anywhere, shoot anything-type
zoom lens, with a 'macro' setting. It's a great lens and I've taken some great
photos with it, but it turns out my 'macro' photos, aren’t really macro at all. Technically, they’re only close-ups. 


So, just
like my dad, I have now spent a good while researching the new tools I need to
acquire in order to take actual macro photographs, develop my skills, and moonlight some more
(which means producing more lovely things that people can enjoy and perhaps buy). 


During this
process, I have learnt a lot about what has happened in the world of
photography in the last seven years. It appears, dad's camera has been
superseded by much bigger players, and, although I would like to go on using my dad's
'eyes' forever, if I want my macro photography to be as good as I'm imagining
it can be, I need to retire his beloved camera and find my own way. 


Looking at
the cost of an upgrade it seems that I need a wee bit of help. I've heard of
people doing marvellous things through crowd funding sites and found myself
thinking I should probably give it a go.  However, I don't believe it is right to just try and merely raise money from good people in order to purchase new, shiny tools; I want to use any help I can get to further myself and to create work people will enjoy. That's why this campaign is more important to me than just 'buying new stuff'; it's about nurturing .katwolfe.  
So, folks, here goes... no glossing over it, what I need is this:



a new camera body;

a proper macro lens;
a professional A3 photo printer; 
repro materials such as inks, photo-paper, cards, envelopes;
funds for larger scale / canvas printing (outsourced); and 
funds for postage and packing (to reward you all!).


I have considered what I am able to afford off my own back and would like to seek a further £2500 to make it all happen.  In return, and with huge thanks, I will send you limited edition perks! These will be prints or greetings cards of various sizes. There are even canvas prints up for grabs if you're feeling flash and generous. 
I have chosen to list my campaign as 'all or nothing' funding (a bit like myself), as it is important to me that any rewards I create are created as perfect as I can manage. A bit like a Michelin chef; if I cannot fulfill what's on the menu, I won't serve it.
I won't big up my project and say it's going to make a global impact or change your lives immeasurably, but it does mean the world to me.  
My biggest challenge in growing .katwolfe. is the juggling act I have to maintain between that and my professional employment i.e. time, and finding enough of it. I'm well rehearsed in burning that midnight oil (I'm an obsessive worker), but I also know when it's a good idea to zoom out. So, in light of that, I have given myself a lovely, long deadline to meet the challenge of producing beautiful work in reward for your generosity and faith.
Thank you so very much if you are able to help me, and even more so if you've managed to stay with me to the end of this! If you can't help me out with pennies please don't worry at all, but maybe you could share my plight in the hope that someone rich and famous hears it. And feels compelled to help.

<p>Everyone knows confetti, of course!</p>
<p>But… do you know what “confetti” means for Italians?</p>
<p>In Italy every time there’s something special to
celebrate, confetti are always the special guest and everybody eats at least
one confetto as a good omen.</p>
<p>Eat confetti???</p>
<p>Yes, because Italian confetti are delicious little
traditional sweets made with almonds or nuts coated with chocolate and covered
with a very thin layer of sugar.</p>
<p>They look like very small eggs filled with sweetness.</p>
<p>The story of the confetto starts a long time ago: it
is said that Ancient Romans used them to celebrate weddings and births;
centuries later, they were thrown out from the balconies of noble palaces
during Carnival time. And so this went on until these days.</p>
<p>Sweetaly wants to bring you these extraordinary Italian
“sugarplums” and ensures that your life becomes special everyday, a true daily
celebration.</p><p><br/></p>
<p><b><i><u>FIND THE RIGHT “CONFETTO”, MADE FOR YOU!</u></i></b></p>

<p>FOR TRADITIONALS: you have to try the Avola confetto,
the best Sicilian almond (renowned in the world) just covered by a tiny layer
of sugar to enhance the delicate fruit taste.</p>
<p>FOR REAL FOODIES: 
you have to try one of the incredible flavors, going from the less
strange (such as strawberry, orange or coconut) to the most unusual ones (such
as tiramisù, marron glacée, champagne or baba with cream). <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">More than 50 flavors are waiting for you.</span></p>
<p>IF YOU DON’T FANCY ALMONDS: we do have the right confetto
for you too. Instead of an almond, the heart of this small sweet can be a nut,
a marshmallow, a wafer, a caramelized popcorn or a piece of dehydrated fruit!</p>
<p>FOR HEALTH LOVERS: we have the “Wellness line” in
which you can find dairy free, vegan, organic, sugar free confetto.</p>

Italy, a career that drove me to discovering confetti and their “taste
evolution” through the years. There were no weddings without a big and special
“confetti table”, that was assaulted every time by the guests: in a few minutes
cups and bowles were found empty! </p>
<p>So I became a friend of one of the most important
confetti factories in Italy, a company founded at the end of IX century.</p>
<p>They are my exclusive partners and suppliers for
confetti in this project.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.confettimaxtris.it/en"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Maxtris”</a> are really the very best confetti in the world!</p>
<p>Day after day my project became more and more
ambitious:  why don’t add Italian
chocolate too?</p>
<p>Even when choosing my chocolate supplier I relied on
my “friendships” so I contacted <a href=""http://www.lamolina.it/en/catalogo.aspx"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“La Molina”</a>: high quality raw materials, skillful
manufacturing and vintage packages are the strong points of this company.</p>
<p>The name comes from “molinillo”, the tool used to
prepare hot chocolate by the private chocolate maker of Marie Therese, wife of the
Sun King of France.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""></p><p>                                          <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1164253/files/20150121044817-molinillo-mini-jpg.jpg?1421844497"" src="""" style=""width: 246.428571428571px; height: 115px;""/></p><p><b><i><u><br/></u></i></b></p><p><b><i><u>WHY WE NEED YOUR HELP!</u></i></b></p>
<p>
</p><p><b>As you saw in the
video New Yorkers tasted our products, and they liked them!</b></p>
<p>Often they
asked us where they could find our Italian confetti in the City…but at the
moment they can’t!</p>
<p>That’s why we
are asking you a help to open the Sweetaly store in New York.</p>
<p><i>We’ve seen a cute
and beautiful place in Soho that would be perfect for the shop</i>.</p>
<p>We plan to recreate
the typical atmosphere of an Italian small deli store: welcoming, colorful and
friendly; scented of chocolate and sugar. But at the same time we want it young,
smart and very “New Yorker”.</p>
<p>The shop will
virtually be divided in two parts: confetti and chocolates.</p>
<p>We have a lot
of ideas about the “confetti&amp;chocolate project”: store layout, customized
packages, and special services for customers, both private and business.</p>
<p><i><u>What about CONFETTI</u></i>: while in Italy every small town
has its confetti shop, in New York there’s nothing of the sort. Italian
confetti must find their “house” in the City, as at the moment they can’t be found
in any other store, and we want to have the possibility of creating it! </p>
<p>New York and
New Yorkers miss not having a confetti shop.</p>
<p>Our supplier
is very research and development oriented, so periodically the product list will
be enhanced… stay tuned!</p>
<p>And, last but
not least, our confetti have a “Siks” kosher certification!</p>
<p><i><u>What about CHOCOLATE</u></i>: also our chocolate supplier is
always searching for something new to present, and sometimes adds new and interesting
ingredients to enhance the flavor of the chocolate. And the courage wins! </p>
<p>In our shop it
will be possible for you to taste chocolate with rosemary, sage, balsamic
vinegar or “salty” chocolate.</p>
<p>The marketing
manager is a true artist and painter, so the packages will be a perfect mix of
art and commercial features: as said previously also the presentation is
important.</p>
<p>There will
also be a chocolate bar corner where everyone will be able to find the perfect
“chocolate cup” choosing it between some daily flavors (mint, cinnamon, etc…);
in winter time you will warm yourself with a hot chocolate, in summer time refresh
yourself with a cold one.</p>
<p>We know that in
New York there are lots of sweets and chocolate shops but our store has some
specific strong points:</p>
<p></p><ul>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">You will find Italian confetti only in our store</span><br/>

Furthermore all our products are gluten free (except
wafer, cereals and cookies confetto)
DO YOU CRAVE FOR MORE?
To integrate Sweetaly’s offer we also decide to offer
you the highest quality Italian chocolates from Tuscany, a country that has a very
old chocolate tradition even if some other places are more famous, such as Piemonte
or Umbria.
Different lines and tastes to satisfy discerning
palates: from chocolate creams to pralines, from chocolate cakes to little
squared chocolate candies, perfect for an “Italian after coffee”.                                                
Beautiful vintage packages wrap these delicious products,
because also presentation is important.                     
WHO WE ARE:
I’m Silvia and I used to be a wedding planner in
Italy, a career that drove me to discovering confetti and their “taste
evolution” through the years. There were no weddings without a big and special
“confetti table”, that was assaulted every time by the guests: in a few minutes
cups and bowles were found empty! 
So I became a friend of one of the most important
confetti factories in Italy, a company founded at the end of IX century.
They are my exclusive partners and suppliers for
confetti in this project.
“Maxtris” are really the very best confetti in the world!
Day after day my project became more and more
ambitious:  why don’t add Italian
chocolate too?
Even when choosing my chocolate supplier I relied on
my “friendships” so I contacted “La Molina”: high quality raw materials, skillful
manufacturing and vintage packages are the strong points of this company.
The name comes from “molinillo”, the tool used to
prepare hot chocolate by the private chocolate maker of Marie Therese, wife of the
Sun King of France.                                          WHY WE NEED YOUR HELP!

As you saw in the
video New Yorkers tasted our products, and they liked them!
Often they
asked us where they could find our Italian confetti in the City…but at the
moment they can’t!
That’s why we
are asking you a help to open the Sweetaly store in New York.
We’ve seen a cute
and beautiful place in Soho that would be perfect for the shop.
We plan to recreate
the typical atmosphere of an Italian small deli store: welcoming, colorful and
friendly; scented of chocolate and sugar. But at the same time we want it young,
smart and very “New Yorker”.
The shop will
virtually be divided in two parts: confetti and chocolates.
We have a lot
of ideas about the “confetti&chocolate project”: store layout, customized
packages, and special services for customers, both private and business.
What about CONFETTI: while in Italy every small town
has its confetti shop, in New York there’s nothing of the sort. Italian
confetti must find their “house” in the City, as at the moment they can’t be found
in any other store, and we want to have the possibility of creating it! 
New York and
New Yorkers miss not having a confetti shop.
Our supplier
is very research and development oriented, so periodically the product list will
be enhanced… stay tuned!
And, last but
not least, our confetti have a “Siks” kosher certification!
What about CHOCOLATE: also our chocolate supplier is
always searching for something new to present, and sometimes adds new and interesting
ingredients to enhance the flavor of the chocolate. And the courage wins! 
In our shop it
will be possible for you to taste chocolate with rosemary, sage, balsamic
vinegar or “salty” chocolate.
The marketing
manager is a true artist and painter, so the packages will be a perfect mix of
art and commercial features: as said previously also the presentation is
important.
There will
also be a chocolate bar corner where everyone will be able to find the perfect
“chocolate cup” choosing it between some daily flavors (mint, cinnamon, etc…);
in winter time you will warm yourself with a hot chocolate, in summer time refresh
yourself with a cold one.
We know that in
New York there are lots of sweets and chocolate shops but our store has some
specific strong points:


You will find Italian confetti only in our store


We will sell handmade products, and with new interesting tastes


We will give you the highest service possible.
For example: in summertime and when it’s too hot we will put your box of
chocolates and confetti in a bag with thermal insulation to preserve the
product; you will be able to customize your confetti box with your favorite
flavors; etc…


We think our store will be different from every other sweet store,SO BELIEVE IN US AND WILL MAKE YOU PROUD OF US!Help us to serve you our sweet Italian experience!
Directly in the New York store or easily at home
thanks to our e-commerce.
We bet that once you eat a confetto you’ll never stop
because one confetto leads to another!Let us make your daily life
special, celebrate life with us!Spread the word! SPREAD THE ""SWEETNESS""!",8.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Hi folks, I am Engineer Geofrey Mukasa, CEO/Director of NETBAC AGENCY LTD and CEO of OSOMS a subsidiary of NETBAC AGENCY LTD, I am a petroleum engineer by profession and an entrepreneur by nature.</p>
<p>My campaign of FOOD VALUE ADDITION idea was born from the harsh fact that Uganda and most African Countries are the one of the leading producers of organic foods in the World but unfortunately 2/3rds of the total food produced in Uganda and other African countries go to waste due to lack of value addition and modern preservation methods to save all the produced foods.</p>
<p><strong>This campaign is very important to me because of various reasons;</strong></p>
<p>1.  This will help to increase food security in Uganda, Africa and the World at large, as it has been said that without food people are only left with three options; They can riot, They can migrate or worst they can die, and no one can whish that onto themselves, see the current situation in Malawi and other countries are facing this fatal problem and yet we can do something about it.</p>
<p>2. This will not only save people’s lives by providing reliable nutritious organic foods in Uganda, Africa and the World over, it will also create jobs and careers to thousands and thousands of professionals from all over the world.</p>
<p>3. And most importantly by promoting Food Value Addition, we can all make the World a better home for all of us, as one legend said ‘’ Stay hungry stay foolish’’, and with this campaign we can all fight hidden hunger in the World at large, please contribute to this noble cause, you never know how many people you can truly touch and make a brighter day for them and how much it can help you yourself.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT YOU WILL HELP ME ACHIEVE?</strong></p>
<p>Firstly and most importantly you will help me achieve my dream of making the world a better place for all of us, by at least providing food security to the most unpreveraged citizens of the world, We can only be able to achieve this together only through improving food value addition and preservation methods so that all the produced foods can have a longer shelf life and they can easily be procured to the people who might be needing it the most before it get wasted, as you know 2/3rds of African total produced foods got wasted annually due to lack of food value addition and modern preservation methods, too sad right? So please help me translate this idea into reality and we reverse this situation together, Thanks!!</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>We need $3,382,352 USD, and on this money we will buy enough land around a square mile estimated at around $588,235 USD (2 Billion Ugandan Shillings), we will also have to construct enough facilities to handle the sorting, processing, packaging and storage of foods and fruits which are estimated at around  $1,500,000 USD (5.1 Billion Ugandan Shillings), we will create a Research and Development facility (R&amp;D) which will focus on coming up with new advanced technologies for Food Value Addition and preservation methods, with the main mission of maintain the natural composition of the preserved foods as natural as possible, this R&amp;D facility will command an estimate of $294,117 USD (1 Billion Ugandan Shillings), we will also need procurement of production lines in the sorting, processing, packaging and storage facilities to enable easy and optimized handling of the Value Addition process these are estimated at around $1,000,000 USD (3.4 Billion Ugandan Shillings), Because we are already legally existing with Certificate of Incorporation  number 174115 &amp; TIN. 1006855530. We are competent to make this mission come true of course with your support and contribution to this noble cause.</p>
<p><strong>What you will get?</strong></p>
<p>Please check my various 7 perks I have arranged for you my valued supporter and contributor and please help me to spread the word by sharing this campaign to your friends, family and the world at large, Thanks a lot.</p>
<p>If I do not reach my entire goal of $3,382,352 USD I will use the raised funds to start on the project and see where they can reach me and certainly I will fundraise again for the remaining sectors in order to accomplish the whole mission as planned, but I have faith in you that together we can raise this amount with ease in this one campaign.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact of this Campaign </strong></p>
<p>This project I truly think and believe that it is very valuable not only to Uganda where it is going to be based but also to the whole of Africa and the World at large! Trust me we all need good and nutritious foods and fruits no matter who you are or where you are located, food is a basic need and the only fuel for life and without it death will surly preside over. This project is meant to ensure food security in Uganda, Africa and the world at large, as you heard from the Ambassador, Uganda can be a food basket of the whole world, if only supported by you and me, because we are the world and we are the true children of the land, so let us start giving and make the world a better home for all of us. Please check the video above.</p>
<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
<p>Well the earth was not created in one day! It took GOD six days to create it, right!, So I expect a few challenges like procurement of equipment and the whole process of setting up the project, but those are just challenges of growth that will only make us better if not greater, and of course with your help by contributing both monetary and ideally this project will surely be a walkover. And yes together we can!</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help </strong></p>
<p>Please due to the importance of this campaign, I kindly request you to please, if you can`t contribute monetary or ideally, atleast get the word out and make some noise about this campaign #FOODVALUEADDITION and it is notably to do both if it pleases you.

<p>      You can tell from its skyline alone that Denver is a major metropolis, with a Major League Baseball stadium at one end of downtown and the State Capitol building at the other. But look to the west to see where Denver distinguishes itself in the majestic Rocky Mountains, snow-peaked and breathtakingly huge, looming in the distance. This combination of urban sprawl and proximity to nature is what gives the city character and sets it apart as a destination.                             Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, when the city mushroomed on a huge surge of oil and energy revenues, Denver worked on the transition from Old West ""cow town"" to a comfortable, modern place to live. The city demolished its large downtown Skid Row area, paving the way for developments such as the Tabor Center and the Auraria multicollege campus. In the early 1990s mayors Federico Peña and Wellington Webb championed a massive new airport to replace the rickety Stapleton. Then the city lured Major League Baseball, in the form of the purple-and-black Colorado Rockies, and built Coors Field in the heart of downtown. Around the stadium, planners developed LoDo, a business-and-shop ping area including hip nightclubs, Larimer Square boutiques, and bike and walking paths.                                                                                      Since the mid-1990s Denver has caught the attention of several major national corporations looking to move their operations to a thriving city that enjoys a relatively stable economy and a healthy business climate. And win or lose, the sports teams continue to imbue the city with a sense of pride.                                                                                                                                                                       Many Denverites are unabashed nature lovers who can also enjoy the outdoors within the city limits by walking along the park-lined river paths downtown. (Perhaps as a result of their active lifestyle, Denverites are among the ""thinnest"" city residents in the United States, and the city is named annually as one of the healthiest in the nation.) For Denverites, preserving the environment and the city's rich mining and ranching heritage are of equally vital importance to the quality of life.                                                                                                                                                                  LoDo, a business-and-shopping area, buzzes with jazz clubs, restaurants, and art galleries housed in carefully restored century-old buildings. The culturally diverse populace avidly supports the Denver Art Museum, the Denver Museum of Nature &amp; Science, the Museo de las Americas, and the new History Colorado Center (formerly the Colorado History Museum). The Denver Performing Arts Complex is the nation's second-largest theatrical venue, bested in capacity only by New York's Lincoln Center. An excellent public transportation system, including a popular, growing light-rail system and 850 miles of bike paths, makes getting around easy.</p>

Our Home - Denver, Colorado

      The Mile High City — is where urban sophistication meets outdoor adventure. Denver is an outdoor city known for its world-class cultural attractions, thriving craft breweries, chef-driven dining and red-hot music scene, all within easy reach of the Rocky Mountains. Whether you’re looking to ski the world-famous Rocky Mountains, explore the many cities and towns or enjoy breathtaking natural beauty, you’ll find your perfect adventure in Colorado. The state’s four distinct seasons, 300 days of annual sunshine and great vacation values make this the perfect time to plan a trip.

      You can tell from its skyline alone that Denver is a major metropolis, with a Major League Baseball stadium at one end of downtown and the State Capitol building at the other. But look to the west to see where Denver distinguishes itself in the majestic Rocky Mountains, snow-peaked and breathtakingly huge, looming in the distance. This combination of urban sprawl and proximity to nature is what gives the city character and sets it apart as a destination.                             Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, when the city mushroomed on a huge surge of oil and energy revenues, Denver worked on the transition from Old West ""cow town"" to a comfortable, modern place to live. The city demolished its large downtown Skid Row area, paving the way for developments such as the Tabor Center and the Auraria multicollege campus. In the early 1990s mayors Federico Peña and Wellington Webb championed a massive new airport to replace the rickety Stapleton. Then the city lured Major League Baseball, in the form of the purple-and-black Colorado Rockies, and built Coors Field in the heart of downtown. Around the stadium, planners developed LoDo, a business-and-shop ping area including hip nightclubs, Larimer Square boutiques, and bike and walking paths.                                                                                      Since the mid-1990s Denver has caught the attention of several major national corporations looking to move their operations to a thriving city that enjoys a relatively stable economy and a healthy business climate. And win or lose, the sports teams continue to imbue the city with a sense of pride.                                                                                                                                                                       Many Denverites are unabashed nature lovers who can also enjoy the outdoors within the city limits by walking along the park-lined river paths downtown. (Perhaps as a result of their active lifestyle, Denverites are among the ""thinnest"" city residents in the United States, and the city is named annually as one of the healthiest in the nation.) For Denverites, preserving the environment and the city's rich mining and ranching heritage are of equally vital importance to the quality of life.                                                                                                                                                                  LoDo, a business-and-shopping area, buzzes with jazz clubs, restaurants, and art galleries housed in carefully restored century-old buildings. The culturally diverse populace avidly supports the Denver Art Museum, the Denver Museum of Nature & Science, the Museo de las Americas, and the new History Colorado Center (formerly the Colorado History Museum). The Denver Performing Arts Complex is the nation's second-largest theatrical venue, bested in capacity only by New York's Lincoln Center. An excellent public transportation system, including a popular, growing light-rail system and 850 miles of bike paths, makes getting around easy.

<p>Youth
unemployment is currently a major challenge in South Africa. A quarter of the population is unemployed
and this rises to over 35% amongst people under 35 years of age. South African
youth can no longer wait for the government to provide easy employment options
in the public sector. Also, formal business is not growing fast enough to
create enough jobs. </p>
<p>For many young South African’s, it is very difficult to gain
access to sustainable business opportunities. Socio-economic inequality is prevalent
with the gap between the rich and poor is one of the highest in the world even
21 years after the end of apartheid. While many people have skills and talent, they
all too often they lack the capital and access to credit to purchase vehicles
and equipment they need to start their own small business. Also, there are
simply insufficient mechanisms to adequately support tradespeople and artisans
wanting to work for themselves. While the problems are complex we have found an
innovative solution making it possible for this group. </p>
<p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>The solution</b></p>
<p><b>Oncall’s</b><span> mission</span> is to offer a safe, nurturing and supportive environment for
budding entrepreneurs while providing a reliable service. Customers are assured
of good quality not only because all artisans and tradespeople are properly
qualified, trained and vetted, but also because there is an inbuilt rating
system that ensures accountability. Our platform builds an extensive network of
resources designed to build successful business. These resources include access
to large markets, technical and soft skills

<p><b>OnCall’s </b>aims to break down business

<br/>Alle reden von Umwelt und Klimaschutz. Wir hatten uns gedacht, wir MACHEN mal! Zumal wir unseren direkten Mitbewerber mehr im Auto als im Fahrrad sehen. Wusstet ihr, daß der deutsche Autofahrer bei einer täglichen 30-Minuten-Anfahrt  ins Großstadtbüro durchschnittlich circa 80 Stunden im Jahr im Pendlerstau steht? Viele unserer Bestandskunden tun dies mit einem unserer schnellen Pedelecs nicht mehr – sie kommen pünktlich an. Vielleicht schaffen wir auch in deutschen Klein- wie Großstädten ein zweites, drittes ... ""Kopenhagen"" zu schaffen. Bewegung schafft ein eBike allemal, ganz zu schweigen von der nachhaltigen mobilen Freiheit.<ul>
</ul>Da wir nun schon seit drei Jahren gewissermaßen als Baby unter Menschenfressern überlebt und aus begangenen Fehlern auch gelernt haben, sehen wir der Zukunft sehr positiv und überzeugt entgegen. Um diese Überzeugung zu festigen, hatten wir uns in den letzten Wochen vor der Entscheidung professionelle bzw. neutrale Unterstützung durch eine Unternehmensberatung ins Haus geholt.<ul>

<br/>Wir denken unkonventionell, sind dennoch bodenständig und versuchen immer den Horizont im Auge zu behalten. Wachstum heißt für uns nicht, die Masse zu bedienen. Im Haifschbecken Fahrrad kann nur überleben, wer sich spezialisiert. Gleichwohl streben wir ein gesundes Wachstum an. Lange haben wir uns die Köpfe darüber zerbrochen, ob wir uns weiterhin dieser Herausforderung stellen wollen.

<br/>Im Zuge unserer Überlegungen haben wir beschlossen, den Schwerpunkt bei der eBike-/Pedelec-Entwicklung auf den Bau von Getriebefahrrädern weiter zu intensivieren. Getreu unserer Vorstellung von einem höchstmöglich wartungsarmen, frei zu konfigurierendem eBike werden wir unsere Modellpalette daher konsolidieren. Das heisst konkret: Wir richten die flitzbike-Modellpalette allein auf Getriebefahrräder aus, Mittelmotormodelle werden reduziert bzw. eingestellt.  Mittelmotor-eBikes fallen unter den Punkt ""Masse"". Diese können und wollen wir nicht mehr bedienen.  <br/><br/>Ergänzend zu unseren Produkten führen wir momentan einen Kundenservice auf einem derart qualitativ hohem Niveau ein, wie es in der Automobilbranche üblich ist. Der Dienst am Kunden scheint unserer Ansicht nach im Bereich Fahrrad nicht vorhanden. Dem einen oder anderen Kunden haben wir manche Service-Stichworte bereits angedeutet und sie kommen an: ""Mobiler Radservice"", ""Testradservice"", ""Workshops"", ""Fahrtechnik-Kurse"" usw. – All dies gehört zum Fahrrad- bzw. eBikekauf dazu. Bedienen tuts keiner, vermisst wirds von vielen!<br/>

Unsere Benefits liegen im Thema Fahrrad und Pedelecs/E-Bikes. Vom Schrauberkurs bis zum hochwertigen eBike. Mehr findet Ihr bei den Perks.

 Da wir die Kapitalbeschaffung nicht eingleisig fahren, wird das gesammelte Geld auf jeden Fall zum Weiterführen der Firma verwendet. Kann dies nicht umgesetzt werden, bekommt jeder sein Geld zurück!
    Sinnvolles Tun
  

Alle reden von Umwelt und Klimaschutz. Wir hatten uns gedacht, wir MACHEN mal! Zumal wir unseren direkten Mitbewerber mehr im Auto als im Fahrrad sehen. Wusstet ihr, daß der deutsche Autofahrer bei einer täglichen 30-Minuten-Anfahrt  ins Großstadtbüro durchschnittlich circa 80 Stunden im Jahr im Pendlerstau steht? Viele unserer Bestandskunden tun dies mit einem unserer schnellen Pedelecs nicht mehr – sie kommen pünktlich an. Vielleicht schaffen wir auch in deutschen Klein- wie Großstädten ein zweites, drittes ... ""Kopenhagen"" zu schaffen. Bewegung schafft ein eBike allemal, ganz zu schweigen von der nachhaltigen mobilen Freiheit.
Da wir nun schon seit drei Jahren gewissermaßen als Baby unter Menschenfressern überlebt und aus begangenen Fehlern auch gelernt haben, sehen wir der Zukunft sehr positiv und überzeugt entgegen. Um diese Überzeugung zu festigen, hatten wir uns in den letzten Wochen vor der Entscheidung professionelle bzw. neutrale Unterstützung durch eine Unternehmensberatung ins Haus geholt.

   Die kommenden Herausforderungen für flitzbike
    

Wir denken unkonventionell, sind dennoch bodenständig und versuchen immer den Horizont im Auge zu behalten. Wachstum heißt für uns nicht, die Masse zu bedienen. Im Haifschbecken Fahrrad kann nur überleben, wer sich spezialisiert. Gleichwohl streben wir ein gesundes Wachstum an. Lange haben wir uns die Köpfe darüber zerbrochen, ob wir uns weiterhin dieser Herausforderung stellen wollen. Unsere Antwort ist – aufgrund unserer Erfahrungen und positiven Entwicklung der letzten drei Jahre – ein ganz klares: Ja!



Im Zuge unserer Überlegungen haben wir beschlossen, den Schwerpunkt bei der eBike-/Pedelec-Entwicklung auf den Bau von Getriebefahrrädern weiter zu intensivieren. Getreu unserer Vorstellung von einem höchstmöglich wartungsarmen, frei zu konfigurierendem eBike werden wir unsere Modellpalette daher konsolidieren. Das heisst konkret: Wir richten die flitzbike-Modellpalette allein auf Getriebefahrräder aus, Mittelmotormodelle werden reduziert bzw. eingestellt.  Mittelmotor-eBikes fallen unter den Punkt ""Masse"". Diese können und wollen wir nicht mehr bedienen.  Ergänzend zu unseren Produkten führen wir momentan einen Kundenservice auf einem derart qualitativ hohem Niveau ein, wie es in der Automobilbranche üblich ist. Der Dienst am Kunden scheint unserer Ansicht nach im Bereich Fahrrad nicht vorhanden. Dem einen oder anderen Kunden haben wir manche Service-Stichworte bereits angedeutet und sie kommen an: ""Mobiler Radservice"", ""Testradservice"", ""Workshops"", ""Fahrtechnik-Kurse"" usw. – All dies gehört zum Fahrrad- bzw. eBikekauf dazu. Bedienen tuts keiner, vermisst wirds von vielen!
    

Vielen Dank fürs Weitersagen!
  Es heißt so schön: Das wahre Kapital einer Unternehmung sind Kontakte. Wir danken allen, die bereit sind, unser Vorhaben weiterzugeben. Nur so können wir unseren Traum in die Tat umsetzen und unserer Verantwortung gegenüber unseren Kunden wie Interessenten gerecht werden.

<p>
</p>
<ul><li>
<strong>Robust slicer to generate G-code</strong> - own parallelized slicer, written in C++, for a comprehensive solution to thin parts and supports.

This will be mainly dedicated to bug fixes, technical support for the community, e.g. when compiling 3DimMaker from source on different platforms and/or compilers, and basic support for DLP (Digital Light Processing) printers using photopolymers.The more we raise, the more impetus we receive to push 3DimMaker forward. So any spare funds will be used in the ongoing development of new features, which will be determined by the requirements and suggestions from the community.With the collected funds we will invest in 3DimMaker and at the same time create jobs within the community.

Hey, have you really kept on reading down to here! You're probably already a fan. So, if you like 3DimMaker and want to have it open source:
please CONTRIBUTE,


FORWARD link to this campaign (http://igg.me/at/3dimmaker/x/12489930) to your friends and colleagues and help us reach our goals,
and DEFINE THE FUTURE directions in which 3DimMaker will develop.

Thank you!FAQsQ: In the perks it seems like you won't get access to the source unless you pay at least 90 euros. This part is a bit misleading...Of course, 3DimMaker will become OSS being available for everyone!Q: There's no mention of a linux version. Given that it uses libraries that are available on linux already. Is there anything else that would make a linux port hard to do? I just want to know how feasible this would be.To our knowledge, there is no part being a barrier when porting 3DimMaker to linux. For sure there will be some minor fixes required - linking of libraries, small code fixes arising from a different compiler, etc. But we alredy have the Mac port so we belive the linux one won't be difficult to prepare...Q: The graphs are extremely confusing. I can't figure out if you're saying that 3DimMaker is taking more or less time to slice than the other slicers on the Stretchlet test.When slicing the Stretchlet model, all the slicers were equally very very fast but there were many issues with the generated g-code. Please see the above figures illustrating the difference between g-codes from 3DimMaker, Cura and KiSSlicer.   Q: Actually, this stuff is not ""open source in near future"" but ""maybe open source IF got enough monies"". Going open source is a stretch goal.3DimMaker will become open source immediately after M1, but without the thin parts which are dependend on STALGO. Once STALGO is replaced, the functionality of thin parts will be available as well. All the stretch goals are just an offer from our side. They mean we can further provide improved support to the community and ongoing development...",12.0,1,"1 Campaign

<p>We're two young men with the same last name, born in Appalachia and have a passion for our planet!  We've spent our twenties working retail jobs, farming, starting businesses, traveling, making music, making babies, and of course exploring the outdoors!  All of those things have led us to wanting to work together to bring fill a gap in our community and now we need your help!</p>
<p><strong>What we’re doing</strong></p>
<p>We are asking for funds to open up a location that provides gently used outdoor gear and facilitates community events, workshops, and programs all focused on empowering yourself to get the most out of your time outdoors!  The outdoor gear consignment model is something that has been successful and continues to be in several cities.  We want to offer that as well as enriching outdoor workshops and opportunities to make your community a better place through involvement and service!  We're not reinventing the wheel here! We just want to add this wheel to our Appalachian Community!</p>
<p><b>Why it’s important </b></p>
<p>The opening of this marketplace will allow the community to support a circular economy keeps resources in use for as long as possible and extracts maximum value from the item. Also nurturing the love for the outdoors in our youth is extremely important to us.  We're both fathers and want to pass down skills and principles to kids as well as adults that will help to preserve and utilize our planet.  We believe that every community with outdoor enthusiasts should have local access to that! Especially Berea, Kentucky!</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The risks to opening any brick and mortar location are plentiful.  In the beginning we will be taking risks on acquiring the initial inventory as we will be relying largely on a working partnership with the community.  Advertising is crucial in the first months and if we are not able to fund it properly we will have to have word of mouth support.  Big box retailers and online giants want to cut out the little guy, so we will struggle to compete with their prices and exposure as these are common items. But this stuff is supposed to be challenging right? We want to take on that challenge!</p>
<p>- We both together have over 20 years of experience in retail and sales.<br/>- Over the years we have made many wonderful relationships that bridge the gap to help with low overhead advertising.<br/>- We pride ourselves in our creativity and ability to make something out of nothing.<br/>- Our location is next to a high traffic fitness center and en route to many outdoor areas (Lake Cumberland, The Pinnacles, Anglin Falls, Holly Bay, RRG, and many more) which we believe will help with word of mouth advertising in the community.  Which is essential to a thriving brick and mortar business in Kentucky.<br/>- As small business owners we know that capital cash flow is the key to getting any business off the ground. We already have several partnerships that will allow us to have stock on consignment while building a local consignment inventory, allowing us to open immediately. With low overhead and effective product selection this will be an outdoorsmans dream.<br/>- Taking advantage of our high traffic retail location <br/>- Using online marketplace/social media relations to find and sale new products and customers.<br/> </p>

</p><p>Dear
Friends,</p>
<p>My
name is Mr. Lim and from Singapore, Asia. Two years ago, the company I worked
for went into closure. And for the past two years, it has been a continuous
struggle to find job as the employment market has been badly affected by the
bad economy. At the same time I have to take care of two young children. I am
blessed that I have a close family and friends who help to lift my spirit up.</p>
<p>However,
I have to be realistic as well as bills are piling up and basic necessities
need to be fulfilled. I tried to find out a business that allows me to have
flexibility in taking care of my young children who needs my constant
attention. And for that reason, I am trying my chance to setup a website that
focuses on Asian travel, culinary and lifestyle.</p>
<p>The
purpose of this website is to allow financial flexibility at the same time to
help out other struggling writers, designers and other people who would like to
earn something by helping our website grow.</p>
<p>I am
currently setting up the system so that every interested young writer can get
an incentive to post their writing online, economic sharing for designer who
provide their design for our to-be-online shop, as well as other normal people
who would like to post an interesting article/art/others in our site.</p>
<p>I
really wish that the site will be a place where everyone can share thoughts and
kindness. A site where our American &amp; European friend to get to know more
about Asia and its people. A site where there is no
hate/crime/racism/violence/pornography - I will ban this kind of content and
the site is also not meant for gossips.</p>
<p>The
website will be done in 2 basic languages, Asian and English. At the same time
its installed with language software so our readers can read in their own
language.</p>
<p>The
funds will be used for company setup, IT personnel, writers, designers, and
more. And we aim as we grow, we can utilise the site more to do more good
things. </p>
<p>I
hope you can be part of this and help. Thank you so much in advance.</p>
<p>Should
you be interested to join the business or help to make it grow or simply to

Friends,
My
name is Mr. Lim and from Singapore, Asia. Two years ago, the company I worked
for went into closure. And for the past two years, it has been a continuous
struggle to find job as the employment market has been badly affected by the
bad economy. At the same time I have to take care of two young children. I am
blessed that I have a close family and friends who help to lift my spirit up.
However,
I have to be realistic as well as bills are piling up and basic necessities
need to be fulfilled. I tried to find out a business that allows me to have
flexibility in taking care of my young children who needs my constant
attention. And for that reason, I am trying my chance to setup a website that
focuses on Asian travel, culinary and lifestyle.
The
purpose of this website is to allow financial flexibility at the same time to
help out other struggling writers, designers and other people who would like to
earn something by helping our website grow.
I am
currently setting up the system so that every interested young writer can get
an incentive to post their writing online, economic sharing for designer who
provide their design for our to-be-online shop, as well as other normal people
who would like to post an interesting article/art/others in our site.
I
really wish that the site will be a place where everyone can share thoughts and
kindness. A site where our American & European friend to get to know more
about Asia and its people. A site where there is no
hate/crime/racism/violence/pornography - I will ban this kind of content and
the site is also not meant for gossips.
The
website will be done in 2 basic languages, Asian and English. At the same time
its installed with language software so our readers can read in their own
language.
The
funds will be used for company setup, IT personnel, writers, designers, and
more. And we aim as we grow, we can utilise the site more to do more good
things. 
I
hope you can be part of this and help. Thank you so much in advance.
Should
you be interested to join the business or help to make it grow or simply to
know more about the business, can contact me at my business email -

<h2>Wee Summary</h2>
<p><strong>This campaign is meant to aid the start-up of a miniature surfboard company that we are starting (Matthew &amp; Nicole) called WeeBoards.com that
  hopes to bring back the meaning of fun to the sport of surfing.</strong> Today with crowded beaches and the ultra-competitive nature of the sport, surfers
  everywhere are forgetting how to just have fun. At WeeBoards, with our less serious attitude and thru our fun, snack-sized, highly customizable surfboards, we hope to change this.</p>
<p>Hello from Matthew and Nicole, the founders of WeeBOARDS.com, a surfboard manufacturer and online retailer based out of Seattle, WA. At WeeBoards.com customers can customize and purchase mini surfboards online while helping us to donate used surfboards to Nicaraguan kids (Groms) living in poverty.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444056217/hceslzcn4075iqpna7bz.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left; padding: 0 8px 8px 0;""/> Matthew is a Web and Graphic Designer with Online Marketing Experience of
  over 18 Years. He grew up surfing the Santa Barbara, Ventura County area in
  Southern California and has been in and out of the Action sports industry a
  good portion of his life.</p>

Like Matthew, Nicole grew up surfing the Santa Barbara, Ventura County area in Southern California and has always had love and respect for the ocean.</p>
<p><strong>WAVES FOR NICAS, A Greater Purpose:</strong> WeeBoards.com is not just about making money selling highly customizable mini surfboards, as much fun as that is. :) 
  We have a bigger mission in sight and that's simply to share the feeling of STOKED
  that only surfing provides with the less fortunate, world-wide. WeeBoards.com
  helps do this through our side project called ""WAVES FOR NICAS"", which takes
  money from every sale and purchases used-surfboards and donates the boards to Nicaraguan kids living in poverty. It's a simple project without all of
  the red-tape that other organizations have as we strictly stick to the K.I.S.S. methodology, Keep It Simply SURFING. We use money donated and
  a percentage from every sale we make online and off, to buy used surfboards from local travelers that are looking to ditch the excess baggage on the flight home, and give the boards directly to local groms (kids) who couldn't otherwise afford to own a surfboard. We are going to document each and every giveaway on our website on a consistent monthly basis so that everyone will be able to share in the rewards of giving. And while the sport of surfing is growing by leaps
  and bounds in Nicaragua, through the ""Waves for Nicas"" project there will be more
  opportunities for these kids to get sponsored and compete in competitions internationally. We
  also want to utilize our connection with Nicaragua's premier surfing
  association ASSUR, who will be beneficial with connecting our donated boards
  with the kids that need them the most.</p>

<a href=""mailto:info@weeboards.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">info@weeboards.com</a></strong></div>","Wee Summary
This campaign is meant to aid the start-up of a miniature surfboard company that we are starting (Matthew & Nicole) called WeeBoards.com that
  hopes to bring back the meaning of fun to the sport of surfing. Today with crowded beaches and the ultra-competitive nature of the sport, surfers
  everywhere are forgetting how to just have fun. At WeeBoards, with our less serious attitude and thru our fun, snack-sized, highly customizable surfboards, we hope to change this.
Hello from Matthew and Nicole, the founders of WeeBOARDS.com, a surfboard manufacturer and online retailer based out of Seattle, WA. At WeeBoards.com customers can customize and purchase mini surfboards online while helping us to donate used surfboards to Nicaraguan kids (Groms) living in poverty.
 Matthew is a Web and Graphic Designer with Online Marketing Experience of
  over 18 Years. He grew up surfing the Santa Barbara, Ventura County area in
  Southern California and has been in and out of the Action sports industry a
  good portion of his life.
 Nicole is the primary owner and operator of WeeBoards.com as well as a stay at home mother of a 2 year old toddler. Like Matthew, Nicole grew up surfing the Santa Barbara, Ventura County area in Southern California and has always had love and respect for the ocean.
WAVES FOR NICAS, A Greater Purpose: WeeBoards.com is not just about making money selling highly customizable mini surfboards, as much fun as that is. :) 
  We have a bigger mission in sight and that's simply to share the feeling of STOKED
  that only surfing provides with the less fortunate, world-wide. WeeBoards.com
  helps do this through our side project called ""WAVES FOR NICAS"", which takes
  money from every sale and purchases used-surfboards and donates the boards to Nicaraguan kids living in poverty. It's a simple project without all of
  the red-tape that other organizations have as we strictly stick to the K.I.S.S. methodology, Keep It Simply SURFING. We use money donated and
  a percentage from every sale we make online and off, to buy used surfboards from local travelers that are looking to ditch the excess baggage on the flight home, and give the boards directly to local groms (kids) who couldn't otherwise afford to own a surfboard. We are going to document each and every giveaway on our website on a consistent monthly basis so that everyone will be able to share in the rewards of giving. And while the sport of surfing is growing by leaps
  and bounds in Nicaragua, through the ""Waves for Nicas"" project there will be more
  opportunities for these kids to get sponsored and compete in competitions internationally. We
  also want to utilize our connection with Nicaragua's premier surfing
  association ASSUR, who will be beneficial with connecting our donated boards
  with the kids that need them the most.

I was informed treatment was very expensive and had a fifty percent chance of success. Without hesitation I said ""start the treatment."" What was I gonna do without my friend? Three long days into treatment and a hefty bill to match, Piper improved and was expected to make a full recovery, I am happy to announce that she did. </p><p>Fast forward to October 2013. Piper (7) becomes sick again, very sick. She had a mucus seal in her gallbladder, and her gallbladder needs to be removed. The surgery is very risky and the best doctor for the job is on vacation. Set to return in four days, during which her gallbladder could burst which would result in her death. Like a champion she hangs on until the doctor returns and performs the surgery. For the second time in her life she beat the odds and came home. </p><p>After living through 2 near death experiences, 3 girlfriends, 4 moves and in 2 different states Piper (9) lives with Kristin, myself and our two girls. She spends most of her time begging house guests for some of their food, desperately searching out pets &amp; butt scratches, when she isn't doing those things- she's snoring, very loudly. I am obviously a little biased, but Piper is pretty lucky to have come home with someone who loved her as unconditionally as me, and it’s nice to know she loves me just as much. No matter the cost or risk I did what it took to keep my best friend healthy and happy. </p><p>Unfortunately not all are so lucky, that's where Piper's Soap Company comes in!</p><p>Your support of Piper's Soap Company will provide the opportunity to produce our high quality, healthy, handcrafted products.

Hoverboard or a.k.a self-balancing scooter, the biggest tech fails of 2015? Or the Christmas gifts of the Year in 2016 and gadget of the decade?
Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) is investigating more than 54 cases fire over 24 states in the United States. It  concludes all the hoverboard now in the market are unsafe and without a proper UL2272 certification. 

""Hoverboards are now deemed to be officially unsafe and a risk for spontaneous combustion. None of the products which have been tested for safety concerns have passed the standards as of yet and sellers are removing them."" said CPSC
The safety issues marred a perfectly  good and extremely fun board. There are thousand of Youtube video reviews confirming that the hoverboards are indeed extremely awesome.  It does not hover but rather it rolls.
We can fix it and make it even better.




We like to design and build a safe and high-quality ""legit"" hoverboard. We call it hoverboard 2.0.  A  new generation that meets or exceed the safety standard UL2272.  To make one of most affordable hoverboard in the market that we can all share and enjoy.  So, all kids can have one for their  birthday and Christmas.  We guarantee it.


The journey of building  hoverboard 2.0 is very exciting and yet challenging. It is can also immensely expensive, complex. The process can be long and lengthy. But It can be equally rewarding.  We make it safe by using the best possible design, components and manufacturing processes. We at hoverboard Nation has the right team for the challenges ahead.



We can make in affordable too! Instead of charging an exorbitant USD1799.99 or  USD1500.00 each which will be well beyond the average family. We hope to start at USD449.00 plus shipping directly from the factory to your home. Together, we can make this project a smashing success.








How we stop hoverboards from bursting into flame?
Tha battery Pack (UL2271) and the chargers 




Samsung INR battery under test -passed.

When the Li-ion cells failed or have a thermal runaway. The results are usually catastrophic.  Some may even lead to  explosion and flame. But for the cell to fail, usually, it needs a chain of events to take place. Eg, failure of multilevel protection circuits. That is usually a rare event in a well-designed system.

To prevent thermal runaway, the battery pack must be protected. We typically use multi-pronged strategies in the design. 
Firstly, using protected Li-ion 18650 Cells with built in protection circuit.   These nanocircuit board attached to the end of the cell.  read more on protected cell here.  We also considering the use cells that build with safer chemistry which vent instead of explosion and fire.

Secondly, a robust Battery Management System (BMS) to manage and protect a group of cells.  It ensures the individual cells are charged in a balanced manner. It has a wide array of functions to protect the cells during operations.  .  The BMS can be managed via Bluetooth.
UL Certified battery Charger
In the rare events that none of the protections works, our battery pack can be designed with a metal casing with release valves. We use extensively fire retardant material for shells and parts. Consideration also for hoverboard usage in an extreme condition where there may be excessive vibration. 
Thus, you are be assured there will be no spectacular explosion or fire in our products even it fails.

The hidden danger  of hoverboard

UL 2272 certification requirements
UL2272 now emphasizes on overall electrical integration. Meaning, the external circuits like the chargers, motors (wheels) and mainboard must work in harmony with the battery packs. To prevent overcharging and overcurrent which may lead to failure! Our product will be UL certified.

We are not inventing a new hoverboard but to enhance it. There are always thousand of it on youtube. The money can be better used in more productive manner.


4.0 What is the risk that the campaign may end in failure?
We believe it is extremely slim. As we have a wide experience in  assembling out of  Shenzhen.   We know the landscape in China supplies chain very well. We are not over reaching our goal. Nor trying to discover breakthrough technology.  Instead, we are trying to perfect a technology which is already increasingly mature and to make it even better and share it with you.



5.0 Why $250,000.00 or more? 

We opt for fixed funding of USD$250,000.00 as the commercialization of the hoverboard will have fix cost. Without reaching the desired threshold, it might not be financially viable.  A lot of the components are customized to fit will have MOQ (Min order qty). E.g fabricating of mainboards, Casing, Wheels etc.  Certifications are also extremely expensive.  Else we may not be able to fulfill our perks that you have ordered.
6.0 Why sell at $449.00?
Yes, you save up to 66%. The above price plus shipping. We believe it is very fair and one of  cheapest price UL certified board, in terms of quality and build.  You are the early investors should benefit on the risks taken.
7.0 What's next?
We thank you for your support. After the success  of this campaign, we will increase the range of model to a 10 inches hoverboard. We like to design an electric unicycle (EUC) for the masses too. 
 

The Hoverboard


8.0 What is the name and model of hoverboard?
 
We call it Mojowheels. Phantom Xtreme, It is an 8-inch model.  The size is proven to be the most popular and flexible to handle road condition and nimbleness as compared with the 6.5-inch.
 

9.0 What cells do you use in the battery pack?


We will be using  Samsung e.g INR 18650 or similar. E.g. LG, Panasonic, Sony. These cells use safer chemistry.  The pack is rated 36V 4.4-6.0ah, They are wired in 10 serial 2 parallel configurations. Thus 10P2S. It has a robust Battery Management System (BMS). The battery pack will be UL2271 certified to ensure safety.  Note: subject to change.
10.0 What are the features?

It will have LED lights,  powerful  and higher torque motor. Battery and power indicators,  USB charging port, GoPro Mounting point,  Other safety considerations. E.g.  When the battery level is low, it will provide warning and stop gracefully. It is managed by APP. A  smoother ride too.

11.0 What are the functions of the APP

The APP will be connected with the board via Bluetooth. It will display speed, odometer, trip meter, battery level, current, temperature etc. Users can also set the riding model to beginner, normal and advance. Balancing calibration.  We also hope to put in some error messages to help with diagnostic and repair.





12.0 What is the production capacities?


We have chosen Shenzhen, china to be the choice of manufacturer. There are virtually unlimited production capacities We use qualified contract manufacturers and the quantity can be scaled very quickly once the product becomes more mature and stable.  We hope to start with a 500 pcs per month and slowly scaling upward to 500 pieces a day.

<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Fugees Nails &amp; Hair Salon wants to set itself apart from other beauty salons that may just offer only one or two types of services. Having come from a salon where it was a one stop shop, I have an understanding of the value of having many services under one roof. It can be very frustrating for customers to be traveling to more than one salon for their nails and hair services. Especially if they have children.</p>
<p>My salon will be in Camberwell, South London. It will be children friendly, energetic, and a vibrant family atmosphere. One where client's can kick back and be transformed and beautified into the latest trends. Fugees Salon will be a place where mothers can still feel like they are up to date with the latest styles and products. Children between 6-16 can get their hair cornrowed, braided, relaxed, texterized or just a wash and style, ready for school. And men can get their hair cornrowed, locks maintained or a simple wash and blow dry.</p>
<p>In the salon I will be specializing in</p>
<ul>
<li>Acrylic Extensions </li>
<li>UV Gel Extensions </li>
<li>Silk/Fiberglass Wrap</li>
<li>Sculpture Extensions </li>
<li>Gel/Shellac polish </li>
<li>Free-hand Design/Nail Art</li>
<li>Pedicures</li>
<li>Manicures </li>
</ul>
<p>Upon commencement of operations, I would like to sell a wide range of beauty products. I will be providing quality hair, nails and skincare products. I would also have other name brand products for sale to meet the customers needs, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hair </li>
<li>Eyelashes</li>
<li>Makeup </li>

Renovations (property) £50,000
Salon Fixtures  (display,furniture & equipment) £7,000

I was born in Freiburg (Germany) and have had many stations in the world. With very few exceptions, I have remained true to gastronomy throughout my life.From gourmet restaurants to discotheques, from bistro and caterer to lounge club in Ibiza. I have successfully managed many businesses over the last 35 years.Now I am 69 and I can't imagine doing nothing from now on. For a long time I was looking for the right object and I found it with Hotel Nicklas.Banks do not see me as a businessman in my old age, but only as an old person who is going to die soon. Financial help? Not a chance.Therefore I am now asking the crowd community for help.And I'm not just interested in getting money.I want to create a hotel that leaves a green footprint that can still be seen by the next generation. New heating, new lighting. New gaskets. We have developed a cleaning and hygiene concept that reduces plastic and other packaging to a minimum. In our park area we will integrate bumblebee castles, insect hotels and hedgehog houses. A separate area will be established for dogs. Our guests have the possibility to easily cancel the room cleaning (daily). There will be many more measures of this kind.But we also want to get involved socially. So for every soup we sell we will donate a soup to a charitable organization. We will offer free overnight accomodation to particularly engaged people as a „thank you“ for their work and dedication.In short: We want to create a fair place.A fair place for humans, animals and nature.  Warum und weshalb...Mein Name ist Rolf Finkbeiner. Ich bin gelernter Hotelfachmann. Geboren bin ich in Freiburg und habe so manche Stationen in der Welt gehabt.Bis auf ganz wenige Ausnahmen bin ich mein Leben lang der Gastronomie treu geblieben. Vom Feinschmecker-Restaurant über eine Diskothek, vom Bistro und Caterer bis zum Lounge-Club auf Ibiza habe ich die letzten 35 Jahre viele Geschäfte erfolgreich geführt.Jetzt bin 69 und ich kann mir nicht vorstellen nichts mehr zu tun. Lange habe ich nach dem richtigen Objekt gesucht und es mit dem Hotel Nicklas auch gefunden.Banken und Sparkassen sehen aber im Alter in mir keinen Geschäftsmann mehr, sondern lediglich einen Menschen, der bald stirbt. Finanzielle Hilfe? Keine Chance.Daher bitte ich jetzt die Crowd-Community um Hilfe. Und dabei geht es mir nicht darum, einfach nur Geld zu bekommen. Ich möchte ein Hotel schaffen, das einen grünen Fußabdruck hinterlässt, der sich auch bei der nächsten Generation sehen lassen kann. Neue Heizung, Neue Beleuchtung. Neue Dichtungen. Wir haben ein Reinigungs- und Hygienekonzept entwickelt, das Plastik und sonstige Verpackungen auf ein Minimum reduziert. In unserer Parkarea werden wir Hummelburgen, Insektenhotels und Igelhäuser einbinden. Für Hunde wird ein eigener Bereich etabliert. Dazu kommt unser ""Gassi-Service"" (Ausführ-Service). Unsere Gäste haben die Möglichkeit ganz einfach die Zimmerreinigung (täglich) abzubestellen. Und es wird noch viele weitere Maßnahmen geben.Aber wir wollen uns auch sozial engagieren. So werden wir jeden Monat für jede verkaufte Suppe eine Suppe an die Tafel (oder vergleichbare Organisation) spenden. Wir wollen besonders engagierten Menschen kostenfreie Übernachtungen als ein Dankeschön für ihre Arbeit anbieten.Kurz: Wir wollen einen fairen Ort kreieren.Fair für Menschen. Fair für Tiere und die Natur. El motivoMe llamo Rolf Finkbeiner. Soy un profesional formado en hostelería.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I grew up in the small town of Kingstree, South Carolina. My father was an entrepreneur himself and I was raised to believe that you can achieve success from your own business through hard work, ingenuity, and humor. During high school I worked in a small gift and China shop. It was always my dream to own a business like that one! <br/><br/>Today, after moving away for college, I have returned to my hometown, married my high school sweetheart and we are raising our children in my family home which I inherited from my parents.<br/><br/>Returning to Kingstree has brought me back to my high school dream of owning my own speciality store. I chose a boutique because of my combined love of fashion and jewelry!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>My goal is to raise $10,000 which will be used as follows:<br/><br/>- purchasing $8,000 of inventory to jumpstart my displays at local events in my community<br/>- $2,000 will be devoted to marketing efforts on social media platforms<br/><br/>I plan to increase my business revenue by 100% within the next 6 months using this money as the kickstarter Krissy's needs to become the successful business I already know it to be.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I decided to start my business in January of 2017 after experiencing a traumatic injury which nearly resulted in my death. I look at my time as much more valuable and want to provide a balanced work/life environment for my children.</p>
<p>The impacts my family will see are this will allow me to work more of a non-traditional schedule and be available to actively participate in my young children's everyday lives.</p>
<p>The future goal for my business is that it will flourish and provide my family with a stable income. Also, I hope to provide my daughter with real work experience while young and then give her a legacy to be proud of and want to continue when it's my time to retire.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I come into a market that is flooded with competition which will make it challenging to acquire customers who may already be loyal to another boutique. To overcome this challenge I will</p>
<ul>
<li>Utilize my personal network to gain clients that already know me </li>
<li>Market heavily through social media platforms such as Facebook and Instagram... This is where my target customer lives online.</li>
<li>Offer unparalleled customer service and retain clients because of previous positive experiences</li>

full potential

And we
like to find same kind of people. People
who want to be happy and they do anything they can to pursuit their happiness.
People who are willing to help, if they can. 
We would
like to know your name, good people of the world!

YOU! 
   What We Need & What You Get 
We simply
want to see how many positive and good people left in the world, interested in their personal development and progress. People who feel like they can achieve more, they can help more, they can contribute more, they have a higher potential.
If YOU are one of them, you may choose to donate at least 1 dollar to support our new small business for Coaching services.


Why?
Simply because it is in YOUR power. 
And YOU
are not afraid YOU will loose 1 dollar, because YOU know that when you give,
YOU receive back ten times more in the most unexpected ways.
THANK YOU so much for supporting this project! Your money will be used to help us to build our business for helping people around the world to be positive, to succeed and to have an accomplished life.
Or maybe YOU would like to improve some skills and YOU to know what books YOU can read to learn more.

Or maybe YOU feel YOU can be an entrepreneur, but YOU do not know where to start from.




Or maybe YOU want to reduce or even get away from a phobia.

Or maybe YOU want to talk to somebody who can help YOU to find YOUR own answers related to how YOU can improve YOUR life and use all YOUR potential.

<p><b>PURPOSE OF OUR CAMPAIGN</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>We both grew up in close, community type of
environments. We love knowing our neighbours and the intimate feeling you get
when there are more friends around. We want to provide this same type of
community through Modesto. Bring people together in the most relaxing place in
the Caribbean.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1297594/files/20150315193653-get_image_home1.jpg?1426473413"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>We have been working towards this dream
before we became aware of crowd funding. This campaign allows us the unique
opportunity to secure maximum occupancy before production is completed. This
way we can guarantee the longevity of this dream and be able to create it for
you. Our dream is to open an intimate, full service resort in beautiful Belize.
In keeping with a smaller number of guests, we are able to make customer
service our priority. This entire campaign exists to provide people with a
relaxing quality of life that only Belize can show you. Let us do the work, you
sit back and enjoy.</p>
<p><b>MODESTO DESCRIPTION</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Overcrowded resorts are played out and
often do not aid in relaxation. In fact, they are quite the opposite: loud,
dirty environments filled with tourists on a rampage. The price of Resort
commodities rise continuously, making it more and more expensive to get away
every year. Their business is money, and they seek to make more constantly. </p>
<p>We want to show people a different type of
experience that relaxes you to the fullest extent, and is ridiculously low
priced. Our business is designed to share a fun and relaxing quality of life,
and it doesn’t need to cost you everything you own.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1297631/files/20150315200115-bacbb5c3-8032-404b-90ab-cd2737ce217d.1.jpg?1426474875"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>With only 40, air conditioned, one bedroom/one
bath cabanas onsite, our maximum occupancy will be roughly 80 people at any
given time. This low number allow us to provide and maintain excellent customer
service. We want our investors to be able to share in the pride, joy and
relaxation together. There is room for privacy if you wish to recharge the
batteries, or you can engage with the other investors and share in the sense of
freedom and accomplishment. <br/></p><p></p>
<p><b>MODESTO LOCATION</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>We have chosen Belize as our location for many reasons. As
Canadians, It’s very appealing to have a country within the British
Commonwealth that has tropical weather. It is also extremely beneficial that
there is no language barrier because Belize is the only country in Central America
where English is the first language. The Dollar is pegged at two to one US which means that our money is
worth twice as much, and it does not fluctuate. We love the fact that Belize is
completely self sufficient as a country. They do not outsource any goods or
services. Everything is local. The food is always fresh and packed with
nutrients as it ripens properly right here in the country. Belize is also home to the second
largest barrier reef in the world. This makes for world class fishing, diving,
and snorkeling. There is marine life found within the reef that cannot be found
anywhere else on earth. It is truly beautiful. The reef also lessens the
intensity of the waves that roll in from the Caribbean Sea. This is a big
factor when it comes to being able to enjoy the water, instead of fear it.
Everything is mellow. <br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1297549/files/20150315190857-Placencia.jpg?1426471737"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>

<p><b>MODESTO DEVELOPMENT PROCESS</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>We have organized this to be an efficient
and expedient process. We have a real estate developer here in Placencia that
has been working with us to make sure that we can begin production the moment
we get funded. When funding is acquired, the purchase of the land will take
place immediately. We have 3 different options for lots of land that will
provide us with the space we need to create this hideaway. These pieces of land
are all ready to go. Once the funding comes, we secure the best piece of
property from our options. After everything is settled, we have been informed
that we can break ground within 2 months of purchasing the land. During this
time, other stages of development will begin.</p>
<p>All forty cabanas and woodwork are being
built within Belize by the Mennonites. They make an exceptional product using
the beautiful Local wood that Belize has to offer. They have informed us that
production can start this September and then shipped to the site with more than
enough time to spare.</p>
<p>Another part of the project will be the
construction of the Infinite pool that acts as the center piece for the main
area. As everything is done locally, we have already received our quote through
the Aqua Construction &amp; Cabinet Shop. These guys are behind all of the best
work in the country, and are ready to go when we are. They are also building
our beautiful dock and lounge area out on the water.</p>The restaurant and Bar are going to be
customized shipping containers Built by our friends at Giant Containers, out of
Toronto, Canada. All things considered, investors should be looking at December
2016 as an opening date.

PURPOSE OF OUR CAMPAIGN

We both grew up in close, community type of
environments. We love knowing our neighbours and the intimate feeling you get
when there are more friends around. We want to provide this same type of
community through Modesto. Bring people together in the most relaxing place in
the Caribbean.We have been working towards this dream
before we became aware of crowd funding. This campaign allows us the unique
opportunity to secure maximum occupancy before production is completed. This
way we can guarantee the longevity of this dream and be able to create it for
you. Our dream is to open an intimate, full service resort in beautiful Belize.
In keeping with a smaller number of guests, we are able to make customer
service our priority. This entire campaign exists to provide people with a
relaxing quality of life that only Belize can show you. Let us do the work, you
sit back and enjoy.
MODESTO DESCRIPTION

Overcrowded resorts are played out and
often do not aid in relaxation. In fact, they are quite the opposite: loud,
dirty environments filled with tourists on a rampage. The price of Resort
commodities rise continuously, making it more and more expensive to get away
every year. Their business is money, and they seek to make more constantly. 
We want to show people a different type of
experience that relaxes you to the fullest extent, and is ridiculously low
priced. Our business is designed to share a fun and relaxing quality of life,
and it doesn’t need to cost you everything you own.
With only 40, air conditioned, one bedroom/one
bath cabanas onsite, our maximum occupancy will be roughly 80 people at any
given time. This low number allow us to provide and maintain excellent customer
service. We want our investors to be able to share in the pride, joy and
relaxation together. There is room for privacy if you wish to recharge the
batteries, or you can engage with the other investors and share in the sense of
freedom and accomplishment. 
MODESTO LOCATION

We have chosen Belize as our location for many reasons. As
Canadians, It’s very appealing to have a country within the British
Commonwealth that has tropical weather. It is also extremely beneficial that
there is no language barrier because Belize is the only country in Central America
where English is the first language. The Dollar is pegged at two to one US which means that our money is
worth twice as much, and it does not fluctuate. We love the fact that Belize is
completely self sufficient as a country. They do not outsource any goods or
services. Everything is local. The food is always fresh and packed with
nutrients as it ripens properly right here in the country. Belize is also home to the second
largest barrier reef in the world. This makes for world class fishing, diving,
and snorkeling. There is marine life found within the reef that cannot be found
anywhere else on earth. It is truly beautiful. The reef also lessens the
intensity of the waves that roll in from the Caribbean Sea. This is a big
factor when it comes to being able to enjoy the water, instead of fear it.
Everything is mellow. 
We have travelled the whole country and
once we landed in Placencia for the first time, we could just feel it. With
over 26 kilometers of top rated beach front in the Caribbean, the incredibly
relaxing vibe, and the fact that it is still widely unknown to many, is why we
chose this location. 
The village of Placencia was originally
settled by Nova Scotians in the 17th century. Even after all that time, the
village of Placencia has a low population of about 1500 people. There is a good
number of diversity among Belize’s local residents. From Mayans, Creole,
Garifuna, Mestizos and Mennonites that come together to make this country,
everyone is very friendly and welcoming. Everybody waves to each other. It’s
refreshing and familiar to us. Out
of the entire country, 46% of the land is protected by the government, and 90%
of that is all marine and wildlife reserves which make for excellent eco tourism
opportunities.
Whether its zip lining through the forest,
horseback riding through the mountains, or any water sport of your choice,
Belize has something for everyone.

The system the <b>'MAN' </b>had created wasn't for me, there had to be <b>a better way to do business</b>.<div>
<br/><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">We, Sancia and I, started </span><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Autonomous Republic</b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> (AR), an <b>independent advertising agency</b> and two years later it's still going strong.

<p>It's that need that spawned RetroShed.</p>
<p><b>Sancia: </b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""></span>
After working in various <b>large and small
advertising agencies</b> after the last <b>5 years</b>, I have felt as though a <b>dream had
been crushed</b>. What I thought would be an industry suited for <b>a young mother</b>
ended up being a complete nightmare. I dreamt of <b>making a difference</b> in the
world and the ""real"" world of agency life didn't allow for
that. I did not conform to the nature of the industry - but I still
strived to <b>create a change</b> and have done so today. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""></span></p>
<p></p>
<p>My husband Sarel and I started AR to <b>change
the industry standard</b> and to actually create a difference, while <b>supporting
other freelancers</b> in our industry. We have seen daily through AR, how small
<b>creative businesses struggle</b> in South Africa. They have no funds, no support
and small client leads. </p>
<p>This sparked our co-working space where we
realised that a <b>fully serviced space of like minded individuals</b> can result in
<b>more work, more leads </b>and <b>better results</b>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Michelle: </b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><b>14 years ago</b>, I decided to <b>leave my home
town</b> and take a leap into the big world. I moved to <b>Johannesburg</b>, with <b>a suit case</b> and
<b>one set of bedding</b>, not knowing what will be waiting for me on the other side.
14 years later, I find myself grown up and still in Joburg. I’ve worked for
numerous <b>big ad agencies</b> and felt it was no longer for me as I had outgrown
it. </span></p>
I decided to join two people very near and dear
to my heart (Sancia &amp; Buks). They have been <b>an inspiration</b> and <b>I believe in
their idea</b> of a coworking space to <b>unite everyone</b>, I’ve left the big world of
advertising as we know it, to help <b>make their dream come true</b>. <p></p>

</div>
<p>We've set out to create a space that
provides top quality service with no hidden costs or catches. The transparency
is easy, it's the quality that's expensive.</p>
<p>We've raised $30k and invested it furniture, a generator, decor, security, electrical, etc. Check out our progress in the updates or on our Facebook page. We need $30k need to be pay back our loans before we see a profit, and that will take a while even if we fill the space with paying members. We need an extra $10k to finish the job. A lot has been completed through bootstrapping and the help of the bank of mom and dad. I might have to sell my car to get this done, so please contribute. Below was the initial proposal for the funds, but we've had to make compromises along the way.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>$5k will go towards a <b>sustainable green power solution</b> to give our members the advantage of never having downtime during load shedding (our national electricity provider, Eskom,  is unreliable and that is a major detriment to small business men and women).</li>
</ul>
<ul><li>$15k to cover the <b>tech, furniture, decor, boardroom partitioning, sound proof booth</b> (for those annoying phone calls that nobody else wants to hear) and lastly a <b>500-in-1 Retro Arcade Game Machine</b>.</li></ul>
<ul><li>$12k to cover the <b>first 3 months rent and expenses</b>.</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>$3k to cover <b>marketing activities</b> for the first 3 months.</li>

<b>Spread the word like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich!</b> The more nuts the better.</li>

<h3>How your contribution will help us?</h3>
<p>Firstly, your contribution will <b>jumpstart our project</b> and get us faster into a position where we can <b>give back to the community</b>.</p>
<p>Our economy, including most of the world's, needs <b>more small businesses</b>. So, if we can <b>affect change</b> in however small the difference, then we're heading in the <b>right direction</b>.</p>
<p>We have <b>tons of ideas</b> to make happen: <b>apps, E-commerce websites</b> and <b>charities</b> we want to build, some our own and some businesses we want to help out. Getting our <b>first fully crowdfunded idea</b> up, RetroShed, will give us more spark to get the other ideas out of the <b>""plans for world domination""</b> closet.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>What are the risks and challenges for us?</h3>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1378717/files/20150413055642-giphy-10.gif?1428929802"" src="""" style=""""/></p>There are great challenges ahead of us, especially in the form of paying back the loans we took to setup already, but we have some leeway with that as those people only require to start seeing returns from November, 2015, onwards. To break even <b>we need 10 people in the space</b> on a full time basis, and with it being so central to creative hubs, business and residential districts, we don't foresee that as being an unobtainable goal. Our first post on Facebook, received 10 leads the day it was posted.</div>
<div>
<p>The risks are greater, having <b>invested our savings </b>and <b>acquisitions of loans</b>, there is <b>no room for error</b>. Autonomous Republic will be operating from the space and paying it's share of the rent, what it can afford, so the required amount to break even is less, and AR is doing exceptionally well at the moment with the 2nd and 3rd quarter being our most busy times of the year, the timing is right to start RetroShed.</p>
<p>All these risks and challenges do not affect the perks as it will be treated separately from our loan and rental commitments. <b>PERKS MUST BE FULFILLED. </b>We don't need trolls.</p>
<p>Having a combined <b>44 years hospitality, production, advertising and marketing </b>experience, we are the right people to get the job done. We believe that no obstacle is impossible, with the right mindset, preparation and systems in place, we can only succeed. <b>There is no other choice but forward.</b></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Other ways you can help...</h3>
<p>We appreciate that some of you won't be able to help us out with a contribution. That's OK, we still really appreciate you taking the time to learn more about what we're doing. </p>
<p>You can still really help us in the following ways:</p>

</div></div>","RetroShed Creative Workspace - Johannesburg, South AfricaHi, I'm Sarel (but everybody calls me Buks, pronounced BUCKS). And that's Sancia, my loving wife, and Michelle. The video above is the result of our social initiative attached to our new start up, RetroShed.We're opening up our very first creative coworking space, RetroShed, in the heart of Johannesburg, South Africa. We've put everything we love and own into our 1700 sq ft space, but now we need your help to get it up and running like a ""creative before a deadline"".RetroShed will be more than a coworking space with a hip freelancing workforce, kickass coffee, comfortable executive chairs and up cycled furniture, it will be a space where you can grow your business with like minded individuals as your support system and cheerleaders (not actual cheerleaders, but maybe we can organise). 
RetroShed will also be giving back to the
community. We will host free workshops offered to students/young entrepreneurs
that have big ideas and ambitions, but no experience in the world of startups, marketing, pitching
and funding. WHY? It's the right thing to do and everyone could use an ""AquaMan"" in their lives.  Probably the worst example.
Our JourneyBuks: After slaving away for 7 years for a global advertising agency and many smaller boutique agencies, I found myself demotivated, run down and quite frankly a nervous wreck. The system the 'MAN' had created wasn't for me, there had to be a better way to do business.
We, Sancia and I, started Autonomous Republic (AR), an independent advertising agency and two years later it's still going strong. The name came from the deep seated need that we all have to be free to govern ourselves.
It's that need that spawned RetroShed.
Sancia: 
After working in various large and small
advertising agencies after the last 5 years, I have felt as though a dream had
been crushed. What I thought would be an industry suited for a young mother
ended up being a complete nightmare. I dreamt of making a difference in the
world and the ""real"" world of agency life didn't allow for
that. I did not conform to the nature of the industry - but I still
strived to create a change and have done so today. 

My husband Sarel and I started AR to change
the industry standard and to actually create a difference, while supporting
other freelancers in our industry. We have seen daily through AR, how small
creative businesses struggle in South Africa. They have no funds, no support
and small client leads. 
This sparked our co-working space where we
realised that a fully serviced space of like minded individuals can result in
more work, more leads and better results. 

Michelle: 14 years ago, I decided to leave my home
town and take a leap into the big world. I moved to Johannesburg, with a suit case and
one set of bedding, not knowing what will be waiting for me on the other side.
14 years later, I find myself grown up and still in Joburg. I’ve worked for
numerous big ad agencies and felt it was no longer for me as I had outgrown
it. 
I decided to join two people very near and dear
to my heart (Sancia & Buks). They have been an inspiration and I believe in
their idea of a coworking space to unite everyone, I’ve left the big world of
advertising as we know it, to help make their dream come true. 
So what do we need?



We've set out to create a space that
provides top quality service with no hidden costs or catches. The transparency
is easy, it's the quality that's expensive.
We've raised $30k and invested it furniture, a generator, decor, security, electrical, etc. Check out our progress in the updates or on our Facebook page. We need $30k need to be pay back our loans before we see a profit, and that will take a while even if we fill the space with paying members. We need an extra $10k to finish the job. A lot has been completed through bootstrapping and the help of the bank of mom and dad. I might have to sell my car to get this done, so please contribute. Below was the initial proposal for the funds, but we've had to make compromises along the way.



$5k will go towards a sustainable green power solution to give our members the advantage of never having downtime during load shedding (our national electricity provider, Eskom,  is unreliable and that is a major detriment to small business men and women).

$15k to cover the tech, furniture, decor, boardroom partitioning, sound proof booth (for those annoying phone calls that nobody else wants to hear) and lastly a 500-in-1 Retro Arcade Game Machine.
$12k to cover the first 3 months rent and expenses.

$3k to cover marketing activities for the first 3 months.



Spread the word like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich! The more nuts the better.


What's in it for you?We're an exceptionally proud bunch, we don't want donations, so we have retro inspired perks in return for you helping RetroShed becoming an awesome place to incubate creatives and entrepreneurs. 

The Perks include:



We have a wall of honour. Get your name onto it for only $5 and we'll send you a personal thank you email as well as a photo of it.


We have awesome original retro artwork and 8bit game inspired perks: posters, sticker sheets, Laptop Skins, T-shirts, Hoodies, iPhone Skins, Notebook and pens,  Laptop Bags, Back Packs etc.



RetroShed branded gear: Laptop Bags, Back Packs, Stress Reliever balls and flat pack Laptop Stands.



Day Passes (Excluding Travel, Accommodation, Visas etc.), Yearly and Monthly Memberships (Excluding Travel, Accommodation, Visas etc.).


We are also offering five 3hour Skype Brainstorms with Autonomous Republic (check out our work, www.arepublic.co.za) for all your advertising and creative challenges and needs.




How your contribution will help us?
Firstly, your contribution will jumpstart our project and get us faster into a position where we can give back to the community.
Our economy, including most of the world's, needs more small businesses. So, if we can affect change in however small the difference, then we're heading in the right direction.
We have tons of ideas to make happen: apps, E-commerce websites and charities we want to build, some our own and some businesses we want to help out. Getting our first fully crowdfunded idea up, RetroShed, will give us more spark to get the other ideas out of the ""plans for world domination"" closet.

What are the risks and challenges for us?

There are great challenges ahead of us, especially in the form of paying back the loans we took to setup already, but we have some leeway with that as those people only require to start seeing returns from November, 2015, onwards. To break even we need 10 people in the space on a full time basis, and with it being so central to creative hubs, business and residential districts, we don't foresee that as being an unobtainable goal. Our first post on Facebook, received 10 leads the day it was posted.

The risks are greater, having invested our savings and acquisitions of loans, there is no room for error. Autonomous Republic will be operating from the space and paying it's share of the rent, what it can afford, so the required amount to break even is less, and AR is doing exceptionally well at the moment with the 2nd and 3rd quarter being our most busy times of the year, the timing is right to start RetroShed.
All these risks and challenges do not affect the perks as it will be treated separately from our loan and rental commitments. PERKS MUST BE FULFILLED. We don't need trolls.
Having a combined 44 years hospitality, production, advertising and marketing experience, we are the right people to get the job done. We believe that no obstacle is impossible, with the right mindset, preparation and systems in place, we can only succeed. There is no other choice but forward.

Other ways you can help...
We appreciate that some of you won't be able to help us out with a contribution. That's OK, we still really appreciate you taking the time to learn more about what we're doing.

<h3><u>Our Story</u></h3>
<p style=""margin-left:80px;""><i>Two Brothers.  West African and West Indies lineage.  West Philly bred.</i></p>
<p>We love <strong>everything</strong> about beer.  The ingredients. The smell. The taste. The Process. Over the years our pride and passion has grown for crafting unique and flavorful beer.  Our hometown of Philadelphia has shown us much love and we believe it is time to scale to a commercial sized brewery with a taproom and event space. To show our appreciation for your contribution we have exclusive perks at different funding tiers for all budgets.  Show your support for local and minority owned businesses by contributing today.  At the moment, we are open to investments.  If you would like to inquire about investing you can contact us at 2localsbrewing@gmail.com. </p>
<p>Two Locals was all a fantasy until one day we ordered a 1 gallon brew kit from Northern Brewer.  We made an Irish Red Ale.  After that, we took a nose dive into the brewing world.  We brewed almost every weekend in Mengistu’s backyard trying to perfect a handful of beers. We began sharing our beers with friends and family. Eventually, we started to take our beers to various local events to receive feedback.  As our confidence grew, we started thinking, ""What if we had our own brewery?"" We’ve always felt that if we can make good beer as home brewers then imagine what we could do with the quality control of a brewery.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""> </p>
<h3><strong>WITH YOUR HELP, WE CAN BRING TWO LOCALS BREWING COMPANY TO PHILADELPHIA!</strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>During the many nights of staying up late to learn about the brewing process, brewing techniques and the beer industry, we noticed there is a need for more minority brewers and breweries.  After more research, we discovered the city of Philadelphia has never had a black owned brewery! <strong>So, why not us? </strong></p>
<p>We feel that representation is important and this brewery will be an example for others to have confidence stepping into a space where they may not feel represented. Become the representation you want to see and be the change you want to see.  Our brewery will be an experience you won't find anywhere else in Philadelphia.  Our brewery will bring people together in a space that celebrates culture, music, and the arts.   What pairs better with that than <i>great</i> <strong>vibes</strong> and <i>great </i><strong>beer!?</strong></p>

<h3><strong>Knowledge is Power</strong></h3>
<p>We are on a mission to change the image of craft beer.  The Brewers Association has implemented various programs to help promote diversity in the craft beer industry over the past couple years. In 2018, the Brewers Association reported that of the 7,300 breweries in the U.S., 3.4% were owned by people of color.  1% African American and 2.4% Hispanic or Latino.  In the state of Pennsylvania there is only <strong>one </strong>other black owned brewing company. With your help we can make it TWO!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We have spent countless hours doing whatever we can to gain knowledge about the brewing process, brewing techniques, and the business.  We joined the Philadelphia Homebrew Club to hone our brewing techniques and receive critiques on beers.  With the knowledge we gained from the homebrew club, we were able to develop a recipe, which is our Nubian Brown Ale, that won us second place at a local homebrew competition. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1580245903/zfdidhvm16o4qygrdc98.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>We understand that brewing at home and brewing in a brewery are completely different.  We are committed to learning as much as we can to be as successful as we can.  On the professional level, we have spent days in the brewery of Love City Brewing Company shadowing them during the brewing and cleaning processes and asking every question that comes to mind.  Love City Brewing Company has been essential to the development of us as both brewers and entrepreneurs. </p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>Teamwork Makes the Dream work!</strong></h3>
<p>Opening a brewery is extremely expensive and not easily accomplished.  Although we have the commitment of a couple investors, they are not enough.  We are asking for your help to raise $75,000 to assist with the cost of various equipment for the brewery and taproom, kegs and keg washer, legal fees, building a cold box, and help purchase ingredients to brew. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Your contribution will prove there is a desire for more craft beer in our city,  the support of local businesses, as well as minority owned businesses, and the want for a space that is for the community and committed to building up the communities of Philadelphia.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We love the city of Philadelphia and the people in it.  Philadelphia made us who we are today.  Philadelphia is one of the largest craft beer cities in the country.  When we think of beer we think about having a fun time with people you love and having great conversations.  We think about sporting events and music concerts.  Our dream is to use this brewery not only as a means to bring people together but as a way to give back to the communities of Philadelphia and create a space that represents the arts and cultures of Philadelphia.</p>

We have spent countless hours doing whatever we can to gain knowledge about the brewing process, brewing techniques, and the business.  We joined the Philadelphia Homebrew Club to hone our brewing techniques and receive critiques on beers.  With the knowledge we gained from the homebrew club, we were able to develop a recipe, which is our Nubian Brown Ale, that won us second place at a local homebrew competition. 

 
We understand that brewing at home and brewing in a brewery are completely different.  We are committed to learning as much as we can to be as successful as we can.  On the professional level, we have spent days in the brewery of Love City Brewing Company shadowing them during the brewing and cleaning processes and asking every question that comes to mind.  Love City Brewing Company has been essential to the development of us as both brewers and entrepreneurs. 
 


 
Teamwork Makes the Dream work!
Opening a brewery is extremely expensive and not easily accomplished.  Although we have the commitment of a couple investors, they are not enough.  We are asking for your help to raise $75,000 to assist with the cost of various equipment for the brewery and taproom, kegs and keg washer, legal fees, building a cold box, and help purchase ingredients to brew. 
 
Your contribution will prove there is a desire for more craft beer in our city,  the support of local businesses, as well as minority owned businesses, and the want for a space that is for the community and committed to building up the communities of Philadelphia.
 
We love the city of Philadelphia and the people in it.  Philadelphia made us who we are today.  Philadelphia is one of the largest craft beer cities in the country.  When we think of beer we think about having a fun time with people you love and having great conversations.  We think about sporting events and music concerts.  Our dream is to use this brewery not only as a means to bring people together but as a way to give back to the communities of Philadelphia and create a space that represents the arts and cultures of Philadelphia.
