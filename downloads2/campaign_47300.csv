You make a pledge, a family gets a cow, we make the bags, and the world gets better.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1535352896/kj4outnz9s9jgzlkqvml.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>THE BASICS</strong><br/>We need to raise €50,000 to contribute 250 cows to 250 struggling families in rural villages Bagatipara and Chargat, Bangladesh. Pledge €250 to contribute a cow to a family, or buy an exclusive initiative bag or accessory where all profits go to contributing more cows to more families.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>THE COW</strong><br/>Just one cow can be the difference between simply surviving to thriving for a struggling family in rural Bangladesh. During the your donated cow’s lifetime, its health and wellness will be carefully catered to by the family, along with a project team on location. At its end-of-life, the family takes care of and sells the meat, and the rawhide is taken care of by the project team.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>THE FAMILY</strong><br/>We believe that agency and trust are key to creating strong communities. Therefore, a family which signs up to raise a cow becomes our partners, receiving special education. All families are initiated and trained in the project in collaboration with NGO <a href=""http://svalorna.org/english/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">T</a>hanapara Swallows Development Society. With a cow, the family can earn up to a year’s income from the meat, enabling whole new possibilities. Such as sending the kids to school. Building a new roof. Or re-invest in a new cow. Imagine what 250 families raising 250 cows can do.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>THE LEATHER</strong><br/>A wholly traceable and well-kept rawhide is the outcome of working in transparent, dignified partnership with local families, organizations and companies. We are building our own tannery in Bagatipara where the entire process is going to be salt-free with no harmful chemicals. There will be zero discharge. Only renewable energy from biogas and solar power will be used.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>THE BAGS</strong><br/>All <a href=""https://sandlundhossain.com/about-us/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sandlund/Hossain</a> bags are made using our custom-developed vegetable leather tanning method. Our signature lining is made by <a href=""https://thanaparaswallows.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Thanapara Swallows Development Society</a>, a woman-centered cooperative with great experience in textiles. The cloth is made with organic cotton, traditionally hand loomed and coloured with vegetable extracts.

Every aspect is handcrafted to last beautifully for generations to come. If you choose to become a Cow Funder by purchasing a bag from our limited Cow Funder Edition, your bag will be specially embossed with the initiative logo inside, marking your support. Read more about this special collection further down. In the near future, the goal is that all our bags are made by leather ultimately developed through this initiative.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>THE CONSUMER</strong><br/>Finally, the leather, bags and accessories made possible through The Cow Funder Initiative will be available to everyone. But naturally, as a Cow Funder, you will be the very first to know and receive a special deal.

The hardest lesson? There are no shortcuts if you want to make something really good. Daring to take what some may believe the long way around in order to create long-term solutions is what we’re all about. We honour this belief with a deep sense of tradition, knowledge and passion. Together with fellow compassionate people, taking pride and care in what we do.

In 1977 Anders’ parents, Inger and Jan, left Sweden for volonteer work with NGO <a href=""http://svalorna.org/english/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Swallows</a> in Bangladesh. One of the assignments to develop the leather sector. The Sandlunds lived in Bagatipara for almost two years, becoming best friends and co-workers with Tulin’s parents, Atiq and Dolly. 40 years later, our parents’ ideas for social development live on with us, where Sandlund/Hossain is the next step.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1536134887/tlkmpkhowi8mc5sawdyj.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">Let’s be honest. We launched Sandlund/Hossain out of frustration. We first started producing bags for other brands who showed interest in sustainability. However, many times this gave us a first hand experience of the so-called “the race to the bottom” in terms of quality, pricing and ultimately that coveted sustainability. So we decided to pause producing for other brands and attempt to create the bags we wanted to own and carry ourselves. Simply to see if our dream was possible. We launched our first collection in 2016, selling directly to people through our online store. We are forever thankful for the overwhelming response we’ve received from those who buy our bags and those who spread the word. And thanks to all of our customers and supporters, we’re able to launch The Cow Funder Initiative. Hopefully, the initiative can serve as an inspiration to others as well, especially in the tannery, fashion and design industry.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1536136769/vviosoadv2ntnywg8f6r.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>OUR TEAM</strong><br/>Our team is made up of 35 committed individuals, including top management. 32 of these people are skilled and committed staff in our studio.

You make a pledge, a family gets a cow, we make the bags, and the world gets better.THE BASICSWe need to raise €50,000 to contribute 250 cows to 250 struggling families in rural villages Bagatipara and Chargat, Bangladesh. Pledge €250 to contribute a cow to a family, or buy an exclusive initiative bag or accessory where all profits go to contributing more cows to more families.THE COWJust one cow can be the difference between simply surviving to thriving for a struggling family in rural Bangladesh. During the your donated cow’s lifetime, its health and wellness will be carefully catered to by the family, along with a project team on location. At its end-of-life, the family takes care of and sells the meat, and the rawhide is taken care of by the project team.THE FAMILYWe believe that agency and trust are key to creating strong communities. Therefore, a family which signs up to raise a cow becomes our partners, receiving special education. All families are initiated and trained in the project in collaboration with NGO Thanapara Swallows Development Society. With a cow, the family can earn up to a year’s income from the meat, enabling whole new possibilities. Such as sending the kids to school. Building a new roof. Or re-invest in a new cow. Imagine what 250 families raising 250 cows can do.THE LEATHERA wholly traceable and well-kept rawhide is the outcome of working in transparent, dignified partnership with local families, organizations and companies. We are building our own tannery in Bagatipara where the entire process is going to be salt-free with no harmful chemicals. There will be zero discharge. Only renewable energy from biogas and solar power will be used.THE BAGSAll Sandlund/Hossain bags are made using our custom-developed vegetable leather tanning method. Our signature lining is made by Thanapara Swallows Development Society, a woman-centered cooperative with great experience in textiles. The cloth is made with organic cotton, traditionally hand loomed and coloured with vegetable extracts. We use only YKK Excella zippers. Every aspect is handcrafted to last beautifully for generations to come. If you choose to become a Cow Funder by purchasing a bag from our limited Cow Funder Edition, your bag will be specially embossed with the initiative logo inside, marking your support. Read more about this special collection further down. In the near future, the goal is that all our bags are made by leather ultimately developed through this initiative.THE CONSUMERFinally, the leather, bags and accessories made possible through The Cow Funder Initiative will be available to everyone. But naturally, as a Cow Funder, you will be the very first to know and receive a special deal. And the more people that carry the message of social good and sustainability with them through bags that matter, the more difference we can make on all bottom lines, across all borders, for us all and the world we live in.THE TIMEPLANNow-September 30th: Campaign activeOctober 25th: First delivery of Cow Funder Edition productsDecember 1st: First distribution of cows to families≈ Fall 2020: First products made from Cow Funder Initiative Leather––––– SANDLUND/HOSSAIN: HOW WE WORKWe at Sandlund/Hossain, founded in 2016 by childhood friends Anders Sandlund and Tulin Hossain, are artisan leather bag makers based in Sweden and Bangladesh. Our mission is to make the most durable, sustainable and truly beautiful leather bags in the world.OUR BACKGROUNDSandlund/Hossain springs from Böle spruce bark tannery above Sweden’s Arctic Circle. The family-run tannery, which Anders is now proprietor and heir of, has been making leather since 1899. Böle is today the globe’s last standing spruce bark tannery as well as premium leather goods maker and Purveyor to the Swedish Royal Court.It’s fair to say that we’ve learned a few things along the way. The hardest lesson? There are no shortcuts if you want to make something really good. Daring to take what some may believe the long way around in order to create long-term solutions is what we’re all about. We honour this belief with a deep sense of tradition, knowledge and passion. Together with fellow compassionate people, taking pride and care in what we do. For ourselves, for you and the world we all share.OUR ORIGINAL COW F(O)UNDERSBoth of us, Anders and Tulin, come from generations of rather uncompromising yet practical people in small villages – Böle and Bagatipara. In 1977 Anders’ parents, Inger and Jan, left Sweden for volonteer work with NGO The Swallows in Bangladesh. One of the assignments to develop the leather sector. The Sandlunds lived in Bagatipara for almost two years, becoming best friends and co-workers with Tulin’s parents, Atiq and Dolly. 40 years later, our parents’ ideas for social development live on with us, where Sandlund/Hossain is the next step.Let’s be honest. We launched Sandlund/Hossain out of frustration. We first started producing bags for other brands who showed interest in sustainability. However, many times this gave us a first hand experience of the so-called “the race to the bottom” in terms of quality, pricing and ultimately that coveted sustainability. So we decided to pause producing for other brands and attempt to create the bags we wanted to own and carry ourselves. Simply to see if our dream was possible. We launched our first collection in 2016, selling directly to people through our online store. We are forever thankful for the overwhelming response we’ve received from those who buy our bags and those who spread the word. And thanks to all of our customers and supporters, we’re able to launch The Cow Funder Initiative. Hopefully, the initiative can serve as an inspiration to others as well, especially in the tannery, fashion and design industry.OUR TEAMOur team is made up of 35 committed individuals, including top management. 32 of these people are skilled and committed staff in our studio. All have proper salaries, paid vacation, sick leave and a savings program. Our people are our greatest assets, so we make sure to take care. Our two main HQ:s are located in Härnösand, Sweden and Dhaka, Bangladesh. We hope to grow, so if you love craftmanship, sustainability och social development the way we do, let us know!––––– THE COW FUNDER EDITIONIf you choose to become a Cow Funder by purchasing a bag from our limited Cow Funder Edition, your bag will be specially embossed with the initiative logo inside, marking your support. All bags are made using our custom-developed vegetable leather tanning method.

<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>Nearly two years ago I drew up these drawings as a weekend project in my small apartment while studying abroad in Europe. And now its become this full blown thing. Its been a monumental amount of work - but now I need your help to bring it to life. With a large minimum order quantity, crowd funding seemed like a good way to get it moving<a href=""http://www.luftverk.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">.</a> I've opted for ""All or Nothing"" funding, which means we must meet that goal or this project won't happen!<br/><br/>Please check out the campaign below. If you want to help out the best way is to pick up one of the perks in the sidebar. <strong>The price of these watches after the campaign will be 125$ so get them now!</strong> Every bit big or small helps make this project get a little closer to reality. Share it with everyone you know on every social media platform you use! Word of mouth is so powerful - it would mean the world to me!</p>

The dial is completely free of distractions, with absolutely no logos. Just 3 hands. In the age where your telephone can manage your finances and your car can stream movies, it seems rare to find objects that do just one thing. This watch has one job - to tell you the time. It adds to the ideology of this whole campaign - both conveyed with the design language and in it's beautifully simple function.<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1486421572/fei4ukr46qoqv1t0nu8e.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/>The case is machined from 316L and finished with a soft media blast. An Ion Vapor Deposition (IVD) coating is then applied to the watch case and matching buckles. The crown is slightly over-sized for easier adjustment and a more balanced aesthetic. As mentioned, the face has absolutely no branding or logos - meaning this watch can be worn on both the left and the right hand with the crown facing outwards. The only branding is a small logo on the case.<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1486421650/ycjmfqugjua5g997ktex.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1486422139/uqhbx5cclkaoazgo4izx.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/>The case back has been engraved with a very intricate design based on the Canadian maple tree. It represents both the origin of myself, as a born and raised Canadian and as the cyclic nature of time. I wanted something unique that was very personal to the customer - which is why only the wearer of this time piece will know it is there.<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1486423261/irulxavfpozywdcnl9ak.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/>The crystal is sapphire. This is one of the most expensive parts of the watch because of how scratch resistant the surface is. The combination of the solid 316L stainless steel case and the sapphire crystal should ensure it can take a beating. The crystal is pressed into a nylon gasket seal - this combined with the rubber seal on the crown makes the watch water resistant.<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1486423531/ophghxqvzwbdcfrsnojw.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1486442287/h7rfu7aylfztgdn63pqw.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/>The leather straps is a fine grain genuine leather. The main strain points are stitched for extra strength and durability. The leather is soft and supple - it molds well to the wrist and breaks in the longer you wear it. Integrated stainless buckles ensure that they do not fray or become loose over time. I went through 3 different iterations before finding something that both felt premium and was durable against every day wear and tear.<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1486424668/epp77fpotrvlpvc63yls.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1486424688/jukzjbnixiorstf5c89w.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1486424709/fejsyj0kas5vnsy7mynq.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1486424728/ry6luwncizjt2vwr3vil.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/>The movement selected for this watch is a Ronda 763. Ronda AG is a watch manufacture based in Switzerland since 1946. I wanted something that was robust - something that could survive the abuse of being worn every single day. This particular movement was chosen for its small form factor, serviceability and reliability with the 763 being a proven workhorse among many other quarts watches.

<h3>The Presentation/Packaging</h3>
</div><div><p>I love beautiful packaging. Its why I have spent a lot of time focused on making the best possible unboxing experience. I teamed up with my incredibly talented friend Aaron Davis (Seriously - check out his Instagram its nuts <a href=""http://www.instagram.com/aarondav1s/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">@aarondav1s</a>) who gave me permission to use one of his photos as a cover art for the sleeve. The photo wraps around the back of the box showcasing a beautiful waterfall located in the PNW. The tree logo adds a layer of continuity between the packaging and to the watch. A very important part of the experience.<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1486417267/jq3vupa9grsktmmuktpi.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1486417348/xc99ebdozyc1cy2fvr5t.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/>Sliding off the sleeve reveals a technical exploded view of the watch. A white ink was used instead of black to keep the overall aesthetic light. This line work was actually created directly off of an early CAD file I sent to the manufacturers. The sleeve with the photo is a matte soft touch finish while a glossy spot UV has been applied to the white badge. Although much more expensive, the textual contrast between the two look and feel very premium.<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1486417374/wlzoum9rnosinsrrsksb.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1486417395/izz92tczjo2n74bqrvdc.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/>Inside you will find the watch and a spring bar tool (for strap removal) set in high density foam. This impact absorbent foam offers protection during shipping as well as adding to the overall aesthetics. The grey color was selected for its resemblance of poured concrete. A large card is included inside with a pull tap that reveals more extras. Contact information is included in the event you need to message me regarding problems. A sticker featuring matching artwork is also included.<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1486417523/mlogaduqsf4jdcpx1oos.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p></div><div>

<br/>Extra Perk: 11 x 14 Inch Technical Print</h3>
<p>A fun little extra I made while designing the packaging - a full exploded view of the watch itself! The diagram is the same one on the box, only this one explains what each of the components are. These are printed on poser paper with the help of my friend Dwayne who is located just outside of Toronto. The frame is not included (its a $4.99 Ikea special!)<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1486679770/j8puehv8ah9bvaiyzb33.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/> </p>

<h2>The Story</h2>
<p>How did this all start? In 2015 I was studying abroad in Europe. One of my friends there mentioned they had modeled a watch for his engineering school project. At the time, I was running an e-commerce business filled with products I had designed myself and I thought that a wrist watch would be a cool thing to try. I never modeled something like a watch in CAD before, so it became my design project - a way to take a mental break on the weekends (I know I'm a total nerd).<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1486790269/g4mb2disgjcpgdrfr3x5.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/>I worked on this project on and off for a few months. When I spoke to my machinist in Asia, I briefly mentioned that I had designed a simple wrist watch. They told me that they could probably help find a production company to get a prototype made - something I actually never even considered. After some back and fourth with this company, I had a working prototype sent to me. It was a really exciting project since it was so different than what I was usually doing - and that was supposed to be the end of that.<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1486790291/jnv10ti6zgmjdjg5ueuu.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/>I took some photos posted them up on my Facebook to show some friends. I instantly got a flood of messages asking if they could purchase one. Only having a couple prototypes made I didn't know what to tell them. I was convinced that maybe I could do a small run of these watches for the friends who asked. A few of them were actually already good customers of mine.<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1486790737/tnanvsk91irem9nm6usu.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1486790830/oz7ycktmbuat9db2zac5.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/>I shifted my focus on this watch even more in 2016. People kept messaging about the watch. The production company claimed I needed a minimum order quantity to actually put this into production. So I started refining some of the designs on the watch itself. A larger more ergonomic crown. The strap was improved, actually the first one (on the left) looked great but it stretched 3 holes, then fell apart in water after my 2nd month of wearing it. Just a lot of problems that required testing it by wearing them every day. When I returned back to Canada, I got in contact with the print shop who was already making my packaging and sent them the designs I came up with. Package design is one of my favorite things to do because you have so much creative freedom. I knew if I wanted to put this thing into production it had to be absolutely spectacular.<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1486792317/ld9mogprcsfgju2i4cyy.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/>And now you are reading this page.

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Obviously with crowd funding project of this scale there are both risks and challenges, but during the last 6 months I have done my best to control both of these things to the best of my ability. I have found suppliers and manufacturers with extremely good communication and will likely travel back to their factory after the campaign finishes. My experience working with factories over seas in the past is definitely a huge asset for this project (scroll down to see the video I made documenting the product development for Skyva). This can ensure better quality control and also faster turn around time when it comes to the little details.<br/><br/>I have set a generous deadline to anticipate for delays but it is impossible to predict the future. If all goes to plan, everyone should get their watches on, or before the date. The only way it could be extended is if there is a massive production delay but at this stage is isn't likely.<br/> </p>

</div></div>","Intro
Nearly two years ago I drew up these drawings as a weekend project in my small apartment while studying abroad in Europe. And now its become this full blown thing. Its been a monumental amount of work - but now I need your help to bring it to life. With a large minimum order quantity, crowd funding seemed like a good way to get it moving. I've opted for ""All or Nothing"" funding, which means we must meet that goal or this project won't happen!Please check out the campaign below. If you want to help out the best way is to pick up one of the perks in the sidebar. The price of these watches after the campaign will be 125$ so get them now! Every bit big or small helps make this project get a little closer to reality. Share it with everyone you know on every social media platform you use! Word of mouth is so powerful - it would mean the world to me!

The Design
Feature Summery:316L Stainless Steel Case and BucklesSwiss Ronda 763 MovementSapphire CrystalGenuine Fine Grain LeatherRemovable Straps (Includes Strap Removal Tool)Water Resistant 3ATM (light rain, showers, sweat, ect)Dimensions:Case Diameter: 40mmCase Thickness: 9mmStrap Width: 20mmSmallest Wrist Circumference: 138mmLargest Wrist Circumference: 190mmFull 2 YEAR Warranty:If anything happens within the first 2 years of wearing your watch, shoot me a message! We can try and fix it together, and if we can't, I'll send out a replacement once you send yours back. This of course doesn't include regular wear and tear, abuse or accidents.When I wore this watch out in public for the first time the lug free design is one of the first things that people commented on - the strap seems to disappear seamlessly into the watch case. The dial is completely free of distractions, with absolutely no logos. Just 3 hands. In the age where your telephone can manage your finances and your car can stream movies, it seems rare to find objects that do just one thing. This watch has one job - to tell you the time. It adds to the ideology of this whole campaign - both conveyed with the design language and in it's beautifully simple function.The case is machined from 316L and finished with a soft media blast. An Ion Vapor Deposition (IVD) coating is then applied to the watch case and matching buckles. The crown is slightly over-sized for easier adjustment and a more balanced aesthetic. As mentioned, the face has absolutely no branding or logos - meaning this watch can be worn on both the left and the right hand with the crown facing outwards. The only branding is a small logo on the case.The case back has been engraved with a very intricate design based on the Canadian maple tree. It represents both the origin of myself, as a born and raised Canadian and as the cyclic nature of time. I wanted something unique that was very personal to the customer - which is why only the wearer of this time piece will know it is there.The crystal is sapphire. This is one of the most expensive parts of the watch because of how scratch resistant the surface is. The combination of the solid 316L stainless steel case and the sapphire crystal should ensure it can take a beating. The crystal is pressed into a nylon gasket seal - this combined with the rubber seal on the crown makes the watch water resistant.The leather straps is a fine grain genuine leather. The main strain points are stitched for extra strength and durability. The leather is soft and supple - it molds well to the wrist and breaks in the longer you wear it. Integrated stainless buckles ensure that they do not fray or become loose over time. I went through 3 different iterations before finding something that both felt premium and was durable against every day wear and tear.The movement selected for this watch is a Ronda 763. Ronda AG is a watch manufacture based in Switzerland since 1946. I wanted something that was robust - something that could survive the abuse of being worn every single day. This particular movement was chosen for its small form factor, serviceability and reliability with the 763 being a proven workhorse among many other quarts watches. For the more nerdy ones like myself, technical information can be found on this PDF provided by Ronda AG. 
The Presentation/Packaging
I love beautiful packaging. Its why I have spent a lot of time focused on making the best possible unboxing experience. I teamed up with my incredibly talented friend Aaron Davis (Seriously - check out his Instagram its nuts @aarondav1s) who gave me permission to use one of his photos as a cover art for the sleeve. The photo wraps around the back of the box showcasing a beautiful waterfall located in the PNW. The tree logo adds a layer of continuity between the packaging and to the watch. A very important part of the experience.Sliding off the sleeve reveals a technical exploded view of the watch. A white ink was used instead of black to keep the overall aesthetic light. This line work was actually created directly off of an early CAD file I sent to the manufacturers. The sleeve with the photo is a matte soft touch finish while a glossy spot UV has been applied to the white badge. Although much more expensive, the textual contrast between the two look and feel very premium.Inside you will find the watch and a spring bar tool (for strap removal) set in high density foam. This impact absorbent foam offers protection during shipping as well as adding to the overall aesthetics. The grey color was selected for its resemblance of poured concrete. A large card is included inside with a pull tap that reveals more extras. Contact information is included in the event you need to message me regarding problems. A sticker featuring matching artwork is also included.

Extra Perk: 11 x 14 Inch Technical Print
A fun little extra I made while designing the packaging - a full exploded view of the watch itself! The diagram is the same one on the box, only this one explains what each of the components are. These are printed on poser paper with the help of my friend Dwayne who is located just outside of Toronto. The frame is not included (its a $4.99 Ikea special!)

I teamed up with two friends of mine to create this look book. They are both very talented individuals with unique perspectives - check it out below.

We found there was a huge gap in the men’s shoe industry. Whenever you were buying shoes, you could only choose two of these qualities at best: Price, Quality, Availability.</p><p>Price and Availability = Crappy shoes made in a sweatshop with subpar materials, sold by fast fashion companies and department stores.</p><p>Price and Quality = You would have to look for sales, deals or buy second hand. This is not something you control. You must wait for the right chance if it ever happens.</p><p>Quality and Availability = Be ready to splurge, when talking about quality men shoes things can get pricey pretty fast.</p><p>We wanted to offer the 3 things. And we failed. At first. See, that’s the thing with starting a business, no matter how much you think you are prepared, things will eventually get hard and issues you never even thought of will arise. To be honest our first shoes had availability and kind of the good price thing and kind of the quality thing. Our objective was to make people feel they were stealing from us. How could such an impressive shoe cost that? Instead people were like, meh, it certainly looks and feels better than my “genuine” leather, “designer” shoes but I’m definitely not blown away.</p><p>We messed our chance to create a great first impression. we went back to the workshop to work more. Some months later, our second generation of shoes was ready. Better craftsmanship and materials, and this time we got a lot of people to be quite impressed of our shoes.

We found there was a huge gap in the men’s shoe industry. Whenever you were buying shoes, you could only choose two of these qualities at best: Price, Quality, Availability.Price and Availability = Crappy shoes made in a sweatshop with subpar materials, sold by fast fashion companies and department stores.Price and Quality = You would have to look for sales, deals or buy second hand. This is not something you control. You must wait for the right chance if it ever happens.Quality and Availability = Be ready to splurge, when talking about quality men shoes things can get pricey pretty fast.We wanted to offer the 3 things. And we failed. At first. See, that’s the thing with starting a business, no matter how much you think you are prepared, things will eventually get hard and issues you never even thought of will arise. To be honest our first shoes had availability and kind of the good price thing and kind of the quality thing. Our objective was to make people feel they were stealing from us. How could such an impressive shoe cost that? Instead people were like, meh, it certainly looks and feels better than my “genuine” leather, “designer” shoes but I’m definitely not blown away.We messed our chance to create a great first impression. we went back to the workshop to work more. Some months later, our second generation of shoes was ready. Better craftsmanship and materials, and this time we got a lot of people to be quite impressed of our shoes. But it wasn’t enough for us, so we made our shoes even better, and once they were awesome we made them even better. You get the idea. Even though our shoes are great we will never stop trying to make the best shoes money can buy, with the only difference you won’t have to spend so much money.

first few weeks, it’s therefore easy to understand why so many mothers have
difficulty remembering which side to feed from next.</span></p>
<p>The Mumba clasp is designed to support mothers especially in the
early weeks when sleep deprivation can add to a mother’s inability to remember which
breast she last fed on. It’s also designed to support a busy and exhausted mother at
any stage off her breastfeeding journey.</p>
<p>Alternating breast and regular feeding is the recommended way for
breastfeeding mothers to maintain good milk supply in both breasts and to avoid
painful engorgement which could lead to mastitis.</p>
<p>The Mumba clasp is permanently fixed to the bra and a uses a unique two
hook design system, which allows mums to easily track which side to feed, when simply
opening and closing her bra, before and after every feed.</p>

<p><span>HOW TO USE THE MUMBA CLASP REMINDER </span></p>1. To feed, always choose the <b>LOWER NUMBER </b>of the two
hooks. <p></p>
<p><i><span>For example if the hooks are on numbers 1 and 2, you would
choose number 1. </span></i></p>
<p><span>2. When finished, always return the hook, to the <b>HIGHER
CONSECUTIVE NUMBER</b>, to the opposite hook. </span></p>
<p><i><span>For example if feeding and the opposite hook is on number 2,
return the hook to number 3 to close. </span></i></p>
<p><span>3. Lastly when the hooks are on numbers 1 and 4, always <b>CHOOSE
NUMBER 4</b>. This is the only time when the LOWER NUMBER does not apply. W</span><span>hen
finished</span><span> as always</span><span>,</span><span> return the hook, to the <b>HIGHER CONSECUTIVE NUMBER</b>, to
the opposite hook </span></p>
<p><span>The numbers <b>1</b> and <b>4</b>, have been </span>colored to alert

<p>The BabyFocus print is inspired by babies and research by
neuroscientist and development psychologist on visual stimulation for babies.</p>
<p>Researchers have repeatedly proven that newborns prefer to look at black and
white geometric shapes and that these patterns provide babies with something
simple yet engaging to focus on, and in this intense concentration it allows
their minds to rest. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p> Breastfeeding is a new experience for a newborn and although instinctive it’s a skill that they’ll have to learn like many others.</p>
<p>Unlike any other nursing bra, the Mumba Bra recognizes that a baby’s contribution to successful breastfeeding is just as important as their mothers.<br/></p>

<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">When my daughter was born I knew breastfeeding and breast milk was the best choice. But in 2011 a few weeks after of her birth, I started experiencing some of
the common breastfeeding problems. What seemed like the simplest thing of remembering
which breast I last fed my daughter from and which to feed from next, soon became
impossible.  So</span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""> I used to note it down on a piece of paper and I even bought a breastfeeding reminder bracelet in a desperate attempt to make things easier. But after using them, I felt that these accessories were adding to my problems, as they were never to hand when I needed to feed her. </span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Because of this my breast felt painful and engorged from not alternating breast when feeding.</span><br/></p>
<p>I also found that my daughter was constantly and easily distracted
by anything in the room whilst feeding, She would pull away when distracted with my nipple in tow, which as you can imagine was very painful. I started dreading
breastfeeding and wanted to give up. </p>
<p>But having breastfed my first child for a year, I didn’t want to just give up. I knew that breastmilk was best for my baby and so I was determined to persevere through the pain and give her what I believed to be the best start in life. It was then, in my moment of despair that I was inspired  to create the Mumba Bra.</p></span></h3>

SUPPORT OUR MUMBA BRA CAMPAIGN</b>
</h4>
<div><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""><br/></b></div>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;""></p>
<p>Breastmilk
is the best start a mother can provide for her baby. Various medical organisations
have extensively researched breastmilk and verified the substantial beneficial
effects breastfeeding has on the lives of babies, mothers and children. Data published in <b> <a href=""http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/01/160129090120.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Lancet report</a> </b>in January 2016 reported that increasing breastfeeding rates worldwide could prevent over<b> 800,000 child deaths and 20,000 deaths from cancer every year.</b></p>
<p>The researchers said that it was a ""widespread misconception"" that breastfeeding was only beneficial in poor countries. Nothing could be further from the truth. Professor Cesar Victor added that ""our work clear shows that breastfeeding saves lives and money in all countries rich and poor alike""</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We understand that breastfeeding
can be difficult, so the Mumba Bra aims to prepare and support BOTH mother and baby,
right from the onset and throughout of their breastfeeding journey, so that
some of the common breastfeeding problems can be avoided. We can then <b>#makeadifference </b>to the breastfeeding
statistics that reports the low numbers of mothers initiating breastfeeding and even more disturbing, the greater number of mothers giving up.</p>
<p>So please back us and help millions of mothers succeed in
achieving their breastfeeding goal and allow more babies to get the best start
in life they deserve.                                           Together we can <b>#makeadifference</b></p>

<p>It’s a well-known fact that when breastfeeding you regularly
forget which breast to feed your baby from next. Additionally it isn’t always easy
to keep your baby’s attention focused on the breast whist breastfeeding. As
your baby grows they can become easily distracted. The Mumba Bras unique design
features solves these problems and incorporates the solution onto your nursing
bra. This means no more breastfeeding reminder bracelets, mobile apps and necklaces
used to focus babies attention or any other additional accessories to carry
around. Your Mumba bra is always close to you, ready to support you. Giving you more time to focus on you and your baby.</p>

</div></div>","Presenting the revolutionary Mumba Bra. The only nursing bra designed for BOTH mum and baby





We’ve
reinvented the nursing bra because so many mothers want to breastfeed, but
sadly, a large number of those who start or plan to start never make it past the
first few days. 
So
we’ve created the Mumba Bra to prepare and support BOTH mother and baby
on their breastfeeding journey. 

Enabling more mothers to initiate breastfeeding and
continue for as long as she wants to.





Some of the most frequently cited reasons by mothers for
discontinuing with breastfeeding are:



The Mumba Bra
incorporates two great innovations to
address these problems and take babies contribution to successful breastfeeding
into consideration.



The Mumba Bra incorporates unique design features for BOTH Mum and Baby.






The patented Mumba clasp is a world’s
first. 
A bra clasp which also functions as a breastfeeding reminder to help
mums quickly and easily track which breast to feed from next.





 Every breastfeeding mother knows how often a newborn feeds in the
first few weeks, it’s therefore easy to understand why so many mothers have
difficulty remembering which side to feed from next.
The Mumba clasp is designed to support mothers especially in the
early weeks when sleep deprivation can add to a mother’s inability to remember which
breast she last fed on. It’s also designed to support a busy and exhausted mother at
any stage off her breastfeeding journey.
Alternating breast and regular feeding is the recommended way for
breastfeeding mothers to maintain good milk supply in both breasts and to avoid
painful engorgement which could lead to mastitis.
The Mumba clasp is permanently fixed to the bra and a uses a unique two
hook design system, which allows mums to easily track which side to feed, when simply
opening and closing her bra, before and after every feed.



Using the Mumba Clasp is as easy as 1,2,3.





HOW TO USE THE MUMBA CLASP REMINDER 1. To feed, always choose the LOWER NUMBER of the two
hooks. 
For example if the hooks are on numbers 1 and 2, you would
choose number 1. 
2. When finished, always return the hook, to the HIGHER
CONSECUTIVE NUMBER, to the opposite hook. 
For example if feeding and the opposite hook is on number 2,
return the hook to number 3 to close. 
3. Lastly when the hooks are on numbers 1 and 4, always CHOOSE
NUMBER 4. This is the only time when the LOWER NUMBER does not apply. When
finished as always, return the hook, to the HIGHER CONSECUTIVE NUMBER, to
the opposite hook 
The numbers 1 and 4, have been colored to alert
you.

breastfeeding mums say about the unique Mumba clasp








The original BabyFocus print
                                                 


The BabyFocus print is inspired by babies and research by
neuroscientist and development psychologist on visual stimulation for babies.
Researchers have repeatedly proven that newborns prefer to look at black and
white geometric shapes and that these patterns provide babies with something
simple yet engaging to focus on, and in this intense concentration it allows
their minds to rest. 


 Breastfeeding is a new experience for a newborn and although instinctive it’s a skill that they’ll have to learn like many others.
Unlike any other nursing bra, the Mumba Bra recognizes that a baby’s contribution to successful breastfeeding is just as important as their mothers.

               
Because of this we developed the original BabyFocus print to focus
baby’s attention and soothe and relax babies whist feeding helping a newborn take
to the new experience of breastfeeding.
After
the calm of the womb, babies are welcomed in the world where there is so much
going on and their minds can become completely overwhelmed. The BabyFocus print
is therefore perfectly placed to capture and soothe babies at feeding time.


Comments
from existing research on black and white and visual stimulation for babies.

The benefits of achieving your breastfeeding goals with the Mumba Bra



           
                                
                

                     


Our quest is to #makeadifference 
We want every breastfeeding mother and her baby to receive the optimal benefits from breastfeeding. The Mumba Bra is the world's first nursing bra to incorporate unique multi-functional features as a response to breastfeeding mothers needs and offer you support in more ways than one.
                                              
MY STORY
Hi,
my name is Elizabeth Morana, I’m a mother of two and the inventor of the Mumba
Bra. 


                           

When my daughter was born I knew breastfeeding and breast milk was the best choice. But in 2011 a few weeks after of her birth, I started experiencing some of
the common breastfeeding problems. What seemed like the simplest thing of remembering
which breast I last fed my daughter from and which to feed from next, soon became
impossible.  So I used to note it down on a piece of paper and I even bought a breastfeeding reminder bracelet in a desperate attempt to make things easier. But after using them, I felt that these accessories were adding to my problems, as they were never to hand when I needed to feed her. Because of this my breast felt painful and engorged from not alternating breast when feeding.
I also found that my daughter was constantly and easily distracted
by anything in the room whilst feeding, She would pull away when distracted with my nipple in tow, which as you can imagine was very painful. I started dreading
breastfeeding and wanted to give up. 
But having breastfed my first child for a year, I didn’t want to just give up. I knew that breastmilk was best for my baby and so I was determined to persevere through the pain and give her what I believed to be the best start in life. It was then, in my moment of despair that I was inspired  to create the Mumba Bra.

                   THE MUMBA BRA JOURNEY FROM CONCEPT TO PRODUCT







                 

We want to bring the beauty and elegance of our current range into our seamless advanced 4-way stretched nursing bra. The use of this fabric allows us to support mothers from the pregnancy stage right through to breastfeeding. As the luxuriously soft fabric is adaptable to a mothers changing shape as its able to stretch up to 2-3 bra sizes 






WHY
SUPPORT OUR MUMBA BRA CAMPAIGN



Breastmilk
is the best start a mother can provide for her baby. Various medical organisations
have extensively researched breastmilk and verified the substantial beneficial
effects breastfeeding has on the lives of babies, mothers and children. Data published in  The Lancet report in January 2016 reported that increasing breastfeeding rates worldwide could prevent over 800,000 child deaths and 20,000 deaths from cancer every year.
The researchers said that it was a ""widespread misconception"" that breastfeeding was only beneficial in poor countries. Nothing could be further from the truth. Professor Cesar Victor added that ""our work clear shows that breastfeeding saves lives and money in all countries rich and poor alike""

We understand that breastfeeding
can be difficult, so the Mumba Bra aims to prepare and support BOTH mother and baby,
right from the onset and throughout of their breastfeeding journey, so that
some of the common breastfeeding problems can be avoided. We can then #makeadifference to the breastfeeding
statistics that reports the low numbers of mothers initiating breastfeeding and even more disturbing, the greater number of mothers giving up.
So please back us and help millions of mothers succeed in
achieving their breastfeeding goal and allow more babies to get the best start
in life they deserve.                                           Together we can #makeadifference

How does the Mumba Bra help me?

It’s a well-known fact that when breastfeeding you regularly
forget which breast to feed your baby from next. Additionally it isn’t always easy
to keep your baby’s attention focused on the breast whist breastfeeding. As

features solves these problems and incorporates the solution onto your nursing
bra. This means no more breastfeeding reminder bracelets, mobile apps and necklaces
used to focus babies attention or any other additional accessories to carry
around. Your Mumba bra is always close to you, ready to support you. Giving you more time to focus on you and your baby.

<p>Panzer is an unique watch. So unique that most of you probably have never seen it in the world before this campaign was launched. Because I kept it as a top secret until one day I showed a prototype to my old sister. Yes, I was preparing to give it as her wedding gift. My dear sister always kind to me. ""Hm, COOOL."" she said, ""But how does it work? Must I get the time by counting the tree rings? "" She is a biologist.</p>

<p><strong>So how does it work?</strong></p>
<p>Following GIF may tell. <i>The user interface is as same as the real display of Panzer.</i></p>

<p>*<i>Please note the given GIFs don't show all the functions such as ""battery life check"" and ""cancel time-setting"".</i></p>
<p><strong>How to trigger different functions?</strong></p>
<p>Since one button is too few to switch among different modes, a 4-direction detector sensor was added. That is:</p>
<p><i>A particular angle of watch rotation </i><strong>+</strong><i> A button click  </i><strong>=</strong><i> Display modes shift / Functional selection.</i> <i>The given examples also do not show these actions.</i> </p>

<h3>Dice Numeral Font, Count Your Time</h3>
<p>Panzer's ""screen"" is a 7x7 LED matrix. Although it has much bigger pixels, the resolution is only  1/20,571 of the iPhone 7. It's a real challenge to display HH:MM  simultaneously on such a tiny matrix.</p>
<p>Inspired by Mahjong and dice, luckily I find a way out for displaying numerals: just count the lighted LED(s) on the 3x3 sub matrix, three is 3, four is 4,etc. Even Aliens can understand it.</p>
<h3>A Smart Watch?</h3>
<p>No. However, since it allows you to program it yourself through USB-MCX cable, you can make it smarter*.</p>
<p><i>*Backers who interested in programming of this watch could contact me in personal.</i></p>

Panzer is an unique watch. So unique that most of you probably have never seen it in the world before this campaign was launched. Because I kept it as a top secret until one day I showed a prototype to my old sister. Yes, I was preparing to give it as her wedding gift. My dear sister always kind to me. ""Hm, COOOL."" she said, ""But how does it work? Must I get the time by counting the tree rings? "" She is a biologist.

So how does it work?
Following GIF may tell. The user interface is as same as the real display of Panzer.

*Please note the given GIFs don't show all the functions such as ""battery life check"" and ""cancel time-setting"".
How to trigger different functions?
Since one button is too few to switch among different modes, a 4-direction detector sensor was added. That is:
A particular angle of watch rotation + A button click  = Display modes shift / Functional selection. The given examples also do not show these actions. 

Hidden-display
The LED light is filtered by thin wood case, making it suitable to check time in the darkness or under dim light.

Dice Numeral Font, Count Your Time
Panzer's ""screen"" is a 7x7 LED matrix. Although it has much bigger pixels, the resolution is only  1/20,571 of the iPhone 7. It's a real challenge to display HH:MM  simultaneously on such a tiny matrix.
Inspired by Mahjong and dice, luckily I find a way out for displaying numerals: just count the lighted LED(s) on the 3x3 sub matrix, three is 3, four is 4,etc. Even Aliens can understand it.
A Smart Watch?
No. However, since it allows you to program it yourself through USB-MCX cable, you can make it smarter*.
*Backers who interested in programming of this watch could contact me in personal.
Smart is What the Smart Wear
Not very reasonable, but it's true. Smart is what the smart wear. 




USB-MCX Cable & Genuine Leather Strap
The gilded USB-MCX cable plays two roles: power charging and program downloading. You can charge Panzer by the USB ports on your laptop,  5V DC output adapters or power bank. The USB plug is also made of hardwood.
The strap is made of top layer cattlehide, strong, soft and sweat-absorbing. There will be more colors for you to choose if we win this campaign. 

*Please note these chestnuts are not for sale.
The Package
Haven't decided yet. I prefer to cut a deep slot in a piece of maple, beech or walnut, and then put the whole watch in. 


 ​I've tested dozens of woods that from Africa, Europe, India, Southeast Asia and South America, but only a few are qualified. Following woods are selected as the perks:

1. Blood Padauk [Red LED]
The fresh wood has a blood-red color (especially in the sun). As time goes, it will turn to dark red. It's very hard,  heavy and has a pleasing scent.
2. Pau Rosa [Red LED]
Has a beautiful wavy grain. It's also hard, with a high natural luster.
3. Olive [Warm-white LED]
If I have to select one kind of wood to live with the rest of my life, I will choose Olive with no hesitate. It's hard, smooth and has a sweet fruit scent. If I was a white dove, what else could it be to carry with if not olive branch?
4. Huaqi-nan [Warm-white LED]​
The entire internet cannot tell me what it actually is except some pages say ""it's a kind of vine from Southeast Asia."" Tell me its Latin name if you sure. It has a beautiful figure and color. 
5. Tauari [Warm-white LED]​
Also known as ""Brazilian Oak"". In general, it 's for solid wood flooring use. It is a very good wood material on strength and dimensional stability on hot & wet conditions. 
6. Verawood [Warm-white LED]​
Verawood is extremely hard, heavy, oily, and have a feathered grain pattern. It has a distinct, perfume-like fragrance that lingers even after it has been machined. The color tends to ""green"" with age, especially upon exposure to light.
7. Bocote [Warm-white LED]​
Bocote is a born artist. With its striking and bold figuring, Bocote can be a very eye-catching wood. 
How It's Made & History Reversions
My DIY CNC is a real workhorse. Since I lack of woodworking machines, it plays a main role for making prototypes. 
And sanding, a lot of sanding. Unlike metal, plastic or glass, wood needs sanding again and again to accomplish a good look. Although with the help of CNC, it's still very time-consuming.

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Naturally Temperature Regulating</strong><br/>You'll be kept warm when it’s cool and cool when it’s warm. How?<br/>Unlike cotton, which tends to get clammy, Merino wool absorbs the moisture from your skin and releases it to the environment. This means that it can still keep you fresh even when wet. This also means that it dries faster than most fibers.</li>
<li>
<strong>Naturally Anti-Bacterial</strong><br/>Thus naturally odour resistant, which means that you can wear it without washing for daaaays... which also means that you would be doing less laundry thus using less water!</li>
<li>
<strong>Double-ply Toques</strong><br/>For added functionality, warmth and comfort</li>
</ul>

<h3>____<br/><br/>Our Story: The long &amp; short of it</h3>
<p><strong>""Project  Vdora""</strong></p>
<p>In the past year, I have been able to live, work and travel abroad. It's an amazing opportunity that I will forever be grateful for. While overseas, I was told by people, ""<strong>Que vidorra tienes!</strong>"" which translates to ""What a life you have!"" Indeed, I felt blessed. But I wanted to share this gift. I wanted people to simply say ""<strong>What a life!</strong>"" - an all encompassing statement.

With the help and expertise of local seamstresses, w/ over 20 years of experience and diverse backgrounds, we're able to deliver these smart solutions. [ Thanks, Salma & DeDe ]

About Our 100% Merino Versa Line:
Smart, Versatile and SustainableSMARTOur Versa Toques & Throws will keep you fresh and comfortable for days:


Naturally Temperature RegulatingYou'll be kept warm when it’s cool and cool when it’s warm. How?Unlike cotton, which tends to get clammy, Merino wool absorbs the moisture from your skin and releases it to the environment. This means that it can still keep you fresh even when wet. This also means that it dries faster than most fibers.

Naturally Anti-BacterialThus naturally odour resistant, which means that you can wear it without washing for daaaays... which also means that you would be doing less laundry thus using less water!

Double-ply ToquesFor added functionality, warmth and comfort


Our Versa Toques & Throws can be worn everywhere. They are...


LightThe Versa Toque and Throw are so light that everyone who has tried them so far has been surprised by how cosy they are. 

StealthAn interior secret cash stash in case you need to creatively hide your valuables. This is most beneficial when walking through streets or crowd where there is a high risk of pick-pocketing. This also becomes beneficial for women (generally speaking) who don't have pockets & just need to carry emergency cash without wanting to carry a purse.


Good-lookingOur toques are simple yet fashionable. You can wear them out in the mountains or to compliment your suit as you run from meetings to meetings downtown.

Easily StorableOur 100% Merino Versa Toque can be easily folded and kept in your pocket or hung.Our 100% Merino Versa Throw can easily fit in a purse; rolled up or folded.

VERSATILEWear the VERSA TOQUE multiple Ways:


Toque (Beanie)Wear it as a hat.

Open ToqueWear it as a hat even with your hair up! Perfect for ponytails, man buns and dreads.

Ear Warmer / Head BandWhen you just want to keep your ears warm without messing your hair.

ScarfWhen you need a neck warmer instead.

Mask""Sometimes the wind hurts my face""


Get creative with the VERSA THROW. Here are some ways you can wear it:


ThrowUse it as a blanket at home, at camp, on the plane, wherever!

Hooded CapeIt's our favourite look.

Wrap Around Shawl/PonchoThis one's great if you're feeling stylish and want to feel extra comfy

Open Shawl/PonchoWhen you just want to throw it on quickly

ScarfSimply let it dangle around your neck or get creative with your twists


SUSTAINABLEWe work with eco-certified suppliers. Our Versa Line is made of 100% Merino wool, which is a natural resource. They are:


RenewableWool is an organic and renewable resource. 

BiodegradableBecause wool is all-natural, it's biodegradable.

Recyclable (or Can Be Repurposed)Our durable hem tags are made of (scrap or repurposed) leather.

 
MADE IN TORONTOWe support local seamstresses, production companies and manufacturers. Because it's accessible to us, we get to oversee the process and ensure quality, care and ethical labour practices.
 
Why should you invest in the Versa Line?
We strongly advocate buying less disposable fashion and buying with more consideration.
We believe that we don't need harsh chemicals that stay in the environment for decades to provide you with quality apparel. Nature's got it all.

 
Pricing & Perks:
The available perks are located to the right of this page.Here are some stuff you should know: 

The Early Bird perk is for those who believe in us early on. Be one of the first 75 to support us by Boxing Day (Dec 26) to be eligible to receive the Early Bird perk.When you contribute $40 CAD of more, you can avail an IndieGoGo Special perk. No need to wait 'til we release the items on our online shop... and because these are perks/gifts, no retail tax either! 
The Toronto (Soft) Launch PartyOne of the values we live by when travelling is to learn about and respect the local culture. We practice the same in our own community. We want to show locals and visitors alike what our city has to offer. The launch party aims to do just that. Picture a small venue with a bar and local musicians serenading you as you meet likeminded folks who, like you, support the Vdora lifestyle.This said event will be held on the last weekend of January. The details will be announced at least 2 weeks prior to the event. When you grab this perk, your name and info will be added to the guest list. You will receive a confirmation e-mail along with the event details at least 2 weeks before the event.Fun Fact: Project Vdora's 100% Merino Versa Line logo pays tribute to ""the six"" / Toronto  
 

Fit/Sizes/Colour:



Backers will be sent a survey where they can choose the size & colour.  
Timeline:
Our aim is to deliver the Versa Line to your doorstep by February 2017.As of December 15,we are waiting to run the first batch of production. We are testing out alternatives to the first failed batch of scrap leather used for hem tags (they were too brittle) & screen printing care instructions on the organic woven pockets that we are using for the toques.
____Our Story: The long & short of it
""Project  Vdora""
In the past year, I have been able to live, work and travel abroad. It's an amazing opportunity that I will forever be grateful for. While overseas, I was told by people, ""Que vidorra tienes!"" which translates to ""What a life you have!"" Indeed, I felt blessed. But I wanted to share this gift. I wanted people to simply say ""What a life!"" - an all encompassing statement. I wanted to be able to help people enjoy the simple things in life, preserve the beauty of the world, and find ways to help those in need to make their situation a little bit easier. *Ding! Project Vdora was conceived.

Personal Stylist so I could at least understand why some things work and others

which includes body shape/proportion, color and style personality you look and feel amazing!

</div><div><i>-PERFECTLY.ME Team</i></div><br/></div>","This campaign will help kick off our business. We will use these funds to develop our new line of Personalized Apparel. As you choose your perk – either a style service or a beautifully constructed and personalized garment, know that you are not only getting something for yourself but you are helping us build a much needed business.
Each of us is unique in wonderful and beautiful ways. Different shapes, sizes, colors, personalities and lifestyles. It is our differences that make us who we are and our unique features that make each of us special. So, why can't our clothing reflect that too?I went about trying
to figure out how to solve this problem. Along the way I became a Certified
Personal Stylist so I could at least understand why some things work and others
don’t in simply putting together a “look”.  I found there is an interesting science
behind the art of styling. When you match up a person’s individual “style code”
which includes body shape/proportion, color and style personality you look and feel amazing! If you leave one of those elements out – something is missing.          - Terri Ghio C0-Founder, CEO and Chief RainmakerWhat we do is easy, quick and creative. You meet with a personal stylist (in-person or online) and she puts together your Style Code. Now sit back, let us take care of you and bring the fun back to shopping. We will create clothes together that will flatter your body in the right color and style details (trust us it is a three legged stool – you need them all). It is interactive and fun and the professional help you get is from Certified Stylists who really want and know how to make a difference for you.



Your garments will be personalized to you. There are at least 8,000 different possibilities.We're on Indiegogo to raise funds to take us to our next level of development:
Test new styles and patterns
Secure access to even more fabric & trims options
Create a world class shopping experience for you on our website
Support our Indiegogo Campaign and do something for yourself or your daughter, mother, sister, best friend or colleague. Your contribution will help us make this vision a reality so we can help you build the wardrobe of your dreams.

<h2>What is Tracky?</h2>
<p>How do you  picturise your sportswear? <br/>
            Smart,  focussed and spontaneous- just like you <br/>
            and the  intelligence to see beyond what you see... <br/>
            If that’s  true, then come and get Tracky, as this is where your search culminates!<br/>
            Close to  your body with the minute sensors, always sensing, monitoring and analyzing  your heart rate and body temperature. Your complete work out report in your  phone in a matter of moments- it is that unbelievably simple. <br/>
            Now, here is  your personal coach at it best!</p>
<p><br/>
</p>
<h2>What Tracky tracks? </h2>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Body Movements:</strong> Be it any form of physical activity, Tracky  systematically traces the corresponding action points. Run, dribble, stretch,  do yoga or any customised exercise and Tracky will let you know the impact.</li>
<li>
<strong>Heart rate:</strong> The net impact of the work out regime and the health is reflected  in the subtle variations of the heart rate before any other physical signs.  Tracky uses this information as an input to analyse your optimum point so that  you reap the maximum benefit of your workout without fatigue.</li>
<li>
<strong>Body Temperature:</strong> The major parameter that is used to let you know  to stop, rest and cool off because Tracky knows that the more energy that you  use, the more your body temperature will be.</li>
<p> </p>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h2>What Tracky can do?</h2>
            Tracky is  your expert advisor in sports science. You know your workout in terms of the  efficiency and impact it has on your body by having a look at the meaningful data  and intelligent feedback by Tracky and there is more to it than just graphical  interpretations.<br/>
            Name the method  of work out and Tracky knows it. Create anything new and Tracky learns it  alongside you. And Tracky knows- it’s all about efficiency and end result, and it’s  most important to keep the rate of injury to the minimum possible level.<br/>
            For  instance, Tracky points out if your stretching is not having the adequate  efficiency, if your posture needs correction during yoga, or the angle of your  feet is not appropriate while track running.<br/>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>Who can use  Tracky?</h2>
<p><br/>
          The answer is anyone! Anyone who loves to stay fit or achieve a fitness  milestone including athletes who want to do it with a blend of fun and  sytematicity, coach or trainer who is sharp to the details, researchers or  biomechanical scientists who would like to explore the uniqueness of Tracky.<br/>
</p>
<p><strong>The Ardour Gym work-outs:</strong><br/>
          To hone every moment of the work out to perfection, Tracky counts your  workout, systematically analyzes and provides you with live feedback. Be proud  as you see yourself improving every minute, every hour and everyday as Tracky  provides you the efficiency report as time progresses. <br/>
</p>
<p><strong>The Yoga  devotees:</strong><br/>
          A perfect yoga pose was previously achieved by years and years of  practise- not anymore! Tracky can help you achieve that perfect, most effective  and most powerful asanas with a specific time frame. Tracky understands the  principles of yoga and guides you to the perfect posture by monitoring the  heart rate and temperature as well as the body movements. <br/>
</p>
<p><strong>The Sports  enthusiasts:</strong><br/>
          Defying the  concept of one sport at a time, Tracky is powerful enough to understand and  incorporate multiple sports. To begin with, Tracky is all set to be with the  athletes and players of Running, cycling, boxing, tennis and soccer. Whether,  it is a jab, hook, dribble, pass, swing or volley, Tacky analyses your  movements, skills and techniques. Tracky is in the process of being  incorporated for all other sports items in the near future.<br/>
          We are also  providing open API, so that developers also can create own apps for new sports.<br/>
          If you have  any queries, related to open API / Developer kit, please do not hesitate to  drop an email to us. We will be happy to revert back to you with all details.</p>
<p><br/>
<strong>The Trainers &amp; Coaches</strong><br/>
    Sharper and precise  than an athlete in understanding- that is what a coach is. Tracky is specially  designed to make a better and accurate understanding of the body of the athlete  by giving detailed graphical reports. Considering the impact of the movements  even considering the subtlest of the indications and criteria, Tracky helps the  coaches and trainers in reaching a more suitable decision for the training.<br/>
    Sharing the  comparative report of the current pattern and the desired pattern helps your  trainee to move ahead in the desired direction with more understanding. The  result is a faster, better and positive result with minimum effort and time.</p>
<p><br/>
<strong>The Bio-mechanical Researchers </strong><br/>
    Our vision  is a world where the products of R&amp;D should be accessible to be studied  upon, developed upon and to be loved. We just did that with Tracky. Sports  sciences till now was accessible only to the elite athletes due to  affordability and non comprehensible technology for a layman, which hindered  the passion to possess a device.</p>
<p><br/>
          Here, we  come with the revolution that takes technology to everyone. We invested  tremendous amount of energy for building the algorithm to give detailed reports  on biomechanical analysis, comparative study and performance evaluation for all  the enthusiasts to use and create a beautiful world of sports based on science.</p>
<p><br/>
</p>
<h2>How Tracky works?</h2>
<p><br/>
          The sensor  strap of Tracky is seamlessly integrated with a 9– axis motion sensor. Each  individual sensor is capable of capturing the whole movement of the body in a  3-dimensional space and sends all the captured data to a beautifully designed  hub. Hub collects all the data, processes it and sends it to IOS/Android  devices through Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. <br/>
          In the  absence of Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, the hub has an internal storage where it stores  the data which can be transferred to your phone when you have access to Wi-Fi  Bluetooth. You will also be able to transfer it to your desktop or mac later  after you sync it phone by using USB cable. We just made it safe and easy for  you as all the data is stored in secured cloud server as well.<br/>
          The entire  system of Tracky wear including the hub is incredibly light weight and designed  keeping the biomechanics in mind so that it is the most comfortable wearable  technology that does not disturb even the extreme and fastest body movements.</p>
<p><br/>
</p>

<p><b>Alvin:</b> After graduating from a college in Singapore, I made my first step into the working world as a sales executive, where exchanging name cards was part of my everyday ritual.That is when I realized that my cards crease so easily in my traditional wallet. I set out to look for something that can not only keep my cards crisp and in presentable condition, but something that also looks sleek. After a long, fruitless search in stores, I sought out my childhood friend, Klain, and we took things into our own hands.</p>
<p><b>Klain:</b> I took a different path after graduation and joined a well-known innovative company as a design engineer. In my college years, I won a few design competitions in Singapore. When Alvin shared with me his idea to revolutionize how people carry one of their most intimate items, it stoked my passion to improve lives through innovative designs.</p>

We’ve spent the last 12 months defining the software and hardware requirements as well as building fully functional prototypes. We need your help to keep on going with the development of the final app, the cloud intelligence and to manufacture the first range of the Parce One. The more help you’re able to invest in us, the more units we can build, lowering costs on manufacturing and retail price. We’re at the cusp of making a hugely positive impact on wallets around the world, as well as the environment. Every pledge takes us a step closer. Please feel free to contact with any questions you might have. Thanks for all your incredible support. Say hello on Facebook and Twitter!",35.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2>What is a Wallet TrackR?</h2>
<p><span>The Wallet TrackR fits easily into any wallet - just like a credit card. When combined with the free Wallet TrackR iPhone app, it becomes a powerful new tool to keep you from losing your wallet. When the Wallet TrackR gets separated from your iPhone or iPad, the Wallet TrackR app gently alerts you that you may be leaving your wallet behind.</span><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://phonehalo.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Item_TrackR_with_Device.png"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><span>The app also takes a GPS snapshot of where your wallet was at the moment of separation in case you didn't hear the alert. Tap a button within the app to make your wallet ""ring"" in case your looking for it around the house or in the dark. The technology works both ways, which means your wallet can beep to alert you that you're leaving your phone behind. Works with your iPhone 4S, iPhone 5, new iPad, iPad mini and the new iPod Touch.</span></p>

We have a color for everyone and every situation.We’re tired of being told what to wear; you should feel free to wear whatever you like. All our models are designed for everyone, for all those who feel identified with them, whether you’re a man or a woman. Our first sneakers model is the UX68. We named them after the number of our return flight from the trip where we were inspired with the idea, which we will always remember. When we found out that millions of animals are used by the fashion industry every year, we had just one goal in mind: to create cruelty-free fashion.At BEFLAMBOYANT we feel a strong commitment to be another voice for change in the fashion industry. These days, we can buy all kind of things without thinking about what materials they are made of or if they might be harmful due to their materials or how they are produced. It’s very important to pay attention to what we are buying in the fashion industry because these materials will be in frequent contact with our skin. That’s why we have chosen our materials carefully for you. For us, transparency is fundamental. That’s why we want to tell you all about ourselves. The upper and lining are made of high-quality OEKO TEX and V LABEL certified microfiber.   The inner lining is produced with zero CO2 emissions and free from chromium VI, a commonly-used chemical in the footwear industry that is considered a carcinogen and can be harmful to the skin. The shoe laces are 100% cotton, phthalates-free (a chemical found in many clothing items).The sides are 50% recycled cotton, 25% virgin, and 25% organic, Global Recycled Standard “GRS” certified. The removable insole is 100% recycled PU and the sole is thermoplastic rubber, a 100% recyclable material.   The planet is close to reaching the point of no return. Several countries have declared an environmental state of emergency. It is time to take action.To contribute to the fight against this disaster, we collaborate with the organization One Tree Planted to reforest areas destroyed by the wildfires in California, which has been ravaged by fire over the past few years.Together, we will plant a tree for each pair of shoes sold. We will plant them in the areas most affected by the wildfires, where they are truly needed to return the area to its former splendor. To make this possible we have created the BEFLAMBOYANT project on their website.For each pair of sneakers sold, we will add money to our project. When OneTreePlanted goes out on one of their periodic tree planting trips to California, we will donate the accumulated funds, one tree for each pair of sneakers.You can visit our project here. In addition to buying our sneakers, feel free to donate a little extra to our project directly via the link. We are all now aware of the current world-wide plastic problem. We want to help reduce the senseless spread of plastic by embracing a zero-waste philosophy. You won’t have to throw anything in the trash! We send your sneakers in a natural jute bag which can be re-used every day, together with a plantable seed thank you card so you can create new life thanks to your purchase. To keep your BEFLAMBOYANTs from being damaged during transport, all of this arrives in a cardboard box which you can reuse or recycle in any paper or cardboard receptacle.No more plastic! Your BEFLAMBOYANTs are made in Felgueiras, Portugal, a small town in the Northern part of Portugal whose main industry is footwear.After a thorough search we found a factory motivated to be a part of our project, with excellent artisans with many years of experience working under fair labor conditions and following high manufacturing standards, we have been able to verify all this on our visits.Thank you Sara, thank you Jovan Shoes.    Composition: 100% cotton, plain knit, 165 g/m2 According to the law, it may be a variation of a +/- 5% in the size of the garment.* This project has taken over our lives for almost a year. It has been a difficult road, finding partners who share our values, goals, and who want to take a chance on us.

<p>Through years of research we observed that even those who have severe speech impairment produce distinctive sounds when they laugh, cry, and vocalize emotions and intentions. Their vocalizations contain the voice’s source -- its pitch, tone, rhythm, and loudness. What these individuals lack is the ability to manipulate their tongue, lips, and the shape of their mouth -- their vocal filter. The filter is essential to producing clearly articulated speech. So we developed technology to harness the source characteristics of recipients and supplement them with the vocal filters available to healthy talkers. The result is a blended voice that is as understandable as the donor while conveying the vocal identity of the recipient.<br/></p>

<p>VocaliD's technology can also be used to preserve and reconstruct a voice when needed. Think of it as insurance against a day when a voice is lost or unavailable for whatever reason. Perhaps a teacher suffering from throat cancer, a lawyer who is losing his voice to ALS, or even a young father, deployed overseas, who would love to read his two year old his newest bedtime story in his own voice.</p>
<p>Whether you are taking control of your vocal destiny by banking your voice for yourself or you are sharing the gift of voice with someone in need, our Human Voicebank recording platform will guide you through the process. </p>

<b><h3></h3></b><p>Back in 2002, VocaliD's founder Professor Rupal Patel noticed two people with speech impairment communicating through their assistive technologies. One was a little girl and the other a grown man. They used different devices but the same adult voice. She knew then that something had to be done to change that. </p>
<p>Several years later, Rupal and her research team were able to apply their findings on the residual melodic abilities of those with speech impairments toward the design of personalized voice blending technology. She founded VocaliD in 2014 to bring this innovation out of lab and into the hands of millions of users. </p>
<p>Rupal is joined by a team of scientists, software developers, strategists, entrepreneurs, business development experts, and a cadre of volunteers, parents, and advocates who are equally committed to the vision of empowering lives through technological innovations. <br/></p>

<p><b>How is a VocaliD™ voice different from other commercially available computerized voices?</b></p>
<p>Only VocaliD produces custom voices. These voices are unique because they harness the recipient’s own vocalizations, which are blended with speech from a matched donor.</p>
<p><b>Is a custom voice really that important? </b></p>
<p>Speaking in one’s own voice is not a luxury; it’s a fundamental right. A voice is more than a physical signal; it is a reflection of who you are, your habits, your cultural heritage, whether you use your natural speaking voice or you rely on assistive technology.</p>
<p><b>My child uses an assistive communication device/app. How can I get her a personalized VocaliD voice and when will she have it?</b></p>
<p>Pre-order a VocaliD™ voice through this campaign at a significant discount. Pre-orders will be filled on a first-ordered, first-received basis beginning late 2016. Pre-ordering shows that there is demand for VocaliD™ voices, which we need to demonstrate in order to attract investors without whom we will be unable to bring this innovation to market. </p>
<p>If you need more time to decide but are still interested, show your support by signing up on our website. Please note that pre-orders will be filled prior to contacting those on the waitlist.  </p>
<p><b>My family's ability to pay for a voice is limited. How can we get our loved one a VocaliD™ voice?</b></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>Our goal to create a product that is accessible to all regardless of their financial means.</span></p>While prosthetic voices are not covered by insurance, many of our pre-order clients have used crowdfunding approaches, which serve to both bring communities together in support of an individual and raise awareness, and also to raise the funds necessary to build a custom VocaliD voice. One platform that many have used is Indiegogo Life. </div>
<div> 
<p><b>I have been told by my doctor that I have a condition in which I am or will lose my voice. Can VocaliD help me?</b></p>
<p>Absolutely. You can bank your voice through the Human Voicebank web platform. We will use these recordings to build you your own computerized voice so that you can continue to be heard through your own voice.</p>
<p>Because this is a more straightforward process than voice blending, we can deliver your voice to you before VocaliD™ voices become widely available. And you can take back control of your vocal destiny by banking your voice today.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>What is the Human Voicebank Initiative?</b></p>
<p>To minimize the cost and fulfill our commitment to making VocaliD voices available to all who need and want it, we rely on speech donations to the Human Voicebank to create uniquely blended custom voices. In just a few months, over 8,000 people --children and adults, male and female, from widely varying geographies and ethnicities -- have donated their speech. And thousands more have pledged their commitment to share the gift of voice.</p>
<p><b>Who can donate speech to VocaliD's Human Voicebank?</b></p>
<p>Our recipients are of all ages, sizes and cultural and linguistic backgrounds, so we need donors to reflect this same diversity. English speakers of any age or gender can participate. Accents are welcome and needed. We aim to capture the full texture and variety of the human voice. So if you can speak, you can contribute. Add your voice to the rich and complex tapestry of voices that we are weaving.</p>
<p><b>How are donor recordings used?</b></p>
<p>Each donation is matched with a recipient based on age, gender, language, and cultural background and voice characteristics. The donated voice is then blended with a recipient’s vocalizations to create a unique vocal persona. Donor voices are always blended unless they are for the donor themselves.</p>
<p><b>How can I donate my speech?</b></p>
<p>Login to our virtual recording studio to begin banking your voice. You will need a high-quality headset microphone, a quiet room and a computer running Google Chrome. You can also participate in a school or organization’s Voice Drive. Either way, you’ll spend about four or five hours (broken up into 20 minute or half-hour sessions) speaking a series of sentences that together capture all of the spoken sounds needed to build a computerized voice.</p>
<br/>
<p><b>Which assistive technology devices are compatible with VocaliD™ voices?</b></p>
<p>Whether you use an existing AAC device or consumer application, VocaliD™ voices will be available on all platforms -- including Windows, iOS and android. We have established relationships with a number of the assistive communication device manufacturers (e.g. Tobii/Dynavox, Prentke-Romich Corporation, Lingraphica, etc) and are continuing to forge others. We are also developing our own ""type and talk in your own voice"" application for those who do not have an existing AAC system. If you have further questions please contact us at orders@vocaliD.co.</p>
<p><b>
</b></p>
<p><b>What does the VocaliD subscription fee cover, and how much does it cost?</b></p>
<p>The VocaliD subscription fee provides updates and improvements to meet your needs and to keep pace with technology improvements. The subscription is always free for the first six months, then renews each year on the recipient's birthday. The cost is approximately $240 per year, allowing for some variation depending on the assistive technology device with which it’s used.</p>
<p><b>Are VocaliD Voices offered in other languages?</b></p>
<p>No, not at this time. We are first focusing on English voices but hope to expand to other languages in the future. Since our donors are from all corners of the world, however, our English voices do capture the range of accents worldwide.</p>

<p></p>
<p>NOTE: TRAILBLAZER VOICES ARE SOLD OUT. The Trailblazer program is the culmination of our research and development, aimed at refining our voice creation process and integrating it with existing assistive technologies. More resources, more time, and more individual attention are assigned to these recipients, making this first set of voices far more expensive to produce than the other pre-orders. The seven Trailblazers will receive their custom VocaliD™ voices by December 2015 -- up to a full year earlier than the other pre-order voices.  </p>

</div></div>","50 voices were ordered during the Active Indiegogo campaign including our seven early access VocaliD Trailblazers. 


We're making another 50 voices available for pre-order now, during the InDemand phase of the campaign.

Each one of us has a unique voiceprint. Yet, until now, millions of people who rely on computerized speech to communicate have been given uniform voices. Voices that don’t fit their bodies or their personalities. We wouldn’t dream of fitting a little girl with the prosthetic limb of a grown man, so, why then the same prosthetic voice?Tens of millions worldwide rely on a limited set of generic, synthetic voices. Their vocal ability may have been limited due to autism, cerebral palsy, genetic conditions, stroke, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), brain injury, or head and/or neck cancer. Whatever the cause, they share the desire to work, play, learn, and build relationships speaking as themselves, through their own voice.Thanks to our successful IndieGoGo campaign we will be creating 7 Trailblazer voices in 2015.  Your contributions while In Demand bring VocaliD™ voices to market by late 2016.






























Through years of research we observed that even those who have severe speech impairment produce distinctive sounds when they laugh, cry, and vocalize emotions and intentions. Their vocalizations contain the voice’s source -- its pitch, tone, rhythm, and loudness. What these individuals lack is the ability to manipulate their tongue, lips, and the shape of their mouth -- their vocal filter. The filter is essential to producing clearly articulated speech. So we developed technology to harness the source characteristics of recipients and supplement them with the vocal filters available to healthy talkers. The result is a blended voice that is as understandable as the donor while conveying the vocal identity of the recipient.












In other words, even a single vowel contains enough ""vocal DNA"" to seed the personalization process. VocaliD's custom voices are not mere replicas of the recorded samples. They are original creations that fit and honor the recipient -- bringing attention to her words and her voice.









Every contribution moves us closer to our goal of bringing VocaliD™ voices to market by 2016. We'll thank you with a great perk!

























Listen to the stories of our beta users. Hear them speak -- through their own voices -- about the difference that VocaliD technology makes in their lives.  



It is not only recipients who feel the impact of a VocaliD™ voice. Family, friends, teachers, colleagues, and caregivers all benefit: 

a special education teacher can now differentiate among her students -- not only by their words but also through their voices;

parents delight in hearing their child speak for the first time in a voice they recognize as their child’s own; 
a teenager is empowered to build friendships and engage independently when friends, teachers, and coaches hear her as herself; 
a job candidate speaking through his own voice connects more easily with a potential employer, helping defy the odds for unemployment among those with disabilities.







VocaliD's technology can also be used to preserve and reconstruct a voice when needed. Think of it as insurance against a day when a voice is lost or unavailable for whatever reason. Perhaps a teacher suffering from throat cancer, a lawyer who is losing his voice to ALS, or even a young father, deployed overseas, who would love to read his two year old his newest bedtime story in his own voice.
Whether you are taking control of your vocal destiny by banking your voice for yourself or you are sharing the gift of voice with someone in need, our Human Voicebank recording platform will guide you through the process. 




Linda's VoiceMail Story:








Back in 2002, VocaliD's founder Professor Rupal Patel noticed two people with speech impairment communicating through their assistive technologies. One was a little girl and the other a grown man. They used different devices but the same adult voice. She knew then that something had to be done to change that. 
Several years later, Rupal and her research team were able to apply their findings on the residual melodic abilities of those with speech impairments toward the design of personalized voice blending technology. She founded VocaliD in 2014 to bring this innovation out of lab and into the hands of millions of users. 
Rupal is joined by a team of scientists, software developers, strategists, entrepreneurs, business development experts, and a cadre of volunteers, parents, and advocates who are equally committed to the vision of empowering lives through technological innovations. 



















How is a VocaliD™ voice different from other commercially available computerized voices?
Only VocaliD produces custom voices. These voices are unique because they harness the recipient’s own vocalizations, which are blended with speech from a matched donor.
Is a custom voice really that important? 
Speaking in one’s own voice is not a luxury; it’s a fundamental right. A voice is more than a physical signal; it is a reflection of who you are, your habits, your cultural heritage, whether you use your natural speaking voice or you rely on assistive technology.
My child uses an assistive communication device/app. How can I get her a personalized VocaliD voice and when will she have it?
Pre-order a VocaliD™ voice through this campaign at a significant discount. Pre-orders will be filled on a first-ordered, first-received basis beginning late 2016. Pre-ordering shows that there is demand for VocaliD™ voices, which we need to demonstrate in order to attract investors without whom we will be unable to bring this innovation to market. 
If you need more time to decide but are still interested, show your support by signing up on our website. Please note that pre-orders will be filled prior to contacting those on the waitlist.  
My family's ability to pay for a voice is limited. How can we get our loved one a VocaliD™ voice?

Our goal to create a product that is accessible to all regardless of their financial means.While prosthetic voices are not covered by insurance, many of our pre-order clients have used crowdfunding approaches, which serve to both bring communities together in support of an individual and raise awareness, and also to raise the funds necessary to build a custom VocaliD voice. One platform that many have used is Indiegogo Life. 
 
I have been told by my doctor that I have a condition in which I am or will lose my voice. Can VocaliD help me?
Absolutely. You can bank your voice through the Human Voicebank web platform. We will use these recordings to build you your own computerized voice so that you can continue to be heard through your own voice.
Because this is a more straightforward process than voice blending, we can deliver your voice to you before VocaliD™ voices become widely available. And you can take back control of your vocal destiny by banking your voice today.

What is the Human Voicebank Initiative?
To minimize the cost and fulfill our commitment to making VocaliD voices available to all who need and want it, we rely on speech donations to the Human Voicebank to create uniquely blended custom voices. In just a few months, over 8,000 people --children and adults, male and female, from widely varying geographies and ethnicities -- have donated their speech. And thousands more have pledged their commitment to share the gift of voice.
Who can donate speech to VocaliD's Human Voicebank?
Our recipients are of all ages, sizes and cultural and linguistic backgrounds, so we need donors to reflect this same diversity. English speakers of any age or gender can participate. Accents are welcome and needed. We aim to capture the full texture and variety of the human voice. So if you can speak, you can contribute. Add your voice to the rich and complex tapestry of voices that we are weaving.
How are donor recordings used?
Each donation is matched with a recipient based on age, gender, language, and cultural background and voice characteristics. The donated voice is then blended with a recipient’s vocalizations to create a unique vocal persona. Donor voices are always blended unless they are for the donor themselves.
How can I donate my speech?
Login to our virtual recording studio to begin banking your voice. You will need a high-quality headset microphone, a quiet room and a computer running Google Chrome. You can also participate in a school or organization’s Voice Drive. Either way, you’ll spend about four or five hours (broken up into 20 minute or half-hour sessions) speaking a series of sentences that together capture all of the spoken sounds needed to build a computerized voice.

Which assistive technology devices are compatible with VocaliD™ voices?
Whether you use an existing AAC device or consumer application, VocaliD™ voices will be available on all platforms -- including Windows, iOS and android. We have established relationships with a number of the assistive communication device manufacturers (e.g. Tobii/Dynavox, Prentke-Romich Corporation, Lingraphica, etc) and are continuing to forge others. We are also developing our own ""type and talk in your own voice"" application for those who do not have an existing AAC system. If you have further questions please contact us at orders@vocaliD.co.


What does the VocaliD subscription fee cover, and how much does it cost?
The VocaliD subscription fee provides updates and improvements to meet your needs and to keep pace with technology improvements. The subscription is always free for the first six months, then renews each year on the recipient's birthday. The cost is approximately $240 per year, allowing for some variation depending on the assistive technology device with which it’s used.
Are VocaliD Voices offered in other languages?
No, not at this time. We are first focusing on English voices but hope to expand to other languages in the future. Since our donors are from all corners of the world, however, our English voices do capture the range of accents worldwide.
What part do Trailblazers play and why are Trailblazer voices more expensive than other pre-order voices?

NOTE: TRAILBLAZER VOICES ARE SOLD OUT. The Trailblazer program is the culmination of our research and development, aimed at refining our voice creation process and integrating it with existing assistive technologies. More resources, more time, and more individual attention are assigned to these recipients, making this first set of voices far more expensive to produce than the other pre-orders. The seven Trailblazers will receive their custom VocaliD™ voices by December 2015 -- up to a full year earlier than the other pre-order voices.  
I get it -- personalized computer voices can profoundly change lives. How can I help make sure that this product successfully comes to market by the end of 2016?

We're <b>Eduardo Burgueno</b> and <b>Benjamin Jensen</b>, inventors of Disc-Traction. We both suffer from back pain, but couldn’t seem to find any convenient solution that would help.

<p>Eduardo here - Ben and I are very passionate in our work. We use Disc-Traction every day, and so do our close friends and family. After trying so many products that promised to fix our back pain, we knew it was time to take matters into our own hands. Disc-Traction works. Disc-Traction has improved our lives and has kept us nearly pain free for years. We want to spread the love to all of you, and we hope you'll share Disc-Traction with those you care about. So please, donate to our campaign. Your donations will help us to create more inventory and reach more people around the world. Hopefully you can buy a belt for yourself. If you can't, that's okay; support us in any way you can, whether it be $1 or a Facebook share. If you can donate a little more and you choose to get a Disc-Traction belt for your whole family, know that our family is so excited to help you start this journey. </p>

</div></div>","Our StoryHello! We're Eduardo Burgueno and Benjamin Jensen, inventors of Disc-Traction. We both suffer from back pain, but couldn’t seem to find any convenient solution that would help. Current traction devices didn’t help to alleviate our back pain, so we decided to take matters into our own hands. We invented Disc-Traction as a more effective way to relieve back pain.
Our design offers an improved alternative to static traction
devices because it enables the user to control the level of force. It features
a therapeutic exercise belt with two nylon handles that can be pressed to
decompress and relieve pressure on the spine. For convenient back pain
relief, simply secure the Disc-Traction belt around the waist and press down on
the handles while performing the included isometric exercises. Your pledges and
donations will help to fund inventory production costs as well as publicity and
marketing efforts for the ultimate back pain reliever - Disc-Traction!
Our Goal: To help relieve lumbar back pain and sciatica 
Back pain is one of the most prevalent problems affecting adults. But just how wide-spread is it? Let's take a look at some statistics provided by the American Chiropractic Association:
Low back pain is the single leading cause of disability worldwide.
Experts estimate that as many as 80% of the population will experience back problems at some point in their lives.
Back pain is one of the most common reasons for missed work and the second most common reason for visits to the doctor's office.
Americans spend at least $50 billion each year on back pain.
Through disc decompression, Disc-Traction can help to relieve lumbar back pain and sciatica. As you can see, back pain is a prevalent and costly problem. Disc-Traction is a low-cost preventative measure that is simple, convenient, and inexpensive. How It Works:


A velcro strap allows you to quickly and comfortably secure Disc-Traction to fit your size.
By pushing down on the handles, Disc-Traction relieves lumbar back pain and sciatica through disc decompression.
Durable materials with double stitching make this belt high-quality and long-lasting.
Performing the recommended isometric exercises strengthens and rehabilitates the muscles and joints, as well as encourages correct posture and alignment.
Exercises facilitate muscle relaxation and blood circulation.
Disc-Traction can be used standing, sitting, or laying down.You can perform the exercises daily or on an as-needed basis. Applying this type of force while standing, walking, and/or exercising is really what sets the Disc-Traction Belt apart from all other decompression devices.A simple design allows you to focus on what matters most – back pain relief.The Disc-Traction material is thin and can fold or roll for optimal portability so you can take it on-the-go. Don't get caught without it!

Testimonials:
Read what Disc-Traction users have to say about our product.
“As a physical therapist specializing in the care of the spine for the past 31 years, I find the Disc-Traction belt to be an essential tool in my kit. It is especially helpful in the care of older or elderly patients who can’t tolerate pain at the knee or hip joints. I have a couple of the most popular sizes in stock so I have them at the ready.” –Ellen, Physical Therapist, Wausau, WI
“The very first time I saw Disc-Traction Therapeutic Exercise Belt, I realized the potential use in the treatment of my patients with low back problems. I believe the belt can be an essential tool for people needing help in relieving pain and discomfort.” -Douglas Hibbard, D.C.

I'm doing this Indiegogo campaign to help raise money so I can order shirts, tank tops, and finally women's shirts and hoodies. 



(For Hoodies and Women's shirts also!! All designs are double sided)


ASTRO:
CHIEF:

COSMONAUT:

DRAGON:

GLASS:

JUNGLE:

NAUTILUS:

PANDORA:

Risks and challenges:
I've been designing and selling sublimation shirts for about year now and have hundreds of happy customers around the world.

<h3>Nipple Chafing</h3>
<p>Want to set a resolution you know you can achieve? Then resolve to never let your nips chafe again! Every male distance runner knows what we are talking about. Whether you are new to the sport or run everyday; you have had that awkward moment in the run where your nips sting more than your lungs. It sucks! Thankfully, NipStrips is doing something about it.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>How We Got Started:</b></p>
<p>After experiencing this awful dilemma firsthand, we set out testing many of the products on the market that claim to prevent it. We were dissatisfied with what we found. So we decided to carry the weight of the nipple chafing world on our backs and find a better solution. We tested scores of products and finally landed on a product that was invisible, non-staining, affordable, and tough enough to handle the miles. We have the prototype and now we want to start a nipple revolution. Want to help? You should help!</p>
<p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get:</b></p>
<p>No revolution comes without a price. We have created our prototype but we need your help to cover the costs for the adhesive, manufacturing and packaging. We need to raise about $5,000.00 to cover our initial order.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>We know your desire to end nipple chafing is what really compels you to give, BUT we would like to recognize your contribution in the following ways:</p>

<h3>I have developed and patented a true answer to the long term problem of head/neck drooping that occurs when a child falls asleep in an upright position, it is called NECK CORRECT. I realized the need for NECK CORRECT after observing the symptoms associated from nerve irritation that occurs when the neck is compressed, such as when a child falls asleep in an upright position. These children present with symptoms of chronic sore throats, neck pain, ear aches, headaches and irritability, to name a few.  Beyond those annoying symptoms, a very serious condition could develop, if left untreated and uncorrected, which is SCOLIOSIS of the spine. When a child's head droops to one side, the body compensates and shifts the hips to the opposite side, thus forming an ""S"" shape to the spine.  Did you know that 70% of American school age children have some form of scoliosis? The majority of these children spent a lot of time in a car seat or stroller, sleeping upright, no doubt.The long term financial effects of SCOLIOSIS places a huge unnecessary burden on our society, let alone the physical and health effects, when it could have been avoided from the start! For a more detailed explanation, of these statements, please go to YOU TUBE: no sko/neck correct, to see the infomercial I had developed and produced.</h3>
<p>Another benefit to backing my project is that I am having it ""Made in the USA"".  Though this decision to have NECK CORRECT Made in the USA is more expensive than overseas, creating and keeping jobs in the USA is just as important to me, as is healthy, happy kids with straight spines.</p>
<p>To date I have invested many thousands of dollars to get NECK CORRECT patented, prototype developed, test group studied, domain name protected, web development, infomercial produced, licensed, and insured, as well as payment of Accounting and Legal fees.  The money we raise will go to the following:</p>
<p>$15,000. for product liability insurance.</p>
<p>$25,000. Minimum order cost requirements and shipping costs.</p>
<p>$10,000. Legal and Accounting costs Indiegogo fees.</p>
<p>Please be a part of this great project.  NECK CORRECT is the true answer to preventing the inevitable, unhealthy and mostly unnecessary head drooping when a child falls asleep while sitting up. We look forward to having a NECK CORRECT in every car seat, stroller and child carrier in the world. But only if you pledge. Your pledges won't go unrewarded,  take a look at the reward levels and see what appeals to you.  PLEASE KEEP IN MIND, Indiegogo will not release funds if the project is underfunded, but they will release funds if they are 100% or better. Thank you in advance for helping the children of the world and fulfilling my dream, Chris Connolly DC</p>

While many of us live comfortable lives, almost half the world survives on less than $2.50 a day. There are people facing real problems - poverty, cancer, aids, lack of shelter, lack of water.  Each of us can make an impact. When we all join together, we can change the world.</p>

<p class=""p5"">Just email us - <span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong><a href=""mailto:hi@1facewatch.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">hi@1facewatch.com</a></strong></span>.</p>
<p class=""p5""><strong>When will my watch be delivered?</strong></p>
<p class=""p5"">Shipping Date: 11.20.2012.</p>
<p class=""p5"">We know you want to show off your watch, so we are working hard to get them manufactured and ready to ship as soon as possible. We refuse to send you anything but the highest quality product!</p>
<p class=""p5""><strong>Will the screen crack?</strong></p>
<p class=""p5"">The screen is made out of tempered glass and will not crack unless there is a VERY heavy impact. If it does crack, let us know and we will either fix it or replace it. </p>
<p class=""p5""><strong>Is there a warranty for the 1:Face watch?</strong></p>
<p class=""p5"">Yes. There is a 1-year warranty. If there are any defects, our repair center will fix it or replace it. However, we strive to provide the highest quality materials so this will not be an issue.</p>
<p class=""p5""><strong>How long does the battery last?</strong></p>
<p class=""p5"">The watch is battery-powered. The battery life depends on how often you check the time, but if you check about 6 times per day, it should last around 2 years.</p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><strong>Can the battery be changed?</strong></span></p>
<p class=""p1"">You can definitely replace the battery.  Take it to any watch repair shop in your city and they'll be able to do it for you easily.</p>
<p class=""p12""><strong>Is the watch waterproof?</strong></p>
<p class=""p12"">YES </p>
<p class=""p5""><strong>Are the watches available in retail stores?</strong></p>
<p class=""p5"">Not yet, but soon! 1:Face will be in retail stores in 2013. </p>
<p class=""p5""><strong>What is the Universal Touchscreen watch?</strong></p>
<p class=""p5"">The universal watch is a touchscreen version of the 1:Face watch that, when purchased, fulfills every metric. The watch does not have any buttons, but displays the time when the face of the watch is touched by the user.  </p>
</div>
<div class=""1face_content"">
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><strong>What percentage of donations go to the charities?</strong></span></p>
<p class=""p1"">Each watch comes with a metric which is carried out with the purchase of the watch.  We want to make the business model as transparent as possible and never want you to have to ask the question ""And then what?""  With that said we will not only tell you what, we will show you what!</p>
<p class=""p1"">For example, for every white watch purchased, One Day's Wages will provide 16 children in the Horn of Africa with food supplements.  The same holds true for each of the other metrics. The goal is to create an actual quantified change in people's lives around the world for each watch sold.</p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><strong>Where are the watches manufactured?</strong></span></p>
<p class=""p1"">The watches are designed at the Mirza Minds headquarters in Chicago, IL &amp; assembled in Shenzhen, China. The facility has passed the SA8000 (Social Accountability) and ISO14000 (Environmental) audits. Furthermore, our manufacturing facility is ROHS compliant.  </p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><strong>How do the watches work?  What functions do they provide?</strong></span></p>
<p class=""p1"">The watch has a minimalist design, both visually and functionally.  The fundamental purpose of a watch is to display the time, and with its large LED display, that is what the 1:Face watch does.  At the press of a second button, it can also display the current date.  <span class=""s1"">T</span>he mirror face of the watch is a reminder that you are change.  </p>
<p class=""p1"">Setting and modifying the time and date is as easy as pressing one button to enter ""EDIT"" mode and another button to change the selected value. Full instructions will be included when the product is shipped. </p>
<p class=""p5""><strong>Is there a charge for International Shipping?</strong></p>
<p class=""p5"">Yes, there will need to be an additional charge to ship internationally. It costs $15 per watch to ship to international addresses.  If you buy a 3-watch half-set ($120 perk), international shipping is $25. For a 6-watch full-set ($240 perk or any perk levels higher), international shipping is $40.  Please include that in the checkout price.  If you forget, we'll contact you prior to shipping to finalize those details.</p>

1:FACE WATCH 
Changing the World 1:Face at a Time

                         

Campaign Update:

Social Impact Goals - Progress To Date:
Support for the 1:Face movement has been incredible! Thank you all! The stories you are sharing and the changes you are creating are a real source of inspiration. Because we believe so strongly in these causes and in YOU, the face of this movement, we have set ambitious goals for us to achieve. It won't be easy, but together we will change the world!
NEW PERK ($200) - Get the Universal Touchscreen watch!
The universal watch is a touchscreen version of the 1:Face watch that fulfills all metrics. That means you are supporting every cause! The watch has no buttons, instead displaying the time when you touch the mirrored face. The alloy metal frame is the same material used in the iPhone frame. 

The 1:Face Watch empowers YOU to create change in the World.
How: Each color watch represents a different cause and has a particular metric tied to it. When you buy a watch, this metric is carried out by our supporting charities. 
For example, when you buy 1 white watch, our supporting charity One Day's Wages provides food supplements to 16 children in the Horn of Africa.   



 
Look Good.  Do Good.
The 1:Face watch is a fashion product with much more than fashion value. Create change in the World while looking good & feeling good! 
 
 



 
How it works 
Each color watch is paired with a cause, a charity, and a specific metric. For each watch you purchase, the charity tied to that cause will fulfill that specific metric. YOU are creating the change in the World! Through our website and social media, we will be highlighting stories of the change being created. YOU will literally be able to see the change YOU have created. 

 HUNGER: White - One Day's Wages

The horn of Africa (Ethiopia, Kenya, and Somalia) has recently experienced its worst drought in 60 years, leaving 13 million people in need of assistance and food. Along with their long term work in the region, for every white watch purchased, One Day's Wages will be able to provide treatment for 16 malnourished children with food supplements they desperately need.
 
WATER: Yellow - Charity: Water

30,000 people die every week from unsafe drinking water. For every 625 water watches purchased, Charity: Water will build a well, providing sanitary drinking water for an entire village.
 
 BREAST CANCER: Pink - National Breast Cancer Foundation

1 in every 8 woman will develop breast cancer in their lifetime. A simple mammogram can help save these woman's lives.  However, millions of women don't have the money to pay for this procedure. Every 14 pink watches purchased will enable the National Breast Cancer Foundation to provide 1 mammogram for a woman in need.
 
ENVIRONMENT: Blue - The Adventure Project

Everyday, 3 billion people in developing countries are exposed to toxic smoke when preparing meals.  The Adventure Project will provide 1 charcoal efficient stove to a family in Haiti for every 3 blue watches purchased.
 
AIDS: Red - Keep a Child Alive

Over 30 million people live with AIDS worldwide. For every 5 red watches purchased, Keep a Child Alive can provide the AIDS care necessary to keep a child alive with AIDS alive for one month.
 
CANCER: Black - American Cancer Society

Millions of people are affected by cancer each year. Many of them aren't educated about the treatment options available and even more struggle with the emotional impact this causes on them and their family. To help these people, for every black watch purchased, the American Cancer Society can provide the necessary education and support to 8 cancer patients and their families.
 

Our Story - The Beginning 
This project began its life at Mirza Minds, a product and branding firm in Chicago. The watch brand was originally the vision of Creative Director Fam Mirza. Having experienced both the hardships of the 3rd world and the comfort of the 1st, Fam desired to create something that could bridge that gap and ultimately make the world a better place.
""Change originates from within. That is why the face of the watch is designed as a mirror. When you check the time, you see your reflection looking back within you."" -Fam Mirza 
Our vision was not just to create a product, but to start a movement that would bring change to a world that so desperately needs it. While many of us live comfortable lives, almost half the world survives on less than $2.50 a day. There are people facing real problems - poverty, cancer, aids, lack of shelter, lack of water.  Each of us can make an impact. When we all join together, we can change the world.
We have worked tirelessly on this project for the past year, and after finalizing everything from product design, supporting charities, & change metrics the only part left is YOU!
 

1:Face Watch Functional Specs 
The watch has a mirrored face with 4 parallel buttons and is set in a high-grade silicone band. When a button is pressed, the time is displayed with white intensity LED lights. Overall, the watch has a simplistic design that fits any outfit, style, or culture. Everything is symmetrical and has a smooth composition.  The battery lasts for about 2 years and of course the watch is waterproof.



What are we going to do with the money?
EVERY WATCH PURCHASED = WATCH METRIC MET
The rest of the money raised here on Indiegogo will go toward building the 1:Face movement.  The money will fund the first production run & distribution so you can get your watch and start showing it off. Additional money will go toward marketing efforts to expand the movement.
Manufacturing - We know you want your 1:Face watch as soon as possible, so we are already working with our manufacturing factory on production.  We need the money to get this first batch manufactured and shipped.
Distribution - Our mission is to empower consumers to change the world.  As such, we want to make 1:Face as easily available for as many people as possible. To do this, we want to extend our distribution channels through ecommerce and retail outlets such as Macy's, Target, Urban Outfitters etc.

For example, for every white watch purchased, One Day's Wages will provide 16 children in the Horn of Africa with food supplements.  The same holds true for each of the other metrics. The goal is to create an actual quantified change in people's lives around the world for each watch sold.
Where are the watches manufactured?
The watches are designed at the Mirza Minds headquarters in Chicago, IL & assembled in Shenzhen, China. The facility has passed the SA8000 (Social Accountability) and ISO14000 (Environmental) audits. Furthermore, our manufacturing facility is ROHS compliant.  
How do the watches work?  What functions do they provide?
The watch has a minimalist design, both visually and functionally.  The fundamental purpose of a watch is to display the time, and with its large LED display, that is what the 1:Face watch does.  At the press of a second button, it can also display the current date.  The mirror face of the watch is a reminder that you are change.  
Setting and modifying the time and date is as easy as pressing one button to enter ""EDIT"" mode and another button to change the selected value. Full instructions will be included when the product is shipped. 
Is there a charge for International Shipping?
Yes, there will need to be an additional charge to ship internationally. It costs $15 per watch to ship to international addresses.  If you buy a 3-watch half-set ($120 perk), international shipping is $25. For a 6-watch full-set ($240 perk or any perk levels higher), international shipping is $40.  Please include that in the checkout price.  If you forget, we'll contact you prior to shipping to finalize those details.
If you have any specific questions about your location, please email us at hi@1facewatch.com.

<h1>How we are going to do it</h1>
<p>With the help of Horizon Precision Machining we have molded a working version of the Edge Risers which is ready to be used for manufacturing the Edge Risers. Upon success of this campaign, we will first check over the mold and make any changes required to the mold and replace the tools used for molding the part. Then we will be sending out the mold to a mold manufacturer, thus the injection molding cycle begins. We then check over all the molded Edge Risers and make sure everything looks good. After this, we will need to order the correct screws and shipping materials. Finally, we will package up the Edge Risers and ship them out to you!</p>

<h3>About us:</h3>
<p>we are The Premo Workshop, a handmade leather goods company in upstate New York. Our company is run by Me (Mason Premo) and my wife Jackie. We have a beautiful 15 month old boy named Morris and our daughter Elsie that will arrive in August! </p>
<p>We started this journey a few years back and grew it from a part time hobby to a full fledged business that is now our sole source of income. In a few short years we've gone from a couple hundred followers to nearly 20 k on instagram alone. With that said, we have a lot of orders and our wait time is always increasing due to our high demand and not enough hands. Thats where this campaign comes in...</p>
</div><div>
<h3>We need your help!</h3>
<p>This campaign is to raise $6000 to fund a major overhaul of how we run our business. With this money we will purchase not only materials but we will invest in time saving equipment such as a ""clicker press"" which uses die cutters and a hydraulic press to stamp out panels of leather for all our products. This will cut my wait time in half because I won't spend time cutting panels by hand. we will also spend a majority of the money on materials like leather, brass, and packaging materials. This will all help to accomplish a shorter wait period for products and bring it from 4-8 weeks down to just 1-2.</p>
<p>Each pledge of $60 or more will receive The Lovetap Keyhook as their incentive. with the sale of 100 key hooks we hope to accomplish our $6000 goal.</p>

we are The Premo Workshop, a handmade leather goods company in upstate New York. Our company is run by Me (Mason Premo) and my wife Jackie. We have a beautiful 15 month old boy named Morris and our daughter Elsie that will arrive in August! 
We started this journey a few years back and grew it from a part time hobby to a full fledged business that is now our sole source of income. In a few short years we've gone from a couple hundred followers to nearly 20 k on instagram alone. With that said, we have a lot of orders and our wait time is always increasing due to our high demand and not enough hands. Thats where this campaign comes in...

We need your help!
This campaign is to raise $6000 to fund a major overhaul of how we run our business. With this money we will purchase not only materials but we will invest in time saving equipment such as a ""clicker press"" which uses die cutters and a hydraulic press to stamp out panels of leather for all our products. This will cut my wait time in half because I won't spend time cutting panels by hand. we will also spend a majority of the money on materials like leather, brass, and packaging materials. This will all help to accomplish a shorter wait period for products and bring it from 4-8 weeks down to just 1-2.
Each pledge of $60 or more will receive The Lovetap Keyhook as their incentive. with the sale of 100 key hooks we hope to accomplish our $6000 goal.

<p>Three friends bound together by the love of Puros.</p>
<ul>
<li>Yann BOUTEN,  designer, cutler and leather-worker</li>
<li>Gilles BAILLY-MAITRE, skilled smith and cutler</li>
<li>Pierre JOURDAN, project manager and communication specialist</li>
</ul>
<p>The initial idea originated in Pierre's afficionado mind, and was refined by Yann and Gilles through the mastery of their craft. A first prototype was created, and then <b>tested for several months</b>. Happy with the result, we decided to start a company to bring this fantastic accessory to the world.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1443806395/cklzadxvqjfemnepbtin.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Because we strongly believe in <strong>community validated projects</strong>.</p>
<p>We already invested a lot of time and money in perfecting our prototypes, registering trademarks and designs.</p>
<p>Now in order to <strong>produce the accessory on a larger scale </strong>we would need to invest in costly machinery, setup a shared workshop, get some help from specialised accountants and attorneys... and we're confident this great accessory will meet the aficionados community's support. </p>
<p>Prove us we are right, <strong>help us live our dream !</strong></p>

The registered shape of our cigar knife blade allows it to retain a razor sharp cut on the part that cuts the cigar thanks to its inward curve.

Three friends bound together by the love of Puros.

Yann BOUTEN,  designer, cutler and leather-worker
Gilles BAILLY-MAITRE, skilled smith and cutler
Pierre JOURDAN, project manager and communication specialist

The initial idea originated in Pierre's afficionado mind, and was refined by Yann and Gilles through the mastery of their craft. A first prototype was created, and then tested for several months. Happy with the result, we decided to start a company to bring this fantastic accessory to the world.


Because we strongly believe in community validated projects.
We already invested a lot of time and money in perfecting our prototypes, registering trademarks and designs.
Now in order to produce the accessory on a larger scale we would need to invest in costly machinery, setup a shared workshop, get some help from specialised accountants and attorneys... and we're confident this great accessory will meet the aficionados community's support. 
Prove us we are right, help us live our dream !












You don't need to worry about shipping cost since they're included in the perk prices. Wichever perk you chose it will be delivered to your door regardless of where you live at no additional cost.
* Except for the ""Early Bird Essential "" and ""Founders Essential "" perks

<p>There are still challenges in reaching a rock solid system after bringing all the pieces such as the jewelry, software, apps, firmware and the traffic servers all together. Another challenge is keeping up with the demand. It would require literally a city full of craftsmen to handle handcrafting of the pieces. A test process is already in place to try out production prototypes and clean all the hardware and software weaknesses and bugs. If everything goes well in all the hardware, the software and the art; all the gift samples would be shipped by mid November two weeks after the end of the campaign and just before the thanks-giving holiday. All the features have to be extensively characterized and analyzed statistically in detail to reach a robust design.</p>

Diamodo seamlessly blends technology, social networks, and art into a beautifully handcrafted piece with touches form many engineers, craftsman, and artists that make every single one of them a unique piece.

What makes Diamodo special is that it connects you with your loved ones. Whenever you call your loved one, Diamodo will flash to show your care about her.
 
 
Journey of Diamodo
Row rocks from mines in many countries such as India and Tanzania flow into gems headquarter of the world; Bangkok for cutting and polishing.


In another path, silicon chips which are literally made of sand as well find their path to China for microelectronic assembly.

After their smooth merger with the rocks, unique smart gemstones are carried to the ancient parts of the world; mainly to Istanbul and Cairo for jewelry handcrafting. 

Here many local artists with thousands of years back mystic skills handcraft them piece by piece into their final look.



Meanwhile, many accessory pieces such as PCBs, wooden art-boxes are transferred to California. Here, they are locally hand-assembled into a magic jewelry box that can wirelessly charge your Diamodo set.


 How it works?Diamodo is a user friendly product, just download the mobile application and connect your smart phone to the jewelry. 

 
Ring, Bracelet and NecklaceDiamodo comes in many forms; ring, bracelet and necklace. Many distinct models each with its special stone, art and color around serve wide range of tastes and preferences. What makes it distinct from other wearable technologies?
True handcrafting around the technology
Wireless charging capability and water resistant designs
LED based illumination technology with various types and colors of gemstones from distinct corners of the world.
Diamodo comes with a special jewelry box that charges your jewelry when it is just dropped in. FeaturesTechnical Demonstration of DiamodoIn this video, first prototypes of Diamodo are being tested at laboratory. As shown in the video, Bluetooth connection and wireless charging functionality of Diamodo successfully works. Risks & Challenges
There are still challenges in reaching a rock solid system after bringing all the pieces such as the jewelry, software, apps, firmware and the traffic servers all together. Another challenge is keeping up with the demand. It would require literally a city full of craftsmen to handle handcrafting of the pieces. A test process is already in place to try out production prototypes and clean all the hardware and software weaknesses and bugs. If everything goes well in all the hardware, the software and the art; all the gift samples would be shipped by mid November two weeks after the end of the campaign and just before the thanks-giving holiday. All the features have to be extensively characterized and analyzed statistically in detail to reach a robust design.

Carolina Gawron Couture brand was founded in 2012. So far, I’ve successfully developed two pilot collections consisting of more than 20 projects Haute Couture dresses and more than 10 Dresses Ready-to-Wear outfits. Urged by clients and motivated by the enthusiastic feedback from not only clients, but also fashion magazines, star photographers, I feel obliged to deliver a full-blown collection. Thus, I am asking for help with achieving this goal. 

Testimonials of my clients are the most authentic assessment of my work:

""We offer minimalism, and Carolina Gawron offers the imagination""

""Mesmerized! I've been privileged to have Carolina design for me an evening dress and a couple of suits. All outfits are gorgeous, feminine, chick and classy. They empower, so that I can feel and look in charge and control in both social and professional spheres of my life. Looking forward to seeing more of her designs on the red carpet. I am confident she will make it to the very top. Thank you! ""Vision of the Carolina Gawron Couture brand:

- Create the most desired dresses with genuine passion 

All Carolina Gawron Couture outfits are characterized by unique designs that supremely stress and reveal feminity.

<h3>The Beginning of an Ecoventure </h3>
<p> </p>
<div>My humble beginnings began in a fairly populated city in Nigeria. My connection with the environment has always played a big role in my life--- even from a tender age.  Most of my young teenage life was spent outdoors and it wasn't until I left Nigeria that I realized the poor and depleting state of our natural resources. In 2011, I got more hands on with an environmental ethics/research class that I took during my MBA, I was confronted with the grave issues affecting the Niger Delta area due to oil spills dating as far back as the 1930s. Tied in with my Fashion IQ (my father was a buyer and fashion designer), experience as a fashion stylist and producer, I knew that I could use fashion as a vehicle to push the message of sustainability and inspiring ways to positively change our world.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>From my experience and research, there aren't enough sustainable platforms to represent and/or showcase eco-friendly designers in New York City. Most parts of the world have their own ecofashion week that's held annually. The role FASHION plays in our daily lives is very important. We love to dress in the most fashionable gears that our disposable income can afford, drive the most fashionable looking cars, and immerse ourselves in brand association that our society craves for. It begs the question... How are we treating our environment? Why is there ignorance when the conversation of our environment comes up? This is NO longer an issue that can be ignored. Our environment is talking to us... we see the ice caps are melting, air and water pollution have taken its course on many levels that the effects are destructive. You must ask yourself, what can I do to change my environment... this of course can mean your apartment building, neighborhoods, communities, towns, cities, states, country... the WORLD!?</div>
<div> </div>
<div>As the founder of Fashion Envie, this was a passion project that came about due to the lack thereof of Eco-friendly events to support these artists and designers. I was born and partly raised in Nigeria. I was constantly surrounded by one type of pollution or another during those tender years. It wasn't till I moved to the States with my family I realized the dangers we were in; the media back home fails to mention how deteriorated our natural resources are. With this in mind and upon conclusion of my Shell Oil project in 2011, the seed was planted. Fashion can be used as vehicle to promote change and create dialogue about these environmental issues. Hence, the reason for Fashion Envie!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>It seems that the perception of anything that's eco-friendly either smells, has poor quality, and/or lacks value. That argument is beginning to lose ground since high-end designers such as Stella McCartney and Vivienne Westwood have already taken major steps in becoming more eco-conscious with their collection and brand image. So, that should suggest that we are on the path to saving our planet and returning to nature. We hope that through Fashion Envie, we can infuse F.U.N (Fashion Understanding Nature) into the fashion industry and rebrand the concept of eco-design (art, fashion, interior home design etc).</div>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Fashion Envie Cost Breakdown</h3>
<p>From my professional experience, to produce an event of this magnitude usually requires a fixed budget of $10,000. However, we are looking for ways to curb our expenses while remaining Eco-friendly in our approach. For instance, to <em>green</em> print event programs, purchase Eco-friendly gift bags, and other production materials will cost an estimate of $2,000. This is where we need the most financial assistance. </p>
<p>-By supporting Fashion Envie, you will be investing in the designer's future in a tremendous way!</p>
<p>-Add value in terms of production and presentation.</p>
<p>-Most Eco-friendly projects lack originality and creativity. However, Fashion Envie will showcase inspiring and F.U.N (Fashion Understanding Nature), highlighted by a creative aesthetic that will appeal to our guests.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>-Fashion Envie's goal is to <strong>rebrand</strong> the concept of <em>Eco-friendly </em>as an essential need for our environment.</p>
<p>-By aligning our mission with  Skraptacular--a nonprofit organization based in New Yirk City, we will inspire the younger generation to transform their environment for the future. Please visit <a href=""http://www.skraptacular.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.skraptacular.org</a> to learn more.</p>

<p>Paper Clouds Apparel is a shirt company with a conscience. We take artwork created by special needs individuals and put that art on Earth friendly super soft bamboo shirts. We then donate <strong>50%</strong> of the profit from the sale of the shirt back to the school/organization that created the art. For the past two years we have been teamed up with VALLEYLIFE, located in Phoenix, AZ. VALLEYLIFE is the oldest habilitation center in Arizona and helps over 450 special needs individuals valley wide. Our ultimate goal at Paper Clouds Apparel has always been to help special needs schools and organizations in all 50 states ! This is where you can help us</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Why Paper Clouds Apparel needs your help-</strong></p>
<p>The funding we raise on Indiegogo will be used to cover the production and expansion of Paper Clouds Apparel. We have teamed up with Autism Speaks, the nation's largest autism science and advocacy organization, and a new group of special needs schools. We will be creating and selling shirts from a different school/organization every week. There will be two pieces of art selected each week: one men's and one women's design. For the men's shirts, the art will be on three different colored crew neck or v-neck bamboo shirts. Women can chose from a v-neck shirt, tank top, or a spaghetti strap camisole top, also made from bamboo. The next line will use plant and soy based screen printing chemical products and water based inks. We set our goal at <strong>$20,000 </strong>however we hope to exceed our goal to aid our expansion. The more we raise the more schools we can help fund. Our Indiegogo funding will go to the construction of an updated website, the hiring of graphic designers to turn the art into vector form so screens can be made. We would love to raise enough to order the next line of shirts in a large bulk quantity, thus lowering the overhead. We also would like to raise enough to purchase our own screen printing press and screens. This would mean no longer having to outsource this process. Both of these steps would lower the cost of making the shirts, thus making the profit larger and more money we could donate back to the special needs schools/organizations.</p>
<p><strong>Why The Special Needs Schools/Organizations Need Our Help ?</strong></p>
<p>Most special needs schools are privately run, non-profit organizations that rely on government funding and private donations to keep their doors open. Government funding to special needs schools has been drastically hit hard by budget cuts. For instance, VALLEYLIFE has had their funding cut by 15% since May 09. Paper Clouds Apparel wants to make sure the students don't feel the effects of such cuts. Less than 1% of the budget of the National Institute of Health is devoted to autism research. Along with our previously states desires, we are hoping that our cause can impact organizations researching causes.</p>
<p><strong>How you can help-</strong></p>
<p><strong>FUND</strong>- up until now Paper Clouds Apparel has been a one man operation. Paying for everything by many hours bartending, operating heavy machinery, and any other odd job I could find to make a buck. However, to take Paper Clouds Apparel to the next level and help millions of special needs individuals, I need your help !</p>

<p><strong>SPREAD THE WORD- </strong>Have a blog ? Know others who might be interested in helping Paper Clouds Apparel ? Spread the word by any means available. None of this will be possible without <strong>YOU !</strong></p>
<p><strong>Why Bamboo ?</strong></p>
<p>Bamboo is one of the world's most sustainable resources. As the fastest growing grass on Earth, bamboo roots continually sprout new shoots without the need for fertilizers or harmful pesticides. Commercial cotton uses only 2.4% of the world's arable land; however cotton requires the use of 24% of the world's insecticide market and 11% of the sale of global pesticide chemicals in the form of fertilizers and pesticides. Creating a single cotton t-shirt requires <strong>700</strong> gallons of water, a bamboo t-shirt requires 34 gallons of water. The production of bamboo clothing has a lower impact on the environment than the conventional cotton farming methods. Bamboo fabric also feels like a cross between silk and cashmere, super soft to the skin. Bamboo fabric offers comfort, is highly absorbent, hypoallergenic, has wicking abilities, more breathable than cotton, and a natural sheen. Did we mention how comfortable it is ? We LOVE bamboo !!</p>
<p><strong>How the shirts fit-</strong></p>
<p>The shirts do run a little small. So if in doubt order a size larger. However, if the shirt does not fit you just how you would like, Paper Clouds Apparel will make sure you get a shirt that does fit you. We want you to love your Paper Clouds Apparel shirt and wear it all the time !!</p>
<p><strong><br/></strong><strong>Don't Forget to let us know which shirt and in what size you want :)</strong></p>

<h2>Real quick</h2>
<ul>
<li>A universe of alternate history of the second half of the XX century, with trading, piracy and epic battles.</li>
<li>Lots of real warships and submarines</li>
<li>Single-player mode - Offline or Online (Coop)</li>
<li>Global game universe for all players</li>
<li>No Subscriptions</li>
<li>No Pay to Win</li>
</ul><p>For more information, there’s a lot to read down below, and there is a lot of info <a href=""http://forum.seacraft.sc"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">on our forums</a>, especially in <a href=""http://forum.seacraft.sc/en/index.php?/forum/29-how-does-it-work/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">HDIW magazine</a> issues. Also - all games come with a digital copy of the Manual.</p>
<h3><strong>Here’s the deal</strong></h3>
<p>We're doing crowdfunding on IndieGoGo and <a href=""http://forum.seacraft.sc/en/index.php?/store/category/2-"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">our own website</a>.</p>
<p>The great news that project will be released in any case (as we're fans of our action), but its size depends on you! We need your support to make it best - the money raised on our site and here on IndieGoGo are combined to determine which of the main stretch goals we’ve met.</p>
<p><img alt=""Sctretch Goals"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://vault.hiazma.net/other/IGG/seacraft_levels.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We work closely with the community, so the order of feature integration will be fitted.</p>
<h2><img alt=""SeaCraft Rundown"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://vault.hiazma.net/other/IGG/hdr_seacraftRundown.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></h2>
<h3>Realism</h3>
<p>We want to create a really deep and many-sided gameplay. There are no straight solutions, strict rules and restrictions in the real naval warfare. There is only knowledge of equipment, strategies, ability and luck. <strong>Forget about annoying HP straps</strong>, we want every shell to bring an emotional chute-the-chute. Enemy detection systems are damaged? Adjust your tactics on the fly or perish. And of course there is no place to the ""golden invulnerable ship of 80th level"". Any combat ship like old Komsomolets or new Sea Lion brings death and destruction and makes headways to the victory.</p>
<p>The main idea is classic - easy to start, difficult to master. Our balance approach and unique setting give us ability to create fantastic game for different player skills - from casual action to hardcore depth!</p>
<h3>Abundance of the high lvl content</h3>
<p>Possibly everyone encounters a situation when your favorite online game bores in a couple of months. All levels are completed, the breast bends under pressure of medals, your trophies occupy an area of a small hangar. And there is nothing for you to do in the game. We consider this way to be wrong. We want our game to be interesting for you after one month, one year or three years of active gameplay. We are sure that interesting, manifold battles, numerous events and random adventures, regular championships and tournaments, open global war is the right way to this goal.</p>
<h3>The Style</h3>
<p>SeaCraft uses the original setting of the <strong>second half of the XX century</strong> - great confrontation of two superpowers led to a full-scale military conflict. Now you are the one to create the new history of the world. The time has come to find the best captain!</p>
<h3>Micro Updates Rule!</h3>
<p>We want to create the whole naval battle universe, and once live, we'll have a team of people adding content on a regular basis. So, there will be <strong>always</strong> fresh data, stories, ships, weapons and ingame events. We're creating game for gamers first, so with micro updates we'll react to the needs and actions of the players.</p>
<h3>Pay Once, Play Forever</h3>
<p>There are no subscriptions in our game and you won't pay again and again to play comfortable.</p>
<h2><img alt=""The World On Fire"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://vault.hiazma.net/other/IGG/hdr_worldOnFire.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></h2>
<h3>The Map</h3>
<p>Our Global War is not a siege of fortresses at Thursdays, this is a complex and manifold game within the game. It depends on you whether to become a member of a large clan or be a one-man boat, to have an old combat ship or a NPS - the fate of the world will <strong>depend on You</strong>. Mining resources, construction of new ships, piracy, mercenary activities, diplomacy, global events... You will not feel bored ;)</p>
<p>First thing you should know about the global war - you will participate in it. It doesn't matter whether you join a random battle for 15 minutes during the lunch or you are the member of the best squadron in the best clan - every fight will directly affect the situation on the global map. Any battle within the game is linked to a certain territory on the front line. The amount of victories and defeats is compared and, on its basis, it is decided which direction the front line will move.</p>
<p>No one knows what will be with the World in the war like this. Maybe you'll fight in <strong>sunken Red Square or New York</strong>? With our ""new history simulation"" concept all is possible and players will write the Story.</p>
<h3>Price of Money</h3>
<p>The second important thing in the global war is that the war is won not only by soldiers and commanders, but also manufacturers and economists. Every sunken ship requires the time and resources for replacement and will be a tar baby for your country. Territories provide resources required for fleet construction.</p>
<p>Top-rank ships are very expensive and <strong>can be lost irretrievably</strong> during the battle. However, some clans may afford building several missile cruisers. Huge giants of steel with numerous guns and missile pads can become a real demonstration of your power. And a desired target for the enemy captain. Repair of such vessel and, moreover, its loss, can affect greatly clan's treasury.</p>
<h3>Jolly Roger</h3>
<p>Only venturous captains dare to become <strong>pirates</strong>. Regardless your goals - going for the gold or sense of justice - start your own war. Even well guarded convoy is not a barrier for absolute war.</p>
<p>On the other side, you can become a mercenary and get revenues from the ""official"" robbery</p>
<h2><img alt=""Weapons Of Victory"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://vault.hiazma.net/other/IGG/hdr_weaponsOfVictory.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></h2>
<p>What is more absorbing — to be a daring captain of a missile boat or a sober-minded submarine admiral? Missile and torpedo boats, submarines and submarine hunters, cruisers and battleships and other deadly toys will become your instruments for achievement of global domination in the sea.</p>
<p>Let me show the idea:</p>
<p><a href=""http://vault.hiazma.net/other/IGG/seacraft_en_ShipTree_USA.jpg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><img alt=""USA Tree"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://vault.hiazma.net/other/IGG/tb_seacraft_en_ShipTree_USA.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></a>   <a href=""http://vault.hiazma.net/other/IGG/seacraft_en_ShipTree_USSR.jpg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><img alt=""USSR Tree"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://vault.hiazma.net/other/IGG/tb_seacraft_en_ShipTree_USSR.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></a></p>
<p>We want to add <strong>aircraft carriers</strong> and other countries.. It's in your hands ;)</p>
<p><img alt=""Knox Class Frigate"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://vault.hiazma.net/other/IGG/seacraft_en_Knox.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>His friend's shoulder</h3>
<p>You can operate one ship with friends to increase it's control. For example, when player's missile boar is destroyed or totally damaged he can ""go out"" and<strong> take a seat</strong> on ally's battlecruiser to control the artillery or take a fly on it's <strong>helicopter</strong>.</p>
<h2><img alt=""Armory"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://vault.hiazma.net/other/IGG/hdr_armory.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></h2>
<p><a href=""http://vault.hiazma.net/other/PR/HDIW/SeaCraft_HDIW_EN_002_scheme_1.jpg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><img alt=""Weapons scheme"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://vault.hiazma.net/other/PR/HDIW/SeaCraft_HDIW_EN_002_scheme_1.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></a></p>
<p>The scheme should be inspected beginning with the center. There are 6 types of weapons, 3 of them are located on the top and are responsible for the above water world, and another 3 serve as an under water weapon.</p>
<p>Each type has its own task divided into subtasks. Let's say, special cruise missiles can destroy an NPS at long range, and if it moves closer, an antisubmarine bomb will be used.</p>

<h3>Missiles</h3>

<h3>Stretch goals?</h3>
<p>The purpose of the higher stretch goals is to ensure that the game-as-described is finished in the six month time period. We intend to build the game as described regardless, but without additional funding we are going to have to do it one piece at a time, rather than as a single larger production. With more funding we can include more ships, systems, unique locations and events.</p>

Real quick

A universe of alternate history of the second half of the XX century, with trading, piracy and epic battles.
Lots of real warships and submarines
Single-player mode - Offline or Online (Coop)
Global game universe for all players
No Subscriptions
No Pay to Win
For more information, there’s a lot to read down below, and there is a lot of info on our forums, especially in HDIW magazine issues. Also - all games come with a digital copy of the Manual.
Here’s the deal
We're doing crowdfunding on IndieGoGo and our own website.
The great news that project will be released in any case (as we're fans of our action), but its size depends on you! We need your support to make it best - the money raised on our site and here on IndieGoGo are combined to determine which of the main stretch goals we’ve met.

We work closely with the community, so the order of feature integration will be fitted.

Realism
We want to create a really deep and many-sided gameplay. There are no straight solutions, strict rules and restrictions in the real naval warfare. There is only knowledge of equipment, strategies, ability and luck. Forget about annoying HP straps, we want every shell to bring an emotional chute-the-chute. Enemy detection systems are damaged? Adjust your tactics on the fly or perish. And of course there is no place to the ""golden invulnerable ship of 80th level"". Any combat ship like old Komsomolets or new Sea Lion brings death and destruction and makes headways to the victory.
The main idea is classic - easy to start, difficult to master. Our balance approach and unique setting give us ability to create fantastic game for different player skills - from casual action to hardcore depth!
Abundance of the high lvl content
Possibly everyone encounters a situation when your favorite online game bores in a couple of months. All levels are completed, the breast bends under pressure of medals, your trophies occupy an area of a small hangar. And there is nothing for you to do in the game. We consider this way to be wrong. We want our game to be interesting for you after one month, one year or three years of active gameplay. We are sure that interesting, manifold battles, numerous events and random adventures, regular championships and tournaments, open global war is the right way to this goal.
The Style
SeaCraft uses the original setting of the second half of the XX century - great confrontation of two superpowers led to a full-scale military conflict. Now you are the one to create the new history of the world. The time has come to find the best captain!
Micro Updates Rule!
We want to create the whole naval battle universe, and once live, we'll have a team of people adding content on a regular basis. So, there will be always fresh data, stories, ships, weapons and ingame events. We're creating game for gamers first, so with micro updates we'll react to the needs and actions of the players.
Pay Once, Play Forever
There are no subscriptions in our game and you won't pay again and again to play comfortable.

The Map
Our Global War is not a siege of fortresses at Thursdays, this is a complex and manifold game within the game. It depends on you whether to become a member of a large clan or be a one-man boat, to have an old combat ship or a NPS - the fate of the world will depend on You. Mining resources, construction of new ships, piracy, mercenary activities, diplomacy, global events... You will not feel bored ;)
First thing you should know about the global war - you will participate in it. It doesn't matter whether you join a random battle for 15 minutes during the lunch or you are the member of the best squadron in the best clan - every fight will directly affect the situation on the global map. Any battle within the game is linked to a certain territory on the front line. The amount of victories and defeats is compared and, on its basis, it is decided which direction the front line will move.
No one knows what will be with the World in the war like this. Maybe you'll fight in sunken Red Square or New York? With our ""new history simulation"" concept all is possible and players will write the Story.
Price of Money
The second important thing in the global war is that the war is won not only by soldiers and commanders, but also manufacturers and economists. Every sunken ship requires the time and resources for replacement and will be a tar baby for your country. Territories provide resources required for fleet construction.
Top-rank ships are very expensive and can be lost irretrievably during the battle. However, some clans may afford building several missile cruisers. Huge giants of steel with numerous guns and missile pads can become a real demonstration of your power. And a desired target for the enemy captain. Repair of such vessel and, moreover, its loss, can affect greatly clan's treasury.
Jolly Roger
Only venturous captains dare to become pirates. Regardless your goals - going for the gold or sense of justice - start your own war. Even well guarded convoy is not a barrier for absolute war.
On the other side, you can become a mercenary and get revenues from the ""official"" robbery

What is more absorbing — to be a daring captain of a missile boat or a sober-minded submarine admiral? Missile and torpedo boats, submarines and submarine hunters, cruisers and battleships and other deadly toys will become your instruments for achievement of global domination in the sea.
Let me show the idea:
   
We want to add aircraft carriers and other countries.. It's in your hands ;)

His friend's shoulder
You can operate one ship with friends to increase it's control. For example, when player's missile boar is destroyed or totally damaged he can ""go out"" and take a seat on ally's battlecruiser to control the artillery or take a fly on it's helicopter.


The scheme should be inspected beginning with the center. There are 6 types of weapons, 3 of them are located on the top and are responsible for the above water world, and another 3 serve as an under water weapon.
Each type has its own task divided into subtasks. Let's say, special cruise missiles can destroy an NPS at long range, and if it moves closer, an antisubmarine bomb will be used.
Read More in ""How does it works?"", #2 issue.
Missiles
Even small and outdated missile boats possess some kind of a manifold and arranged ABM/AA defense, starting from small air defense systems and ending with automatic guns. Let alone larger and modern ships.

A missile can be improved to overcome different ABM types. For example, shooting-off decoy targets will help to fight against anti-air missiles, and an improved electronics will not allow to blind the missile easily by EW warfare. However, the number of improvements is strictly limited, but the assortment and power of a particular ship's AA defense can be extensive. Let's say, the missile can evade the fire of an automatic cannon using better maneuvering, but the concentrated fire of 3-4 artillery systems will leave no chances. Thereat a missile cannot be protected from all types of AA warfare, it should be modified within the dockage facilities taking into account a concise specifics of ABM targets.

Big Bang
Tactical nuclear weapons are inside. Just think how demolishing could be a silent hunter armored with missiles or torpedoes with nuke!

Every sea conceals danger for travelers even for military vessels. You should be equally vigilant at calm or angry sea if you expect to see the seashore one more time.
PvP fights will be sessional (same as in many shooters), however, the gameplay differs greatly depends on gametype. From 4 to 32 players will take part in different battles, so you can choose what areas you like - from 6x6 km for high-pressure action to 33x33 km size for long strategic battles.

I created designs for cabinet door panels using exotic wood veneers and then applied lead and solder much like stained glass. Recently I came across these beautiful patina copper patterns and couldn't resist using them in place of the wood veneers. The patinas are made by hand so no two patterns can ever be the same. This adds even more uniqueness to each piece of work!              






The response has been so impressive I decided it's time to bring this to market on a much larger scale and this is where I need your help. Your contributions will make these unique products available on a level that I can not achieve on my own.The Coppertree puts a unique twist on the products by offering a choice of the patinas to fit individual tastes. Simply choose the ones that will match your decor and our software will show you a preview!
           


          
                              
   These door panels will add elegance to any cabinet! Custom designs available. 
  
  
                              
           What a cool way to match and compliment the cabinet door panels!

The leading process is one of the features that makes these products so unique. After the design has been mounted and sealed, the leading is applied over the seams and each joint is soldered. A bluing solution adds a dark patina to the leading for the final touch.

A common risk is the lack of consumers with needs for a particular product. My past experiences show me there are consumers who want and need distinctive handmade products that The CopperTree offers.
Another risk can be the cost of copper and skilled labor causing high end pricing but there are enough ways this technique can be applied that both high and moderate pricing can be achieved. Typical production costs for the door panels is $38.00s/f  while the cost of jewelry pieces is about $8.

<p>We are a team of people that are very experienced in building projects to exact specifications and delivering on time.  We have also surrounded ourselves with other successful partners with proven track records.  We are very confident in our ability to supply every order on time.  In fact,  we have already completed a full manufacturing run with our suppliers and manufacturers. The biggest obstacles for manufacturing have already been overcome which will GREATLY REDUCE YOUR RISK.  </p>
<p>Materials:  We have sourced all of the materials we need, completed our quality testing, safety testing and we have locked in pricing and shipping requirements. </p>
<p>Manufacturing:  We are teamed with a local manufacturer that has already done a first run for us.  They have been intimately involved in the product development and have all the resources needed to complete our order, and we love their lean manufacturing techniques!  They are aware of our schedule and we have top priority when our materials arrive in April.  </p>
<p>Shipping:  We have also partnered with a local fulfillment center.  We recently met with their team to further clarify the process and renegotiate shipping prices.  They have also been involved in the scheduling process and will be ready to fulfill all of our orders.  The owner of the fulfillment center is very excited for us, as she started her business from the ground up as well.  </p>

Compare Torch to Similar Heated Coats

Torch utilizes the same technology as the leading brands, but has huge advantages with this patented design.  By taking the heating elements out of the coat, Torch brings the heat pads closer to your body, which means less waste and more heat for you.  
But whats the real advantage?  Let's hear it from an outside source.
""Torch offers an affordable and versatile solution [to heated coats] that can be used on any of your coats."" Noel Palacios, Gadget Explained.


Beat The ColdLive your life without the weather restrictions.  Remember, there is no such thing as being cold, only unprepared.  With Torch you can be prepared for anything.  Be confident that your coat will keep you warm. 


 

One Heater - Any Coat - No Bundling 
Step 1: Pick Your Coat

 

Step 2: Install Torch


Step 3: Enjoy


 


Your Coat - Your Style
The coat you want to wear is rarely the most practical. With Torch, you now have the option to add a heater to whatever coat you can think of.  No more sacrificing comfort and style for functionality.

Risks and Challenges
We are a team of people that are very experienced in building projects to exact specifications and delivering on time.  We have also surrounded ourselves with other successful partners with proven track records.  We are very confident in our ability to supply every order on time.  In fact,  we have already completed a full manufacturing run with our suppliers and manufacturers. The biggest obstacles for manufacturing have already been overcome which will GREATLY REDUCE YOUR RISK.  
Materials:  We have sourced all of the materials we need, completed our quality testing, safety testing and we have locked in pricing and shipping requirements. 
Manufacturing:  We are teamed with a local manufacturer that has already done a first run for us.  They have been intimately involved in the product development and have all the resources needed to complete our order, and we love their lean manufacturing techniques!  They are aware of our schedule and we have top priority when our materials arrive in April.  
Shipping:  We have also partnered with a local fulfillment center.  We recently met with their team to further clarify the process and renegotiate shipping prices.  They have also been involved in the scheduling process and will be ready to fulfill all of our orders.  The owner of the fulfillment center is very excited for us, as she started her business from the ground up as well.

<h1><b>A revolutionary jacket that will change what we wear</b></h1>
<p>With busier cities and car traffic congestion, commuting by urban bike, by foot and public transit is rapidly getting popular. Most major cities are now providing commuting infrastructure, and some cities are even going to extreme levels by planning to ban all car traffic in city down town districts. With the growing community of urban commuters we need to evolve the clothing we wear from day to day. This inspired us to make to deliver a practical jacket for every ones daily urban use.</p>

<h1>Great Testimonials from our last campaign!</h1>
<h1>We did a fantastic job delivering our very first men's styles when it comes to quality,fit and comfort.</h1>
<p>Heather Webb said: Received my coat today, it's wonderful! Warm, comfy and just the right amount of stretch :) thanks so much  </p>
<p> Scott Kuo said: yay! i got my STRATUS jacket today! It is awesome and nice! Good job guys!  </p>
<p>Matthew. Got mine 23rd of Dec. Great timing btw. I waited a week for impressions. It was actually a freak 55 degrees in Chicago that day. Not a good test day. But it more appropriately dropped to 17 degrees one morning, and happy to report that the coat was sufficiently warm. Not sure about when it gets to -17, but we shall see. The coat has so far exceeded my expectations, which is a great thing when you blindly buy a $100+ coat through kickstarter. I love the color, which I feared would be too dark; it's a very nice dark army green, very unique. Fleece inside is very cozy. The lefty zipper will take some getting used to, and as one commentor mentioned, seems a little stiff due to the uniqueness of the outer fabric. Fits great and slim, but also long; something hard to come buy in retail shops. Overall a great jacket and pleased to rep the brand. Thanks a bunch. I had the Wander jacket btw. size S, dark olive</p>
<p> alex lee said: Sensational jacket. Picked it up from the Post Office a few days back. Looks great, fits well &amp; is mega-warm. Well done to all concerned. Many thanks!</p>
<p>larry cheng said: Just received my size medium Stratus jacket today in California. Looking forward to battling the next wave of El Niño with it!</p>

We also have factory minimums to be able to effectively deliver well priced, quality garments. We have yet to do a project where the results were good enough to finance the entire project. Some of our projects we have delivered on time or even a bit early, and some have been late. We will always deliver but the more successful the campaign is, the more resources we have to get the job done quicker.</p><br/><div><p></p></div><br/></div>","About this projectCOMMUTER OUTERWEAR COLLECTIONIntroducing the most versatile urban commuting jackets designed to keep you fashionably warm and dry for your daily commute.  Sweet Clothing is a small company that designs and produces the brand names Mia Melon and One Man Outerwear. We are starting to emerge thanks to the help of Crowdfunding, our supporters and retailers. Our niche is multi-use weatherproof fashion outerwear. We are in a very capital intensive industry with a niche group of products that serves our customers very well. Unfortunately to keep the costs and affordability reasonable, we need to make hundreds at at time. We hope that one day, one of these campaigns will not only support the project we are trying to finance, but maybe finance the company and give us financial stability. Thank you in advance for taking a look at our latest campaign. I hope you are compelled to support this campaign.URBAN STYLE + TECHNICAL FEATURES

Mia Melon Commuter Jacket Features
A revolutionary jacket that will change what we wear
With busier cities and car traffic congestion, commuting by urban bike, by foot and public transit is rapidly getting popular. Most major cities are now providing commuting infrastructure, and some cities are even going to extreme levels by planning to ban all car traffic in city down town districts. With the growing community of urban commuters we need to evolve the clothing we wear from day to day. This inspired us to make to deliver a practical jacket for every ones daily urban use.

Great Testimonials from our last campaign!
We did a fantastic job delivering our very first men's styles when it comes to quality,fit and comfort.
Heather Webb said: Received my coat today, it's wonderful! Warm, comfy and just the right amount of stretch :) thanks so much  
 Scott Kuo said: yay! i got my STRATUS jacket today! It is awesome and nice! Good job guys!  
Matthew. Got mine 23rd of Dec. Great timing btw. I waited a week for impressions. It was actually a freak 55 degrees in Chicago that day. Not a good test day. But it more appropriately dropped to 17 degrees one morning, and happy to report that the coat was sufficiently warm. Not sure about when it gets to -17, but we shall see. The coat has so far exceeded my expectations, which is a great thing when you blindly buy a $100+ coat through kickstarter. I love the color, which I feared would be too dark; it's a very nice dark army green, very unique. Fleece inside is very cozy. The lefty zipper will take some getting used to, and as one commentor mentioned, seems a little stiff due to the uniqueness of the outer fabric. Fits great and slim, but also long; something hard to come buy in retail shops. Overall a great jacket and pleased to rep the brand. Thanks a bunch. I had the Wander jacket btw. size S, dark olive
 alex lee said: Sensational jacket. Picked it up from the Post Office a few days back. Looks great, fits well & is mega-warm. Well done to all concerned. Many thanks!
larry cheng said: Just received my size medium Stratus jacket today in California. Looking forward to battling the next wave of El Niño with it!
AFFORDABLE QUALITY 

These jackets and hoodies are like buying a waterproof shell and a fleece hoodie all in one. Similar outdoor brands charge hundreds of dollars for big logo'd jackets that do not have much more function if any as our products. Supporting our project for production will save you as much as 33 % for a beautiful jacket or hoodie arriving only a 2-3 months later. So what are we waiting for? Help support us and save for something you will really put to good use!

 Risks and challengesOur business in the industry we are in needs a lot of working capital. We also have factory minimums to be able to effectively deliver well priced, quality garments. We have yet to do a project where the results were good enough to finance the entire project. Some of our projects we have delivered on time or even a bit early, and some have been late. We will always deliver but the more successful the campaign is, the more resources we have to get the job done quicker.",43.0,0,"3 Campaigns

Nevertheless we will keep some of the production at the previous size to satisfy our existing customers.If you have suggestions to colors you think will appeal to you and the general market, kindly let us know.VIEW MORE IN THE GALLERY....WE USE WEST AFRICAN ADINKRA IDEOGRAPHIC SYMBOLS TO DESIGNAdinkra Symbols are old ideograph scripts of expression used mainly by the Ashanti Kingdom, from West Africa; since the 1800's. Oral evidence proves that the scripts were used primarily through various medium and crafts such as clothing, jewelry, furniture and many more. The textile industry around that era used to print these symbolic scripts on Royal, War, funeral and other ceremonial clothing. The Royal family were known for expressing themselves through the symbols printed on their various clothing, on occasions of Victory after war, rewarding the brave and hardworking, marriage, the birth of a child, farewell to the dead and many more.WHO
WE ARE:Diviniti Wear Group is a registered limited
liability company under the Ghana Company’s code Act 1963 (act 179).


A fashion house which makes luxury Men's
African Clothing and Accessories, and we started our first production with
Luxury Adinkra Theme Design, 100% Silk Necktie set ranges.


The company is founded by 33 years old Ghanaian
entrepreneur Delali Kofi Adayi, based in Ghana.


Holds a Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Science and
Management, and a Master’s degree in Environmental Management and Policy from
the Wisconsin International University College and University of Cape Coast
respectively, all in Ghana.


After many years of working experience and love for
fashion, he ventured into the fashion industry with full vigor describing his venture
as his life’s fulfilling purpose, representing fashion brands such as EADEN
MYLES from Canada, IL DOGE from Turkey, Politet from Turkey  and many more across the world.


GUARANTEE YOUR LUXURY NECKTIES
GIFT ORDER FOR TOMORROW WITH A COST PRICE TODAY; AND REASONS ARE:

Unbudgeted funds for unplanned gift orders


 Late deliveries
due to the pressure on courier companies around these seasons.


Delays in customs clearance of parcels during these
seasons.


We can save more to support a rural child
during Thanksgiving, Christmas and The New Year in 5 Villages feeding a minimum
of 1000 Children per village.


OUR
EXPERIENCE, OUR LESSON:
In
September 2013, Diviniti Wear Group had a challenging experience of this rush,
we sold out  50% of our first production
of neckties gift sets before Christmas though our social media platform www.facebook.com/divinitiwear, and because the demand was so high we had to turn down
orders due to financial and time constraints, and this applies to many other
online and offline gift shops.YOUR
SUPPORT, OUR SUCCESS:

Increase
our delivery efficiency and improve customer interaction and satisfaction


Escape
the exponential exchange rate hike uncertainties e.g the exchange of our 1st
Production was 2:1 ratio over GHC to USD respectively, today its 3:1 GHC to USD
respectively.


Avoid
high interest loans. (A loan investment for start-up in Ghana is mostly 2.5 – 6% per month for only short periods 6 – 12 months)


Reduce cost of production by fulfilling
minimum order quantity demands

Price

PRODUCTION PROCESS
Before we order the
production of our designs, we undergo a series of reviews by our review team,
based on:



Designing 


Fabrics Sample Review and Quality Control


Products Sample Review and Quality Control

General survey of the
most demanded designs with regards to the design itself, the colour way, length
and size. This is because every design and its colour way is unique and must be
treated independently.

2013 MOST SOLD NECKTIES





We have also taken into account a strategic
consideration by producing the most demanded necktie designs and color way from
our first production.


OUR MILESTONES


We began our first production in September 2013 with a
total production of 1,000 neckties, 400 Cuff links, and 1500 Gift boxes and
bags.


This was financed through an owner’s equity of USD 5,
000.00 and acquired a USD 15, 000.00 loan facility.


Our expected average sales were targeted at USD 35,
000.00, with the price of a necktie gift set and we were able to sell 70% of
the total production at USD 29, 000 by 1st January, 2014. Our sales could only help pay expenses and make the full cost of loan repayment.


We were also able to have an inventory of call back
customers who kept coming back to check whether we had been able produce new
stock.

Our sales success was met through the promotion of our
products on the social media such Facebook across West Africa, South Africa, UK
and Canada, and also family and friends as well as first time customers through
other media platforms such as the news prints.                             
FAQWhat does the Standard Gift Package contain? Our Standard Gift Set Package includes:2 Neckties 100% Silk Woven Adinkra Design Necktie, self tipping and woolen interlining2 of 100% Silk Pocket square that complements
necktie



2 pairs of Stainless steel/Precious stones Cufflinks that
compliments necktie
Our idea of using
complementary pocket square and cufflinks is to make the entire package more
contemporary and unique, yet driving the Adinkra message.

The
 new extruder will adopt Teflon and aluminum alloy heat radiator for 
heat dissipation and duralumin alloy nozzle. It will have a 12V 
operating cooling fan. Its surface will be covered with anodic oxide 
coating, which can resist oxidation corrosion and increase nozzle 
hardness. Since the heat-insulated pipe is designed with Teflon, the 
material will not soften easily, thus ensuring finer and more stable 
printing. We are also installing a LED light to the extruder as well, which can be controlled by the LCD.<br/></p><p>We have been working hard since we launched the project to try and 
upgrade some features on the printer. We
 will be able to upgrade the LCD, making it easier to use and offering 
more options to control the whole machine without connecting the printer

problems in our world are solved by taking a bigger view. That’s why our
 project is aimed at designing the first large-format 3D printer that 
you can also take home or to work with you. It’s not only about taking 
the amazing technology of 3D printing and amplifying it. If we’re 
successful, we can envision entire markets opening up to use this 
technology. Markets which have struggled to maintain the status quo, let
 alone use some of the cutting-edge technology that for the rest of the 
world is an overnight delivery away. We believe that by making a 
production-quality model of our 3D printer, and putting it in the hands 
of small business owners anywhere on the planet, we will give them the 
flexibility to sustain their community, their business, and ultimately, 
the world we live in. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/837455/files/20140905173639-3d_prints2.JPG?1409963799"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/837458/files/20140905173831-3d_prints3.jpg?1409963911"" src="""" style=""width: 620px; height: 280px;""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/837462/files/20140905174030-3d_prints4.jpg?1409964030"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/837464/files/20140905174105-3d_prints5.jpg?1409964065"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p> <b>Here is what we offer: </b></p><p>Easy and Intuitive set up, The

starting this project is simple: there are no low-cost 3D printers that 
meet the quality standards of the professional designer. But, we became 
frustrated by the fact that all the professional-quality 3D printers 
were overly expensive – most cost thousands of dollars – and were so 
complex to use. Since early 2013, we decided to build a solution to 
solve this problem ourselves and we’re finally ready to show it to the 
world. </p><p><b>Why our Project Matters </b></p><p>Many prominent 
people believe 3D printing technology is not ready for the home. We 
respectfully disagree. When you help us to succeed, you are helping to 
bring this technology to everyone at a price that is easily affordable.
Our dream is to make the user experience of this technology as seamless 
as it can be and to open up the technology while at the same time not 
being greedy and squeezing our customers for unsustainable profits. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/837485/files/20140905175105-3d_prints7.JPG?1409964665"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>
<b>Affordability:</b></p><p> Starting below $700, Botler3D is one of the
 lowest cost assembled, pretested, fast and high quality 3D printer 
available – it’s even less expensive than many leading consumer 
printers. Printers currently on the market with similar build area (+/- 
3"" all axes) have an average price tag of $3,000-$5,000. Help us bring 
Botler to everyone at an affordable price!</p><p><b>What makes Botler3D different? </b>The
 results rivaling the best print quality of virtually every printer on 
the market at a price lower than most competitors'. Botler3D is 
top-notch from components to design and software to materials. This 
allows the machine very precise movement enabling extremely high print 
quality with minimum fuss.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/837487/files/20140905175301-3d_prints8.jpg?1409964781"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><b>Large Enclosed Build Area </b></p><p>It may be true that 90% of 3D
 Prints are less than 6”x4”x5” in size, but what do you do the other 10%
 of the time? Outsourcing large prints can be very expensive and gluing 
or bonding multiple piece prints is a real pain. </p><p>The Botler® 
printer is engineered to produce high resolution parts with the touch of
 a button. Botler® software is intuitive and simple to use so you can 
spend less time setting up prints and more time designing. </p><p>Botler®
 boasts a print volume (315 mm x 315 mm x 315 mm) because you never want
 equipment to limit your creativity. Smaller printers may be cheaper, 
but the peace of mind that Botler® gives you is priceless. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/837502/files/20140905180229-3d_prints9.jpg?1409965349"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><b>Heated Build Platform </b></p><p>Botler® features a heated 
aluminum build platform that allows printing with all varieties of 
materials without warping or lifting. The high-powered system provides 
consistent temperatures throughout a long build. </p><p>The build plate 
has some neat features. By using aluminum instead of glass you don't 
have to worry about the glass breaking when the nozzle hits the build 
plate.This saves time and money. The parts stay on the bed during 
printing and remove easily when done. The build plate locks into place 
without the commonly used binder clips.</p><p>Because we're using an all metal 
hotbed, your choice of 
printing materials is ABS and PLA.  It is possible that other 
filaments could be used, but only the above have been tested and 
confirmed to work.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/837507/files/20140905180852-3d_prints10.png?1409965732"" src="""" style=""""/></p><b>Stand-Alone Printing Capability </b><p></p><p>We wanted Botler® to be

<br/></div>","UPDATEWe have improved the current extruder we had. The
 new extruder will adopt Teflon and aluminum alloy heat radiator for 
heat dissipation and duralumin alloy nozzle. It will have a 12V 
operating cooling fan. Its surface will be covered with anodic oxide 
coating, which can resist oxidation corrosion and increase nozzle 
hardness. Since the heat-insulated pipe is designed with Teflon, the 
material will not soften easily, thus ensuring finer and more stable 
printing. We are also installing a LED light to the extruder as well, which can be controlled by the LCD.We have been working hard since we launched the project to try and 
upgrade some features on the printer. We
 will be able to upgrade the LCD, making it easier to use and offering 
more options to control the whole machine without connecting the printer
 directly to the computer, this LCD is one of the best options for 3D 
printing.What we are Doing We at Botler3D are creating a full 3D
 printing solution for home consumers. We want this technology to be 
available to everyone (at great and affordable prices!) and also easy to
 use for a positive user experience. Our long-term mission is to be 
innovative at every level of 3D printing, from object design all the way
 to printing and beyond.  Our Vision At Botlerlab, we believe that the biggest 
problems in our world are solved by taking a bigger view. That’s why our
 project is aimed at designing the first large-format 3D printer that 
you can also take home or to work with you. It’s not only about taking 
the amazing technology of 3D printing and amplifying it. If we’re 
successful, we can envision entire markets opening up to use this 
technology. Markets which have struggled to maintain the status quo, let
 alone use some of the cutting-edge technology that for the rest of the 
world is an overnight delivery away. We believe that by making a 
production-quality model of our 3D printer, and putting it in the hands 
of small business owners anywhere on the planet, we will give them the 
flexibility to sustain their community, their business, and ultimately, 
the world we live in.  Here is what we offer: Easy and Intuitive set up, The 
Botler3D is built to be as easily set up as possible. You do not need to
 mess around with raw spools of plastic lying around on your table 
because it is now integrated into the machine. There are no unnecessary 
wires or parts that get in the way and every Botler3D is fully set up 
and ready to go in minutes.Botler3D is disrupting 3D printingOur reason for 
starting this project is simple: there are no low-cost 3D printers that 
meet the quality standards of the professional designer. But, we became 
frustrated by the fact that all the professional-quality 3D printers 
were overly expensive – most cost thousands of dollars – and were so 
complex to use. Since early 2013, we decided to build a solution to 
solve this problem ourselves and we’re finally ready to show it to the 
world. Why our Project Matters Many prominent 
people believe 3D printing technology is not ready for the home. We 
respectfully disagree. When you help us to succeed, you are helping to 
bring this technology to everyone at a price that is easily affordable.
Our dream is to make the user experience of this technology as seamless 
as it can be and to open up the technology while at the same time not 
being greedy and squeezing our customers for unsustainable profits. 
Affordability: Starting below $700, Botler3D is one of the
 lowest cost assembled, pretested, fast and high quality 3D printer 
available – it’s even less expensive than many leading consumer 
printers. Printers currently on the market with similar build area (+/- 
3"" all axes) have an average price tag of $3,000-$5,000. Help us bring 
Botler to everyone at an affordable price!What makes Botler3D different? The
 results rivaling the best print quality of virtually every printer on 
the market at a price lower than most competitors'. Botler3D is 
top-notch from components to design and software to materials. This 
allows the machine very precise movement enabling extremely high print 
quality with minimum fuss.Large Enclosed Build Area It may be true that 90% of 3D
 Prints are less than 6”x4”x5” in size, but what do you do the other 10%
 of the time? Outsourcing large prints can be very expensive and gluing 
or bonding multiple piece prints is a real pain. The Botler® 
printer is engineered to produce high resolution parts with the touch of
 a button. Botler® software is intuitive and simple to use so you can 
spend less time setting up prints and more time designing. Botler®
 boasts a print volume (315 mm x 315 mm x 315 mm) because you never want
 equipment to limit your creativity. Smaller printers may be cheaper, 
but the peace of mind that Botler® gives you is priceless. Heated Build Platform Botler® features a heated 
aluminum build platform that allows printing with all varieties of 
materials without warping or lifting. The high-powered system provides 
consistent temperatures throughout a long build. The build plate 
has some neat features. By using aluminum instead of glass you don't 
have to worry about the glass breaking when the nozzle hits the build 
plate.This saves time and money. The parts stay on the bed during 
printing and remove easily when done. The build plate locks into place 
without the commonly used binder clips.Because we're using an all metal 
hotbed, your choice of 
printing materials is ABS and PLA.  It is possible that other 
filaments could be used, but only the above have been tested and 
confirmed to work.Stand-Alone Printing Capability We wanted Botler® to be
 an easy to use stand-alone printer since it is expensive and 
inconvenient to have an extra computer lying around to keep a 3D printer
 running. The Botler® control panel has a LCD control screen and built 
in SD Card reader that allows users to load and initiate prints with the
 push of a button. Who is Botler3D for? 
Architects- print out model homes and buildings for clients. Change and print out again without hassle.

High resolution belongs on your desktop.
We've been hard at work for over a year and with your help, we’re ready 
to take Botler into full-fledged production. By supporting this effort, 
you’ll be the first to get your hands on an amazing 3D printer and help 
usher in a new era of 3D printing – an era in which your creative output
 is no longer limited by price or dauntingly complex machines. What is Botler? Botler3D is the ultimate 3D printer 
everyone has been waiting for. We combined the best minds from the open 
source community, the best hardware we believe can give the best prints,
 and our own ideas based on our experience working with 3D printers. 
What we created ended up being a functional 3D printer with an 
attractive, sleek design that is also so user-friendly that you could 
teach your children how to use it.Mechanicals Why ours is better 
Current 3D printers have a very unfinished feel to them. By improving 
the aesthetics of a 3D printer as well as making the device more 
user-friendly, we felt this could bridge the gap to mass adoption of 3D 
printing. Along with that, we want to also keep final price affordable 
so it would make economical sense to purchase a Botler.  Highlights

I began working for a family business as my first job in high school. Since then I have work for a few different major companies but have always had the dream of working for myself one day. Since my freshmen year in high school I have self taught myself HTML and CSS and began building my own website to reach that goal. I then decided to take things one step further after my daughter was born and try and find funding to open my own shop so I be with my family more. My dream has never been about making it rich as much as its been about bringing my love for design to people through clothing at a fair price. We strive to bring graphics for anyone and everyone. So whether your planning a birthday party, bachelor/bachelorette party, family reunion or just want something fresh and new we want to have it for you. </p>

<p>Hello everyone!  I'm
Lindsay, and I am originally from Gretna, Nebraska USA.  I am currently
living in Paris, France attending my last year in design school.  This
year is extremely important for me.  This year is the year that I graduate
and become an employee rather than a student.  I have the best professors
at my school; they have worked for big names in the fashion world such as Yves
Saint Laurent, Alaïa, Chanel and Dior (to name a few). Now they are teaching me what
they have learned from some of the best Haute Couture artists in the
world!  I am extremely thankful in having them in my life. <br/><br/>
Since this is my senior year I am designing my senior collection. I want to design an optical illusion that both
tricks your mind but is still highly wearable.  This is a challenging
undertaking and in order to do this I really need your help so I can assemble my
team and buy the supplies I need to succeed.  In developing an optical
illusion (especially using fabric) the imagery being displayed must be measured
and lined up perfectly or else the optical illusion will not work.  I have
the best teachers to advise me with respect to sewing and design. 
However, I must find models that are all the same size and height in order to
make the illusion work.  I have created my own optical illusion design
through Illustrator and Photoshop.  Now I need to find someone to take my
design and physically print it onto fabric.  Once my collections are
completed and being modeled I would like to push my illusion one step further
by filming it and creating a photo look book.  Once completed, the final step
is to compile a creative portfolio and go after my dream job. </p>
<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>If I am able to meet my
financial goal I see myself going all the way with this idea and definitely
raising an eyebrow with the potential companies I would like to work for. <br/><b>Models</b> - are very important in order to make my idea work.  Since I
will be hiring them, they will never miss any fittings that I have during my
creation process.  I can also choose models that have the same build and
height.  That way my illusion will look and be precise. <br/><b>Fabric/Materials</b> - Very important in the Haute Couture world.  It
is not considered Haute Couture if the materials I use are not high quality. <br/><b>Supplies </b>- I need to purchase a video and film camera.  This is an
important part of my portfolio as I will be able to create a unique video that
helps people visualize the concepts I have developed.  At the present time
I am using the camera on my phone and my MacBook computer to do all filming and
photography (not to mention cereal and pasta boxes for the tripod).  Although
this has worked in the past for my needs, it is not the best image and I will
not be taken seriously if I use this type of equipment for my portfolio.  <br/><b>Portfolio –</b> If I reach the monetary goal I have set it will enable me to
order a professionally made portfolio.  This type of portfolio is
important because it will show the Haute Couture houses I too, am a
perfectionist. <br/>
Even if I cannot reach my total monetary goal any amount will help and I will
have to figure out the rest. I am committed to this project and will figure out
a way. I am a college student that has made minimum wage over the years.  In
order to make my ideas work and come alive I need your help. Any amount you
might be able to give will help me out immensely.  </p>
<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Honestly, any amount given will
help.  If I am successful in raising this money I will keep every
contributor updated with final photos and share the link to my video as
well.  (Read more about how I will give back to you in
""Perks"").  My whole life’s goal is to get hired at a Haute
Couture house for my creativity and skill.  It is my dream to work for Chanel;
to become a family member.  If I am able to work for them, I can only
imagine how I will grow and continue to learn the art of Haute Couture. 
My final goal in life is to open my own brand of clothing and become
""LAH"". I have worked very hard already; making it to the last year in
design school is difficult.  I started in a very small town in Nebraska,
USA, took a stepping-stone in Colorado, USA, and made a leap to Paris, France. 
I have landed on my feet every time.  Now I need your help to finish what
I started with school and begin my career as a Haute Couture designer. 
This is not simply an art project.  This portfolio of mine is the door to
my future.  Please help me reach my future.  I cannot do this alone. </p>
<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There are a lot of risks and
challenges in design.  Nothing works the first time in any design
process.  I am a problem solver.  Through the years of design school
I have drawn a collection, faced several problems, and then produced something
beautiful at the end.  I will have challenges with this idea as well. 
I am certain I can solve the problems I may encounter with this project because
I am passionate for what I do.  I know I can't do something perfectly the
first time.  This is why I am starting now even though my senior line is
not due until graduation, May 1, 2015.  Starting early enough allows me the
time to tackle any challenges that I encounter with this project; no matter how
big or small.  My goal is to enter the job market in May; I have been
preparing for that moment for the last 3 years and this is my final step. 
</p>
<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
If
you are unable to contribute that is perfectly ok!  I just ask to please
help me get my story out to anyone you think would be interested in helping me. 
Also, I would love advice of any kind!  The more help I get the stronger I
will become.  If you have any questions please feel free to ask! 
Thank you so much!

To the left of the village tower there is a tent. Is it the beer tent? Is it the festival music tent? Part of the Handmade Village? Maybe it is meant to symbolize festival camping, such a unique facet of the Winnipeg Folk Festival...or maybe it is intended to represent 'all of the above'... There is only so much real estate on a t-shirt, after all.</span></h3><h3><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">In the foreground, tied to the village tower, the dates of the event are shown on a tarp... Ah, yes, the ubiquitous tarp...so much a part of Winnipeg Folk Fest culture as well...</span></h3><h3><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Above, I cobbled together a few song birds in flight using shapes subtly inspired by musical notes and notations...</span></h3><h3><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Capping it all as if, at this point, any festival goer still needed it...we see the name of the event, flying high... the folksy, sometimes carnival, atmosphere implied through familiar font, flapping banner, and the hand carved linocut process itself.</span></h3><h3><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><br/></span></h3><h3><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">This unique and original shirt design is my tribute to the 2014 Winnipeg Folk Festival.

My work has won a few awards over the years, and I've been earning my living through my art for over 20 years now. I created my latest linocut design to be printed on t-shirts, as  a tribute to the well known Winnipeg folk festival.My most important goal was to avoid creating a design that was just a  mish-mash of generic cliches that could be used for *any* music or folk festival shirt. I thought it was really important to come up with a design that was unmistakably inspired by the Winnipeg Folk Festival. The t-shirt design centres around my interpretation of the new, iconic, Village Tower/structure that was added to the festival grounds last year. The tower was built with the idea of it being a central meeting point for festival goers, and it was designed for and inspired by the festival, so it seemed kind of a no-brainer, to use it as the starting point of a Winnipeg Folk Festival inspired design.Here is an interesting link to more info about the structure:http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/arts-and-life/entertainment/music/a-village--for-the-people-214460981.htmlOn the right hand side of the design, I carved in one of the unique covered festival stages, complete with crowd, hands waving in the air. To the left of the village tower there is a tent. Is it the beer tent? Is it the festival music tent? Part of the Handmade Village? Maybe it is meant to symbolize festival camping, such a unique facet of the Winnipeg Folk Festival...or maybe it is intended to represent 'all of the above'... There is only so much real estate on a t-shirt, after all.In the foreground, tied to the village tower, the dates of the event are shown on a tarp... Ah, yes, the ubiquitous tarp...so much a part of Winnipeg Folk Fest culture as well...Above, I cobbled together a few song birds in flight using shapes subtly inspired by musical notes and notations...Capping it all as if, at this point, any festival goer still needed it...we see the name of the event, flying high... the folksy, sometimes carnival, atmosphere implied through familiar font, flapping banner, and the hand carved linocut process itself.This unique and original shirt design is my tribute to the 2014 Winnipeg Folk Festival. I hope other Festival lovers appreciate the thought and work that went into this.I didn't create this with the goal of it never seeing the festival grounds. I hope to see as many festival goers wearing these as possible. It would really be a trip...and an honour... These will be mailed out by the last week of June, to be delivered in time for the festival.To be honest, I'm currently in kind of a tight spot, financially...and looking for a way to pay some bills... Nevertheless, I will be donating $1, from each shirt sold, to the Winnipeg Folk Festival Endowment Fund...just because I think it's the right thing to do... Here's a link to more info:http://winnipegfolkfestival.ca/support/ways-to-donate/All in all, about half of the money raised will go to the printing of the shirts, the other half goes to me.the more shirts that get ordered, the more money I will make per shirt.... So order soon and order often.Early Bird Bonus:The first 40 shirts will be shipped with an original signed and numbered linocut print of this same design.Please get the word out, about this project tweet, post, share the link...

It can be a normal feeling, something everyone experiences once in a while, but when experienced often and continuously the individual may suffer from an anxiety disorder. This in its turn can develop into agoraphobia or/and panic attacks.</p><p><b>         <a name=""panic"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">What is panic attack?</a> </b>A <span>panic attack (PA) is an extremely strong sudden fear for one's safeness, feeling intense body-mind sensations like heart palpitations, PVCs, chest pain, dizziness, shakiness, shortness of breath, accelerated heartbeat, having sensations of unreality, the most horrifying being the feeling of imminent death. Usually these emotions force a person to escape or flee the place where the attack began and in the future avoid this environment. Commonly when someone is having their first PA, they end up in the ER. It takes up to 20 min (my case) for it to pass, but it can reappear shortly if medication or proper autocontrol techniques are not used. However, medically speaking, PAs are not dangerous and do not lead to physical harm!</span> </p><p><b>         <a name=""agora"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">What is agoraphobia?</a> </b>Agoraphobia is an anxiety disorder where an individual perceives the environment to be dangerous, life threatening. This way simple social situations like football game, at work, shopping malls, movie-theatre, airports, bridges or even just walking around the corner of the house can easily set up an panic attack. This forces that person to avoid every place that triggered in the past unpleasant thoughts or sensations. In many cases the only panic free space is his/her own house, especially when there is someone who can oversee you.</p><p></p><p>        <b> <a name=""pvc"" rel=""nofollow noopener""> What are PVCs?</a></b> PVC - premature ventricular contractions (extrasystoles) are the skipped beats of the heart felt like palpitations, strong sudden beats, sensation of a suction in stomach or throat, or in many cases not felt at all. When related to anxiety, PVCs tend to occur as a cause of adrenalin rush, and a proper breathing-relaxation technique should be enough to stop them. However when someone is having a panic disorder, it’s quite hard to break the vicious cycle without medication, this way every single skipped beat is so terrifying and frightening like if you would have each and every time a heart attack. </p>     <b><a name=""meds"" rel=""nofollow noopener""> What medication?</a></b> I was taking Xanax (Alprazolam) for several years, though there were periods when I stayed in my comfort zone and was able to get rid of Xanax for a few days. But as soon as there was an exam or a medium stress event came up I was forced to take medication. Since 2015 I pushed myself to diminish Xanax intake from 5mg per month to 0,5 mg per month! Nowadays (August 2015) when I have severe headaches, because of emotional stress, I may take 0,12mg of Xanax but I am doing my best to do sports instead of taking pills. Take a look at my medication intake chart that I have been completing for the last 5 months. In 150 days I took only 2mg of Xanax, and soon, I wont be needing it at all! <br/><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1440524247/skynbhsrium8zdx8xnzq.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p>This publication is personal, it doesn't encourage the use of a drug of those mentioned or promote the image of a particular pharmaceutical company!</p><p>        <b> <a name=""stress"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Why I had a stressful lifestyle?</a></b> Back in 2010 I was doubting my future, I was unsure what I wanted to do in life, I quit  any sport I used to do, I no longer wanted to continue my medical studies, etc. I began to skip classes, arguing with my parents and girlfriend on trivial matters. I was still trying to lead an active life as a student, I was working as a surgical medical assistant at a hospital, participating in scientific researches, etc., but I was hoping that somehow University will be soon finished without me and everybody will leave me alone. This inner fight continued and grew bigger and bigger with every month. Starting with 2011 I started playing a computer game, and that became my only island of peace and safeness. However I perfectly understood at that moment that I am sinking in my pleasure and I am spiritually suiciding. But I had no power of will to change myself and change the way I saw the world. I started to ignore people, eveniments, classes, family .. everything, anyone. I remember myself back then as very nervous, easily annoyed and mad at everyone, especially at myself.This bomb slowly grew up to April 2012 when I had my first panic attack. It was as if a hammer hit me on the head, then  uncontrollable shaking, blurry vision and a constant feeling of fear. With the little medical knowledge I had at the time I thought I had a stroke. I was sure that something went wrong in my head and I was going to die. That day I ended up in the ER. Being so far from home, I started to panic, and even if I consulted doctors and made every possible medical investigation I still believed that there is something wrong with me. This is when I  began to take pills. I halted my studies for a year. Video games became my life. I started to have quite a lot PVCs, which became my most powerful panic attacks triggers. I thought I had a heart attack each and every time I had a skipped beat. I made even more medical investigations, and even if that proved everything was just fine, I didn't believe it. I completely isolated myself. Even though I was trying to change things my anxiety, my insecurity, was every time much greater than my wish to alter. Pills were my solution.</p><p>         <b> <a name=""life"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">How I shifted my lifestyle?</a></b> I felt guilty every time I took a pill. I was missing the freedom of walking alone. I was missing the gym, cycling, badminton, tennis that I used to do. I tried to make some workouts but PVCs stopped me everytime from doing them. Since summer 2013 I tried to do at least I could, but the fear of having PVCs or headache halted me anyway. With the support of my family I went back to studies. I had even more stress and anxiety. But the thought that this problem of mine could last for the rest of my life was killing me. My inner fight for freedom was winning, up until a severe panic attack. And then I tried again, and every time I failed. I’ve tried acupuncture for several times, I can’t say it made a big change. I had some psychoanalytic discussions. I tried to do at least some sort of physical exercises. At some point everything was in van. No major changes, same number of panic attacks or/and headaches or fear. I hated myself for whom I was. I was trying not to believe my senses but to trust my rational thinking. No matter how strange or scary my feelings were I began to think differently, to negate my senses! That was hard but that was my one way ticket, my only option. Then I tried to work with my thoughts, senses, feelings, to understand them, and finally.. to control them. Since 2015 I diminished 10 times my medication intake. I did that through sport, reading, dancing and other positive activities. To even accelerate my comeback I am doing each day at least one of following: calisthenics exercises, cycling, jogging or swimming and guess what, I am PVC free for 9 months. Lots of other complicated problems are awaiting me in life, I don’t how to solve them yet, that’s why I am not stopping here, I will fight every day to make the best out of my choices. You can take my ticket, its free.</p><p></p><p><span>If you have any questions you can always contact me:</span></p><p><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/roman.cobiletchi"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><b></b><b>Facebook:</b></a> <b>Roman Cobiletchi</b><br/></p><p><b><a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/individuals/11896469"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Indiegogo</a></b>: <b>Roman Cobiletchi</b></p><br/><p><br/></p><p></p><hr/><h4 style=""text-align: center;""><span><a name=""ro"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Româna</a></span></h4><hr/><h3>

<p>        <b> <a name=""anxro"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Ce este anxietatea?</a></b> - Anxietatea este o senzație puternică caracterizată printr-o stare internă neplacută, însoțită de nervozitate, senzații ciudate prin corp, impresie de pericol iminent. Poate fi o trăire normală, pe care fiecare o poate simți uneori, dar când devine frecventă și continuă, persoana poate suferi de tulburare de anxietate. Aceasta, la rândul ei, se poate dezvolta în agorafobie și/sau atacuri de panică.</p>        <b> <a name=""atkro"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Ce este un atac de panică?</a></b> Un atac de panică (AP) este o frică extrem de puternică apărută brusc, însoțită de senzații psiho-somatice, precum palpitații, extrasistole, durere toracică, amețeli, tremur, respirație îngreunată, ritm cardiac accelerat, senzații de irealitate, iar cel mai înspăimântător este sentimentul morții iminente. De obicei aceste trăiri forțează persoana să evadeze din locul unde atacul de panică a început și să îl evite chiar pe viitor. Adesea, când cineva are pentru prima dată un atac de panică, ajunge să se adreseze la Urgență. Durează până la 20 minute (în cazul meu), dar poate să reapară în scurt timp, dacă nu se administrează nici un medicament sau nu se efectuează tehnici de auto-control. Totuși, din punct de vedere medical, atacurile de panică nu sunt periculoase și nu aduc nici o daună fizică organismului!</div>
<p>         <b><a name=""agoro"" rel=""nofollow noopener""> Ce este agorafobia?</a> </b>Agorafobia este o tulburare de anxietate, în care persoana percepe mediul ambiant drept periculos, amenințător pentru viață. Situații de viață cu adevărat inofensive cum ar fi jocurile de fotbal, locul de la serviciu, magazinele, cinematografele, aeroporturile, podurile sau chiar plimbările prin cartier ar putea cu ușurință declanșa un atac de panică. Aceasta forțează persoana să evite orice locație care anterior a generat gânduri sau senzații neplăcute. Adesea, unicul spațiu cu risc scăzut de a porni un atac de panică rămâne propria locuință, în special dacă acolo mai este cineva care te supraveghează.</p>
<p>        <b> <a name=""extraro"" rel=""nofollow noopener""> Ce sunt extrasistolele?</a> </b>Extrasistola - este o contracție ventriculară prematură, care este simțită precum palpitație, bătaie puternică subită, senzație de constrângere în stomac sau gât, sau adesea nu este simțită deloc. Când se referă la anxietate, extrasistolele apar din cauza unui flux masiv de adrenalină, iar o tehnică respiratorie adecvată de relaxare ar fi trebuit să fie suficientă pentru a le opri. Totuși, când cineva are atacuri de panică, este destul de dificil de rupt acest cerc vicios fără medicație, în acest fel fiecare bătaie de cord este atât de înspăimântătoare și deranjantă, de parcă ai suferi de fiecare dată un infarct miocardic.</p>
<p>        <b> <a name=""medro"" rel=""nofollow noopener""> Care medicamente?</a></b> Eu am luat Xanax (Alprazolam) timp de mai mulți ani, totuși existau perioade când rămâneam în zona mea de confort și reușeam să scap de Xanax pe câteva zile. Dar cum un examen sau un stres de intensitate medie apăreau, eram din nou forțat să iau medicamentul. Începând cu 2015, m-am obligat să scad doza de Xanax de la 5 mg pe lună la 0,5 mg pe lună. Acum (august 2015), când am o durere de cap puternică din cauza unui stres emoțional, aș putea să iau 0,12 mg de Xanax, dar încerc să fac sport în loc. Priviți la reprezentarea grafică cu medicamentele administrate timp de ultimele 5 luni. Timp de 150 zile am luat doar 2mg de Xanax, iar curând nu voi mai avea deloc nevoie de el!</p>

Încercam totuși să duc o viață activă în calitate de student, lucram în calitate de asistent chirurgical la un spital, participam la lucrări de cercetare științifică, etc., dar speram că cumva universitatea se va sfârși fără mine și toți mă vor lăsa în pace. Această luptă internă continua să crească din ce în ce mai mare cu fiece lună. Începând cu anul 2011, am găsit un joc la PC și acesta a devenit unica oază de pace și siguranță. Totuși, înțelegeam perfect la acel moment că mă scufund în propria plăcere și mă sinucid spiritual. Dar nu aveam nici o putere de voință să mă schimb și să schimb felul în care vedeam lumea. Am început să ignor oamenii, evenimentele, cursurile, familia … totul, pe toți. Îmi amintesc de mine pe atunci ca fiind foarte nervos, ușor de plictisit și iritat de toți, în special de mine însumi. Această bombă încet-încet a crescut până în aprilie 2012, când am simțit primul meu atac de panică.

Fiind departe de casă, am început să fiu anxios și, chiar dacă am fost consultat de medici și am trecut orice investigație posibilă, oricum credeam că ceva nu e în regulă cu mine. de atunci am început să iau medicamente. Am luat o pauză de la studii pe un an. Jocurile video au devenit viața mea. Am început să simt destul de multe extrasistole, care deveniseră triggerul cel mai important al atacurilor mele de panică. Credeam că am infarct miocardic odată cu fiecare extrasistolă. Am trecut și mai multe investigații și chiar dacă toate rezultatele arătau foarte bine, eu nu credeam. M-am izolat complet. Chiar dacă încercam să schimb câte ceva, anxietatea mea, nesiguranța mea, erau de fiecare dată mai puternice decât dorința mea de a mă schimba. Medicamentele erau soluția.</p>

Hi! I’m Roma, 26, a fresh graduate of medicine and I have a dream!          Throughout my adult life I have endured a number of troubling issues, such as anxiety, agoraphobia, panic attacks, PVCs, caused by video game addiction, horrible time management, lack of ambition and the stressful lifestyle of a medical student.          I had to halt my studies for a year, and was fooling myself with medication to alleviate the constant strain headaches and PVCs. Video games became my oasis, a place where my mind could rest, at least for a while, but deep down I knew things were bleak, and I had no answer for how to get out of the mess that was my life at that point.         With the help of my girlfriend and my friend I managed to graduate from University and can proudly say, have almost been able to get rid of my self-destructive issues, by shifting my whole lifestyle. I feel as if I am close being burden free, but one last step remains for me, an item that has lasted long on my bucket list and, hopefully, with your help can be crossed of it. My dream is to run the marathon, namely the Haspa 42k Marathon in Hamburg, Germany on April 17, 2016!         The reason I have chosen that specific marathon in that specific location is because as of next year I start my Residency towards becoming a Neurologist and have the opportunity to do so in Germany. However, the first 3 months will be unpaid, and with the little funds I have remaining, the whole plan would be unfeasible.          This way I feel like your contribution will serve a dual-purpose: I will once and for all overcome my inner difficulties and finish a marathon, and also will use the knowledge I have gained over the years, both as an individual battling anxiety and agoraphobia, but also as a Neurologist, to aid people who have gone through what I have, and provide them with the drug free support and care that they need. My journey wouldn’t end there at the marathon! Next step till my 30s I will take the Ironman title. No more pills, no more panic!         Here is a graphic of how your contribution would be spent:         We will be glad to offer you little souvenirs from our country, by sending you perks for your contribution.

Questions
          Definitions were written consulting medical sources and regarding my personal experiences. This publication is personal, it doesn't encourage the use of a drug of those mentioned or promote the image of a particular pharmaceutical company!                   What is anxiety? - Anxiety is a strong feeling characterized by an unpleasant inner state, accompanied by nervousness, strange body sensations, intense expectation of future threat. It can be a normal feeling, something everyone experiences once in a while, but when experienced often and continuously the individual may suffer from an anxiety disorder. This in its turn can develop into agoraphobia or/and panic attacks.         What is panic attack? A panic attack (PA) is an extremely strong sudden fear for one's safeness, feeling intense body-mind sensations like heart palpitations, PVCs, chest pain, dizziness, shakiness, shortness of breath, accelerated heartbeat, having sensations of unreality, the most horrifying being the feeling of imminent death. Usually these emotions force a person to escape or flee the place where the attack began and in the future avoid this environment. Commonly when someone is having their first PA, they end up in the ER. It takes up to 20 min (my case) for it to pass, but it can reappear shortly if medication or proper autocontrol techniques are not used. However, medically speaking, PAs are not dangerous and do not lead to physical harm!          What is agoraphobia? Agoraphobia is an anxiety disorder where an individual perceives the environment to be dangerous, life threatening. This way simple social situations like football game, at work, shopping malls, movie-theatre, airports, bridges or even just walking around the corner of the house can easily set up an panic attack. This forces that person to avoid every place that triggered in the past unpleasant thoughts or sensations. In many cases the only panic free space is his/her own house, especially when there is someone who can oversee you.          What are PVCs? PVC - premature ventricular contractions (extrasystoles) are the skipped beats of the heart felt like palpitations, strong sudden beats, sensation of a suction in stomach or throat, or in many cases not felt at all. When related to anxiety, PVCs tend to occur as a cause of adrenalin rush, and a proper breathing-relaxation technique should be enough to stop them. However when someone is having a panic disorder, it’s quite hard to break the vicious cycle without medication, this way every single skipped beat is so terrifying and frightening like if you would have each and every time a heart attack.       What medication? I was taking Xanax (Alprazolam) for several years, though there were periods when I stayed in my comfort zone and was able to get rid of Xanax for a few days. But as soon as there was an exam or a medium stress event came up I was forced to take medication. Since 2015 I pushed myself to diminish Xanax intake from 5mg per month to 0,5 mg per month! Nowadays (August 2015) when I have severe headaches, because of emotional stress, I may take 0,12mg of Xanax but I am doing my best to do sports instead of taking pills. Take a look at my medication intake chart that I have been completing for the last 5 months. In 150 days I took only 2mg of Xanax, and soon, I wont be needing it at all! This publication is personal, it doesn't encourage the use of a drug of those mentioned or promote the image of a particular pharmaceutical company!         Why I had a stressful lifestyle? Back in 2010 I was doubting my future, I was unsure what I wanted to do in life, I quit  any sport I used to do, I no longer wanted to continue my medical studies, etc. I began to skip classes, arguing with my parents and girlfriend on trivial matters. I was still trying to lead an active life as a student, I was working as a surgical medical assistant at a hospital, participating in scientific researches, etc., but I was hoping that somehow University will be soon finished without me and everybody will leave me alone. This inner fight continued and grew bigger and bigger with every month. Starting with 2011 I started playing a computer game, and that became my only island of peace and safeness. However I perfectly understood at that moment that I am sinking in my pleasure and I am spiritually suiciding. But I had no power of will to change myself and change the way I saw the world. I started to ignore people, eveniments, classes, family .. everything, anyone. I remember myself back then as very nervous, easily annoyed and mad at everyone, especially at myself.This bomb slowly grew up to April 2012 when I had my first panic attack. It was as if a hammer hit me on the head, then  uncontrollable shaking, blurry vision and a constant feeling of fear. With the little medical knowledge I had at the time I thought I had a stroke. I was sure that something went wrong in my head and I was going to die. That day I ended up in the ER. Being so far from home, I started to panic, and even if I consulted doctors and made every possible medical investigation I still believed that there is something wrong with me. This is when I  began to take pills. I halted my studies for a year. Video games became my life. I started to have quite a lot PVCs, which became my most powerful panic attacks triggers. I thought I had a heart attack each and every time I had a skipped beat. I made even more medical investigations, and even if that proved everything was just fine, I didn't believe it. I completely isolated myself. Even though I was trying to change things my anxiety, my insecurity, was every time much greater than my wish to alter. Pills were my solution.          How I shifted my lifestyle? I felt guilty every time I took a pill. I was missing the freedom of walking alone. I was missing the gym, cycling, badminton, tennis that I used to do. I tried to make some workouts but PVCs stopped me everytime from doing them. Since summer 2013 I tried to do at least I could, but the fear of having PVCs or headache halted me anyway. With the support of my family I went back to studies. I had even more stress and anxiety. But the thought that this problem of mine could last for the rest of my life was killing me. My inner fight for freedom was winning, up until a severe panic attack. And then I tried again, and every time I failed. I’ve tried acupuncture for several times, I can’t say it made a big change. I had some psychoanalytic discussions. I tried to do at least some sort of physical exercises. At some point everything was in van. No major changes, same number of panic attacks or/and headaches or fear. I hated myself for whom I was. I was trying not to believe my senses but to trust my rational thinking. No matter how strange or scary my feelings were I began to think differently, to negate my senses! That was hard but that was my one way ticket, my only option. Then I tried to work with my thoughts, senses, feelings, to understand them, and finally.. to control them. Since 2015 I diminished 10 times my medication intake. I did that through sport, reading, dancing and other positive activities. To even accelerate my comeback I am doing each day at least one of following: calisthenics exercises, cycling, jogging or swimming and guess what, I am PVC free for 9 months. Lots of other complicated problems are awaiting me in life, I don’t how to solve them yet, that’s why I am not stopping here, I will fight every day to make the best out of my choices. You can take my ticket, its free.If you have any questions you can always contact me:Facebook: Roman CobiletchiIndiegogo: Roman CobiletchiRomâna
Salut! Sunt Roma, am 26 de ani, sunt proaspăt absolvent medicinist și vreau să vă povestesc despre visul meu!
          De la începutul maturității am trăit un șir întreg de senzații, precum anxietate, agorafobie, atacuri de panică, extrasistole, având drept cauze comune dependența de jocurile video, gestionarea ineficientă a timpului, lipsa de motivație și, pe lângă acestea, stilul de viață stresant al unui student la medicină.         Am fost nevoit să fac o pauză de un an de la studii și mă auto-amăgeam cu medicamente pentru atenuarea migrenelelor și extrasistolelor. Jocurile video au devenit refugiul meu, o lume unde mintea mea se putea relaxa, cel puțin pentru o scurtă perioadă, dar în subconștient știam că lucrurile nu stau bine și nu aveam nici cea mai vagă idee cum să scap de dezordinea de la acel moment din viața mea.         Cu ajutorul prietenei mele și al unui prieten, am reușit în cele din urmă să finisez universitatea și pot zice cu mândrie că aproape am scăpat de majoritatea problemelor mele auto-distructive, prin schimbarea radicală a modului meu de viață.  Simt că sunt aproape liber de această povară, dar mi-a mai ramas un pas important, un lucru pe care mi l-am dorit de foarte mult și sper că, cu ajutorul vostru, acesta va deveni realitate. Visul meu este să particip la maraton, și anume Maratonul Haspa 42k din Hamburg, Germania pe 17 Aprilie, 2016!          Motivul pentru care am ales anume acest specific maraton în această specifică locație este deoarece anul viitor voi începe să lucrez în calitate de medic-rezident în Neurologie și există oportunitatea să o fac în Germania. Unica problemă este că primele 3 luni nu vor fi salariate și deci, cu resursele financiare limitate, întregul plan nu ar fi realizabil.         Astfel, contribuțiile voastre ar servi unui dublu scop: voi trece odată și pentru totdeauna peste dificultățile mele interioare și voi alerga maratonul, dar cel mai important este că voi folosi cunoștințele acumulate pe parcursul ultimilor ani, din duelul meu personal cu anxietatea și atacurile de panică, dar și în calitate de Neurolog, pentru a ajuta persoanele care trec prin ceea ce am trecut eu și îî voi susține ne-medicamentos cu suportul de care au cu adevărat nevoie. Călătoria mea însă nu își va avea finișul la maraton! Următorul scop până la 30 de ani este titlul de Ironman (Omul de fier). Fără medicamente, fără panică!         Iată o reprezentare grafică a distribuției contribuțiilor voastre:        Vom fi bucuroși să îți oferim suvenire din țara noastră, expediindu-ți cadouri pentru contribuție.Întrebări         Definițiile au fost scrise consultând surse medicale și referindu-mă la experiența personală. Aceasta publicație este personală, nu încurajează utilizarea unui medicament din cele menționate și nu promovează imaginea unei anume firme farmaceutice!          
         Ce este anxietatea? - Anxietatea este o senzație puternică caracterizată printr-o stare internă neplacută, însoțită de nervozitate, senzații ciudate prin corp, impresie de pericol iminent. Poate fi o trăire normală, pe care fiecare o poate simți uneori, dar când devine frecventă și continuă, persoana poate suferi de tulburare de anxietate. Aceasta, la rândul ei, se poate dezvolta în agorafobie și/sau atacuri de panică.         Ce este un atac de panică? Un atac de panică (AP) este o frică extrem de puternică apărută brusc, însoțită de senzații psiho-somatice, precum palpitații, extrasistole, durere toracică, amețeli, tremur, respirație îngreunată, ritm cardiac accelerat, senzații de irealitate, iar cel mai înspăimântător este sentimentul morții iminente. De obicei aceste trăiri forțează persoana să evadeze din locul unde atacul de panică a început și să îl evite chiar pe viitor. Adesea, când cineva are pentru prima dată un atac de panică, ajunge să se adreseze la Urgență. Durează până la 20 minute (în cazul meu), dar poate să reapară în scurt timp, dacă nu se administrează nici un medicament sau nu se efectuează tehnici de auto-control. Totuși, din punct de vedere medical, atacurile de panică nu sunt periculoase și nu aduc nici o daună fizică organismului!
          Ce este agorafobia? Agorafobia este o tulburare de anxietate, în care persoana percepe mediul ambiant drept periculos, amenințător pentru viață. Situații de viață cu adevărat inofensive cum ar fi jocurile de fotbal, locul de la serviciu, magazinele, cinematografele, aeroporturile, podurile sau chiar plimbările prin cartier ar putea cu ușurință declanșa un atac de panică. Aceasta forțează persoana să evite orice locație care anterior a generat gânduri sau senzații neplăcute. Adesea, unicul spațiu cu risc scăzut de a porni un atac de panică rămâne propria locuință, în special dacă acolo mai este cineva care te supraveghează.
          Ce sunt extrasistolele? Extrasistola - este o contracție ventriculară prematură, care este simțită precum palpitație, bătaie puternică subită, senzație de constrângere în stomac sau gât, sau adesea nu este simțită deloc. Când se referă la anxietate, extrasistolele apar din cauza unui flux masiv de adrenalină, iar o tehnică respiratorie adecvată de relaxare ar fi trebuit să fie suficientă pentru a le opri. Totuși, când cineva are atacuri de panică, este destul de dificil de rupt acest cerc vicios fără medicație, în acest fel fiecare bătaie de cord este atât de înspăimântătoare și deranjantă, de parcă ai suferi de fiecare dată un infarct miocardic.
          Care medicamente? Eu am luat Xanax (Alprazolam) timp de mai mulți ani, totuși existau perioade când rămâneam în zona mea de confort și reușeam să scap de Xanax pe câteva zile. Dar cum un examen sau un stres de intensitate medie apăreau, eram din nou forțat să iau medicamentul. Începând cu 2015, m-am obligat să scad doza de Xanax de la 5 mg pe lună la 0,5 mg pe lună. Acum (august 2015), când am o durere de cap puternică din cauza unui stres emoțional, aș putea să iau 0,12 mg de Xanax, dar încerc să fac sport în loc. Priviți la reprezentarea grafică cu medicamentele administrate timp de ultimele 5 luni. Timp de 150 zile am luat doar 2mg de Xanax, iar curând nu voi mai avea deloc nevoie de el!
                   Aceasta publicație este personală, nu încurajează utilizarea unui medicament din cele menționate și nu promovează imaginea unei anume firme farmaceutice!
          De ce am avut un stil de viață stresant? În 2010 îmi puneam la îndoială viitorul, nu eram sigur ce vreau să fac în viață, am încetat să practic orice sport, nu mai vroiam să îmi continui studiile medicale, etc. Am început să nu frecventez cursurile, certându-mă cu părinții și prietena pe probleme banale.

<p>Existing smartwatches are geeky accessories instead
of the wristwatch that every smartphone owner would want to wear.</p>
<p>For a smartwatch to make sense, it shouldn't just be
a smaller smartphone. Instead, it actually needs to be better than the smartphone
for the tasks you are going to use it for. You are not going to write an email
on your watch, but you are going to check the weather on it - because that's
something you want to do on-the-go. So it needs to be optimized for these
simple tasks being executed in a moving environment - in contrast to current
smartphone interfaces, which are made for increasingly complex tasks.</p><p><br/></p><h1>Features

fashion statement and you actually wear it on your arm for most of the day so
that people see it. It's much more intimate than a phone and shouldn't look
like a gadget, but like an actual wristwatch.</p>
<p>Attention to detail and premium materials are the
main characteristics for the watch. Screen is protected by a dome shaped crystal
sapphire which is known for its strong ability to endure scratches and provide
clear visibility.</p>
<p>The watch body is offered in three options: brushed
stainless steel, titanium and rose gold to match every taste and offer
sufficient protection for the watch. The ZAMMANN watch weights 86 grams (68
grams for the titanium model) which feels so light yet very solid.</p>
<p>We decided not to include a microphone or a speaker or any open ports so we can ensure the product is water-tight and robust for many years.</p>

The screen is touch capacitive so you can simply swipe through different menus and apps.</p><p>The smartwatch case design also incorporates 1 crown and 2 physical buttons that add to the aesthetics of a classical wristwatch. To adjust time, you simply pull the crown and rotate, just like a normal watch! The other 2 buttons can be easily customized to perform various functions like; timer, stopwatch, missed notifications, change watch face, alarm, turn volume up/down and many more!</p><p>With the built-in accelerometer and gyroscope you can simply shake your wrist to turn on the back-light when in dark situations.</p><br/><p></p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/344204/files/20140202012602-buttons.png?1391333162"" src="""" style=""""/><p></p><br/><p></p><p></p><p></p>

<b>Ap</b><b>ps &amp; Notifications</b>
</h1>
<p>Notifications are an important
part of the smartwatch, because much too often, we pull our phones out only to
check the notification we just got.</p>
<p>When you get a new notification,
the smartwatch vibrates and the notification fills the screen for a few
seconds, allowing you to look at it and go back to what you were doing without
further interaction. Of course, you can also swipe them away to get rid of them
immediately or interact on them. Vibration pattern and intensity can be
customized and assigned to different types of notifications and alerts.</p>
<p>Additionally, if you decide that
a notification requires more complex interaction (like reading a long email),
you can just unlock your phone and it'll immediately open the notification's
app for you. Missed notifications are indicated by simple icons on the main

wrist
Existing smartwatches are geeky accessories instead
of the wristwatch that every smartphone owner would want to wear.
For a smartwatch to make sense, it shouldn't just be
a smaller smartphone. Instead, it actually needs to be better than the smartphone
for the tasks you are going to use it for. You are not going to write an email
on your watch, but you are going to check the weather on it - because that's
something you want to do on-the-go. So it needs to be optimized for these
simple tasks being executed in a moving environment - in contrast to current
smartphone interfaces, which are made for increasingly complex tasks.Features

DesignA watch is much more personal than a phone. It's a
fashion statement and you actually wear it on your arm for most of the day so
that people see it. It's much more intimate than a phone and shouldn't look
like a gadget, but like an actual wristwatch.
Attention to detail and premium materials are the
main characteristics for the watch. Screen is protected by a dome shaped crystal
sapphire which is known for its strong ability to endure scratches and provide
clear visibility.
The watch body is offered in three options: brushed
stainless steel, titanium and rose gold to match every taste and offer
sufficient protection for the watch. The ZAMMANN watch weights 86 grams (68
grams for the titanium model) which feels so light yet very solid.
We decided not to include a microphone or a speaker or any open ports so we can ensure the product is water-tight and robust for many years.
Dimensions and physical specifications:Case size: 43 mmCase thickness: 14.2 mmCase materials: Stainless Steel / Rose Gold / TitaniumWatch lens: Crystal Sapphire GlassBand type: LeatherWatch case back: Screw downWater resistance: 5 ATMUser Interface & ConvenienceThe ZAMMANN smartwatch can be operated simply by; touching, pushing and shaking. The screen is touch capacitive so you can simply swipe through different menus and apps.The smartwatch case design also incorporates 1 crown and 2 physical buttons that add to the aesthetics of a classical wristwatch. To adjust time, you simply pull the crown and rotate, just like a normal watch! The other 2 buttons can be easily customized to perform various functions like; timer, stopwatch, missed notifications, change watch face, alarm, turn volume up/down and many more!With the built-in accelerometer and gyroscope you can simply shake your wrist to turn on the back-light when in dark situations.

Apps & Notifications

Notifications are an important
part of the smartwatch, because much too often, we pull our phones out only to
check the notification we just got.
When you get a new notification,
the smartwatch vibrates and the notification fills the screen for a few
seconds, allowing you to look at it and go back to what you were doing without
further interaction. Of course, you can also swipe them away to get rid of them
immediately or interact on them. Vibration pattern and intensity can be
customized and assigned to different types of notifications and alerts.
Additionally, if you decide that
a notification requires more complex interaction (like reading a long email),
you can just unlock your phone and it'll immediately open the notification's
app for you. Missed notifications are indicated by simple icons on the main
watch face.

Customization
The ZAMMANN smartwatch comes
preloaded with numerous watch faces to match your need and style; Digital,
analog, classical, sport, chronograph, modern, minimal … the sky is the limit!
You can change the watch faces directly from the watch or from the installed ZAMMANN
Watch Manager on your smartphone. It will also allow users to design their own
watch faces and upload/share with a wide community of watch enthusiasts.
The stainless steel version comes
with an Italian buffalo grain black leather strap; the rose gold version comes
with an Italian crocodile pattern brown leather and rose gold buckle. However,
if you’re in a mood to change, the strap can be easily replaced with standard
sized straps and bands.                       
DisplayThe ZAMMANN smartwatch incorporates the latest technology in Mirasol™IMOD display that offers vibrant colors and easily viewed in direct sunlight just like paper and E-Ink displays. The display is backlit for when there is no outside light source.Interferometric Modulator Display (IMOD, trademarked Mirasol) is a technology used in electronic visual displays that can create various colors via interference of reflected light.

<p>""I can't."" ""I don't know how."" ""I'll never be able to accomplish that.""</p>
<p>Those were thoughts that ran through my head for years. I didn't believe that I could accomplish anything more than I already had. When I hit my lowest point, I discovered photography. <br/>
</p>
<p>I was depressed and broke so, I decided to sell some of my clothes on Etsy...I didn't have enough to make rent that month. At first, I took pics of my clothes on hangers with a basic point and shoot. I didn't find the images appealing. So, I convinced my Mom to let me buy a Canon T2i with her Best Buy card. Then, I found a model online (pretending that I had experience as a photographer, when in actuality - I had none). During that first shoot, I began to feel like a creative person again...and it felt really, really, really Good. From there, I posted the images online, with the sole purpose of finding more models for my Etsy shop...but, then agencies started contacting me to shoot their models. I still didn't think of myself as a photographer but, I was flattered, nervous, and excited about this new challenge. </p>
<p>And that's how I started. A year later, I moved to New York.</p>
<p>In the 2 years since I left Chicago, I've moved 13 times. I've survived on ramen for months at a time. I've crashed on couches and box springs and air mattresses, when I had no money and only the kindness of friends to keep a roof over my head. But, despite the initial hardship of my New York Story - I'd never felt more fulfilled in my life. That's because throughout the struggle, I was doing what I loved. The 2nd week after I arrived, I shot my first male model (Tristan Burnett), and I was stunned at how strong and emotional and tangible my images came out. Working with him was much different than when I had worked with women. During that shoot, I discovered that I really love shooting men. And in that moment I knew that capturing them would be my focus. And it has been.</p>

<h3>THE MAGAZINE</h3>
<p>For many reasons, SCRUGGS is unique and ceiling shattering.  To give you context, most of the photographer's who shoot major fashion editorials and campaigns are white and male.  There are a select group of female photographers who are shooting high level projects but, as far as I know - none of them are black.</p>
<p>The fact that I'm Black and  Female and a Photographer, who's main focus is on shooting Men (when most female photographers usually shoot other women), is incredibly significant. And the fact that I am at the helm of my own magazine, that I've photographed 100% of the content for, and that will be competing on newsstands with the biggest fashion magazines being published today - is even more significant. Yes, SCRUGGS will be sold on newsstands and in shops around country - and around the world.</p>This magazine's extra-ordinary background will make an impact on the industry.
<p><br/></p>
<p>But, all of these words would be meaningless if I didn't have the talent and the vision to back them up...and I have both. My work is about capturing more than just the fashion aspect of an image. I view the models that I shoot as more than just a ""hanger"". That's why I push them and myself to create images that have an emotional gravity, interesting lines, and physical agility. 

</p>
<p>Those hallmarks of my style have garnered me opportunities to shoot for Details Magazine, Footlocker, and GQ South Africa. I've also cut my editorial teeth shooting for great independent magazine's like GODS, Tabula Rasa, and Creem. </p>
<p>At this point, I'm ready and able to take my work to the Next Level. I've already shot 80% of the issue, with models that have given me so much inspiration. I've pushed myself beyond what I thought that I was capable of and I'm incredibly proud of the results. Please scroll for a preview of what's to come:</p>

""I can't."" ""I don't know how."" ""I'll never be able to accomplish that.""
Those were thoughts that ran through my head for years. I didn't believe that I could accomplish anything more than I already had. When I hit my lowest point, I discovered photography. 

I was depressed and broke so, I decided to sell some of my clothes on Etsy...I didn't have enough to make rent that month. At first, I took pics of my clothes on hangers with a basic point and shoot. I didn't find the images appealing. So, I convinced my Mom to let me buy a Canon T2i with her Best Buy card. Then, I found a model online (pretending that I had experience as a photographer, when in actuality - I had none). During that first shoot, I began to feel like a creative person again...and it felt really, really, really Good. From there, I posted the images online, with the sole purpose of finding more models for my Etsy shop...but, then agencies started contacting me to shoot their models. I still didn't think of myself as a photographer but, I was flattered, nervous, and excited about this new challenge. 
And that's how I started. A year later, I moved to New York.
In the 2 years since I left Chicago, I've moved 13 times. I've survived on ramen for months at a time. I've crashed on couches and box springs and air mattresses, when I had no money and only the kindness of friends to keep a roof over my head.

</h3><p>   Not only will there be no gases involved in the use, but the stainless steel will be strong enough to support the heat from the laser, while not heating the stainless steel to the point when toxic vapors can be released. This is a concern for most vaporizers, where the device is heated to the point where fragments of metal may be inhaled by the user.</p><br/><p><b><u>Will the Blazzar Vape be durable?</u></b></p><p>   YES! We are buying durable (thus expensive) parts for the Blazzar to guarantee a reliable portable vape that can be used more often and not ruin due to usage. We are striving to make a portable vaporizer that will stand the test of time. </p><br/><p><b><u>Will the laser be powerful enough for my needs?</u></b></p><p>   Whether herb or oil, the laser will be powerful enough for flexible vaping needs, while having an adjustable power level dial. Letting you control the heat output of the laser depending on the substance that you are loading and the vaporization experience you desire!</p><br/><p><b><u>Why should I buy this product over other Portable Vapes? </u></b></p><p>   Not only will the Blazzar Vape be the first of its kind on the market, but we believe it is the most durable and efficient vaporizer between usages. We plan to sell our product for a reasonable price for the power and durability. </p><p><br/></p><p><b><u>Is the Blazzar Vape safe?</u></b></p><p>   We will be installing safety measures to prevent the laser from activating while the chamber is unattached. We will be going through the FDA for approval of safe usage. This device has been designed with ease of use as well as ease of cleaning in mind.</p><div><br/></div><p><b><u>How much will the Blazzar Vape be?</u></b></p><p>   We want our product to be the best on the market, while maintaining affordability! The Blazzar will be available for $250 USD.</p><div><br/></div><p><b><u>Where is Blazzar from?</u></b></p><p>   We are based in Austin, Texas! We designed this product with the end user in mind.

We will replace any unlikely faulty circuitry or non-working components for 1 year after purchase. Just ship it to our location and we will repair or replace your product while returning it to you for free of charge.</p><br/><p><b><u>Is Blazzar only going to have one colored laser and device?</u></b></p><p>   We plan to make special orders in the future dealing with varied laser colors, but red is what we will be using for the base design. The red color is at a lower wavelength frequency, thus better suited towards transmitting heat. We can use other colors, but they are not as efficient as red when dealing heat.</p><br/><p><b><u>Will they be sold online? </u></b></p><p>   Yes, from distributors as well as through our website. Please feel free to refer to our website and/or social networks to read and find out more. We'll keep you posted on all future updates!</p><br/><p><b><u>Why only one laser? </u></b></p><p>   One strong laser will be sufficient . Multiple lasers would require more power usage and would be more expensive to manufacture. Due to the bowl being slightly dome shaped, everything will vape evenly towards the center, down into the chamber. </p><br/><p><b><u>How will the vape work?</u></b></p><p>   The unit will be operational with a fully charged battery. There is an adjustable power level control dial. Detach the chamber compartment connected to the casing. Then load personal herb or oil into the chamber. Attach the chamber back to the casing, then temporarily hold down the button in order to heat the substance that was loaded. Then inhale through the mouthpiece.</p><br/><p><b><u>What is the charge time?</u></b></p><p>   We will be working towards better charge times versus usage time. Currently, the charge <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">will roughly be about 3 to 5 hours (from a completely dead battery) with approximately 1 and 30 minutes of continuous usage.</span></p><br/><p><u><b>How big is the vape?</b></u></p><p>   The design will be going through a very vigorous redesign phase. Right now the design is fully functional, although not fully optimized in beauty, safety and efficiency of vaping. The design is based on a 6 ½ inch ( 16.5 cm) size. Improvements can and will be made to reduce the size where possible while adding comfort and elegance.</p><br/><p><b><u>Can it be used while charging?</u></b></p><p>   Yes!</p><br/><p><b><u>Will the vape overheat at all?</u></b></p><p>   The distribution of heat would be sufficient enough to allow a safe hit. Always make sure the chamber is loaded before use to ensure you don't heat the metal up directly. Even so, it would not be harmful to the device.</p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">   </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Since the heat is directly beamed into the chamber, it allows for the substance to be heated directly without extensive heating to the interior atmosphere. Which can spread throughout the device causing discomfort to the touch or even damage precious circuitry.</span></p><br/><p><b><u>How do I clean my vape?</u></b></p><p>   A full disassembly of the casing would be possible for a deep clean. Sufficient cleaning would be possible with a pipe cleaner and alcohol wipes.</p><br/><p><b><u>How long will development take?</u></b></p><p>   The core team is small and we will be working with developers and manufacturers here in Texas and in California to bring you the best product as soon as possible. The developmental process of prototyping, FDA approval, and manufacturing  is estimated to take about 4-6 months. </p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><b><u>Why do you need funding?</u></b></p><p>   Although the design is functional, it's by no means perfect. The funding will help us take this to the next level of design (for efficiency, elegance, and safety) and help with the cost of manufacturing. We truly believe this is the next BIG step in vaping. With the proper funding, we'll be able to make the Blazzar the best (and yes, we're striving to be the <u>BEST</u>) vaporizer on the market. To do so, we require your help and support. </p><p><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1025341/files/20141118023438-Blazzar_Display_Render_Small.png?1416306878"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><div>

Due to the bowl being slightly dome shaped, everything will vape evenly towards the center, down into the chamber. How will the vape work?   The unit will be operational with a fully charged battery. There is an adjustable power level control dial. Detach the chamber compartment connected to the casing. Then load personal herb or oil into the chamber. Attach the chamber back to the casing, then temporarily hold down the button in order to heat the substance that was loaded. Then inhale through the mouthpiece.What is the charge time?   We will be working towards better charge times versus usage time. Currently, the charge will roughly be about 3 to 5 hours (from a completely dead battery) with approximately 1 and 30 minutes of continuous usage.How big is the vape?   The design will be going through a very vigorous redesign phase. Right now the design is fully functional, although not fully optimized in beauty, safety and efficiency of vaping. The design is based on a 6 ½ inch ( 16.5 cm) size. Improvements can and will be made to reduce the size where possible while adding comfort and elegance.Can it be used while charging?   Yes!Will the vape overheat at all?   The distribution of heat would be sufficient enough to allow a safe hit. Always make sure the chamber is loaded before use to ensure you don't heat the metal up directly. Even so, it would not be harmful to the device.   Since the heat is directly beamed into the chamber, it allows for the substance to be heated directly without extensive heating to the interior atmosphere. Which can spread throughout the device causing discomfort to the touch or even damage precious circuitry.How do I clean my vape?   A full disassembly of the casing would be possible for a deep clean. Sufficient cleaning would be possible with a pipe cleaner and alcohol wipes.How long will development take?   The core team is small and we will be working with developers and manufacturers here in Texas and in California to bring you the best product as soon as possible. The developmental process of prototyping, FDA approval, and manufacturing  is estimated to take about 4-6 months. Why do you need funding?   Although the design is functional, it's by no means perfect. The funding will help us take this to the next level of design (for efficiency, elegance, and safety) and help with the cost of manufacturing. We truly believe this is the next BIG step in vaping. With the proper funding, we'll be able to make the Blazzar the best (and yes, we're striving to be the BEST) vaporizer on the market. To do so, we require your help and support.

One, while we had a recently successful Kickstarter campaign, they didn't let us share our key inspiration behind THINX, and two, after hearing from so many of you, we learned that there were a few specific things you guys would like to see us create.<strong><strong><br/></strong></strong>
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>So here's the deal!<strong><strong><br/></strong></strong>
<h3 dir=""ltr""><span>Exciting reason #1 - Now we can tell the whole story when we couldn't with Kickstarter (they don't allow cause-based funding):</span></h3>
<p>The full story of why we created THINX has two parts.</p>
<p>One, THINX took almost 3 years to develop, and it is the smartest, best-in-class, leak and stain-resistant underwear that thinks of you every day of the month (did we mention that it's anti-microbial, moisture-wicking, comfortable and pretty too?). </p>
<p>Two, THINX is also the most thoughtful pair because it thinks about women and girls in the developing world thru a partnership in Uganda. </p>
<p><em>Here's what a few of the styles look like (""THINX Classics Trio"" reward pictured):</em> </p>

<p dir=""ltr""><span>For instance, girls in the developing world are missing up to a week of school every month and using unimaginable things to manage their monthly cycle like twigs, leaves, newspaper, plastic bags or dirty rags. In the developing world, more than 67 million girls have dropped out of school entirely which overwhelmingly leads to early marriage, pregnancy and a greater difficulty in raising themselves out of poverty.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>To help change this, every time you buy a pair of THINX you also help fund the production of 7 washable, reusable pads for a woman or girl in the developing world via our partnership with AFRIpads in Uganda.</span></p>

Why we ran an Indiegogo Campaign
On March 19, 2013, we won a competition with The Grommet (www.grommet.com) and Google Apps, and as a result, we were asked to do a campaign on Indiegogo! We're so excited about this for two main reasons.

I am in seventh grade, and I love fashion.  As the weather gets colder, I realize how lucky I am to have warm clothes. I’m also aware that others are not as fortunate. 

Hats are my favorite accessory. They are fashionable and provide great warmth in the winter. Since approximately 30% of your heat loss goes through your head, it is very important to keep it covered. By purchasing one of my hats, you will also be providing a hat for someone in need.

For every hat that you purchase, I will donate a hat to a local homeless shelter. The hats come in three designs: 
 

communiKate
eduKate
dediKate



I selected these words because I think they are important to making the world a better place. If we all communiKate, we can understand each other better.  It is important to eduKate yourself in order to make good decisions, and to eduKate those around you by providing a good example for them.  And if you dediKate yourself to your goals, you can overcome challenges and be successful.  So, if you communiKate, eduKate, and dediKate, you and the world around you will benefit!
I hope that over the upcoming winter months, I see many people wearing my hats.  It would be a great success if I did. I will be so happy (and you will too) knowing that for each person I see wearing my hat, there is another person out there, who I do not know, but who is also wearing one and staying warm because of your help.  

Please spread the word about KATe IN THE HAT.  The more hats I sell, the more people will be warm. Post a picture on Instagram or Tweet about it with #KATeINTHEHAT

Thank you so much for your help!   Let’s make a difference together! 

xo Kate
P.S.  Special thanks to Perfect Trading Company for helping me to produce the hats!

<p>My name is Emma O’Rourke and I
am an emerging designer from Canberra, Australia. I created THE LABEL in 2015
after completing my Bachelor’s Degree. Through several years of study, I learnt
about many of the negative impacts the fashion industry has. It taught me there
is a need for emerging designs to not only focus on concept and aesthetics,
but the need to consider impact, sustainability and ethics. I have created a
label that embodies my drive, my creativity and my determination for an ethical
and sustainable fashion industry. </p>
<p>I received my invitation to
attend Vancouver Fashion Week in April. My project is bigger than just the final product; THE LABEL is about
design, concept, process and commitment to a cause and culture.  My vision is to see a world that thrives on
creativity without harm, and success without compromising on value. Each
contribution will go towards my registration fee and help me promote THE

global apparel industry is an industry that has given rise to a vast range of
talented individuals. It has also, unfortunately, proved extremely damaging to
the planet and the lives of so many of the 57.8 million people who work within it,

<p>By

Rather than bring yet another minimalist sneaker to market, we set out to create a real footwear solution for today's man. By merging the comfort and wearability of a sneaker with the sensibility of a dress shoe we have created something that looks dressy but wears like a sneaker.Our brand is about blurring the lines between convention and expression in order to create comfortable yet versatile shoes that can be worn for both business and pleasure. We make shoes for the entrepreneur, the creative and the modern professional - sneakers that are  great looking, multi-purpose, super comfortable and premium quality.We have streamlined our offering to cover your wardrobe essentials and added a patent leather version for tuxedos (or ripped up jeans and a leather jacket). Monk Strap Unlocked! Available in Black, Chocolate Brown and Oxblood.Be sure to check the bottom of the page for larger images and styling advice for each colour. The Tuxedo SneakerWhat if you could covertly wear a pair of sneakers to work with your suit? And what if you could wear that same pair of sneakers after hours and not look like you just left your suit at work?Business | CasualWe have designed the Windsor sneaker to simplify your life.  Enabling you to leave your uncomfortable dress shoes at home yet still look professional at work. And when the weekend rolls around, they pair seamlessly with your favourite jeans.Imagine travelling with everything you need for business and pleasure without wasting valuable time waiting for that extra bag to come off the baggage carousel.  We all know that packing multiple pairs of shoes can be problematic because they take up precious space in your luggage. So what if you could pack your bag for business and pleasure with only 1 pair of shoes?  Business and PleasureThe Windsor comes fully equipped with a removable dense foam insole. Designed for maximum comfort, it will mould to the shape of your foot over time. However, if you require an orthotic our insoles easily slide out so you can comfortably wear the shoe without compromising your health or safety. No more sizing up or hoping the shoe will stretch enough to be comfortable.To achieve this type of versatility in a sneaker we had to make a couple of changes to the traditional silhouette. A regular sneaker vs. the WindsorStarting from the ground up, the first change we made was to the sole. Rather than use the same sole that every other sneaker company uses, we selected one with a slightly tapered toe. The taper not only references the silhouette of a fine dress shoe but also nicely complements modern menswear silhouettes. Next we reduced the number of laces to give the shoe a clean profile. And as a finishing touch we added an elegant perforated medallion to the toe.  All of our leathers are sourced from the best Italian tanneries and the shoes manufactured byartisanal, family-owned factories in Portugal's shoe corridor.

<p>Here's what happened, I've had a long standing interest in eyewear and sustainable materials. Bamboo, growing at almost 3 feet per day, is probably the most sustainable product available so I set about to make some ""sustainable style"" for myself. It proved trickier than first imagined, but I got my pair of new shades. </p>
<p>When friends said they wanted a pair too, I set about figuring how to get shades for all. Getting a production run made is expensive (about 10K all together). We've got the manufacturing partner all set up and want to get Bamboo Eyewear to everyone. Here's a chance to be a ""founder"", and get a great pair of shades cheap (we've spoken with retailers and they'll go for $90 in stores, and that's just the base model).</p>
<p>""Crowdfunding""was suggested as a means of inviting my friends and the rest of the world to help get a small biz off the ground. We've set a modest goal to offset some of the production run and ensure everyone can get a pair before they are in shops. </p>
<p>In return for your contribution we've got 'perks'! Ranging from 'props' to a pair cool shades and cases just in time for summer. Four styles, two stains, three lenses (including Polarized!). If you support, let us know your preferred style, colour and lens. We'll do our best to get you your first choice.  </p>
<p>Thanks for you consideration.</p>

The summary is that POLARIZED LENSES are $10 extra, BAMBOO CASE another $10 and SHIPPING in CANADA starts at $14 (it's a 'package', if you're INTERNATIONAL we can work something out). </p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">Necesitamos tu colaboración para luchar contra la eliminación de los plásticos que terminan en nuestras costas. Somos un equipo de tres jóvenes emprendedores que encontramos la solución para dar una segunda vida útil a estos residuos plásticos. Las siguientes generaciones sufrirán las consecuencias de esta nueva crisis ambiental si no reaccionamos AHORA. ¡Vivir en un ambiente sano es posible: de nosotros depende!</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">SEA SOCIETY. fue fundada por Alex Peña, Pep Generó y Laia Xu en Barcelona con el principal objetivo de convertir su pasión, la moda, para crear un mundo más sostenible y generar consciencia de cambio. De aquí proviene el nombre del proyecto, pretendemos formar una comunidad solidaria para promover el cambio.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Todo empezó cuando nos cruzamos y empezamos a estudiar nuestra carrera LEINN (Liderazgo, Emprendimiento e Innovación), Dicho título se basa en tres fundamentos: aprender haciendo, emprender en equipo y viajes de aprendizaje internacionales.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>

<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Además, como parte de la carrera, dirigimos una empresa sin ánimo de lucro creada por nosotros, donde desarrollamos proyectos empresariales reales, y como socios, compartimos el objetivo de resolver problemas ambientales y sociales que llevamos tiempo sufriendo, y cada vez son más visibles, de aquí surgió, nuestro proyecto de moda sostenible.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Empezamos a pensar que podíamos hacer para dar el primer paso de la aceleración del proceso de transformación hacia la sostenibilidad. Además de decidir que nuestra iniciativa tenia que estar relacionada con la moda, el mar y la sostenibilidad, y por ello, a parte de vender un producto sostenible, nuestra visión es hacer varios eventos relacionados con la sostenibilidad para generar una comunidad que este involucrada y impulsar el cambio. Pretendemos “concienciar con acciones” y ya estamos sobre la marcha, organizando puntos de recogida de plásticos.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">Nuestros bañadores hechos a partir de botellas de plástico reciclado post consumo han sido creados en base a la lucha contra la grave situación en la que nos encontramos.

Nacemos con una clara misión en mente: crear una alternativa de moda de baño fabricada a partir de tejidos 100% reciclados. Nuestros productos son para hombre pero no descartamos la introducción en la moda femenina en un futuro. 
 

En Sea Society no podemos hacerlo solos.
Necesitamos tu colaboración para luchar contra la eliminación de los plásticos que terminan en nuestras costas. Somos un equipo de tres jóvenes emprendedores que encontramos la solución para dar una segunda vida útil a estos residuos plásticos. Las siguientes generaciones sufrirán las consecuencias de esta nueva crisis ambiental si no reaccionamos AHORA. ¡Vivir en un ambiente sano es posible: de nosotros depende!
¿Quieres formar parte del cambio?
¡Únete a Sea Society.!
 
¿CUÁL ES NUESTRA HISTORIA?
 
SEA SOCIETY. fue fundada por Alex Peña, Pep Generó y Laia Xu en Barcelona con el principal objetivo de convertir su pasión, la moda, para crear un mundo más sostenible y generar consciencia de cambio. De aquí proviene el nombre del proyecto, pretendemos formar una comunidad solidaria para promover el cambio.
 
Todo empezó cuando nos cruzamos y empezamos a estudiar nuestra carrera LEINN (Liderazgo, Emprendimiento e Innovación), Dicho título se basa en tres fundamentos: aprender haciendo, emprender en equipo y viajes de aprendizaje internacionales.
 

 
Además, como parte de la carrera, dirigimos una empresa sin ánimo de lucro creada por nosotros, donde desarrollamos proyectos empresariales reales, y como socios, compartimos el objetivo de resolver problemas ambientales y sociales que llevamos tiempo sufriendo, y cada vez son más visibles, de aquí surgió, nuestro proyecto de moda sostenible.
 
Empezamos a pensar que podíamos hacer para dar el primer paso de la aceleración del proceso de transformación hacia la sostenibilidad. Además de decidir que nuestra iniciativa tenia que estar relacionada con la moda, el mar y la sostenibilidad, y por ello, a parte de vender un producto sostenible, nuestra visión es hacer varios eventos relacionados con la sostenibilidad para generar una comunidad que este involucrada y impulsar el cambio. Pretendemos “concienciar con acciones” y ya estamos sobre la marcha, organizando puntos de recogida de plásticos.
 
NUESTROS PRODUCTOS 
 
Porque sabemos que queréis algo diferente, nuestros bañadores están diseñados con detalle, contamos con un patrón índico que se adapta perfectamente al estilismo masculino. Con cada uno de nuestros bañadores, estás ayudando a limpiar nuestros océanos, además de apostar por la moda ética y sostenible. 
Nuestros bañadores hechos a partir de botellas de plástico reciclado post consumo han sido creados en base a la lucha contra la grave situación en la que nos encontramos. De esta manera, queremos ser recordados como una empresa que ha contribuido en lo posible al cambio hacia un mundo más sostenible.
En esta campaña, hemos incluido 2 diseños chulísimos de nuestra colección. Sea Society. pone su sello en dos diseños básicos depurados de estilo casual.
BAÑADOR MELVA 
Bañador azul marino con el logo de Sea Society. Elaborado a partir de botellas de plástico encontradas en el mar, se procesan para convertirse en ecoyarn 100% reciclado.  Este proceso ahorra agua y energía, reduciendo así las emisiones de gas de efecto invernadero.
BAÑADOR PARGO
Bañador rojo con el logo de Sea Society. Elaborado a partir de botellas de plástico encontradas en el mar, se procesan para convertirse en ecoyarn 100% reciclado.  Este proceso ahorra agua y energía, reduciendo así las emisiones de gas de efecto invernadero.

 
TALLAS
 

 
EL PROCESO
1) Nosotros y nuestra comunidad recojemos plástico de las playas.
2) El plástico se limpia y separa. Una vez limpias, se trocean. 
3) Una vez tenemos el plástico troceado lo derretimos y lo convertimos en pepitas.
4) A través de un proceso de extrusión y texturizado, conseguimos crear un hilo de alta calidad de 100% plástico reciclado.

<p><b>Our Bikini Story</b></p>
<p>After 10 years of looking for the perfect bikini, I did not find one that flattered or complemented my body. Often the briefs were cut for women who did not have a bigger belly, which meant that it did not cover me well or stay up with movement. It was uncomfortable and often embarrassing to constantly be moving it around. </p>
<p>Therefore I decided I had to fix this by creating a range of bikinis designed for curve and plus-size women. Girl Got Curves bikinis are designed for women who want innovative sizing with a comfortable fit, that combines the latest quality swimwear fabric to provide lightweight and outstanding support.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1525296188/du2horn74c15uwcpasxk.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

</div><div>
<p><strong>The Bikinis</strong></p>
<p>The Girl Got Curves bikini brief has been designed to flatter, highlight and enhance your curves. The mid-waist cut and wider waist band makes you feel covered in the right places and stops the need to rearrange the brief. We have carefully placed ruching in the centre to enhance your natural shape. The top of the brief is fashionable and on-trend with a V shape, while the bottom is a Brazilian cut which shows off your curves. </p>
<p>Our bikini tops have been designed with larger cup sizes in mind to ensure full coverage but keeping a fashionable look. Our tops can be tied in two ways, either traditional halter neck or, for comfortable all day wearing for larger cups, it can be tied in a 'bra' style.</p>
<p>Our bikinis tops come in two styles: </p>
<ul>
<li>A Single strap traditional look available in red, black and white </li>
<li>A Double strap for a more exciting look available in pink and blue</li>
</ul>
<p>We make one style of brief designed to match and compliment both tops. Briefs are available in all colours so you can mix &amp; match.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Our Mission</strong></p>
<p>Girl Got Curves wants to give women the confidence to wear a bikini, no matter their size or shape. Like us, we want women to love their bodies and feel comfortable showing them off on holiday, knowing that our bikinis are designed around strong women with real bodies. After speaking to over 200 women about their bikini choices, or rather the lack of them, we understood their reality and their need for a well-fitting, fashionable bikini.</p>
<p>Often bikinis made for plus-size women are high-wasted, designed to cover the entire tummy area. Although we understand this is some women's preference, we want to change plus-size women's idea that they can only wear a bikini that hides their body. We think all women’s bodies are beautiful and want to give curve and plus-size women a new option in swimwear. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Sustainability</strong></p>
<p>We have chosen to minimise our carbon foot print as we know the damage the fashion industry can do to the environment. After successful local pre-production sampling we found we could do all bikini manufacturing and production of tags and labels in the UK. Our performance fabric is currently from Italy but we intend to source from the UK if, and when, this becomes possible. </p>
<p> </p>

<p>We feel what you wear on the beach is an important part of feeling great and that feeling great is one reasons for going on holiday in the first place!</p>

</div></div>","Our Bikini Story
After 10 years of looking for the perfect bikini, I did not find one that flattered or complemented my body. Often the briefs were cut for women who did not have a bigger belly, which meant that it did not cover me well or stay up with movement. It was uncomfortable and often embarrassing to constantly be moving it around. 
Therefore I decided I had to fix this by creating a range of bikinis designed for curve and plus-size women. Girl Got Curves bikinis are designed for women who want innovative sizing with a comfortable fit, that combines the latest quality swimwear fabric to provide lightweight and outstanding support.
 



The Bikinis
The Girl Got Curves bikini brief has been designed to flatter, highlight and enhance your curves. The mid-waist cut and wider waist band makes you feel covered in the right places and stops the need to rearrange the brief. We have carefully placed ruching in the centre to enhance your natural shape. The top of the brief is fashionable and on-trend with a V shape, while the bottom is a Brazilian cut which shows off your curves. 
Our bikini tops have been designed with larger cup sizes in mind to ensure full coverage but keeping a fashionable look. Our tops can be tied in two ways, either traditional halter neck or, for comfortable all day wearing for larger cups, it can be tied in a 'bra' style.
Our bikinis tops come in two styles: 

A Single strap traditional look available in red, black and white 
A Double strap for a more exciting look available in pink and blue

We make one style of brief designed to match and compliment both tops. Briefs are available in all colours so you can mix & match.

 

 
The Sizes
All bikinis items come in UK sizes 14, 16, 18, 20, 22 and 24.


Prices
At launch our prices will be:

Brief - £25
Single and Double strap tops - £30
Bikini Set (mixed or matching colour) and style - £50

If you support us through this campaign today, you will be receiving your items with up to 20% discount and will be one of the first owners of a Girl Got Curves bikini. 


 
Our Mission
Girl Got Curves wants to give women the confidence to wear a bikini, no matter their size or shape. Like us, we want women to love their bodies and feel comfortable showing them off on holiday, knowing that our bikinis are designed around strong women with real bodies. After speaking to over 200 women about their bikini choices, or rather the lack of them, we understood their reality and their need for a well-fitting, fashionable bikini.
Often bikinis made for plus-size women are high-wasted, designed to cover the entire tummy area. Although we understand this is some women's preference, we want to change plus-size women's idea that they can only wear a bikini that hides their body. We think all women’s bodies are beautiful and want to give curve and plus-size women a new option in swimwear. 
 
Sustainability
We have chosen to minimise our carbon foot print as we know the damage the fashion industry can do to the environment. After successful local pre-production sampling we found we could do all bikini manufacturing and production of tags and labels in the UK. Our performance fabric is currently from Italy but we intend to source from the UK if, and when, this becomes possible. 
 
What the money will be used for
After a personal investment of £5,000 it enabled Girl Got Curves to design and create our first bikini prototype, produce a number of samples and establish our website. Now we need your help to create our first batch of bikinis to sell. The majority of the money raised will be used to manufacture in the UK, ready in time for summer.

<p><b>RecycleDot S tabourets</b> are made from the following materials: jute rope, pale

tabouret will be equipped with high-quality <b>portable Bluetooth speakers!</b> <br/></p>

<p>This remarkable tabouret also has a<b>

<p>All these great features can be turned on/off by just pushing a nice blue LED light power button.</p>

When creating these pieces of art, another great and ""<b>green</b>"" aspect of this project can be highly considered. We

"" in "" Baoulé"", a West-African language. It is a line of
feminine lingerie and swimsuit which mixes  the western trends  to colored and original
fabrics and accessorizes of Africa. It was launched  in 2013 by Ms Api. 
Atiklaman
aims to beautify women, make them feel sexy, appealing   and then   promote to a wide public the wealth
of the African fashion through the lingerie and the swimsuit. the era of  fashion only "" made in Europe "" is over, an emerging time is born the art of mixing materials: An alliance  without complex, and advocating the
open-mindedness even for the feminine underwear.        Africa
is represented in prints  and accessorizes
used :   ""WAX"" printed, african traditional designs, African Jewels,
pearls, shells as well as the west with  lace, satin,  microfiber…                                                                   ""YOU ARE A QUEEN""         The slogan of Atiklaman  is:    ""You are a QUEEN"" Because all the women are beautiful and deserve to be highlighted and sublimated.Our principles and values ​​are summarized in 4 points1-All women are beautiful : Atiklaman therefore enhances all the beauties
and works with models without discrimination of race.we also make a point of showcasing the beauty of minorities, those not often seen on advertising posters.
2-Quality : Atiklaman also works with quality materials and provide quality
products to its customers. Materials are tested before being used .3-Project manager :
Accessories and African jewelry used come directly from Africa . We work with
small workshops  for authenticity and as partners to contribute to their
economical growth.
4-Solidarity:  Atiklaman also
wants to contribute to improving quality of life especially in Africa and to
show solidarity. That is why we have decided to support a cause every year
through our ongoing operation:                                                                       ONE
YEAR, ONE CAUSEThis year, our aid will go to CARE ALBINO CHILDREN, a small Ivorian
association wich defends the rights of poor albinos children and helps them by
providing, among other, products and accessories for their skin protection,
school accessories.For every purchase of an outfit ( and also here on Indiegogo),Atiklaman
will make a donation of $ 3  to  CARE ALBINO CHILDREN               Who? The story of AtiklamanI’m

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>It all started when I saw an online discussion involving a few people who wanted to make stickers to replace Fruitvale BART station with ""Oscar Grant"" on BART system maps. I thought to myself, what if we could replace <i>every</i> BART station name with Bay Area icons of social justice? <b>Why shouldn't we live in a world where we can take a ten car train to Angela Davis International Airport, or to Ohlone cities like Huchian or Ramaytush?</b> How would this altered geography change our perception of what is truly important?</p>
<p>The Decolonized Area Rapid Transit (DART) design evolved out a ""crowdsourced"" process where the station names were discussed through Facebook comments. 40-60 people made suggestions for different local social justice heroes, some less known than others, which in itself was an educational process as commenters advocated for different communities.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Whoever owns one of these DART t-shirts will be a proud, walking map of the ""other Bay Area"" – where we don't honor conquistadors, missionaries, big money developers, and colonization. Instead, we honor activists and intellectuals in labor, gay rights, racial justice, civil rights, indigenous self-determination, women's rights, queer rights, disability rights, and more. We also recognize that we live on and benefit from occupied indigenous lands by emphasizing Ohlone names for local places.</p>
<p>The finished DART map is a wonderful educational tool that will have people asking questions and educating themselves about names and causes they may not be familiar with. With so many Bay Area social justice icons and heroes to be proud of, it's the perfect discussion starter and an awesome way to rep your home.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I'm committed to having these tshirts silkscreened by local artists. Why? On-demand printing websites commonly use heat transfer printing, which usually results in lower-quality, blocky prints. By silkscreening, the result is more pleasing to the eye and sense of touch.</p>
<p>On-demand printing also send our money out to a faceless national corporation, whereas silkscreening locally keeps money in the community and supports local artists. It's my way of keeping resources circulating locally.</p>
<p>Silkscreening is a process where each color in the design needs to be separated and printed. The DART design contains six colors - black, red, orange, yellow, green, and blue. The overall cost breaks down like this:</p>
</div><blockquote style=""margin: 0 0 0 40px; padding: 0px;"">
<div><p>Film output: $5 per color x 6 = $30</p></div>
<div><p>Screens: $25 per color x 6 = $150</p></div>
<div>
<p>Pantone color match: $10 per color x 6 = $60</p>
<p>Six color tshirt printing: $2.78 per tshirt x total quantity 72 = $221.76</p>
<p><b>PRINTING TOTAL: $461.76 + 8.75% tax = $502.16</b></p>
</div>
</blockquote><div>
<p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: 800;""><br/></span></p>
<p><b>If we don't reach the entire goal, the money raised will still be used to print tshirts, though it will be an appropriately reduced quantity.</b></p>
<p>When finished, these tshirts will be offered for sale in a select number of locally-owned Bay Area shops. A certain percentage (to be determined) of the income from sales will be donated to local causes.<b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>Remember, if you donate a certain amount of money now towards the printing, you automatically reserve a shirt for yourself!</b><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>You can help by getting the word out on Facebook, Twitter, Google Plus, and anywhere else you can reach friends, comrades, and colleagues who are proud to live in or be from the Bay Area. Any donation helps, no matter how small.</p>

<strong>Les Autres Étoiles</strong><em><strong> • </strong></em><strong>The Other Stars</strong>
</h2>
<p>Hello everyone, I'm Zii (Chun-Zi) - I'm the creator behind the concept for my shoppe, Les Autres Étoiles. This concept has been in the works for a year now and I'm finally ready to get started on making this a huge part of my life. I spend a good portion of every week sewing to my hearts content, but it's always projects for other occassions. I'd now like to move forward with Les Autres Étoiles and present to you my own interpretation of fashion. </p>
<p>I aspire to inspire and to bring my creations to life in the very large (and always growing) fashion industry. To be an entrepreneur is a very difficult lifestyle choice to make. It requires a lot of time, effort, energy and money to get started, and even more of the aforementioned to keep yourself stable once your business takes off. I've never been more sure of a decision in my life. This is who I am, this is how I want to live, this is what I want to do. Through funding my campaign, you're becoming a very huge part of my long sought-after dream and for that I am forever in your debt. </p>
<h3><strong>Concept</strong></h3>
<p>My clothing will reflect a combination of French romance and elegance, with Japanese-inspired playfulness (bright colours, interesting combinations of fabrics not normally used together, etc.) all wrapped into a couture designing style. These designs will be structured yet fluid. They’re designed for the alternative person who can feel appropriate in all occasions both formal and casual without having to adjust their outfit. You will certainly be noticed when you enter a room in this collection as I am combining a lot of very opposite elements to create a perfect harmony in garment design.</p>
<p>Every garment I make will speak for itself. I plan to make a range of garments from skirts and dresses to sweaters, shrugs, boleros and even gloves and wrist warmers! I'd like to bring an entire line to life with my official shop launch.</p>
<h3><strong>Donations</strong></h3>
<p>When you make a donation to this campaign, I'd like you to be fully aware of what you're contributing towards. Not only are you making my dreams a reality, but you're buying the supplies I need to make that happen. The following is a list of items and materials I plan to purchase with this money:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dress Forms - One in each size range, to ensure a perfect fit of all items before they're sent out.</li>
<li>A Cutting/Rotary Mat - For precision cutting that isn't nearly as time consuming as scissors can be!</li>
<li>A Cutting Table - One that can fold away when not in use as my work space is extremely limited, and cutting out patterns on my kitchen floor is not ideal.</li>
<li>Wacom Bamboo Create Tablet - So that I can professionally transfer my designs from paper to my computer, and create CUSTOM fabrics to be used only for Les Autres Étoiles. </li>
<li>Custom Printed Fabrics (which range from $16/m to $38/m)</li>
<li>Custom Sew-In Tags - So that every garment is marked with a logo and a size, plus washing instructions!</li>
<li>Specialty Fabrics from a near-by city (Toronto, Ontario) that has a much larger selection than my current location.</li>
<li>Travel to and from said destination.</li>
<li>Notions &amp; Tidbits - This includes all zippers, thread, buttons, needles, pressing hams, a new iron, trims, yarn, elastic, ribbon, lace, storage containers, et cetera. </li>
</ul><p>Please remember, <em>every donation counts</em>! Small donations can add up quickly and have a huge impact on a fundraising goal. I truly appreciate every cent received, and I will make extremely good use of all of the funds I raise. </p>
<p>If you can't afford to contribute, I do understand. Another way you can help is by sharing my campaign with your friends and promoting my campaign on your own facebook pages.</p>
<h3><strong>Thank You!</strong></h3>
<p>Thank you all so much for taking the time to read about my goal with Les Autres Étoiles and for all of your contributions! To reach this goal will change my entire life and make me feel more complete on the path I'm choosing to go down. </p>
