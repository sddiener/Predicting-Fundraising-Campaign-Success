<li>My name is Jeremy Steding, I'm an independent country and western singer/songwriter. My roots are in Florida, my home is in Texas and my bed is in Nashville. I have a beautiful/talented wife and a glorious, gifted, 2 foot 9 inch, 25 pound wild man of a son, named Jackson Daniel Steding. I work with exceptionally talented, good-natured musicians, and an incredible production team. I am very grateful to be surrounded by amazing people. In addition to maintaining a strong tour schedule, I currently work three side jobs; slinging salmon at Park Cafe, driving Lyft and building websites to keep the dream afloat. I write. I book, I create. I believe. I love my family. I keep busy. </li>

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>My name is Katherine Moller and I am a Celtic fiddler/violinist from Harvey, NB. </p>
</div><div>
<p>I started playing the violin when I was 6 years old, and fell in love immediately!  Over the years I have released 5 solo albums, and one album with my Celtic band, Different Folk. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Album</h3>
<p>Back in 2016 Facebook introduced a live feature where you could perform shows for your fans.  Since then, I have been hosting a weekly show called “Tea &amp; Tunes” with my guitarist Tom Richards.  We have performed a mix of traditional and original music through the years.  After over 150 episodes, we decided to record an album!</p>
<p>Over the past few months we narrowed down the tunes, and then asked you, our fans, to help us chose the pieces that are going to be on the recording.</p>
<p>At this point we have recorded the tracks, and have done a photo shoot for the album. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What is left to do?</h3>
<p>We still need to mix, master, and duplicate the ""Tea &amp; Tunes"" album.</p>
<p>Recording an album, even a relatively inexpensive one takes around $10,000.  We are only asking for help finishing the project as the majority of it has been paid for already at this point.</p>

	Over the past couple of years I have been blessed with inspiration and have had the opportunity to create quite a lot of original music.  This past summer while on personal retreat in the Sacred Valley of Peru, I found an abundance of opportunities to share my music, and was approached almost daily by people asking where they could find recordings of these songs.  After shrugging my shoulders countless times, I began to get a clear message:  once back in the US, recording would need to become a priority. <br/></p><p>About one week after returning to the States, I received a surprising phone call from an old colleague and friend, Bob Novak.  He said to me, ""hey, you want to record?""  I was stunned and thrilled by the question, as it seemed to be the answer to my prayers.  Bob and I had both been students at the Peabody Conservatory in Baltimore, MD in the 1990s, and since graduation, both of us had shifted our careers in new and exciting directions.  I had left my path as a classical flutist to create sacred music, and Bob had begun to invest his time more and more in recording and producing music.  The energy was perfect for us to begin this collaboration, and I was delighted to begin recording within a week of our original conversation.  Only one thing was missing:  as all of this came up unexpectedly, I hadn't exactly been budgeting for making a CD!  <br/></p><p>Musicians showed up, and resources began to show up too.  This entire recording process has been an experience in trust, and in receiving the blessings as they appear.  True to the very spiritual traditions this music comes from, my debut album, <i><b>Songs of Spirit</b>,</i> has indeed been created out of the inspiration, faith, and devotion of all those who have contributed to it.  Bringing together mantras and sacred songs from a variety of spiritual traditions, this music connects deep to the heart, and brings people to experience peace, harmony, joy, and pure love.  At this time, the album is nearly complete, and I am excited to take the next steps toward getting it out into the world.  </p><p><b><br/></b></p><h2><b>Songs of Spirit ~ Music with Heart</b></h2><p>Let's face it, there is a lot of music written and produced every day, there are many inspired and gifted musicians doing their best to get their music out to the world, and most songs are born and quickly forgotten.  What makes <i><b>Songs of Spirit </b></i>special, and why should you contribute to this fundraiser campaign?  Why should the music of Angela Blueskies receive your support?  </p><p>I could tell you more about my background, about my career as a musician, and about what makes me special.  But what I find much more meaningful is the essence of the music I'm sharing with the world.  While all the music on this album is original, I can't claim to be the songwriter for any of it!  When the inspiration comes, the songs are fully formed, and I'm just blessed to be listening in at the moment when Spirit shares them with me, and it is truly an honor to be able to share them with others.  These are songs that carry the essence of Peace, Love, Harmony, and Truth, and in the midst of a world filled with so much suffering and insanity, music that carries a higher vibration is a much needed contribution.  </p><p>These songs are a celebration of living from the heart, and invite the longing we all feel to connect to something greater than the mundane daily existence in this world.  Whether we realize it or not, every one of us feels this longing, and it is through sacred songs such as these that our longing is given expression.  Most of the songs on this album contain Sanskrit mantras ~ prayers from the ancient traditions of India ~ that are meant not only to connect us to the Divine and our true selves, but also to create a more beautiful, harmonious, and joyful world through choosing to remember what matters most.  <br/></p><p><br/></p><h2>Angela's Bio<br/>

</p><p><b><a href=""http://angelablueskies.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Angela Blueskies</a> </b>is
a musician, sound healer, songkeeper, and medicine woman who carries
deep understanding of the healing powers of music and the Earth. A
lifelong musician, she received her training as a classical flutist
at the prestigious <i>Peabody
Institute </i><span>in
Baltimore, MD. In her performing career, she began to long for a
deeper sense of connection and presence with her audiences. It was
while travelling in South America that Angela first encountered
traditions that worked with songs and music for healing and
transformation. Deeply influenced by sacred ceremonies in Peru and
the traditions of bhakti yoga and kirtan, she began to create
original music that was a fusion of these traditions, with an
intention of bringing people into meditation, ecstatic states, and
profound connection with Spirit. S</span>he
has shared her music in concert halls, churches, schools, yoga
studios, temples, in nature, and in sacred ceremony across four
continents. She is an enthusiastic teacher and facilitator, and
enjoys empowering people in connecting with themselves, their gifts,
and their own inner wisdom. Angela currently divides her time between
Washington, DC and Pisac, Peru<b>.</b></p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>

with their true voices through working with mantras, sound

encounters with their own limiting beliefs and stories, and through

<p><b>Original Medicine Song ~ </b>In
some indigenous cultures, there is a tradition of a woman seeking the
song of the soul of her future child, and once it is received from
Spirit, it is sung to the soul of the child until birth, and to the
child throughout his or her lifetime.  This
beautiful tradition has been lost in modern cultures, but it is
Angela's heartfelt desire to bring this tradition slowly back to
life.  In light of this, those contributors that request an original
Medicine Song will receive a personal consultation in order to
determine what is most fitting for the contributor.  Then, Angela
will invite Spirit to send her the best mantra, words, and melody for
the Medicine Song.  Once it is finished, Angela will make a live
recording of the song for the contributor, and it will be sent as an
MP3 file.  In addition, whenever Angela shares the song in the future
at concerts, kirtans, or other events, the song's contributor will be
recognized as the one to whom the song is dedicated.  <b><i>Jai Kali Ma Package</i></b>

<p><b>Kirtan Concert </b>~ Those
who contribute at this level will receive a kirtan concert with
Angela Blueskies dedicated to them in their home community at a venue
of their choosing.  The concert can be hosted in a private home that
meets necessary needs for the concert, or can be at a venue of the

concert are the responsibility of the contributor.  Location for the

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello, my name is Jeffrey Kelly, and I am the founder of Rökkur Production. As a long-time fan of various subgenres of industrial/EBM, gothic, and metal music I have often run into the problem that the bands I want to see rarely come to Seattle, or even the USA oftentimes. I plan to change this. By creating Edge Fest I hope to create a quarterly industrial music festival where all can come together to experience a show unlike any other, and even better, meet the bands in the process! </p>
<p>In addition to being a kick-ass concert, all proceeds from the concert will be donated directly to KNHC, Seattle's own non-profit radio station to keep Seattle's hottest music and late-night industrial host Paul from On The Edge on the air COMMERCIAL FREE!</p>
<p>Edge Fest will take place on Friday, January 31st at Studio Seven in Seattle Washington.</p>

<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Here's the deal--As awesome as shows are, they tend to be expensive to organize. Luckily, most of us can just enjoy the show without needing to worry about the financial aspect. I, however, do not get to enjoy that luxury. As this is the very first Edge Fest night, I need to raise between $750 and $1,000 in order to reach my fundraising goal to put on this show. All money I receive from these donations will go directly towards transportation and lodging for the bands (not all of them can sleep on my couch), promotions, props, and lights. Our headliner for this event is NYC-based HANZEL UND GRETYL. And as excited as I am to have them, I have to face the harsh reality that it will cost about $350 just to fly them into Washington. As you can see, all money donated to this cause will go towards a great benefit, and we would be forever grateful for your generosity. Any money that exceeds our goal will go towards future events for bringing in headliners from outside of the USA!</p>
<p>So, now that the boring aspect of us needing a little financial step-up to get this show started is over, how about the more interesting part--what you get in return for your donations!</p>
<p>There are various donation levels, and for pledging at different levels you can be entitled to win some awesome thank-you gifts ranging from signed posters, VIP tickets, season-passes, instruments and production gear, and even limited-edition and signed merchandise from all sorts of bands in the scene! </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">KNHC, otherwise known as C89.5 has been a long-operating dance radio station in Seattle Washington. They have been on the air for over 40 years 100% commercial free all thanks to listener support and donations. However, the pressure to raise enough money for the annual $800,000 budget can be stressful and chaotic for everyone. In order to help keep this public radio station alive I feel it is my duty to support them, and I need your help.</span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> I volunteered at C89.5 for nearly 3 years as an on-air host and production manager. I know how it feels to be in the hot spot being unsure of whether or not we would make our goal and if we would have to close down the station. I know they fear that every year. But I aim to lessen that fear. I want to support the radio station and all those who donate their time to keep it alive and playing all of Seattle's hottest music commercial free.</span><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Of course not everybody can donate money--I totally understand. Money is tight these days, and people have to be careful with their spending. If it isn't within your financial ability to donate to the cause but would still like to get involved to help get this show on the road, then any form of promotion you could lend to the event would be spectacular. Simply sharing the event or this fundraiser on Facebook or Twitter is enough to show your support for making this event a reality. </p>

<p>I'm Schuyler Neilson. I'm an aspiring musician and that's all I wanna do. I'm almost 18, and I'm finally breaking into the professional music world in a big way. I get to go on tour in Europe from December 4th through January 7th! In addition, most expenses are paid. <i>Most.</i> I still need help getting money for my plane ticket over there, and a portion of the living expenses. I've wanted to get my name to Europe as a musician practically my whole life, and this is my chance! Your help means the world to me.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>We still need $1500 to get me over there. Once there, the people who arrange the tour are putting us up in musician housing which we have to help pay for. And we have prizes! If you donate $2 dollars or more, you'll get recordings that I played on. $5 gets you the same, plus stickers of the band. During the tour we'll be taking a bunch of photos and making a booklet at the end which could be yours for $10, or a poster from the tour for $15. $25 gets you a cd we're putting together of separate projects from all of the different musicians going on the tour. Lastly, if you go huge and donate $100 or more, you get an album of live recordings from the tour!</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>This has been a life long dream of mine, and is a GREAT chance to help me get out there to do what I've always wanted to do for a career… Music! This may also be my only chance (or at least for a long long time) to get across the pond which is a great place to make it as a musician, so this is super important to me.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Of course not everyone can contribute right now, as we are living in rough times. But that doesn't mean you can't help! We also need help spreading word of this fundraiser. Helping send this to your friends so as many people as possible get to see helps immensely!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Well hello out there! I am so happy that you've decided to check out my campaign. <br/>Firstly, my name is Nick Gibbs. I like to think of myself as a musician, but you may think of me as a singer, composer, songwriter, teacher, father, husband, lover of life.<br/>I'm an Australian living in Germany. I've studied the voice....continue to study the voice (and also teach singing) to around 40 wonderful students. <br/>I love writing music that transports you to another place. My place. My Life.<br/><br/>Recently, I released my first EP, ""Comfortable Being"", funded by Monkeymo Records, an independent record company in Munich. </p>
<p>The ""Comfortable Being"" EP has certainly received wonderful support from many people all over this earth, but unfortunately I just don't have the funds to pay for the rest of the album to be  produced and recorded (this is, of course, where you come in!!)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Supporting this project means supporting an exciting, extremely creative artist with all the funds necessary to release my first album and hopefully, with your help. have a shot at the world stage! Or at least take the next HUGE step in my music career.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Quite simply, I need to raise something around the 15 000€ mark. I've made this calculation considering the amount of money the Comfortable Being EP cost, and the scope of the rest of the album (including everything from orchestration to studio time, session musicians to printing costs), this seems like a realistic number.<br/><br/>All of the material is written, and is just sitting there, patiently waiting to be awesomely arranged and produced like the three songs on the Comfortable Being EP were!<br/><br/></p>
<p>Of course I don't expect to get something for nothing, though. Nuh-uh. No way. Check out my perks and you may just want to get involved! </p>
<p>Pledge 30€ and receive a physical copy of the finished CD plus a digital download. and thank you on my website!</p>
<p>Pledge 100€ and receive a signed copy of the finished CD, digital download, Nick Gibbs merchandise and a personal mention in the CD liner notes!</p>
<p>Pledge 1000€ and receive all of the above PLUS either an acoustic concert at your party/event OR a song written personally for YOU by ME! Imagine that!</p>

<p>Even if you can't contribute, it DOESN'T MEAN YOU CAN'T HELP! You can go and download the Comfortable Being EP RIGHT NOW from iTunes, amazon, googleplay or CD Baby...or stream it with Spotify or Simfy. Also, don't forget to share the youtube video or just simply tell all your friends if you think the music is any good!<br/><br/>Thank you all so much!

I'm 25 years old and I have been studying musical theater for the last year at the American Musical and Dramatic Academy College and Conservatory of the Performing Arts (AMDA) in Hollywood. 
For my 3rd semester the school makes it available for students to take a semester in New York City, if they are in good academic standing and maintain a 3.0 GPA. Not every student eligible gets to go, but I have been selected to attend beginning the fall semester 2013. 
I am very excited about this. Unfortunately I don't have all the funds I need to attend... THAT'S WHERE YOU COME IN!

I HAVE A DREAM...
AMDA is very prestigious musical academy in the performing arts world. By your generous donation I will be continuing this amazing education and be that much closer to receiving my bachelor’s degree in musical theater, and one day achieving my ultimate dream of performing on Broadway.  
This is a once in a life time opportunity for me to study under some of the best singing, musical theater, and acting coaches in the business, and also get the chance to be in the city I will eventually live in once I finish my education at AMDA.



What I Need & What You Get
FINANCIAL BREAK DOWN
SO... the amount I am going to raise is $7,500. That
     will cover my tuition & housing payments, my air fare to and from New
     York, books I will need to purchase for my classes, student fees, and
     living expenses.
YOUR PERKS 
Some of the perks you can get if you donate include; a digital copy of the song from this video, a shout out on Facebook and Twitter, 

Enjoy an EVENING FOR TWO at Opening Night of MY First Show on Broadway! 


A personal concert at your house for you and your friends 


Two FREE tickets to any show I'm performing in for 2014


A call on your birthday  


A ""thank you"" video of me singing a song 


An Autographed 8x10 Glossy  


A digital copy of my Christmas CD 


A digital recording of the song from this video

A shout out on Facebook and Twitter 
And the chance to say you knew me when
     (ha-ha, just kidding) :)

Claim Your Perks! 

If you would like to claim your perks, please email me at:
kimberlyannfed@gmail.com 
so i can get them to you asap! thank you 

WHY I AM REACHING OUT 
If I do not raise all the money I
need, unfortunately I will not be able to go to New York. My family does not
have the funds to help me at the moment, which is why I’m reaching out to you. The impact
your donation will have is tremendous




The Impact
It has been my dream for as long as I can remember to
     perform and eventually go to Broadway. I strongly believe that when you find something you are passionate about in life, you go for it! Well it may be a struggle at times, but I'm definitely going for it. 
My family has always supported me in everything I do so it's a bit hard for them to not be able to help out as much as they would like to. They all believe that I have the talent and the drive to really go far and I'd really like to be able to prove them right. 
By you contributing, you are helping me continue my education in the art of musical theater and helping me get my Bachelors of Fine Arts degree, which I will use to teach kids about music and self expression through the arts while pursuing my musical theatre career. 



Other Ways You Can Help


I know times are tough right now and
not everyone can contribute but there are other ways you can help: 
SPREAD THE WORD! I can’t do this solely by my own word
     of mouth; I need the help of everyone to get the word out there. If you
     could please post the link on Facebook or Twitter or any other Social
     Networking site that would be amazing! 
Also tell your friends who may not
     have Social Media who might be interested in donating a dollar or two
     towards someone’s future.

<p class=""p2"">     My good friend Danny and I are both saxophone players from NY and we need YOUR HELP to get our new project under way!  Danny and I have always had a passion for performing with jazz big bands and other large ensembles.  We love writing the music as well as the thrill of playing our music with others.  Along with an incredible roster of fellow musicians and friends, Danny and I think we can contribute to and expand upon the tradition of a beautiful and incredible art form!  </p>
<p class=""p2"">     The #DRMCGRoove is about moving people who enjoy all styles of music, like we do.  Whether it is covering one of the greatest R&amp;B tunes, with our own twist, or expressing our own original compositions, the hope is to always reach out to people and share the wonderful experience of live music!  </p>
<p class=""p2"">     Our large ensemble, a Big Band, will consist of:</p>
<p class=""p2"">5 Saxophones</p>
<p class=""p2"">4 Trumpets</p>
<p class=""p2"">4 Trombones</p>
<p class=""p2"">Piano, Bass, Drums</p>
<p class=""p2"">     This group will be playing mostly originals by Danny and myself; but certainly some of our favorites from this extensive genre, old and new, will make their way into the sets.  With our combined catalogues, Danny and I have already managed to put a book together of over 50 charts!</p>
<p class=""p2"">     The second group we will be recording with will be a smaller (but still large!) ensemble with 8 horns:</p>
<p class=""p2"">4 Saxophones</p>
<p class=""p2"">2 Trumpets</p>
<p class=""p2"">2 Trombones</p>
<p class=""p2"">Piano/Keyboards, Bass, Drums, Guitar, and 2 Vocals</p>
<p class=""p2"">     This group will be playing our versions of some of our favorite covers in the attempt to make anyone and everyone move to the music!  We will be covering everything from 30's swing to R&amp;B and Rhianna!  This band will host swing dances, play dance clubs, and book parties of all kinds, so give us a call!  Our book for this band grows daily as we think of new songs! </p>
<p class=""p2"">     We will also be filming the whole session, so keep reading to the ""Perks"" to find out how to get a behind the scenes look!  </p>
<h2 class=""p1""><strong>                                           The Process</strong></h2>
<p class=""p2"">     Undertaking a project like this is never easy.  The monetary difficulties aside, it is hard simply to find all the right musicians and book a space to rehearse with a band with 13 horns!  But in the attempt to bring everyone into the process, we've broken down our expenses so that everyone knows where their money will be spent!</p>
<p class=""p2"">Recording Studio = $1500.00</p>
<p class=""p2"">Film Equipment = $600.00 </p>
<p class=""p2"">Film Editing = $350</p>
<p class=""p2"">Demo CD Pressed = $1300</p>
<p class=""p2"">DVD = 500</p>
<p class=""p2"">Band Pay = $1000.00 (But all our players are at the top of their fields and deserve</p>
<p class=""p2"">                             more! Many of our musicians believe in our music and for that we</p>
<p class=""p2"">                             thank them, but they have earned every penny we can offer!)</p>
<p class=""p2"">     There's always more expenses with a project such as this, and if we were to go over our goal, money would then be allocated towards a PA System, microphones, stand fronts, band folders, etc!  We have set a goal for this drive that could cover most of our recording expenses, but whether we reach it or not, anything helps!    </p>
<h2 class=""p1""><strong>                                         Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p class=""p2"">     The ultimate goal once we finish recording is to have a great demo CD with accompanying DVD.  Videos will be up our websites etc, but we will have a special copy of the DVD with extra footage of the session for those who contribute generously!  We really can't thank you enough for taking the time to check out our project!  Your help will go not only towards promoting our professional career, but towards spreading the awe-inspiring beauty of large ensemble music!  So again, from the bottom of our hearts, Danny and I want to thank everyone for their contributions!</p>

<h3>Hello,</h3>
<p>My name is Stacy White and I am currently a junior in college enrolled at The Academy of Contemporary Music at The University of Central Oklahoma. About three weeks ago my university finalized a study abroad program with our sister school in Guildford, U.K. The spring of 2014 will be the first semester that this unique opportunity has become available to students. Being that next fall will be my last semester in school before I graduate (a semester earlier than I'm supposed too) I would love to take this chance to study abroad in the spring. This is a unique opportunity being that the university in the U.K. was one of the first music schools to ever become a certified music university offering their students not only an education about the music industry but real life experience in class, internships, and real job opportunities. I am currently receiving financial aid but not nearly enough to cover my school expenses here let alone studying abroad. Although my family and myself are working the best that we can to come up with enough funds to support me in this once in a lifetime opportunity, we severely need the support and help from others to make this dream come true for me.The opportunity would provide me with a whole new level of networking and connections to better my future career and offer possible internships as well as jobs for when I graduate in the fall of 2014. By contributing to my campaign and supporting me you will be helping me experience a truly eye opening experience and an amazing education pertaining to  the music industry.

<br/></span></div>","Hello,
My name is Stacy White and I am currently a junior in college enrolled at The Academy of Contemporary Music at The University of Central Oklahoma. About three weeks ago my university finalized a study abroad program with our sister school in Guildford, U.K. The spring of 2014 will be the first semester that this unique opportunity has become available to students. Being that next fall will be my last semester in school before I graduate (a semester earlier than I'm supposed too) I would love to take this chance to study abroad in the spring. This is a unique opportunity being that the university in the U.K. was one of the first music schools to ever become a certified music university offering their students not only an education about the music industry but real life experience in class, internships, and real job opportunities. I am currently receiving financial aid but not nearly enough to cover my school expenses here let alone studying abroad. Although my family and myself are working the best that we can to come up with enough funds to support me in this once in a lifetime opportunity, we severely need the support and help from others to make this dream come true for me.The opportunity would provide me with a whole new level of networking and connections to better my future career and offer possible internships as well as jobs for when I graduate in the fall of 2014. By contributing to my campaign and supporting me you will be helping me experience a truly eye opening experience and an amazing education pertaining to  the music industry. I have set my funds at a maximum of $8,000 which will be used to cover the cost of my living expenses for three months, my meals, my airfare, my tuition, and my medical insurance. Any contribution will help and I would appreciate it so much as for I am so excited to be able to have a chance to pursue this opportunity and I would love to have everyone's help. If you could please share this with your friends and family to help gain more support for me, I will also be covering the entire trip on my blog on tumblr, if you want to further your support and follow me on this adventure. http://staacywacyy.tumblr.com/",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2><b>Why Podunk?</b></h2>
<p>I have a very strong psychological
connection to my childhood home, both the property I grew up on and the larger
region of the Finger Lakes in central New York. My family’s home was on Podunk
Road and the name of the property became Podunk by association. Over the last
4-5 years (living now in the Northwest) I have written songs that I feel draw
heavily from my life in that region. These story-songs contain subtle humor as well
as darker shades of tragedy and lonesomeness and address the everyday trials,
struggles, and joys of rural living. Having welled up from the depths of
everyday experiences, these songs resonate with commonality and familiarity and
draw the listener in to a contemporary, rural-gothic psychological landscape. </p>
<h2>Who is Daniel Boone’s Fault?</h2>
<p>Take a listen <a href=""https://danielheila.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">on my Bandcamp page.</a> Well, the
short answer is anyone living west of the Cumberland Gap. Daniel Boone opened
up passage to the western territories of the US by exploring and breaking trail
through the Cumberland Gap. I am a Northeasterner living in the Northwest and
by default I am Daniel Boone’s Fault. This is the concept behind and name of
the band I periodically assemble to flesh out my songs.</p>
<p>For this
project Jared Burrows will be producing with Lyle Hopkins, bass, Stefan
Thordarson, violin, Josh Wright, drums and Lawrence Wu, engineer and
videographer (please take a look at their team member profiles). This is truly a
stellar arrangement of talent. I played a gig at Presentation House concert
series in North Vancouver, BC in February with these men and the experience was
fulfilling to say the least.</p>
<h2>Help us bring PODUNK into your life.</h2>

producer and rental space have been covered by previous fundraising. Thank you!

apartment in East Oakland was burglarized and my two cellos were stolen. This
violent act, which was unexpected and without any notice, left me completely
devastated and inconsolable. I am a professional musician, and these cellos
were my livelihood.</p>
<p>It took me several more days
to notice I also lost a bike, and two more weeks to figure out I lost a laptop
and an older cell phone. I couldn’t have cared less if the thieves took my
whole apartment - it was my Signature Cello that I really despaired about.<span><br/></span> </p><p></p><p>I’ve done everything we can think of to find the two cellos, but have had no luck.</p><ul>

Stanislaw Mardula, who is a great Polish violin maker and artist.  He designed
a special, unique, one of a kind model. I loved this instrument: it was easy to

some jazz, and play in non-classical ensembles.<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> <span><br/></span></span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">After moving to the bay area, I enjoyed being versatile and performing different genres.

<br/><p></p></div>","What happened?

A week before Christmas, my
apartment in East Oakland was burglarized and my two cellos were stolen. This
violent act, which was unexpected and without any notice, left me completely
devastated and inconsolable. I am a professional musician, and these cellos
were my livelihood.
It took me several more days
to notice I also lost a bike, and two more weeks to figure out I lost a laptop
and an older cell phone. I couldn’t have cared less if the thieves took my
whole apartment - it was my Signature Cello that I really despaired about. I’ve done everything we can think of to find the two cellos, but have had no luck.
Filed a police report and worked with a police detective specialist in theft crime
Had the story aired on two local nightly news shows: KTVU : http://www.ktvu.com/news/news/crime-law/custom-made-cellos-stolen-oakland-musician/ncSy8/KRON4:  http://news.kron4.com/news/rare-cello-stolen-from-oakland-home/

Searched pawn shops, flea markets
Continuing searches on craigslist and eBay
Hung many ‘Reward’ posters and have chased heartbreaking false leads


Who am I?

My name is Pawel, and I am a
professional musician desperately following my dream, while continuing to try
to make ends meet.
I have been a musician my
entire life and my entire professional career has involved music. Today, I
teach piano and cello to students at the ViBO Music Center in San Bruno, Sleepy Hollow Elementary School in Orinda, and The Saklan School in Moraga.  I also teach many private lessons ranging from children as young as 4, to entire families, to retirees.  I play for three Catholic churches, serving as
a piano accompanist at one, playing cello at the second, and serving as a music director at the third. 

For the past year I mostly
played cello in church, where I embellished the hymns with cello lines. It
touched many people.In addition to playing in churches, I play regularly in my world music ensemble, ViBO Simfani.  ViBO Simfani is a quartet of violin, cello, guitar, and drums.  We play a variety of songs from arrangements of classical to Brazilian choro to Latin jazz to European folk.  We have recorded one cd so far, and are planning to record a second one soon - assuming I can replace my cello.

What I need help with!

Now, as I realize it is
finally time to move on…first, MOVE OUT of a place I feel VERY unsafe living
in, and secondly, getting myself together to figure out what I can do to raise
funds to buy a new cello.
Along with a fine
instrument, I need a good bow, hard case, and insurance.  The costs are staggering. 
New Cello: at least  $15,000Good Bow: $3,000 - 5,000Spare Bow: $1,500Hard case: $1,000----------------------------------------Total Needed: 
at least $20,500
I am hoping to raise at

 next stop: horizonFor those of you who don't know us yet - this is the short story.We have been recording and touring as next stop: horizon since 2009. Mainly in Europe. Always with a rental bus. We have this idea: we want to try and see if we can raise money together with YOU - our friends and our fans - to get a bus of our own. That would be so much better in the long run.With a bus of our own we would be much more free to go on tour more often and, when we feel the timing is right. We wouldn't necessary have to wait for promotors to be able pay expensive travel costs (BUS RENTAL!!!).We also have this dream about starting a tour that more or less keeps going nonstop and never has to end. It's something we have been talking about for a long long time now. Therefor it would be absolutely fantastic to have a bus where we also could sleep. Like actually living on the road in periods.We ask different musicians to join us for different tours and projects, and that's the way we want to work. It's a flexible way, and it makes a lot of fun to try out many different ways of arranging and performing our music live. We love to travel and we love to meet new people. We actually believe that travelling and playing our music is somewhat the purpose of our life. Now we'd like to really try to do that without compromising. ...now that you know a little bit more about us, we'd like to ask if you want to take part in this project?!

Our Story#iGIVEafunk is Creative Arts movement led by Bootsy Collins, meant to inspire everyone to STOP, LISTEN, AND STAND UP for each other. It will launch as part of a World Tour and spur a brand new Bootsy Collins Album and Documentary/Live DVD all inspired by the journey. 
In case you're unfamiliar with Bootsy, he has been inducted in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Won Grammies, awarded multiple Gold and Platinum records...but most importantly, we have spent the years working on two initiatives: 

The Bootsy Collins Foundation - ""Say it Loud, a Music Instrument for Every Child""  
The Bootsy Girls - ""To lift the self esteem of young girls & women around the world through music & the arts."". 
Both initiatives have helped us change the lives of thousands of people around the globe, and now we would like to take our outreach to a grander scale. We are passionate about the arts, it is our belief that if we encourage creative activities in young people, they will bloom into much better adults.  
With the help of a few partners we were able to make a small impact on these lives, but we know that by reaching out and connecting to each of you, we have a chance of touching and reaching places that we couldn't using the traditional methods.
We are welcoming you aboard The Funk-Ship, no middlemen saying we can't get down and Funk in your town, no labels telling us how you want your funk..no nothing but you and us, working together to make a difference one person at a time.

Well, ALIAS doesn't like to brag, but our first CD, <i>Hilos,</i> was nominated for a Grammy. But our mission goes beyond
winning awards. ALIAS is dedicated to innovative repertoire, artistic excellence,

three nonprofit partners each season, and we share the spotlight with one

EXPERT COACHING

Each section of the orchestra spends time away from full rehearsals (tutti rehearsals), being guided by expert coaches from some of the world’s best international symphony orchestras and conservatoires. Coaches from the last season included musicians who play regularly with the  Symphony Orchestra, English National Opera, the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, Gothenberg Symphony Orchestra and Amman Symphony Orchestra and professors from the Paris Conservatoire and ESNCM. The PYO musicians and the team of experts, were directed in the past two seasons by the well known English conductor Sian Edwards, a former music director of English National Opera, who regularly conducts at many of ’s leading orchestras and opera houses.

<h3>About Blasphemour Records</h3>
<p>Blasphemour Records was formed in Connecticut in 1999.  We quickly released 2 great CDs, but due to issues beyond our control we needed to close up and relocate to North Carolina.  We decided to put the label on hold and one day lead to 13 years.</p>
<p>Now in 2012 we are back and releasing music again.  Our first release is from PA's Frost Giant, and we couldn't be any more excited to be working with them.</p>

<p>If you do not see something you want, you are welcome to contact us and tell us about what you would like to see as a perk, and we will try and accomodate.</p>
<p>If you are just a giving person and want to help us get off the ground.  We wouldn't say no to your donation.</p>
With the money we earn from this, we will be putting it all back into the label.  All money will go towards future releases, tshirts, stickets, web design, etc.</div>

<p>I am a classically trained pianist. I spent 3 years learning from one of South America's finest pianists Marco Alcantara, and another 4 years under the tutorage of David Marcum, one of the Valley's leading names in piano studies and arrangements.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
Precise Science was conceived originally as a duo Ruffmic &amp; Freedomwriter- emceeing, spoken word, old school/new school simultaneously. As we began on this journey that we were called to take, we didn't know what was ahead. We noticed the boost of self-steem in the youth as we performed around the country. We knew we had the sound to counter-balance out that negative ""slop hop"" being given to children. We have performed at Elementary schools on up to college campuses and your donation helps sustain and advance these efforts globally.</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
All funds from the fundraiser will goto the infastructure of what we do. We want to be as self-sufficient as possible so that we can eliminate third party over-head. We will purchase equipment and supplies that renders us full control of manufactering and distribution of our product. We will have a web-site and initiate youth workshops worlwide. $5000 is the amount needed to move forward. We have recently developed our own studio so now that is a cost that is eliminated. For your generous donation we have a variety of perks from public thank yous to personalized video performances on dvd.</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
We have gathered a cadre of supporters and collaborators that have grown the brand that is Precise Science. We thank the almighty and the ancestors for this opportunity and overstand the duty attached. Ultimately the goal is the liberation of the minds and bodies of a conscious critical mass, so we can reclaim our rightful place in this spiriual existance of human form collectively. Music is the key.</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
Money isn't the only way you can donate. If you could book us for an event in your town or maybe you own a business or have a skill that will further the development and growth of our cause. It would be extremely appreciated as well. Also if you wish to donate audio/computer equipment or supplies that will be appreciated.

<h2>Who Am I?</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>My name is Josh James. I am 25 years old. I am a singer/songwriter originally from Minnesota. I now reside in TN with my beautiful wife and two dogs. I have written songs since the age of 13.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Making music has been my passion ever since I started doing it. I believe it is what I was born to do. It has taken a while to get this album done. All mushy stuff aside, I need help! With your financial support, these 9 songs I have recorded can be released in a truly effective way. Instead of passing my album to family and friends over the internet or peddling a few burned CDs at small gigs, I am aiming high. I want to press 1,000 professionally replicated and packaged CDs, make T-Shirts, help pay for some studio costs, and most importantly, hire a PR firm to help me release and promote a single. I also want to offer YOU some very cool incentives for aiding me along the way.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The album I have made is probably the coolest thing I have ever done in my life. It has been a great experience. If I don't ever get anyone to listen to it, I am not doing my job. In fact, it will be nearly pointless. I can't justify the time and money spent on this album if it is just satisfying a personal dream of mine. My wife, family, and friends have made too many sacrifices for that. That's what you are doing when you contribute to this campaign. PR is going to be the engine in this musical car. I am anticipating shows, press releases, and a bigger social media and internet presence.</p>

<li>$1,000 will go to making CDs packaged and ready to sell</li>
<li>Depending on what route I pursue (single/radio release or publishing deals), PR cost could vary, but it won't be cheap! (I would anticipate $4,000 or more).</li>
<li>If the goal is not reached, the making of CDs takes priority.</li>
<li>If the goal is exceeded, it will assist with studio costs.</li>

<p>With the making of merchandise, I am allowing at least 4 weeks to receive the funds and process my orders. With songwriting and house shows, depending on scheduling, I hope to get them done within six months.</p>

<h3>We are The Dirty Gems and we are so happy you stopped by!</h3>
<p>We began as five Hofstra University alumni (Raycee, Cam, Ulises, Jack and Mills) and were joined in 2011 by our roaming guitar wizard, Gary. It's been an amazing two years. Since the release of our self-titled debut EP, we've played festivals, variety shows, interactive theater experiences, and venues all around NYC including Highline Ballroom, The Bitter End, Sullivan Hall, and many, many more.</p>
<h3>We are now in the beginning stages of recording our second EP, <strong>Vujà Dé</strong>. This second release means a lot to us because it represents our growth as a band. The groove is in place and the audience is dancing, singing, crying and screaming! We want to capture that in an album.</h3>
<p>By contributing to this project, you will be helping us continue to move in a direction that we have been walking together. With the funds, we will be able to go from just having an EP to (hopefully) reaching new fans far and wide, taking our music somewhere we can only imagine! We want the far coasts to be moving and we want you to be there every step of the way! We need that extra push to get to the next level and we want you to be as excited as we are about the future! With your help, we can do anything.</p>

<p>We have always made our music to connect to you, our fans. There is nothing more rewarding than seeing a person in the audience finally let loose and let the music move them! We are eager to take that emotion to bigger stages and states!</p>
<p>Where will your money go IF we don't completely fund this project? Not to worry! The money you do contribute will still be put toward us reaching our goal &amp; the EP will still bring the funk.</p>

<p>We are attempting to take a year and a half’s worth of failures, success, writing, learning, and pouring every spare minute of our creative ability into this full-length album. We want to give a piece of ourselves to you, the listener. We want to take our concepts and dreams and tangibly sculpt them into an experience for the people we love. After cutting our teeth on our first EP, which you funded and made possible, we discovered a vision for our sound and ideas that has culminated into this full-length project. But again, as with our EP, we need your help. We are putting in a lot of our own funds, and skipping a few meals, to afford this gift to you. Even so, we would be hard pressed to manage the funds necessary to see this album come to fruition. We humbly ask for your backing and support to help make our longstanding vision come to life. We cherish any donation, big or small, and Jason can’t wait to make you breakfast.</p>
<p><strong>Our Position and the Risks</strong></p>
<p>We have the help of a great friend, Paul Kimsal, who has agreed to record this album for us. The exciting part of where we are in life is that we have access to gear we wouldn't normally have access too in order to make a great recording. We are in a prime position to explore the avenues of sound we'd like to explore. <strong>Our bigges</strong>t and only real <strong>issue</strong> with this project <strong>is</strong> overcoming the shear mountain of <strong>money</strong> it takes to see our vision all the way through. What we're asking for on Indiegogo is only a portion of what we project it costing us in the long run. With all that said I think our only real risk is not raising what we need.</p>
<p><strong>How You Can Help</strong></p>
<p><strong><br/></strong>On the right side of the screen we have listed various perks for you, should you choose to back us with a bit of money. Anything from a $1 to $1,000 helps. But lets be honest we understand not all of us have extra money to give, and trust we understand that. If you'd still like to help us out please help us post this page and tell as many people as we can. Any bit of you, the reader, passing on our project to others helps. And we appreciate any help we can get.</p></div>","What We Are Hoping to Do

restart</b></p><p><b>Listen to a track: <a href=""http://www.elizalynn.com/new_cd_listen/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.elizalynn.com/new_cd_listen/</a></b></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>How do I begin again?</b> 
Next year will be the 10<sup>th </sup>anniversary of my first album, <i>Frisky
or Fair</i>.  It is humbling to remember all the remarkable gifts that
have come into my life from my community’s response to my first request for CD
pre-orders.  Hearing my songs recorded, fleshed out – rhythms and solos –
I can’t describe the literal ecstasy that I felt experiencing a vision come
into being.  I made a band and learned to book gigs and play different
kinds of venues and be on radio and TV and live at Abbey Road Studios (for
goodness sake).  I got some pretty incredible feedback from lay folk and
industry folk alike and had landmark gifts in the Putumayo album and performing
in Scotland.</p>
<p>But three original albums in four years brought me to a state of
near collapse.  Gone was the initial energy, the willingness to put up
with the constant rejection required to be heard through the cacophony of a
flooded market.  I’d moved to Nashville where I effectively became a hermit,
paying down musical debt and just so grateful that my relationship to the
medicine of music did not leave.  When my friends and fans pre-ordered the
community produced album, I was given another gift in my exhausted state. 
The songs that were chosen were a balm to my psyche, both to record and to
hear. </p>
<p>Little by little, things were changing in my relationship with
the music business and my songs.  Singing one song in response to a sermon
in a tiny Sunday evening service became so deeply fulfilling.  And then,
in 2012, while playing music at a prayer retreat, I heard the words, “Divinity
school is now.”  I followed those words and have just completed my first
year of graduate theological education and it has been a tremendously healing
experience.  I’m writing a thesis on American Blues as Contemporary
Lamentations and amidst all my studies, it seems time to begin again with the
business side of music.</p>
<p>And what better way to do that
than to releasing my fourth album of original music?  It’s called <i>Goodbye
Nashville </i>and it was recorded
on the Isle of Mull one year ago with musicians from the <a href=""http://www.perthshireamber.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Perthshire Amber festival</a>: Gordon MacLean, Sorren MacLean, Hannah Fisher and Danny Grant who are simply stellar musicians and wonderful human beings.  They gave wings to these songs I have spent years crafting.  Three of these songs are co-written, an adventure I attempted while
living in Nashville.  This album has been my companion through this year
of rebuilding something that was broken through the grief of many losses. 
A few days ago, the final mix was completed.  After months of back and
forth with co-producer Gordon MacLean, this album is ready to leave the nest.</p>
<p>I’ve been invited to return to
Scotland to perform this fall at Perthshire Amber Festival and can’t think of a
better place to release this album that has so much of Scotland within
it!  I need to raise $3,000 to have the album in hand.  If I’m able
to raise $5,000, I can hire a publicist for a targeted campaign to radio and
publications.</p>
<p>I don’t know exactly what my
music business will look like this time around, but I know that this is one of
the things I am called to do with my life. </p>
<p>My gratitude for my community’s
companionship with me through these years is enormous – literally the air and
water for my seeds of artistry. Thank you so much for considering to join
with me on this journey to restart my musical career.  Thank you is too
small, but thank you so very much!</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>What I Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p><b>BREAKDOWN OF COSTS</b> to release Goodbye Nashville:</p>
<p>· Mastering the album: $600</p>
<p>· Design of the album: $400</p>
<p>· Pressing 1,000 albums: $1,950
(includes shipping, etc)</p>
<p>· Hiring publicist for a limited
radio and publication release: $1,600</p>
<p>· Fee for using Indiegogo: $200 (if goal is reached); $450 (if goal not reached)</p>
<p>If my goal is not quite
reached, what we do raise will help me release the album on a smaller
scale.  If we exceed the goal, there are many extras (videos, larger
release, additional products, etc) that will become possible.</p>
<p><b>DISCOUNTED ALBUM</b> for Previous Pre-orders:</p>
<p>For those of you who have pre-ordered my previous albums, you
should have received a letter (similar to the one above, with an order form for
albums at the reduced price of $15, shipping included).  If you didn’t
receive a letter, it just means I don’t have a good current address for
you.  Please send me an email (<a href=""mailto:eliza@elizalynn.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">eliza@elizalynn.com</a>) with your address and
I’ll get one out to you.  I’m so grateful for everyone who continues to
enjoy my music and order my albums.  It means more to me than you can
know!</p>
<p><b>PERKS:</b></p>
<p>So I have some incentives if you’re able to give a little more
than the cost of the album.  I am a quilter, so I’d like to offer this joy
of mine to you.  <b>For pictures of these items, please go to <a href=""http://www.elizalynn.com/pre_order_2014"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.elizalynn.com/pre_order_2014</a> </b></p>
<p>· For $55, you’ll receive a
signed album and a handmade, quilted potholder</p>
<p>· For $145, you’ll receive a
signed album and a tea cozy</p>
<p>· For $500, I’ll put on a live
concert at your home (or office, or backyard, etc) plus you’ll receive 5 signed
albums.</p>
<p>· Now we get into some wild
territory:</p>
<p>· For $1,000, I’ll make you a lap
quilt (you can choose the colors and the quilt will be made within the year),
plus you’ll receive 5 signed albums.</p>
<p>· For $2,000, I’ll make you queen
or king size quilt (you can choose the colors and the quilt will be made within

restartListen to a track: http://www.elizalynn.com/new_cd_listen/

How do I begin again? 
Next year will be the 10th anniversary of my first album, Frisky
or Fair.  It is humbling to remember all the remarkable gifts that
have come into my life from my community’s response to my first request for CD
pre-orders.  Hearing my songs recorded, fleshed out – rhythms and solos –
I can’t describe the literal ecstasy that I felt experiencing a vision come
into being.  I made a band and learned to book gigs and play different
kinds of venues and be on radio and TV and live at Abbey Road Studios (for
goodness sake).  I got some pretty incredible feedback from lay folk and
industry folk alike and had landmark gifts in the Putumayo album and performing
in Scotland.
But three original albums in four years brought me to a state of
near collapse.  Gone was the initial energy, the willingness to put up
with the constant rejection required to be heard through the cacophony of a
flooded market.  I’d moved to Nashville where I effectively became a hermit,
paying down musical debt and just so grateful that my relationship to the
medicine of music did not leave.  When my friends and fans pre-ordered the
community produced album, I was given another gift in my exhausted state. 
The songs that were chosen were a balm to my psyche, both to record and to
hear. 
Little by little, things were changing in my relationship with
the music business and my songs.  Singing one song in response to a sermon
in a tiny Sunday evening service became so deeply fulfilling.  And then,
in 2012, while playing music at a prayer retreat, I heard the words, “Divinity
school is now.”  I followed those words and have just completed my first
year of graduate theological education and it has been a tremendously healing
experience.  I’m writing a thesis on American Blues as Contemporary
Lamentations and amidst all my studies, it seems time to begin again with the
business side of music.
And what better way to do that
than to releasing my fourth album of original music?  It’s called Goodbye
Nashville and it was recorded
on the Isle of Mull one year ago with musicians from the Perthshire Amber festival: Gordon MacLean, Sorren MacLean, Hannah Fisher and Danny Grant who are simply stellar musicians and wonderful human beings.  They gave wings to these songs I have spent years crafting.  Three of these songs are co-written, an adventure I attempted while
living in Nashville.  This album has been my companion through this year
of rebuilding something that was broken through the grief of many losses. 
A few days ago, the final mix was completed.  After months of back and
forth with co-producer Gordon MacLean, this album is ready to leave the nest.
I’ve been invited to return to
Scotland to perform this fall at Perthshire Amber Festival and can’t think of a
better place to release this album that has so much of Scotland within
it!  I need to raise $3,000 to have the album in hand.  If I’m able
to raise $5,000, I can hire a publicist for a targeted campaign to radio and
publications.
I don’t know exactly what my
music business will look like this time around, but I know that this is one of
the things I am called to do with my life. 
My gratitude for my community’s
companionship with me through these years is enormous – literally the air and
water for my seeds of artistry. Thank you so much for considering to join
with me on this journey to restart my musical career.  Thank you is too
small, but thank you so very much!

What I Need & What You Get
BREAKDOWN OF COSTS to release Goodbye Nashville:
· Mastering the album: $600
· Design of the album: $400
· Pressing 1,000 albums: $1,950
(includes shipping, etc)
· Hiring publicist for a limited
radio and publication release: $1,600
· Fee for using Indiegogo: $200 (if goal is reached); $450 (if goal not reached)
If my goal is not quite
reached, what we do raise will help me release the album on a smaller
scale.  If we exceed the goal, there are many extras (videos, larger
release, additional products, etc) that will become possible.
DISCOUNTED ALBUM for Previous Pre-orders:
For those of you who have pre-ordered my previous albums, you
should have received a letter (similar to the one above, with an order form for
albums at the reduced price of $15, shipping included).  If you didn’t
receive a letter, it just means I don’t have a good current address for
you.  Please send me an email (eliza@elizalynn.com) with your address and
I’ll get one out to you.  I’m so grateful for everyone who continues to
enjoy my music and order my albums.  It means more to me than you can
know!
PERKS:
So I have some incentives if you’re able to give a little more
than the cost of the album.  I am a quilter, so I’d like to offer this joy
of mine to you.  For pictures of these items, please go to http://www.elizalynn.com/pre_order_2014 
· For $55, you’ll receive a
signed album and a handmade, quilted potholder
· For $145, you’ll receive a
signed album and a tea cozy
· For $500, I’ll put on a live
concert at your home (or office, or backyard, etc) plus you’ll receive 5 signed
albums.
· Now we get into some wild
territory:
· For $1,000, I’ll make you a lap
quilt (you can choose the colors and the quilt will be made within the year),
plus you’ll receive 5 signed albums.
· For $2,000, I’ll make you queen
or king size quilt (you can choose the colors and the quilt will be made within
the year), plus you’ll receive 5 signed albums.
Every purchase also comes with
my heart’s extreme gratitude and my exceeding anticipation for you to hear (and
sing and dance along to) this album!

<p><span>Hello !</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for stopping by!</span></p>
<p>We'd like to invite you on an amazing journey of adventure. Take a seat, relax and take a moment to imagine the following:</p>
<p>Take the epic mysterious and dramatic tones of John Barry’s legendary James Bond
tracks and combine it with a hint of jazz. Then add a swingy rhythm, and a
large soulful voice of a modern diva. 
Stir this well with a retro vibe that takes you way back to the sound of
the freedom of the 1960s, and even further back to the foggy obscure back
streets of the 1920s’ London. Season with a twist of sensual Frenchness and a
glimpse of winter's frosty Scandinavian woods, and you get the sound of Grace
Moon &amp; The Jaguar - Epic, dramatic, deliciously crisp and classy and ready
to eat.<br/></p>
<p>Grace
Moon &amp; The Jaguar consists of London based, Danish singer-songwriter and
pianist Grace Moon and French artist and producer JB Pilon. Together they have more than 35 years of experience in writing and performing music. </p>

Since beeing based in London she has worked with various musicians and producers, and performed her own music  in various legendary London Venues such as The Troubadour, The Forge and The Natural History Museum.

The highest donor will receive a signed manuscript from composer Eric Whitacre!!
    The Impact The students at CU Boulder, UNT, and BYU Hawaii have been deeply inspired by Liz Shropshire and the Shropshire Music Foundation. The student clubs work to provide music service in their communities and host guest speakers who use music for unusual purposes, like SMF. SMF has been working in refugee camps and other areas for 15 years, and the current conflict in and around Syria (see links below) deserves a response that provides music education and a peaceful alternative to children and youth who are living in war-devastated areas. SMF's programs in Kosovo, Uganda, and Northern Ireland have benefitted thousands of children, and we are grateful for your help in continuing those programs as well.

<p><b>Plan of Attack </b></p>
<p>Over the past 2 months we have been working on some new material that we are very proud of. As we continue to hone our songwriting skills we feel our songs are always improving. </p>
<p>We have had several meetings and begun the early stages of pre-production (writing songs, improving those songs, discussing tracklisting, structuring songs etc...) with a producer based in <b>P.E.I</b> named <b>Paul Milner</b>. Paul has over 30 years of experience in the music industry and has worked with some of he best talent in the world...too many to list.</p>
<p>We are going to be heading to his studio in P.E.I and staying there while we track the new EP. We will be there for at least a week while we try to create something you and Amberwood will love. We also plan on touring in the east coast area just prior to recording.</p>
<p>It was important for us to have plenty of time in the studio as well as completely immerse ourselves in the process. Being out in P.E.I by the water seemed like a perfect fit for us.</p>

<p>Paul does a lot...he provides us a studio, helps create the best songs possible, mixes the recordings, masters the recordings etc etc. The price varies quite a bit based on several factors like bringing in guest instrumentalists for strings or horns, time spent in the studio and number of songs recorded (between 5-7 based on which songs work together and in what order) etc</p>

</h3><p>Hello everybody,</p>
<p>For those of you who don’t know me, my name is
Conor Standish, I’m a singer songwriter here in Cleveland, Ohio and I’m the
lead singer and rhythm guitar player in a band called the Burning River
Ramblers. </p>
<p>Ever since I began writing songs in 8th grade,
nothing has made me happier than sharing my music with other people and
affecting them in a positive way. It’s a huge passion of mine and there is nothing
I would rather do for as long as I possibly can.</p>
<p>Although I absolutely love collaborating with
some amazing musicians and friends in the Burning River Ramblers, there are
still a lot of songs that don’t fit our style that I would love to share with
all of you and that I think you’ll love!</p>
<p>And that’s where I need your help! I want to do
this right and I won’t be able to do it without all of you.</p>
<p>In April I’ll be taking a road trip with a few
friends to record an EP in San Francisco at a place called Tiny Telephone. My
good good friend Dave Young who played keys and co-produced BRR’s last album
will be producing this EP and it will consist of around 4-6 songs. The money
given will be used for studio time, hired musicians, mastering, CD production,
and merchandising. The more money we raise, the better this project will be!
The sky is the limit.</p>
<p>So here’s how you can help:</p>
<p>As you’ll see on this project’s IndieGoGo home
page, there are certain gifts I have ready for you if you donate certain
amounts of money. Some of the gifts I have for you are the actual EP,
merchandise, personalized doodles, or you can even sing back up vocals on one
of the songs!</p>
<p>Finally, for every $2,000 we raise, I’ll do
something ridiculous. Here we go!!</p>

<p>There is never a proper way to start these. There is never a proper way to get over your own ego to ask for a little help in exchange for heart and soul I suppose. We've been at this a long time. A very long time. Max and I first started collaborating in some very poorly mismanaged projects in 2006/07ish, can't really be sure on which year but it was around then. It could've started 2 years earlier then that, the details are hazy. Anyway, we moved to portland and radically changed our perception about how we write and perform music. It was a mix of a lot of different experiences that cultivated us to step far outside our boundaries. Now we have made something very real out of it, and we are really excited to be doing it with some amazing people, and some other amazing opportunities. The reality is, so much of this stuff costs money that we would be silly to think we could do ALL of it on our own, or someone will cut us a break in a lump sum. We've been given access to enough resources that we can make this work, and give you guys some really cool stuff of ours in the process. So after finishing a record, and while waiting for it to finish with finalizing the masters and figuring out some last minute details with our upcoming LP we have started to plan a tour, and we need a little cash for it. IT would be so important to us if YOU, any of you, friend, family, or patron could be apart of this. We have been having an insane amount of fun and we would like to bring that to other people nationally, on our own terms and to the people that really want to hear it. We have some amazing merch to give you as a token of gratitude for your help. We are Hexes, we are an electronic music collective from portland, OR that has now been living on the road for a few weeks. Recording and playing on the west coast mostly and now we'd like to take it out even farther. The important part of this, is that we have a good majority of things covered, we just need to cover gas and help with pressing the 7"" essentially. This is our first tour, there are so many things I could go into detail about what this trip means to us, and what we are doing, but it wouldn't be done justice in an internet blurb.</p>

</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>Helping us with this, will immensely make an impact on the support of local music. It's rare for a band of our caliber to take to the states completely on our own, with no help from promoters, labels or anything in between. We are asking for support from the people that have been following us since our early incarnations, and hope to share our music with others along the way with this tour. Just trying to get it out there, ya know?</div>

<p>The challenges we face right now, is proper promotion. We have a ton of friends that see this stuff and are probably fully supportive of what we're doing, however we're all friends here. We see everything in our feeds, half the time I find myself assuming people have seen stuff that I posted a week ago. Social media is growing so fast and works pretty effectively if things are given the proper press. We know you don't want to see someone asking you to give them a buck everyday on your Facebook, and thats totally cool. We're going to however promote as much as we need to to fulfill our goal. </p>

We released HRZN EP, an album we wrote and recorded completely on our own, at the beginning of the year and kicked it off with an incredible release party full of music, great beer, and Star Wars.<br/><br/>We played tons of shows throughout the year and met amazing people. Now, we caught the writing bug and want to create something better than ever to share with you.</p>
<p>We put together all the funds Amoret had on flights to get there and back again (hehe). We figured we had saved some personal funds and could make it happen, and then something exciting happened...<br/><br/>Guitarist CJ Ramsey and singer Christine Graham got engaged! (cue this song from Aladdin <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuZ2EwbxCZc"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuZ2EwbxCZc</a>)<br/><br/>And with all the fun and excitement of wedding planning, also comes the dispersement of personal funds. <br/><br/>So, that's where you guys come in!<br/><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Who is Amoret?</h3>We are Amoret and we reign from the center of the Golden State. We are a pop-infused synth rock quartet, blending our upbeat, synth-driven persona with rock and roll. <br/><br/>Together for four years, we have developed from our singer's solo-project into a band likened to Canadian act Metric with a presence that both captivates audiences and makes them want to dance. <br/><p>Amoret is:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Christine Graham: Vocals and keyboard</li>
<li>CJ Ramsey: Guitar</li>
<li>Jared Johns: Bass</li>
<li>Joshua Ramsey: Drums</li>
</ul> </div> <div> <h3>Here are the deets:</h3> <p>We are recording at the Tiny Tape Room in Nashville, Tennessee with our friend, and the incredibly talented, Kyle Monroe. (<a href=""http://www.tinytaperoom.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.tinytaperoom.com</a>) We're recording October 10-17. </p> <ul> <li>Writing and recording our first full-band EP was an incredible learning experience, and now we would love to create a quality product with an incredible engineer.</li>
<li>We will be recording four songs. Recording, mixing, and mastering will come out to approximately $2,200. </li>
<li>Pressing the album, posters, and other merchandise for the album will cost about $800.</li> <li>Your contributions will be worth your while! Anything from the CD itself, to signed t-shirts, to even a pizza party with the band! We want to let you know that we appreciate each and every donation.</li> <li>If we do not reach our funding goal, it could lead to us recording fewer songs, producing less merchandise, and could delay the production of the album altogether.</li>

Amoret is recording their third EP in Nashville and needs YOUR help!2015 was a great year for us. We released HRZN EP, an album we wrote and recorded completely on our own, at the beginning of the year and kicked it off with an incredible release party full of music, great beer, and Star Wars.We played tons of shows throughout the year and met amazing people. Now, we caught the writing bug and want to create something better than ever to share with you.
We put together all the funds Amoret had on flights to get there and back again (hehe). We figured we had saved some personal funds and could make it happen, and then something exciting happened...Guitarist CJ Ramsey and singer Christine Graham got engaged! (cue this song from Aladdin https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuZ2EwbxCZc)And with all the fun and excitement of wedding planning, also comes the dispersement of personal funds. So, that's where you guys come in!

Who is Amoret?We are Amoret and we reign from the center of the Golden State. We are a pop-infused synth rock quartet, blending our upbeat, synth-driven persona with rock and roll. Together for four years, we have developed from our singer's solo-project into a band likened to Canadian act Metric with a presence that both captivates audiences and makes them want to dance. Amoret is:


Christine Graham: Vocals and keyboard
CJ Ramsey: Guitar
Jared Johns: Bass
Joshua Ramsey: Drums
   Here are the deets: We are recording at the Tiny Tape Room in Nashville, Tennessee with our friend, and the incredibly talented, Kyle Monroe. (http://www.tinytaperoom.com) We're recording October 10-17.   Writing and recording our first full-band EP was an incredible learning experience, and now we would love to create a quality product with an incredible engineer.
We will be recording four songs. Recording, mixing, and mastering will come out to approximately $2,200. 
Pressing the album, posters, and other merchandise for the album will cost about $800. Your contributions will be worth your while! Anything from the CD itself, to signed t-shirts, to even a pizza party with the band! We want to let you know that we appreciate each and every donation. If we do not reach our funding goal, it could lead to us recording fewer songs, producing less merchandise, and could delay the production of the album altogether.

I've just recently recorded a song called ""I Always Knew"" that I feel will be of much value in the world we live in. This is an uplifiting, positive song about communion, love, and compassion -- about seeing our fellow man as an extension of ourselves. It is melodic, sweet, and sincere, and I think a wide demographic of people will connect with it.</p>
<p>What I'm aiming for now is a completely professional music video to help launch ""I Always Knew"" as Substance's debut single. In today's music industry, the visual component that goes along with radio singles is nearly as important as the actual audio recording itself. I believe that in releasing a great-looking video, I will enable this song to reach far more people. It is my dream to inspire and move people with the power of music, and I know that, with YOUR help, this video will be among my most valuable tools in seeing that dream through!<br/><br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In order to make this music video the success I know it can be, the project will need funding -- specifically $5,000. Generally speaking, this is a rather small budget for a music video, though thankfully, I have an experienced director on board, Reed Daigle, who will use his resources and networking to achieve the highest quality product possible. Your monetary contributions will go into everything from lighting to cinematography to establishing locations for shooting and editing/post-production. Every little bit helps and is greatly appreciated!</p>
<p>*Those who contribute $10 or more will receive name recognition and special thanks when the video is finally posted online!</p>
<p>*Those who contribute $100 or more will be welcome to participate IN THE VIDEO as an extra! Won't it be fun to tell all your friends and family that you're famous now?  ;-)</p>
<p>*Those who are extra generous, contributing $1,000 or more, will be on Substance's guest list at EVERY live show in the future -- that means FREE admission for life! That's right: you'll be a part of the Substance family.<br/><br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>In addition to furthering my craft, this music video will in fact give my South Louisiana community some well-deserved attention. There's actually a tremendous amount of musical and artistic talent in my hometown of Houma (and its surrounding areas) -- some of these individuals may even appear in the video. I would love for a spotlight to finally be shined here, and I know the community would be incredibly excited about that as well! Together, we can put Houma on the map!<br/><br/></p>
</div><div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>Even if you don't have the means to contribute monetarily, you can still be a HUGE help to this campaign:</p>
<p>MAKE SOME NOISE! Share this campaign wherever you can! Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, anywhere... Get the word out that an awesome music video is being made that will not only contribute to the success of up-and-coming musicians, but will promote a message of love and peace throughout the world. It's going to be an absolutely rewarding and fun experience!</p>

<p>
</p><p>Hallo, mein Name ist Katharina Maschmeyer, ich bin professionelle Saxophonistin und Komponistin aus Deutschland und brauche dringend Ihre Unterstützung, um das nächste Album Projekt unseres Quartetts (<b>KA MA Quartet - „A Love Supreme / Universal Tone“ - A Tribute to John Coltrane</b>) sorgenlos abschließen zu können. </p>
<p>
</p><h3>Kurze Info zum Album:</h3><p>Nach drei weltweit veröffentlichten Alben und einer limitierten Vinyl Ausgabe eines Studiokonzerts in den Bauer Studios plant unser <b>KA MA Quartet</b> jetzt erstmalig die Veröffentlichung eines Tribute Albums „A Love Supreme / Universal Tone“ zu Ehren von Saxophonist John Coltrane. Auf diesem Album gibt es neben neuen Stücken des Quartetts eine neue Interpretationen der legendären Suite „A Love Supreme“ von John Coltrane zu hören. Als Gast für die Produktion konnten wir den indonesischen Percussionisten <b>Nippy Noya</b>, einen der bekanntesten Conga- Spieler/Legenden in Europa, gewinnen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Das KA MA Quartet ist ein Bandprojekt, in das ich die letzten zehn Jahre investiert habe und all meine Energie reingesteckt habe. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Das bedeutet u.a. komponieren, proben, Managementarbeit, Konzertbooking und Alben für die Band produzieren. Es ist für Jazz Musiker generell nicht leicht, ein eigenes Projekt auf den Markt zu bringen. Die Album Produktionen kosten eine Menge Geld, welches man als ausübender Musiker aber nur schwerlich verdient. </span></p>
<p><i>Das neue Album bedeutet uns extrem viel! </i></p><p>Wir wollen mit diesem Tribute Album in erster Linie John Coltrane für seine Musik und ebenso kraftvollen Aussagen danken. Die legendäre Suite  „A Love Supreme“ hat eine immense Kraft und in gewisser Weise auch eine „reinigende, heilende“ Wirkung auf uns. Sie hat uns schon in vielen Situationen beigestanden, so dass es uns ein Bedürfnis war, diese Musik einmal selbst zu spielen.</p><p>Die Idee für dieses Album und auch das Arrangement der Suite kam letztendlich von unserem Gitarristen Nils Pollheide und stieß bei allen auf Begeisterung, insbesondere nachdem wir uns das erste Mal getroffen haben, um diese Suite zu spielen. Denn beim Spielen dieser Suite ging es uns vor allem um das musikalische Zusammenspiel und das Freisetzen von Energie. Wir danken auch Nippy Noya für seine musikalische und inspirierende Unterstützung bei diesem Projekt.</p>

It will feature new interpretations of John Coltrane’s legendary suite „A Love Supreme“.

<p>
</p><p>The KA MA Quartet is a jazz band, I put all my efforts in over the whole last 10 years. It is a long hard way for jazz musicians to move their project forward. It is hard to pay the money for new albums and to earn money as a musician in general and also to do the booking work for the project. <br/>
<br/>
I believe in this new album called ""A love supreme / Universal Tone"". It means really much to me:</p>
<p>We wanted to record this music, because the music of John Coltrane has such a great impact! It is music, which helps you in bad situations and even haves a curative effect.

<p>The album is already recorded, mixed and mastered. </p>
<p>But I need your help to release and promote it. The conditions for jazz musicians, to earn money with jazz concerts and teaching are that bad, that it becomes more and more difficult for me to produce new albums. And concerning album productions it is for most jazz musicians normal, that they invest really much money in productions, but don't earn money with it. </p>

<p>
</p><p>The record label is necessary to make the album available in record stores and in the internet. The promotor is important for us to promote the album in germany and to make it public.<br/>
If I would reach the whole amount of 6000€, I don't have to overdraw my bank account that much, and I will try to save more money to release the album at a later time also on vinyl.....or organize some more concerts for the quartet with Nippy Noya.....and at least the work for the next album can start, when this one is released.</p>

The conditions for jazz musicians, to earn money with jazz concerts and teaching are that bad, that it becomes more and more difficult for me to produce new albums. And concerning album productions it is for most jazz musicians normal, that they invest really much money in productions, but don't earn money with it. 

(If you are interested: Here is an actual study about jazz musicians work condition:
http://www.ndr.de/kultur/musik/jazz/Studie-zu-Arbeitsbedingungen-von-Jazzmusikern,studie240.html)
(And at least John Scofield said: you can start to earn some money with your own music if you manage to release 7 albums. Please help me with no 5, so I don't need to bug you guys anymore;) 
What I need:

I try to reach a goal of 6000€. 

I already covered:the recording studio (3 days) Fattoria Musica in Osnabrück the engineerthe mix by Adrian von Riepka at Bauer Studios Ludwigsburgthe master by patch musicthe photograph and at least the video 

What I still need money for, in total 6000€, less than I already spend:the record labelthe artworkthe promotor

The record label is necessary to make the album available in record stores and in the internet. The promotor is important for us to promote the album in germany and to make it public.
If I would reach the whole amount of 6000€, I don't have to overdraw my bank account that much, and I will try to save more money to release the album at a later time also on vinyl.....or organize some more concerts for the quartet with Nippy Noya.....and at least the work for the next album can start, when this one is released.
Thank you so much for your help!

<p>In the late 1990s I recorded two CDs of solo compositions for acoustic harmonica, ""The Act of Being Free in One Act"" and ""The Second Act of Free Being,"" that are unlike anything recorded before or since.  The critically celebrated compositions on those records have been featured in films, TV, stage productions, independent radio, and original choreography.  In the early 2000s I began working with the multiFX devices produced by Digitech and others, and this recording represents my first full-length record of songs that use my electronic sounds and advanced harmonica techniques to drive a rock band.  </p>
<p>I've had a lot of time to work on it.  My performing career was cut short in 2002 when my wife was nearly killed by a physician's error.  In between session gigs, I've focused on developing my electronic sounds and incorporating my advanced harmonica techniques into the language of rock.  I'm ready to lay it all down.  </p>
<p>I've signed on Ed Abbiati, leader of the <a href=""http://www.lowlandsband.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Lowlands band,</a> whose records I've played on since 2008, to produce the record, and I've got <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Brenner"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Mike ""SloMo"" Brenner,</a> with whom I've played on several of Ed's records, to play lap steel guitar.</p>
<p>Together, we're going to make a record that's dark and driving, something that lives in the intersection of Morphine, Little Walter, and the White Stripes. The goal is to define the role of harmonica in amplified music for the 21st century. </p>

<p><br/>Dear Dïetheads, as you're most likely already aware of, our debut album Rest In Sleaze just turned 10 years old and we want to celebrate this with you!</p>
<p>This was the album that started it all, back in 2005, and a vinyl edition have been frequently requested by fans ever since it first came out on CD. We're now extremely pleased over the fact that we will be able to purchase the licensing rights straight from Universal, which means that we have permission to release a worldwide limited edition of 1.000 vinyls.</p>
<p>However, this means that there are costs involved that we usually don't have to deal with, such as Universal royalty fees (€4000), a proper remaster for vinyl (€1000), artwork adapted for gatefold vinyl (€350), professionally shot band photos from 2005 (never published before) (€200), just to name a few. Another challenge with vinyl in general is the shipping cost we have to add to every order, that we cannot do much about - shipping vinyl worldwide from Sweden is retartedly expensive...</p>
<p>Still... We don't feel comfortable letting any other record company release this for us. Control freaks as we are, we really want to do this ourselves, but counting all the factors above, this is a high risk project, which is why we chose to once again, reach out to you - our dear fans - to help us out. </p>
<p>This is an ""ALL OR NOTHING"" campaign, meaning that unless we reach our €5000 goal, all your money will be paid back in full and the project will be canceled or put on hold.</p>
<p>Reserve your copy now, make this happen, celebrate with us and never forget the Dave Lepard legacy.</p>

<h3>Behind the Sun - Brewed in Scotland, bottled in Germany!</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>I am really happy and excited to be able to announce the release of my debut album ‘Behind the Sun‘ First off though,  I'm launching this crowdfunding campaign to help raise the funds needed to get the album out.</p>
<p>Recorded in a studio in the sleepy little village of Steinbach in Northern Bavaria, the village is affectionately known  in the local vernacular as '<strong>Hinner de Sunn</strong>' which lends itself to the title of the album.</p>
<p>So why Crowdfunding? Well, It takes a lot of time, effort and money to make professional sounding, well-arranged recordings. Studio time, engineering fees, production costs, all of this costs money. The bottom line is that without a certain amount of pre-sales via a campaign such as this, I would not be in a position financially to meet the cost of production and release of this album.</p>
<p>By offering the chance to be a vital part of this process, you will receive a copy of the album before the official release-date, on CD and download. You will be part of a community-based project borne from hard work, devotion and a genuine love of music. Perhaps, more importantly, you will know that you helped make it all possible! With your help I will be able to bring this project to it’s rightful conclusion and get the songs released.</p>
<p>There are a number of ways you can get involved and also a number of unique and exciting perks &amp; rewards that I hope will encourage support for the campaign. From CD’s, artwork and other merchandise, to house concert’s, music workshops, guitar lessons and singing sessions.</p>
<p><strong>This Campaign will run for a total of 40 days ending on the 19/11/2017!!!<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1508576386/flyxgrswbeynlhqulopr.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left;""/></strong></p>

<h3><strong>Behind the Sun – Gebraut in Schottland, abgefüllt in Deutschland!</strong></h3>
<p>Ich freue mich unwahrscheinlich, dass mein Debut-Album „Behind the Sun“ endlich veröffentlicht werden kann. Um den letzten Schritt dieser langen Reise realisieren zu können, habe ich dieses crowdfunding-Projekt ins Leben gerufen.</p>
<p>Das Album wurde in einem Studio in dem verschlafenen, kleinen Dorf Steinbach in Unterfranken aufgenommen. Bei den Einheimischen ist Steinbach auch unter dem Namen „Hinner de Sunn“, also „Hinter der Sonne“ bekannt, ein Spitzname, der schließlich namensgebend für mein Album war.</p>
<p>Nun also die Frage: Warum crowdfunding? Nun ja, ein Album kostet eine Menge Zeit, Arbeit und Geld. Gerade um einen professionellen Sound, stimmige Aufnahmen, Studiozeit und Produktionskosten abzudecken, muss man einiges an Geld in die Hand nehmen. Daraus resultiert, dass ich, ohne den Vorverkauf mittels einer Kampagne wie dieser, nicht in der Lage wäre, die Kosten für die Produktion und Veröffentlichung dieses Albums zu stemmen.</p>
<p>Wenn du dich als Teil dieser Kampagne einbringst, wirst du das Album noch vor der offiziellen Veröffentlichung als Download und als „echte“ CD erhalten. Somit wirst du Teil eines Projektes sein, das aus richtig harter Arbeit, Hingabe und ehrlicher Liebe zur Musik entstanden ist. Vielleicht ist es sogar noch schöner, wenn du weißt, dass dies alles nur mit deiner Hilfe möglich geworden ist. Dank dir werde ich es schaffen, dieses Projekt zu Ende zu führen und die Songs zu veröffentlichen.</p>
<p>Es gibt einige Möglichkeiten, um dich in das Projekt einzubringen und auch so einige wunderbare Prämien, die du bekommen kannst und die dich hoffentlich noch mehr an meinem Projekt teilhaben lassen wollen. Da gibt es CD’s, Zeichnungen, prall gefüllte Goodie Bags und natürlich auch Hauskonzerte, Musik-Workshops, Gitarren- und Gesangsunterricht.</p>
<p><strong>Diese Kampagne wird insgesamt 40 Tage dauern und endet am 19/11/2017!!!</strong></p>

<h3><strong>The songs and the Musicians</strong></h3>
<p>The songs are all original material. Written &amp; composed by myself so as such they are very close to my heart. To have the chance to make these recordings with both gifted musicians and down-to-earth people, is something really special. All musicians on the album, bar one, came from the local area in and around Aschaffenburg and every one helped bring to life the stories, tales and emotions that lay behind each song.</p>
<p>This collection of material consists of fourteen songs, recorded with fourteen different musicians, over a period of fourteen weeks...... give or take a day's recording here and there!</p>
<p>Each musician had a part to play in this, each one put a little bit of their heart and soul into the recordings and each of them helped to make this something really special. I would love to see these songs shared with as wide an audience of listeners as possible and so have started this crowdfunding project to help make that happen.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Die Songs und die Musiker</h3>
<p>Auf dem Album findest du nur ehrliche und echte Songs, die ich alle selbst geschrieben und komponiert habe. Dass ich dann die Möglichkeit hatte, meine Songs, die eine Herzensangelegenheit darstellen, mit sowohl unglaublich talentierten aber dennoch vollkommen geerdeten Musikerinnen und Musikern aufnehmen durfte, macht es umso besonders. Alle von ihnen, bis auf einen, kommen aus der Region um und in Aschaffenburg und jeder einzelne von ihnen hat eigene Geschichten, Gedanken und Gefühle mit in jeden Song gebracht.</p>
<p>So besteht diese Sammlung nun aus vierzehn Liedern, die mit vierzehn verschiedenen Musikerinnen und Musikern in vierzehn Wochen aufgenommen wurden. Plus minus ein oder zwei Tage, wer will hier schon so genau sein.</p>
<p>Jeder und jede einzelne der Musikerinnen und Musiker hat seinen oder ihren ganz eigenen Beitrag zu diesem Album beigesteuert und somit jedes Mal ein Stück Herz und Seele in dieses Album gesteckt. Damit wurde es zu etwas Einzigartigem und ganz Besonderem. Gerade deswegen liegt es mir besonders am Herzen, diese Songs mit möglichst vielen anderen Menschen, denen ehrliche Musik etwas bedeutet, zu teilen. Deshalb habe ich dieses Projekt gestartet, nämlich damit du und noch viele andere diese Musik hören können.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>Recording Process</strong></h3>
<p>All tracks on the album were recorded and produced by <strong>Michael Hauck</strong> from Loch Less Studio in Steinbach. A sleepy wee village just outside the town of Aschaffenburg.  These are real quality, professional recordings. Beautifully arranged and mixed to a very high standard. I am sure everyone who listens would agree, even if it's not your cup of tea.</p>
<p>The Album has been recorded and is now in the final mixing &amp; mastering phase, which I plan to have complete by Autumn 2017. This will coincide with the end-phase of the crowdfunding campaign when the CD production will begin.</p>
<p>To date, recording these songs with so many great musicians brought some of the proudest and satisfying moments into my life. It was a lot of effort and hard work at times, but it has also been a most enjoyable and enlightening journey which I will never forget.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Die Aufnahme</h3>
<p>Produziert und aufgenommen wurden alle Songs des Albums von <strong>Michael Hauck</strong> im Loch Less Studio in Steinbach, dem verschlafenen Dorf gerade hinter Aschaffenburg. Dank Michel zeugen die Aufnahmen von besonderer Qualität und Professionalität. Er hat es geschafft, alle Songs außergewöhnlich gut zu arrangieren und abzumischen und ich glaube, dass jeder, der dieses Album anhören wird, mir hierzu vollste Zustimmung geben wird. Und das selbst wenn die Musik an sich nicht dein Ding sein sollte.</p>
<p>Nach der langen Aufnahmezeit, befindet sich das Album jetzt in der finalen „Mixing &amp; Mastering“-Phase, das heißt, es bekommt seinen Feinschliff. Die komplette Fertigstellung geht somit mit dem Beginn des crowdfunding-Projekts einher. Von daher steht der CD-Produktion nichts mehr im Wege.</p>
<p>Ich kann die Zeit, als ich dieses Album mit all diesen großartigen Musikerinnen und Musikern aufgenommen habe, zu den stolzesten und zufriedensten Zeiten meines Lebens zählen. Natürlich war es auch jede Menge Arbeit und Anstrengung, aber das war es definitiv wert, denn dies war so eine bereichernde Erfahrung, die ich niemals vergessen werde und will.</p>

<h3>Was wir brauchen und was du bekommst</h3>
<p>Ich brauche Unterstützung, um das Aufnahmestudio, das Abmischen und Mastern, zu finanzieren.

<p>Aber auch wenn du gerade nicht die Möglichkeit hast, mich finanziell zu unterstützen, kannst du trotzdem helfen, indem du meine Kampagne mit deiner Familie und deinen Freunden teilst und allen davon erzählst, von denen du glaubst, dass es sie interessieren könnte.

Das Ziel ist es, 5000£ zu erreichen. Jeder einzelne Cent wird nur dazu genutzt werden, das Projekt zu finanzieren. Dieses Ziel zu erreichen, oder sogar noch mehr, wäre absolut unglaublich. Das würde mir auch noch mehr Spielraum geben und umso sicherer wäre ein erfolgreicher Verlauf. Jeder Cent zählt und wird dort genutzt werden, wo er am meisten gebraucht wird.
Jeder einzelne von euch, der Teil des Projektes wird, wird regelmäßig über die sozialen Medien oder Email-Newsletter über den Verlauf der Kampagne informiert werden, sodass du immer genau weißt, was wann passiert.",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Stretch goal (Professional Launch):</h3>
<p>We have raised enough money to cover the studio and our star musician, plus rentals and travel. Now help us to give a little something to each of the musicians (4 total and not including me) and get professional mastering by our old friend Andy Vandette (Sevendust, Beastie Boys, David Bowie, Procupine Tree.) $450 Mastering, artwork, packaging, and digital distribution to iTunes, Amazon, Spotify and other digital streaming services. Can we reach $2000?</p>
<h3>Goal Reached!</h3>
<p>You made it happen - we reached our target in 72 hours. The project is moving ahead this weekend! Se update 3 for the amazing lineup this has made possible!</p>
<h3>Keram Songs</h3>
<p>Keram is not only a musician and lyricist, but a producer who has a keen eye and ear for remarkable talents that have rare and unusual qualities. He never plays it safe but rather seeks to turn unexpected corners and evoke unnamed sensations and emotions. His productions are densely layered and full of secrets. While he has released many demos, his professionally recorded  and mastered catalog is very lean for a three-decade career and every new collaboration reveals a new facet to this spectrum of ideas and talent pool. This campaign seeks to capitalize on a brief window of time where Keram may be able to record with two of his most potent musical partners. With your support, this campaign will make that possible.</p>
<ul>
<li>Since the release of Come to Life in 2014 - the 7-year journey that led to  a ten song 76 minute album featuring 32 musicians including Ryan Brown (drummer for Dweezil Zappa) and guitarists Marc Thomas, Pete Devlin (Blue Dog Pict), Alex Budman (D'Angelo) and Alex Lifeson  (RUSH), singer, composer and producer Keram has released only one single ""(Don't Get Caught) By The Dazzling Charades"" whose creation he streamed from inception to competed mix live on Periscope over the internet, sharing with his supporters every painstaking moment of the process, unedited.</li>
<li>After an almost two year sabbatical from music to create VRTO and FIVARS - two of the world's prominent Virtual Reality events, Keram now has a rare opportunity to reunite with his collaborators Ryan Brown, fresh off a tour with Dweezil Zappa and master guitarist Marc Thomas in Los Angeles in a two week window, to track two new songs that reflect Keram's current musical ideas. This unique trio will be assisted in the studio by a group of stellar musicians and engineers (suprises to follow) to produce two professionally recorded and produced works for release.</li>
<li>It is only through the financial support of people like you that such new works are made possible and add the eternal catalog of songs left behind. For only a few dollrs we can meet the target goal and make this happen.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We only have until May 19th to get into the studio!</p>
<ul>
<li>$275 Studio Time. $700 musicians honorarium, travel, rentals. $100 magnetic tape.</li>
<li>This is the ground level total needed to make it possible in such short time. Our stretch goals will add more time to track and mix and bring in additional 3rd party live talent from Los Angeles.</li>
<li>Funds are needed to rent a professional tape and digital recording studio filled with vintage gear and unique instruments and mixing console to create a rich, textured sound that will lend itself to many repeat listens and authentic human vibe.</li>
<li>Your name will be included on a this website as contributor and on any music videos that emerge from the creation of these songs.</li>
<li>If the target goal isn't met, one less song will be recorded and mastered. If less than that is acheived, only drum tracks will be captured while the opportunity it there.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Keram has never pulled punches in his thematic ideas, but also find a lyrical style that uses turns of phrase to create multilevel meaning and metaphor that can and should be unpacked over multiple listens and consideration. This is a dangerous and volatile time in history but also one that exudes innovation and transcendance. This is a moment for artists to express powerful ideas to inspire, questions, challenge and soothe, to invoke imagination, spirit, and dreams.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Keram finishes what he sets out to do. Having founded and run the Constant Change Music label since 1991 he has produced and licensed songs to EPCOT Centre, SONY, Disney, Hallmark, CBC, PixL, MGM, New Line and many more. His scores have appeared on television dramas and experimental short films alike. His stage shows are unpredicatable, and passionate and have earned critical acclaim.  However the music industry has changed and the traditional support structures and outlets to be heard are highly fractured and diverse. Though this is positive in many ways, it also makes financing new works daunting at best. Thus we believe in the structure of patronage to support new works. If we do not raise the funding to pay for studios, then we miss the opportunty to capture the lightining in a bottle of lifetime-musicians disocovering and capturing incredible moment together.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you really are not able to spare some change or a few dollars but still really want to make this happen you can help out by sharing this capmaign with your friends on social media and email, We recommend a few personal words from you about why you feel supporting the capture of such new works meaningful to you and to the society.</p>
</div><p>And that's all there is to it! Let's make this happen, and thank you always for your loving and incredible suppoort and encouragement to produce art and ideas and release them into the cosmos.</p></div>","Stretch goal (Professional Launch):

<p>Hello Friends,</p>
<p>My name is Dakota Hall Scott. For several years now I have been, accidentally, and only recently known to me, writing songs that have encapsulated what it was like for me to grow up in Bakersfield, CA. Of course, the themes found in these songs move to deeper places than simply where I grew up.

<p>After some relative success with my first full length album (My Body Longed For The Summer) I want to build off what I learned during the making of that album. With your help, I want to put what is in my mind and my fingers and soul into the world for all to hear. </p>

<h3>The Album</h3>
<p>This project brings to fruition a period of exploration of a new musical direction for me. It means a lot to me and my close friends and family, who have heard these songs over and over. The fact that they haven't thrown out my guitar or kicked me out of the house is a good sign! Contributing to my campaign will help make the album a reality, and by doing so hopefully touch listeners by the music. You already know music can impact people in ways few other art forms can, and my hope is these songs will dig deep into people's emotions. They convey stories that are real, sometimes too real. This music to me is at the same time inspiring, frustrating, and joyful.</p>
<h3>Who I am</h3>
<p>I've been a musician my whole life - since I could make sounds I was probably singing and banging on stuff. I've always been a drummer, playing music from around the world (Korea Cuba, Peru, and the US of course). But I never really considered myself a songwriter until a few years ago, when I began writing music for my kids. Then I discovered something I never really knew I had in me: writing and playing music that was really simple that could communicate to listeners aspects of regular life. I found that giving people a reflection of the world they live in can be powerful. It transforms the way I look at the world around me, and can do the same for listeners.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need to Finish</h3>
<p>I'm hoping to raise $1,200 to pay for finishing up the album. It is fully recorded, and almost entirely mixed. I'm entering the final mastering stage, which is the stage in the recording process that cleans up the sound making it really pop. Most funds will go to finishing up the mixing process and mastering the full album. Some of the funds will go to publishing the music digitally.</p>
</div><div> </div><div>
<h3>If you can't contribute financially...</h3>
<p>Hey that's totally fine! If you are into the project and like the music you hear, you will have the opportunity to listen to the final product on various digital platforms, including Spotify, Pandora, Bandcamp, iTunes, etc. And you can share this campaign with friends that you think would be interested.</p>

What was even more amazing, was that he did it for FREE!</p>
<p>By now, many of you have seen his incredible work either on Facebook, the USAG website or in event posters - including this year's Finals artwork. He wants to do this again, but he needs a little help footing the bill to Kansas City for the weekend.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What he needs to make this happen</h3> <p>Plane tickets from Sacramento are expensive, and so is flying with all of his camera equipment. To help offset this cost and to pay him for his amazing work, we are offering up a series of Perks to help pay his way and help get you the most amazing air guitar photo of your career. This is a flex-fund account and we are looking to get him at least $200 for his work. </p>
</div> <div> <h3>How can I help? How do I get a photo?</h3> <p>If you'd like to help the cause and get a portrait, please select one of the following perks when you donate. Also, please be sure to use your Air Guitar Name when posting your donation. This is done at the end of the donation process. That way we know what Perk you selected!</p> <ul>
<li>
<b>Portrait Session 1 - $10</b><br/>This gets you a 3 minute portrait session, a digital copy of a professionally edited photo, and an 8x10 printed portrait*</li> <li>
<b>Portrait Session 2 - $15</b><br/>This gets you everything from Portrait Session 1, plus digital copies of all of the raw photos taken during your session</li>
<li>
<b>Portrait Session 3 - $25<br/></b>This gets you everything from Portrait Session 2, plus a digital 2014 US Air Guitar Trading Card, designed by Lt. Facemelter**<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<div>*<i>Sweetness will select the best photo from the session to edit for your official portrait. All editing and design decisions will be made solely by Sweetness. Your printed portrait will be mailed to you approximately one month after the Finals.<br/><br/></i>
</div>
<div><i>**The trading card will use your official portrait for the front. If a back is desired, Lt. Facemelter will work with you to get all information necessary for your attributes and bio.<br/><br/></i></div>
<div>
<h3>I'm on a budget. Can I still get a photo taken for less than $10?</h3>
<p>Here's the deal. If Sweetness can raise $200 or more, he will open up the photo session to ALL air guitarists. So if you can't swing $10, feel free to donate anything less to help contribute to the cause! If the $200 mark is hit, here's what happens:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Priority is given to those who paid for a photo session. Sweetness will have a list of who paid and will make sure they get their photos taken first.</li>

</div></div>","Background Info - 2013 US Air Guitar Finals Last year Sweetness (Kyle Privette) was kind and talented enough to do a professional photo shoot of the National Finalists and additional air guitarists who had backstage access. What was even more amazing, was that he did it for FREE!
By now, many of you have seen his incredible work either on Facebook, the USAG website or in event posters - including this year's Finals artwork. He wants to do this again, but he needs a little help footing the bill to Kansas City for the weekend.   What he needs to make this happen Plane tickets from Sacramento are expensive, and so is flying with all of his camera equipment. To help offset this cost and to pay him for his amazing work, we are offering up a series of Perks to help pay his way and help get you the most amazing air guitar photo of your career. This is a flex-fund account and we are looking to get him at least $200 for his work. 
  How can I help? How do I get a photo? If you'd like to help the cause and get a portrait, please select one of the following perks when you donate. Also, please be sure to use your Air Guitar Name when posting your donation. This is done at the end of the donation process. That way we know what Perk you selected! 

Portrait Session 1 - $10This gets you a 3 minute portrait session, a digital copy of a professionally edited photo, and an 8x10 printed portrait* 
Portrait Session 2 - $15This gets you everything from Portrait Session 1, plus digital copies of all of the raw photos taken during your session

Portrait Session 3 - $25This gets you everything from Portrait Session 2, plus a digital 2014 US Air Guitar Trading Card, designed by Lt. Facemelter**


*Sweetness will select the best photo from the session to edit for your official portrait. All editing and design decisions will be made solely by Sweetness. Your printed portrait will be mailed to you approximately one month after the Finals.

**The trading card will use your official portrait for the front. If a back is desired, Lt. Facemelter will work with you to get all information necessary for your attributes and bio.

I'm on a budget. Can I still get a photo taken for less than $10?
Here's the deal. If Sweetness can raise $200 or more, he will open up the photo session to ALL air guitarists. So if you can't swing $10, feel free to donate anything less to help contribute to the cause! If the $200 mark is hit, here's what happens:


Priority is given to those who paid for a photo session. Sweetness will have a list of who paid and will make sure they get their photos taken first.
If you did not pay for a photo session, you will be photographed on a first come-first serve basis. You will get a 2 minute session and you will receive a single raw digital photo, selected by Sweetness. Even without the professional design edits, it will still look pretty damn awesome!






Can I donate without getting a Perk?
Absolutely! If you'd like to donate a few dollars just to help the cause, please do so! You are also more than welcome to donate extra money on top of the Perk you've already selected.

<p>I mean, the fella must. Otherwise, he wouldn't be making the Mets lose so much. I don't know about you, but I think it's time that the we got some new ownership in there. Someone who was hardened and real and a freaking dude. Someone like me. </p>
<p>My name is Carlton Krinkle, and I want to buy the New York Mets. </p>
<p>You're probably thinking, ""Who is this guy?"" Well, all right, then. I'm just a dude like any other dude, only more so. I served in the military in 'Nam and then triumphed over a drinking habit and a nasty divorce. Point is I know what it's like to stare darkness in the face in the bleakest of times and come out on top. </p>
<p>That's the sort of rugged lumberjacking mountain-climbing can-do-ness that I'd like to pass onto the New York Mets. The Wilpans ain't getting it done. How many losing seasons has it been now? I honestly don't feel like looking it up right, but it's been a a whole bunch. It's time to pass the baton onto a regular ol' dude who is gonna make the hard choices and put a winning ball club on the field. </p> </div> <div> <h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>Most people would ask for millions of dollars or probably billions, but at least 90 percent of that would go to lawyers. Ever since my ex-wife took my house in our divorce, I would never hire a lawyer again. So that really cuts down overhead. </p>
<p>What I need is simple: $5,000 and two chairs: this Wilpon fella in one of them and me in the other one. </p>
<p>I have a little inside information. I heard that the Wilpons are poor from the Barney Maroff pyramid scam, so the $5,000 combined with my fierce negotiating tactics, I'm pretty sure I can get a deal done to taking controlling interest of the Mets. </p>
<p>I promise that however much money we raise here, I will make a formal, written offer to the Wilpans to buy the team, and I will keep all of you in the loop on my messages, phone calls, and responses with the Mets. </p>
<p>If I'm successful, you'd also get a damn good Mets team. I'm a people-person and and am sure I can deliver a team full of dudes who do nothing but throw and pole axe baseballs. I'd also like to add that you'd get a say in how the team is run and get some of the credit, but honestly I'm just doing this purely for personal gain.</p>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>The Mets haven't won the World Series since 1986. Most of you kids weren't even alive! The impact of my ownership is that you'd get to see the Mets win the World Series a whole lot. I know how to spot talent, and I have a way with people where they work hard and hustle for me. </div>
<div>Day 1 on the job, I cut loose all the lawyers. We do things on a handshake agreement from now, so people can relax and just do a good job. I'd also promote catching thundermonster Kevin Platwecki to the majors because that guy is a dude. I have some other ideas, but those are the main ones for now. </div>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>I hate considering failure because that's what quitters do, but yeah, I guess that this could bomb and I can't buy the Mets. You'd be risking that they turn me down and I spent your money on whiskey. I'd like to think it takes a man to admit this, so hopefully you'll read this and be like, ""Damn, this dude's a straight shooter that I can respect.""</p>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>Pretty much you can just send me some money or tell your neighbors or wealthy friends about this. </p>

The album sounds fantastic and we are ready to have CDs duplicated.We scraped the funds together to pay for the recording sessions in Nashville and it turned out great ! We never expected to find a voice to match these original songs so perfectly ! this is where we need your help ! In order to get this music out there we need product to sell ! we've got people wanting to buy cds right now however we are underfunded to accomplish this just yet We never dreamed in a million years that this project could actually become a reality.This album has something for all ages on it to enjoy. Any donation that you csn make to help us when we are so close to seeing this dream come to fruition will be greatly appreciated . This is real music written from the heart and we cant wait for everyone to have a listen .. (7-26-14). Thanks for checking out our funding site. We are SeaCork Music, a small hometown outfit with years worth of writings and world class local talent. We created this small company to bring songs and singers together. Our goal is to share our music and give these new artists an opportunity to showcase their talent and potential and go straight to the studio and produce an album. At this time, we have three albums lined up............... Our first is with Brandon Hogue. Our second is with Caitlen Lee and our third is with Matt Cowart. The genre for Brandon and Caitlen is country. Matt is a gospel singer and his will be a gospel album. Songs selected for the first two albums have already been sent to our session leader in Nashville......they have meaningful lyrics and good music behind them.....his reply was ""these songs are good, a few of them may even be great! That was nice to hear from a Nashville veteran!................This campaign will do much more than just help complete three albums. This is something these young artists will have for the rest of their lives and will create a platform for these unheard songs to be shared. No song is heard until it has been sung. Our goal is to continue to seek out great talent  and let them be heard............   Mississippi has long been known for it's musical writers, influence and artists. We want to continue that tradition. With your help, we can do just that! .............What We Need &amp; What You Get.........Costs for the production of these THREE albums are $23,700.  We work out of a home office and do not need to upgrade or purchase anything for the office. Songs have already been registered and are under copyright......... Each and every amount funded will be used strictly for the production of these albums..........We offer perks that range from CD's and downloads to Skype sessions and T-Shirts to autographed CD's and Lyrics, an invitation to the studio, to Co- Producer and Co- Executive Producer credits. Any amounts funded that do not reach our funding goal will by applied to Brandon's album, Caitlen's album and Matt's album....in that order....... Any funding that exceeds our goal will be put towards the next album or albums by talented singers with our songs or theirs. We promise to bring you only the best that we can find. The IMPACT........Long before your favorite artists became popular and took the world by storm, they probably dabbled in some songwriting and played to their friends and family. The talent was there but no one had heard of them or heard their songs........ Only with your help can we get these songs and artists shared to the world. We have been searching for the right voices for over two years and I will tell you, when we heard each of these singers open their mouths to sing, our jaws dropped. Talk about talent! We were amazed and are proud to be a part of their musical lives. Your funding will impact them for life and will be life changing for them......... We are not a big record label and don't want to be. We have signed contracts and have given our artists generous royalties. If they get the opportunity to go big with another label, we will be happy for them......that fits in to our goal of bringing new artists to light....... If they go big and want to stay with us, we will do the very best that we can for them. Either way, we want them to be successful. Risks and  Challenges: The RISKS we face is not being able to share our total vision and having to put any of these young artists on hold by not reaching our funding goal. It is a huge undertaking to attempt to create what has been a work in progress for many years. We are at the final stages and are hopeful that there are enough people out there that support new music and new artists....... We are 100% confident in what we can produce. What we have to work with are good songs and very talented singers along with our drive and determination to get these three albums completed. We are working with some of the best musicians Nashville has to offer and we are positive we will be extremely proud of the final product and with your help, you can be proud too for being a part of it!...........There are more ways than contributing financially that you can help us reach our goal. Just SHARE our campaign with your friends and ask them to do the same. We are running this campaign for sixty days so there is time to share it more than once if you care to.........

<div>They Will Fall is a 5-piece metalcore/hardcore band based out of West Monroe, Louisiana (US). Established in 2010, They Will Fall has served as a breath of fresh air for a scene so widely saturated with repetitive and dull sounds. Having released a debut full-length entitled ""Disrupt the World"" in 2012 (funded through Kickstarter), followed by the groundbreaking ""Misconceptions EP"" in September 2013, They Will Fall has been creating waves of excitement in waters that haven't been stirred in such a manner for a long time. Playing in front of acts such as Becoming the Archetype, Mouth of the South, Colossus, Silent Planet, Darkness Divided, Kublai Khan, Stand Your Ground, The Paramedic, and many more, West Monroe's They Will Fall possesses an impressive repertoire that matches with the best of today's hottest national touring acts. <br/><br/>Now, They Will Fall is preparing to record a ten-song album set to release in 2015 and needs YOUR help! Bound to surpass expectations, transcend ideals, and ultimately break ground in such a dry and overplayed genre.... </div>
<h4 style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>This is the album you've been waiting for.</b></span></h4> </div> <div> <h3>The Scoop</h3>
<div>We'll be heading into the studio mid-November with Eric Woolard of Premier Productions in Jackson, MS, with whom we recorded 2012's Disrupt the World and 2013's Misconceptions EP.

<div>This is an expensive endeavor for They Will Fall: quality recording always is. While $7,000 is a <i>steep</i> goal to shoot for, we are being as realistic and as transparent as we can. Every last penny of the 7,000 dollars we hope to raise will go directly toward the completion of this album; if we are able to generate more, the extra money will <b><i>absolutely</i></b> help to make the album and the details surrounding the process much more enjoyable for our listeners and supporters! If we don't reach our goal, we will still use every penny to make this album the best it can be. <b>Your investment</b> will directly benefit the overall impact and long-lasting effect that this album will have.</div>

</div> <div> <h3>What's so special about this album?</h3>
<div>Four years ago, They Will Fall began as a small project consisting of immature teenagers who followed their passions. From small shows in our hometown to packed out shows hours away, from touring to two different releases in just two years, They Will Fall has grown both in skill and wisdom at a furious rate. And now, as we prepare to hit the studio to record this next full-length and our third release, we look back on a year filled with some of the most challenging times in our lives for us, both as individuals and as a band. </div>
<div>Writing this album consisted of the latest nights we have ever experienced, as ideas for new material would keep us wide awake. We have spent countless hours running back and forth between riffs and lyrics in order to solidify the perfect sound, a process that has left us exhausted and breathless. Material we thought was our best 6 months ago has been trashed and replaced. Struggling between self-worth and self-defeat and trusting in God through it all... While wish we could say that finishing this album was easy, we have learned that authoring and composing quality material is nothing but difficult.</div>
<div>But now, as we have reached a point of completion, we are able to say that <b>the reward of finishing what we have started COMPLETELY outweighs the costs and the sacrifices we have made to get here</b>. Looking forward to recording and releasing this full-length is an understatement on our end: to us, it seems that everything before this album has just been a foundation for what we are about to display. We could not be more excited about this album, and we are thrilled that you can partner with us and be directly responsible for making it happen!</div>

</div> <div> <h3>Convictions</h3> <p>Our band is driven by our faith as individuals in the saving and redemptive power of Jesus Christ. We believe in seeking objective truth and not stopping until you find it. We are convinced that the Gospel of Jesus Christ and the God of the Bible is truth, and trusting in and becoming more like Christ is our lifestyle and our endeavor, both as individuals in a band and as a mouthpiece for God through music.</p>

Three and a half years in Nashville has lead me to this point.
 Publishers, pitch meetings, co-writes, showcases and countless four hour
sets on Broadway; all of it has lead to this project and this group of songs.
 I have been very fortunate to play music in Nashville full-time for about
three years now and I am confidant this project will allow me to step up to the
next level.  I have literally written hundreds of songs over the past few
years so you can imagine how difficult it was to narrow it down to 6 songs that
I believe in enough to stake my future on.  But with the help of some
publishers that I trust and a great producer we did it!  Now I'm excited
to share them with YOU!
So, now is where YOU come in!  I need your help...I have
everything in place but the funding.  I am trying to raise $6,000 to help
offset the cost of the record.  This amount is in addition to a lot of
money that I am already investing personally.  
We can do it!  Anything you can do will help...if all you
can do is share this page on all your social media then that’s great!
 Helping to spread the word is a HUGE contribution!  Please read on

The other feature that WJMAC is proud to offer is a high school jazz combo program that instructs kids on improvisation, group playing, swing, and jazz history.

It has brought together a lot of different people from different walks of life that share a common love of jazz music. They don't have to drive two hours to the big city, pay high cover charges, parking, and restaurant minimums to hear some of the best jazz musicians in the world. The venue is all ages so people can turn their children on to live music in a positive, relaxed, music focused atmosphere.

</div><div><br/></div>
<div>It's become very clear to me that my fans love my music more than any record label executive or radio DJ ever will. That's because my music is FOR them. So for that reason I have decided to put my music out through a new kind of record label that run for and by the fans. I call it The Fan Label and my specific Fan Label is called #WeRNeon. Record Labels are businesses so they are all about money. So that's why a new take on a record label has to figure out a revolutionary way to allocate the money that a traditional label dealt with. Here's our plan: the money that used to get spent on well paid executives and their staff to put out my music through a major record label will now flow into the hands of my fans who operate our Fan Label. My art department? Fans. My A&amp;R's? Fans. My executives? Fans. My collaborators? Fans. My marketing geniuses? Fans. My radio promo team? Fans. My video producers? Fans. My photographers? Fans. I think you get the picture. Anything a record label can do ... my fans can do it betta!!! </div><div><br/></div>
<div><b>Why Am I Doing This? </b></div>
<div>I spent 4 years signed to Warner Brothers. I got to see first hand what the problems are with the traditional record label. There's too many executives and they never stay the same for more than a year or so... then you are at the mercy of a whole new set of executives. Meanwhile, I've recorded enough songs with some of the world's best producers for multiple albums but only been allowed to release a handful of songs. And its not like the songs that were released weren't successful enough to warrant an album either. My singles hit #1 on Billboard twice on their Dance charts (Luv U Betta &amp; Gold), was featured on Gym Class Heroes's smash hit ""Ass Back Home"", and killed the game online with over 25 Million youtube views, over 20 million Spotify streams, tons of activity on social media, and whatever else you might expect of an emerging singer songwriter. After 4 years, 2 ownership switches, the departure of all of the team that signed me to Warner Brothers, and an album delayed for 3 years, I had to face my fans and make a decision. Go independent and take full creative control over my future, or try and slug it out as a pawn to the man. Looking back, the decision should have been very easy but at the time it was a very tough one to make. Being signed to a Major Label made me, a broke, often homeless, singer songwriter who grew up on a bus travelling with the circus, feel like I had made it. My mom and family and friends all congratulated me and told me how proud they were of me. I toured all around the world and played my dream venue Madison Square Garden. And its not like the independent record labels out there were ""cracking the code"" to the future of the music business. But then I saw some glimpses of hope like my friend Mackelmore becoming an independent superstar and artists like Amanda Palmer going to crowdfunding to fund their albums and tours. So I asked my family and friends and most importantly fans if they would support me doing something like this and the overwhelming support made me confident that I can flourish as an independent artist. So now I am running my Fan Label <a href=""http://www.werneon.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.werneon.com</a> using the same software (NationBuilder) that people use to organize political parties and grass roots movements and we are making things betta and faster than I ever did when I was signed tot he Major. </div><div><br/></div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>What Will Happen Because Your Support This Campaign </b></span></div>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">First and foremost it will allow my fans to finally get my first album Eleutheromaniac. To release the album all of the producer fees ($50k) that were previously going to be paid by Warner Brothers have to be paid. I love my producers (they are my biggest fans and vice versa) and they deserve to be paid for the work they did and their facilities which makes my music possible. The best part about this is that once we hit this level, my Fan Label #WeRNeon will then release my album everywhere... but first all of you Indiegogo contributors will get a special edition version of the album sent to you directly from me. </span><br/>
</div>
<div>The next thing this campaign will do is allow me to bring as powerful of a live show to as many of my fans as possible. If we hit the second level of the campaign ($100k) we are going to hire the fan tour team and buy the vehicles and gear needed to keep touring until I get to sing for and meet every fan of mine around the world. I live to make my fans happy and I'm so excited to go on my upcoming Yard Sale Tour and then keep on travelling to whatever places team #WeRNeon brings me to. I am a gypsy after all! Bring me to your city or country!! </div>
<div>If the campaign hits $200k then team #WeRNeon we will be shooting music videos for 3 songs and be featuring the talent and skills of my fans in each video. Fans will help with the treatment and ideas and work in each department on the video set including being featured in all of the videos. </div>
<div>If the campaign gets to $300k then it will then unlock the world's first Fan Album. I'm going to make an entire album with my super talented fans. This album will be the most collaborative album ever made and will allow us to showcase all of the talents of my wonderful Fans. My fans are incredible singers, songwriters, producers, graphic designers, and idea people... We don't need anyone but each other to make magic music!</div>
<div>If the campaign hits $500k then my fans and I will rent a huge house for a year where all of the most active members of #WeRNeon will work and live together making music and perfecting the work of the Fan Label. This will be filmed and we will release this as our own version of Big Brother that takes people inside the future of the music business and features all of us Eleutheromaniacs.</div>
<div>If the campaign hits $1Million then Fan Label will take on other artists to build their own Fan Labels. Let's think about it. Warner my old label was sold for more than $3Billion. Thats 3 thousand million dollars. So with only 0.003% of that money we can take a shot at creating the future business model for musicians and their fans.</div>

My singles hit #1 on Billboard twice on their Dance charts (Luv U Betta & Gold), was featured on Gym Class Heroes's smash hit ""Ass Back Home"", and killed the game online with over 25 Million youtube views, over 20 million Spotify streams, tons of activity on social media, and whatever else you might expect of an emerging singer songwriter. After 4 years, 2 ownership switches, the departure of all of the team that signed me to Warner Brothers, and an album delayed for 3 years, I had to face my fans and make a decision. Go independent and take full creative control over my future, or try and slug it out as a pawn to the man. Looking back, the decision should have been very easy but at the time it was a very tough one to make. Being signed to a Major Label made me, a broke, often homeless, singer songwriter who grew up on a bus travelling with the circus, feel like I had made it. My mom and family and friends all congratulated me and told me how proud they were of me. I toured all around the world and played my dream venue Madison Square Garden. And its not like the independent record labels out there were ""cracking the code"" to the future of the music business. But then I saw some glimpses of hope like my friend Mackelmore becoming an independent superstar and artists like Amanda Palmer going to crowdfunding to fund their albums and tours. So I asked my family and friends and most importantly fans if they would support me doing something like this and the overwhelming support made me confident that I can flourish as an independent artist. So now I am running my Fan Label www.werneon.com using the same software (NationBuilder) that people use to organize political parties and grass roots movements and we are making things betta and faster than I ever did when I was signed tot he Major. 
What Will Happen Because Your Support This Campaign 

First and foremost it will allow my fans to finally get my first album Eleutheromaniac. To release the album all of the producer fees ($50k) that were previously going to be paid by Warner Brothers have to be paid. I love my producers (they are my biggest fans and vice versa) and they deserve to be paid for the work they did and their facilities which makes my music possible. The best part about this is that once we hit this level, my Fan Label #WeRNeon will then release my album everywhere... but first all of you Indiegogo contributors will get a special edition version of the album sent to you directly from me. 

The next thing this campaign will do is allow me to bring as powerful of a live show to as many of my fans as possible. If we hit the second level of the campaign ($100k) we are going to hire the fan tour team and buy the vehicles and gear needed to keep touring until I get to sing for and meet every fan of mine around the world. I live to make my fans happy and I'm so excited to go on my upcoming Yard Sale Tour and then keep on travelling to whatever places team #WeRNeon brings me to. I am a gypsy after all! Bring me to your city or country!! 
If the campaign hits $200k then team #WeRNeon we will be shooting music videos for 3 songs and be featuring the talent and skills of my fans in each video. Fans will help with the treatment and ideas and work in each department on the video set including being featured in all of the videos. 
If the campaign gets to $300k then it will then unlock the world's first Fan Album. I'm going to make an entire album with my super talented fans. This album will be the most collaborative album ever made and will allow us to showcase all of the talents of my wonderful Fans. My fans are incredible singers, songwriters, producers, graphic designers, and idea people... We don't need anyone but each other to make magic music!
If the campaign hits $500k then my fans and I will rent a huge house for a year where all of the most active members of #WeRNeon will work and live together making music and perfecting the work of the Fan Label. This will be filmed and we will release this as our own version of Big Brother that takes people inside the future of the music business and features all of us Eleutheromaniacs.
If the campaign hits $1Million then Fan Label will take on other artists to build their own Fan Labels. Let's think about it. Warner my old label was sold for more than $3Billion. Thats 3 thousand million dollars. So with only 0.003% of that money we can take a shot at creating the future business model for musicians and their fans.

Here are some of the PERKS you will get for supporting this campaign!

<h3>Who We Are</h3> <p>Hello everyone! Alpha Riff here! I'm an Indie Hip-Hop/Nerdcore Artist who loves telling great stories via incredible music. I'm on IndieGoGo again to tell you guys about my brand new full-length album, Digital Champions: Migdal Bavel.</p>
<p>Digital Champions: Migdal Bavel is a 23 track Hip-Hopera about two digital bounty hunters, Alpha Riff and MZ,  and their quest to figure out why a strain of lethal C.O.D.E. is ravaging their world. Through the tale, they meet an array of incredible characters played by amazing emcees and singers. Some become allies, others enemies, but all will leave you breathless with their energetic and emotive deliveries.</p>
<p>This time around, we are looking to take the story beyond the album. We want to create trading cards, games, and more. With your help, we can achieve all of that!</p>

All of those who donate enough to get the album will get a free week of streaming before the album is released! <b>*NEW*</b> You will also get my other full length album, <b>From Beta to Alpha Riff</b>, AND <b>VI: Final Fantasy VI Tribute</b>, a 3 track instrumental album releasing on October 20, 2014 for free!

<h3>The Cast &amp; The World</h3> <p>Digital Champions: Migdal Bavel is set in the world of Digitalia, a computer based world where the Flux, humanoid-like beings, live their day to day lives. Within Digitalia are hundreds of continents and it is on the continent known only as The Zone where our story takes place. The Zone is divided into two areas: the DMZ and the Fire Wall. The DMZ is a wasteland where it is said no one can return. The Fire Wall is a tall barrier encircling an enormous area at the edge of The Zone. Within the Fire Wall is the city of I.P. It is inside of I.P. that Alpha Riff and MZ live.</p>
<p>I.P. is not the only city within the Fire Wall, but it the largest and most important. I.P. is home to billions of Flux, who go about their lives working, eating, sleeping, living, laughing, and loving just as humans do. They are ruled by a parliament, they have a military, and there is a seedy underground network of bounty hunters, mercenary, drug and arms dealers, and more doing the dirty work of corrupting politicians and assassinating their enemies.</p>
<p>It is in I.P. that we meet most of the characters in the story:</p>
<p><b>B. B. Stuart </b>- Played by TekForce (<a href=""https://soundcloud.com/tek45),"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://soundcloud.com/tek45),</a> B. B.

</div></div>","UPDATE #3: Twill Distilled has finished the official Digital Champions: Migdal Bavel poster! Check it out in full below. Featured are Alpha and MZ, Creeper who is played by Ekaj, Anti who is played by Phantastik the Phenom, and Denial the Servicer who is played by Forenus Mod.





UPDATE #2: We have officially hit our first stretch goal! That means we are 125% funded! Thank you guys so much for all of your support. This project means the world to us and we're happy that you're as excited about it as we are! Everybody who has donated thus far will receive a free poster featuring the talented Twill Distilled's artwork. Work on the poster is nearly finished but here's a look at the work in progress:






UPDATE #1: We have officially hit our 100% funding goal of $600! Thank you SO MUCH everyone! In celebration, we've released the next single, ""The Man of a Hundred Guns featuring Ish1da as Asim Billy"" at www.AlphaRiff.com! (Direct Link: The Man of a Hundred Guns ft. Ish1da) see our stretch goals below!

COMPLETED: Stretch Goal #1 - $750 - Digital Champions Poster by Twill Distilled
Our first Stretch Goal is the new Digital Champions poster being designed by Twill Distilled! Once we hit a goal of $750, everybody who donated to the IndieGoGo campaign will receive a signed version of this amazing colored poster (line art version in graphic below)!




Stretch Goal #2 - $1100 - Blue Digital Champions T-Shirt
Our second Stretch Goal is a brand new blue Digital Champions T-Shirt! For those who have a base contribution of $25 (Trading Cards + Physical Album + Red Digital Champions Shirt), you will also receive this shirt in your package! The blue Digital Champions shirt features MZ and Alpha from Twill Distilled's amazing poster work in black, white, and red! This perk will be unlocked at $1100!




Stretch Goal #3 - $??? - To Be Announced
What is our third stretch goal and when does it unlock? That will be announced close to the second stretch goal, but it's a doozy!




Who We Are Hello everyone! Alpha Riff here! I'm an Indie Hip-Hop/Nerdcore Artist who loves telling great stories via incredible music. I'm on IndieGoGo again to tell you guys about my brand new full-length album, Digital Champions: Migdal Bavel.
Digital Champions: Migdal Bavel is a 23 track Hip-Hopera about two digital bounty hunters, Alpha Riff and MZ,  and their quest to figure out why a strain of lethal C.O.D.E. is ravaging their world. Through the tale, they meet an array of incredible characters played by amazing emcees and singers. Some become allies, others enemies, but all will leave you breathless with their energetic and emotive deliveries.
This time around, we are looking to take the story beyond the album. We want to create trading cards, games, and more. With your help, we can achieve all of that!


What We Need & What You Get To achieve this, we are looking to raise $600. While Digital Champions: Migdal Bavel has already been completed and we are ramping up for the marketing push, we still need help with the physical side. With your help, we can make it come to fruition much faster.

There are several levels of donation, from $2.50 to $100, but each one gets you their respective perks at cheaper than retail price. It also helps lock down future parts of the project, such as the mobile game that is in prototyping stages and music videos to coincide with the album.
Everyone who donates receives ringtones and text tones from the album, including the various instrumental themes. All of those who donate enough to get the album will get a free week of streaming before the album is released! *NEW* You will also get my other full length album, From Beta to Alpha Riff, AND VI: Final Fantasy VI Tribute, a 3 track instrumental album releasing on October 20, 2014 for free! As for what you get at each level:
- $2.50 (+$4.50 Shipping) funding: All 20 of the character trading cards, which allow 15% off Alpha Riff merchandise + codes allowing free in-app purchases in the Digital Champions mobile game coming in 2015 - Card art courtesy of Thor Angelus (https://www.facebook.com/mjolnirincpins)

Example trading card - Design not final


- $5.00 funding: The Digital Champions: Migdal Bavel digital album at discount
Album Cover and Back

- $7.00 (+ $5.00 Shipping) funding: Digital Champions: Migdal Bavel digital album at discount + all 20 trading cards
- $10.00 (+ $5.00 Shipping) funding: Physical copy of Digital Champions: Migdal Bavel + everything above
- $25.00 (+ $5.00 Shipping) funding: Brand new red Digital Champions: Migdal Bavel T-shirt + everything above
Shirt Design:




- $50.00 (+ $5.00 Shipping) funding: Beta invites to Digital Champions: Migdal Bavel mobile games + everything above
- $100.00 (+ $5.00 Shipping) funding: Associate Producer for Digital Champions: Migdal Bavel + Future song shoutout + YOUR OWN DIGITAL CHAMPIONS CHARACTER ( in an album, game, videos, Etc) + Voice-over acting for said character + everything above
If we are unable to meet our goal, we will still have physical merchandise! It will take longer to become available, however, so we hope you can help us get it out much faster!


VI: Final Fantasy Tribute Instrumental Album Perk!

As a huge thank you to everyone, I am including a new perk for those who donate. Anyone who has a base donation contribution of $5 or more (all perks except 20 Trading Cards ONLY perk) will ALSO receive the brand new Alpha Riff album, VI: Final Fantasy VI Tribute, for FREE. Slated to release on October 20, 2014 for the 20th Anniversary of the US release of Final Fantasy VI (III US), VI: Final Fantasy VI Tribute is a 3 track instrumental album dedicated to 3 of my favorite characters of all time: Locke, Cyan, and Shadow. It will be priced at $3 at release! I can't wait to get this one into your hands! It's been a fun project I've been working on alongside Digital Champions: Migdal Bavel and I think you will really enjoy putting it into rotation! Download links will be sent out on October 20th for all those who donate!





BRAND NEW PERK!
What's better than getting one amazing Alpha Riff album plus a 3 track instrumental? How about getting ANOTHER Alpha Riff album completely free? As a huge thank you for all of this support, anyone who has a base contribution of $5 or more will get my previous full-length album, From Beta to Alpha Riff, for FREE today! This perk is retroactive, so check your email if you've already donated (check your email shortly). You will receive a code for the album in your email (this email is not published or shared with anyone and will only be used to deliver the codes for any digital goods; you will not be placed on a mailing list from this IndieGoGo).




The Cast & The World Digital Champions: Migdal Bavel is set in the world of Digitalia, a computer based world where the Flux, humanoid-like beings, live their day to day lives. Within Digitalia are hundreds of continents and it is on the continent known only as The Zone where our story takes place. The Zone is divided into two areas: the DMZ and the Fire Wall. The DMZ is a wasteland where it is said no one can return. The Fire Wall is a tall barrier encircling an enormous area at the edge of The Zone. Within the Fire Wall is the city of I.P. It is inside of I.P. that Alpha Riff and MZ live.
I.P. is not the only city within the Fire Wall, but it the largest and most important. I.P. is home to billions of Flux, who go about their lives working, eating, sleeping, living, laughing, and loving just as humans do. They are ruled by a parliament, they have a military, and there is a seedy underground network of bounty hunters, mercenary, drug and arms dealers, and more doing the dirty work of corrupting politicians and assassinating their enemies.
It is in I.P. that we meet most of the characters in the story:
B. B. Stuart - Played by TekForce (https://soundcloud.com/tek45), B. B. Stuart is the go-to for those looking for information on anything in I.P. Owner of the Hypertext Cafe, a club known for the hottest women, the best drinks, and the loudest music in all of I.P, B. B. Stuart is Alpha and MZ's go-to whenever they're in a jam.
Asim Billy - Played by Ish1da (https://soundcloud.com/ish1da), Asim Billy is one of the most prominent arms dealers in all of I.P. If you need a weapon that can take out a tank, Asim Billy is your man.
Principal T. C. - Played by 1UP (https://soundcloud.com/creativemindframe), Principal T. C. is the power hungry military General who heads up Protocol Academy and the military. Alpha has a very sorted history with the man. 
Klass - Played by TV's Tyler Boyco (https://soundcloud.com/tvstylerboyco), Klass is Alpha's old mentor in all things bounty hunting. Now retired, Alpha and MZ seek his advice during their quest.
Captain Proxy - Played by 2 Mello of Chrono Jigga and Nastlevania fame (https://soundcloud.com/2mello), Captain Proxy is the crotchety old man guarding the Gates of Fire Wall, not allowing anyone to leave or enter.
But that is not all! They meet many others throughout their journeys, both good, evil, and neutral. These are played by the following:
Mysterious Caller - Played by Tyefighter. Sends Alpha on his initial quest.
Keyware - Played by MC Ohm-I (https://soundcloud.com/mc-ohm-i). Just one of the many bounties they have to collect.
Fate - Played by Zilla Persona (http://zillapersona.com/). A broken program floating through the world.
Creeper - Played by Ekaj (https://soundcloud.com/ekaj-daverbal-miraje). One of Anti's most loyal henchmen.
Death - Played by Matt Mead of Kingdoms Burn (https://www.facebook.com/KingdomsBurn). A sub-routine written into Creeper's code.
Destiny - Played by 2-Ton 21 (https://www.facebook.com/2ton21). A broken program floating through the world.
Crimelord B. Net - Played by Nyte (https://nyte.bandcamp.com/). One of the most notorious of crimelords in I.P.
Harbinger - Played by Jollimus (https://soundcloud.com/jollimus). An experiment gone wrong. It now wanders the DMZ looking for prey to quiz with riddles from its 7 faces.
Christian Proxy - Played by Midi-Boss of The Last Wordbenders (https://soundcloud.com/thelastwordbenders). Lost explorer.
Ravager - Played by Kordlyss (https://soundcloud.com/kordlyss). Unabashed serial killer.
Denial the Servicer - Played by ForneusMod of Hanna Barbaric (https://soundcloud.com/hanna-barbaric). Excommunicated military General with a chip on his shoulder.
Forgiveness - Played by Susan Davis. A sub-routine built into MZ's programming.
Anti - Played by Phantastik the Phenom (https://soundcloud.com/phantastikthephenom). Alpha's very first bounty.
Prog - Played by Aramis (https://soundcloud.com/aramis616). Does he truly exist?


  Risks & Challenges What risks are there to donating? None! Whether the goals are met, there will be merchandise. But, with your help, we can obtain it much faster! And what do you get for it? More discounts, a hand in future pieces of Digital Champions, and the chance to become a part of the series!

<h3>À l'aube d'un nouveau jour...</h3>
<h3><span style=""line-height: 26px;"">C'est le titre de travail du nouvel album des MALPRIS. Le groupe entre en studio pour l'enregistrement de ce deuxième effort ces jours-ci. Une douzaine de titres constitueront ce cd qui sera entièrement composé des pièces originales.</span></h3>
<div>Ce moment crucial dans la vie des <b>Malpris</b> ne pourra se faire sans le soutien des fans du groupe et de leurs amis. C'est pourquoi nous avons décidé de se tourner vers vous afin de nous aider à relever ce défi si important.</div>
<p>Le premier album, <i>La Bouée</i>, a été entièrement financé par le groupe. Cette fois, les attentes sont plus élevées. Notre musique a pris un chemin inattendu et nous avons la ferme intention d'aller au bout de nos efforts de création et sans vous, il sera très difficile d'y arriver. </p>
<p>Honnêtement, la sécurité financière de vos contributions permettra cette paix d'esprit que nous recherchons. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>La production</h3>
<p>Produire un album de qualité nécessite beaucoup d'efforts mais aussi un environnement propice à la réussite du projet. Malheureusement, tout cela coûte très cher. L'objectif de notre campagne de financement sur Indiegogo est de 4000$. Avec cette somme, nous pourrons défrayer les coûts du studio. </p>
<p>Cela peut paraître énorme pour un projet musical indépendant. Mais sachez que cette somme ne représente qu'une partie de la production. Si l'on tient compte que la réalisation d'un album implique au minimum 200 heures de travail, un calcul tout simple nous indique qu'il nous en coûtera 25$ de l'heure. </p>
<p>Il n'en tient qu'à vous de décider combien d'heures vous avez envie de nous offrir!</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Notre engagement</h3>
<p>Selon le montant que vous aurez envie d'investir dans notre aventure, nous aurons une contrepartie équivalente à vous offrir. Parmi ces «contreparties», vous pourriez recevoir un album autographié, un t-shirt, une invitation à venir en studio, une invitation VIP au lancement et si on trouve que vous êtes vraiment généreux, on vous offrira un petit concert privé en version acoustique dans le confort de votre foyer!</p>
<p>Sachez que tous les sous recueillis dans le cadre de cette campagne iront à la production de l'album. Ne vous inquiétez pas, nous ne prendrons pas l'avion pour Nashville afin de se payer le Studio B de RCA Victor! Toutes les sommes investies le seront dans la région de l'Outaouais. De par votre engagement dans notre projet, vous aiderez du même coup des petits entrepreneurs de Gatineau.</p>

<h3><i>Deadline</i></h3>
<p> Après avoir vécu l'expérience lors de la production du premier album, nous avons décidé de ne pas s'attacher à un échéancier précis, sauf pour ce qui est de cette campagne de financement.</p>
<p>Nous croyons que, cette fois et grâce à vos contributions, nous pourrons travailler plus à notre aise. Mais, vous devez aussi savoir que la réalisation de ce genre de projet amène son lot d'écueils et de difficultés. Par contre, nous nous engageons à vous tenir bien au fait de l'évolution de notre travail.</p>
<p>Concernant cette campagne, nous n'allons pas attendre d'avoir atteint notre objectif de financement (5000$) avant de se mettre au travail. Nous sommes confiants d'atteindre notre objectif mais si ce chiffre n'est pas atteint dans les 40 jours de la campagne, nous redoublerons d'efforts afin de vous offrir un produit de qualité, peu importe les moyens financiers mis à notre disposition.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>D'autres façons d'aider</h3>
<p>Nous savons très bien que certains d'entre-vous ne pourront pas contribuer financièrement à notre projet mais cela ne veut pas dire que vous ne pouvez pas nous aider. Passez le mot dans votre entourage et encouragez les gens à nous aider. Ce sera votre façon de contribuer à notre projet. Et i<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">l y a plusieurs outils de partage sur ce site qui vous aideront à promouvoir nos efforts.</span></p>
<p>Enfin, nous avons mis la barre très haute pour ce deuxième opus et sans vous, nous ne pourrons pas y arriver.</p>
</div></div>","À l'aube d'un nouveau jour...

Nous croyons que, cette fois et grâce à vos contributions, nous pourrons travailler plus à notre aise. Mais, vous devez aussi savoir que la réalisation de ce genre de projet amène son lot d'écueils et de difficultés. Par contre, nous nous engageons à vous tenir bien au fait de l'évolution de notre travail.
Concernant cette campagne, nous n'allons pas attendre d'avoir atteint notre objectif de financement (5000$) avant de se mettre au travail. Nous sommes confiants d'atteindre notre objectif mais si ce chiffre n'est pas atteint dans les 40 jours de la campagne, nous redoublerons d'efforts afin de vous offrir un produit de qualité, peu importe les moyens financiers mis à notre disposition.

D'autres façons d'aider
Nous savons très bien que certains d'entre-vous ne pourront pas contribuer financièrement à notre projet mais cela ne veut pas dire que vous ne pouvez pas nous aider. Passez le mot dans votre entourage et encouragez les gens à nous aider. Ce sera votre façon de contribuer à notre projet. Et il y a plusieurs outils de partage sur ce site qui vous aideront à promouvoir nos efforts.
Enfin, nous avons mis la barre très haute pour ce deuxième opus et sans vous, nous ne pourrons pas y arriver.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

</p><h4><b>Who we are: 
</b></h4>
<p>We're an independent seven piece horn
fueled band based in Ottawa that performs original music in the “jump
blues” style of late swing/early R&amp;B artists like Louis Jordan
or Wynonnie Harris or more modern acts like Big Bad Voodoo Daddy.     Billed as “the missing link between swing &amp;
rock 'n roll”  we deliver a high energy show with an emphasis on
cookin' grooves, fun satirical lyrics and improvised solos from the
many great players in the band.  
</p>
<p>
</p><h4><b>What' we've done and what's going on
now:</b></h4>
<p>Over the years we've toured in Europe
and the United States as well as around central Canada and spring
2015 marks the release of our 5<sup>th</sup> album of music called
<a href=""https://soundcloud.com/search?q=jivewires"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Drive Me Sane”</a>.     With a reformed band of excellent musicians, we've written a great album and
created a fine studio recording.    Good enough (and lucky enough) to have two
songs from “Drive Me Sane” placed in a movie called “Prisoner
Of Time” by local production company Siloam Entertainment which has
now been picked up by Castlerock Entertainment in LA.     We appear in
the movie as a band (I know, it's a bit of a stretch for us)
performing at a club in Seoul during the Korean War in the early
50's.    The song picked for that scene is called  “Fine, Fine, Fine”
and the video Siloam made for us of that song is posted above.     They've since made a second video of “Jazz, Blues &amp;
Dancin' Shoes”, the other song used in “Prisoner Of Time” and
we'll be releasing that in late April 2015.  
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We've booked a date at Centerpointe
Theatre, a great venue in Ottawa to perform a CD release show and
we're busy getting ready to release our new album.    We put all the
money we had into producing “Drive Me Sane” and so right
now the bank account is dry.   The costs we'll be covering with this funding campaign include the extra fees for the technicians at Centerpointe to work with video production but mostly for the cost of digital video recording equipment, camera people and post production of the footage.<br/></p>
<p>
</p><h4><b>Max and the Siloam Team:</b></h4>
<p>Siloam has an excellent
cameraman/production editor named Max Moskal who is a joy to work
with and a very creative talent.    As we've grown comfortable
with Max and Siloam's production crew, we'd love to
have them come in and tape the release show.    Of course this comes
with some costs and so we're launching this Indiegogo campaign to get
that extra funding.    To that end we've decided to do something we've
never done before: produce official Jivewires t-shirts and offer them
as perks specifically for this funding drive.      The t-shirts will
have our logo with the name of the album underneath so it will read
“The Jivewires Drive Me Sane”.    <a href=""http://www.thejivewires.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Jives-black-tshirt.jpg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Here's </a>a link you can click to
see a mock up of the shirt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We hope you'll be interested in being a
part of our project and contribute whatever you'd like to help us
produce a great professional taping our release show.   Everyone who
contributes $5 or more will be listed as a ""Generous Supporter ""in the credits
of the final concert video or any videos made from the concert footage.  <br/></p><p>
</p><p>Thanks so much for your time and
consideration,

This is somewhat of a major blow for us. After taking what was certainly one of the saddest inventories we’ve ever taken, the total cost came out to over <strong>$15,000</strong>. Basically that means that Boyd’s drums are gone, Roger’s bass and amp, all of our pedals, mics, cords, sound system, and even our merchandise. I’m sure they will get some solid use out of our 80 shirts. As a band, I am proud that we have made it to a point where each member can live off of doing what we love. However, it doesn’t leave much for the savings account, and our gear was our biggest and most important investment. We are in a bit of a bind. We are reaching out to you for any help you can give. Many of you have supported us in countless different ways, and we couldn’t be more grateful. It is very hard for us to ask for something like this, but we are overwhelmed. Once again, anything helps. We are happy with any amount; we would be ecstatic to reach our goal of <strong>1/3</strong> of the cost, <strong>$5000</strong>, and amazed to receive even more toward the total cost.

Basically that means that Boyd’s drums are gone, Roger’s bass and amp, all of our pedals, mics, cords, sound system, and even our merchandise. I’m sure they will get some solid use out of our 80 shirts. As a band, I am proud that we have made it to a point where each member can live off of doing what we love. However, it doesn’t leave much for the savings account, and our gear was our biggest and most important investment. We are in a bit of a bind. We are reaching out to you for any help you can give. Many of you have supported us in countless different ways, and we couldn’t be more grateful. It is very hard for us to ask for something like this, but we are overwhelmed. Once again, anything helps. We are happy with any amount; we would be ecstatic to reach our goal of 1/3 of the cost, $5000, and amazed to receive even more toward the total cost. But we know this is life and these things happen. Thank you for your continued support, we love you all.-DCSA",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>The Gemini Project</h3>
<p>Heya! Fáilte, Halito, and Osiyo!  My name is KeL and I am the lead singer for the group, The Gemini Project.  I also have the privilege of co-producing The Gemini Project’s first full length studio album, Ceallach, wherein I get to play piano, guitar, bodhran, Native American hand drum, harmonica, and accordion on many of our tracks…because, you know, the other guys agreed to just let me. ;)  I’m of Irish, Choctaw, and Cherokee descent (in that order) and a little bit of Muscogee (Creek.)  Most of my singing has been in gospel choirs in church but I do the occasional live performance in an Irish pub or a cantina here and there.  No matter the venue, I always like to try expressing many facets of my cultural heritage in my singing and vocal styles.  I hope that you will enjoy hearing some of them on our new album, Ceallach, which will be released this summer.  :)</p>
<p>The Gemini Project officially began in 2006 with just two members, Jim and I (get it, Jim and I…Gemini?  haha!)  Now we are a group of six frightfully ego-less musicians committed to playing our kind of music for the benefit of the greater good.  We are very realistic about ourselves and what we hope to achieve; none of us are looking to get rich or make it big, we just love making music!  Jim, our other album co-producer and lead guitarist, has been writing and playing music for guitar for over twenty-five years and likewise for Native American flute for six years.  Jim donates most of his Native American flute cd’s to ONESpirit (nativeprogress.org) the proceeds of which are given to the Lakota of Pine Ridge Rez.  Jim and I were already considering making a Celtic album for quite some time.  Then, when I was visiting home, I got the call from my cousin Nicholas about our friend Rusty.  At that moment, I knew we had to make this album and why.</p>
<p>Not too long ago, my friend Rusty Dunagan, who is also a very close friend of my family, was grievously wounded in an IED explosion in Afghanistan losing his left arm and both legs.  Shortly thereafter, he became one of twenty-three American triple amputees from the war in Afghanistan.  Rusty was always this gritty, hard-working kid with a heart of gold—owing in part I suppose to his blue collar Irish-American roots. Rusty is a very courageous soldier, but more than that, he’s a REAL family man.  He and his lovely wife Angie have four children.  Having had the privilege to get to know Angie a lot over the last few months, I can say that without doubt, she is the sweetest girl in the world.  I absolutely love the Dunagan family and only want the very best for them, especially considering all the sacrifices they have had to make, for me, and for all of us. </p>
<p>As a Veteran, I’m not blind to the current situation of the VA.  Though they have a lot of great folks working for them, they are over task-saturated and dismally under-funded.  Although Rusty is still a Sergeant on active duty in the Army until the completion of his medical boards, I fear that soon, he will join the staggering ranks of those not receiving the appropriate medical attention they need from the VA.  They do what they can, but let’s be very honest about this situation…it’s highly unlikely that the Army or the VA will ever be able to meet the Dunagan family’s needs.  So, we, The Gemini Project, have recorded our first full-length album (16 tracks in all!) with the intent that if we could raise enough money to be able to print the cd’s, we would sell them and donate ALL the proceeds to the Dunagan family.  That is precisely what we need your help to accomplish.  We need to raise $4,500 to meet album production costs for art, layout, design, photography and especially the cost to actually print the cd’s.  Please keep reading to find out how you can help us and become a part of The Gemini Project and this valuable cause.</p>
<p>Yakoke,</p>
<p>~KeL</p>

<div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The Gemini Project would be delighted to receive donations of any amount!  However, for every $25 donation you make, we will send you an autographed cd of our album, Ceallach, once it is released.</p>
<p>So what’s in it for you to donate to The Gemini Project cause?  Well, in addition to showing your support for our wounded Warriors, you'll also essentially be placing on reserve (or pre-ordering, if you will) a copy of our album BEFORE our release date.  Since quantities will be limited, this assures you will get a copy of ""Ceallach"" before they are gone.  But more important than anything else, you get to walk away feeling good about your purchase/donation knowing that all your money is going to an excellent cause.  When you think about it, a cd purchased in a music store will set you back $17.99…say you go in, blow out a twenty, then what do you do with the remaining two dollars?  Add five more, skip the cd store altogether, and donate to The Gemini Project! :) Not only will you get over an hour’s worth of some great, historically-rich music, (you can hear a couple of our tracks playing in the background in our video) but like the six of us musicians, you too will become part of The Gemini Project.  Nothing brings more soul satisfaction than giving of yourself to your community and thereby becoming a part of something bigger than yourself.  In essence, The Gemini project is just a really neat opportunity for all of us to be able to do that and to give something back.  It’s that pay-it-forward attitude…and it WILL all come back to you, believe me.</p>
<p>So let’s talk numbers:  Ah money, money…I hate money.  I think I speak for all our musicians when I say we have the heart for art’s sake, but no stomach for the business.  So, wouldn’t it be wonderful now if we could “pre-sell” all of our cd’s through your donations?  This is our hope, at any rate; it would mean a lot more funds for the Dunagan family and much less marketing headache for us.</p>
<p>We plan to print 1,000 cd’s.  We would like to keep only 15 of these, a free copy for all persons directly affiliated with album production and 1 for the Dunagans.  If we are able to “pre-sell” the remaining 985 (Lord willing) on this site through your donations, that’s $24,625.  If we meet our goal, IndieGoGo gets a 4% cut off the top and paypal takes 7% when the funds are distrubeted.  For a total of 11% reduction in fees, we now have $21,916.25. </p>
<p>But to be able to print and distribute those cd’s in the first place, there are some upfront costs for album production.  We need to be able to pay our graphic artist designing our album cover and cd panels at least $500 because it’s just downright insulting if we don’t.  Photography will set us back another $450, and the cost to actually print the cd’s is $2,525 before tax.  In addition to this, my friend Rob Rebeck, chief engineer of Chapman Recording Studios, graciously volunteered to produce two tracks for us pro bono!  To show my appreciation, I’d like to be able to tip him $900 because that’s what he would ordinarily make for his services.  He’s a great guy, a brilliant musician, and has a family to support.  I really don’t want to take advantage of his kindness.  So, with all that being said, we are at $4,375 for album production costs.  We are using $4,500 as an estimate for album production costs in case there are unforeseen incidentals (like if the photographer commits highway robbery on us or something) and anything we don’t use directly for album production will be handed over to the Dunagan family along with the proceeds.  It bears repeating: NO GEMINI PROJECT MUSICIAN IS MAKING A DIME OFF THIS ALBUM.  And to be perfectly honest with you, we wouldn’t have it any other way.  :)</p>
<p>So before, I quoted the figure of $21,916.25.  Subtract $4,500 for album production costs (discussed above) and we now have $17,416.25.  Since all of you radiate awesomeness and our album sold out, we now have to ship those cd’s to you.  We estimate the cost of shipping to be $2 per unit.  Multiply that by 985 (for the number of cd’s sold) and shipping costs will set us back another $1,970.  <strong>Now for the part you’ve all been waiting for, if you help us pre-sell all 985 of our cd’s using this site with your $25 donations, $15,446.25 is what we would raise for the Dunagan family!</strong>  If you find yourself in a position to be able to make a donation, it would mean so much to all of us.</p>

</div></div>","The Gemini Project
Heya! Fáilte, Halito, and Osiyo!  My name is KeL and I am the lead singer for the group, The Gemini Project.  I also have the privilege of co-producing The Gemini Project’s first full length studio album, Ceallach, wherein I get to play piano, guitar, bodhran, Native American hand drum, harmonica, and accordion on many of our tracks…because, you know, the other guys agreed to just let me. ;)  I’m of Irish, Choctaw, and Cherokee descent (in that order) and a little bit of Muscogee (Creek.)  Most of my singing has been in gospel choirs in church but I do the occasional live performance in an Irish pub or a cantina here and there.  No matter the venue, I always like to try expressing many facets of my cultural heritage in my singing and vocal styles.  I hope that you will enjoy hearing some of them on our new album, Ceallach, which will be released this summer.  :)
The Gemini Project officially began in 2006 with just two members, Jim and I (get it, Jim and I…Gemini?  haha!)  Now we are a group of six frightfully ego-less musicians committed to playing our kind of music for the benefit of the greater good.  We are very realistic about ourselves and what we hope to achieve; none of us are looking to get rich or make it big, we just love making music!  Jim, our other album co-producer and lead guitarist, has been writing and playing music for guitar for over twenty-five years and likewise for Native American flute for six years.  Jim donates most of his Native American flute cd’s to ONESpirit (nativeprogress.org) the proceeds of which are given to the Lakota of Pine Ridge Rez.  Jim and I were already considering making a Celtic album for quite some time.  Then, when I was visiting home, I got the call from my cousin Nicholas about our friend Rusty.  At that moment, I knew we had to make this album and why.
Not too long ago, my friend Rusty Dunagan, who is also a very close friend of my family, was grievously wounded in an IED explosion in Afghanistan losing his left arm and both legs.  Shortly thereafter, he became one of twenty-three American triple amputees from the war in Afghanistan.  Rusty was always this gritty, hard-working kid with a heart of gold—owing in part I suppose to his blue collar Irish-American roots. Rusty is a very courageous soldier, but more than that, he’s a REAL family man.  He and his lovely wife Angie have four children.  Having had the privilege to get to know Angie a lot over the last few months, I can say that without doubt, she is the sweetest girl in the world.  I absolutely love the Dunagan family and only want the very best for them, especially considering all the sacrifices they have had to make, for me, and for all of us. 
As a Veteran, I’m not blind to the current situation of the VA.  Though they have a lot of great folks working for them, they are over task-saturated and dismally under-funded.  Although Rusty is still a Sergeant on active duty in the Army until the completion of his medical boards, I fear that soon, he will join the staggering ranks of those not receiving the appropriate medical attention they need from the VA.  They do what they can, but let’s be very honest about this situation…it’s highly unlikely that the Army or the VA will ever be able to meet the Dunagan family’s needs.  So, we, The Gemini Project, have recorded our first full-length album (16 tracks in all!) with the intent that if we could raise enough money to be able to print the cd’s, we would sell them and donate ALL the proceeds to the Dunagan family.  That is precisely what we need your help to accomplish.  We need to raise $4,500 to meet album production costs for art, layout, design, photography and especially the cost to actually print the cd’s.  Please keep reading to find out how you can help us and become a part of The Gemini Project and this valuable cause.
Yakoke,

What We Need & What You Get
The Gemini Project would be delighted to receive donations of any amount!  However, for every $25 donation you make, we will send you an autographed cd of our album, Ceallach, once it is released.
So what’s in it for you to donate to The Gemini Project cause?  Well, in addition to showing your support for our wounded Warriors, you'll also essentially be placing on reserve (or pre-ordering, if you will) a copy of our album BEFORE our release date.  Since quantities will be limited, this assures you will get a copy of ""Ceallach"" before they are gone.  But more important than anything else, you get to walk away feeling good about your purchase/donation knowing that all your money is going to an excellent cause.  When you think about it, a cd purchased in a music store will set you back $17.99…say you go in, blow out a twenty, then what do you do with the remaining two dollars?  Add five more, skip the cd store altogether, and donate to The Gemini Project! :) Not only will you get over an hour’s worth of some great, historically-rich music, (you can hear a couple of our tracks playing in the background in our video) but like the six of us musicians, you too will become part of The Gemini Project.  Nothing brings more soul satisfaction than giving of yourself to your community and thereby becoming a part of something bigger than yourself.  In essence, The Gemini project is just a really neat opportunity for all of us to be able to do that and to give something back.  It’s that pay-it-forward attitude…and it WILL all come back to you, believe me.
So let’s talk numbers:  Ah money, money…I hate money.  I think I speak for all our musicians when I say we have the heart for art’s sake, but no stomach for the business.  So, wouldn’t it be wonderful now if we could “pre-sell” all of our cd’s through your donations?  This is our hope, at any rate; it would mean a lot more funds for the Dunagan family and much less marketing headache for us.
We plan to print 1,000 cd’s.  We would like to keep only 15 of these, a free copy for all persons directly affiliated with album production and 1 for the Dunagans.  If we are able to “pre-sell” the remaining 985 (Lord willing) on this site through your donations, that’s $24,625.  If we meet our goal, IndieGoGo gets a 4% cut off the top and paypal takes 7% when the funds are distrubeted.  For a total of 11% reduction in fees, we now have $21,916.25. 
But to be able to print and distribute those cd’s in the first place, there are some upfront costs for album production.  We need to be able to pay our graphic artist designing our album cover and cd panels at least $500 because it’s just downright insulting if we don’t.  Photography will set us back another $450, and the cost to actually print the cd’s is $2,525 before tax.  In addition to this, my friend Rob Rebeck, chief engineer of Chapman Recording Studios, graciously volunteered to produce two tracks for us pro bono!  To show my appreciation, I’d like to be able to tip him $900 because that’s what he would ordinarily make for his services.  He’s a great guy, a brilliant musician, and has a family to support.  I really don’t want to take advantage of his kindness.  So, with all that being said, we are at $4,375 for album production costs.  We are using $4,500 as an estimate for album production costs in case there are unforeseen incidentals (like if the photographer commits highway robbery on us or something) and anything we don’t use directly for album production will be handed over to the Dunagan family along with the proceeds.  It bears repeating: NO GEMINI PROJECT MUSICIAN IS MAKING A DIME OFF THIS ALBUM.  And to be perfectly honest with you, we wouldn’t have it any other way.  :)
So before, I quoted the figure of $21,916.25.  Subtract $4,500 for album production costs (discussed above) and we now have $17,416.25.  Since all of you radiate awesomeness and our album sold out, we now have to ship those cd’s to you.  We estimate the cost of shipping to be $2 per unit.  Multiply that by 985 (for the number of cd’s sold) and shipping costs will set us back another $1,970.  Now for the part you’ve all been waiting for, if you help us pre-sell all 985 of our cd’s using this site with your $25 donations, $15,446.25 is what we would raise for the Dunagan family!  If you find yourself in a position to be able to make a donation, it would mean so much to all of us.

<p><span>My name is Sophie Spreier, and I’m a cellist studying music performance. I have high hopes to become a professional collaborative musician on the stage and in the film industry, and I need your help.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>Here is my story:</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>I’ve been playing the cello for most of my life. I started when I was three years old, studying the Suzuki Method with Carol Tarr in Denver, Colorado. My family moved to Pocatello, Idaho four years after and my single-parent mother commuted with me to Salt Lake City every week for lessons with Carey Cheney, a renowned Suzuki teacher, for the next 11 years. All the while, my mother raised her eight other children, survived breast cancer, endured a house fire, and established an independent Montessori school. She made sure that I was able to progress with my music, no matter what. Through the help of  her, my family, my dear mentors, and extraordinary circumstances, I’ve had the privilege of playing for legends including Arnold Steinhardt, Lawrence Lesser, and Yo-Yo Ma.</span></p>
<p><span>By the time I graduated high school, I knew I wanted to pursue an education and career in music. I auditioned for music programs at multiple colleges, and I was able to receive a full tuition scholarship from Utah State University in Logan, Utah. At the time, I was playing on my student cello that had survived our family’s house fire, but it was terribly smoke-damaged. I was playing at a level that surpassed my instrument, and I would eventually have to find a professional cello-- soon, if I wanted to progress.</span></p>
<p><span>The week before I was supposed to leave for school, my family and I were surprised with a visit from Ty Pennington and an “Extreme Makeover” of our burned-down home. Through the whirlwind of events and the inconceivable generosity of our community, my family and I were given the means to start our lives anew. I was also given a professional cello made by Chris Dungey-- something I’d dreamt about for years. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>Finding a bow:</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>Now that I have a high-quality cello, I’ve had to find a comparable bow because when it comes to stringed instruments, the bow is just as important as the instrument itself. I’ve been playing with my old student bow on a new Dungey cello, and the combination has actually been stunting the sound of my cello and my own technical development. Obviously I want to continue progressing, so I’ve been looking for bows comparable to my instrument. The process has been long and grueling because every bow is unique, and the match is different with every instrument. Weight, width, cut, density, country of origin, maker, year, and quality of materials are all factors that add into that distinction, then the instrument and playing style of the musician determine the match. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>Buying a bow:</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>After a year of investigating copious numbers of bows from multiple makers, I’ve finally found the perfect match for my beautiful cello. It’s an F. A. Nurnberger out of Germany in 1935 valued at $5000. I cannot find words enough to express how much relief this bow has given to my playing. I can finally reach that deep, rich tone my cello has been longing to produce, and I’ve improved immensely in my playing just after a few short months. </span></p>
<p><span>Buying this bow is essentially the next step to my progression in a musical career. I’ve already taken out a student loan for the bow, but it will only cover half of the amount. I need to raise the other half in a very short amount of time. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>Study Abroad:</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>I’m in the third year of attaining my undergraduate degree, and I’ve been recruited to attend a 4-week study abroad program in England. It’s an opportunity that I feel could be crucial to my progressing as a musician. The program will cover music history and art courses crucial to my education as a musician and credited toward my degree. Not to mention, there will be opportunities to attend world-class concerts and museums across the breadth and width of England. I’ll also have the unique opportunity to take private lessons at conservatories including The Royal Academy of Music and Trinity Laban Conservatoire, as well as do a more in-depth study of Edward Elgar’s cello concerto in E Minor. </span></p>
<p><span>I’ve been studying Elgar’s cello concerto over the past year, and I’ve fallen in-love with both the poignantly painful music and the era Elgar was living in at the time. I have a goal to perform an in-depth of study of this masterpiece while in England, and record it upon my return as part of a debut album in August 2013. </span></p>
<p><span>Scholarships are available for the study abroad trip, but they are highly uncertain and could only cover up to $1000. The program plus airfare and basic needs will cost an estimated $5000; $6000 if I bring my cello with me and take additional private lessons.</span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><strong>Here is how you can help:</strong></p>
<p><span>I have been working hard to save my own money to support these goals, but because I am a full-time student and musician, I'm not able to raise all the money myself. If you would like to contribute, any support (monetary or otherwise) is highly appreciated!</span></p>
