<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Thandi's Trippy Trips is a book about a South African girl who travels to different cities in the world. Each book has a consistent formula: (1) Thandi's curiosity is triggered, (2) She explores a city (3) She meets a new imaginary friend in each place, (4) At the end of her trip, she collects a souvenir and places it on her 'shelf of souvenirs'. Every book ends with the questions: ""Where will Thandi go next?""</p>
<p>So far, there are three illustrated books, their equivalent coloring story books and a new book in progress: ""Silicon Valley"" special edition book, where Thandi explores tech.</p>
<ul>
<li>I am an illustrator, visual designer, writer, self-publisher and business woman.</li>
<li>This campaign is purposed to reach the goal of being able to distribute these collectible books to children around the world - rich and poor. </li>
<li>Contributors will help me to achieve a minimum amount of stock to keep per book released. At the moment, I do on-demand orders - which works out to be far more expensive to print.</li>
<li>These funds will hep me to afford maintaining the e-commerce website and printing (R7500), packaging (R600), shipping costs (R1200), product development (Toy Design &amp; prototyping) and get some creative assistance (R10000) to expedite production. </li>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The world's great literature, right in your pocket. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Time's Arrow is a multimedia reading platform that brings the printed word to life for students of all ages, backgrounds, and learning styles. Designed as an exploratory landscape, Time’s Arrow allows students to move through literary history with the ease and pleasure of a stroll through a beautiful countryside. On this landscape, students will discover great works of storytelling from every walk of life, reflecting an updated and expanding view of the traditional literary canon. These works are presented alongside audio performances and animations of the texts, drawing students into the aesthetic and intellectual pleasures that a lifetime of deep reading affords. While this mode of literary presentation serves to properly welcome students into a world of reading, our value of multidimensional representation helps ensure students will discover something of themselves in what they find.</p> <p>Currently, Time's Arrow is in the late stages of product development and testing with a goal to go live with a full literary and media library by this fall. We have begun collaborating with an ever-expanding network of educators, actors, artists, learning specialists, and musicians to that end, producing a diverse, dynamic, and integrated literature curriculum for students of all levels and backgrounds. We are actively seeking feedback, potential partnerships, and introductions to schools, educators, and leaders in edtech to help bring our vision to fruition.</p>
<p>At Time's Arrow, we have created a platform for oral and written storytelling that puts great works from the world over into context for students, presenting, performing, animating, and explaining the world's most enduring myths, poetry, novels, plays, and historical writing. We bring actors, educators, and artists together into one place with one purpose: to create best possible invitation to world literature. We believe the delivery mechanism for knowledge matters as much as the content. </p>
<p>Whether you are a high school student reading your first great novel, or a weekend warrior making time for a beloved poem, Time’s Arrow let's you explore the best of world literature on a gorgeous, interactive, ""natural landscape"" style ecosystem. We are in the final stages of turning our prototype into a functional product, and are looking for a boost to get us across the finish line. </p>

<p>My name is Wayne Crittenden. That's me in the picture above; with one of the teams that I had the privilege of coaching. Over the last 15 years, athletes have come and gone; but the system hasn't changed. There has been a ceiling on success in my community. After considering that this could be a problem in other places, I developed a plan for a network that could improve sports on all levels. Then I created a brand to support the network and all its participants. </p>
<h3>Finito Brand</h3>
<p>There are countless brands in the apparel industry; but most do not have a clear meaning or a defined purpose. Two unique things about the Finito brand are its name and intent.</p>
<p><b>Finito</b> is derived from the Latin word <i><b>finire</b></i>; meaning <b>to finish</b>. The name was chosen to encourage people to persevere. The brand motto is <b>Winners Finish</b>. Coming in 1st place isn't the only way to win, but quitting is a definite way to lose. </p>
<p>The initial goal of the Finito was to become the largest sponsor of academic institutions and athletic programs in the United States. Upon further observation, it was realized that this brand can aid nonprofit organizations as well.</p>
<p>The Finito brand is currently being sold, exclusively, via the <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/FurstImpressio1/app_410312912374011"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Furst Impressions</a> store on Facebook, but large retailers are being sought to distribute a standard line.</p>
<p>​Finito is new; so it isn’t well known or profitable yet. The fastest way to grow the brand is to partner with as many communities as possible. Obtaining subscribers is probably the easiest way to spread the word and ensure success.</p>
<p><b>Subscriptions</b></p>
<p>Subscribers of the Finito brand will receive: 1) discounts on Finito merchandise, 2) priority access to the most current information regarding Finito and the FINAO Acaletic Network (FAN), 3) special invitations to the FAN webinars, meetings, and events, 4) access to the FAN weekly blog and radio program, and 5) valuable tips to help improve their community. Funding will be given to a sponsored school, team, or nonprofit organization on the behalf of each subscriber.</p>
<p>​JILAM FINAO will give $20, to a sponsored team, school, or organization, for every $10 raised in subscriptions. Subscribers will determine who the JFC will sponsor.</p>

</div></div>","My name is Wayne Crittenden. That's me in the picture above; with one of the teams that I had the privilege of coaching. Over the last 15 years, athletes have come and gone; but the system hasn't changed. There has been a ceiling on success in my community. After considering that this could be a problem in other places, I developed a plan for a network that could improve sports on all levels. Then I created a brand to support the network and all its participants. 
Finito Brand
There are countless brands in the apparel industry; but most do not have a clear meaning or a defined purpose. Two unique things about the Finito brand are its name and intent.
Finito is derived from the Latin word finire; meaning to finish. The name was chosen to encourage people to persevere. The brand motto is Winners Finish. Coming in 1st place isn't the only way to win, but quitting is a definite way to lose. 
The initial goal of the Finito was to become the largest sponsor of academic institutions and athletic programs in the United States. Upon further observation, it was realized that this brand can aid nonprofit organizations as well.
The Finito brand is currently being sold, exclusively, via the Furst Impressions store on Facebook, but large retailers are being sought to distribute a standard line.
​Finito is new; so it isn’t well known or profitable yet. The fastest way to grow the brand is to partner with as many communities as possible. Obtaining subscribers is probably the easiest way to spread the word and ensure success.
Subscriptions
Subscribers of the Finito brand will receive: 1) discounts on Finito merchandise, 2) priority access to the most current information regarding Finito and the FINAO Acaletic Network (FAN), 3) special invitations to the FAN webinars, meetings, and events, 4) access to the FAN weekly blog and radio program, and 5) valuable tips to help improve their community. Funding will be given to a sponsored school, team, or nonprofit organization on the behalf of each subscriber.
​JILAM FINAO will give $20, to a sponsored team, school, or organization, for every $10 raised in subscriptions. Subscribers will determine who the JFC will sponsor.
FINAO Acaletic Network (FAN)

The FINAO Acaletic Network was developed for two reasons. First of all, it will be used to connect scholars, players, schools, teams, and communities nationwide. More importantly, it will help students and players to reach their full potential.
This one of ten projects that are a part of the Younite States of America initiative; a true stimulus for the United States economy. 
The idea to develop a system (FAN) that can improve conditions within educational institutions
and enhance the sports experience for players, coaches, and fans came from R.S. ""Wayne"" Crittenden. He is a former athlete, coach of youth sports, graphic designer, and the CEO of the JILAM FINAO Corporation. Mr. Crittenden also
created the Finito acaletic (academic/athletic) brand to support the network.

reverse the effects of the ongoing global recession.
This has never been attempted before, but it will work

word at their comfort level AND receive/process feed back on book to create 2nd
edition based on teacher responses (website development, professional help, and

I expect a lot of feedback and comments which I plan to put into the 2nd
addition, making it more robust. The communication system I plan to setup will
facilitate communication to gather and publish teacher stories of
success/failure, joy/frustrations, hopes/disenchantments, and whatever other
themes that arise for teachers throughout the country. The voices of the
teacher need to be more prevalent, shared, and integrated into conversations
for improving public education in America. I have setup three accounts to me
help spread the word. I want to hear your thoughts and ideas through these

word at their comfort level AND receive/process feed back on book to create 2nd
edition based on teacher responses (website development, professional help, and
maintenance, $4000)
Phase
3 – Use dialogue and stories generated for this book to start second book,
""Teacher Stories: Stories of success, failures, passion, disenchantment,
frustration, excitement, and more.""
My
single purpose is to be a voice for teachers. 
Be
a part of this campaign. It is more than just the book. Once the book is published,
I expect a lot of feedback and comments which I plan to put into the 2nd
addition, making it more robust. The communication system I plan to setup will
facilitate communication to gather and publish teacher stories of
success/failure, joy/frustrations, hopes/disenchantments, and whatever other
themes that arise for teachers throughout the country. The voices of the
teacher need to be more prevalent, shared, and integrated into conversations
for improving public education in America. I have setup three accounts to me
help spread the word. I want to hear your thoughts and ideas through these
media sites:

<p>Founded by Pailin
Pinckes, a native, Thai, citizen from Rayong. Pailin, who moved to America in
2011, taught herself English and learned the American culture with the help of
her husband, Evan Pinckes. The Pinckes family, with their four, beautiful
children, believed in the need and importance of returning to Thailand, to
dedicate their lives to educate the underprivileged and to teach English with
the hopes of bettering their lives. Since 2012 the Pinckes / Chanduaykit
family, and English teacher volunteers have been working out of <a href=""https://www.google.com/maps/@12.80225,101.739551,3a,75y,290.86h,86.25t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1sBscDqq5kIpEkW-dPYHh07A!2e0!6m1!1e1"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span><u>Wat Wutthawas</u></span></a> (The local Temple) on a tight budget to help the local kids
in the area. Our goal is to raise donations to start building freestanding
permanent learning centers with full time teachers.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>Making
a difference</b></p>
<p><strong>
</strong></p>
<p>What distinguishes the
Learning English Center from other English centers and schools, in Thailand, is
we believe in giving back to the community. We will be offering six
different classes, ranging from elementary school through college. Also, we will
have a business class and classes for our senior citizens. The two areas
of study, that we are most proud of, are for the elementary school children and
the seniors, as they are without cost. Ideally, we wish that our entire
English courses could be free at L.E.C. but we need to be able to sustain our
programs to grow and keep our doors, open.</p>
<strong>
</strong><p></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>What We Need &amp; What
You Get</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>The Learning English
Center is a non-profit organization, dedicated to the cause of better English
education, in the Rayong Province. For this purpose, we support and will set up
several small-scale projects, starting in the city of Klaeng, which is a
district (amphoe) in the eastern part of Rayong Province. Through generous
donations, dedication of low cost, native, English teachers, volunteers and
interns, we will offer underprivileged pupils the extra attention and support
they badly need. We will provide our participants with a special and
valuable experience in one of the most beautiful areas, in Thailand. Our Goal
is to open ten English centers, in the next 24 months.</p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>We want to change
Thailand with the power of EDUCATION. Educating the underprivileged, in
English, will give them a much better chance in the world, where the main
language, in business, is English. Our programs are open to anyone aged six and
up. We consider teaching and learning English, as a very strong asset. More
importantly, working well with children, being flexible and teaching the
children responsibility, will improve their lives. Speaking English in today's
world is a valuable tool.</p>
<p><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p>Thailand has a
population of around 67 million people, with the majority well below the
poverty level. The English learning they receive, in school, if any, is so
basic, that they’re deprived from a means of a better life. In a 60-nation
ranking released in 2014, the Education First Institute put Thailand 55th on the
English Proficiency Index. The ranking was based on the results of an
Internet-based English Proficiency test, taken by 750,000 people, from 60
countries. All respondents were of working age. Reports show that people with
greater English proficiency, have higher income. We at L.E.C, want to introduce
English, to students, at a young age, to give them a better chance of
succeeding, in the world.</p>

<div>We are the Charterhouse Exoplanet Project, formed in the later part of 2014.</div>
<div>Our mission is to use the 18"" reflecting telescope (affectionately known as Dudley) to detect transiting exoplanets. This work we intend to bring to the public by hosting outreach events, observing evenings, and research activities for schools. Its very difficult for amateurs &amp; schools to get access to such a large observatory, so we want to help change that.</div>
<div>We hope that, with your help, we can put the Charterhouse observatory on the map as an outreach and research observatory of excellence!<br/>
</div>
<h3>To achieve our goals we need to get a few things</h3>
<div>To make this project really successful there are a number of items of hardware which need some serious attention and even replacement.</div>
<div>1) <b>Drive Motors</b>: These are essential for the operation of the telescope. Without them, it is very difficult to move the scope, and impossible to track objects for a long time. We have made do for quite a number of years now, as one of the motors has not worked very well, making it difficult to find objects in the sky with the remote handset. We have been given a quote of roughly £250 to have them replaced, and will be our first upgrade.</div>
<div>2) <b>Focus Assembly</b>: Our second upgrade would be the focus assembly, this is the mechanism which allows us to pull the images of the night sky, into a crisp sharp image. This really is an essential feature for astronomy. The current focus assembly is very old indeed, and is in need of changing. The new assembly will give us the much needed extra travel, to be able to use our CCD camera for the detection of exoplanets, and to better enable the public to use the scope (the current assembly doesn't give much fine tuning ability) This equipment we anticipate costing around £250-£350</div>
<div>3)<b>Auto-Guider</b>: This is something which we have made do without until now, as the dodgy motor drive makes it somewhat redundant, but once the motors are fixed, then this will be a great feature. Auto-guiding uses another smaller telescope fixed to the main 18"" and another smaller CCD camera. Software monitors how the stars are moving in the small scope, and feeds back to the motor drive to keep the field of view as steady as possible. This makes takes the tracking from good to superb! This will be an essential piece of equipment for very high precision research images, and will allow remote alignment if the telescope was to be set up for remote control. The cost of this is around £300-£400.</div>
<div>4) <b>Focus Assembly Motor</b>: Though not essential for the continued operation of the observatory, this motor drive allows the focus assembly to be controlled from a computer, allowing far more efficient imaging runs, and is one step closer to being able to automate the telescope, which could then become something which schools can ""remote"" into and control from anywhere. This equipment we anticipate to be around £350.</div>
<div>We plan to offer ""thank you gifts"" for donations of different magnitudes, ranging from branded stickers, to a evening at the observatory for you and you friends.</div>
<div>If we don't reach our goal on here, whats next? Initially it will be funded from our own pockets, we will also look toward the Royal Astronomical Society and asking for donations for members of the public attending events and lecture events held at the observatory.</div>
<div>If we manage to meet and surpass our funding goal then the money will go to attaining even more equipment that we will need as the project grows.

</div><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""></span><br/></p><p></p></div>","WHO I AMIt all started in the fall of 1983.  I’m an Israeli-born son of immigrant parents and was raised in LA since the mid 80s.  My childhood was spent playing music, starting at the age of 7.  From piano to trombone,then on to guitar, percussion, and ultimately bass, I had a holistic musical understanding that oscillated between formal lessons and self-taught intuitive explorations.  My folks divorced before my 13th birthday, and in my teens I started exploring more visual realms of self-expression via photography. In 2009 I discovered my obsession with Chinese tea culture and spent the better part of the next 4 years operating as a one-man-tea-business.The past 15 years have been spent as a working musician, freelance visual artist, and entrepreneur.  In 2012, I developed an art/design workflow on my iPhone utilizing 10 brilliant apps that proved intuitive and exciting to use and reuse to explore akin to a graphic designer using adobe creative suite.  In 2013, I debuted my visual art in a group show along with the help of friends who work with creative technologies to present an art installation with corresponding augmented reality that operated as an app on a tablet with the purpose of providing further interaction through audio and visual play.  This art show proved a turning point, and months after discovered the role of the User-Experience Designer in society.
A User-Experience Designer is one who designs the human experience across online and offline platforms: websites, products, services, apps, you name it. When you hear ""user experience design"" think ""designing user experience"". 
These days are proving to be some of the most exciting, as I am about to become a first-time father this summer with my glorious partner Pamela.  In preparation for fatherhood, I am going into a full-time immersive at General Assembly from March - May 2015 with the intent to launch immediately into a new career in UX Design.

MY GOAL
To fund my tuition for the full-time 10-week User a Experience Design Immersive at General Assembly in Santa Monica, Ca.  The current costs amount to $9500.  

WHERE YOU COME IN

<p>This is the first step of a bigger project called Autism Rolo (Nothing about Autism without Autism)</p>

<p>My passion and mission is to get on the road and start a conversation from an autistic perspective highlighting the huge talent pool that is going to waste due to the fear and misunderstanding of our neurodiversity.

<p>Getting out there is the best way forward</p>
<p>I will be able to achieve this by</p>
<p>▪	Giving talks and to other Autism charities whilst assisting in their training which I already do on a voluntary basis</p>
<p>▪	Providing talks seminars, workshops and training in both the public and private sectors</p>
<p>▪	Workshops for smaller groups </p>
<p>▪	Visiting businesses large and small to encourage and promote employment of Autistic workers whilst providing practical solutions (only 15% of those diagnosed are in gainful employment)</p>
<p>▪	Attending Autism Conferences nationally</p>
<p>▪	Setting up flash workshops in public spaces( to my knowledge this has not been done before and I am excited )</p>

</div>","Our StoryThe Juving School lies at the foothills of Mount Everest in Nepal's Sagarmatha National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage site. It is the only school within the district and serves 370 children.


A devastating 7.8 magnitude earthquake ripped through Nepal on April 25th, 2015, followed by several aftershocks, the largest of which was 6.7 in magnitude. The widespread destruction is unimaginable. At The Mountain Fund our focus is now entirely on rebuilding and restoring life and dignity to the people of Nepal.

The Juving School is one of 54 schools completely destroyed by the earthquakes. Currently, it has no infrastructure, no classrooms, and no furniture. It is simply characterized by the 370 children coming here every day, coaxed by teachers and parents, who want to maintain a facade of normalcy. These children brave the long treks from home only to spend their day in makeshift tents, be it raining or freezing.  





You can make a difference!
We need your help to rebuild this school before winter sets in. The plans are ready. The new construction will source local materials as well as be earthquake resistant.



The Mountain Fund is an all volunteer, non-profit organization. We put 100% of donations on the ground and working in Nepal. 
We appreciate you taking the time to read about our project. All contributions are welcome and we encourage you to spread the word. Your generosity can make a tremendous difference but time is of the essence...Thank you!

<p>Foodologyoung.eu
è un progetto di scambio giovanile promosso dalle organizzazioni Zagreus e Geyc, supportato dal programma Erasmus+ dell’Unione Europea che si svolgerà a
Cosenza dal 22 al 29 Settembre 2015 con la partecipazione attiva al progetto di
40 giovani italiani e romeni. </p>
<p>L’obiettivo
di Foodologyoung.eu è quello di contrastare la diffusione di abitudini
alimentari scorrette tra i giovani, orientandoli verso un consumo consapevole e
rispettoso della natura e della salute.</p>
<p>I
partecipanti avranno l’opportunità di confrontarsi in un ambiente
interculturale, acquisendo competenze specifiche su: regimi alimentari, permacultura e agricoltura sinergica, Gruppi di Acquisto Solidale, filiere
corte e prodotti a Km 0, economia alternativa, realtà attive sul territorio in
tema di recupero della biodiversità e promozione delle buone pratiche
alimentari.</p>
<p>Le attività
svolte nell’ambito del progetto saranno documentate passo dopo passo in un
apposito BLOG  <a href=""http://www.foodologyoung.eu/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.foodologyoung.eu</a> costruito
secondo le moderne tecniche del digital storytelling.</p>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Cosa ci
serve - Cosa puoi fare </h3>
<p></p>
<p>Vogliamo
fare di Foodologyoung.eu un’occasione unica per promuovere il nostro territorio
e per creare delle relazioni proficue tra realtà che operano nel campo
dell’agricoltura sostenibile a livello locale, nazionale ed europeo. Al di là
dei seminari e delle attività già in programma, infatti,  stiamo cercando
di offrire ai giovani, che parteciperanno allo scambio, l’opportunità di
visitare alcune delle esperienze di <b>social and rural innovation</b> più
significative avviate in Calabria.  E tu potrai seguire queste storie in
tempo reale qui su <span><a href=""http://www.foodologyoung.eu/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.foodologyoung.eu</a>.</span> Purtroppo non
disponiamo delle risorse necessarie per spostare 40 persone. Ecco perché
chiediamo il tuo contributo. Anche se piccolo, è estremamente importante
per noi!</p>
<p>Nello
specifico, abbiamo bisogno di raggiungere almeno la  somma di €800,00 per poter consentire a coloro che parteciperanno al progetto di visitare le
seguenti realtà:</p>
<p></p>
<p>-  <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/casadelcarro?fref=ts"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Casa del Carro</a>  - Cultural Farm in Tortora, CS </p>

<p>I
contributi ricevuti saranno impiegati per noleggiare un autobus di 53 posti per
l'intera giornata del 24 settembre (Tortora) e 27 settembre (San Floro e
Belcastro) e per il vitto in trasferta. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Con il tuo contributo non dovremo tagliare le spese relative ai collaboratori!</span></p>
<p></p>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Perché è importante contribuire?</h3>
<p>L’attuale scenario globale è costantemente segnato
da crisi di natura economica, ambientale, umanitaria. Ciò è principalmente
dovuto al persistere di un modello produttivo senza regole, incentrato sullo
sfruttamento intensivo delle risorse naturali, con tutto quel che ne consegue
in termini di deterioramento dell’ecosistema e perdita della biodiversità. </p>
<p>La buona notizia è che negli ultimi anni, grazie
alla sensibilità, alla determinazione ed all’impegno di molti, stanno prendendo
sempre più piede delle alternative concrete, implementate da realtà che operano
“dal basso” con l’obiettivo di costruire un modello di sviluppo che metta
i  diritti dell’uomo e della natura al proprio centro.  </p>
<p>Anche in Calabria/Italia sono nate varie esperienze.  In tutto ciò, Foodologyoung.eu
rappresenta un contributo concreto, che punta a rafforzare le reti già
esistenti e a crearne di nuove, coinvolgendo attivamente le giovani
generazioni. </p>

<h3>Who we are</h3>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Foodologyoung.eu is an exchange project for young people,
presented and coordinated by the Italian organization Zagreus, in collaboration
with the Romanian partner GEYC and funded  by Erasmus+ program. The exchange experience, for the 40
participants, consists of an active participation to the project, which will
take place in Cosenza from the 22<sup>th</sup> to
the 29<sup>th</sup> September
2015. The purpose of Foodologyoung.eu is to contrast the diffusion of
unhealthy food habits among the young, guiding them to an aware and respectful
behaviour towards nature and health. Share best practices related to food
and rural tradition and rural innovation, comparing the experiences of the
countries of origin of the participants. Promote a healthy lifestyle
through the awareness of alternative. Transfer young people the importance
of farmers knowledge and traditions. Improve digital story telling
skills of the participants. Transfer knowledge on the principles and
practices of sustainable agriculture.</p>
<br/><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>We want that Foodologyoung.eu becomes a
great opportunity to promote our territories and to create a network of relationships
between people and organizations working in the field of sustainable agriculture
at the local, national and European level. </p>
<p>Beyond the seminars and activities
already planned in the program, we want to give to all participants of the
exchange the opportunity to visit some of the experiences of <b>social and rural
innovation </b>most significant undertaken in Calabria. Unfortunately we <span>haven't the resources to
move 40 people. That's why we are asking your contribution, although small, it
is extremely important to us!</span></p>
<p>This are some
of the interesting experiences in Calabria that we want to know and to tell their stories:</p>

piattaforma web che racconta le buone pratiche sul cibo 
in Europa. 
Fatta
dai giovani per i giovani                                                    
English version down

Foodologyoung.eu
è un progetto di scambio giovanile promosso dalle organizzazioni Zagreus e Geyc, supportato dal programma Erasmus+ dell’Unione Europea che si svolgerà a
Cosenza dal 22 al 29 Settembre 2015 con la partecipazione attiva al progetto di
40 giovani italiani e romeni. 
L’obiettivo
di Foodologyoung.eu è quello di contrastare la diffusione di abitudini
alimentari scorrette tra i giovani, orientandoli verso un consumo consapevole e
rispettoso della natura e della salute.
I
partecipanti avranno l’opportunità di confrontarsi in un ambiente
interculturale, acquisendo competenze specifiche su: regimi alimentari, permacultura e agricoltura sinergica, Gruppi di Acquisto Solidale, filiere
corte e prodotti a Km 0, economia alternativa, realtà attive sul territorio in
tema di recupero della biodiversità e promozione delle buone pratiche
alimentari.
Le attività
svolte nell’ambito del progetto saranno documentate passo dopo passo in un
apposito BLOG  www.foodologyoung.eu costruito
secondo le moderne tecniche del digital storytelling.

Cosa ci
serve - Cosa puoi fare 

Vogliamo
fare di Foodologyoung.eu un’occasione unica per promuovere il nostro territorio
e per creare delle relazioni proficue tra realtà che operano nel campo
dell’agricoltura sostenibile a livello locale, nazionale ed europeo. Al di là
dei seminari e delle attività già in programma, infatti,  stiamo cercando
di offrire ai giovani, che parteciperanno allo scambio, l’opportunità di
visitare alcune delle esperienze di social and rural innovation più
significative avviate in Calabria.  E tu potrai seguire queste storie in
tempo reale qui su www.foodologyoung.eu. Purtroppo non
disponiamo delle risorse necessarie per spostare 40 persone. Ecco perché
chiediamo il tuo contributo. Anche se piccolo, è estremamente importante
per noi!
Nello
specifico, abbiamo bisogno di raggiungere almeno la  somma di €800,00 per poter consentire a coloro che parteciperanno al progetto di visitare le
seguenti realtà:

-  Casa del Carro  - Cultural Farm in Tortora, CS 
- Orto di Famiglia  - Community vegetable garden in  San Floro, CZ 
- L'Alveare - Agrama - Social Farm in Belcastro, CZ

I
contributi ricevuti saranno impiegati per noleggiare un autobus di 53 posti per
l'intera giornata del 24 settembre (Tortora) e 27 settembre (San Floro e
Belcastro) e per il vitto in trasferta. Con il tuo contributo non dovremo tagliare le spese relative ai collaboratori!


Perché è importante contribuire?
L’attuale scenario globale è costantemente segnato
da crisi di natura economica, ambientale, umanitaria. Ciò è principalmente
dovuto al persistere di un modello produttivo senza regole, incentrato sullo
sfruttamento intensivo delle risorse naturali, con tutto quel che ne consegue
in termini di deterioramento dell’ecosistema e perdita della biodiversità. 
La buona notizia è che negli ultimi anni, grazie
alla sensibilità, alla determinazione ed all’impegno di molti, stanno prendendo
sempre più piede delle alternative concrete, implementate da realtà che operano
“dal basso” con l’obiettivo di costruire un modello di sviluppo che metta
i  diritti dell’uomo e della natura al proprio centro.  
Anche in Calabria/Italia sono nate varie esperienze.  In tutto ciò, Foodologyoung.eu
rappresenta un contributo concreto, che punta a rafforzare le reti già
esistenti e a crearne di nuove, coinvolgendo attivamente le giovani
generazioni. 
e inoltre ...
Contribuendo a questa campagna, sosterrai le artiste che hanno realizzato le orginali cartoline ""Good food makes..."". Infatti il 10% del tuo contributo andrà proprio a loro!  Arianna Sacripanti; Chiara Lamieri; Hoppipolla; Marta Gomez

Le
difficoltà…
Sappiamo che fare una donazione ad un progetto
sconosciuto e lontano geograficamente può creare una certa diffidenza, ma tu
 potrai essere con noi per tutto il percorso su www.foodologyoung.eu 
Paypal potrebbe creare qualche difficoltà...lo
sappiamo. Se vuoi darci una mano ugualmente e ricevere le nostre splendide e originali cartoline, vai sul nostro sito www.foodologyoung.eu e cerca How to Help per visualizzare modalità alternative
 per sostenerci!



Cosa altro puoi fare?

Il tuo supporto, di qualunque natura esso sia, è
importante per noi! Anche se non puoi contribuire economicamente, puoi comunque
aiutarci a promuovere il progetto e a diffondere questa campagna di raccolta
fondi. Spargi in giro la voce, posta il link di questa pagina sulle tue reti
sociali, giralo ai tuoi contatti e, se hai idee da proporci o voglia di partecipare
attivamente, mettiti direttamente in contatto con noi!
Grazie!

Foodologyoung.eu

The web platform that tells good food practices in Europe. 
Made by young people for young people.  



Who we are


Foodologyoung.eu is an exchange project for young people,
presented and coordinated by the Italian organization Zagreus, in collaboration
with the Romanian partner GEYC and funded  by Erasmus+ program. The exchange experience, for the 40
participants, consists of an active participation to the project, which will
take place in Cosenza from the 22th to
the 29th September
2015. The purpose of Foodologyoung.eu is to contrast the diffusion of
unhealthy food habits among the young, guiding them to an aware and respectful
behaviour towards nature and health. Share best practices related to food
and rural tradition and rural innovation, comparing the experiences of the
countries of origin of the participants. Promote a healthy lifestyle
through the awareness of alternative. Transfer young people the importance
of farmers knowledge and traditions. Improve digital story telling
skills of the participants. Transfer knowledge on the principles and
practices of sustainable agriculture.
What We Need & What You Get


We want that Foodologyoung.eu becomes a
great opportunity to promote our territories and to create a network of relationships
between people and organizations working in the field of sustainable agriculture
at the local, national and European level. 
Beyond the seminars and activities
already planned in the program, we want to give to all participants of the
exchange the opportunity to visit some of the experiences of social and rural
innovation most significant undertaken in Calabria. Unfortunately we haven't the resources to
move 40 people. That's why we are asking your contribution, although small, it
is extremely important to us!
This are some
of the interesting experiences in Calabria that we want to know and to tell their stories:

-  Casa del Carro  - Cultural Farm in Tortora, CS 
- Orto di Famiglia  - Community vegetable garden in  San Floro, CZ 
- L'Alveare - Agrama - Social Farm in Belcastro, CZ


The contributions
received will be used to hire a bus of 53 seats for the whole day of September
24 (Tortora) and 27 September (San Floro and Belcastro) and the food for the day. With your help we will not have to cut the Human Resources  expenses!
You can
follow the stories here www.foodologyoung.eu
and of course, with your contribution you will receive our original amazing postcards
""Good food makes ..."" made by Italian young artists. 10%
of your contribution will go to their own!  Arianna Sacripanti; Chiara Lamieri; Hoppipolla; Marta Gomez.

<h1><b>Engola in 60 seconds: </b></h1>
<p><b>Help us reach our new target of $750!</b></p>
<p><b>What is it?</b></p>
<p>An English app to help learners of English as a foreign language study in their own time.</p>
<p><b>Why is it special?</b></p>
<p>In our experience a lot of English apps make a basic mistake: they try to teach the whole English language via your phone, which as we all know is impossible - to speak a language well you need to practice it in real life, ideally with a teacher. </p>
<p>Learners can use Engola to <b>practice exactly what they want to know:</b> by choosing topics where they have problems or where they want to improve. It can answer these sorts of questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>What is the difference between 'used to' and 'get used to'?</b></li>
<li>Why can't we say ""much money"" when we can say ""not much money""?</li>
<li><b>How do we really use the present perfect?</b></li>
</ul>
<p>It will be <b>free to download and free to use</b>, and learners can select any piece of grammar that is causing them problems, check the topic and practice it. If they make an error, they can click for a specific explanation for that error, meaning they can learn from their mistakes and build their knowledge.</p>
<p><b>How much money do we need to start?</b></p>
<p><b>$500:</b> with this we can make a mini-app so people can try our idea.</p>
<p><b>$1000:</b> we can make an app for iOS, Android and Windows phones to explain grammar topics for intermediate level students.</p>

<b><h2>Ten English grammar books in one tiny app!</h2></b><p>I'm Jonathan, and I have been teaching English for the last seven years. A few months ago I was talking with my friend Peter, a computer programmer and one of my old students, about <strong>the best way to improve your English</strong>.</p>
<p>Peter said that now he had reached an advanced level in English but he still had some serious problems with parts of the grammar.</p>
<p>""That's totally normal."" </p>
<p>I advised him to sit down with a big grammar book and work through all the topics where he had some problems.</p>
<p>“It's a lovely idea,” he said, “But I'm too busy, I don't have time.”</p>
<p>“Well, why don’t you use an app instead? <b>Everybody has a few minutes in their day </b>when they can check their phone. There must be hundreds of English language apps available.”</p>
<p>He asked me to recommend one, but after a lot of searching we realised there wasn't much out there which could <i>really</i> help students learn, at least not without spending a lot of money on it first.</p>
<p>What we really wanted was a <strong>free, easy-to-use English learning app</strong> with all the grammar topics you need. An app which could actually teach you as you use it, allowing you to build your knowledge over time and learn from your mistakes.</p>
<p>So we decided to make it:</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>What actually is crowdfunding and how can I help?</b></p>
<p>It is a new way to help get new projects started - if someone likes an idea, they can give a little bit of money to show their support for the project. You can also share our campaign on Facebook or Twitter. You can choose from one of the perks on the right to receive a reward for your contribution.</p>
</div>
<div><b>Is Engola a business, or just for fun? </b></div>
<div>
<p>We want to give the first version of Engola away for free. However, in the future we would ideally like to start a company, and we may offer a more comprehensive learning programme in the future for a small charge. </p>
</div>

</ul>
<div>We really believe Engola will be useful for English learners and teachers  all over the world - if we get the support we need we expect to be able to launch the app for free downloading  in October 2016.</div>

<p>All children have a
right to live a childhood in which they thrive, develop, are protected and
participate in decisions that affect them. But for millions of children around
the globe, including the children in the orphanages we work with in Indonesia, the
reality of childhood is very different. Many are victims of violence or
exploitation. Some have only one parent who, in desperation, sends their young
child into the labor force to help put food on the table. Others have no family
at all and find themselves abandoned. </p>
<p>For many of these children,
finding a well paying job is next to impossible, as they lack the skills
required. While the orphanages provide basic food, shelter and protection, our
Entrepreneurship Program provides the opportunity for children to learn life skills and training to
be more competitive in the job market or enable them to start their own
business. Our focus is on building self-confidence, communication skills,
creativity and problem solving skills. <br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436799196/tglwjgj6vgpiescsadz5.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><b><u>Program Successes<br/></u></b>

Right now, we are bursting at the seams. We are turning away women-in-need that are looking for jobs. We have just received a generous donation of industrial sewing machines, equipment and supplies. To be able to use the donation, we need a building!</p> <ul> <li>While we have many needs, this campaign is to specifically address one key need : MORE SPACE. Currently, we are split between a space in Snellville, Ga. that houses our fabrics and a small room at an apartment complex in Clarkston that serves as a current local training center for the refugee women. After three years of watching a property on E. Ponce de Leon in Clarkston, Ga., the perfect central location we've been dreaming of has come up for rent.  <b>We want to open a larger central training center for refugee women that will continue teach the skill of sewing and provide jobs to these vulnerable women.</b>

<ul> <li>Our hearts are moved by the refugee crisis across the world. After harrowing journeys, only a few are chosen to be relocated to the United States as refugees. When these families do land, many of them have PTSD, depression, and a whole host of other issues. Our mission is to create jobs with a peaceful environment for vulnerable women. We have being doing this for 2.5 years and we are asking for your help to to do this in the BEST way. We want to see our refugee friends become <span style=""background-color: initial;"">self-sufficient, without having to rely on government assistance.  </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">As women of Peace, our purchases of Peace of Thread bags sew directly into the lives of these vulnerable woman.</span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">  <b>The funds from these purchases provides financial assistance to educate and empower her entire family.</b></span>

Ponce de Leon, in Clarkston, Ga. For this reason, we are looking to raise 1 years rent = $24,000.</li> <li>Any money raised above and beyond our goal will go to sponsor a woman. It costs $500 to train and provider her with the proper supplies.</li>

</div></div>","Short Summary Peace of Thread, Inc., founded in 2012, is a non-profit (501c3) based in Clarkston, Ga., a suburb of Atlanta, that is a hub for refugee resettlement.  We have employed women from Iraq, Burma, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Somalia (read the story here). Right now, we are bursting at the seams. We are turning away women-in-need that are looking for jobs. We have just received a generous donation of industrial sewing machines, equipment and supplies. To be able to use the donation, we need a building!  While we have many needs, this campaign is to specifically address one key need : MORE SPACE. Currently, we are split between a space in Snellville, Ga. that houses our fabrics and a small room at an apartment complex in Clarkston that serves as a current local training center for the refugee women. After three years of watching a property on E. Ponce de Leon in Clarkston, Ga., the perfect central location we've been dreaming of has come up for rent.  We want to open a larger central training center for refugee women that will continue teach the skill of sewing and provide jobs to these vulnerable women.



 Our hearts are moved by the refugee crisis across the world. After harrowing journeys, only a few are chosen to be relocated to the United States as refugees. When these families do land, many of them have PTSD, depression, and a whole host of other issues. Our mission is to create jobs with a peaceful environment for vulnerable women. We have being doing this for 2.5 years and we are asking for your help to to do this in the BEST way. We want to see our refugee friends become self-sufficient, without having to rely on government assistance.  As women of Peace, our purchases of Peace of Thread bags sew directly into the lives of these vulnerable woman.  The funds from these purchases provides financial assistance to educate and empower her entire family.








What We Need & What You Get In order to move to a larger more influential location and accept this amazing donation, we need:  $2000 a month for rent & utilities to rent a property off of E. Ponce de Leon, in Clarkston, Ga. For this reason, we are looking to raise 1 years rent = $24,000. Any money raised above and beyond our goal will go to sponsor a woman. It costs $500 to train and provider her with the proper supplies.
By donating, you get to partner with us to create hope and peace in the lives of these vulnerable women as they are adapting to their new lives in the United States.    The Impact Have you stopped in front of your T.V. listening to the reports of the war in Syria? Did you read Malala's book? Do you care about ending sex trafficking?
The refugee situation in Clarkston, Ga. is no different. We as women, can be a voice for other women. 
As conflicts rage on, the refugee crisis continues to grow bigger and has become a worldwide crisis. In Clarkston, Peace of Thread is positioning itself to not just give a woman a fish but to teach her to fish for a lifetime.
You TOO can become a voice in this crises:  You will be a part of creating a center for vulnerable women in need Your will us expand the numbers of employees
You can be an active part in supporting fashion that gives forward 



Risks & Challenges

  We've had many challenges in our journey, but feel blessed and prepared to make this move.
 Our biggest challenge is funding for a larger space to accommodate more volunteers and vulnerable women.    Other Ways You Can Help  Can you help us share this on Facebook/Instagram with your friends? Every voice is important and we'd love your help in making some noise.

<p>Joe L Brown has been a youth pastor for 35 years, husband of one wife for 30 years, father for 24 years, and founded the Christian Youth Film Society 21 years ago. Brown recently answered God's call to lead the Christian Youth Film Society full-time. ""After all these years of teaching kids to walk in faith - trust God - obey His Word; now I get to practice what I preach!"" says Brown. ""It's quite scary to leave a 35 year career as a church youth pastor and step into the unfamiliar world of building a non-profit. But it's also really exciting to see God's plan unfold before my eyes and know He loves me enough to grow my faith."" <img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p> <ul>
<li>
<i><u><a href=""http://www.movieguide.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Movieguide’s</a></u></i><u>
2014 Report to the Entertainment Industry</u> indicates that the public overwhelmingly
prefers to see movies with positive Christian content and values. According to <i>Movieguide's</i>
10-year study (2003-2012) of all major movies released by Hollywood, movies
with very strong Christian worldviews averaged $73 million in revenues, but
movies with very strong Non-Christian worldviews averaged only $21 million. <br/>
</li>
<li>Young people are inherently creative and want to tell compelling stories. Our Festivals, Film Camps, workshops, and events help guide young filmmakers and celebrate their gifts and talents. We help students learn to stand strong in their faith and values while telling faith-filled stories with excellence.<br/>
</li> <li>Your donations will help us continue serving young people, discovering and developing their talents, influencing their culture, and bringing light into the film industry and community.</li>
</ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Need<br/>
</h3> The Christian Youth Film Society has gotten bigger than I
 ever imagined. I believe God has called me to lead the ministry 
full-time. Many friends and family affirmed this decision, so I left my 
cushy and lucrative job as Youth Pastor and stepped out 
in faith that God would provide. I still get to work with youth, focusing on a specific field where there's great need and great potential. 
The film industry needs strong Christian missionaries to bring the light
 of Christ. We encourage talented young people who are called by God to take the
 faith into a career in film. <br/>As God guides, He provides. Will you allow Him to provide through you? Here are a few points of need:<br/> <ul> <li>The Festivals require staff, venue rental, awards, promotion, and technicians. <br/>
</li>
<li>Workshops, Events, and Film Camps need staff, promotion, venue, materials, mentors, and equipment.<br/>
</li> <li>Film Camps in Youth Correctional Facilities will be offered free of tuition, and also need staff, materials, mentors, and equipment.</li>
<li>Overall operating costs include staff, equipment, office, communications, insurance, travel, education, and promotions.</li>
<li>Our team is careful to use resources wisely as good stewards of all God has entrusted to us.<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>

<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>The Christian Youth Film Society is making a difference. Many of our students have entered film schools and universities. Many have pursued careers in the industry. Many have become media ministers in their churches. This program works!<br/></p> <ul> <li>Young people are challenged and equipped to stand strong in their faith in the face of darkness and attack.<br/>
</li> <li>Our graduates are working in the industry, bringing hope and truth, influencing key decision-makers and creative professionals.<br/>
</li> <li>With your help and as God leads, we plan to take the film camps and festivals to other cities and countries.<br/>
</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Risks<br/>
</h3> <p> It takes much time and dedication to work with youth. Our Executive Director, Joe Brown, needs adequate salary and benefits to stay connected and influential in the film industry, church ministries, and youth culture. He's proven his dedication and effectiveness through 35 years of successful youth ministry while building the Christian Youth Film Society. Now, as God has called him to lead the CYFS full-time, he will work diligently to build a strong financial and prayer support base through presentations, grant writing, and sponsor cultivation.<br/></p> <ul></ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Help</h3> <p>There's more than one way to help. Not everyone can contribute financially. But everyone can pray and share. Please let others know using the Indiegogo share tools. Please pray for wise stewardship, effective ministry, and faithful service. And please call, write, text, beat a drum, send smoke signals, or otherwise contact us and let us know how we can serve you too. Thanks a million, and God bless you!<br/></p>

Brown recently answered God's call to lead the Christian Youth Film Society full-time. ""After all these years of teaching kids to walk in faith - trust God - obey His Word; now I get to practice what I preach!"" says Brown. ""It's quite scary to leave a 35 year career as a church youth pastor and step into the unfamiliar world of building a non-profit. But it's also really exciting to see God's plan unfold before my eyes and know He loves me enough to grow my faith.""  

Movieguide’s
2014 Report to the Entertainment Industry indicates that the public overwhelmingly
prefers to see movies with positive Christian content and values. According to Movieguide's
10-year study (2003-2012) of all major movies released by Hollywood, movies
with very strong Christian worldviews averaged $73 million in revenues, but
movies with very strong Non-Christian worldviews averaged only $21 million. 

Young people are inherently creative and want to tell compelling stories. Our Festivals, Film Camps, workshops, and events help guide young filmmakers and celebrate their gifts and talents. We help students learn to stand strong in their faith and values while telling faith-filled stories with excellence.
 Your donations will help us continue serving young people, discovering and developing their talents, influencing their culture, and bringing light into the film industry and community.
   The Need
 The Christian Youth Film Society has gotten bigger than I
 ever imagined. I believe God has called me to lead the ministry 
full-time. Many friends and family affirmed this decision, so I left my 
cushy and lucrative job as Youth Pastor and stepped out 
in faith that God would provide. I still get to work with youth, focusing on a specific field where there's great need and great potential. 
The film industry needs strong Christian missionaries to bring the light
 of Christ. We encourage talented young people who are called by God to take the
 faith into a career in film. As God guides, He provides. Will you allow Him to provide through you? Here are a few points of need:  The Festivals require staff, venue rental, awards, promotion, and technicians. 

Workshops, Events, and Film Camps need staff, promotion, venue, materials, mentors, and equipment.
 Film Camps in Youth Correctional Facilities will be offered free of tuition, and also need staff, materials, mentors, and equipment.
Overall operating costs include staff, equipment, office, communications, insurance, travel, education, and promotions.
Our team is careful to use resources wisely as good stewards of all God has entrusted to us.

    The Impact The Christian Youth Film Society is making a difference. Many of our students have entered film schools and universities. Many have pursued careers in the industry. Many have become media ministers in their churches. This program works!  Young people are challenged and equipped to stand strong in their faith in the face of darkness and attack.
 Our graduates are working in the industry, bringing hope and truth, influencing key decision-makers and creative professionals.
 With your help and as God leads, we plan to take the film camps and festivals to other cities and countries.
    The Risks
  It takes much time and dedication to work with youth. Our Executive Director, Joe Brown, needs adequate salary and benefits to stay connected and influential in the film industry, church ministries, and youth culture. He's proven his dedication and effectiveness through 35 years of successful youth ministry while building the Christian Youth Film Society. Now, as God has called him to lead the CYFS full-time, he will work diligently to build a strong financial and prayer support base through presentations, grant writing, and sponsor cultivation.    The Help There's more than one way to help. Not everyone can contribute financially. But everyone can pray and share. Please let others know using the Indiegogo share tools. Please pray for wise stewardship, effective ministry, and faithful service. And please call, write, text, beat a drum, send smoke signals, or otherwise contact us and let us know how we can serve you too. Thanks a million, and God bless you!",12.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Study Smart is a game of life and
skill and can be played at home or in school.  It has been designed
especially for secondary and tertiary students looking to improve grades and
exam results. Study Smart teaches you how to study, with both life skills and
learning skills. It teaches you how to communicate effectively, how to wait for
your turn in life and how to win and lose. Not only is it a great family
activity, it teaches you and your kids excellent skills that they need in order
to pass their exams with flying colours.</p>
<p>The board game encompasses memory
skills and strategies, tips on how to learn, how to set up a study environment
that works, tips on exams, how to get motivated and, perhaps most importantly,
what not to do, in the form of Uh-Oh cards. The idea is to teach you how to
study smarter rather than harder. Exams are not meant to make a nervous wreck
out of you, they are meant to push you forward in life with confidence.</p>

All around the world teachers ask students to “go home and study” however they do not tell them how. Our mission is to ensure every student knows how to study smart to pass their exams. <br/><br/><p></p>

<p></p>
<p>I’m Karen Boyes, designer &amp; facilitator of the Study Smart workshops and webinars. I have previous designed an app: <a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/nz/app/istudyalarm/id395992117?mt=8#"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">iStudyAlarm</a> which students throughout the world are using to assist them in their study and keep them focused and on task. I have produced two rap songs, mini study videos and 2 books; 27 Study Tips for Success (now on it’s 12th reprint) and Study Smart e-book.  I have spent 21 years researching and refining my knowledge of how the brain learns and remembers and have presented this information in 18 countries.</p>Several years ago I started developing this game for students to learn how to study. It had been sitting on my shelf and I last year I pulled it out to play with students. They loved it. Not only were they engaged and focused while playing - they also were learning how to study, and practising all those ‘old fashion’ skills of taking turns, discussing, co-operating and being social. <br/><p>I see this game being used in classrooms - teachers might use it for study classes, form classes, wet lunchtimes and as a full on instruction on study skills - without the teacher needing any in-depth knowledge of neurology or brain functioning (the foundation of the tips within the game.)</p>
<p>This game will also be great in family homes, playing together as a family. Not only to teach the ideas for the students, it will give parents the confidence to know how to help their students at home. </p>

</p>
<p>So how does the game work? Each player is issued with a player profile. This states their current subjects, grades and the target to become an A+ student. Each player takes turns to move around the board and lands on one of 6 options; Learning Styles, Memory Strategies, Motivation, Study Tips, Study Environment and Uh-Oh’s. <img alt=""Example of cards"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/003/682/668/b4b5df74f6464f1ad96273ba406981b0_original.png?v=1430099107&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;lossless=true&amp;s=93d6a52df792c41e9d0787e18e195757"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>They then pick the corresponding card from the centre of the board, read it aloud so all players have the benefit of learning the tip. Each card has a tip and how many subject the players marks will increase if they use the tip. They then spin the spinner to find out how many marks they may increase. The player then adjusts their grades accordingly and also must record 3 tips from each category on their master sheet.

This will be great for students who have challenges with writing, reading and maths as it will allow them to use a dropdown menu to choose options rather than write or calculate by hand. We have seen mock ups in action working fabulously with dyslexic students and slow processors.


Here is a sneak preview - all 8 seconds of it!) of the board on the printing press... And check out Updates and Gallery for more production previews!

Our aim is now to get a board game into every school in New Zealand and Australia plus as many homes as we can. Then the world!
But wait - if you don't know me, my team and what we have already successfully created, keep reading. (If you do know and would like to see the extras we are hoping to provide please scroll down to the green-blue headings - with another $2000 we can ensure students with learning challenges can play the game online and benefit from the ideas and tips)

I’m Karen Boyes, designer & facilitator of the Study Smart workshops and webinars. I have previous designed an app: iStudyAlarm which students throughout the world are using to assist them in their study and keep them focused and on task. I have produced two rap songs, mini study videos and 2 books; 27 Study Tips for Success (now on it’s 12th reprint) and Study Smart e-book.  I have spent 21 years researching and refining my knowledge of how the brain learns and remembers and have presented this information in 18 countries.Several years ago I started developing this game for students to learn how to study. It had been sitting on my shelf and I last year I pulled it out to play with students. They loved it. Not only were they engaged and focused while playing - they also were learning how to study, and practising all those ‘old fashion’ skills of taking turns, discussing, co-operating and being social. I see this game being used in classrooms - teachers might use it for study classes, form classes, wet lunchtimes and as a full on instruction on study skills - without the teacher needing any in-depth knowledge of neurology or brain functioning (the foundation of the tips within the game.)
This game will also be great in family homes, playing together as a family. Not only to teach the ideas for the students, it will give parents the confidence to know how to help their students at home. 
The object of the game is to get the highest marks in all of your subjects. 

So how does the game work? Each player is issued with a player profile. This states their current subjects, grades and the target to become an A+ student. Each player takes turns to move around the board and lands on one of 6 options; Learning Styles, Memory Strategies, Motivation, Study Tips, Study Environment and Uh-Oh’s. 
They then pick the corresponding card from the centre of the board, read it aloud so all players have the benefit of learning the tip. Each card has a tip and how many subject the players marks will increase if they use the tip. They then spin the spinner to find out how many marks they may increase. The player then adjusts their grades accordingly and also must record 3 tips from each category on their master sheet. The winner is the person that has an A+ grade for each subject and 15 tips (3 in each area) recorded on their player sheet.

Our original goal was to fund the making of the game - and with the NSW Parent Association's support, we have done that! The game is now currently at the printers! Now we have new goals in place to increase students' abilities to study smart (see below for our exciting stretch goals!)Did you see the video above? Click here to watch...


Now we have some NEW stretch goals:
1. Create an online player sheet. This is great for students who have challenges with writing, reading and maths as it will allow them to use a dropdown menu to choose options rather than write or calculate by hand. I have already seen a mock up working fabulously with dyslexic students and slow processors.
The online player sheet can also be used to speed up the game. The concept of the game is to learn the tips and strategies.
2. Have a game in every school. With over 300 games all ready going into NSW schools, our goal is to have a game in every intermediate, junior high and secondary school in New Zealand and Australia. Please help us by pledging to buying or donating games to a school. 


The rules are simple to follow. The goal of each player is to become an A+ student with 15 individual study tips recorded on their game sheet.

</h1>
<p>Aren't you tired of cellular phones (smart or otherwise) that spy on you? Did you know that with almost all ""modern"" phones a skilled hacker or an overzealous government can hack into your phone over the air and not only siphon off all of your contact lists and pictures and what have you, but also surreptitiously turn on the microphone - without you ever knowing it - and listen in on whatever is happening at your dinner table, in your living room, in your bedroom or wherever your phone happens to be when, as far as you know, it's just sitting idle? These same spying phones also <i>actively volunteer</i> your exact GPS location (much more precise than needed for cellular network operation) to any hacker or governmental entity who knows how to request it - and there is absolutely no way to disable this self-incrimination feature.<br/></p>
<p>The reason why these corporate-made phones are able to betray the interests of the end user and serve someone else's interest instead is because they run proprietary software, also known as firmware. Proprietary software is software that is owned and controlled by someone other than its user, with the user being denied the ability to understand how it works, let alone modify or improve it.</p>
<h2>A better way</h2>
<p>Over the past decade a few small companies and community initiatives have tried to fix the problem of phones running proprietary software that works against the user. But only one of them got it right: <a href=""http://www.openmoko.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Openmoko</a>. The original Openmoko GTA01 and GTA02 phones whose production ended in 2009 had a vitally important user freedom and empowerment feature which is completely missing in all of the more recent projects and designs: a baseband processor that can run free software (firmware) instead of the proprietary kind.</p>
<p>Many community long-timers are familiar with the word ""baseband"", and cringe upon hearing it. The so-called baseband processor, also known as the modem or the radio processor, is the part of every cellular phone (smart or otherwise) that is responsible for connecting to the cellular network and making the device work as a phone. The reason why a lot of us cringe at hearing that word is because traditionally these cellular basebands have been the bastion of closedness and proprietary software. In every phone that has ever been made to the present day with the single exception of Openmoko GTA01/02, the baseband is the most closed and proprietary component, the component whose internal operation the user is absolutely forbidden from understanding, let alone improving. It is also naturally the component that is ideally suited for the insertion of privacy-violating backdoors by various shady entities.</p>
<p>The reason why Openmoko's baseband is so special and so different is because it was built using chips from Texas Instruments, as opposed to Qualcomm or Mediatek. The latter two companies are the ones that make the baseband processor chips used in virtually all mainstream phones made today. The prospects for being able to run free software (the kind of software that protects and empowers you instead of spying or otherwise working against you) on chips made by Qualcomm or Mediatek (and thus on any phone built with those chips) are extremely bleak: absolutely no technical documentation for the workings of these chips is available to mere mortals, and even if we got our own free firmware image built, the chip will most likely refuse to run it by way of its cryptographically locked bootloader.</p>
<p>But the older baseband chips from TI that were used by Openmoko are different in two major ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>These chips were made before cryptographically locked bootloaders were invented, hence they lack this malicious feature;</li>
<li>Through what may have been an act of divine intervention - we may never know - we, the free software community, now possess <b>all</b> technical documentation that is necessary in order to run our own free software on these GSM baseband chips from TI, 100% complete - and we even have the full source code for TI's official firmware to use as a reference. (All materials in question are <a href=""ftp://ftp.ifctf.org/pub/GSM/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">gathered on our FTP site</a>.)<br/>
</li>
</ol>
<p>While Openmoko, back in the days when they existed as a company and produced phones, shipped their phones with an official baseband firmware version that was just as proprietary as any other, they did so only because of legal restrictions, and any end user can very easily replace this proprietary baseband firmware with a <a href=""http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2013-October/069010.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">free version</a>.</p>
<h2>The problem WE need to solve</h2>
<p>What Openmoko produced in the late 2000s seems like the perfect solution to the problem of closed proprietary phones with closed proprietary basebands - but there is one problem with this solution. The problem is that Openmoko phones are no longer made: the last production batch was in 2009, and all remaining surplus has now been fully exhausted - and none of the newer post-Openmoko initiatives have retained the feature that matters, Openmoko's Calypso modem.<br/></p>
<p>The solution to THIS problem is obvious: we need to produce a series of new phones with the same TI Calypso baseband as used by Openmoko, the only cellular baseband chipset that currently exists in the world that can run fully free, fully functional firmware as opposed to the closed and proprietary kind. (The chips themselves are still available as surplus on the Chinese markets in very large quantities.)</p>
<h1>What we are doing</h1>
<p>Our long-term goal is to produce an entire family of GSM phone/modem devices that are based on the Calypso chipset and thus can run free firmware. (In fact, free is the only kind of firmware that will ever exist for our devices - no proprietary firmware is possible, as we are buying the chips on the surplus market and NOT entering into any NDAs with anyone.) The devices we envision producing include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A basic non-smart phone for those who dislike smartphones, yearn for a simpler phone that is specifically designed for talking to human beings rather than data, but wish to be free from proprietary software and from being spied upon.</li>
<li>A free-software baseband modem module that can be incorporated into free-software <a href=""http://www.neo900.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">smartphone designs by other teams</a>.</li>
<li>A standalone GSM/GPRS modem (with additional sweet capabilities like <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_Switched_Data"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">CSD</a>) for use with laptops, with either USB or plain old serial interface.</li>
</ul>
<p>But we need to start small. Right now we are working toward building our first proof-of-concept modem prototype, which will simply be the modem section of Openmoko's GTA02 phone extracted and separated from the rest of the design and built on a board by itself. It'll be powered from a lab bench power supply emulating the battery and both Calypso UARTs (interfaces for programming, control and data) will be brought out on headers.</p>
<p>We seek to replace Openmoko's triband radio front-end with a quadband one (making a GSM device anything less than quadband means that someone would have to be excluded, and we do not wish to exclude anyone), and this prototype board we currently seek to build will allow us to validate and prove our quadband design before we reuse it as a building block for more complex hardware designs approaching a final product.</p>
<p>We are a non-profit organization (although unfortunately not officially recognized as such yet), and we do <i>not</i> believe in the doctrine of ""intellectual property"". Absolutely everything we have produced in the past and will produce in the future, including the present family of projects, is in the public domain, free for anyone in the world to use as they see fit without asking us for permission. We apply this principle not only to software, but also to hardware: all design work is being done in public source repositories, and whenever we have a board design ready to be physically produced, we release the finished schematics, BOM, gerber files and editable PCB sources into the public domain via our FTP site. In other words, we create a ready-to-build design, but absolutely do not mind if someone else takes our work and runs with it into commercial production. We <i>want</i> you to ""pirate"" our work!</p>
<h2>Free firmware choices</h2>
<p>The Free Software community greatly values diversity and freedom of choice, and free firmware for phones with Calypso baseband processors is no exception. At the present time there is not just one but two independent free software projects seeking to produce fully free and fully functional GSM baseband firmware that can replace the proprietary kind: one is our own <a href=""https://bitbucket.org/falconian/freecalypso-sw"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">FreeCalypso</a> and the other is <a href=""http://bb.osmocom.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">OsmocomBB</a>. The two free firmware projects have somewhat different focus: OsmocomBB focuses on facilitating GSM hacking and security research, whereas our own FreeCalypso project seeks to produce free firmware for everyday use by ordinary end users.</p>
<p>When we build our own Calypso phones and modems that will run free firmware on the baseband processor, the choice of <i>which</i> free firmware to run remains with the user. While we naturally promote and support our own implementation, there will never be any obstacle to running OsmocomBB (or any other free firmware implementation that may appear in the future) on our hardware.<br/></p>
<h2>Our qualifications<br/>
</h2>
<p>The principal developer behind this project has been working toward the goal of a cellular phone free from proprietary software since 2011. Between 2011 and 2013 I gathered (through painstaking and meticulous scavenging) the most critical parts of our extensive collection of hardware documentation and reference source code that is now <a href=""ftp://ftp.ifctf.org/pub/GSM/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">amassed on our FTP site</a> (it never stops growing though), and since 2013 I've been working on the free firmware project linked above.<br/></p>
<p>But software/firmware work alone can only take us so far: now that the supply of pre-existing phones with the Calypso baseband chipset has been exhausted, it is time for us to build our own hardware with this chipset in order for the world at large to be able to benefit from our work.</p>
<p>In the case of Open Source Hardware development, my experience is that I have designed and built my own SDSL modem that serves my own Internet connection; you can read about that project, download all related design files (released free to the world as always) and see pictures of the gadget <a href=""http://ifctfvax.harhan.org/OpenWAN/OSDCU/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>. Thus I consider myself as qualified as anyone else for the job of building phones and modems with a free Calypso baseband.<br/></p>
<h1>What we need money for</h1>
<h1>
</h1>
<p>Our modem design will be based on the one in Openmoko's GTA02 phones. More specifically, we are copying many important aspects from Openmoko's original PCB layout. When we started this crowdfunding campaign at the beginning of April, Openmoko's original PCB layout files seemed to have been irretrievably lost. However, on April 10 we were very pleasantly surprised by Mr. Sean Moss-Pultz, the original founder of Openmoko, who was able to dig up a surviving copy of these files!</p>
<p>Had these PCB layout files not been found, we would have had to recover the layout by reverse engineering (slicing a sacrificial board to reveal and image its inner layers), and that venture would have cost us about $6000. Coming up with a way to cover that high cost was the original reason why we started this crowdfunding campaign, and that cost is what our goal figure has been based on.</p>
<p>However, now that we have recovered the original PCB layout files and don't need to spend $6k on reverse engineering, the campaign goal figure no longer has any significance. Whatever amount we manage to raise, be it small or large, will be used to help the project team - our core team members are currently having a very hard time, and the hardship is expected to last several months. It is very difficult to work on a free software or hardware design project while struggling to survive, so by helping the humans behind the project, you will be helping the project itself.</p>

raised in this campaign will be used to provide reading support in brand new communities! <br/></p>

–Traveling
Stories
Hi! My name is Emily Moberly and I'm the founder of Traveling Stories, a nonprofit organization that is outsmarting poverty one book at a time. An avid reader myself, I was shocked to see so many kids who thought their stories didn't matter and that reading was boring. 
I started Traveling Stories in an effort to change their minds! At Traveling Stories we believe that when this happens we'll have a 
population confident in their self worth and empowered with the critical
 thinking skills and strong imaginations they need to be able to 
outsmart poverty in their own communities.Meet Malikah 

Nine-year-old
Malika couldn’t sit still long enough to read an entire book when she first
came to the Traveling Stories StoryTent three years ago. One week, with help from a volunteer, she discovered the Madeline books by Ludwig Bemelman and couldn’t
put them down! This year Malika was reclassified at school from below average
to above average in reading. Her mom says this is a direct result of the time
she spends reading at the StoryTent every week. Click here to watch Malika's recent review of The Trumpet of the Swan!Why this campaign is needed ... 
Did you know that millions of people in the world can't read?
And it's not just adults, or developing countries ... 32 million Americans can't read and two-thirds of fourth graders in our own country cannot read at grade level. It's ridiculous, right? (US Dept of Education & NAEP)
Living in a world where people cannot read impacts those of us who can read. 
Did you know that the U.S. spends about $2 billion of taxpayer money every year on education for kids who repeat grades because of low literacy skills? (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services)Why does it matter if people can read? There is a direct correlation between poverty and illiteracy. If we can improve peoples' literacy skills, we can increase their chances of being healthy, productive, contributing members of society, which we believe is a win for everyone! 
Literacy & earnings potential: 
Literacy and health: 
 (Source: UNESCO) Our solution: We refuse to live in a world where people cannot read, so we're building libraries in villages where there are no books & providing free literacy coaching through StoryTents at farmers markers & other publics areas here in the U.S. We need your help to raise more funds so that we can create more libraries and StoryTents.
What we've done so far: 



What we can do with your help: 

With $25,000 we can

support this year! If we raise more, we can have an even bigger impact!

<p><b><i>Notre projet</i></b></p>
<p>Notre projet est de réintégrer, au
cours de l’année 2015, 10 autres jeunes enfants de la rue dans des familles
d’accueil afin de leur redonner un milieu de vie décent et leur permettre de
retourner sur les bancs d’école, ce qui est le rêve de tous ces enfants.</p>
<p>Le principe de fonctionnement est
relativement simple : une famille accepte d’accueillir un enfant de la rue
chez elle, de l’aimer et de subvenir à ses besoins de base comme l’un de ses
propres enfants. En échange de ce don, notre organisme donne à la famille une
vache ou des chèvres (selon le besoin), ce qui permet à cette famille d’améliorer
globalement sa situation financière et alimentaire. Ainsi, l’enfant intègre un
milieu familial qui bénéficie d’une certaine stabilité. Kira Burundi se charge
des démarches pour inscrire l’enfant à l’école publique, et pourvoit parfois
aux besoins de l’enfant en matière de matériel scolaire, selon les moyens de la
famille.</p>
<p>Les bénévoles de Kira Burundi sur le
terrain s’assurent que les enfants sont bien traités dans les familles et que
les familles et les enfants s’adaptent bien à leur nouvelle situation.</p>
<p>Mais ce n’est pas tout! Selon le
principe du donner au suivant, bien présent dans la tradition burundaise, le
premier-né de la vache ou des chèvres données à la famille sera redonné à
l’organisme. Cet animal sera donné à une nouvelle famille qui aura accepté
d’accueillir un enfant. Cette famille s’engagera elle aussi à redonner le
premier-né de ces animaux à l’organisme, et ainsi de suite. Ainsi, à terme, un
seul enfant réintégré permettra d’en réintégrer un, puis deux, puis trois, etc.
</p>
<p><b>Ce dont nous avons besoin</b></p>
<p>Nous avons besoin de 10 000 $
pour réintégrer ces 10 enfants de la rue. Les démarches de réintégration d’un
enfant coûtent, en tout, 1000 $ par enfant. Ce coût inclut l’achat de la vache
ou des chèvres et leur transport jusqu’au domicile familial (850 $), les
démarches de réinscription à l’école (50 $), les démarches légales pour la
signature du contrat avec la famille d’accueil (50$) et l’achat du matériel scolaire
pour les enfants pour la première année d’école (50 $). </p>
<p>Les bénévoles de Kira Burundi qui assurent le bon déroulement des démarches
sur le terrain ne sont pas rémunérés; ils effectuent toutes ces tâches
gratuitement, avec la conviction de réellement changer le monde et avec le
sourire des enfants et des familles comme seul salaire. <br/></p><p>La presse en parle:<br/></p><p><a href=""http://www.iwacu-burundi.org/kira-burundi-la-grandeur-des-petits-gestes/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.iwacu-burundi.org/kira-burundi-la-gr...</a></p><p><a href=""http://plus.lapresse.ca/screens/13caae27-be9e-42f9-9cbb-4556aa5240f1%7C_0.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://plus.lapresse.ca/screens/13caae27-be9e-42f9-9cbb-4556aa5240f1|_0.html</a><br/></p><p><br/></p>

d’accueillir un enfant. Cette famille s’engagera elle aussi à redonner le
premier-né de ces animaux à l’organisme, et ainsi de suite. Ainsi, à terme, un
seul enfant réintégré permettra d’en réintégrer un, puis deux, puis trois, etc.

Ce dont nous avons besoin
Nous avons besoin de 10 000 $
pour réintégrer ces 10 enfants de la rue. Les démarches de réintégration d’un
enfant coûtent, en tout, 1000 $ par enfant. Ce coût inclut l’achat de la vache
ou des chèvres et leur transport jusqu’au domicile familial (850 $), les
démarches de réinscription à l’école (50 $), les démarches légales pour la
signature du contrat avec la famille d’accueil (50$) et l’achat du matériel scolaire
pour les enfants pour la première année d’école (50 $). 
Les bénévoles de Kira Burundi qui assurent le bon déroulement des démarches
sur le terrain ne sont pas rémunérés; ils effectuent toutes ces tâches
gratuitement, avec la conviction de réellement changer le monde et avec le
sourire des enfants et des familles comme seul salaire. La presse en parle:http://www.iwacu-burundi.org/kira-burundi-la-gr...http://plus.lapresse.ca/screens/13caae27-be9e-42f9-9cbb-4556aa5240f1|_0.html

</h3><p>Engineers Without Boarders (EWB) is
an organization based in the USA that is committed to improving the quality of
life for less fortunate people all over the world. There are currently over
12,000 students, faculty and professionals that live and work all over the USA
who are members of the organization. Since its start in 2005 the Marquette chapter
of EWB has focused most of its efforts in small villages in Guatemala who need
better access to electricity and pedestrian bridges to help make transportation
possible and easier during the rain season. This specific fundraising campaign will
help nearly 400 people located in a village near the Patio Bol River in
Guatemala. The people in this area during three to four months out of the year
have their access to health care, education, work, and other things cut off
because the water levels rise to heights that don’t allow them to safely cross
the river. EWB-Marquette feels that everybody should have access to these things at
all times, so we are going to build this pedestrian bridge to give them access to these things year round.  </p>
<p>As the people in the villages of
Guatemala need and appreciate our help doing these projects that we as
engineers love, we need and will greatly appreciate your help in a form of
donation or by simply spreading the word about EWB-Marquette to your friends and
families. Our goal is to pay for two Marquette students to go on the next
EWB-Marquette trip to Guatemala. We have estimated the cost for each student to attend be $1500, so our
total fund raising goal will be $3000. The cost of each student includes their
travel for the trip, food and shelter during their stay, as well as the tools
and supplies they will need to build the bridges. Below is a list of really
cool gifts that we will be giving away based on the amount you donate to our

completion of each one we are on the look out for the next way we can make an
impact. There are things we all take for granted sometimes because we have access to them at all times. We have modes of transportation that allow us to
go through our daily life routine regardless of the type of weather there is
outside. Unfortunately the people who live in these villages lives have been
controlled by what mother nature throws at them. With of the help of EWB-MU and

</div>
<p>My name is Ryan Aulton, I am co-owner
of Pleasant Cyclery in beautiful Gainesville FL and I’m the Executive Director
of the newly formed not-for-profit, The Freewheel Project.  We are
starting a grassroots campaign to support the culture of cycling in all its
forms in our community and beyond.  We are an ambitious group on the verge
of making big changes in the way cycling is perceived as a form of transportation,
tourism, exercise, and sport.</p>
<p>In 2009 I
co-opened Pleasant Cyclery on a bare bones budget and have had the best time
ever since.<span>  It’s hard to express the joy
I feel being able to work with <b>“the greatest machine ever made”</b> and to form the
important personal relationships within such an amazing community and culture.  It’s also given me a unique insight into the
problems cycling faces in our community. 
I’ve found the biggest setbacks are a lack of education, accessibility,
and infrastructure.  </span></p>
<p>My goal has always been to provide a
public service, but the
opportunities to step away from Pleasant Cyclery never presented themselves. Two
years ago, I began to notice a tremor in my left hand.<span>  Six months later, coinciding with the birth
of my son, Daniel Matthew, I was diagnosed with early onset Parkinson’s disease
at age 32.  Although my wrenching has
gotten a bit slower, I’ve been very fortunate to have a tremor dominate form of
the disease, which is less aggressive in progression and manageable for the
foreseeable future. The combination of
these major life changes has given me a new outlook on life and has inspired me
to really enjoy my life, and try to spread joy everyday.  And what I enjoy the most is my family, the
bicycle, and the culture it fosters.  I
began to work on a plan to create a long-term resource for the community that
would be sustainable, and cater to solving the problems that face the culture
of cycling.</span></p>
<p>So, with a
little help from my friends, I present to you…</p>
<h3><b>The Freewheel Project.</b></h3>
<p>The
Freewheel Project is a combination of several things, but it all focuses around
our 12,200 sq. ft. historic warehouse on 2.7 acres in the SoMa district in
downtown Gainesville.  After several months of negotiations and sleepless
nights, we successfully leased this structure for 10 years at a generous rate.
Further, our lease granted us the ability to sublease the nearly 9,000 sq. ft.
of space not planned for The Freewheel Project.  After initial
renovations, the revenue from the subleases will completely subsidize The
Freewheel Project's rent, insurance, and utilities.  This will allow us to
operate a low cost, education-based bike shop, a bike collective, and classroom
(see the list below for details) in 3,500 square feet of space, pay a full time
bike mechanic, and run a slew of initial community outreach programs for an
annual budget of $40,000.  This incredibly obtainable number can and will
be reached through the profits from our bike shop, bike donations from the
public and property management companies, collective membership dues, and
monthly mini-fundraisers we can host on-site.  <b>This sustainable funding
model ensures that these initial infrastructure and program goals will be
operating long into the future with zero additional funding. </b></p>
<p>For a detailed
list of our 2015 programs and goals, please follow this link:</p>

<h3><b>Our Investment</b></h3>
<p>Our initial investment
to secure the building was $7,000.  We are in the process of using $15,000
to renovate and refurbish the inside of this beautiful space to maximize rent
we'll receive. This will allow us to fully subsidize The Freewheel Project's
rent and give us the freedom to put all future incoming monies back into the
community through the funding of new or expanded programs.  Additionally,
$5,000 will go into the rehab of the exterior (which is currently painted all
black) in order to create a welcoming space that fits with the urban design and
feel of the SoMa district.  Finally, we've budgeted approximately $2,000
to building our cross-crit track and cleaning up the exterior 2 acres and
turning it into one of Gainesville's most sought after event spaces.</p>
<p>We’ve secured
$36,500 in cash and in-kind donations from Board Member contributions,
Community member donations, our merger with The Kickstand (Gainesville’s
previous community bicycle project), a low interest loan, and bicycle donations
from Pleasant Cyclery. </p>
<h3><b>Your Investment</b></h3>
<p><b>In
a nutshell...</b></p>
<p>Your
investment will go towards developing a long-term solution to the problem of
accessibility and engagement in the cycling community.  Our plans for your
investment include: </p>
<p><b>-
building out our shop space and classroom </b></p><b>
</b><p><b>-
buying tools, equipment, and inventory for our low cost bike shop  </b></p><b>
</b><p><b>-
buying tool sets for our tool library and bikes for our bike library  </b></p>
<p>And
if funds allow, purchase the bikes needed for Teen Freewheel Cycling (though
we're actively seeking a corporate in-kind donation from a bicycle
manufacturer).  </p>
<p>If
we can't reach our entire fundraising goal it won't discourage us and it
shouldn't discourage you.  We'll still get the wheel rolling.  Your
investment will go towards insuring the sustainability of this project.

<p></p></div>","We're looking to help cycling reach it's full potential.    



My name is Ryan Aulton, I am co-owner
of Pleasant Cyclery in beautiful Gainesville FL and I’m the Executive Director
of the newly formed not-for-profit, The Freewheel Project.  We are
starting a grassroots campaign to support the culture of cycling in all its
forms in our community and beyond.  We are an ambitious group on the verge
of making big changes in the way cycling is perceived as a form of transportation,
tourism, exercise, and sport.
In 2009 I
co-opened Pleasant Cyclery on a bare bones budget and have had the best time
ever since.  It’s hard to express the joy
I feel being able to work with “the greatest machine ever made” and to form the
important personal relationships within such an amazing community and culture.  It’s also given me a unique insight into the
problems cycling faces in our community. 
I’ve found the biggest setbacks are a lack of education, accessibility,
and infrastructure.  
My goal has always been to provide a
public service, but the
opportunities to step away from Pleasant Cyclery never presented themselves. Two
years ago, I began to notice a tremor in my left hand.  Six months later, coinciding with the birth
of my son, Daniel Matthew, I was diagnosed with early onset Parkinson’s disease
at age 32.  Although my wrenching has
gotten a bit slower, I’ve been very fortunate to have a tremor dominate form of
the disease, which is less aggressive in progression and manageable for the
foreseeable future. The combination of
these major life changes has given me a new outlook on life and has inspired me
to really enjoy my life, and try to spread joy everyday.  And what I enjoy the most is my family, the
bicycle, and the culture it fosters.  I
began to work on a plan to create a long-term resource for the community that
would be sustainable, and cater to solving the problems that face the culture
of cycling.
So, with a
little help from my friends, I present to you…
The Freewheel Project.
The
Freewheel Project is a combination of several things, but it all focuses around
our 12,200 sq. ft. historic warehouse on 2.7 acres in the SoMa district in
downtown Gainesville.  After several months of negotiations and sleepless
nights, we successfully leased this structure for 10 years at a generous rate.
Further, our lease granted us the ability to sublease the nearly 9,000 sq. ft.
of space not planned for The Freewheel Project.  After initial
renovations, the revenue from the subleases will completely subsidize The
Freewheel Project's rent, insurance, and utilities.  This will allow us to
operate a low cost, education-based bike shop, a bike collective, and classroom
(see the list below for details) in 3,500 square feet of space, pay a full time
bike mechanic, and run a slew of initial community outreach programs for an
annual budget of $40,000.  This incredibly obtainable number can and will
be reached through the profits from our bike shop, bike donations from the
public and property management companies, collective membership dues, and
monthly mini-fundraisers we can host on-site.  This sustainable funding
model ensures that these initial infrastructure and program goals will be
operating long into the future with zero additional funding. 
For a detailed
list of our 2015 programs and goals, please follow this link:
https://drive.google.com/open?id=0ByziRN46SnGwO...
Our Investment
Our initial investment
to secure the building was $7,000.  We are in the process of using $15,000
to renovate and refurbish the inside of this beautiful space to maximize rent
we'll receive. This will allow us to fully subsidize The Freewheel Project's
rent and give us the freedom to put all future incoming monies back into the
community through the funding of new or expanded programs.  Additionally,
$5,000 will go into the rehab of the exterior (which is currently painted all
black) in order to create a welcoming space that fits with the urban design and
feel of the SoMa district.  Finally, we've budgeted approximately $2,000
to building our cross-crit track and cleaning up the exterior 2 acres and
turning it into one of Gainesville's most sought after event spaces.
We’ve secured
$36,500 in cash and in-kind donations from Board Member contributions,
Community member donations, our merger with The Kickstand (Gainesville’s
previous community bicycle project), a low interest loan, and bicycle donations
from Pleasant Cyclery. 
Your Investment
In
a nutshell...
Your
investment will go towards developing a long-term solution to the problem of
accessibility and engagement in the cycling community.  Our plans for your
investment include: 
-
building out our shop space and classroom 
-
buying tools, equipment, and inventory for our low cost bike shop  
-
buying tool sets for our tool library and bikes for our bike library  
And
if funds allow, purchase the bikes needed for Teen Freewheel Cycling (though
we're actively seeking a corporate in-kind donation from a bicycle
manufacturer).  
If
we can't reach our entire fundraising goal it won't discourage us and it
shouldn't discourage you.  We'll still get the wheel rolling.  Your
investment will go towards insuring the sustainability of this project. 
All funds will be put towards making the shop functional for service, sales,
and education while also outfitting the collective with the parts needed to be
successful.  As these aspects generate revenue, we'll be able to implement
the projects and programs that we were not able to initially fund through this
campaign. So, your investments foster further funding.  Think of yourself
as a one-time, sustaining investor.       
Your
contribution is vital to increasing the success and impact of The Freewheel
Project.  Not only will we be a community
resource for the 39% of Gainesville residents who live at or below the poverty
line, we will also be a home for the cycling culture in all its
variations.  Every dollar we raise goes
back into the programs and services we provide, and we want to do a lot.  Help us build the dream and make cycling fun

<p>Talibé is an Arabic word, meaning disciple or student. It primary describes young boys between the age of 5 to 18 years. Most of them are sent by their families to the Marabouts (religious teachers), to study the Coran in a Daraa (School of Coran) in Senegal. These young children often stem from destitute families living in underdeveloped, rural areas and also neighbouring countries (Guinea-Bissau, Guinea, The Gambia, Mali). </p>
<p>The majority of the Talibe children are living in a very precarious sanitary, health and nutritional situation, because the Marabouts do not take any care of them. Therefore they have to go into the streets to beg for food and money. Spend one day on the streets of St.Louis and you are guaranteed to encounter little boys, armed with empty tomato cans that they use as bowls for the food they receive. </p>

The Projects...
Bike Shelters at Blue Heron School in Port Townsend and Chimacum Creek Primary School (Materials: $12,350)These shelters are a community-wide effort and will provide a safe and dry place for students to store their bicycles so they will ride more often. Neither school has any covered outdoor space, so those who walk will soon have a place to wait out of the rain. We received a $2,500 grant through WSU from an Oregon State University obesity prevention project called GROW HKC (Healthy Kids and Communities) but need much more. Construction started in mid April at Blue Heron and we have over $10,000 of design, engineering, excavation, concrete, labor and miscellaneous labor and hardware donated by dozens of businesses and volunteers. The ribbon cutting ceremony will be Friday, May 1stat 2:30pm, a wonderful kick-off for National Bike Month.

<h2>Quienes somos.</h2>
<p>Juan José Santana es mi nombre, estudié ciencias de la comunicación gracias a una beca que conseguí por jugar basketball. Conseguir la beca no fue fácil, me esforcé por varios años para mejorar mi juego y me mantuve con un nivel aceptable en el aspecto académico, pero además de eso, mi buena suerte tuvo mucho que ver.</p>
<p>Mi historia no es una especial, de hecho es lo contrario, de esto me di cuenta cuando ingresé al equipo representativo de la UDLAP y noté que varios de mis compañeros habían transitado un camino similar para llegar ahí.</p>
<p>El caso de Josue Ruiz Ochoa es uno de ellos. A pesar de contar con un inusual talento para jugar, Josue muchas veces encontró obstáculos en su vida que intentaron desviarlo de su destino en este deporte. Muchos de estos obstáculos podrían haberse presentado para otros jugadores y eso es precisamente lo que queremos evitar mediante la implementación de un programa sólido de reclutamiento, denominado Tu Futuro Basketball (TFB).</p>
<p>Josue es el creador de TFB, un programa de reclutamiento que pretende brindar de estructura al deporte ráfaga de nuestro país, creando un puente entre el recluta talentoso y la institución de educación superior que tiene una beca disponible para él.</p>
<p>TFB se encuentra en su segundo año de actividades, buscando consolidarse gracias a alianza estratégica con la Liga ABE (Asociación de Baloncesto Estudiantil). En su primer ciclo, TFB logró generar el puente entre una decena de estudiantes atletas e instituciones universitarias, gracias a la exposición que el programa obtuvo en el evento principal, denominado Elite Camp.</p>
<p>En nuestra campaña queremos unir a la comunidad basketbolera en México, que las diferencias entre entrenadores, jugadores, instituciones y ligas puedan dejarse de lado por un momento, y que podamos convencer a todos los que integran esa comunidad de que TFB es un programa beneficioso para el deporte nacional.</p> <p>Las aportaciones que se hagan nos ayudarán a darle un empujón al programa, estableciéndolo así como el único en el país y asegurando que cientos de prospectos talentosos puedan año con año gozar de un espacio para mostrarse ante reclutadores y entrenadores universitarios. Creemos firmemente que esto tendrá dos efectos positivos, el primero de ellos consiste en fortalecer de manera importante el basketball nacional, ya que si mejores atletas están presentes en la Liga ABE, mejores atletas egresarán y posteriormente ingresarán al basketball profesional, alimentando después a la selección nacional, en ambas ramas. El segundo efecto positivo tiene que ver con la preparación profesional que los estudiantes atletas gozarán al estudiar en universidades de prestigio en México, las cuales participan en la Liga ABE y están siempre en búsqueda de los mejores elementos para integrar sus programas.</p>
<h2>Lo que necesitamos y lo que obtienes.</h2> <p>Nuestra meta es reunir  10 mil dólares, cantidad correspondiente aproximada a 175 mil pesos mexicanos. TFB ha funcionado hasta el momento gracias al esfuerzo de un escaso staff, que se ha movido con esfuerzos económicos propios, y para continuar con el impulso que se generó ya, buscamos obtener un empujón de nuestra comunidad.</p> <p>Son tres necesidades que cubriremos con el recurso recaudado.</p>
<p>La primera es la creación y mantenimiento de la plataforma en línea de TFB. Esta plataforma permitirá una interacción sencilla entre reclutas y reclutadores, entrenadores y prospectos, en general se perfila como una red de información en la que la comunicación entre instituciones e individuos será posible.</p> <p>La segunda necesidad es el correcto desarrollo del Elite Camp, evento donde los mejores reclutas muestran su talento con miras a integrarse a un programa universitario.</p>
<p>El tercer sector donde se invertirá recurso es en la organización de campamentos de evaluación alrededor de la República Mexicana, en lo que será la primera etapa de nuestro tercer ciclo anual, con énfasis en visitar comunidades en las que no hemos estado presentes en los primeros años de trabajo, localidades en las que la práctica del basketball está en auge, pero también visitar comunidades económicamente desfavorecidas.</p> <p>Nuestras recompensas están pensadas para todos aquellos que el basketball los mueve, los apasiona.</p>
<p>Más allá de nuestro eterno agradecimiento por contribuir con nuestra causa, quienes colaboren podrán recibir desde kit deportivos oficiales de TFB, hasta presencia física y en imagen durante nuestro Elite Camp. A nuestra campaña se han unido en etapas tempranas colaboradores como Spalding México, 143buzzgame y Dezzo, además del artista mexicano Chaket Gómez de Bver Studio (bverstudio en Instagram), quienes han contribuido con productos oficiales para recompensar a nuestra comunidad.</p> <p>Si no se lograra la meta total, nuestros fondos de igual forma serán de gran ayuda y se destinarán a la creación de nuestra plataforma y al desarrollo del Elite Camp.</p>
<h2>  El impacto.</h2>
<p>Tu Futuro Basketball refleja el espíritu de superación que tiene el basketball mexicano. El ayudarnos logrará que:</p> <p>-La comunidad basketbolera en México se una bajo un mismo proyecto, en beneficio exclusivo del deportista y de la competencia.</p>
<p>-Se cimente una estructura de reclutamiento sin precedentes en el deporte de nuestro país.</p>
<p>-Más y mejores atletas consigan la exposición necesaria de sus talentos ante reclutadores universitarios.</p>
<p>-Un reclutamiento eficiente para las instituciones universitarias a bajo costo.</p>
<p>-TFB llegue a todos los rincones de México, consiguiendo un censo completo del talento juvenil. </p>
<h2>Riesgos y desafíos.</h2>
<p>Estamos conscientes que al finalizar la campaña estaremos fortalecidos, sin embargo nuestra batalla por establecer a TFB como un programa exitoso de reclutamiento no termina ahí. Actualmente, a la par de esta campaña, estamos ejecutando varias acciones para asegurar que nuestro programa siga funcionando.</p>
<p>Establecernos como una Asociación Civil es el primer paso para solventar económicamente nuestro proyecto. </p>
<p>La implementación de un ambicioso plan de mercadotecnia está en puerta, con lo que lograremos darnos a conocer a nivel nacional, buscando en paralelo el apoyo de la iniciativa privada.</p>
<p>La diversificación de nuestro giro está en planes, con ejecución de reclutamiento en otros niveles del basketball mexicano.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Otras formas en las que puedes ayudar.</h2>
<h2> </h2>
<p>Algunas personas simplemente no pueden hacer aportaciones económicas, pero eso no significa que sean incapaces de contribuir con nuestra causa.</p>
<p>El pasar la voz y compartir nuestra campaña mediante las herramientas de Indiegogo es también valioso para TFB.</p>
<p>Gracias por tu apoyo. Recuerda, el futuro del basketball mexicano depende de todos.</p>

<h2><strong>Who are we?</strong></h2>
<p>My name is Juan José Santana, I studied communications science because I was granted a scholarship due to my basketball skills. Getting that scholarship wasn’t easy, I put a lot of effort for a few years so I could improved my game, and I also kept an acceptable academic level, besides all of that, it was luck that got me where I wanted to be.</p>
<p>I realized that my story was not unique as soon as I got in the basketball team, in fact, a lot of my teammates went trough something similar.</p>
<p>Josue Ruis Ochoa is one of them. Spite of having an inusual talent to play basketball, Josue found a lot of obstacles in his life that tried to prevent him from getting his dreams fulfilled.</p>
<p>This scenario could’ve been the same for other players, and that is precisely what we are intended to avoid by implementing a solid recruitment program that we named Tu Futuro Basketball (Your Future Basketball).</p>
<p>Josue came up with this program that tries to bring some structure to mexican basketball, that closes the gap between a talented prospect and the college or university that has an available scholarship for him or her.</p>
<p>TFB is currently in its second year of activities, establishing itself due to a strategic alliance with ABE League (Association that organizes collegiate basketball in Mexico).

Juan José Santana es mi nombre, estudié ciencias de la comunicación gracias a una beca que conseguí por jugar basketball. Conseguir la beca no fue fácil, me esforcé por varios años para mejorar mi juego y me mantuve con un nivel aceptable en el aspecto académico, pero además de eso, mi buena suerte tuvo mucho que ver.
Mi historia no es una especial, de hecho es lo contrario, de esto me di cuenta cuando ingresé al equipo representativo de la UDLAP y noté que varios de mis compañeros habían transitado un camino similar para llegar ahí.
El caso de Josue Ruiz Ochoa es uno de ellos. A pesar de contar con un inusual talento para jugar, Josue muchas veces encontró obstáculos en su vida que intentaron desviarlo de su destino en este deporte. Muchos de estos obstáculos podrían haberse presentado para otros jugadores y eso es precisamente lo que queremos evitar mediante la implementación de un programa sólido de reclutamiento, denominado Tu Futuro Basketball (TFB).
Josue es el creador de TFB, un programa de reclutamiento que pretende brindar de estructura al deporte ráfaga de nuestro país, creando un puente entre el recluta talentoso y la institución de educación superior que tiene una beca disponible para él.
TFB se encuentra en su segundo año de actividades, buscando consolidarse gracias a alianza estratégica con la Liga ABE (Asociación de Baloncesto Estudiantil). En su primer ciclo, TFB logró generar el puente entre una decena de estudiantes atletas e instituciones universitarias, gracias a la exposición que el programa obtuvo en el evento principal, denominado Elite Camp.
En nuestra campaña queremos unir a la comunidad basketbolera en México, que las diferencias entre entrenadores, jugadores, instituciones y ligas puedan dejarse de lado por un momento, y que podamos convencer a todos los que integran esa comunidad de que TFB es un programa beneficioso para el deporte nacional. Las aportaciones que se hagan nos ayudarán a darle un empujón al programa, estableciéndolo así como el único en el país y asegurando que cientos de prospectos talentosos puedan año con año gozar de un espacio para mostrarse ante reclutadores y entrenadores universitarios. Creemos firmemente que esto tendrá dos efectos positivos, el primero de ellos consiste en fortalecer de manera importante el basketball nacional, ya que si mejores atletas están presentes en la Liga ABE, mejores atletas egresarán y posteriormente ingresarán al basketball profesional, alimentando después a la selección nacional, en ambas ramas. El segundo efecto positivo tiene que ver con la preparación profesional que los estudiantes atletas gozarán al estudiar en universidades de prestigio en México, las cuales participan en la Liga ABE y están siempre en búsqueda de los mejores elementos para integrar sus programas.
Lo que necesitamos y lo que obtienes. Nuestra meta es reunir  10 mil dólares, cantidad correspondiente aproximada a 175 mil pesos mexicanos. TFB ha funcionado hasta el momento gracias al esfuerzo de un escaso staff, que se ha movido con esfuerzos económicos propios, y para continuar con el impulso que se generó ya, buscamos obtener un empujón de nuestra comunidad. Son tres necesidades que cubriremos con el recurso recaudado.
La primera es la creación y mantenimiento de la plataforma en línea de TFB. Esta plataforma permitirá una interacción sencilla entre reclutas y reclutadores, entrenadores y prospectos, en general se perfila como una red de información en la que la comunicación entre instituciones e individuos será posible. La segunda necesidad es el correcto desarrollo del Elite Camp, evento donde los mejores reclutas muestran su talento con miras a integrarse a un programa universitario.
El tercer sector donde se invertirá recurso es en la organización de campamentos de evaluación alrededor de la República Mexicana, en lo que será la primera etapa de nuestro tercer ciclo anual, con énfasis en visitar comunidades en las que no hemos estado presentes en los primeros años de trabajo, localidades en las que la práctica del basketball está en auge, pero también visitar comunidades económicamente desfavorecidas. Nuestras recompensas están pensadas para todos aquellos que el basketball los mueve, los apasiona.
Más allá de nuestro eterno agradecimiento por contribuir con nuestra causa, quienes colaboren podrán recibir desde kit deportivos oficiales de TFB, hasta presencia física y en imagen durante nuestro Elite Camp. A nuestra campaña se han unido en etapas tempranas colaboradores como Spalding México, 143buzzgame y Dezzo, además del artista mexicano Chaket Gómez de Bver Studio (bverstudio en Instagram), quienes han contribuido con productos oficiales para recompensar a nuestra comunidad. Si no se lograra la meta total, nuestros fondos de igual forma serán de gran ayuda y se destinarán a la creación de nuestra plataforma y al desarrollo del Elite Camp.
  El impacto.
Tu Futuro Basketball refleja el espíritu de superación que tiene el basketball mexicano. El ayudarnos logrará que: -La comunidad basketbolera en México se una bajo un mismo proyecto, en beneficio exclusivo del deportista y de la competencia.
-Se cimente una estructura de reclutamiento sin precedentes en el deporte de nuestro país.
-Más y mejores atletas consigan la exposición necesaria de sus talentos ante reclutadores universitarios.
-Un reclutamiento eficiente para las instituciones universitarias a bajo costo.
-TFB llegue a todos los rincones de México, consiguiendo un censo completo del talento juvenil. 
Riesgos y desafíos.
Estamos conscientes que al finalizar la campaña estaremos fortalecidos, sin embargo nuestra batalla por establecer a TFB como un programa exitoso de reclutamiento no termina ahí. Actualmente, a la par de esta campaña, estamos ejecutando varias acciones para asegurar que nuestro programa siga funcionando.
Establecernos como una Asociación Civil es el primer paso para solventar económicamente nuestro proyecto. 
La implementación de un ambicioso plan de mercadotecnia está en puerta, con lo que lograremos darnos a conocer a nivel nacional, buscando en paralelo el apoyo de la iniciativa privada.
La diversificación de nuestro giro está en planes, con ejecución de reclutamiento en otros niveles del basketball mexicano.
 
 
Otras formas en las que puedes ayudar.
 
Algunas personas simplemente no pueden hacer aportaciones económicas, pero eso no significa que sean incapaces de contribuir con nuestra causa.
El pasar la voz y compartir nuestra campaña mediante las herramientas de Indiegogo es también valioso para TFB.
Gracias por tu apoyo. Recuerda, el futuro del basketball mexicano depende de todos.
 
Who are we?
My name is Juan José Santana, I studied communications science because I was granted a scholarship due to my basketball skills. Getting that scholarship wasn’t easy, I put a lot of effort for a few years so I could improved my game, and I also kept an acceptable academic level, besides all of that, it was luck that got me where I wanted to be.
I realized that my story was not unique as soon as I got in the basketball team, in fact, a lot of my teammates went trough something similar.
Josue Ruis Ochoa is one of them. Spite of having an inusual talent to play basketball, Josue found a lot of obstacles in his life that tried to prevent him from getting his dreams fulfilled.
This scenario could’ve been the same for other players, and that is precisely what we are intended to avoid by implementing a solid recruitment program that we named Tu Futuro Basketball (Your Future Basketball).
Josue came up with this program that tries to bring some structure to mexican basketball, that closes the gap between a talented prospect and the college or university that has an available scholarship for him or her.
TFB is currently in its second year of activities, establishing itself due to a strategic alliance with ABE League (Association that organizes collegiate basketball in Mexico). In its first year, TFB successfully linked 10 student/athletes to universities or colleges, all because of the exposure generated at TFB main event, Elite Camp.
In our campaign we want to unite the basketball community of Mexico, that all differences between players, teams, coaches and leagues can be put aside once and for all, so that everyone is convinced that TFB is a beneficial program for sports around the nation.
Your contributions will aid us to give the program a big push towards becoming the one and only recruiting system in the nation, assuring that hundreds of prospects can have a window to show their talents to the eyes of scouts and college basketball coaches.
We firmly believe that this will cause 2 positive effects on basketball; a stronger and better collegiate competition that later will fortify the profesional league and national team. The second positive effect has to do with better college education brought to student/athletes, that later will reflect on better and stronger profesionals in all walks of life.   WHAT WE NEED AND WHAT YOU GET.
Our goal is to reach 10K dollars (around 175K mexican pesos). So far TFB has been kept afloat due to the effort of a small staff and their economic posibilities; in order to continue we look forward to have the support of our community. There are 3 needs that are going to be satisfied with the contributions made here.
Creation and maintenance of an online platform. This platform will allow an easy interaction between all basketball related actors. It will became a network where the communication among individuals and institutions will be possible.
A well developed Elite Camp, event where the top recruits will show their talent, with the goal of becoming a student/athlete in one of the many universities that are looking for talented young people.
A full scale tour of evaluation camps around the nation, in what will be the first stage of our third year. We will be looking to reach new locations but also locations where the opportunities are most needed.
Our perks are designed for those that loves basketball as much as we do.
Beyond our eternal thankfulness, those who contributes to our cause will receive something basketball related, from a TFB official kit to Elite Camp tickets, there are many options. Since early stages of the campaign planning we have been blessed with the support of brands such as Spalding Mexico, 143buzzgame and a few professional basketball players and design artists, all of whom have contributed with official merch so we can reward our community.
If the goal is not reached, the contributions raised will nonetheless help us and will be destined to the creation of our platform and materialization of our Elite Camp. THE IMPACT
TFB is a perfect example of the spirit of overcoming that characterizes mexican basketball. Helping us will cause:
-A never-seen-before united basketball community in Mexico under one project, which is beneficial exclusively to the sportsman and sportsmanship.
- An unprecedented sports scouting structure in our nation.
-More and better athletes that will gain exposure so they can show their talents to college coaches and scouts.
-An efficient scouting for colleges and universities at a low cost.
- TFB to reach a complete coverage and census of the national basketball youth talent. RISKS AND CHALLENGES
We are aware that when we conclude the campaign we will be fortified, however our battle will not be completed.
As we are doing this crowdfunding campaign we are also taking measures to secure that our program will thrive.
Establishing a NGO is our first step towards economic strength for our program.
The implementation of an ambitious marketing plan is near. With it, we will attract national attention of sponsors within the private enterprise.
Diversification of TFB is in development as we speak, wheter in other levels of basketball or other sports. OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP

<h3>Meet Charles</h3>
<p>Charles hails from a remote fishing village a day's journey from Ghana's capital, but left at a young age in hopes of going to school. Charles had the chance to study with teachers from around the globe, igniting his passion for learning, and for sharing the wisdom and cultures of West Africa with the world.  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1526152834/dtjadxw4ciosjt4yhsyt.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>By the time he entered high school, Charles was committed to bringing educational opportunities to other kids like him.  He mobilized friends and neighbors to establish a library in a remote town near his family's home.  Then, he worked with a student visiting from China to electrify the library with solar power.</p>
<h3>Charles Dreams Big in the Face Obstacles</h3>
<p>After completing high school, Charles set his sights on college.  With hard work, and a little luck, he was accepted to a top U.S. university to study sustainable design and construction management.</p>
<p>But then, his visa was denied. Never one to be defeated, Charles vowed, if he couldn’t go to college, he would bring college to Ghana.</p>
<p>Charles is working to pursue this dream with Ben, a strategy consultant, former Dartmouth admissions officer, and international education NGO director.</p>
<p>To know Charles is to believe in Charles - he has the power to change the lives of others in his community, country, and the globe.</p>
<h3>Constructing a Sustainable Education &amp; Retreat Center</h3>
<p>Now we’re building a sustainable education center and retreat in the scenic mountains of West Africa, nestled below a waterfall in the heart of a wildlife sanctuary. Charles and dozens of community members have been developing new skills as they learn-by-doing under the mentorship of experts from Ghana, the US, and Canada. </p>

</div><div>
<p>This project, though not yet complete, is already changing lives. Charles has helped local workers save and invest in family businesses, send their daughters to school, and pay for long-deferred medical care. Upon completion of construction, the center will be home to an intimate retreat only during the cool summer months.</p>
<p>The rest of the year will host educational programs to support health, literacy, skills training, entrepreneurship, the arts, and more. We dream that the physical space we are building becomes an incubator for global ideas, driven by the talent of the region.</p>

</div> <p>Thanks for your consideration!<br/>Ian Freeman<br/>Program Director, LRN.FM</p></div>","LRN.FM is the best liberty-oriented audio streamed 24/7 online and via satellite, for free.  Our current satellite coverage includes North America, Central America, and Sub-Saharan Africa.  Anyone with a cheap dish and receiver can receive LRN.FM and the ideas of freedom.
We'd like to expand that to include the rest of the globe. 
In many parts of the world, cable TV installations are non-existent or uncommon due to their high up-front and ongoing cost.  Satellite is the most common form of audio/video entertainment in these areas.  It's common for homes to already have the Ku-band dish and ""Free-to-Air"" receiver.  For many of the 4 billion people in the world who have no internet (over 50% of the world's population), Free-to-Air is a lifeline to the world, uncensored by the state.
Free-to-Air means that no subscription is needed to receive the channels.  They are TV or radio channels broadcast ""in-the-clear"", direct-to-home.  Some satellites, like Galaxy 19 over North and Central America (where LRN.FM has been heard since 2009) have hundreds of Free-to-Air channels.

Who is listening?

Meet Ako.

Ako lives in Cameroon, Africa, where LRN.FM has been available on satellite since 2012.  He says everyone has Ku-band dishes in Cameroon.  He has personally introduced at least two hundred of his friends to our programs and says they listen and meet regularly to discuss the topics they hear on LRN.FM.  You can listen to one of our interviews with Ako here.

<p>BrainWare
SAFARI has already helped tens of thousands of students, as well as many adults, build
their cognitive skills.<span>  And now we’re
ready to take it to the next level.  We plan to release the newest version of BrainWare in Fall of 2015.</span></p>
<p><b>What are cognitive skills?</b><span> 
Cognitive skills are the processes the brain uses to take in,
understand, manipulate, store and retrieve information from the outside
world.  They include processes like
sustained or divided attention, short-term or working memory, visual span or
visualization, as well as auditory, sensory integration and other skills.  BrainWare SAFARI develops 41 cognitive skills
in all, making it the most comprehensive program of its kind<a href=""http://www.mybrainware.com/safari/cognitive-skills"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>.  More information on cognitive skills.</u></a></span></p>
<p><b>What makes BrainWare SAFARI different?</b><span> 
Besides being comprehensive, it develops skills in a highly integrated
way, like cross-training for your brain. 
That makes it effective and creates sustainable improvements in cognitive
functioning that transfer to academic performance and everyday life.  Another big difference – BrainWare SAFARI
uses the best practices of video-game technology to make the program engaging –
a key to getting great results. </span></p>
<p><b>How well does the program work?</b><span> 
When BrainWare SAFARI is used according to the recommended protocol (3
to 5 times per week, 30 to 60 minutes per session, for 10 to 14 weeks), it has been shown
to increase cognitive skills dramatically, in peer-reviewed published research
and field studies.  In published
research, students improved their cognitive ability by over 4 years and their
academic ability by almost 2 years in 12 weeks.

<p><b>What’s next?</b><span> 
The next stage for BrainWare SAFARI means new technology to make it
completely web-based so it can be used on any computer, tablet or mobile
device.  It also means a new set of

The
Ely Folk School (EFS) wants to build community by providing learning experiences that celebrate the wilderness heritage, art, history, culture, and craft of the people of northern Minnesota. Located in the town of Ely,
Minnesota, at the edge of the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness, EFS will
showcase the skills and talents of local artists and craftspeople. Folk Schools are designed to create community
 in a hands-on, experiential learning environment.  We have the property lease, and are working on the schedule of classes, so it's REALLY HAPPENING!
What We
Need & What You Get
Our start-up costs include utilities, lights, furniture, teaching supplies, cleaning supplies, etc. Money raised by donations will be helpful in grant applications that require community involvement and matching funds.  You will receive the satisfaction of knowing you invested in a community of teachers and learners that many people will benefit from in future! Thank you. 
The Impact
The establishment of an excited learning community on the main street will help strengthen the local economy of Ely.  An
investment in EFS is an investment in rural America, an investment in
community.

their kids to <b>live more fully in the love of Christ</b>? What if you could hand all those parents books and digital resources that made it easy for them to <b>pray, celebrate grace, love God and neighbor, and talk about God</b> with their kids? What if you could give all those kids <b>beautifully crafted storybooks</b> that told great stories of faith?<b><br/></b><b><br/></b>Team up with Peanut Butter &amp; Grace, and we'll do all that and more by the end of the year.<b> <br/><br/></b><h2>
<b>Making Family Faith
Formation As Simple as a PB &amp; J</b>
</h2><p>The research is unambiguous: The way that parents live out
the faith at home is far and away the number one predictor of kids’ future
faith practices. And yet, <b>even among parents who say that passing the faith on
to their kids is “very important,” as few as 30 percent actually do anything at
home to meet that goal.</b> (<a href=""http://www.pbgrace.com/family-faith-facts/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.pbgrace.com/why-home-based-family-faith-formation-matters/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">See more about the importance of family-based faith formation</a><u>.</u>)</p>
<p>What can we do to support these parents? We can give them resources
that make it super simple to start
living out the faith with their kids, right here and right now.</p>
<p>That’s what Peanut Butter &amp; Grace books and digital
resources are created to do. They’re:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b><span>Practical</span></b>: Rather than asking parents to
“teach” their kids “about” a faith that they might not know too well
themselves, Peanut Butter &amp; Grace coaches parents toward practicing the faith with their kids in everyday life and using that experience as a starting point for learning more about why we do what we do as Catholic Christians.</li>
<li>
<b>Grab-and-go</b>: Instead of super-complicated lesson
plans, parents get started practicing the faith with their kids right away.<br/>
</li>
<li>
<span><span></span></span><b>Focused</b>: Families focus on the essentials of following Christ in the company of the whole Church.</li>
</ul>
<h4 align=""center""><b>The bottom line:
Family faith formation should be as simple<br/>as making a pb &amp; j sandwich.</b></h4>

<p>Together, we can help 10,000 Catholic families start
practicing the faith at home by getting these books and digital resources into the
hands of parents. Here’s how funding from this IndieGoGo campaign will make it
possible to reach that goal by March 2016:</p>
<p><b>1. Making books and resources</b><br/>About $6,000 will go toward paying for images and artwork,
manuscript development and editing, and miscellaneous fees and expenses
directly tied to making books (e.g., imprimatur and ISBN fees, print set-up
fees, and so on).</p>
<p><b>2. Mailing sample books to people who can spread the word</b><br/>About $2,500 will pay for the cost of mailing sample copies
of books to 350 people who can spread the word: bookstore owners, top Catholic
bloggers, and key Church leaders at the parish, diocesan, and national levels.</p>
<p><b>3. Going viral</b><br/>Online advertising is both affordable and easy to target to
relevant audiences. $1,500 will help us reach our goal of 5,000 “likes” on our
Facebook page and 1,500 subscriptions to The Bread within one year.</p>
<p><b></b></p><br/><h2><b>Let’s do even more:
Our “stretch” goals</b></h2>
<p>There are about 1.5 million Catholic families in our target audience, which is good motivation to go above and beyond our campaign goal. Here's what else we'd like to do:</p>
<p><b>4. Get even more sample books out</b><br/>Sample books fuel word of mouth and get resources to
families right away. Raising $2,500 more than our campaign goal will help us send
out another 350 books to people who can spread the word.</p>
<p><b>5. Network at conferences</b><br/>Let’s network and get the word out by attending key
conferences, including the World Meeting of Families in Philadelphia
(September) and the National Catholic Youth Conference in Indianapolis (November).
$1,200 will get us to these conferences, which will undoubtedly spark ideas for
new ways to help Catholic families do the faith with kids at home. </p>
<p><b>6. Acquire artwork for more children’s picture books</b><br/>Storytelling is one of the key ways that parents and
grandparents pass the faith on to kids, which is why we’d like to follow up <i>The Little Flower</i> with another picture
book by CBN producer Audra Haney, <i>Look
with Your Heart</i>. $2,500 acquires the art we need to jumpstart this project.</p>

their kids to live more fully in the love of Christ? What if you could hand all those parents books and digital resources that made it easy for them to pray, celebrate grace, love God and neighbor, and talk about God with their kids? What if you could give all those kids beautifully crafted storybooks that told great stories of faith?Team up with Peanut Butter & Grace, and we'll do all that and more by the end of the year. 
Making Family Faith
Formation As Simple as a PB & J
The research is unambiguous: The way that parents live out
the faith at home is far and away the number one predictor of kids’ future
faith practices. And yet, even among parents who say that passing the faith on
to their kids is “very important,” as few as 30 percent actually do anything at
home to meet that goal. (See more about the importance of family-based faith formation.)
What can we do to support these parents? We can give them resources
that make it super simple to start
living out the faith with their kids, right here and right now.
That’s what Peanut Butter & Grace books and digital
resources are created to do. They’re:


Practical: Rather than asking parents to
“teach” their kids “about” a faith that they might not know too well
themselves, Peanut Butter & Grace coaches parents toward practicing the faith with their kids in everyday life and using that experience as a starting point for learning more about why we do what we do as Catholic Christians.

Grab-and-go: Instead of super-complicated lesson
plans, parents get started practicing the faith with their kids right away.


Focused: Families focus on the essentials of following Christ in the company of the whole Church.

The bottom line:
Family faith formation should be as simpleas making a pb & j sandwich.
Here’s what we’ve
already accomplished
We’ve already done a lot since launching on January 1. The
numbers tell the story:

4,800: The number of individuals who have visited our
website, pbgrace.com.

800: The number of people who have “liked” our
Facebook page.



150: The number of people subscribing to The
Bread, our weekly family faith formation newsletter.

3: The number of books we’ve published.

All of these efforts have generated a warm and enthusiastic
response (just look at the testimonials in the “Why People Love Peanut Butter
& Grace” section below).
Here’s a rundown of the resources we’ve already created:

77 Ways to Pray with
Your Kids: A Guide for Catholic FamiliesSeventy-seven super-short articles introduce parents to
the many different ways that Catholics pray, explaining how to practice each way
with kids of different ages. (See full description)The BreadThe Bread is a weekly family faith formation planner that
helps families connect to the feasts, events, and Sunday Scripture readings for
the upcoming week. It’s posted to the pbgrace.com website and e-mailed to
subscribers every Friday. (See The Bread)The Illuminated
Rosary: The Joyful MysteriesThe books in the Illuminated Rosary series help families
pray the rosary together by giving kids more than sixty works of sacred art to
meditate on—one for each Hail Mary and Our Father of the rosary. The Joyful Mysteries is the first book
in the series. (See full description)

The Illuminated Rosary: The Sorrowful MysteriesThe Sorrowful Mysteries is the second book in the Illuminated Rosary series. (See full description)What we’d like to do
With your help, we’d like to do even more for Catholic
families in the coming year by creating these new resources:
Raising Catholic Kids:
Your Guide to Talking about God, Celebrating Grace, Doing Good, and Praying
with Your Kids (working title)This is every parent’s must-have sourcebook for how to
implement the whole range of core Catholic practices with kids of all ages.
A Catholic Family
Hearthbook: A Treasury of Foods, Stories, and Traditions Celebrating Catholic Holy
Days throughout the Year (working title)Traditions, stories, and meal plans for celebrating the
major feasts of the Church year, with full color photos throughout.
The Bread 2.0The Bread, but revamped with input from parish family life
ministers and made available as a PDF for downloading and photocopied
distribution.
The Little Flower: A
Parable of St. Thérèse of LisieuxEven little people can do great things for God, as the young
Thérèse Martin discovers in this children’s picture book. (See full description)The Ultimate Catholic
Bucket List, Teen Edition: 101 Things Every Catholic Teen Should Try Before
They Die, or Turn Twenty (Whichever Comes First)This book offers teens a wide variety of core Catholic
practices for teens to “try out,” either on their own or in a friendly
competition with classmates using the point system included in the book.
The Illuminated
Rosary: The Glorious MysteriesThe Glorious Mysteries
is the third book in the Illuminated Rosary series.
The Illuminated
Rosary: The Luminous MysteriesThe Luminous Mysteries
is the fourth book in the Illuminated Rosary series.
Wit, Wisdom, & Wet
Wipes: Musings on Parenthood by Catholic Bloggers (working title)Practical advice, insightful personal reflections, and humor
from the top Catholic parenting blogs.Look with Your HeartA children's picture book about looking for God's presence in all things, even when He seems far away. Written by Christian Broadcast Network writer and producer Audra Haney and illustrated by Tracey Arvidson.
Join us in reaching
10,000 Catholic families

Together, we can help 10,000 Catholic families start
practicing the faith at home by getting these books and digital resources into the
hands of parents. Here’s how funding from this IndieGoGo campaign will make it
possible to reach that goal by March 2016:
1. Making books and resourcesAbout $6,000 will go toward paying for images and artwork,
manuscript development and editing, and miscellaneous fees and expenses
directly tied to making books (e.g., imprimatur and ISBN fees, print set-up
fees, and so on).
2. Mailing sample books to people who can spread the wordAbout $2,500 will pay for the cost of mailing sample copies
of books to 350 people who can spread the word: bookstore owners, top Catholic
bloggers, and key Church leaders at the parish, diocesan, and national levels.
3. Going viralOnline advertising is both affordable and easy to target to
relevant audiences. $1,500 will help us reach our goal of 5,000 “likes” on our
Facebook page and 1,500 subscriptions to The Bread within one year.
Let’s do even more:
Our “stretch” goals
There are about 1.5 million Catholic families in our target audience, which is good motivation to go above and beyond our campaign goal. Here's what else we'd like to do:
4. Get even more sample books outSample books fuel word of mouth and get resources to
families right away. Raising $2,500 more than our campaign goal will help us send
out another 350 books to people who can spread the word.
5. Network at conferencesLet’s network and get the word out by attending key
conferences, including the World Meeting of Families in Philadelphia
(September) and the National Catholic Youth Conference in Indianapolis (November).
$1,200 will get us to these conferences, which will undoubtedly spark ideas for
new ways to help Catholic families do the faith with kids at home. 
6. Acquire artwork for more children’s picture booksStorytelling is one of the key ways that parents and
grandparents pass the faith on to kids, which is why we’d like to follow up The Little Flower with another picture
book by CBN producer Audra Haney, Look
with Your Heart. $2,500 acquires the art we need to jumpstart this project.

About 77 Ways to Pray with Your Kids:
I am having fun with
this book [77 Ways to Pray with Your Kids], lots of great ideas on bringing

me all kinds of ideas on better catechizing the whole family. A must for Catholic
families who want more than a Sunday Faith.—Debra Ann Matchell
It’s not easy to be a
Christian parent, and it’s not easy to pray. 77 Ways to Pray with Your Kids
cuts straight to the most important aspects of these challenges, offering
wisdom, humor, and a treasury of ideas.  —Sarah Reinhard,
author of Catholic Family Fun and blogger at SnoringScholar.com (Read Sarah's review in National Catholic Register)

<h3>About cerebral palsy</h3>

<p>It is a very exciting time for children with CP and their families. In some areas, research has moved beyond investigation of effective therapies. We know what works. Therapy needs to happen very early (in infancy) and therapy needs to be intensive. This means that toys and home-based programs undertaken by parents are an essential part of any therapy program. However, effective therapy is much more than simply “playing with toys”. In order to acquire new skills and learn, activities must be carefully matched to a child's goals, individual ability level and age.

</div><br/></div>","Short SummaryWhy the Idea

We want to create quality educational contents and facilitate the learning process. Our goal is to combine learning with having fun and so contribute to improve the learning techniques used in schools today. We use technology as a learning tool, because children learn best when they play, plus they love technology.
With our teaching experience, we create quality content suited to the individual development of each child.

With our games, we display the contents to the child in a simple and attractive way, improving the teaching methods used in schools.
Our inspiration are our children, we watch them play games, and we want to make quality games for all the children.
Game Description
Princesses for preschool is a project of  ITSimples Games where we create educational preschool video games for girls.

Princesses for preschool has features that will amaze every preschool girl from 3 to 6 years old. 
It has magic, princesses, fairies, among other amazing elements that are there to inspire the child's creativity and imagination.
We approach educational themes, such as letters, numbers, nature, healthy food choices, colors, music, sequences, among others,  in a simple and attractive way, with the main purpose to give the child a great time while learning at the same time. 
The Princesses for preschool game pack will be available on English, German and Portuguese.
The child gets rewarded for playing
For every learning game the child plays, she will receive hearts, that are the exchange coin in the game. 
She can exchange in-game earned hearts for dress-up items in the dress-up game. 
The child needs to play the learning games, in order to obtain her own hearts. 
It is not possible to buy hearts with money, because we think this is a bad practice in a learning game for children and the child needs to struggle and earn her own hearts.

Hungary is a non-profit, public-private partnership with the Government of Hungary. Participants also contribute a self-pay portion of $1,300. To

Their common
link: Hungarian ancestry!



Scratch
the surface of an American, and you'll quickly find the Hungarian connection—at
most two degrees of separation. Hungarians have contributed to practically
every thread in the fabric of America. The Hungarian community in the U.S. is
nearly as old as the country itself and numbers 1.5 million.


ReConnect
Hungary is a unique cultural, educational and social immersion program for
young adults aged 18–26 of Hungarian
heritage, born in the U.S. or Canada. The birthright experience sets these young
Hungarian Americans on a lifetime journey of understanding their heritage,
connecting to each other and the global Hungarian community, fostering their
traditions, and giving back to their home communities.

Every
summer, a group of individually selected young adults begins a two-week journey
of self-discovery to learn about their Hungarian roots in a totally different
and new way.The program has been a
continuous success since its launch
in 2012. To date, 36 participants took part in the
program, which has become so popular that last year we had to waitlist
19 applicants until Summer 2015, since the
group size is limited and funds for a second trip were lacking.


Reconnecting American youth to their Hungarian roots is our
mission. Make it yours!

We
hope that with your generous support we will be able to expand the program and fulfill these
deserving young people’s dream of discovering their Hungarian self! 


What We Need 

ReConnect
Hungary is a non-profit, public-private partnership with the Government of Hungary. Participants also contribute a self-pay portion of $1,300. To
enhance the “private” part of the partnership, we need more supporters for this
unique program! Current funding only allows us to provide this birthright trip to one group of 15 individuals.  
As interest is high, our
goal is to raise enough to fund a second trip in 2015, the cost of which is $35,000. We don't want to turn away any deserving candidate!
The
total value of the trip is $4,800 per participant, which covers basically
everything—all accommodations, meals, transportation,
entrance fees, and the pre-trip online orientation package. 
If we meet our goal, a second group of lucky young adults will get to delve deeper into the treasures of their ancestral land. But even if we fall short, every dollar raised will be used toward growing and improving the program! 


How You Can Help


A gift of any size makes a difference. Every $5,000 we raise means that another young American or Canadian will have the chance to participate in this life-changing experience!  


Donate $10 to cover one participant’s experience of preparing an open-air meal
from start to finish at the groundbreaking biofarm in Zsámbok.




Donate $25 and cover admission for 2 participants to the Széchenyi Thermal Baths,
the largest outdoor medicinal bath in Europe since 1913.




Donate $50 and cover admission for 7 participants to the House of Terror—named one
of the most powerful museums in Europe by Rick Steves, and the only museum in
the world devoted to the victims of both fascism and communism.



Donate $100 and cover admission for a group of 15 to
the Hospital in the Rock—a fully equipped and intact secret underground
hospital from WWII hidden among six miles of caves and tunnels under Buda’s
Castle Hill.



Donate $250 and cover the group’s one-day visit to the
artist colony of Szentendre and the Skanzen Open Air Museum or Ópusztaszer Heritage Park, where the
participants engage in various folk craft workshops.




Donate $500 and cover all meals for one participant for
2 weeks.





Donate $1,000 and cover the group’s one-day visit (incl.
transportation, meals and accommodations) to a Hungarian minority community
across the border in Slovakia, Serbia or Croatia.






Donate $5,000 and cover the entire group’s
accommodations at City Hostel Budapest for 2 weeks.



Donors
contributing $1,000 or more will get a chance to participate in the Welcome Dinner at the General Consulate
of Hungary in New York on June 29, 2015, where they can personally
meet all the participants and the organizers of the
program.

<p>Hello!  My name is Marlene Resnick Simons, and I am a children's author, educator, and parenting coach out of sunny Sarasota, Florida.  I am beginning a campaign to launch my series of children's books, and I need your help to realize this goal!<br/></p>
<p>""Thea Dorable's Adventures"" is a series of short books and companion videos that engage and empower<span> children in making  healthier choices and better protecting
themselves in a variety of situations, from using seat
belts to dealing with conflicts. Providing immediately</span><span> usable information results
in new competencies for children. This engenders an excitement about learning
to read, as well as sharing their newly learned skills.</span></p>
<p>The series includes short
books and companion animations that range in time from 60 - 90 seconds. They are
narrated by Thea Dorable... who is not your ordinary teddy bear!</p>
<p>Thea Dorable provides a broad range of health and safety
information orally, visually and with subtitles, which promote early literacy
and helps children, who are speakers of other languages learn English.

<p>Three of these books have been piloted in a Head Start
Reading Program, with parents reading to their children. They were also piloted
with first grade students, who after learning the rhyming text brought the
books home to share with their families. In a school with 92% of children on
the free or reduced lunch program and 60% in families where English was the
second language, the children dramatically increased the use of seat belts for
themselves, their teenaged siblings and their parents. In addition, children
talked about the importance of healthy eating and exercise.</p>
<p>The point of view is that children are powerful catalysts in
the arena of learning and in disseminating their knowledge and skills to family

""Thea Dorable's Adventures"" is a series of short books and companion videos that engage and empower children in making  healthier choices and better protecting
themselves in a variety of situations, from using seat
belts to dealing with conflicts. Providing immediately usable information results
in new competencies for children. This engenders an excitement about learning
to read, as well as sharing their newly learned skills.
The series includes short
books and companion animations that range in time from 60 - 90 seconds. They are
narrated by Thea Dorable... who is not your ordinary teddy bear!
Thea Dorable provides a broad range of health and safety
information orally, visually and with subtitles, which promote early literacy
and helps children, who are speakers of other languages learn English.

skill deficits of struggling readers.” Readingrockets.org,

Titles
and Topics (Age Range 2
– 8):
1.  What
About Lunch?:  Healthy eating and exercise
2.  Riding
in Cars:  Using
seat belts
3.  The
Little Chicken That Could:  Self-esteem and the importance of learning 

4.  My
First Day of School:  Resolving conflicts/Dealing with bullying
5.  Learning
to Swim: Water
safety for children
6.  Some
Little Children Have Asthma:  Helping
children to understand the challenges of the condition
7.  Gardens
Grow: Growing and appreciating gardening 

8.  When I
Get Big: Learning about the importance of rules
9.  A
Vegetable’s Journey: Where
food comes from
10.  A Day
in an Apple Tree:
Identifying poison ivy oak and sumac
11.  The
Little Girl Who Couldn’t
Sit Still:  Re-framing the issue of ADHD
12.  When I
was Three: Learning
and growing
Three of these books have been piloted in a Head Start
Reading Program, with parents reading to their children. They were also piloted
with first grade students, who after learning the rhyming text brought the
books home to share with their families. In a school with 92% of children on
the free or reduced lunch program and 60% in families where English was the
second language, the children dramatically increased the use of seat belts for
themselves, their teenaged siblings and their parents. In addition, children
talked about the importance of healthy eating and exercise.
The point of view is that children are powerful catalysts in
the arena of learning and in disseminating their knowledge and skills to family
members and friends.

WHY THIS PROJECT?
This project grew out of a concern for so many children, who with a bit of information and some skills, can dramatically improve their health, safety and survival in a broad variety of situations.
These books are supported by companion videos of 90 seconds each, which reinforce the books, as well as promote literacy. The books are short, beautifully illustrated and rhyme. They are perfect for classroom learning where children become familiar with the text and then bring the books home to share with family members.
The results of a pilot study, in one community, using the book “Riding In Cars” follows. How many lives were saved? How many injuries were prevented?

<p><b>ABOUT THIS PROJECT</b></p>
<p>The SmartPlan<sup>TM</sup>  systematic approach has
been field tested over a three year period and the results have been phenomenal.  </p>
<p>Working with
communities, we provide a Free One Hour College Planning Workshop to parents of
high school students at community centers, schools, and other public
(non-commercial) meeting areas.  At these
workshops, they receive valuable information about the internal workings of
each of the college systems – Selection, Applications, Financial Aid,
Evaluation, and Awards.  </p>
<p>As part of our agreement
with communities, each workshop participant is also invited to participate in a Free One Hour Private Consultation with a Senior College Planning Advisor (a
$175 value) to discuss their specific family challenges, needs, and overall situation.  In the private consultation, the also receive
additional specific knowledge, a preliminary estimate of their Expected Family Contribution (EFC) to their student's education, and a basic road map (GPS) as to what they need to
do to maximize their probability of success within each system.  </p>
<p>At this point, <b>parents are
empowered and have the knowledge to manage the systems on their own if they
choose to do so</b>.  They can also request
assistance from CFA if appropriate (<b>no obligation</b>) to help them with some or
all of the challenges that they will encounter in support of their goals. Some of the typical reasons why parents
request assistance are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Time Available - With everything going on their life, parents don't have time to study &amp; learn nuances, focus their attention, and/or implement a
strategy - Parents both working and students in activities (especially single
Moms);</p></li>
<li><p>Late Start, Time Crunch – Student is a senior in high school
and college planning process just beginning to be a priority for parents;<br/></p></li>
<li><p>Overwhelming – Parents overwhelmed already and fear of failing their children; and/or,</p></li>
<li>Parents or child think that there is no hope of getting a post-high school education.<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p>CFA offers a number of
support services packages at affordable rates that can assist the parents and
further improve the parents and students chances of success throughout all four
years of college beginning as early as the student’s high school freshmen year
and lasting through the four years of college. 
Siblings are automatically eligible to receive a substantial discount
for the same services.</p>
<p>If required, CFA can
also act as their authorized agent in managing every aspect of the entire
college process and provide personal coaching to the students and the parents.  </p>
<p>It should be noted that
everything that CFA does can also be directly applied to adults who want to
start or just finish their college degree and also for those who have a degree
but want to continue to expand the credentials with at the graduate level
including medical school, etc. </p>
<p>The demand for this
valuable information and support is growing exponentially as more parents are
seeking answers and a pathway forward.  This
project is designed to take this CFA SmartPlan<sup>TM</sup> system to the next
level to satisfy that demand.  </p>
<p>By reaching more
families and students and empowering them with both knowledge and support that
they may need to confront the challenges imposed by the college systems, we know
that we can have a significant positive impact on their lives and help them
avoid unnecessary debt. </p>
<p>For students of all ages, it
can be the difference between getting a college education and being saddled
with debt for 10 - 20 years <b><u>OR</u></b>
getting into the college that they want and graduating with the minimum manageable
student loans.  </p>
<p><b>For parents and students - it is <i>Peace of Mind</i>!</b></p>
<p>Funding from this
project will be used to expand the reach of the CFA SmartPlan<sup>TM</sup> program to be inclusive of
parents and students of all ages across the entire country.  It will include two primary areas of focus:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Expand the number of in-person local community
workshops and support structure to support that demand; and,</p></li>
<li><p>Implement a secure mirrored duplication of the
in-person workshops and private consultations that are facilitated on-line by a
CFA Professional Advisor.  </p></li>
</ol>
<p>This is will allow us to
reach out to more people In a shorter period of time and make it more
inclusive, especially for those who live in rural areas of the country.</p>
<p>We know that we
can make positive contributions to solving the challenges that prospective
students and their parents face in the college systems. We believe that if we
can help more people have the opportunity to get a college education, they will
be empowered to not only pursue their dreams and career path but, as a result,
they will be empowered and capable to solve society’s challenges social, economic,
and environmental challenges for the greater good.  Perhaps one of these aspiring students will
find the cure for cancer, develop a viable plan to solve poverty issues, solve complex environmental issues, or create a magnificent piece of music or art.<br/></p>
<p><b>We welcome your support to empower parents and students so they take charge of their future.</b></p>

journey.  The clock is ticking not only
for this campaign but for the futures of many!

<p><br/></p><p>3. Potential Risk (very low) – US Government pays for college education

There is a global gap in education technology. Not all children are privileged enough to have a meaningful education. We want to bridge the gap and give these students the opportunity to receive the new global standard of education.We believe that every boy and girl is entitled to a bright future and should not be hindered by the educational resources.  In places like the Democratic Republic of Congo, youth do not receive any practical computer training necessary to be competitive in the global economy. With the help of the Indiegogo community we want to give these children the future they deserve.




Our PlanThrough the development of an Educational Technology Centre (ETC), Nyantende Foundation will enhance the accessibility of computers and the Internet for the upper-level students it enrolls at local secondary schools in eastern DR Congo. The goal is to offer an extra-curricular, after-school program where students attain the vital technological skills their current education system cannot afford to provide them with. By teaching its sponsored students how, for example, to use word processing software, make excel sheets and navigate the Internet, Nyantende Foundation is providing students with some additional skills required to succeed in the modern, global economy.The Educational Technology Centre Why build an Educational Technology Centre? In order to be competitive and informed in a technology driven, society, all Congolese students deserve basic computer literacy training.

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">My
name is Fabian Heuken. I´m 30 years old and married. Next to Matthias Heuken i´m one of the founders from ONEWORLDINTEGRATION.  I`m an entrepreneur and I
live in Karlsruhe, a city with 300.000 citizens in southern germany.</p>
<h2><b>How did I get the idea:</b></h2>
<p>Whenever
I´m on the way to my office I pass asylum institutions and buildings where
refugees live. I see hopeless and exhausted people in the streets. That makes
me sad.</p>
<p>I´m
mad about the fact that they can`t live like normal people until their asylum wis
approved.</p>
<p>I
visited asylum insitutions and recognized, that those people have no
perspective. They`re sitting arround and can`t do anything. They can`t apply
for a job or visit integration courses until their asylum applications is
approved. This is not acceptable! They want to work and live in europe like
normal people. I want to change this fact! </p>
<p>I
didn`t want to donate charities where only a small amount of money arrives at
those people.</p>

<h2><b>What I bring
up by myself:</b></h2>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">I`m
going to invest all my time in this project. I´m working with my team to
execute all those plans. I support this project with 1.000 euro. </p>
<h2><b>What happens with your money:</b></h2>
<p>We
set up new support centers for refugees in several cities. We`re going to pay
teachers and psychologics. We offer healthy food and take care of those people.

leave their destroyed villages and homes. Those people do not travel by car or

<br/></div>","When
we all speak the same language, integration has been done.
Every day thousands of refugees arrive in germany.
Do
we really help them as soon as the arrive?
ONEWORLDINTEGRATION
supports refugees to get integrated. We help them to learn our language. With
your contribution we offer professional psychological support, language and
integration courses for refugees. These services are free for refugees. What we offer:A perspective for refugees!With your contribution we build support centers in several cities in Germany (depends on the total contribution) and offer following services:- Psychological support:Their journey has been stressful and they experienced worse things. They arrive exhausted and burned out. They have to talk with psychologists about their experiences.- Useful integration courses. Learning by doing!Experience our culture. Learn what western mentality really is all about. Experience democracy and demography and understand how we live.Half day courses with excursion. Full day courses 6 x 45 min and a maximum of 10 participants. Private lessons with 50 min.- None crowded language courses. We offer courses with small groups!Think about yourself: It would be easy for you to learn a new language in a small group. Interactive learning on the computer and specially adapted language courses. Full day courses 6 x 45 min and a maximum of 10 participants. Private lessons with 50 min. Individual lessons for refugees with language weakness.We also try to offer food in those courses.Our goal is to integrate refugees faster than ever! Give them a perspective and a chance to process their experiences. Nothing is worser than being homeless and marginalized.We are in the planning phase until our crowdfunding ends.What you get:







To be honest:
I´m
shocked about the fact that my country has split into two groups: Most of the
population understands that we have to help those people. But more and more
people show their real face: They demonstrate against the admittance of
refugees. Refugee institutions are set on fire. This is not acceptable!
We
can`t sent them back. They`re going to be killed and murdered in their old
country. Their homes have been burnt down. What they had is destroyed forever. All they have is their clothes and smartphones.
In
order to live peacefully together in this country, we need to understand each
other and speak the same language.

We have to give them a voice!


Think about yourself:

What
would you do if there`s war in your country? You`re home is destroyed. Your family
and friends are dead and your children kidnapped.
We
would all escape!
We
would all hope that a country gives us the opportunity to start a new and
peaceful life.
Give
them a chance to speak our language. Give them a voice and let them learn how we
live our western mentality.---
When
we all speak the same language, communicate with each other and respect each
other integration has been done.
ONEWORLDINTEGRATION
can`t support and help all of those refugees. But we can integrate a lot of
people and help them to weather their past.
Help
us to integrate these people in our country and give them the opportunity to
start a new life! We are one world. We are ONEWORLDINTEGRATION! 

About myself:
My
name is Fabian Heuken. I´m 30 years old and married. Next to Matthias Heuken i´m one of the founders from ONEWORLDINTEGRATION.  I`m an entrepreneur and I
live in Karlsruhe, a city with 300.000 citizens in southern germany.
How did I get the idea:
Whenever
I´m on the way to my office I pass asylum institutions and buildings where
refugees live. I see hopeless and exhausted people in the streets. That makes
me sad.
I´m
mad about the fact that they can`t live like normal people until their asylum wis
approved.
I
visited asylum insitutions and recognized, that those people have no
perspective. They`re sitting arround and can`t do anything. They can`t apply
for a job or visit integration courses until their asylum applications is
approved. This is not acceptable! They want to work and live in europe like
normal people. I want to change this fact! 
I
didn`t want to donate charities where only a small amount of money arrives at
those people.

What I bring
up by myself:
I`m
going to invest all my time in this project. I´m working with my team to
execute all those plans. I support this project with 1.000 euro. 
What happens with your money:
We
set up new support centers for refugees in several cities. We`re going to pay
teachers and psychologics. We offer healthy food and take care of those people.

We
offer individual psychological  lessons,
group courses in German and English and group integration courses. These
services are free for the refugees.
What happens if the full amount is
not reached:
We`re
going to start this project in any case and work with all financial resources. If we collect more money, we can help more people. And they need our help!Some facts:

<p>  Driven by a desire to grow a business into a vehicle for creating positive change, Jay's Steak &amp; Hoagie Joint has become much more than just a Cheesesteak Shop. As a business, Jay's Joint provides quality food that's been voted the best in the area  3 years in a row . The owner, Jason Green, has used his business to fuel his desire to improve the local community &amp; provide much more than delicious food for his customers. Donations to local charities &amp; integrating ways to help others is built into their business operations. Now all that Jay has built &amp; the future of his mission is in grave jeopardy.</p>
<p>  <b>One huge obstacle has emerged creating the urgency to get JUP going full force-</b> <b><i>HIS LANDLORD!</i></b></p>
<p>   For years, Jay has struggled with his landlord to get leaks fixed on the roof which have caused expensive damage to his equipment, to repair a pothole-plagued parking lot that deters customers &amp; a laundry list of other property issues that have seriously hurt his business. Despite all this, Jay's Joint has been the most robust business in the shopping center since he bought it over a decade ago. A few months ago, Jay confronted the landlord again about fixing the roof &amp; some other minor property issues. Rather than doing what is right &amp; taking care of the property &amp; it's tenants, the landlord stubbornly lashed out. He told Jay he would refuse to renew his lease in June, 2016.</p>

I am also looking for ""proud partners"" meaning contractors  electricians, plumbers, etc. to help with the build out to try & keep costs down. If  the build comes in under the money raised, all the extra money raised will go directly into ""Helping Us Help Others"". It'll go toward funds for the Food Bank Program & School Supplies Program among many of our other charitable efforts. With a Business model of trying to bring back a sense of community, there's no better name for this than Jay's Unity Project !


   Jay's Unity Project is an initiative to help a local business take the next big step towards achieving their goals. Thus, improving the local community in the process. But we can't do it alone. Help us in Renewing Our Sense of Community and continue our mission of Changing The World, One Cheesesteak At A Time! Please join us to make this dream a reality!    
  Driven by a desire to grow a business into a vehicle for creating positive change, Jay's Steak & Hoagie Joint has become much more than just a Cheesesteak Shop. As a business, Jay's Joint provides quality food that's been voted the best in the area  3 years in a row . The owner, Jason Green, has used his business to fuel his desire to improve the local community & provide much more than delicious food for his customers. Donations to local charities & integrating ways to help others is built into their business operations. Now all that Jay has built & the future of his mission is in grave jeopardy.
  One huge obstacle has emerged creating the urgency to get JUP going full force- HIS LANDLORD!
   For years, Jay has struggled with his landlord to get leaks fixed on the roof which have caused expensive damage to his equipment, to repair a pothole-plagued parking lot that deters customers & a laundry list of other property issues that have seriously hurt his business. Despite all this, Jay's Joint has been the most robust business in the shopping center since he bought it over a decade ago. A few months ago, Jay confronted the landlord again about fixing the roof & some other minor property issues. Rather than doing what is right & taking care of the property & it's tenants, the landlord stubbornly lashed out. He told Jay he would refuse to renew his lease in June, 2016.
  Jay's hands are now tied by a landlord who won't renew his lease. He's facing the nightmare of permanently closing his doors this Summer. Or… somehow finding a way to raise enough money to help  fund a relocation.  EVERYTHING JAY HAS BUILT, ALL OF HIS CHARITABLE EFFORTS IN THE COMMUNITY & THE LIVELIHOOD OF HIS EMPLOYEES ARE CRITICALLY AT RISK!
            After months of back-breaking searches for a new location, Jay has found one that would not only accommodate the business needs but take them to a whole new level. They have only one obstacle- money! The new location is literally 300 yards up the street from his current location enabling him to maintain his existing loyal customer base & continue to grow. But a complete restaurant build out is needed.  The Property has. Sat empty for years but was previously a. wall paper store not a restaurant.  Moving to this new spot is a gateway to Jay's ultimate dream of building a completely self-funded not-for-profit business. Something where all of the profits would  be used to  helping people and businesses  in the local community. Supporting JUP is your way to become part of something bigger than yourself.
  So, we're asking you to help Jay & his staff do what few corporations & businesses care to do: Run a business for the benefit of the community rather than pocketing their profits.
  Jay's Unity Project is not just a campaign to help Jay's Joint relocate, it's a chance to save an indispensable local business!

<br/>THANK YOU</h1><h4>from the deepest of our hearts!</h4></div>","There is a BIG PROBLEM
in our high school educational system today. Over 40% of
students are chronically disengaged from school.



This is a waste of over 6.5 million talented young minds in the United States alone! You can read the news reports and get lost in
the statistics, but a quick conversation with the youths around you will reveal
that the obvious reasons for their lack of interest in school has to do with the
archaic and uninspired model of cramming academic knowledge into their minds. This teaching method doesn't suit humans, who are born to to think outside the box and solve the problems we
face creatively. 
Founder of lean://gap, Eddy Zhong, clearly illustrates the immensity
of this issue in his TED Talk about “How School Makes Kids Less Intelligent.”And he's not the only one, many young leaders expresses the same experiences about the deficiencies of our current high school educational system. If the goal of any society is to grow and educate the next generation of citizens who will be responsible for the well being of the world, then the investments of today should be aimed at the present through believing in the talents in all young people and supporting the growth of that talent by entrusting them to be leaders today.Definition of Entrepreneur: a person who organizes and manages any enterprise, usually with considerable initiative and risk. a Leader.
Truth is, we are ALL entrepreneurs. Since birth, everything we did, every
decision we made, we are taking initiative to understand the world and risking
ourselves all the time to make progress in our lives. Why stop? What happened?
When did life turn into autopilot?
What is lean://gap ?



Eddy is pursuing a mission to empower high school
students to create their own futures, and we students from all over the world
support this vision by committing ourselves to lean://gap, the first and only high school entrepreneurship accelerator in
the world that brings students' ideas to life through an intensive 6-week
summer session. At lean://gap, we'll have the opportunity to work alongside professional engineers, designers,
Harvard & MIT professors, and other successful young entrepreneurs. Just
like the competitions Eddy spoke about in his TED Talk, we will be executing
our ideas by building prototypes and competing against other projects to acquire
funding and launch our start ups. Throughout this intensive learning experience,
we would emerge as battle-hardened veterans with the necessary skills and
resources to confirm, create, test, and build companies that bring valuable
solutions to the world. 
Who are the lean://gap Stars?
Out of the 1000
applicants, and over 200 interviews, lean://gap Stars are the 40 of us chosen to
participate in this revolutionary new concept of HS education. This
program has a lower acceptance rate than Harvard.  We were chosen
because we've demonstrated the entrepreneurial spirit by persevering with our
projects and our vision to better the world despite the lack of support. Each
one of us have many great ideas with immense potential but unable to act upon
these ideas due to the limited resources, connections, and capabilities of our unfavorable
educational environments.

psychodynamics in Australia. Our flagship three year Leadership, Management and

history in Australia and a 65-year history internationally.</p>
<p>We are now entering a <b>new

Since 2010, we have been operating as a small non-profit educational
institute in the field of systems
psychodynamics. Although relatively new, our educational programs, research
and consultancy have grown from a long tradition and practice in systems
psychodynamics in Australia. Our flagship three year Leadership, Management and
Organisation Dynamics (LMOD) program launched in 2014 builds on a 35-year
history in Australia and a 65-year history internationally.
We are now entering a new
stage of growth and development. We have added research and consultancy to
our service offerings. Achieving TEQSA accreditation will enable us to offer
post graduate qualifications, strengthening our position as an alternative
provider of excellence in leadership and management education in Australia.

<div>
<p>This organization exists because the need to empower girls and young women is still very important. While strides have been made to educate and encourage girls to do more and be more, years and years of separation and inequality still exists when it comes to visibility, opportunities, and economic success.  It is important for <b>all of us</b> to continue to promote empowerment and encouragement to girls and young women to create new identities,  forge new paths, and embrace their journey to self- actualization.  The G.I.R.L Project is dedicated to the guidance and wisdom and effort it will take to facilitate this very process.</p>
<img alt=""Mission"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.thegirlproject.me/images/u2679-4.png"" src="""" style=""""/><p>The G.I.R.L. Project is a purposeful effort towards empowering girls to do more and be more in every aspect of their lives, their communities and the world via  personal empowerment, explosive exposure, creative innovation and leadership cultivation.</p>
<p><b>Self-Actualization, a key concept to The G.I.R.L. Project </b>emphasizing the achievement of one's full potential through creativity, independence, spontaneity, and a grasp of  the real world. In order for girls and women to achieve value and equality, it is important to help them self-actualize.</p>
<p><b>Why This Campaign Method??</b></p>
<p>The G.I,R,L, Project is at its infant stage. Some people feel in order to get started doing this hard work and giving girls a place to become more is impossible without the money and non-profit legal status, but the reality is that being teachers, while having resources is invaluable, I and my colleagues are capable to begin the process of shaping futures.  And yet, we want to get this effort started the right way.  I recently directed a middle school initiative, my employer fully funding my idea and praised by the children and parents; the initiative showed so much promise, but my passion needed more room to grow as well as needed to focus on girls as I watched the girls in this program struggle with their confidence among the boys. One girl, an only child, quiet and extremely shy came to me and asked was I really going away, and that she really wanted to be a part of my new girl's project.  Very directly she stated that it cannot cost because her parents could not afford it.  I told her that I would be back for her and the others no matter what...it was determined at that very moment...<b>My organization must exist and must be a non-profit!</b></p>
<p>The impact of this program is going to be huge to the population of the DMV area and their efforts globally. These girls are located in the nation's capital, but are still struggling to maximize their full potential.  There is so much at their disposal, but they need help and encouragement to take advantage. I need to get started now, and honestly I need the funds to begin this effort strong.  Teens have so much access to technology and innovation that beginning this organization with only the resources I can afford would short change the big idea being instituted.  <b>THEY NEED YOUR HELP!</b></p>
<p><b>I need $5000.00 to get the word out, register any girl interested, provide t-shirts for the registration, rent conference and workshop space for our first conference and purchase materials to hold three of the enrichment programs all by October 31, 2015. Please visit the site to get more information: <a href=""http://www.thegirlproject.me"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.thegirlproject.me</a> .</b></p>
<p><b><i>Your contribution helps girls to supplement their education with enrichment programs and experiences that will allow them to think big, dream big and be big.</i></b></p>
<p>I have a lot ahead of me. I am working diligently and extremely hard to prepare work to become a legal non-profit, form curriculum, schedule space, lock in activities and encourage volunteer support to give shape and credibility to this effort, while working full-time, being a om to my teen girl and doing it alone. Recently, I took a self-inventory to evaluate if this was my purpose, and it was confirmed that everything I have done since third grade showed a girl who could innovate, organize, encourage, create, lead strong, delegate with respect, institute first time quality, persevere, and motivate...a skill set for success. I am confident <b>The G.I.R.L. Project</b> can be an asset in the movement for girl change.</p>
<p>Your contribution to The G.I.R.L. Project will free up my money to pay for the non profit registration process which will be greatly appreciated. And, if you love the idea of the The G.I.R.L. Project, I am happy for ideas of free activities, donations of technology and other resources, and would be very appreciative for helping us to get the word out using your mouth and Indiegogo. <b>If you have a heart for a better future for girls, please find it in that heart to support this effort.</b></p>

<p><b>THE STORY:</b>
</p>
<p>Hi Everyone! I am raising money for a school being built in
 Nicaragua. Please read about the project's mission below. If you feel 
it is a worthy cause, I would appreciate a donation! <br/></p>
<p>If I reach $5000 - 100% of which will go to the building fund - I will win a bid to attend the trip and actually be able to participate in building it with
 my own hands. This is something that I've always wanted to do and you 
can help me get there! <br/></p>
<p>I was born and raised in a small town outside Albany, NY. I am a mom of one son and I am currently serving in the NY National Guard as a Blackhawk Helicopter Mechanic. I was in the US Army for 6 years before I joined the National Guard and have deployed twice to the Middle East. This trip is another way for me to give back. I have always wanted to go on a trip of this sort and directly, profoundly and positively impact the lives of people</p>
<p>If you are unable to contribute monetarily, I would appreciate it if you can share with your connections - the more people that know about the campaign, the better chance I have of reaching my goal.<br/></p>
<p>PLEASE read more about the project below and consider a donation - even $10 will help me reach my goal. Thanks for listening! :)<br/>
 </p>
<p>RANDOM ACTS wrote -</p>
<p>In Nicaragua, being born in a rural community often precludes 
access to high school education and all the opportunities in life that 
come with it, especially for women. Many rural families practice 
subsistence farming and do not generate enough income to meet their 
basic needs even excluding education. These and other individuals such 
as women who are pregnant or have children, anyone over 18, and people 
who must work during weekdays are excluded from regular schools.</p>
<p>The Free High School of San Juan del Sur gives these students a chance at secondary education and a better life. In 2012, <a href=""http://www.randomacts.org/news/your-donations-at-work-the-free-high-school-in-san-juan-del-sur-nicaragua/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Random Acts fundraised to help them purchase a bus</a>.
 Now, we are taking on a much bigger dream: a Center for Human 
Development which will serve as a campus for the Free High School. 
Without their own campus, the Free High School students are second class
 citizens in the eyes of the state, their community, and even 
themselves. These older adolescents and adults squeeze themselves into 
elementary school desks and chairs every Saturday, they have very little
 access to a computer lab that’s far away, and they are treated as lower
 class students; the discountable.</p>
<p>It’s time to give these deserving students a beautiful campus of 
their own, complete with a library and a computer lab. Doing so not only
 gives the school a home, but also teaches the students – some for the 
first time in their lives – that they are equal to their peers, and 
valued citizens of the world.</p>
<p>Please join us in turning this dream into reality!</p>
<p>The first 25 people who raise $5,000 between 
now and July 31st, along with one lucky drawing winner, will be able to 
join the Random Acts team on the trip of a lifetime 
to San Juan del Sur this November 20-28. <br/></p>

</div></div>","THE STORY:

Hi Everyone! I am raising money for a school being built in
 Nicaragua. Please read about the project's mission below. If you feel 
it is a worthy cause, I would appreciate a donation! 
If I reach $5000 - 100% of which will go to the building fund - I will win a bid to attend the trip and actually be able to participate in building it with
 my own hands. This is something that I've always wanted to do and you 
can help me get there! 
I was born and raised in a small town outside Albany, NY. I am a mom of one son and I am currently serving in the NY National Guard as a Blackhawk Helicopter Mechanic. I was in the US Army for 6 years before I joined the National Guard and have deployed twice to the Middle East. This trip is another way for me to give back. I have always wanted to go on a trip of this sort and directly, profoundly and positively impact the lives of people
If you are unable to contribute monetarily, I would appreciate it if you can share with your connections - the more people that know about the campaign, the better chance I have of reaching my goal.
PLEASE read more about the project below and consider a donation - even $10 will help me reach my goal. Thanks for listening! :)
 
RANDOM ACTS wrote -
In Nicaragua, being born in a rural community often precludes 
access to high school education and all the opportunities in life that 
come with it, especially for women. Many rural families practice 
subsistence farming and do not generate enough income to meet their 
basic needs even excluding education. These and other individuals such 
as women who are pregnant or have children, anyone over 18, and people 
who must work during weekdays are excluded from regular schools.
The Free High School of San Juan del Sur gives these students a chance at secondary education and a better life. In 2012, Random Acts fundraised to help them purchase a bus.
 Now, we are taking on a much bigger dream: a Center for Human

Walk 9/11 is
a walking trek, covering hundreds of miles, in the footsteps of our Founding Fathers as well as sites which were involved in the
crimes of 9/11.  We plan to embark from Shanksville, PA, then following the Potomac River to our nation's capital in Washington, DC, then from DC we'll walk to the Pentagon 9/11 Memorial in Arlington, VA and then back to DC and on into the historic sites of Baltimore, MD, Philidelphia, PA, Trenton, Morristown, Princeton, and Newark, NJ then on into NYC to the site of 9/11 Museum Memorial at Ground Zero, as well as to the 9/11 Survivor's Tree. *1

Our
mission
~
is
to
investigate
all aspects of the crimes of 9/11, on
film,
in light of the very real fact that since 9/11 no genuine criminal
investigation has taken place. We intend to explore everything...no
taboos! There isn't anything which should be ignored, for this is the
very thing which has kept 9/11 from being properly investigated in
the first place.




Dr. Cornel West and Pamela Senzee in front of the White House after the historic March Against Drones




We
also want to create a
documentary which explores our nation’s founding principles and the
relationship between the current losses of Constitutional freedoms
and the apparent official 9/11
government
fictions.



We
recognize that the
Constitution is a living document
embodying
spiritual
principles and truths which are eternal.
During the walk we intend to explore all aspects of what may be
required to generate and manifest true freedom in our own nation and
inspire its birth and growth in other nations as well.



There
are many subversive, influential forces including financial powers
which endeavor to undermine these divine liberties.  Our goal by
doing the walk and in making our documentary is to bring
light to this dark situation
and expose
the corrupt system so that we as a people can overcome.



Truth
Walk also has another
mission as well, one of transformation.
Our online radio/podcast Quantum Matrix Radio deals
with these serious issues while also focusing on both the science and
the inspiration of that which has the genuine power to change the
paradigm of a post 9/11 world; in this spirit we’ll also explore
what quantum physicists are saying
about changing the world paradigm.

 If
every man, woman and child, regardless of race, color, creed, or
nationality were known to be a powerful spiritual being, how could
the masses be controlled for profit and be duped so easily? Could
it be that the most subversive measures of oppressive and tyrannical
forces are those which obscure our true spiritual nature and self
empowerment? 
We also hope to build a bridge between the peace, Constitutional, and truth movements. We'll interview leaders from both movements and from others, as well as varied experts, professionals, scholars, political leaders, religious leaders, and just people, the people who make up this country and the world.

<p><b>About Karina Carmen Velasco</b></p>
<p>I am a professional
multidisciplinary artist in the genres of dance, music, acting and writing.
Born in Spain of Spanish and Cuban heritage I was raised on the Caribbean
island of Puerto Rico. My childhood was a constant myriad of moves, countries
and changes. Something I had once feared was a liability, would actually become
an enormous asset. Having spent important and significant time and experiences
in the Caribbean, United States, Spain, France, Greece, Cyprus, and Mexico and having traveled extensively, the
gift has been to truly be a citizen of our one World. </p>
<p><b>About the Campaign</b></p>
<p>Through the benefits of this campaign I intend to complete and
publish my first two books for adults and children on the subject of Arts as
the Universal Language of Humanity. As well as to expand on other elevating
benefits of connection, healing, joy and peace through the arts. As a
performance artist, educator and avid musicologist, I have shared my work with countless persons of all ethnic backgrounds and beliefs. Through the gift of
their responses, I have been able to clearly see the undeniable thread of
connection throughout humanity and how the arts provide us a forum for sharing
in our oneness. Furthermore, as a tool for education understanding the
historical journeys of the arts and its creators as well as the implements, such as instruments, provides us with an excellent means to understand the shared experience
of culture and the constant co-creations that occur throughout their journey. As a collaborative experience the arts in all its manifestations
provide us all with a means to express, unite and work
together. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p><span>My goal is to release
both books and continue expanding the dialogue of how to actively implement
arts and share in culture as a tool, not only of beauty and creativity, but of language, self-realization and multicultural understanding. </span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><span>As the project
progresses I would like to develop a documentary film to follow this process.</span></p>
<p>And finally my greatest wish is that all of these projects will culminate in a
foundation that will encourage the awareness of our oneness and the work of unification and understanding through the arts around
the World.  </p>
<p><b>What I Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>In this first phase I
need to have the books, edited, proofed, visually designed, printed and
published. I also need to keep building infrastructure for the project itself.</p>
<p><b>Arts: One Planet, One
Humanity, One Language</b> A
story of the first and shared language of humanity.  Is a book for adults.
A personal journey of experience and awareness as well as archeological, historical and
scientific information that provides a manual for expanding the understanding
of our connection and the multifaceted benefits of arts and culture. </p>
<p><b>You Dance, I Dance, We
All Dance Around the Globe</b>
A children's guide of dance around the World. With a unique surprise that
allows children to hand to each other from country to country a shared dance
implement utilized across the globe, it is both a creative book and an instructional
book. Providing knowledge of the arts, culture and geography with a message
of our connection and combined contributions that create them.</p>
<p>With your investment
you are allowing me the ability to complete the work, finish creative, go
to print and promote the message! </p>
<p>As an investor you are pre buying a copy
of the books and will receive either a copy of the childrens’ book or adult
book or both as preferred. </p>
<p>And please make sure
to visit the perks section where you may contribute by purchasing dance fans, beautiful orginal works of art, photography, or even live musical events! </p>
<p><b>10 % of Funds Donated</b></p>
<p>I will be donating 10%
of the campaign proceeds to organizations providing arts development to under-served
communities and humanitarian aid. Their will be tranpserency about these donations. E-mails will be sent to contributors letting them know when donations are made and exactly where they are made. </p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>Arts and culture are

</div></div>","About Karina Carmen Velasco
I am a professional
multidisciplinary artist in the genres of dance, music, acting and writing.
Born in Spain of Spanish and Cuban heritage I was raised on the Caribbean
island of Puerto Rico. My childhood was a constant myriad of moves, countries
and changes. Something I had once feared was a liability, would actually become
an enormous asset. Having spent important and significant time and experiences
in the Caribbean, United States, Spain, France, Greece, Cyprus, and Mexico and having traveled extensively, the
gift has been to truly be a citizen of our one World. 
About the Campaign
Through the benefits of this campaign I intend to complete and
publish my first two books for adults and children on the subject of Arts as
the Universal Language of Humanity. As well as to expand on other elevating
benefits of connection, healing, joy and peace through the arts. As a
performance artist, educator and avid musicologist, I have shared my work with countless persons of all ethnic backgrounds and beliefs. Through the gift of
their responses, I have been able to clearly see the undeniable thread of
connection throughout humanity and how the arts provide us a forum for sharing
in our oneness. Furthermore, as a tool for education understanding the
historical journeys of the arts and its creators as well as the implements, such as instruments, provides us with an excellent means to understand the shared experience
of culture and the constant co-creations that occur throughout their journey. As a collaborative experience the arts in all its manifestations
provide us all with a means to express, unite and work
together. 


My goal is to release
both books and continue expanding the dialogue of how to actively implement
arts and share in culture as a tool, not only of beauty and creativity, but of language, self-realization and multicultural understanding. 


As the project
progresses I would like to develop a documentary film to follow this process.
And finally my greatest wish is that all of these projects will culminate in a
foundation that will encourage the awareness of our oneness and the work of unification and understanding through the arts around
the World.  
What I Need & What You Get
In this first phase I
need to have the books, edited, proofed, visually designed, printed and
published. I also need to keep building infrastructure for the project itself.
Arts: One Planet, One
Humanity, One Language A
story of the first and shared language of humanity.  Is a book for adults.
A personal journey of experience and awareness as well as archeological, historical and
scientific information that provides a manual for expanding the understanding
of our connection and the multifaceted benefits of arts and culture. 
You Dance, I Dance, We
All Dance Around the Globe
A children's guide of dance around the World. With a unique surprise that
allows children to hand to each other from country to country a shared dance
implement utilized across the globe, it is both a creative book and an instructional
book. Providing knowledge of the arts, culture and geography with a message
of our connection and combined contributions that create them.
With your investment
you are allowing me the ability to complete the work, finish creative, go
to print and promote the message! 
As an investor you are pre buying a copy
of the books and will receive either a copy of the childrens’ book or adult
book or both as preferred. 
And please make sure
to visit the perks section where you may contribute by purchasing dance fans, beautiful orginal works of art, photography, or even live musical events! 
10 % of Funds Donated
I will be donating 10%
of the campaign proceeds to organizations providing arts development to under-served
communities and humanitarian aid. Their will be tranpserency about these donations. E-mails will be sent to contributors letting them know when donations are made and exactly where they are made. 
The Impact
Arts and culture are
our universal language. Beyond the experience we feel as recipients of the
arts, they truly do allow us an avenue to our collectiveness. In areas of
strain and conflict, trauma and loss they provide the least non-threatening
means towards understanding, dialogue, reconciliation and healing. Through my work I have found that they are indispensable to show the globe and humanity as they are, one.
I am a successful
dance company director and producer and have extensive experience working in
development, production, management and promotion.  I have worked as a

Guide, a book sponsored by the LAPCA Foundation Los Angeles and funded by
The Smithsonian. I am a member of the International Dance Council, UNESCO and
have been performing since child hood for about 41 years now and as a
professional for 25 years. 
Risks & Challenges
All ventures face
risks. Whatever the outcome of the campaign, which ever amount is raised the
funds will go towards continuing to move the work and the projects forward and
sharing the message. 
Other Ways You Can Help 
Not everyone can
contribute monetarily. Instead let people know! Enjoy art and
culture. Seek moments where you can experience or create work and share in our
oneness through our shared language. And finally connect with the wonder the
arts provide us. Where else can you deeply find yourself while also being
allowed to lose yourself when necessary!
