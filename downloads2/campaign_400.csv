<p>Hello, my name is Karen Kiester, I currently reside in
Arizona having also lived in California, New Mexico and Oregon.  After having been rather “left brain and math
oriented” I learned to go into a light trace state which “opened” my right
brained, more creative side.  The
information for the book and contemplation card deck, Path of the Sacred
Masculine, came from a “connection” I have with Josef, the Earthly Father of
the Christ while in trace state.  This
connection began in childhood and lay dormant for a number of years to be
reawakened by a mystical experience in 2006.  I feel challenged to go “public” with this information
yet I have been reminded that I am the steward of this information and it is
meant to be shared.   See <a href=""http://pathofthesacredmasculine.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">PathoftheSacredMasculine</a> and <a href=""http://josefspeaks.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">JosefSpeaks</a> for more information.</p><p><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">What is my campaign?</b><br/></p>
<p>My campaign is to raise funds to print the contemplation
card deck.  Currently there are plenty of
card decks on the market but nothing with this theme, nothing that honors the
Sacred Masculine.  The cards were
created by Keith Johnson, an artist from Jacksonville, OR based on key pieces
of information given him regarding each card. 
These cards are meant to be shared and enjoyed as well as be a vehicle
for guidance.  </p>
<p><b>About the card deck</b></p>
<p>The deck is based on a matrix of 9 directions or “suits”
modeled after the 8 major compass points plus the center point. It is then
cross sectioned by categories consisting of archetypes, tools, elements and
realms yielding 36 cards (i.e. 9 directions times 4 categories).  You will find examples of some of the cards
in the gallery. </p>
<p>The cards are to be used in conjunction with the book which
offers descriptions and ways to embody the card and questions for reflection.
The book is aimed towards men, yet women will also find value in its pages and
images for we all have both masculine and feminine energy and tendencies. The
cards are tools to bring balance into one’s life.  The book has a section where Keith describes his
process to create the cards as well as a section where I describe my experience
in receiving this information.  The book
is currently available for purchase in digital or print form on <a href=""http://tinyurl.com/ko4kv5e"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Amazon</a>.   </p>
<p><b>Your contribution</b></p>
<p>Your contribution will help make these cards available for
purchase at the reasonable price of $15.95. 
Unlike a book, which can easily be made available in digital form or
print on demand, the cards require extensive setup and multi-color
printing.  Interestingly, the cost difference
to print 200 decks vs 1,000 decks is minimal.  I need $5,000 to make this happen.  I will use all the money received to print
the card decks.  If my campaign falls
short, I will find a way to make up the difference.  But I don’t think that is going to happen.  </p>
<p><b>Perks!</b></p>
<p>For a $15 contribution, you will receive a personal note of appreciation from me. For a $50 contribution, you will receive a card deck in a
beautiful velvet bag with a personal note of appreciation from me.  For a $100 contribution, you will receive the
$50 contribution items plus a personalized signed copy of the book.  For a $250 contribution, you will receive all
items included in the $100 contribution plus a 30 minute individual session
with myself and Josef.  You may ask any
questions that you desire.  </p>

The recent earthquake in Nepal, with tragic loss of human life, as well as destruction of heritage monuments and art, is a profound example of how important documentation is: before, during, and after disaster strikes. In a race against time, our team of preservation experts is working closely with Buddhist monks and nuns who care for and use sacred art treasures every day in their monasteries. Our approach combines scientific knowledge and techniques, with traditional methods and respect.
With the dramatic and alarming rise in theft from monasteries and museums by looters and antique hunters, expert use of new technology is essential. Monastics will learn to protect their monastery treasures through Risk Assessment and Disaster Mitigation.

<p>A cosa pensate, se sentite un <b>BAM!</b>?</p>
<p>Noi pensiamo ad una realtà fisica nata due anni fa o poco più a <a href=""http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapri"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Sapri</a>, piccola bomboniera del Sud dell'Italia, che ne conserva calore, slancio emotivo e senso creativo; una <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/bam.sapri?fref=ts"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Bottega Artistico Musicale</a> pubblica ed autogestita, messa in piedi (letteralmente autocostruita) in un'ex-falegnameria da un gruppo attivo di amici che sentiva, per sé e per gli altri, il bisogno di un luogo di libera espressione, fruizione e diffusione dei saperi di ogni tipo, che fosse lontano dalle logiche inerti del paesello di provincia abbandonato alle proprie criticità, e che potesse, proprio per questo, dar rilievo e curarsi dei propri luoghi, aiutando i suoi abitanti a scoprire e scoprirsi attraverso l'<b>Arte</b>, la <b>Musica</b>, lo <b>Stare Insieme</b>, la<b> Cultura</b>.</p>
<p>Ebbene, a distanza di due anni di <i>parole</i>, oltre che di intensa attività elaborativa e produttiva, di collaborazioni, scambi e riflessioni, spesso fisicamente lontane dagli spazi che viviamo, oggi decidiamo di fermarci, nei quattro giorni del <b>30 Aprile/1-2-3 Maggio 2015</b>, a raccontarci, per una volta, attraverso le nostre stesse storie, a dare voce alle nostre stesse gole, e ad un <b>Sud</b> finalmente libero di dire.</p>

<p><i>What do you think about, when you hear a <b>BAM!</b>?</i></p>
<p><i>We think about a physical place borned two years ago or more in <a href=""http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapri"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Sapri</a>, a little bonbonniére in the South of Italy, which keeps its warmth, emotional impulse and creative sense; a <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/bam.sapri?fref=ts"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Bottega Artistico Musicale</a> public and self-managed, built (literally self-built) into an ex-joiner's workshop from an operative group of friends who needed, for itself and for others, a situation that could embrace free expression, fruition and diffusion of any kind of knowledges, that could stay away from the inert logics of the village left to its own criticalities, and that could underline and take cure, just for that, of its own places, helping its citizens to discover and exposing through<b> Art</b>, <b>Music</b>, <b>Being Together</b>, <b>Culture</b>.</i></p>

<h3>
<i>What's </i>Mò.Dì [Damned Word Festival]<i>?</i>
</h3> <p><br/></p>
<p>[ITA]</p>
<p>Nasce così, grazie al prezioso contributo linguistico del dialetto che parliamo, il <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/pages/Mod%C3%AC-Maledetto-festival-della-parola/1548005925470066?fref=ts"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Mò.dì</a> (<b>""Ora, dici!""</b>), il nostro e vostro <b>Maledetto Festival della Parola</b>, una creatura autofinanziata, plasmabile ed interattiva che prenderà vita a Sapri, nei suoi vichi, sul suo mare, nelle sue piazze e nei suoi giardini, sui balconi e sui tetti, sotto il Sole primaverile, con l'intento di (ri)scoprire il linguaggio (e, alla John Cage, la sua grande assenza, il silenzio) come luogo antropologico, come veicolo fondamentale d'informazione quotidiana, come strumento primo di<b> libera fruizione e diffusione del sapere</b>, come massa da plasmare e rielaborare in senso artistico; e con l'obiettivo di mirare, dunque, alla sua straordinaria capacità di filtrare, attraverso una vastissima gamma di schemi possibili, la vera essenza dei nostri e dei vostri popoli.</p>
<p>Dannatamente e politicamente contrario a qualsiasi forma di chiusura, e composto nelle sue parti specifiche da mostre, laboratori, letture pubbliche, workshop, incontri, presentazioni, dibattiti, performance ed installazioni completamente e convintamente aperti a tutti, il Festival Maledetto proverà, per quest'anno, a sfidare e sfidarsi filtrando i suoi contenuti attraverso la tematica del <b>Limite</b>, della <b>Barriera</b>; cercando di tendere i propri <i>discorsi</i> verso questioni diffusamente sentite e pregnanti quali l'(an)affettività verbale, il parlato d'oggi e d'un tempo, le tradizioni oralmente trasmesse, le peculiarità linguistiche mondiali e regionali, il patrimonio dialettale, i linguaggi alternativi, la digitalizzazione totalizzante, il twitteraggio da strapazzo, l'incomunicabilità socio-culturale dell'attuale mondo conosciuto e i movimentismi di zona. </p>
<p>Il tutto esprimendoci attraverso l'Arte e le sue figlie (<b>la parola nella Musica, nel Teatro, nel Cinema, nella Fotografia, nella Scrittura, nella Street Art, nella Fumettistica, nell'Interaction e Public Design</b>), e concependo gli sforzi spesi sempre e solo come collettivi, inseriti all'interno di una rete di scambio e solidarietà cucita assieme da spiriti ed interessi comuni, sempre presente nel nostro lavoro, a partire (lo si può dedurre) dai metodi di finanziamento prescelti.</p>
<p>[ENG]</p>
<p><i>So it rises, thanks to the precious linguistic contribution of the dialect we speak, <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/pages/Mod%C3%AC-Maledetto-festival-della-parola/1548005925470066?fref=ts"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Mò.dì</a> (""Now, say!""), our and your <b>Damned Word Festival</b>, a self-financed, pliable and interactive creature that will come to life in Sapri, into its alleys, on its sea, into its squares and gardens, on balconies and roofs, under the springy Sun, with the aim of (re)discovering language (and, as John Cage, its big absence, silence) as an anthropological situation, as a basic vehicle of daily information, as a primary instrument of <b>free fruition and diffusion of knowledge</b>, as a bulk to shape and re-elaborate in an artistic way; and therefore with the goal of looking to its extraordinary ability of filtering, through the most open range of possible schemes, the real essence of ours and yours people.</i></p>
<p><i>Terribly and politically opposite to any shape of closure, and made, in its specific parts, of exhibits, labs, public lectures, workshops, meetings, presentations, debates, performances and installations completely and decidedly open to everyone, the Damned Festival will try, for this year, to challenge itself and others filtering its contents through the theme of the <b>Limit</b>, of the <b>Barrier</b>; attempting to stretch its own conversations to questions diffusely felt and pregnant like verbal (non-)sensitivity, like today's and yesterday's spoken, like traditions orally passed on, linguistic regional and mondial peculiarities, dialectal heritage, alternative languages, scoring computeration, lousy twittering, social and cultural                 (non-)communicability of the present known-world and regional movements.</i></p>
<p><i>The all thing expressing ourself through Art and her daughters (<b>word in Music, in Theater, in Cinema, in Photography, in Writing, in Street Art, in Comics, in Interaction and Public Design</b>), and conceiving the pains spended always as collective, inserted into an exchange and solidarity netting stitched together from common spirits and interests, always present in our work, starting from (you can say that!) the financing methods chosen.</i></p>

<p>Il vostro contributo, la somma di €2300, che ci auguriamo di poter raggiungere attraverso la campagna di crowdfunding imbastita grazie ad Indiegogo, che ancora ringraziamo, servirà, nello specifico, a coprire le spese dei materiali da autocostruzione (che aiuteranno, secondo le necessità, la realizzazione e la messa in atto delle singole installazioni del Festival), e quelle relative all'ingaggio e al rimborso dei soggetti ospiti dell'evento che, pure, parteciperanno in maniera attiva alla sua creazione. Qualora non dovessimo riuscire ad arrivare al tetto prefissato, saremmo costretti a ridurre il numero e la portata delle attività proposte; nel caso in cui, al contrario, dovessimo trovarci ad avere a disposizione un totale maggiore, sfrutteremmo senz'altro il denaro in più per contattare altri eventuali artisti ed interlocutori, o pensare ad un prolungamento del Festival durante la stagione estiva. </p>

<div>BAM! Bottega Artistico Musicale</div>
</div></div>","Avete sentito un BAM!?
Chi siamo e dove vogliamo arrivare 
Have you heard a BAM!? 
Who are we and where we want to get


[ITA]

A cosa pensate, se sentite un BAM!?
Noi pensiamo ad una realtà fisica nata due anni fa o poco più a Sapri, piccola bomboniera del Sud dell'Italia, che ne conserva calore, slancio emotivo e senso creativo; una Bottega Artistico Musicale pubblica ed autogestita, messa in piedi (letteralmente autocostruita) in un'ex-falegnameria da un gruppo attivo di amici che sentiva, per sé e per gli altri, il bisogno di un luogo di libera espressione, fruizione e diffusione dei saperi di ogni tipo, che fosse lontano dalle logiche inerti del paesello di provincia abbandonato alle proprie criticità, e che potesse, proprio per questo, dar rilievo e curarsi dei propri luoghi, aiutando i suoi abitanti a scoprire e scoprirsi attraverso l'Arte, la Musica, lo Stare Insieme, la Cultura.
Ebbene, a distanza di due anni di parole, oltre che di intensa attività elaborativa e produttiva, di collaborazioni, scambi e riflessioni, spesso fisicamente lontane dagli spazi che viviamo, oggi decidiamo di fermarci, nei quattro giorni del 30 Aprile/1-2-3 Maggio 2015, a raccontarci, per una volta, attraverso le nostre stesse storie, a dare voce alle nostre stesse gole, e ad un Sud finalmente libero di dire.
[ENG]
What do you think about, when you hear a BAM!?
We think about a physical place borned two years ago or more in Sapri, a little bonbonniére in the South of Italy, which keeps its warmth, emotional impulse and creative sense; a Bottega Artistico Musicale public and self-managed, built (literally self-built) into an ex-joiner's workshop from an operative group of friends who needed, for itself and for others, a situation that could embrace free expression, fruition and diffusion of any kind of knowledges, that could stay away from the inert logics of the village left to its own criticalities, and that could underline and take cure, just for that, of its own places, helping its citizens to discover and exposing through Art, Music, Being Together, Culture.
Well, after two years of words, besides an intense planning and productive activity, co-works, exchanges and reflections, often physically far from the places we live, today we decide to stop, from the 30 of April till the 3 of May, to tell us, for once, through our own stories, to give voice to our own throats, and to a South finally free to say.    




E ora, dici! 
Cos'è il Mò.Dì [Maledetto Festival della Parola]? 
And now, say! 

What's Mò.Dì [Damned Word Festival]?
 
[ITA]
Nasce così, grazie al prezioso contributo linguistico del dialetto che parliamo, il Mò.dì (""Ora, dici!""), il nostro e vostro Maledetto Festival della Parola, una creatura autofinanziata, plasmabile ed interattiva che prenderà vita a Sapri, nei suoi vichi, sul suo mare, nelle sue piazze e nei suoi giardini, sui balconi e sui tetti, sotto il Sole primaverile, con l'intento di (ri)scoprire il linguaggio (e, alla John Cage, la sua grande assenza, il silenzio) come luogo antropologico, come veicolo fondamentale d'informazione quotidiana, come strumento primo di libera fruizione e diffusione del sapere, come massa da plasmare e rielaborare in senso artistico; e con l'obiettivo di mirare, dunque, alla sua straordinaria capacità di filtrare, attraverso una vastissima gamma di schemi possibili, la vera essenza dei nostri e dei vostri popoli.
Dannatamente e politicamente contrario a qualsiasi forma di chiusura, e composto nelle sue parti specifiche da mostre, laboratori, letture pubbliche, workshop, incontri, presentazioni, dibattiti, performance ed installazioni completamente e convintamente aperti a tutti, il Festival Maledetto proverà, per quest'anno, a sfidare e sfidarsi filtrando i suoi contenuti attraverso la tematica del Limite, della Barriera; cercando di tendere i propri discorsi verso questioni diffusamente sentite e pregnanti quali l'(an)affettività verbale, il parlato d'oggi e d'un tempo, le tradizioni oralmente trasmesse, le peculiarità linguistiche mondiali e regionali, il patrimonio dialettale, i linguaggi alternativi, la digitalizzazione totalizzante, il twitteraggio da strapazzo, l'incomunicabilità socio-culturale dell'attuale mondo conosciuto e i movimentismi di zona. 
Il tutto esprimendoci attraverso l'Arte e le sue figlie (la parola nella Musica, nel Teatro, nel Cinema, nella Fotografia, nella Scrittura, nella Street Art, nella Fumettistica, nell'Interaction e Public Design), e concependo gli sforzi spesi sempre e solo come collettivi, inseriti all'interno di una rete di scambio e solidarietà cucita assieme da spiriti ed interessi comuni, sempre presente nel nostro lavoro, a partire (lo si può dedurre) dai metodi di finanziamento prescelti.
[ENG]
So it rises, thanks to the precious linguistic contribution of the dialect we speak, Mò.dì (""Now, say!""), our and your Damned Word Festival, a self-financed, pliable and interactive creature that will come to life in Sapri, into its alleys, on its sea, into its squares and gardens, on balconies and roofs, under the springy Sun, with the aim of (re)discovering language (and, as John Cage, its big absence, silence) as an anthropological situation, as a basic vehicle of daily information, as a primary instrument of free fruition and diffusion of knowledge, as a bulk to shape and re-elaborate in an artistic way; and therefore with the goal of looking to its extraordinary ability of filtering, through the most open range of possible schemes, the real essence of ours and yours people.
Terribly and politically opposite to any shape of closure, and made, in its specific parts, of exhibits, labs, public lectures, workshops, meetings, presentations, debates, performances and installations completely and decidedly open to everyone, the Damned Festival will try, for this year, to challenge itself and others filtering its contents through the theme of the Limit, of the Barrier; attempting to stretch its own conversations to questions diffusely felt and pregnant like verbal (non-)sensitivity, like today's and yesterday's spoken, like traditions orally passed on, linguistic regional and mondial peculiarities, dialectal heritage, alternative languages, scoring computeration, lousy twittering, social and cultural                 (non-)communicability of the present known-world and regional movements.
The all thing expressing ourself through Art and her daughters (word in Music, in Theater, in Cinema, in Photography, in Writing, in Street Art, in Comics, in Interaction and Public Design), and conceiving the pains spended always as collective, inserted into an exchange and solidarity netting stitched together from common spirits and interests, always present in our work, starting from (you can say that!) the financing methods chosen.





E i vostri contributi? 
What about your contributions?

[ITA]
Il vostro contributo, la somma di €2300, che ci auguriamo di poter raggiungere attraverso la campagna di crowdfunding imbastita grazie ad Indiegogo, che ancora ringraziamo, servirà, nello specifico, a coprire le spese dei materiali da autocostruzione (che aiuteranno, secondo le necessità, la realizzazione e la messa in atto delle singole installazioni del Festival), e quelle relative all'ingaggio e al rimborso dei soggetti ospiti dell'evento che, pure, parteciperanno in maniera attiva alla sua creazione. Qualora non dovessimo riuscire ad arrivare al tetto prefissato, saremmo costretti a ridurre il numero e la portata delle attività proposte; nel caso in cui, al contrario, dovessimo trovarci ad avere a disposizione un totale maggiore, sfrutteremmo senz'altro il denaro in più per contattare altri eventuali artisti ed interlocutori, o pensare ad un prolungamento del Festival durante la stagione estiva. 
[ENG]
Your contribution, the sum of €2300, that we wish to reach through the crowdfunding campaign basted thanks to Indiegogo, that we also want to thank, will be necessary, specifically, to cover the self-building materials' (that will help, according to situations, Festival's installations' fulfillment and implementation) costs, and those costs related to hiring and refunding the event's guests who, also, will participate in an active way to its creation. In case we won't reach the roof prefixed, we'll have to reduce the number and the weight of the activities proposed; in case, indeed, we'll find us reaching a bigger goal, we will definely use the money to contact others contingent artists and interlocutors, or think about an extension for the Festival during summer.
    
Dove siamo stati negli ultimi 5 anni? 
Where we've been in the last 5 years?


[ITA]
Da 5 anni, a Sapri, una rete di soggetti e associazioni
locali di cui siamo diretti protagonisti, con la collaborazione di soggetti extralocali, ragiona sulla
rigenerazione urbana dal basso, puntando l’azione soprattutto sugli spazi
pubblici abbandonati, degradati, non utilizzati. Partendo da un approccio
interdisciplinare, partecipato e orizzontale, di ricerca/azione, nascono l’orto sociale Via Campesina, un campo da basket, il Festival Internazionale di Street art Oltre Il Muro, la BAM! (riuso di
un’ex-falegnameria pubblica e centro di produzione culturale indipendente), il
BAMgarden (giardino pubblico autogestito) ed INNESTI (processo di
rivitalizzazione di spazi marginali, progetto di Cilento Labscape con il DIARC- Università di Napoli, che trasforma, a partire dai bisogni degli e con gli
abitanti, un parcheggio in una piazza autogestita).
[ENG]
Since 5 years, in Sapri, a net of local subjects and associations of which we are direct characters, with the help of extralocal subjects, reflects on the urban regeneration from the low, focusing most of all the action on public, abandoned, downgraded, unused spaces. Starting from an inter-disciplinary approach, partecipated and horizontal, a research/acting approach, come to life the social vegetable garden in Via Campesina, a basketball camp, the International Street art Festival Oltre il Muro, BAM! (re-use of an ex-public joinery and centre of independent and cultural production), the BAMgarden (a public and self-managed garden) and INNESTI (a marginal spaces' re-vitalization process, a project by Cilento Labscape featuring DIARC-University of Naples, that transform, starting from citizens' needs and with them, a parking into a self-managed square).

<h3>The Impact</h3> <p>
</p>
<p>A refugee camp is the most dangerous
place for a child. Over 45 countries are at war today, meaning that millions of children around the world struggle with the physical and psychological traumas of war. In Lebanon, there are Iraqi, Palestinian, Sudanese and now over 1.1
million registered Syrian refugees, causing a huge spillover effect. Not to mention, with over 4 million refugees fleeing the conflict in Syria, it is the world’s single
largest refugee crisis for almost a quarter of a century under UNHCR’s
mandate. Refugee children have higher
risk of death, disability, and becoming rape victims. They are often taken out
of school, become homeless, orphaned or are forced into violence. Their quality of life is
drastically deteriorated causing serious physical and psychological suffering
that can have a lasting effect on the course of their lives. </p>
<p>These artistic workshops teach
participants realistic ways of coping with the negative consequences of war. This is called psychological resilience and is
the best way to prevent the development of psychological dysfunction in
war-affected children. Art-based therapies are scientifically proven to enhance
resilience and can easily be implemented in refugee camps.</p> </div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>I am looking forward to implementing this project and many more to come, but I need your help to make it happen. If everything goes as planned, I should be able to go on the field by July 2016. I am determined to get this project running and I would just love to see you be part of it with me. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">  </span></p>

Help positively impact a child at risk.
Hep generate missing research data about resilience for war-affected children.
Support and improve western aid offering psychosocial support.
Actively participate in the development of this unique intervention.

Supporting our artists by buying and promoting their art is the best way to support our campaign.To do this, first you need to support Rock Around Asia, who is developing this platform.You do this by ""purchasing"" a perk, which gives you a large discount to the artworks on the platform.What is our business model?
For each artwork sold on the platform:- 40% goes to the artist- 40% goes to Rock Around Asia- 20% goes to a fund used to promote and support the artists through education, exhibitions, events, workshops etc.What do you get?
Because you give to this campaign, you help Rock Around Asia, so in return, we will decrease 10%, 25% or 40% from our commission from the artwork sale price, depending on which perk you choose. Once you have chosen a perk, you become an automatic Premium Member and can get a 10%, 25% or 40% discount on any artwork from the platform. How Do You Get Your Discount?
Once you have donated, go to the platform at www.emerging-artists-thailand.com and create an account. When you have selected an artwork, send us a message and we will provide you with a coupon for the discount.How Else Can You Help?
If
you feel that you cannot donate to us right now, then there’s plenty of other
ways that you can help. Help us by sharing this campaign, and by getting the
word out about our project!

there,</i></b></p>
<p><i>We are Independent
Theatre - a new Bulgarian theatre company. Recently we've started a program
called New Beginnings. Our goal is simple: each year we select one of the debut
shows, created by the alumni of The National Academy for Theatre and Film Arts in
Sofia, Bulgaria and  invite its team to keep on giving performances on our
stage. This year we've selected ""Dead Souls"", directed by Teya
Sugareva. But we've faced an unexpected issue. So here is what Teya and her
team have to say about it:</i></p>
<p>We are young emerging
theatre artists. We need money to recreate our debut performance “Dead Souls”
and extent its life outside of the Theatre Academy. We have already found a
Theatre company (Independent Theatre), who will share their building with us,
without any rent charges and who will promote the show among their audience.
And this is huge! It is one of a kind gesture, when it comes to Bulgarian
theatre industry. And they agreed, because they really like the show. </p>
<p><a href=""http://www.intheatre.bg/predstavlenia/martvi-dushi"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><b><span>DEAD SOULS page in Independent Theatre's website</span></b></a></p>
<p>But we have a problem.
The set and costumes were destroyed by the Theatre Academy after our
graduation. So we raise money to be able to rebuild everything and to upgrade
its artistic quality if possible.</p>
<p><b>What we need?</b></p><p><b>We need 2000$ for our
decor: for
materials and working-out in a manufactory for creating professional theatrical
decors and sets.<br/>We need 1000$ for our
costumes: for materials (fabrics) and sewing. The projects of the costumes
exist, but we have to sew them again.<br/>We need 1000$ for
stage lighting: we have to buy special spotlights that the theater does not have
at this moment to illuminate the performance in the best way.</b></p><p><b></b></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2F98Y5kTJBTio%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D98Y5kTJBTio&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F98Y5kTJBTio%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><b><br/></b><p></p>

<div>
<p>Hi there! We are Lucia Masango and Eleanor Evans, curators and artists for the 'To Fly (Freedom)' exhibition taking place at Gaffa in Sydney, Australia from May 28 to June 8. </p>
<p>The <i>To Fly </i>exhibition
consists of up and coming Australian, South African and Chinese artists from different mediums and it will showcase works including paintings, jewellery, photography, video and
animation. </p>
<p>The concept behind our exhibition is to explore what freedom
means in the context of the modern world. <i>To Fly </i>aims
to explore this topic from a variety of view points including the
beauty of freedom but also challenging the notion of freedom as it currently
exists in terms of the use of the word for gain politically or financially.
Through our work, we create representations of freedom in ways that relate to our unique perceptions of freedom as a result of cultural,
social and economical backgrounds. </p>
<p>The exhibition will focus on various topics of our choice in relation to the theme freedom. </p>

</div></div>","Our Exhibition

Hi there! We are Lucia Masango and Eleanor Evans, curators and artists for the 'To Fly (Freedom)' exhibition taking place at Gaffa in Sydney, Australia from May 28 to June 8. 
The To Fly exhibition
consists of up and coming Australian, South African and Chinese artists from different mediums and it will showcase works including paintings, jewellery, photography, video and
animation. 
The concept behind our exhibition is to explore what freedom
means in the context of the modern world. To Fly aims
to explore this topic from a variety of view points including the
beauty of freedom but also challenging the notion of freedom as it currently
exists in terms of the use of the word for gain politically or financially.
Through our work, we create representations of freedom in ways that relate to our unique perceptions of freedom as a result of cultural,
social and economical backgrounds. 
The exhibition will focus on various topics of our choice in relation to the theme freedom. 
Who We Are, What We Are Doing

Lucia Masango: I am a South African artist who graduated from the Australian National University (ANU) in 2013. My primary art medium is video and I have experience in video art, video production and postproduction for film, television and social media. I have exhibited works in various galleries including the ANU Main Gallery, PhotoSpace Gallery and Foyer Gallery.

My video and series of paintings titled We Die Like Animals are addressing the topic of humanity, the lack of humanity and its impact on freedom with regards to racism and classism.

<p><i>'Everybody needs beauty as well as bread, places to play in and pray in, where nature may heal and give strength to body and soul.'</i></p>
<p>John Muir <i>(on Julia Morgan: Architect of Beauty)</i></p>
<p>Enriched words from the father of Our Natural Parks.  </p>
<p>So why are we here, committing ourselves to notions that were espoused such a long time ago?  What power have these ideas that we plea never to lose touch of them.     This is a story about resurrecting a past tradition and infusing it into today's architectural discourse.  There is an urgency here.  We cannot abandon a movement that is so bound to the protection and guardianship of our future.            It must be acknowledged that the First Bay Area Tradition has real roots here and Julia Morgan was an essence of that authenticity and mindfulness.  She was our pioneer of sustainability.  Her buildings resonated the breath of their environments and ultimately grew from site.  Alas, one hundred years have elapsed and this embedded knowledge of her processes are forgotten.  </p>
<p>Now, more than ever, we need reminding.</p>
<p>Hence, the opportunity is here and now.   </p>
<p>'Emergence' is a site specific installation that reflects the First Bay Area Tradition's architectural philosophy.  We envisage a space that is in the process of growth within the site.  It is a phenomenological installation that is ultimately capturing a moment of transformation, both within self and place.  It is wholly emergent.    </p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span></p>
<p><b>Site</b></p>
<p>The site where we propose this installation is currently an unkempt lawn at the rear of a Julia Morgan designed home at 3630 Jackson Street in San Francisco.  The home has been chosen for this year's San Francisco Decorator Showcase and will be open to the public from April 25th to May 25th.  All proceeds of the event will benefit the local University High School's financial aid program.  </p>
<p>Our design practice, Siol, has participated in this event in years previously and understand succinctly what it takes to get a project of this typology built.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Details</span></p>
<p>The design entails a 15' x 15' courtyard that is sunken into the landscape.  Earth bermed retaining walls (8' high) provide both physical enclosure and acoustic isolation.  The only entry point is a narrowing gravel pathway that directly slopes into the space.  A smooth dark earth plaster on the walls encloses upon the visitor as one approaches the space.  The interior slate shingled walls are a nod to both the existing home and the tradition's choice of natural materiality, while the wall's sectional entasis allows natural light to penetrate within.  A series of concealed light wells within the structure diffuse natural light to specific areas.  This ephemeral quality of shifting light only enhances the depth of the space.  Integrated seating within the walls encourage pause and reflection.  At the center point of the space, a mature oak tree provides the direct focal point of the installation.  The tree has several layers of interpretation.  It is a direct reminder of the architecture we strive to create.  In the words of architect William McDonough. </p>
<p>'Imagine a home that, like a tree, generates its own energy from the sun; that produces food, provides shelter, encourages biodiversity, eliminates waste and helps protect water resources.'  </p>
<p>We sense that Julia Morgan would be harmoniously aligned to such a lofty analogy for the future of architecture.  The tree also represented a bigger mystical and aesthetic component within the installation.  It is an enquiry into society's perception of the meaning of nature and humanity's role within the ecosystem.                  </p>
</div><div>
<p><b>Budget</b><br/></p>
<p>We are currently $30k short of making this a reality.  Hence, we need help!!!!!!!     Timing is also not on our side as we need to start construction on March 1st to make our deadline for the public opening.  If we don't make our budget we will have to drastically value engineer the entire project and in our opinion, diminish the essence of the installation.    </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Some history for those not familiar with Julia Morgan.  <br/></p>
<p><b>Julia Morgan and the First Bay Area Tradition (1880 - 1925)</b></p>
<p>Julia Morgan was not only the first female licensed architect in California, she was also instrumental is defining an architectural philosophy, a legacy we now define as the First Bay Area Tradition.  In 2014, she was posthumously rewarded the AIA Gold Medal, the first woman to be bestowed with the honor.  Along with other Bay Area architectural luminaries such as Bernard Maybeck, Ernest Coxhead and Willis Polk, the First Bay Area Tradition was heavily influenced by the teachings of Ruskin, Emerson, Thoreau and Morris.  This connectivity and respect for place, nature and craftsmanship was core to this tradition.  They embraced an honesty in the expression of architecture and understood the site to be integral to the design process. </p>

</div>GonzoFest 2015, curated by Hunter's longtime friend and fellow poet Ron Whitehead and executed by the magnifcent seven is the culmination of 20 years of brainstorming, planning, and plotting ways to secure the rememberance of one of Louisville's greatest unsung heroes, Hunter S. Thompson. Last year we succeeded with the help of many partners to commemorate Hunter with a Hometown Hero banner now displayed on Bardstown Rd on the Bristol Bar and Grill building, and this year we hope to continue the tradition with a Hunter S.

Poets and writers will read their Gonzo and Hunter S.

<p><b>MY BACKGROUND</b> </p>
<p>I started my journey into photography a little over two years ago after several injuries stopped me from continuing my career as a professional dancer. Since the day I was born, my life has always revolved around creativity. Creating something, making art and chasing dreams is what I live for. When I got into photography fashion was the obvious choice as my vision is very feminine and romantic. With hard work and lots of stubbornness I managed to turn photography into a career within just a few months. I love creating and designing beautiful images and bringing them to life. I love telling fairytales through them.  </p>

THE STORY BEHIND THE PROJECT 

After two years in the fashion business I started to feel torn inside.  Fashion is a beautiful form of art, no doubt about that, and I do love my job. I wake up every morning and thank the universe for being able to live the life I live, for being my own boss and for being able to make a living being creative. What causes me to be so conflicted is the idea that I am contributing to setting a very unrealistic standard of beauty for the world and many women are suffering because of that.


The images I create, the images we see in magazines and billboards are not real: it takes hours and hours of work and big teams of people to achieve these results. After a few hours of hair and make up, professional styling, and lots of retouching the girl in the pictures doesn't even look like the girl in the picture!  The gorgeous girls I photograph are professional models. They are beautiful but only a very small percentage of women in the world look like that. Yet that's the standard we grow up looking at, and unfortunately many young women are negatively affected by it. I feel the need to create something more meaningful that could help to change the general perception of what real BEAUTY is. All of this has lead me to this project.

 
THE PROJECT

What I'd like to do with this project is to show men and women that real BEAUTY lies everywhere and in everyone. We can find amazing and different kinds of beauty from culture to culture, from country to country, and from person to person. 
My long term project is to travel to several countries and capture beautiful andcreative portraits of every day women, immersed in their own cultural and environmental settings. I will focus only on women as my vision is still very feminine and romantic.
 
These are the countries I'd like to cover in the long run (I'm thinking it will probably take at least 5 years to travel to them all and keep up with my life in NYC)
Morocco - Italy (Sicily&Alps) - Ethiopia -  Peru - China - Ireland - Mexico - India - Turkey - Cuba - Japan - Vietnam - Greece  - Russia - USA(Lousiana & Hawaii) - Indonesia - France (Provence & Brittany) - Iceland - Namibia - Yemen.

 
 


 
It would be amazing to eventually turn this project into an exhibition. Once the whole project is completed it could become a book that shows both the photographs and tells the stories of the women portrayed.   
It's an ambitious project but I have never believed in the word impossible! 

 
 


THE SPECIFICS
This campaign is only for the first TWO countries I'll cover: MOROCCO   (Essaouira, Chefchaouen , Marrakech) and  the ITALIAN ALPS. If the project is successful [and it will be ;) ] I will move forward with shooting in all the other countries on the list above and do future campaigns if needed.
I would love to shoot 5 to 10 creative portraits for each country on the list. And collect the stories of all the people who are willing to pose for me. I will be applying my unique photographic style that I use in my fashion work to these portraits in order to create something magical!
(Images below shot by me ) 
  


WHAT I NEED
I'm trying to raise $4000 to bring the first part of this project to life. Your contribution would go towards:
-Hiring a male assistant. (estimated $1000)
-Hiring a fixer/translator Morocco is a dangerous country for a  tiny, young caucasian girl with blonde hair and green eyes traveling by herself with expensive photography equipment. A fixer would also help me talk to the locals and collect their stories in Morocco, and would help keeping me  safe from possible attacks. (estimated $1000)
-Compensating all the people, the women that are willing to be photographed, for their time and for sharing their story. (estimated $1500  for 15 portraits, $100 per person)
-extra hard drives, memory cards, emergency gear to make sure we won't be restricted. (estimated $500)

 My name is Hilary (<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/platecaptains"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""> facebook profile</a>), I am an American artist originally from 
California. I have been living in Southern Sicily for the past 9 years. 
During this time I have witnessed the increasing crisis of refugees 
stranded on overcrowded boats trying to find sanctuary on our shores. In
 2013 there was a terrible tragedy off the Island of Lampedusa, with the
 loss of over 300 lives in sight of land. Some of those people are 
buried in the town where I live: Cianciana. In 2014 I finished a small
 project composed of 10 masks, commemorating these nameless victims. I am a
 migrant myself, although my journey to Sicily was far less harrowing. I feel a personal connection to people seeking <i><b><i><b> a new existence</b></i> either through choice or need</b></i>.

Spero che questo Mare dell'Umanità promuoverà discussione su soluzioni più positivi e umanitarie. Il più piccolo dei contributi sarà di aiuto. Un artista e molti molti volti a costruire.

<p><b>What is
Free Range Asheville?</b></p>
<p><a href=""http://www.freerangeavl.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Free Range Asheville</a> is a brand new arts organization established by Estelle Woodward
Arnal and Jeff Arnal as a platform for research and discourse where artists can
engage and collaborate in performance and laboratory settings with other
artists and organizations.  After
15 years of performing, curating, and producing music and dance in Brooklyn and
Philadelphia, Jeff and Estelle took a giant leap of faith and relocated to
Asheville, NC to rediscover their southern roots and pursue a long-held dream
of starting their own arts organization. </p>
<p>Free Range
Asheville is a nimble organization that offers programs in a variety of
settings ranging from under-utilized commercial spaces, traditional performance
venues, and natural environments throughout the Western North Carolina region. Our
vision is to create access points to culture that cross disciplines,
traditions, and genres for people of all ages and economic backgrounds. We are
committed to making Free Range Asheville programs accessible to everyone, and
admission to all of our events is $10 or less.</p><p></p><p><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></b></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1452568110/nesemsklofnvttti7xck.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Inaugural
Season</b></p>
<p>We are
thrilled to launch Free Range Asheville’s inaugural season which will kick-off
on February 23, 2016 with the highly acclaimed classical chamber orchestra <a href=""http://www.theknightsnyc.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Knights</a> at <a href=""http://www.dwtheatre.com/performances/calendar/2015-16-rentals/the-knights-presented-by-free-range-asheville"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Diana Wortham Theatre </a>in Asheville.</p>
<p>Throughout
2016 we will host a series of dialogues with cultural thinkers, offering
audiences an opportunity to gain insight into their influences and creative process. We
are excited to welcome pianist, teacher and writer, <a href=""http://www.jonathanbiss.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Jonathan
Biss</a> for a conversation
on April 3, and on April 7 we will host a solo performance and discussion with
MacArthur award-winning saxophonist &amp; composer, <a href=""http://kenvandermark.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Ken
Vandermark</a>. </p>
<p>This is just
the beginning!  We hope you will
consider supporting Free Range Asheville. Your gift will allow us to continue
developing adventurous programming for the communities in Western North
Carolina and beyond. An exciting roster of artists is planned for the second
half of 2016 including more music, dance, and interdisciplinary work.  We look forward to sharing the complete
line-up with you in the coming months.</p>
<p><b>Make it
Happen</b></p>
<p>The growth of
Free Range Asheville has been exhilarating, but we cannot sustain this work
without additional support. Funds raised from our IndieGoGo campaign will go toward expenses for the first half of our inaugural season. In order to cover artist fees, space rental, production and marketing costs, and ensure that we are able to keep ticket prices for Free Range Asheville
events at an affordable rate of $10 or less, we must raise a minimum of $5,000 by February 1.  Additionally, we have set a stretch goal of $10,000 to cover the second half of the 2016 season.</p>
<p>Free Range
Asheville is a labor of love and we are making a sizable personal investment in
this inaugural year. We have been working hard to secure sponsorships for the
2016 season and have been successful in obtaining underwriting from a number of
local businesses to offset the costs of housing and feeding visiting
artists.  As a new organization it
is essential that we establish a solid foundation of programming that
demonstrates our ability to successfully implement our vision and goals.  Without this track record, it is
extremely challenging to apply for grants or other types of institutional
funding, and we cannot rely on income from ticket sales alone to cover
expenses.</p>
<p>We invite you
to join us in helping make this dream a reality.  We are pleased to offer our supporters a singular collection
of perks that reflect the culture and counterculture that make Asheville a
place like no other.</p>
<p><b>Thank
You!</b></p>
<p>Every gift of any amount makes a difference and brings us that much closer

<p></p></div>","What is
Free Range Asheville?
Free Range Asheville is a brand new arts organization established by Estelle Woodward
Arnal and Jeff Arnal as a platform for research and discourse where artists can
engage and collaborate in performance and laboratory settings with other
artists and organizations.  After
15 years of performing, curating, and producing music and dance in Brooklyn and
Philadelphia, Jeff and Estelle took a giant leap of faith and relocated to
Asheville, NC to rediscover their southern roots and pursue a long-held dream
of starting their own arts organization. 
Free Range
Asheville is a nimble organization that offers programs in a variety of
settings ranging from under-utilized commercial spaces, traditional performance
venues, and natural environments throughout the Western North Carolina region. Our
vision is to create access points to culture that cross disciplines,
traditions, and genres for people of all ages and economic backgrounds. We are
committed to making Free Range Asheville programs accessible to everyone, and
admission to all of our events is $10 or less.Inaugural
Season
We are
thrilled to launch Free Range Asheville’s inaugural season which will kick-off
on February 23, 2016 with the highly acclaimed classical chamber orchestra The Knights at The Diana Wortham Theatre in Asheville.
Throughout
2016 we will host a series of dialogues with cultural thinkers, offering
audiences an opportunity to gain insight into their influences and creative process. We
are excited to welcome pianist, teacher and writer, Jonathan
Biss for a conversation
on April 3, and on April 7 we will host a solo performance and discussion with
MacArthur award-winning saxophonist & composer, Ken
Vandermark. 
This is just
the beginning!  We hope you will
consider supporting Free Range Asheville. Your gift will allow us to continue
developing adventurous programming for the communities in Western North
Carolina and beyond. An exciting roster of artists is planned for the second
half of 2016 including more music, dance, and interdisciplinary work.  We look forward to sharing the complete
line-up with you in the coming months.
Make it
Happen
The growth of
Free Range Asheville has been exhilarating, but we cannot sustain this work
without additional support. Funds raised from our IndieGoGo campaign will go toward expenses for the first half of our inaugural season. In order to cover artist fees, space rental, production and marketing costs, and ensure that we are able to keep ticket prices for Free Range Asheville
events at an affordable rate of $10 or less, we must raise a minimum of $5,000 by February 1.  Additionally, we have set a stretch goal of $10,000 to cover the second half of the 2016 season.
Free Range
Asheville is a labor of love and we are making a sizable personal investment in
this inaugural year. We have been working hard to secure sponsorships for the
2016 season and have been successful in obtaining underwriting from a number of
local businesses to offset the costs of housing and feeding visiting
artists.  As a new organization it
is essential that we establish a solid foundation of programming that
demonstrates our ability to successfully implement our vision and goals.  Without this track record, it is
extremely challenging to apply for grants or other types of institutional
funding, and we cannot rely on income from ticket sales alone to cover
expenses.
We invite you
to join us in helping make this dream a reality.  We are pleased to offer our supporters a singular collection
of perks that reflect the culture and counterculture that make Asheville a
place like no other.
Thank
You!
Every gift of any amount makes a difference and brings us that much closer
to reaching our goal of $5,000 by February 1.  Thank you for considering our request for vital support for
Free Range Asheville!

  WHO WE ARE


For over a year, a group of architects, landscape architects, and artists have been meeting with city officials and community arts and river advocates, and have formed the LA River Public Art Project, whose vision is to ensure an arts and culture infrastructure on river revitalization projects. 
Elaine Rene-Weissman is an Architect, LEED AP, and principal of ERW DESIGN.

Des artistes qui défendent une vision, mais rêvent d’inclusion. Les artistes handicapé/es sont trop souvent mis/es de côté, mais on oublie vite que le handicap, ce n'est pas végéter à attendre que le temps passe.

<p>Outre des places VIP pour certaines performances, nous offrons également des prix offerts par certains de nos commanditaires, des magazines édités par notre organisme et même, des séances photos/vidéos.</p>
<p>Tout ce que vous aurez la gentillesse de nous donner servira à offrir à tou/tes nos invité/es (artistes et spectateur/trices) la meilleure des expériences, afin de pouvoir rendre ce festival annuel.

<p></p>The city of Ypsilanti is on the upsurge. Imagine a tiny little midwestern New York City or San Francisco of the 80s. Artists and entrepreneurs and wonderful believers of all walks are reinvigorating the city with hope and love and life.

<p></p>
<p>On a deeper level, Lampshade is a sanctuary. A focused aggregator of light. We're all incredibly powerful and creative. So let's go on an adventure. Outside of the fear of lack. There is abundance, always. Enough love, enough money, enough talent, enough looks, enough God for everyone. There is always enough.</p>

Hi. I'm Ricky. And I want to introduce you to Lampshade.

Lampshade is a place to conjure magic. 
To explore yourself. To be yourself. To share yourself. To incubate ideas, get inspired, collaborate, create, and motivate.
Oh, and play.
A typical day at Lampshade might look something like this: 

6am-8am morning meditation and yoga
8am-6pm cafe, gallery, bookshop, revolution hub, impromptu stage
noon-1pm free school: how to make soap
3pm-4pm free school: how to play guitar
6pm-7pm nightly happy time happy hour (revolving)
7pm-8pm monthly youth open mic
8pm-10pm live jazz
10pm-? drag queen moonlight acro yoga




Lampshade is basically a one-stop bliss shop. It's a...



cafe
bookstore
performance & event space
music venue
art gallery and studio
yoga and meditation center
classroom
platform for ideas, panels, & talks
community and youth outreach
revolution hub
seller of local art, jewelry, stones, & crystals
Home of Le Shade: all-natural sundries - lotions, soaps, deodorants, etc.

The city of Ypsilanti is on the upsurge. Imagine a tiny little midwestern New York City or San Francisco of the 80s. Artists and entrepreneurs and wonderful believers of all walks are reinvigorating the city with hope and love and life. Lampshade wants to be a guiding light at the helm of the city's comeback.

What We Need & What You Get




We actually need around $100,000 but I am investing all of my savings and reaching out to many connections I've made over the years. This project has been brewing since 2008, and only now, with help from wonderful people like you - will lampshade birth into the world.  The space needs a lot of TLC. The building is old. And beautiful. But sad. Here's a few things we're working on:



Installing central air/heating


Revitalizing hardwood flooring


Redoing plumbing and electric


Renovating the basement


Building a stage


Building two handicap bathrooms


Building a small kitchen prep space

In (not-so-short) short - Transforming the entire building save for the gorgeous exposed red brick, which is what initially made us fall in love

We're building in downtown Ypsilanti, MI, which as I mentioned, is undergoing a wonderful transformation from crime and dilapidation to mindful, beautiful community full of small businesses and energetic folks with a vision. We couldn't be happier to join in the reawakening of a truly wonderful city. 

What You Get... We think our perks are pretty groovy. You can read all about them by looking to your right. Right now! Plus, you get to be an integral, foundation-level part of something different. If you don't live locally or can't make it to The Shade, we have a separate set of perks that are cool kid baller status.
The Impact

We can't overstate how big this project is. Our goal is to revolutionize how small business is run. To find that mindful fusion of commodity and community. We want to build safe spaces for people to have genuine, relaxed, open communication and collaboration to mindfully take us into this next generation and beyond. America is a great place, but it can be so much better. We must carve space outside of greed, capitalism, big banks, mindless conspicuous consumption, and fear of scarcity and competition. There is abundance. There is always enough!


    Risks & Challenges 
The building is old. Ypsilanti is still on the comeback. We need funding. Michigan is often cold. We have a large vision that could be perceived as scattered. We operate in a world that isn't always so mindful. We are genuinely good people who may get taken advantage of. . . 
There's inherent risk. And so we accept it. And then solve it.

As we said, this project is big and audacious. As we all should be! Why not take up more space? Believe in and explore Self a bit more? We are all one. Once we jump past fear, there's a whole new playground just waiting for us. But we must be brave. We must leap.
As with everything, there are risks. But only with great risk comes that illustrious - and often illusive - great reward. 
Other Ways You Can Help
 If you can't contribute financially, we understand. We're grateful you've read this far. We still need a lot of help. You could start by sharing this campaign on your social media platforms and with friends and family.

<p></p>
<p><i>Mission Statement: This residency is designed for the artist who is interested in personal development, caring for oneself - body, mind and spirit.  We are invested in you. Our goal is to nurture seamless homeostasis in the creative individual.  Through art, one gives birth to innovation and functionality.  The disposition of the thing birthed is of utmost importance as it participates in the expansion of our technological society and our shared consciousness.  Thus, the balance of the engineer/parent/artist/person at the heart of concern as his/her well-being is vital to local, global and cosmic POSITIVE growth.</i></p>
<p style=""display: inline !important;"">The global goal of<b> The Vetiver Foundation</b> <i>is to establish Ashrams in underserved communities.  Within these facilities, our volunteers — comprised of our residency faculty, paid curatorship and intensive recipients, community leaders and truly big-hearted individuals — will seek, rehabilitate and provide vocational instruction to  local candidates who demonstrate a strong interest in being part of bettering the lives of their fellow citizens.  These trainings will consist of deep healings, setting a firm foundation of the self in each candidate, followed by training as </i></p>
<ul>
<li><i>healers</i></li>
<li><i>artists</i></li>
<li><i>yogis</i></li>
<li><i>administrators</i></li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<p><i>The ashram members will also seek to provide access to career pathways outside of these frameworks so that possibilities as endless as those we, the providers, know may find their way into common conversation and consideration within these populations. </i></p>
<p><i></i></p>
<p><i>After setting up the structure for these positions, these growing leaders will be guided - at a pace incremental to their ability and in consideration of their ongoing needs - to outreach in their center and provide the same well-rounded recovery and support given them.  The ultimate focus is to support a population of purpose driven individuals and communities empowered toward <i>self-sustainment.</i></i></p>
<p><i><i><br/></i></i></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p><i>This residency is for artists of any creative proclivity, but provides modalities and classes that lean toward the performative aspect and includes weekly artist lectures by local and visiting established individuals and collaborators working in both the larger media public venue/ traditional theater for fine arts and in appropriated site-specific dance and performance creation.</i></p>
<p></p>
<p><i>Through our at-home and global outreach events and efforts, we will be partnering with medical staff, art supply companies, Ayurvedic and Chinese Medicinal clinics, spa and kitchen supply companies as well as chefs and Somatic Movement practitioners, yoga teachers, various kinds of fine and performing artists, human resource administrators and small business coaches.  </i></p>
<p><i>**</i>Our ultimate first year earning goal is $250,000.00.  We are seeking funds in quarterly segments because -- hey, I need to build a team and while it's just me and my one resident, done grass-roots style (in my apartment- they say your passions become your life, I wake up to mine), I aim to be BOTH realistic and hopeful. </p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<u style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">1st Quarter:</u><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> non-profit application and set-up + establishing organization procurement policies so we can apply for grants (yep, they charge for that), </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">art supplies + 1st residency exhibition facility rental, first residency meal &amp; transit stipend, add to foundation reserve (so far I've funded this part, but in order to continue and dedicate myself full-time, my savings need to go toward my personal/survival expenses) </span><br/>

Mission Statement: This residency is designed for the artist who is interested in personal development, caring for oneself - body, mind and spirit.  We are invested in you. Our goal is to nurture seamless homeostasis in the creative individual.  Through art, one gives birth to innovation and functionality.  The disposition of the thing birthed is of utmost importance as it participates in the expansion of our technological society and our shared consciousness.  Thus, the balance of the engineer/parent/artist/person at the heart of concern as his/her well-being is vital to local, global and cosmic POSITIVE growth.
The global goal of The Vetiver Foundation is to establish Ashrams in underserved communities.  Within these facilities, our volunteers — comprised of our residency faculty, paid curatorship and intensive recipients, community leaders and truly big-hearted individuals — will seek, rehabilitate and provide vocational instruction to  local candidates who demonstrate a strong interest in being part of bettering the lives of their fellow citizens.  These trainings will consist of deep healings, setting a firm foundation of the self in each candidate, followed by training as 

healers
artists
yogis
administrators



The ashram members will also seek to provide access to career pathways outside of these frameworks so that possibilities as endless as those we, the providers, know may find their way into common conversation and consideration within these populations. 

After setting up the structure for these positions, these growing leaders will be guided - at a pace incremental to their ability and in consideration of their ongoing needs - to outreach in their center and provide the same well-rounded recovery and support given them.  The ultimate focus is to support a population of purpose driven individuals and communities empowered toward self-sustainment.
   What We Need & What You Get This residency is for artists of any creative proclivity, but provides modalities and classes that lean toward the performative aspect and includes weekly artist lectures by local and visiting established individuals and collaborators working in both the larger media public venue/ traditional theater for fine arts and in appropriated site-specific dance and performance creation.

Through our at-home and global outreach events and efforts, we will be partnering with medical staff, art supply companies, Ayurvedic and Chinese Medicinal clinics, spa and kitchen supply companies as well as chefs and Somatic Movement practitioners, yoga teachers, various kinds of fine and performing artists, human resource administrators and small business coaches.  
**Our ultimate first year earning goal is $250,000.00.  We are seeking funds in quarterly segments because -- hey, I need to build a team and while it's just me and my one resident, done grass-roots style (in my apartment- they say your passions become your life, I wake up to mine), I aim to be BOTH realistic and hopeful. 



1st Quarter: non-profit application and set-up + establishing organization procurement policies so we can apply for grants (yep, they charge for that), art supplies + 1st residency exhibition facility rental, first residency meal & transit stipend, add to foundation reserve (so far I've funded this part, but in order to continue and dedicate myself full-time, my savings need to go toward my personal/survival expenses) 


2nd Quarter: utilities & cleaning in temporary 1st phase living + 2nd residency meal & transit stipend, small faculty expenses (hire PT grant writer/Gifts Rec'd Dept. Chair + 1 performance mentor), continue adding to foundation reserve


3rd Quarter: replenish art supplies, 2nd residency exhibition facility rental, 3rd residency meal & transit stipend, continued utilities & cleaning, begin purchasing larger curation supplies (includes performance staging) + opening/closing event expenses & press, small faculty expenses, continue adding to foundation reserve


4th Quarter: begin purchasing bedding for multiple residents (we plan to accommodate 4-6 per session), 3rd residency exhibition facility rental, 4th residency meal & transit stipend, continued utilities & cleaning, expand curation supplies  + opening/closing event expenses & press, small faculty expenses (hire 1 administration asst), continue adding to foundation reserve



In coordinating 2nd yr funding, it is projected that we will seek 2 additional healers + 1 additional artist/performance mentor + PT high-performance physio-expert (a combination of athlete and physician input).  At that stage, we will also be seeking expanded resident housing.  I have scouted a building with ample space for:

residency quarter, 
a yoga/meditation hall with smaller private session studios, 
resident studio workspace, 
performance hall, 
small holistic med-spa and counseling wing, 

Foundation administration offices.


...hopefully, the present owner is serious about his intention to donate this property to a non-profit {fingers crossed!}.

__________IF I don't reach my entire goal, I'll cry... and then I'll get right back up on the horse and try, try again!  This foundation is my baby.  I've been detailing it on paper for over a year and in my mind for a year before that and however long it's been marinating in my spiritual pathway just waiting for my mind to quiet down long enough that I received the inspired idea.  So, let's say the funds are short.  Wait, let's not say that!  Seeing as how I'm chugging along, making this thing happen in small ways already, the funds earned will go toward proliferating this small cell version of a cause all while continuing on in my efforts to take it to higher heights.    
The Impact 
As a performance artist and yoga therapist, I’ve been blessed to spend time with unbelievably talented and forward thinking individuals.  I’ve also witnessed the depths they are willing to survive for the sake of creating, innovating and sharing.  I was fortunate to grow up in a family devoted to working with the homeless, terminally ill, battered women and foster children — especially having been a foster/adopted child myself. These varied sides of experiences have led me to my current undertaking, the development of The Vetiver Foundation.

I’ve found it is important to start with “me”, to fast on goodness and allow that process to naturally cleanse the purpose-palette, to perform an exercise in creativity. I want to encourage creatives the world-over to ask and allow yourselves to receive the support you inherently deserve and the love of a fellow human being. 
In manifesting and manufacturing, we are giving AND receiving simultaneously. We are living our bliss and thereby providing an example for conscious, joyful universal expansion. 
Open the cage door and let it fly; creativity doesn’t want to be locked away.
   Risks & Challenges The only risk I'm taking is on you.  I need your help, which is really what defines this foundation -- each of us relying on the other for support in creating something that serves others.  Art, be it painting, dancing, photography, found appropriation, song or any other varied medium is a universal language.  Even if the words don't translate, the tonality and the essence of the performer does.  The gift of creating, the awesome opportunity to witness and interpret that creation as it relates to your own story, these things bond us as a race of humans.
So the challenge? It's to convince you and other outstanding, loving individuals like yourself that you, me, your neighbor's son, our global family is worth the support in creating, sharing, rehabilitating and repeating.

<p>Una visione, una <b>scommessa</b> contro
ogni tipo di ostacolo, che è riuscita ad innescare un <b>principio di
cambiamento</b> nel territorio, a <b>dialogare</b> in maniera
stretta con i suoi abitanti e a realizzare un evento di <b>arte</b> contemporanea
ad alto potenziale.</p>
<p>A nome di tutte le persone che donano e hanno

<p>** L’unicità e il successo della manifestazione
sono dovuti anche grazie alla presenza di eventi collaterali, quali: <b>SITE
SPECIFIC</b>, in collaborazione con <b>C.A.R.M.A.</b>, ha presentato <b>ORACULUM</b>,
un archivio di video arte internazionale tramite la piattaforma <b><i>Videoform</i></b>,
a cura di <b>Laurent Delaye</b> e <b>Clare Bradley</b>. Gli

performance di teatro/danza dell'associazione <b>Officine Papage</b> (Pomarance). </p>
<p><b>Adesso: IL CATALOGO M’ARTE 2015</b></p>
<p>Stiamo lavorando per un catalogo che esprima il
senso di work-in-progress della residenza stessa di M’arte 2015, che nasca
dall’interno e che rispecchi la compattezza di gruppo e l’energia impiegata
nella manifestazione. Per questo è curato interamente e gratuitamente dai
grafici dello studio <b>La Tigre, a loro volta creativi in residenza</b>.
Il tutto completato da due video/documentari, uno realizzato da Malia Bruker
sull’esperienza della residenza e uno realizzato da Alessandro Zangirolami
sulla performance urbana degli artisti Sasha Vinci e Maria Grazia Galesi.</p>
<p>La materia – prima di tutto – è quello che si trova
alla base dell’idea creativa dei grafici. Un catalogo in cui l’esperienza
tattile diviene primaria e indicatrice delle varie facce della manifestazione
cui è legato; di 120 pagine auto copertinate, 500 copie e tre tipi di carte; un
dialogo armonioso tra immagini (fotografia di Alessandro Zangirolami) e parole
(testi di Eleonora Raspi e Pietro Gaglianò).</p>
<p>Per noi questo <b>catalogo </b>non è solo
la documentazione di quello che è stato, ma un simbolo concreto di quello che
siamo riusciti a fare in un territorio inaspettato e non scontato. È il primo
passo, soprattutto, verso quello che vogliamo fare in futuro e della direzione
che la manifestazione vuole prendere.</p>
<p><b>IL VOSTRO AIUTO</b></p>
<p>Per la realizzazione del catalogo stiamo impiegando
molto tempo ed energie, e ci affidiamo al contributo economico della stessa Pro
Loco, Accademia Libera e degli abitanti del territorio. Per la prima volta da
quando esiste la manifestazione e proprio per l’unicità di questa edizione,
abbiamo deciso di attivare anche una campagna di crowdfunding, al fine di
completare la raccolta e raggiungere il budget necessario.</p>
<p>Il crowdfunding ci permetterà di sostenere i
seguenti costi:</p>
<p>- parziale copertura dei costi di stampa</p>
<p>- spese per la revisione dei testi</p>
<p>- spese per la campagna di lancio del
catalogo e gli eventi a questa collegati</p>
<p><b><i>PERKS</i></b><b> AD
HOC PER LA CAMPAGNA</b></p>
<p>Abbracciando in pieno lo spirito corale del
catalogo, alcuni degli artisti partecipanti si sono offerti di realizzare delle
edizioni limitate - legate alle opere realizzate durante M'arte - da offrire
come <i>perks </i>per le donazioni. Due degli artisti mettono a
disposizione opere originali.</p>
<p>La quota associata ad ogni <i>perk </i>non
rispecchia il valore reale delle opere, sia edizioni limitate che pezzi unici, quindi OGNI <i>perk </i>è un
autentico DEAL da non perdere!</p>
<p>(Vedi versione Inglese per dettagli ed immagini)</p>

My name is Eleonora and I am the curator of the V edition of the art project/exhibition Montegemoli Arte, M’ARTE 2015 | habitat, habitus, humus, held in June 2015 in the medieval hamlet of Montegemoli (province of Pisa, Tuscany) and organized by Pro Loco Montegemoli and Accademia Libera Natura e Cultura del Castello di Querceto.M’arte 2015 has been a vision and a ""gamble"", and yet it has been able to activate an inner transformation of the perception of contemporary art within the territory; to establish a tight dialogue with the people and local realities; and to build a high-profile contemporary art event.On behalf of all the people who entirely dedicated themselves to the event, I ask you to support its unique CATALOGUE, designed by the amazing graphic design studio LA TIGRE, Milan. Website: http://latigre.net/Before: M’ARTE 2015 ART RESIDENCYM’arte 2015 has been a CHORAL SYMPHONY and a COHERENT FLOW of creative ENERGIES and SENTIMENT.Check-out our FB page https://www.facebook.com/Marte-Montegemoli-Arte-985486048137848/WHAT? Residency programme for artists and art professionals, site-specific installations, groups shows, performances, workshops and talks; WHEN? From 3 to 15 June 2015, after almost a year of preparation WHERE? In the area of the Alta Val di Cecina (Pisa), specifically across the village of Montegemoli, the town of Pomarance, the hamlet Castello Ginori-Lisci di Querceto, and the city of Volterra. **And, above all, WHO? The artists connected to the art collective SITE SPECIFIC (Scicli, Ragusa), such as Claudio Cavallaro, Maria Grazia Galesi, Sebastiano Mortellaro, Francesco Rinzivillo, Piero Roccasalvo Rub and Sasha Vinci; and the internationally renowned artists Isabella e Tiziana Pers, co-founders of RAVE EAST VILLAGE ARTIST RESIDENCY (Trivignano Udinese, Udine). A poolof creative professionals: independent critic/curator Pietro Gaglianò, filmmakers/photographers Malia Bruker and Alessandro Zangirolami, videomaker/choreographer J. Louise Makary and graphic designers Luisa Milani and Walter Molteni (La Tigre).** The success of the event is also due to the many collateral events happened during M’arte: SITE SPECIFIC, in collaboration with C.A.R.M.A., presented ORACULUM, an international video art archive, and for the first time it used the online platform Videoform, curated by Laurent Delaye and Clare Bradley (London). The selected video artists, by Veronica D'Auria and Maurizio Marco Tozzi, have been: Alessandro Amaducci, Alessandro Bavari, Piero Chiariello, Valeria Del Vacchio, Elisabetta Di Sopra, Francesca Fini, Maria Korporal, Igor Imhoff, Salvatore Insana, Eleonora Manca, Pinina Podestà, Arash Radpour, Mauro Rescigno, Lino Strangis.M'Arte organized laboratories with the historical Liceo Artistico G. Carducci di Volterra and students’ sculpture exhibition; workshops with the students of dell’Istituto Comprensorio Tabarrini di Pomarance; educational activities for families by PAP Aia Meccanica (Montegemoli); concerts by Volterra Jazz (Volterra) and I Favolosi (Volterra); electronic music performance by 20 degrees of frost (Brescia); live theatre/dance piece by Officine Papage (Pomarance).Now: M’ARTE 2015 ART CATALOGUEWe are working on a catalogue that shows the dynamism of the M’arte residency, the solidity of the group and the personal and professional effort employed in the event. For this reason, the catalogue is entirely designed by Luisa Milani and Walter Molteni (La Tigre). Two video documentaries – Malia Bruker’s and Alessandro Zangirolami’s – complete the editorial project.Matter is – first of all – the element that lies at the basis of the creative idea of the two graphic designers. This is a catalogue in which the diversified tactile experiences mirror the many facets of the event; 120 pages, 500 copies and three types of paper; a harmonious dialogue between images (photographs by Alessandro Zangirolami) and words (texts by Eleonora Raspi e Pietro Gaglianò)For us, this catalogue is more than just a documentation of the past, but rather a tangible symbol of what we have been able to achieve in a challenging territory. Most of all, THIS IS THE FIRST STEP TOWARDS THE FUTURE OF OUR EVENT.YOUR HELP!We are putting all of ourselves into this publication, and we rely on limited financial support from Pro Loco, Accademia Libera and local community. For the first time since the creation of M’arte, and because of the uniqueness of this year's edition, we have decided to start a crowdfunding campaign to reach the necessary budget and finally complete the catalogue.Your PRECIOUS help will allow us to sustain the following costs:- publication costs (partially)- proof reading and editing services costs- communication and promotional eventsAD HOC ARTWORKS TO FUND THE CAMPAIGNAccording to the choral spirit of the catalogue, some of the invited artists have offered to produce one artwork – prints, serigraphs, photos – to be given as perks for the donations. Two of them donated original artworks.The amount associate to each perk does not mirror the effective value of the artwork itself (which is much higher!!!!), so this also a great deal!50 EUROMadri/Mothers, Isabella and Tiziana Pers, print on matte paper 350gsm, 14,8 x 21 cm, edition 50, signed and numbered, 2015Madri/Mothers, Isabella e Tiziana Pers, stampa su carta patinata opaca 350gsm, 14,8 x 21 cm, edizione 50, firmata e numerata, 2015 80 EURO (each, to choose between 4 images)Handcart/resurrection, Claudio Cavallaro, handprint puntasecca, with touches of fluorescent paint, 20 x 15 cm, edition 20, signed and numbered, 2015 (reference image)Handcart/resurrection, Claudio Cavallaro, incisione puntasecca con ritocchi di pigmento fosforescente, 20 x 15 cm, edizione 20, firmata e numerata, 2015 (immagine reference)100 EUROHandcart/resurrection, Claudio Cavallaro, handprint puntasecca black tip, with touches of fluorescent paint, 30 x 20 cm, edition 20, signed and numbered, 2015 (reference image)Handcart/resurrection, Claudio Cavallaro, incisione puntasecca a punta nera con ritocchi di pigmento fluorescente, 30 x 20 cm, edizione 20, firmata e numerata, 2015 (immagine reference)150 EURO (series of 3)Gemma, Sebastiano Mortellaro, series of 3 prints on white matte paper 350gsm, 20 x 30 cm, edition 5, signed and numbered, 2015Gemma, Sebastiano Mortellaro, serie di 3 stampe su carta bianca opaca 350gsm, 20 x 30 cm, edizione 5, firmata e numerata, 2015400 EURO (each)Senza Titolo 7, Francesco Rinzivillo, mixed media on paper, 15 x 15 cm, 2015Senza Titolo 7, Francesco Rinzivillo, tecnica mista su carta, 15 x 15 cm, 2015People var.2, Francesco Rinzivillo,  mixed media on cardboard, 28.6 x 20 cm, 2015People var.2, Francesco Rinzivillo,  tecnica mista su cartone, 28.6 x 20 cm, 2015800 EUROFace #1, Piero Roccasalvo RUB, mixed media on cardboard, 25,5 x 36 cm, 2014Face #1, Piero Roccasalvo RUB, tecnica mista su cartoncino, 25,5 x 36 cm, 2014Face #2, Piero Roccasalvo RUB, mixed media on cardboard, 25,5 x 36 cm, 2014Face #2, Piero Roccasalvo RUB, tecnica mista su cartoncino, 25,5 x 36 cm, 2014--> In addition to the rewards above, there are a series of perks for smaller (but equally important for us!!!!) donations, made by our photographer Alessandro Zangirolami and the graphic design studio La Tigre.10 EURO1 postcard from a 10 piece series: printed on white rough paper 600gsm, 14.8 x 10.5 cm.

UN CATALOGO D’AUTORE
sostieni il progetto e regalati un’edizione
limitata e/o un pezzo unico 
Io sono Eleonora, curatrice della V edizione della
manifestazione di arte contemporanea Montegemoli
Arte, M’ARTE 2015 | habitat, habitus, humus, tenutasi a giugno 2015
nell’omonimo paese in provincia di Pisa, organizzato da Pro Loco di Montegemoli
e Accademia Libera Natura e Cultura del Castello di Querceto.
Una visione, una scommessa contro
ogni tipo di ostacolo, che è riuscita ad innescare un principio di
cambiamento nel territorio, a dialogare in maniera
stretta con i suoi abitanti e a realizzare un evento di arte contemporanea
ad alto potenziale.
A nome di tutte le persone che donano e hanno
donato loro stesse all’evento, vi chiedo di sostenere il progetto del CATALOGO
di M'ARTE 2015, realizzato ad hoc dallo studio grafico LA TIGRE di
Milano. Sito: http://latigre.net/
Prima: LA RESIDENZA M’ARTE 2015
Un’esperienza CORALE, una COMPATTEZZA di sentimento
ed energie, un insieme di MERAVIGLIE.
Date un’occhiata alla nostra pagina FB https://www.facebook.com/Marte-Montegemoli-Arte-985486048137848/
CHE COSA?** Percorso
di residenza per artisti e creativi, installazioni, mostre, performancee
conferenze QUANDO? Dal 3 al 15 giugno 2015, dopo quasi
un anno di lavoro di preparazione. DOVE? siti più
suggestivi dell’Alta Val di Cecina, in provincia di Pisa: borgo e castello di
Montegemoli, paese di Pomarance, Castello Ginori-Lisci di Querceto, e città di
Volterra.
E soprattutto CHI? artisti legati al collettivo SITE SPECIFIC (Scicli,
Ragusa) e nello specifico: Claudio Cavallaro, Maria Grazia Galesi,

VILLAGE ARTIST RESIDENCY (Trivignano Udinese, Udine).I creativi: il
critico/curatore indipendente Pietro Gaglianò, i
registi/fotografi Malia Bruker e Alessandro
Zangirolami, la coreografa/videomaker J. Louise Makary e i
graphic designers Luisa Milani e Walter Molteni (La
Tigre).
** L’unicità e il successo della manifestazione
sono dovuti anche grazie alla presenza di eventi collaterali, quali: SITE
SPECIFIC, in collaborazione con C.A.R.M.A., ha presentato ORACULUM,
un archivio di video arte internazionale tramite la piattaforma Videoform,
a cura di Laurent Delaye e Clare Bradley. Gli
artisti audiovisivi selezionati da Veronica D'Auria e Maurizio Marco Tozzi

Tabarrini (Pomarance); mostra di scultura degli studenti del Liceo
Carducci; servizi educativi a cura di PAP Aia Meccanica (Montegemoli);
Concerti di Volterra Jazz (Volterra) e I Favolosi (Volterra);
performance live del gruppo di musica elettronica 20 degrees of frost (Brescia);
performance di teatro/danza dell'associazione Officine Papage (Pomarance). 
Adesso: IL CATALOGO M’ARTE 2015
Stiamo lavorando per un catalogo che esprima il
senso di work-in-progress della residenza stessa di M’arte 2015, che nasca
dall’interno e che rispecchi la compattezza di gruppo e l’energia impiegata
nella manifestazione. Per questo è curato interamente e gratuitamente dai
grafici dello studio La Tigre, a loro volta creativi in residenza.
Il tutto completato da due video/documentari, uno realizzato da Malia Bruker
sull’esperienza della residenza e uno realizzato da Alessandro Zangirolami
sulla performance urbana degli artisti Sasha Vinci e Maria Grazia Galesi.
La materia – prima di tutto – è quello che si trova
alla base dell’idea creativa dei grafici. Un catalogo in cui l’esperienza
tattile diviene primaria e indicatrice delle varie facce della manifestazione
cui è legato; di 120 pagine auto copertinate, 500 copie e tre tipi di carte; un
dialogo armonioso tra immagini (fotografia di Alessandro Zangirolami) e parole
(testi di Eleonora Raspi e Pietro Gaglianò).
Per noi questo catalogo non è solo
la documentazione di quello che è stato, ma un simbolo concreto di quello che
siamo riusciti a fare in un territorio inaspettato e non scontato. È il primo
passo, soprattutto, verso quello che vogliamo fare in futuro e della direzione
che la manifestazione vuole prendere.
IL VOSTRO AIUTO
Per la realizzazione del catalogo stiamo impiegando
molto tempo ed energie, e ci affidiamo al contributo economico della stessa Pro
Loco, Accademia Libera e degli abitanti del territorio. Per la prima volta da
quando esiste la manifestazione e proprio per l’unicità di questa edizione,
abbiamo deciso di attivare anche una campagna di crowdfunding, al fine di
completare la raccolta e raggiungere il budget necessario.
Il crowdfunding ci permetterà di sostenere i
seguenti costi:
- parziale copertura dei costi di stampa
- spese per la revisione dei testi
- spese per la campagna di lancio del
catalogo e gli eventi a questa collegati
PERKS AD
HOC PER LA CAMPAGNA
Abbracciando in pieno lo spirito corale del
catalogo, alcuni degli artisti partecipanti si sono offerti di realizzare delle
edizioni limitate - legate alle opere realizzate durante M'arte - da offrire
come perks per le donazioni. Due degli artisti mettono a
disposizione opere originali.
La quota associata ad ogni perk non
rispecchia il valore reale delle opere, sia edizioni limitate che pezzi unici, quindi OGNI perk è un
autentico DEAL da non perdere!

<h3><strong>The Ancestor Project</strong></h3>
<p>This may be one of the most exciting opportunities of my life. For the past year and a half, I have dedicated myself to the reclamation of my African American ancestral memory and the expression of my vision as an African diaspora artist. I have immersed in my own familial histories and those of African American slave descendants across the continent. I have undertaken DNA testing that traced my blood heritage through enslavement in North Carolina to the Mende people in Northern Sierra Leone. Utilizing oil painting, sculpture, performance, mixed-media, film, and writing I have begun the path of making it my life's work to create interdisciplinary art and ritual based in the reclamation and honoring of ancestral voices.</p>
<p>This summer I have been invited by the international artist and cultural activist Kwame Akoto-Bamfo, to join him and other African and African diaspora artists to take part in a historic large-scale sculptural monument to African Heritage, History, and Resilience in Ghana.</p>
<p>Please watch the video below to get a better idea of the project from Kwame himself.</p>

<p>©Kwame Acoto Bamfo</p>
<p>Since this video was made, the project has gained considerable momentum, over 1000 more heads have been sculpted and the project has grown in its community outreach. This August, Kwame will be hosting an inaugural biennial festival celebrating the Nkyinkyim installation and the Ancestors project as a whole. I have been invited to do a <strong>4 week Residency at the Osramba Studios working directly with Kwame and other participating artists</strong>. I will learn new techniques, engage directly within the working of the studio and participate in the community events, workshops, teachings and cultural exchange.</p>

<h3>What do I need to be able to go:</h3>
<p>This invitation is a huge honor. It feels like everything I have been doing in these last years has led me to this opportunity. It has not been easy being a single mom of two teenage boys, working full time, and being enrolled full time in school myself. I have never worked so hard in my life to live into my truth as an artist. This chance is a dream for me. To not only work directly with a sculptor and artist I admire, but to learn traditional African art practices, to be directly engaged with local African community, and to reconnect the ancestral lines that I have been carrying, back to the African soil from which many of them came. It is a lifelong dream to walk on that earth and to share in that spirit.</p>
<p>In order to go however, I will need help. Just to cover the basic costs. Here is the breakdown of what i will need to cover:</p>
<p><strong>Base Costs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Round Trip Airfare from Albuquerque to Ghana ~$1900</li>
<li>Transportation in and around Ghana ~$600</li>
<li>4 weeks Accommodation (includes living space, food, studio space, materials, and basic living costs):~$1500</li>
<li>Taxes, Visa Fees, Inoculation fees, and Incidentals:~$1000</li>
<li>Total: $5000</li>
</ul>
<p>I am asking for donations in any amount towards the actualization of this dream. I have constructed multiple tiers of donations and Individual perks for those of you that want to join me on this journey. I will be making regular video updates and sharing the entire process with my supporters, as well as creating one of a kind works for those of you supporting at the higher tiers.</p>
<h3>
<strong>Wa</strong><strong>ys your support will help me now and in the future</strong>
</h3>
<p>Through this residency opportunity I will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Work directly with the Lead artist Kwame Akoto Bamfo and other participating African and African Diaspora Artists from around the world on a historic African Heritage Monument in Ghana.</li>
<li>Learn Traditional and Contemporary sculpture techniques and practices in an intensive 4 week residency.</li>
<li>Collaborate with other artists, educators and activists engaged in cultural reparations and direct engagement practices</li>
<li>Experience a deep sense of return and renewal as I learn African cultural ritual, tradition and practices directly from Ghanaian elders and community members.</li>
<li>Return home with an enriched artistic practice, spirit and direction for all the new work to come in this next year.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What this means to me</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Your support in this project will make it possible. The experience I will have there will be no less than life changing and career altering. I can only imagine the works that will be inspired in me as I am able to work in the air and earth of those ancestral souls that have been carrying me this far. Your belief in me and the work I am making has already shown itself to be more powerful than any of us could have imagined.</p>
<p>In my first two years of dedicating myself to expressing these ancestral voices I have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Completed a Solo Museum show at the Harwood Museum in New Mexico, featuring 7 large scale oil paintings of Ancestors through time (all of which sold)</li>
<li>Created 108 life size hand carved Death Masks to honor the countless untold stories in my bloodlines. The installation of which won the Contemporary Black Arts Award and the Juried Grand Prize for 3D sculptural installation at ArtPrize 2018.</li>
<li>Featured a Large Scale Mixed media work, dedicated to the reclamation and sacrality of the Femme Body, at The MOCADA Museum of Contemporary African Diaspora Arts in Brooklyn.</li>
<li>Developed a Performance Art piece dedicated to physical rituals of remembering and healing the lost and broken bodies of black brown and indigenous ancestors.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your support has made all of this happen. I could not do it without you. The opportunity to go to Africa and to work in the center of what I love and what is calling me, is no less than grace itself. Any amount that you can give to make this happen will make sure that i continue to do this work, continue this education and recovery and to share it with the world.</p>

<h2>Liz Kow, Live Artist </h2>
<p>I am Liz Kow, a Live Artist based in Singapore. I want to use the medium of Live Art to explore how humans perceive and react to rules in my performances, within the context of various cultural, social, and political themes.</p>
<p>I started creating solo Live Art performances in 2016, while I was still studying at Goldsmiths College, University of London where I graduated with a BA(hons) Drama and Theatre Arts. My debut performance was called <i>Jiak Kan Tang</i>, which explored cultural hybridity between Singapore and the United Kingdom. That performance involved a 30 minute movement choreography, lots of potatoes, and lots of rice. </p>
<p><i>Method Hominid  </i>would be my fourth performance, and it was initially created and performed in London in 2017. I am performing it again in Singapore because I believe that local audiences here would appreciate a participative performance-experiment that explores how individuals exercise power. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>What happens during <i>Method Hominid</i>?</h2>
<p>The audience will have the option of entering two different rooms - the Control Room, or the Experiment Room. </p>
<p>In the Control Room there will be a large desk with two TV monitors on it, and these will display a video feed from two different angles of the Experiment Room. There will be a microphone on the table, a large sheet containing instructions, a piece of paper listing the items in the Experiment Room, a blank notepad, and a pen. A simple desk chair will be in front of the table, for audience members to sit on. In the Control Room the audience is able to give instructions to the artist (i.e. me) through the microphone, and this will be transmitted into a wireless earpiece that she is wearing. They will be able to see the artist perform their instructions through the TV monitors and observe the resulting reactions of the audience members in the Experiment Room.</p>
<p>The artist will be in the Experiment Room which is bare except for the items as per the list in the Control Room, scattered around the room. The audiences in this room are invited to use the items on the artist, as long as they do not mortally harm themselves, other audience members, or the artist. The audience in this room are not allowed to give instructions to the artist, or know what instructions are being told to the artist from the audience members in the Control Room.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>How much power do you want? </h2>
<p>For the 2019 iteration of <i>Method Hominid</i> the project will be more focussed on exploring power and how people exercise it. It extends to also focus on promoting discussion on Live Art as a genre of art making, and how it can be used as a tool for social change and inspiring personal agency.</p>
<p>Due to the  participative nature of the performance, it is very audience-centric - it puts them at the forefront of theirs and the artist’s impressions of their own identity and the identity of others. Whether the audience reacts in extreme ways towards the artist, and even if they do not, it is an indication of how they respond to being in a position of power or how they respond to others who have power over them. </p>
<p>Live art has always treaded the thin border between theatrical performance and social experimentation – within the history of this performance genre artists such as Marina Abramovic and Yoko Ono come to mind, whose works invite audiences to engage with the artist in order to consider their morals and ethics. Many of their works involve a degree of audience participation, some of which go to such lengths that they could be perceived as social experiments. <i>Method Hominid</i> is a performance-experiment inspired by the works and practices of Abramovic and Ono, and based on the concept of the Social Learning Theory established by Alfred Bandura.</p>
<p>In Singapore, the genre of Live Art has gone through a short period of decline, which I believe is partly due to the years where it received an increase in negative public press during the 1990s. Therefore staging <i>Method Hominid</i> is critical in giving the genre more visibility and accessibility to a new generation of artists and audiences, to continue learning about and expanding the knowledge of how Live Art is practiced in Singapore. </p>
<p>To uncover how the genre has continued to survive in Singapore despite its diminished exposure, a documentary film will be made about the creative process of <i>Method Hominid</i> in parallel with the practice of Live Art in Singapore. Film is a medium that allows sharing knowledge and experiences to a wide range of audiences at various scales, from small classrooms to large auditoriums, which would encourage an interest in Live Arts for as long as the film continues to be shared. Film is also a medium that is highly accessible to all, and provides an alternative mode for storytelling which is essential for a story about the complicated and compelling practice of Live Art in Singapore. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>When and where</h3>
<p><i>Method Hominid  </i>will take place at the Substation Gallery in Singapore, on the following dates:<br/><br/>26th April 2019: 7pm - 10pm</p>
<p>27th April 2019: 7pm - 10pm</p>
<p>28th April 2019: 3pm - 6pm, post-performance presentation 6.30pm - 7.30pm</p>
<p>The documentary will begin production in April 2019, with a targeted release in October 2019. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Keep me going until the end </h3>

<p>The funds that are raised through this Indiegogo campaign will enable me to cover costs for:</p>

<li>
<strong>Food and transportation for the entire <i>Method Hominid</i> Team</strong> USD 200</li>
<li>

<p>All of this would amount to USD 23,850. Through indiegogo I am hoping to raise USD 10,000 to acquire some initial funds to get the ball rolling on this project an cover initial costs. As such I am continuing to look for other avenues to fund the remaining USD 13,850 either in the form of grants, direct funding, or in-kind sponsorships.</p>

<h3>The what ifs...</h3>
<p>Many people might think that what I am doing is crazy and that most will not understand enough to be interested in <i>Method Hominid</i>. I hope that with this project, I can change this. I want to show to more people that Live Art is important to us as a society, to give us space and time to reflect on who we are. To practice mindfulness, openness, and a non-judgemental demeanour. </p>
<p>My biggest fear is people will think that <i>Method Hominid </i>is not worth a place in the Singaporean art and performance landscape, and will prevent others from supporting it. Nonetheless I hope that you who are reading this will give me and the project a chance, and give it the wings to expand the horizons of art-making in Singapore. </p>

Social circus and music training emphasizes gender equality, teamwork, respect, and non-violent communication.<br/>Tuesday through Friday, over 200 at-risk youth attend free classes in a safe and positive environment where they can grow and acquire skills needed to face adverse situations in creative and resilient ways, enabling them to break the cycles of poverty prevalent in Bolivia, because of the lack of education and alternatives educational projects.<br/>As the youth explain in the video, PLI is their family! PLI offers training in Social Circus, Music, Socio-Educational support, and integrated health programs. Because many at-risk youth must work on the streets just to feed themselves, we employ local mothers to provide a free healthy meal after each class.</p><p>Since the first class in 2006 with only six kids in a park, we have helped over 3,000 youth and family members from low-resource communities to find positive educational and economic opportunities in safe places where they can create better futures through the arts. </p><p>We are proud to share with you the news that PLI was selected by the United Nations General Assembly “2019 Youth Solutions Report” as one of the most creative solutions for meeting youth development goals. 50 youth-led organizations from around the world were recognized by the UN report as programs that are meeting youth millennium goals. <a href=""http://www.youthsolutions.report/2019report"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.youthsolutions.report/2019report</a> </p><p>We hope you will join Performing Life in continuing to serve the youth of Bolivia.</p><p>Our two Social Circus centers provide free services in low-income indigenous communities in Montenegro and Alto Buena Vista, while Music for All serves youth from orphanages and group homes in the City of Cochabamba.<br/>This year, over 200 children benefit from our free programs; 150 in Social Circus classes, and 50 in Music classes.</p><p>We are requesting your assistance to improve the conditions in our centers, to more effectively serve the youth and welcome others who want to participate. But, first we must solve very serious challenges in our centers. We need shade structures for circus practice areas, because the sun is so strong.

Social circus and music training emphasizes gender equality, teamwork, respect, and non-violent communication.Tuesday through Friday, over 200 at-risk youth attend free classes in a safe and positive environment where they can grow and acquire skills needed to face adverse situations in creative and resilient ways, enabling them to break the cycles of poverty prevalent in Bolivia, because of the lack of education and alternatives educational projects.As the youth explain in the video, PLI is their family! PLI offers training in Social Circus, Music, Socio-Educational support, and integrated health programs. Because many at-risk youth must work on the streets just to feed themselves, we employ local mothers to provide a free healthy meal after each class.Since the first class in 2006 with only six kids in a park, we have helped over 3,000 youth and family members from low-resource communities to find positive educational and economic opportunities in safe places where they can create better futures through the arts. We are proud to share with you the news that PLI was selected by the United Nations General Assembly “2019 Youth Solutions Report” as one of the most creative solutions for meeting youth development goals. 50 youth-led organizations from around the world were recognized by the UN report as programs that are meeting youth millennium goals. http://www.youthsolutions.report/2019report We hope you will join Performing Life in continuing to serve the youth of Bolivia.Our two Social Circus centers provide free services in low-income indigenous communities in Montenegro and Alto Buena Vista, while Music for All serves youth from orphanages and group homes in the City of Cochabamba.This year, over 200 children benefit from our free programs; 150 in Social Circus classes, and 50 in Music classes.We are requesting your assistance to improve the conditions in our centers, to more effectively serve the youth and welcome others who want to participate. But, first we must solve very serious challenges in our centers. We need shade structures for circus practice areas, because the sun is so strong. Bathrooms in the centers are in urgent need of repair. We must address the lack of wash water in Buena Vista. The music studio needs instrument repairs and the youth need help with fares for public transportation to attend classes.Your thoughtful support for improving conditions in the centers will encourage our family of youth, workers and volunteers, because they will be able to focus on practicing in safe and healthy environments, and more youth can join the PLI family.With your support we are going to be able to:-Fix the bathrooms-Build a shade structure for our centers-Repair and renovate our circus materials and music instruments.-implement a maintenance plan and budget for all the centers.Know more about Performing Life https://performinglifebolivia.org/Thank You!SpanishPerforming Life International /Fundación EnseñARTE Bolivia, usa el Circo social y la música como herramientas de intervención para crear un ambiente donde los niños, niñas y jóvenes Bolivianos puedan mejorar su autoestima, sus conductas resilientes, sus habilidades sociales y experimentar los resultados del esfuerzo propio para alcanzar sus metas.Las prácticas de Circo social y música enfatizan la igualdad de género, el trabajo en equipo, el respeto y una comunicación libre de violencia.De martes a viernes más de 200 niños en situación de riesgo, participan de clases gratuitas en un ambiente seguro, donde pueden crear y fortalecer aptitudes necesarias para afrontar las situaciones adversas de una manera creativa y resiliente, posibilitando que estos jóvenes puedan romper los círculos de pobreza que prevalecen en Bolivia, debido a la falta de educación y programas educacionales alternativos.Como los niños explican en el video PLI es su familia!PLI ofrece clases de Circo social, Musica, apoyo Socioeducativo y programas de salud integral, porque muchos niños y jóvenes en situación de riesgo, deben trabajar en las calles, a veces tan solo para alimentarse.

<ul>
<li>We are 11 art students from around the world: the
     UK, the USA, Spain, Oman, and Mauritus all finishing a three year
     award winning online MFA with the Open College for the Arts. </li>
<li>We have never met each other in person as we have
     spent the three years of our course meeting in google hangouts. It is very
     important to us to set up a great MFA show but we need some help because
     we have the added cost of travel and posting our work to the UK where our
     exhibition will be held. </li>
<li>By contributing to this crowd funding you will
     help us to pay for our exhibition expenses and create a professional, first
     class show that we can be proud of. </li>
</ul>
<p><b>What We Need &amp;
What You Get</b></p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>We need to fund
the typical costs of setting up a group show; the catalogue, publicity, and
private view catering (which may well be crisps and wine from the supermarket)
plus the costs of sending and returning work from overseas. Some of us are
coming from as far away as Mauritius! </p>
<ul>
<li>In return for your contribution you will receive a limited edition postcard of a piece of work
     from the show or you can purchase a piece of original art by one of the artists in the show.</li>
<li>Our main aim is to reduce personal costs for each
     student, we are already paying for travel and accommodation to the venue
     and the time we will spend setting up and in some cases taking down the work again.
     If we don’t make our target at the very least we would like to pay for the
     printing of our catalogue as it would make a treasured memento of this time
     in our lives.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Our MFA is so inclusive and liberating for creative people who, for whatever reason, don't have access to study at a univsersity in person. Among our cohort there are students with families and small children, and this course has given them the opportunity to continue their studies without causing a disruption to their lives. By supporting this exhibition you will help us to begin the next stage of our careers as artists in style and alleviate the high costs involved. </li>
<li>My name is Judith Farr and I have had a really
     positive experience with crowd funding in the past. A few years back in 2013, I crowd funded to raise money to refurbish my studio so that I could commence my
     MFA in style, and it has been wonderful to use my newly kitted out studio
     throughout this course. </li>
<li>I truly believe that we deserve to have a quality
     MFA show! Despite the fact that we are a little unusual in that we are an online course, we have become very close over the years and
     supported eachothers work albeit from afar. </li>
</ul>
<p><b>Risks &amp;
Challenges</b></p>
<p></p><p>The main risk involved with supporting this campaign is
that we don’t know when you might receive your perk because we are still trying
to finish all our MA work. But, as there is a group of us working on the
project we will make sure that each contributor receives his or her perk, be it
a postcard, selection of postcards or an original piece of artwork. </p>

Italian deck that was as yet unpublished in the modern era.</b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;""> </span></p><p>Something not too
far from the model that gave rise to the 18th century iconic illustrations of
the so-called <i>Tarot of Marseilles</i>; well-known
to enthusiasts, (and consequently to a large degree influential over decks
published during subsequent centuries).</p>
<p>This choice went to the 17th century exemplary Bolognese deck of
cards known as the ‘Fine della Torre’, which fortunately was passed down to us
nearly complete and in fairly good condition. The only known example is
preserved as “Tarot bolonais XVIIe s.” by the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris
(Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris, Estampes, KH 34 rés. boit 1, cf. cat. “Tarot,
jeu et magie” n° 26 B.N. 1984. Nomenclature IPCS: IT-2.)</p>
<p>The original card size was
105 x 43 mm. (4.1” x 1.7”) and the Trumps were printed unnumbered although
became numbered by hand afterwards.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>In the new edition the card
size is 6 x 14 cm. (2.4” by 5.5”)</b></p>
<p>At the time of production,
being a Bolognese style deck meant it would be reduced from the traditional
Tarot deck of seventy-eight to sixty-two cards; eliminating the Minor Arcana
numbered: 2, 3, 4 and 5 of each suit, (following the custom in vogue in Bologna
since at least the mid-16th century). Of the original sixty-two, only six cards
remain lost to time: 6, 7, 8 &amp; 9 of Swords, the Queen of Cups and Queen of
Coins.</p>
<p>It is a similar deck to
modern successors, such as the Tarocchino Bolognese, but at the same time has
many resemblances to its ancestors of the 16th century (with the notable
exception of the Devil card); at least with regards to the twelve surviving
images of Trumps on two incomplete sheets from the last decade of the 15th century.
The first is in the Bibliotheque de l'Ecole Nationale Superieure des
Beaux-Arts, Masson Collection, (uncataloged), Paris. The second is in the Musée
du Louvre, Rothschild Collection, LR 3804, Paris.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1462186800/dallo_0_al_5_f8rsos.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p><b>         CURIOSITY OVER THIS PRECIOUS DECK OF
TAROT CARDS</b></p>
<p>In this early Tarot deck
there are still traditional depictions of the High Priestess, Empress, Emperor
and Pope, that were viewed unfavorably by authorities of the Papal States, and
which were subsequently replaced in Tarocchino Bolognese; first by two Popes
and two Emperors (by at least 1669) and eventually by images of the four
""Moors"" during the late 17th century.</p>
<p>From the perspective of
symbolism, this deck shows extremely interesting details, particularly when
compared to the traditional portrayal of the cards.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1462186844/dal_6_al_11_b4nwp9.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 618px;height: 933px;background-color: initial;""/><br/></p><p></p><p>The High Priestess and Pope are the most remarkable cards of the Major Arcana. The High Priestess holds Keys and makes a blessing with a Latin gesture, while the Pope has a closed book and holds a cross. The latter also reveals stigmata on his hands, and has a youthful, beardless face that is decidedly feminine. The details of his Papal Tiara (a triple crown without button or cross) suggest a hypothetical design dating between 1342 and 1503.<br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1462380817/dal_12_al_17_coeyyb.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1462380864/dal_18_al_21_azrg27.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></p><p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">All face cards of the Major
Arcana are interesting from a historic and symbolic point of view, while the
Court Cards consistently reflect complementary qualities of courtly pairing in
an aesthetically pleasing manner.</span><br/></p>
<p>The distinction between male
suits (Wands and Swords) and female (Cups and Coins) is all too evident with
the obvious presence of two female chambermaids. However, in this regard, there
are many other significant details, such as the postures of these characters,
their attire, attributes and ageless appearance.<br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1462266120/10denari_pfcesu.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 192px;height: 446px;""/></p><br/>
<p>The 10 of Coins has the
inscription “CARTE FINE DALLA TORRE IN BOLOGNA” with 17th century typography.
These words are capitalized and displayed vertically. Most likely one of many
heirs of an abundant production of cards that was documented in Bologna with
the manufacturer Pietro Bonozzi since at least 1477, while their presence was
certified in town since at least 1459 (refer to the <i>Tarot Travel Guide of Italy</i>, 2015, page 50 by Morena Poltronieri,

<p>On the back of the cards are
two winged angels. One is the classic Cupid with bow and arrow, while the other
points to a large tree with a heart hanging like fruit. This is probably a
reference to the myth of Apollo and Daphne; both struck by arrows of Eros, but
with opposite results. Apollo fell in love with Daphne, while she flatly
refused his advances after a long chase through the woods. So as not to give
into the passions of the ‘God of Oracles', this nymph, prayed for an escape and
was thus transformed into the sweetly scented laurel plant, (Ovid, <i>Metamorphoses</i>, I, 452-567) known as
""Daphne"" in Greek and which consequently became the symbolic tribute
to great poets in Ancient Greece.</p>

                                           XVII Century Tarot of Bologna
      AFTER
400 YEARS A HISTORICAL TAROT DECK COMES BACK TO LIFEThe International Museum of Tarot sought to publish an ancient
Italian deck that was as yet unpublished in the modern era. Something not too
far from the model that gave rise to the 18th century iconic illustrations of
the so-called Tarot of Marseilles; well-known
to enthusiasts, (and consequently to a large degree influential over decks
published during subsequent centuries).
This choice went to the 17th century exemplary Bolognese deck of
cards known as the ‘Fine della Torre’, which fortunately was passed down to us
nearly complete and in fairly good condition. The only known example is
preserved as “Tarot bolonais XVIIe s.” by the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris
(Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris, Estampes, KH 34 rés. boit 1, cf. cat. “Tarot,
jeu et magie” n° 26 B.N. 1984. Nomenclature IPCS: IT-2.)
The original card size was
105 x 43 mm. (4.1” x 1.7”) and the Trumps were printed unnumbered although
became numbered by hand afterwards.
In the new edition the card
size is 6 x 14 cm. (2.4” by 5.5”)
At the time of production,
being a Bolognese style deck meant it would be reduced from the traditional
Tarot deck of seventy-eight to sixty-two cards; eliminating the Minor Arcana
numbered: 2, 3, 4 and 5 of each suit, (following the custom in vogue in Bologna
since at least the mid-16th century). Of the original sixty-two, only six cards
remain lost to time: 6, 7, 8 & 9 of Swords, the Queen of Cups and Queen of
Coins.
It is a similar deck to
modern successors, such as the Tarocchino Bolognese, but at the same time has
many resemblances to its ancestors of the 16th century (with the notable
exception of the Devil card); at least with regards to the twelve surviving
images of Trumps on two incomplete sheets from the last decade of the 15th century.
The first is in the Bibliotheque de l'Ecole Nationale Superieure des
Beaux-Arts, Masson Collection, (uncataloged), Paris. The second is in the Musée
du Louvre, Rothschild Collection, LR 3804, Paris.         CURIOSITY OVER THIS PRECIOUS DECK OF
TAROT CARDS
In this early Tarot deck
there are still traditional depictions of the High Priestess, Empress, Emperor
and Pope, that were viewed unfavorably by authorities of the Papal States, and
which were subsequently replaced in Tarocchino Bolognese; first by two Popes
and two Emperors (by at least 1669) and eventually by images of the four
""Moors"" during the late 17th century.
From the perspective of
symbolism, this deck shows extremely interesting details, particularly when
compared to the traditional portrayal of the cards.
The High Priestess and Pope are the most remarkable cards of the Major Arcana. The High Priestess holds Keys and makes a blessing with a Latin gesture, while the Pope has a closed book and holds a cross. The latter also reveals stigmata on his hands, and has a youthful, beardless face that is decidedly feminine. The details of his Papal Tiara (a triple crown without button or cross) suggest a hypothetical design dating between 1342 and 1503.All face cards of the Major
Arcana are interesting from a historic and symbolic point of view, while the
Court Cards consistently reflect complementary qualities of courtly pairing in
an aesthetically pleasing manner.
The distinction between male
suits (Wands and Swords) and female (Cups and Coins) is all too evident with
the obvious presence of two female chambermaids. However, in this regard, there
are many other significant details, such as the postures of these characters,
their attire, attributes and ageless appearance.
The 10 of Coins has the
inscription “CARTE FINE DALLA TORRE IN BOLOGNA” with 17th century typography.
These words are capitalized and displayed vertically. Most likely one of many
heirs of an abundant production of cards that was documented in Bologna with
the manufacturer Pietro Bonozzi since at least 1477, while their presence was
certified in town since at least 1459 (refer to the Tarot Travel Guide of Italy, 2015, page 50 by Morena Poltronieri,
Ernesto Fazioli & Arnell Ando.)COURT CARDSWANDSCUPS

All activities are open to public, and the audience is encouraged to join and interact with artists, or being part of the art creation process.

Contemporary art, be it theory or practice, is not taught at schools, and young artists face a lot of hardship in studying contemporary art by themselves. Many young talents were missed out because of the poor working conditions, as well as capacity and skills constraints. Art spaces are also extremely limited for artists to work and exhibit.</p><p>The public in Hanoi also does not have many chances to enjoy contemporary art because of a limited number of art space dedicated to contemporary art. Through interactive workshops, open dialogues and exhibitions, we hope to bring art closer to the residents of Hanoi and over the long run, create and strengthen a local art community.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1475816098/q90obc2gewwbogutul9h.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><i>Art Talk by Kasia Klon, participating artist of 'Month of Arts Practice'  2016</i><i>.</i></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1475816495/iwpb2ome0pjv6eoa1drq.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><i>Workshop with artist George Burchett.</i></p><div class=""""><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/3DJ58WrOfaE?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div><h3><strong>HOW YOU CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE?</strong></h3><p>Thanks to the generosity of our main sponsor, we have enough funding to cover travel expenses, accommodation and art materials for the 12 featured artists.

<h3><strong>WHO'S BEHIND 'MONTH OF ARTS PRACTICE'?</strong></h3>
<p>Heritage Space is a non-profit arts organization supporting the development of local contemporary art, as well as creating meeting and cooperation opportunities of various creative fields.</p>
<p>Foundations &amp; organizations supporting culture and art in Vietnam are extremely rare, and there is almost no support for contemporary art. Local artists, therefore, have very little opportunity to discuss and work in professional environment, learn and discuss with specialists, creating their own network, thus encounter numerous difficulties for their long-term art career. Heritage Space was thus born to bridge this gap.</p>
<p>On the other hand, community activities such as talk, exhibition, workshops organized regularly at Heritage Space will help bring contemporary art closer to the public, raise interests, and in the future will be a source of long term patronage for art and artists.</p>

WHAT IS MONTH OF ARTS PRACTICE?‘Month of Arts Practice’ (HSMAP) is an ambitious art project of Heritage Space, an independent art space in Hanoi (Vietnam).HSMAP was initiated in 2015 in response to a great lack of educational and development opportunity for young artists in Vietnam. Every year, there will be established artists from overseas who are invited to come and work with Hanoi-based young, emerging, talented artists in a period of 4-6 weeks at Heritage Space. Apart from artwork creation by artists, a wide range of activities are organized such as workshops and presentations by artists, curators or specialists, film screening, musical performance and discussion, art visits or impromptu showcases. All activities are open to public, and the audience is encouraged to join and interact with artists, or being part of the art creation process. At the end of the project, all artworks are displayed for public’s appreciation.Artist in residence Isaac Cordal photographing his sculptures in Hanoi.Following the success of HSMAP 2015, this year's HSMAP came back with 5 established artists from Europe and America and 7 young emerging artists from Hanoi. Art dialogues and activities for the public have been heating up the art atmosphere in Hanoi more than ever. (For more information and updates, click here). There are in addition nearly 20 independent artists who volunteered to join in to exchange and create art, which reconfirms the desire to learn and communicate of artists in Hanoi.Last year's exhibition 'Brownian Movement', the Grand show of 'Month of Arts Practice' 2015 .HSMAP 2016 artists exchanging ideas.WHY IS HSMAP SO IMPORTANT TO US?The aim of the HSMAP project is twofold: we want to nurture and develop young Vietnamese talents through interaction with and learning from well-known international artists and enhance the art comprehension and appreciation amongst local residents.In Vietnam, until now, there has been no source of support for contemporary arts from the Government or Enterprises. Contemporary art, be it theory or practice, is not taught at schools, and young artists face a lot of hardship in studying contemporary art by themselves. Many young talents were missed out because of the poor working conditions, as well as capacity and skills constraints. Art spaces are also extremely limited for artists to work and exhibit.The public in Hanoi also does not have many chances to enjoy contemporary art because of a limited number of art space dedicated to contemporary art. Through interactive workshops, open dialogues and exhibitions, we hope to bring art closer to the residents of Hanoi and over the long run, create and strengthen a local art community.Art Talk by Kasia Klon, participating artist of 'Month of Arts Practice'  2016.Workshop with artist George Burchett.HOW YOU CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE?Thanks to the generosity of our main sponsor, we have enough funding to cover travel expenses, accommodation and art materials for the 12 featured artists. But in order to bring the amazing artworks realized during the project to the public, we need your help. Be part of it and help us create more chances for artists and create great art for Hanoi!We aim to raise another $8,500 which will allow us to:
Organize 02 important exhibitions at Heritage Space Gallery and Royal City Square in downtown Hanoi which cost $2,000
Publicate 500 books and brochures about the project for the period of 2015-2016 with works of more than 40 artists, which cost $4000
And support the materials for nearly 20 independent artists who volunteered to come exchange, work and create art for the exhibitions, which cost $2,500
We would appreciate each $5, $10, $50 from you because many smalls make a great. We believe with each of your support, even the slightest, will help us get there.

WHO'S BEHIND 'MONTH OF ARTS PRACTICE'?
Heritage Space is a non-profit arts organization supporting the development of local contemporary art, as well as creating meeting and cooperation opportunities of various creative fields.
Foundations & organizations supporting culture and art in Vietnam are extremely rare, and there is almost no support for contemporary art. Local artists, therefore, have very little opportunity to discuss and work in professional environment, learn and discuss with specialists, creating their own network, thus encounter numerous difficulties for their long-term art career. Heritage Space was thus born to bridge this gap.
On the other hand, community activities such as talk, exhibition, workshops organized regularly at Heritage Space will help bring contemporary art closer to the public, raise interests, and in the future will be a source of long term patronage for art and artists.

<h3><b><b>Summary</b></b></h3>
<h3><b><b></b></b></h3>
<p>Hello world! My name is Jillian, I am a dedicated art teacher and I am trying to raise the funds to build a studio for my amazing students at Pan African Academy and High School. Over the past two years, I have been developing and teaching an art program at a mission school in Kenya (Pan African). It began as an interesting opportunity I took in between my undergrad and teacher's college but it has grown into a project that has changed the course of my life. I have grown attached to these wonderful students who wasted no time at all in proving their talent, enthusiasm and commitment to me. </p>
<p>My fundraising goal is the estimated cost to have the studio built including both materials and labour. I am hoping that there will also be enough funds to furnish the room with some tables, stools and easels but we will cross that bridge when we get to it. Any extra funds raised will go into the account we have set up for the art program and will be used in the future to buy art supplies, tools and/or equipment. <br/></p>
<h3><b><b>A Little History</b></b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>I guess I should begin with how I got involved with Pan African Schools in the first place. It all began when I went to Kenya for a couple of weeks with a small group from the church I was attending at the time. While I was there, I met the director of PACE (Pan African Christian Exchange) Ministries. When he found out that I was going through for French and Art he says with a meaningful look, “Art? I don’t have an Art teacher” and in case I didn’t get the hint, he immediately follows up with “No wait, yes I do and she’s sitting right in front of me”. I didn’t know it at the time, but that moment was about to change the course of my life. </p>
<p>I mulled it over for a while and eventually decided to go teach art at PACE for a term between my undergrad and teacher’s college. I figured it would be an excellent experience, but I didn’t realize that it would change my life forever. I travelled back to Kenya in April 2014 and taught from May to August at Pan African Academy and Pan African High School. But you see, I did not anticipate how wonderful and talented the students would be, nor how much they would love and value the program. Before I knew it, I was convinced that I had to come back the following year and continue the program. So, when I finished teacher’s college in 2015, I returned and taught again for the same school term. As I watched my students grow and develop it became clear to me that I had started something much bigger than I had anticipated. Now, here I am, committed to continuing the program and trying to raise the funds to build a studio for these children who have stolen my heart. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b></b></p>
<h3><b><b>Why It’s Important</b></b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>I could think of a million reasons why this program means so much to me but I will share just a few here:</p>
<p>1) Art is a real career option for some of these students if they are given the instruction and resources to develop their talent. This has already been proven to me as I watched 4 of my more advanced students successfully sell their work last year.</p>
<p>2) It builds confidence and gives students a voice. As we all know, not every student is academically gifted but most who are not have other talents. Art happens to be one of those talents. I have seen students enter my art room and become completely different people. I have watched a child’s self esteem flourish because they have finally found something they are good at. And even those who are not particularly gifted still find joy and a sense of accomplishment when they create something of their own. </p>
<p>3) It’s something that they can control. I recall one of my students telling me that he liked painting because no matter what’s going on around him, no matter how bad things might be sometimes, when he paints, he can make something beautiful, he can make it come out however he likes. This statement broke my heart and it showed me how valuable this program has become for some of these kids. As you might imagine, not all of my students have easy lives outside of school. There are a lot of things in their lives that they simply have no power over but their art is something that they can control. It’s something that gives them the power to hope, to dream and to imagine things as they might be rather than just as they are.</p>
<p><b></b></p>
<h3><b><b>Why Do We Need a Studio?</b></b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>Though we have been making do with whatever little room is available to us thus far, I am of the opinion that these children deserve a real studio for several reasons:</p>
<p>1) We need a bigger space. The room that we have been using is only large enough for about 15 students at a time and last year I had about 60 art students in total. Though I never had all of them at once, my room was still over capacity on a daily basis. I would like to have a larger space so that more students are able to work at the same time.</p>
<p>2) We need a sink. So far I have been sending students to the communal tap to collect water for washing brushes and such. However, I would like to teach them screen printing in the future and I simply cannot send them to the communal tap to wash out printing screens. Every art room should have a sink and this will be included in our studio.</p>
<p>3) We need storage space. With so many talented students, the masterpieces start to pile up on top of each other. I had to start plastering the walls with work just for a place to put it all. Also, because many of the students are boarders, their work cannot be sent home with them until the end of the school term which results in a pretty big pile-up. </p>
<p>4) A studio will provide a space of their own where students may work year-round. Unfortunately, I cannot afford to stay the whole year as my position is strictly volunteer. This however, means that when I go back to Canada, the space we were using does not always remain available to my students. If they had a studio though, it would be their space and it would be available to them during the rest of the school year as well.</p>
<h3>How You Can Help</h3> <p>Donations of any amount are all helpful and greatly appreciated. It will take a lot of help from a lot of people to make this dream a reality but I believe that with your help, we can get there! </p>

It is an isolated, beautiful, vulnerable ecosystem with a habitat that has an important role to play in maintaining the balance
in ecosystems closer to home. 
It's therefore critical that we understand how our consumption of
resources impacts on environments such as this, and how we relate to our
environment through our dependence on it. Indigenous crafts that
are used to record resources and navigate provide an opportunity to
visualise and comprehend how the interaction between land, resources and human
ingenuity changes over time. 

This campaign exists to raise funds for a unique, once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity to enable me to take part in an artist-in-residency program aboard
a research vessel in the Arctic Circle (The Arctic Circle Residency). 
I have been invited, along with a small group of
international artists and scientists, to participate in the residency in the
remote northern archipelago of Svalbard, both on land and on the arctic seas.
The project I will be carrying out in the Arctic is called Making in Transit and is an exploration of how indigenous crafts are used to understand our environment.The Impact
Making in Transit aims to recreate indigenous crafts used for numerical recording and navigation within the Arctic Circle. These crafts will be used to record geological structures and monitor expedition resource consumption, specifically by means of; the ancient Incan Quipu and Inuit hand-carved tactile maps (such as the Ammasalik maps of Greenland). 

These crafts have been chosen because or their ability to navigate
space, record data, communicate, and help humans plan and organise their
lives. These incredible examples of human ingenuity demonstrate how craft
relates to resources and thus explores the relationship between
our environment and 'making'. 
In a world dominated by screen-based technology, the ability
of the Quipu and Inuit maps to serve as tactile data representation makes their
appeal to use as educational tools in interactive workshops both engaging and
powerful. I intend to explore the role of handmade technology and
(re)discover the relationships that can be formed with our environment through
making.
As well as enabling me to take part in this residency, raising funds
through this campaign will enable me to share my experience though an
exhibition and school workshops that explore subjects such as geography, design
and statistics.
A large part of the Making in Transit timeline 
occurs after I return from the Arctic Circle
Residency, in the form of a series of workshops run in London schools (at the
The Ellen Wilkinson School for Girls, Harris Academies and Notting Hill School).  
Conversations are also underway regarding workshops
with schools in Cardiff, Glasgow, Denmark, Sweden and Norway on my return
journey to London from Svalbard in order to engage more school students in the
project. Making in Transit will also culminate in a public exhibition
in Central London, which will be open to the public free of charge. 
All Making in Transit learning resources created
for the workshops will be made available for school teachers to use and adapt
free of charge on  TES.com (a learning resource archive used
by teachers). The Making in Transit resources will be of use for teachers of geography,
physics, mathematics, art and design, technology and engineering, and will be
adapted to be suitable for Key Stages 1–5. Please note: I am taking my own
time out of employment to carry out this work and will not receive any personal
financial gain. I am totally reliant on donors and other potential sources of
funding to complete this work. 


Who am I?My name is Jennifer Crouch, I am a school teacher, artist, lecturer and co-founder of the Art-Physics project Jiggling Atoms. I also work as current artist in residence at the UCL Centre for Advanced Biomedical Imaging (CABI) carrying out a long-term project about the relationship between craftsmanship and scientific research.  In addition to having exhibited artwork prolifically and internationally, I have also lectured at Central Saint Martins (where I am tutor on the course in Anatomical Drawing), Imperial College, Camberwell College of Arts, Bournemouth and Northampton University. I have a proven track record of running workshops, teaching school students and graduates, and organising successful exhibitions and public engagement events with organisations such as Jiggling Atoms. 
I also teach design
and technology in a secondary school and make artwork that explores science and
technology through craft, ceramics, workshops and pictorial representation. I
studied physics followed by Illustration at university and later trained as a medical
illustrator. Currently I am training to become a teacher with the School Direct 
training scheme and
completing my PGCE at Goldsmiths University – as learning underpins my artistic
work, it felt right to learn how to teach! 
What I Need & What You Get
I will only be able to take part
in the Arctic Circle Residency if I can raise enough money to make it there and
cover participation costs. I need to raise a total of £6,000. 
Travelling through the Arctic Circle, putting on an exhibition and
delivering educational workshops to schools are complicated affairs and
reaching my target will enable me to do all these things, covering:

Expedition participation on board the ship from our point of
     departure to the return point in Longyearbyen (30th September and
     19th October 2016).
Excursions on land in order to carry out essential practical work for
     the project.
Return train travel between London, Cardiff, Glasgow, Denmark,
     Sweden and Norway, and a return flight to Svalbard to enable visiting
     of destinations along the way for public engagement workshops in
     schools. 
All materials for workshops for use in the UK and abroad (simple
     portable carving tools, wood for carving and clay).
Exhibition costs and to cover talks at the exhibition given by
     expert guest speakers, who will discuss issues such as climate change,
     anthropology, the arctic ecosystem.

All donations will contribute
towards the expedition, whether I exceed or fall short
of my target. During the educational workshops students will be taught about
the Quipu and tactile carved maps and have a chance to create their own (from
soft materials such as soap bars or clay.) Their maps and Quipu will be used to
explore their own local environment and record resource use around them.
Beginning to engage with and compare our potential impact on our environment is
the first step towards understanding how to respond to change. The more
money I raise, the more people I can share this project with. 

So far, generous
supporters of Making in Transit include The Cube 
project space in East
London, who have kindly offered the use of their exhibition space to host the
Making in Transit exhibition from December 2016 to February 2017, free of
charge! This will enable visitors to see the work I will create in the Arctic,
meet experts and researchers, ask questions and express concerns about
important issues surrounding climate change. Below is an image of the entrance
of The Cube. I'm really excited about what this project could achieve, not only experiencing
the vast, cold Arctic and producing work there, but knowing that there is a platform

Perks for donorsVarious ‘perks’ are available to donors, providing supporters with opportunities to own some of my artwork, in
addition to owning hand-carved maps, Quipu and other artefacts created during
the Arctic Circle residency. All contributions of financial assistance
are gratefully received, with all donors receiving regular updates on the
project via the project website as well as invites to the final exhibition.  

As well as creating limited edition prints, ornamental printed ceramic
tiles and commemorative plates especially for this campaign, other prints from  the Magic Calendar series and printed textiles 
are also available for donors to this
campaign.

<h3><br/></h3>
<p>Hello everyone!</p>
<p>My name is Tudor Drambarean and I work for a Municipality in Romania called Alba Iulia (Transylvanian region).</p>
<p>The municipality is trying to support the local Jewish Community of Alba Iulia in order to help the conservation and preservation of the local Jewish Heritage which is very important for the long history of our city and for the history of the Jewish Community. </p>
<p><strong>Short history of the Jewish Cemetery site:</strong></p>
<p>The Jewish Cemetery from Alba Iulia is the oldest Cemetery in Transylvania, and one of the oldest in Romania. The first mentioning referring to the Cemetery date from the second part of the XVIII Century. The Cemetery was always positioned in the Old part of the city, near the historic Jewish neighborhood and at the outskirts of the Vauban Citadel Alba Carolina which was constructed in the early 18th Century when Transylvania came under Habsburg Empire rule. </p>
<p><br/>The terrain of the cemetery was bought from the Municipality in 1764, although the Jewish Cemetery also appears in a city plan dating from 1752. The oldest plan of the cemetery, which opened the first burial register, contains the names of those who were buried in the initial area. The tomb of Chief Rabbi Ezekiel Paneth (1823-1845), who built the first synagogue of wall in Transylvania, was placed in its center. The Cemetery extended its borders over time due to donations made by some members of the Jewish community such as Moses and Joseph Mendel between 1874-1875. The funerary inscriptions in Hungarian and German language, and the stylistic changes of the tombstones date from the same period. In the early 20th century, the most prosperous families in the city have raised monumental tombs in the new section. </p>
<p>The Cemetery unfortunately lost its visibility and importance during and after the Second World War when most of the Jewish inhabitants of the city left the country. It remains one of the most important Jewish Cemeteries in Romania due to the large number of tombs and the architectural heritage present.</p>
<p>There is also a theory that the cemetery might have been moved due to<br/>the construction of the large Vauban Citadel.</p>
<p><strong>Municipality's role:</strong> </p>
<p>One of the actions taken by the Municipality of Alba Iulia was to submit an application at the World Monuments Fund for the 2016 World Monuments Watch List. Unfortunately we were not successful with the application, however we are still determined to continue further and submit another application in 2017.</p>
<p>Another action taken recently was to produce a Video Documentary about the<br/>Jewish Heritage in Alba Iulia called <strong>""Testimonies Carved in Stone""</strong> in order to raise awareness internationally about the importance of this site. A link to the film you can find bellow:</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRdhkiudkb0"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRdhkiudkb0</u></a></p>
<p>This campaign is very important due to the significance of the Jewish<br/>heritage site. The Jewish Cemetery is one of the oldest in Transylvania and it<br/>contains a lot of architectural monuments which are unique in Romania and even<br/>in other parts of Europe. It is also very important since the local Jewish<br/>Community is nowadays comprised of a small group of people (18) which<br/>are the only remaining members of the local Jewish community of Alba<br/>Iulia. In this regard, to lose these impressive monuments would mean no only a<br/>loss for the Jewish Community of Alba Iulia or the city as a whole, but a loss<br/>for European and international Jewish Heritage. Moreover, the four (4)<br/>centuries old cemetery is just like an open air museum, revealing its vestiges<br/>to visitors in different historic sequences from the 17th, 18th, 19th and 20th<br/>century making it also unique in this regard.</p>
<p>Therefore the contributions raised through this campaign would<br/>contribute enormously to the preservation and promotion of an important<br/>landmark of Alba Iulia - the Jewish Cemetery - and would enable the city to strengthen again the links with an important international community which needs to be aware that Alba Iulia was once the Center of Jewish spiritual and social life in Transylvania.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<h3> </h3>
<p>The rehabilitation and preservation of the monuments within the Jewish<br/>Cemetery represent a complex project which needs the combined efforts of<br/>various experts from the municipality, local University, architecture<br/>firms and from the Jewish Community itself.</p>
<p>The financial effort is by far the most important, although the most<br/>difficult one to obtain, thus being the main reason for creating this<br/>campaign.</p>
<p><strong>Roughly the costs for the project would be the following:</strong></p>
<p><em>These restoration costs have been calculated by officially recognized local Restaurateurs which have been working already in the Jewish Cemetery and which have an in-depth knowledge on the situation of the site.</em></p>
<p><b>Restoration Project estimated time: 24 months</b></p>
<p><b>PHASES:</b></p>
<p><b>Phase I-Survey and documentation of the site </b></p>
<p>Period 1 month</p>
<p><b>PHASE II-Public Tender for employing a restoration company </b></p>
<p>Period 2 months</p>
<p><b>Phase III-Stabilization, restoration and conservation works at the 4<br/>Crypts</b></p>
<p>Period 12 months<br/><br/><strong>Chapel, Rabi’s grave home, 700 funerary stones</strong></p>

<p><b>The restoration  of the Rabi’s grave home:</b></p>
<p>- Approximately same works apply as with the chapel although at a smaller<br/>scale</p>
<p><b>TOTAL COSTS: 8.610,79 lei/2.148,35$</b></p>
<p><b>The restoration of 700 funerary stones:</b></p>
<p>- Cleaning off invading factors through chemical and mechanical factors<br/>(biologic attack or salt deposits)</p>

<p><b>TOTAL COSTS: 154.130,24 lei/38.454,69$</b></p>
<p>Period 2 months</p>
<p><b>Phase V-Restoration of the main Gate</b></p>

<p><b>TOTAL GENERAL COSTS: 687.450,97 lei / 171.515,42$ (February 2016<br/>RON/Dollar conversion)</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The site is unique in terms of monuments diversity and relevance. Members of<br/>the Jewish Community say that its uniqueness goes far beyond our national<br/>borders while its position in the city center shows that the Jewish<br/>Community has always been at the heart of events in Alba Iulia city. </p>
<p>The funding would be needed for the restoration works needed to preserve the<br/>site. Furthermore, a lot of voluntary work will also be involved, such as<br/>the organization of summer camps with students which will be working at the<br/>site. </p>
<p>It is important to mention that any donations received will be used by the Local Jewish Community itself as they know best what the needs are for the Jewish Cemetery. The Municipality is trying to support the campaign as much as possible since the community is not considerably numerous at present.</p>
<p>The amount stated above represents the total funding needed for rehabilitating the whole cemetery and about 700 of the 2000 existing stones (the oldest part of the cemetery) which is of course very substantial and not very easy to raise due to the site's low visibility. However any amount that will be obtained will be very useful for restoring at least part of the cemetery monuments such as: the 4 Monumental Crypts, the alleys, some of the Matzevas in a very bad state etc..</p>
<p>Alba Iulia Municipality would manage the proposed project due to its considerable experience in Projects’ management and implementation. The Municipality implemented in the last years numerous projects with European, national and international funding in order to restore the Vauban citadel Alba Carolina and to valorize the historic heritage within the citadel.</p>

<p> </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<h3><br/></h3>
<p>The impact of the restoration and conservation project of the Jewish<br/>Cemetery with all its heritage would be very important. Firstly all the<br/>heritage comprised of the 4 crypts, 1 chapel, the Rabbi's grave house and the<br/>over 700 tomb stones would be restored and preserved to a very good state of<br/>conservation. </p>
<p>Secondly, the Jewish Cemetery would become an outdoor Museum of Jewish<br/>history for the 60.000 inhabitants of Alba Iulia municipality, but also for the<br/>over 400.000 visitors coming to the city each year which would also ensure the<br/>sustainability of the site! </p>
<p>The visibility of the site would be greatly increased thus attracting an<br/>important number of cultural tourists, while the site would be integrated into<br/>the cultural touristic trails at national an international level. Nevertheless,<br/>the site would enable the local Jewish community to reconnect with the rest of<br/>the inhabitants of the city and would help this community to reintegrate into<br/>the city life by raising awareness of its significant history and cultural<br/>print on the evolution of the city. The project would also enable the international Jewish Community, very interested in practicing cultural and ecumenical tourism, to reconnect with one of the most important Jewish historic landmarks of Romania.</p>
<p>Last but not the least, the restoration project would also raise awareness<br/>at national and international level through the valorization of an outstanding<br/>architectural monument very important for the Romanian Jewish Community and<br/>would  particularize the Jewish community in Alba Iulia among the<br/>important historic Jewish communities in Europe and in the world. </p>
<p><strong>Alba Iulia Municipality is the institution which would manage a restoration project and will commit for the project 30.000$/120.243 LEI (February 2016, RON/Dollar conversion) as matching Funds, should the project receive at least 141.515,42$ from the Campaign or other potential donors.</strong></p>
<p>Moreover Alba Iulia Municipality is also committed to support and maintain<br/>financially, logistically and administratively the sustainability of the Jewish<br/>Cemetery after the project implementation, in partnership with the local Jewish<br/>Association.</p>
<p>Alba Iulia has a substantial experience in implementing restoration projects<br/>since during the last 7 years it has implemented numerous projects which<br/>envisaged the restoration of the Citadel inside the city (the largest Vauban<br/>Citadel in South-Eastern Europe). </p>
<p>For a <strong>list of projects</strong> implemented by the Municipality of Alba Iulia please see bellow:</p>
<p>- The Roman Castrum gate was rebuilt and it was inaugurated in 2010. Located<br/>on the Route of the Three Fortifications, it is recognized as a unique target<br/>in Europe. The value of the rehabilitation was <b>417.718,83 Euros.</b></p>
<p>- The Fifth Gate restoration costs amounted <b>589.998,35 Euros</b>.<br/>The project was funded through a grant from the Kingdom of Norway, Iceland and<br/>Liechtenstein.</p>
<p>- The Fourth Gate of the city wall located near the two cathedrals,<br/>Orthodox and Roman Catholic, hosts a tourist information center and an exhibition of the Citadel's monuments. It was completely restored as a result of a project<br/>financed by the Ministry of Culture, Alba Iulia City Council and the United<br/>Nations Development Program (UNDP), with a total value of <b>471.998,68 Euros</b>.<br/></p>
<p>- The most impressive of Vauban gates, The Third Gate (where you can<br/>also find Horea's cell) was introduced to the tourist circuit in the spring of 2009 after more than a decade since the work for rehabilitation began. The total cost of<br/>the rehabilitation works was up to <b>1.651.995,37 Euros.</b></p>
<p>- The Second Gate of the Citadel of Alba Iulia was inaugurated in 2009.<br/>It was demolished in 1937 to allow the access of the heavy machinery to the place<br/>where the Horea, Closca and Crisan Obelisk was built. The objective was restored using ancient photos and using parts of the old gate. The rehabilitation works amounted<b> 519.198,55 Euros. </b></p>
<p>- The First Gate is located in the eastern part of the assembly and is<br/>built as a triumphal arch provided with three openings. The restoration works amounted approximately <b>530.998,51 Euros.</b></p>
<p>- The project <b>""Access routes, lightning and urban furniture<br/>within the trenches of the Vauban fortress - South Route,  North Route, East<br/>Route” </b>had a total value  of <b>11.209.968,61 Euros</b>, of which more<br/>than <b>7.717.178,39 Euros </b>were allocated by the European Union and the<br/>Romanian Government. </p>
<p>- The project “<b>The</b> <b>Rehabilitation of the historic center of Alba Iulia, Vauban <br/>fortification - access roads, Exterior lighting and urban furniture. Interior<br/>zone” </b>having a total budget of<b>17.281.203,76 Euros</b>. </p>
<p>- “<b>The</b> <b>Restoration and enhancement of Alba Carolina Citadel<br/>access for the west side, Vauban Fortress,  Alba Iulia Municipality” </b>project<br/>had a total budget of <b>16.179.051,12 Euros</b> of which the City Hall’s<br/>contribution to the total value of the project was <b>3.001.993,28 Euros.</b></p>
<p>The Total amount invested through European and international<br/>funding for the rehabilitation of the Vauban Citadel between 2009-2012 was<br/>up to<strong> 48.852.131,78 EUROS. </strong></p>
<p>Thus the experience acquired by the Municipality in the last years is<br/>substantial and will make a significant difference in implementing a<br/>restoration project within the Jewish Cemetery. </p>
<p>The Municipality is very committed to restoring and promoting the cultural<br/>and architectural vestiges within the city premises in order to enrich the<br/>touristic and cultural potential of the city. The Jewish culture is part of the<br/>city's culture and history as it represents an integral part of the city's life<br/>for over four (4) centuries.</p>
<p>In 2015 Alba Iulia Municipality submitted an application for 2020 European<br/>Capital of Culture which even though was not successful still proves the city's<br/>great ambitions for becoming a beacon of culture in the region. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<h3><br/></h3>
<p>The first challenge is represented by the low visibility of the site making it virtually unknown both nationally and internationally. However this is the place where the first Jews officially settled in Transylvania. Historically and culturally this is very important since the first Rabbis were also settled here and from this place they managed the whole Jewish social and ecumenical/spiritual life, while being also the center place from where Jewish life started to flourish in Transylvania! </p>
<p>The Jewish Cemetery in Alba Iulia represents not only the identity of the<br/>Jewish community but also one of the identities of the city. It represents part<br/>of the urban heritage which needs to be protected and conserved for the future.<br/>The current main challenges to the Jewish Cemetery site are the low number of<br/>Jewish members living in the city and even at County level (only about 40)<br/>which leads to the difficult maintenance of the Cemetery, combined with the<br/>lack of technical resources and lack of adequate funds necessary for the<br/>preservation and conservation works. It is important to mention that at Alba<br/>County level there are about 19 Jewish cemeteries and only about twice the<br/>number of people from the Jewish community living here, making it impossible<br/>financially and logistically for the Jewish community to address all the existing problems!<br/><br/>The Jewish Cemetery from Alba Iulia is by far the largest and most impressive<br/>in the region and undoubtedly one of the most important in Romania.</p>
<p>For this reason, Alba Iulia Municipality would be very committed to support a restoration project of the Jewish Cemetery in Alba Iulia with its own technical experts and resources and to provide all the substantial expertise acquired during the last 7 years in the implementation of various important restoration projects, mainly with the Vauban Citadel Alba Carolina (<a href=""http://turism.apulum.ro/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>http://turism.apulum.ro/</u></a>).</p>
<p><br/>Another challenge is represented by the degradation of the cemetery due to<br/>natural factors (weather, humidity, drought, soil etc.) which has lead to the<br/>degradation of the Jewish architectural heritage <strong><em>(please check the photos annexed to the campaign for more details in this regard)</em>.</strong> The degradation state of the monuments is from medium to severe which calls for complex restoration and conservation works which will have a substantial cost. Nevertheless, the<br/>Municipality together with the local University and other local architects, stone restaurateurs, engineers, etc. are well committed and prepared to initiate a complex restoration project.</p>
<p> Moreover, as mentioned previously, there is a low public awareness<br/>about the importance of the local Jewish Cemetery of Alba Iulia among the<br/>local and regional inhabitants although the local authorities are very determined in raising public awareness and in supporting the preservation and conservation of the Jewish Cemetery in order to increase its visibility and to transform the cemetery into a visitable place due to its architectural characteristics and strategic position in the center of the city. </p>
<p>Another challenge would be the fact that the site of the Jewish Cemetery<br/>with all its monuments are not yet declared as an official historic monument<br/>which unfortunately reduces significantly the funds received from the national<br/>culture institutions in Romania and probably from else ware. This is further<br/>complicated by the fact that the Cemetery is still used today, making it complicated to change the current status of the site. Nevertheless the site of the Jewish  cemetery is historically attested  making it one of the oldest of its type and among the most important in Transylvania.</p>
<p>The lack of funding opportunities needed to conserve the Jewish Cemetery has<br/>lead to the degradation of the 4 crypts and the chapel in the Cemetery by excess of humidity coming from the earth; the severe degradation of over 700 old funerary stones affected by excess of humidity, stone deposit, growth of wild vegetation, while most of them being in an urgent need for restoration and conservation otherwise they will be unrepairable and eventually lost forever. Some of the funerary stones are unique in complexity of details and in what regards architectural significance and need urgent preservation works otherwise<br/>they will be unrepairable and eventually lost forever. </p>
<p>Through this crowd funding campaign we hope that these challenges will be at least partially overcome and that the amount raised would be sufficient at least to ensure a stable condition for the monuments within the Jewish Cemetery. It is very important to achieve this outcome in order to ensure the continuation of our local Jewish Cultural heritage also for the generations to come, which need to know and to learn that in Alba Iulia there was the first officially recognized Jewish community in Transylvania, uninterrupted till today. </p>

Hello everyone!
My name is Tudor Drambarean and I work for a Municipality in Romania called Alba Iulia (Transylvanian region).
The municipality is trying to support the local Jewish Community of Alba Iulia in order to help the conservation and preservation of the local Jewish Heritage which is very important for the long history of our city and for the history of the Jewish Community.

The Cemetery extended its borders over time due to donations made by some members of the Jewish community such as Moses and Joseph Mendel between 1874-1875. The funerary inscriptions in Hungarian and German language, and the stylistic changes of the tombstones date from the same period. In the early 20th century, the most prosperous families in the city have raised monumental tombs in the new section. 
The Cemetery unfortunately lost its visibility and importance during and after the Second World War when most of the Jewish inhabitants of the city left the country. It remains one of the most important Jewish Cemeteries in Romania due to the large number of tombs and the architectural heritage present.
There is also a theory that the cemetery might have been moved due tothe construction of the large Vauban Citadel.
Municipality's role: 
One of the actions taken by the Municipality of Alba Iulia was to submit an application at the World Monuments Fund for the 2016 World Monuments Watch List. Unfortunately we were not successful with the application, however we are still determined to continue further and submit another application in 2017.
Another action taken recently was to produce a Video Documentary about theJewish Heritage in Alba Iulia called ""Testimonies Carved in Stone"" in order to raise awareness internationally about the importance of this site. A link to the film you can find bellow:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRdhkiudkb0
This campaign is very important due to the significance of the Jewishheritage site. The Jewish Cemetery is one of the oldest in Transylvania and itcontains a lot of architectural monuments which are unique in Romania and evenin other parts of Europe. It is also very important since the local JewishCommunity is nowadays comprised of a small group of people (18) whichare the only remaining members of the local Jewish community of AlbaIulia. In this regard, to lose these impressive monuments would mean no only aloss for the Jewish Community of Alba Iulia or the city as a whole, but a lossfor European and international Jewish Heritage. Moreover, the four (4)centuries old cemetery is just like an open air museum, revealing its vestigesto visitors in different historic sequences from the 17th, 18th, 19th and 20thcentury making it also unique in this regard.
Therefore the contributions raised through this campaign wouldcontribute enormously to the preservation and promotion of an importantlandmark of Alba Iulia - the Jewish Cemetery - and would enable the city to strengthen again the links with an important international community which needs to be aware that Alba Iulia was once the Center of Jewish spiritual and social life in Transylvania.
 
What We Need & What You Get
 
The rehabilitation and preservation of the monuments within the JewishCemetery represent a complex project which needs the combined efforts ofvarious experts from the municipality, local University, architecturefirms and from the Jewish Community itself.
The financial effort is by far the most important, although the mostdifficult one to obtain, thus being the main reason for creating thiscampaign.
Roughly the costs for the project would be the following:
These restoration costs have been calculated by officially recognized local Restaurateurs which have been working already in the Jewish Cemetery and which have an in-depth knowledge on the situation of the site.
Restoration Project estimated time: 24 months
PHASES:
Phase I-Survey and documentation of the site 
Period 1 month
PHASE II-Public Tender for employing a restoration company 
Period 2 months
Phase III-Stabilization, restoration and conservation works at the 4Crypts
Period 12 monthsChapel, Rabi’s grave home, 700 funerary stones
Period 12 months
The restoration of the 4 Monumental Crypts’:

Period 2 months
Phase VI-Restoration of the Cemetery’s fence
TOTAL COSTS: 193.246,78 lei/48.214,06$
Period 3 months
Phase VII-Promotion of the site
Period 2 months
TOTAL GENERAL COSTS: 687.450,97 lei / 171.515,42$ (February 2016RON/Dollar conversion)
 
The site is unique in terms of monuments diversity and relevance. Members ofthe Jewish Community say that its uniqueness goes far beyond our nationalborders while its position in the city center shows that the JewishCommunity has always been at the heart of events in Alba Iulia city. 
The funding would be needed for the restoration works needed to preserve thesite. Furthermore, a lot of voluntary work will also be involved, such asthe organization of summer camps with students which will be working at thesite. 
It is important to mention that any donations received will be used by the Local Jewish Community itself as they know best what the needs are for the Jewish Cemetery. The Municipality is trying to support the campaign as much as possible since the community is not considerably numerous at present.
The amount stated above represents the total funding needed for rehabilitating the whole cemetery and about 700 of the 2000 existing stones (the oldest part of the cemetery) which is of course very substantial and not very easy to raise due to the site's low visibility. However any amount that will be obtained will be very useful for restoring at least part of the cemetery monuments such as: the 4 Monumental Crypts, the alleys, some of the Matzevas in a very bad state etc..
Alba Iulia Municipality would manage the proposed project due to its considerable experience in Projects’ management and implementation. The Municipality implemented in the last years numerous projects with European, national and international funding in order to restore the Vauban citadel Alba Carolina and to valorize the historic heritage within the citadel.

The Impact

The impact of the restoration and conservation project of the JewishCemetery with all its heritage would be very important. Firstly all theheritage comprised of the 4 crypts, 1 chapel, the Rabbi's grave house and theover 700 tomb stones would be restored and preserved to a very good state ofconservation. 
Secondly, the Jewish Cemetery would become an outdoor Museum of Jewishhistory for the 60.000 inhabitants of Alba Iulia municipality, but also for theover 400.000 visitors coming to the city each year which would also ensure thesustainability of the site! 
The visibility of the site would be greatly increased thus attracting animportant number of cultural tourists, while the site would be integrated intothe cultural touristic trails at national an international level. Nevertheless,the site would enable the local Jewish community to reconnect with the rest ofthe inhabitants of the city and would help this community to reintegrate intothe city life by raising awareness of its significant history and culturalprint on the evolution of the city. The project would also enable the international Jewish Community, very interested in practicing cultural and ecumenical tourism, to reconnect with one of the most important Jewish historic landmarks of Romania.
Last but not the least, the restoration project would also raise awarenessat national and international level through the valorization of an outstandingarchitectural monument very important for the Romanian Jewish Community andwould  particularize the Jewish community in Alba Iulia among theimportant historic Jewish communities in Europe and in the world. 
Alba Iulia Municipality is the institution which would manage a restoration project and will commit for the project 30.000$/120.243 LEI (February 2016, RON/Dollar conversion) as matching Funds, should the project receive at least 141.515,42$ from the Campaign or other potential donors.
Moreover Alba Iulia Municipality is also committed to support and maintainfinancially, logistically and administratively the sustainability of the JewishCemetery after the project implementation, in partnership with the local JewishAssociation.
Alba Iulia has a substantial experience in implementing restoration projectssince during the last 7 years it has implemented numerous projects whichenvisaged the restoration of the Citadel inside the city (the largest VaubanCitadel in South-Eastern Europe). 
For a list of projects implemented by the Municipality of Alba Iulia please see bellow:
- The Roman Castrum gate was rebuilt and it was inaugurated in 2010. Locatedon the Route of the Three Fortifications, it is recognized as a unique targetin Europe. The value of the rehabilitation was 417.718,83 Euros.
- The Fifth Gate restoration costs amounted 589.998,35 Euros.The project was funded through a grant from the Kingdom of Norway, Iceland andLiechtenstein.
- The Fourth Gate of the city wall located near the two cathedrals,Orthodox and Roman Catholic, hosts a tourist information center and an exhibition of the Citadel's monuments. It was completely restored as a result of a projectfinanced by the Ministry of Culture, Alba Iulia City Council and the UnitedNations Development Program (UNDP), with a total value of 471.998,68 Euros.
- The most impressive of Vauban gates, The Third Gate (where you canalso find Horea's cell) was introduced to the tourist circuit in the spring of 2009 after more than a decade since the work for rehabilitation began. The total cost ofthe rehabilitation works was up to 1.651.995,37 Euros.
- The Second Gate of the Citadel of Alba Iulia was inaugurated in 2009.It was demolished in 1937 to allow the access of the heavy machinery to the placewhere the Horea, Closca and Crisan Obelisk was built. The objective was restored using ancient photos and using parts of the old gate. The rehabilitation works amounted 519.198,55 Euros. 
- The First Gate is located in the eastern part of the assembly and isbuilt as a triumphal arch provided with three openings. The restoration works amounted approximately 530.998,51 Euros.
- The project ""Access routes, lightning and urban furniturewithin the trenches of the Vauban fortress - South Route,  North Route, EastRoute” had a total value  of 11.209.968,61 Euros, of which morethan 7.717.178,39 Euros were allocated by the European Union and theRomanian Government. 
- The project “The Rehabilitation of the historic center of Alba Iulia, Vauban fortification - access roads, Exterior lighting and urban furniture. Interiorzone” having a total budget of17.281.203,76 Euros. 
- “The Restoration and enhancement of Alba Carolina Citadelaccess for the west side, Vauban Fortress,  Alba Iulia Municipality” projecthad a total budget of 16.179.051,12 Euros of which the City Hall’scontribution to the total value of the project was 3.001.993,28 Euros.
The Total amount invested through European and internationalfunding for the rehabilitation of the Vauban Citadel between 2009-2012 wasup to 48.852.131,78 EUROS. 
Thus the experience acquired by the Municipality in the last years issubstantial and will make a significant difference in implementing arestoration project within the Jewish Cemetery. 
The Municipality is very committed to restoring and promoting the culturaland architectural vestiges within the city premises in order to enrich thetouristic and cultural potential of the city. The Jewish culture is part of thecity's culture and history as it represents an integral part of the city's lifefor over four (4) centuries.
In 2015 Alba Iulia Municipality submitted an application for 2020 EuropeanCapital of Culture which even though was not successful still proves the city'sgreat ambitions for becoming a beacon of culture in the region. 
 
Risks & Challenges

The first challenge is represented by the low visibility of the site making it virtually unknown both nationally and internationally. However this is the place where the first Jews officially settled in Transylvania. Historically and culturally this is very important since the first Rabbis were also settled here and from this place they managed the whole Jewish social and ecumenical/spiritual life, while being also the center place from where Jewish life started to flourish in Transylvania! 
The Jewish Cemetery in Alba Iulia represents not only the identity of theJewish community but also one of the identities of the city. It represents partof the urban heritage which needs to be protected and conserved for the future.The current main challenges to the Jewish Cemetery site are the low number ofJewish members living in the city and even at County level (only about 40)which leads to the difficult maintenance of the Cemetery, combined with thelack of technical resources and lack of adequate funds necessary for thepreservation and conservation works. It is important to mention that at AlbaCounty level there are about 19 Jewish cemeteries and only about twice thenumber of people from the Jewish community living here, making it impossiblefinancially and logistically for the Jewish community to address all the existing problems!The Jewish Cemetery from Alba Iulia is by far the largest and most impressivein the region and undoubtedly one of the most important in Romania.
For this reason, Alba Iulia Municipality would be very committed to support a restoration project of the Jewish Cemetery in Alba Iulia with its own technical experts and resources and to provide all the substantial expertise acquired during the last 7 years in the implementation of various important restoration projects, mainly with the Vauban Citadel Alba Carolina (http://turism.apulum.ro/).
Another challenge is represented by the degradation of the cemetery due tonatural factors (weather, humidity, drought, soil etc.) which has lead to thedegradation of the Jewish architectural heritage (please check the photos annexed to the campaign for more details in this regard). The degradation state of the monuments is from medium to severe which calls for complex restoration and conservation works which will have a substantial cost. Nevertheless, theMunicipality together with the local University and other local architects, stone restaurateurs, engineers, etc. are well committed and prepared to initiate a complex restoration project.
 Moreover, as mentioned previously, there is a low public awarenessabout the importance of the local Jewish Cemetery of Alba Iulia among thelocal and regional inhabitants although the local authorities are very determined in raising public awareness and in supporting the preservation and conservation of the Jewish Cemetery in order to increase its visibility and to transform the cemetery into a visitable place due to its architectural characteristics and strategic position in the center of the city. 
Another challenge would be the fact that the site of the Jewish Cemeterywith all its monuments are not yet declared as an official historic monumentwhich unfortunately reduces significantly the funds received from the nationalculture institutions in Romania and probably from else ware. This is furthercomplicated by the fact that the Cemetery is still used today, making it complicated to change the current status of the site. Nevertheless the site of the Jewish  cemetery is historically attested  making it one of the oldest of its type and among the most important in Transylvania.
The lack of funding opportunities needed to conserve the Jewish Cemetery haslead to the degradation of the 4 crypts and the chapel in the Cemetery by excess of humidity coming from the earth; the severe degradation of over 700 old funerary stones affected by excess of humidity, stone deposit, growth of wild vegetation, while most of them being in an urgent need for restoration and conservation otherwise they will be unrepairable and eventually lost forever. Some of the funerary stones are unique in complexity of details and in what regards architectural significance and need urgent preservation works otherwisethey will be unrepairable and eventually lost forever. 
Through this crowd funding campaign we hope that these challenges will be at least partially overcome and that the amount raised would be sufficient at least to ensure a stable condition for the monuments within the Jewish Cemetery. It is very important to achieve this outcome in order to ensure the continuation of our local Jewish Cultural heritage also for the generations to come, which need to know and to learn that in Alba Iulia there was the first officially recognized Jewish community in Transylvania, uninterrupted till today.

<h3><strong>Who is Andrea van der Kuil?</strong></h3>
<p>I am a 23-year old, Johannesburg (South African) born woman, with a dutch family and a love for Irish dancing and the arts.</p>
<p>My grandparents were all born in the Netherlands and all moved to South Africa after WWII. On my father's side, there are four children and on my mother's side there are three. Our family makes up a part of the dutch community in Johannesburg and we have kept our grandparents' origin as part of our lives. We speak dutch, eat dutch and live dutch. Despite this rich Dutch background, my brother, many of my cousins and I were brought up English, with dutch as a second language.</p>
<p>I have just graduated from Wits University with a BA Performing and Visual Arts degree. My subjects within this degree included Production Design, Physical Theatre, Musical Theatre and English. I did everything from building sets and making costumes as a first year crew member, to stage managing productions, to designing sets and costumes as a designer, to performing in various productions as an actor and dancer.</p>
<p>As a theatre designer, I work with directors, theatre makers and facilitators to make their visions and ideas become a reality on stage. What I don't often get the chance of doing, however, is directing and facilitating my own visions and ideas. Fortunately, I have been accepted to a design residency after submitting a project proposal. The residency will consist of me going to Berlin for two months and creating a work supported by a concept of my own design.</p>

<h3>More about the project...</h3>
<p>There are two instances that occurred during my University career that led me to this point in my life. These two points are my points of departure. </p>
<p>When I was in second year we were tasked with creating an installation that had to be a reaction to a specific space. We could choose the space we wanted to create our work in; one that we thought had a potentially meta characteristic. I chose one of the girls bathroom at Wits; the theatre bathroom to be exact.​</p>
<p>The reason I chose this bathroom was two-fold. Firstly, because of all of it's mirrors. It is quite a voyeuristic space and one can't stand in any corner of the bathroom without being seen by someone else standing in a completely opposing corner. The second reason was due to the worry/myth of 'spending too much time in the bathroom'. In my time spent at Wits University I had found that many girls, not only in that bathroom alone, had a strange obsession with getting in and out of the bathroom as quickly as possible; not spending 'too long' in the bathroom. This misconception around being in the bathroom extends to taking the time to look in the mirror. Does looking in the mirror make you vain?</p>
<p>Thus, my objective with my installation was to 1.) heighten the voyeuristic nature of the space and 2.) disrupt the familiar space in order to have those who went in really look and reevaluate the space. I wanted to bring an awareness to the space to those who walked in.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My second point of departure has to do with the research project I did in my honours year. The research project was entitled 'Inside/Outside Status Regarding Proxemics and Distance'. The project consisted of a practical production and a theoretical research paper. We could write our final paper on any concept/idea we wanted to, obviously relating/reflecting to the project we had completed. My paper dealt with the effects that physical, mental and emotional space had on a viewer in relation to a work of art.</p>
<p>I was very successful in the initial submissions of both these projects and believe that taken further I will be even more successful in making an impact on questions asked by many theatre practitioners.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>How much money and why?</h3>
<p>This brings me to the amalgamation of these two projects into my design residency project in Berlin. My residency will begin on the first of November and thus I have roughly three months to gather a lot of money to pay for a lot of various aspects of my trip. </p>
<p>Let me break it down:</p>
<p>Accommodation and studio space: R40000 ($2772,19​)</p>
<p>A flight to Berlin: R14000 ($970,26)</p>
<p>Food for two months: R20000 ($1386,09​​)</p>
<p>Materials to make my installation: R13000 ($693,05​)</p>
<p>Thus I need R87000 ($6060,18)</p>
<p>That's a lot of money, and the majority of the money is due to the exchange rate.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As you can see, I have a far way to go. I implore you to support me. I have never had an opportunity to show what I can do on such a large platform before and I think that this would be an amazing launching pad for someone who has just graduated. I have no doubt that the impact it will have on my life will be inexplicable!</p>

</div><h4>
<b><br/></b>
</h4><p> We handcraft Semi Sculptured Table Lamps.<br/> This lamp is 99% handmade, all the materials are hand-cut, shaped, polished,  soldered and finished. <span style=""background-color: initial;"">No two lamps are the same, each has its own  personality and character. </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Every step is meticulously done, each lamp is a  work of art intended to illuminate </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">your room and brighten  up your evenings.<br/></span> I have been an artist most of my life, I love to draw and paint. <span style=""background-color: initial;"">About 3 years ago  I tried to combine art and electronics. I was really amazed by Light Emitting  Diodes </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">or LEDs and its many applications. I have been experimenting how to  best use it and make the design unique </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">at the same time. Luckily I came up  with a beautiful organic design using the combination of LEDs, light </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">medium  like acrylic and most importantly copper. The natural beauty of copper blends  well with the </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">table lamp concept as it also serves as a metal sculpture on the  table. Shiny or patina copper is always</span><span style=""background-color: initial;""> best for metal sculpture.  <br/></span> Table lamps doesn't only illuminates our rooms but also gives us the feeling of  comfort and a <span style=""background-color: initial;"">relaxed atmosphere. So I made my table lamps desirable  and  unique giving it a little </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">organic vintage effect with the use of copper.</span></p><p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></p><p><span style=""background-color: initial;""></span></p><h4>
<b>WHAT WE NEED</b>
</h4><h4>
<b><br/></b>
</h4><p> Full funding for this project is around $5,000. The money that will be raised from <span style=""background-color: initial;""> this campaign will go to the materials and better tools for making lamps.  A portion </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">of the fund will go to developing a small home workshop to  assist  other </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">family members earn a living.<br/></span> Working 9 to 5 doesn't give me the resources to build lamps that's why I'm asking for your support<span style=""background-color: initial;""> to raise funds that will enable me to share this  wonderful piece of art to all who desire. Since</span><span style=""background-color: initial;""> I'm just starting it takes about a  day to finish two units. Hopefully I will do much better using the right tools</span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">.</span></p>

</h4><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;""> Me and my wife will start everything based on our career backgrounds, we are    both teachers before. <span style=""background-color: initial;"">I will cover the electronics and art side while my wife and  possibly  my son will assist in the basic production </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">process, packing and  shipping.

WHAT WE DO


 We handcraft Semi Sculptured Table Lamps. This lamp is 99% handmade, all the materials are hand-cut, shaped, polished,  soldered and finished. No two lamps are the same, each has its own  personality and character. Every step is meticulously done, each lamp is a  work of art intended to illuminate your room and brighten  up your evenings. I have been an artist most of my life, I love to draw and paint. About 3 years ago  I tried to combine art and electronics. I was really amazed by Light Emitting  Diodes or LEDs and its many applications. I have been experimenting how to  best use it and make the design unique at the same time. Luckily I came up  with a beautiful organic design using the combination of LEDs, light medium  like acrylic and most importantly copper. The natural beauty of copper blends  well with the table lamp concept as it also serves as a metal sculpture on the  table. Shiny or patina copper is always best for metal sculpture.   Table lamps doesn't only illuminates our rooms but also gives us the feeling of  comfort and a relaxed atmosphere. So I made my table lamps desirable  and  unique giving it a little organic vintage effect with the use of copper.
WHAT WE NEED


 Full funding for this project is around $5,000. The money that will be raised from  this campaign will go to the materials and better tools for making lamps.  A portion of the fund will go to developing a small home workshop to  assist  other family members earn a living. Working 9 to 5 doesn't give me the resources to build lamps that's why I'm asking for your support to raise funds that will enable me to share this  wonderful piece of art to all who desire. Since I'm just starting it takes about a  day to finish two units. Hopefully I will do much better using the right tools.
 OUR TEAM 

 Me and my wife will start everything based on our career backgrounds, we are    both teachers before. I will cover the electronics and art side while my wife and  possibly  my son will assist in the basic production process, packing and  shipping. I'm  presently working on completing all the prototypes for the perks.
  WHAT'S BEHIND IT   FORT LUMINA   THIS UNIQUE TABLE LAMP IS DELICATELY AND INTRICATELY MADE USING    RAW MATERIALS SUCH AS COPPER WIRES, COPPER CLAD, LEDS, AND              PLASTIC LIGHT MEDIA. COPPER IS THE DESIGN BASE AND ACRYLIC AND        LIGHT IS THE CENTER PIECE. THE INSPIRATION BEHIND THE DESIGN IS A        FORTRESS MADE OF CRYSTAL ILLUMINATED FROM WITHIN.THE                          REFLECTIONS ARE CONCENTRATED WITHIN THE FORT INDICATING A                STRONG FEELING OR POWER COMING FROM THE LIGHT.    SCULPTED  COPPER FORMS THE BASE AND ALSO SURROUNDS THE                 ENTIRE LIGHT DISPLAY. ALMOST IN ITS RAW FORM IT REPRESENTS                   EARTH FROM WHICH THE METAL CAME FROM.                                                                 FORT LUMINA                                                                    SPUTNIK    INSPIRED BY THE THE RUSSIAN ARTIFICIAL EARTH SATELLITE, THIS                  ILLUMINATED SPHERE WILL ADD CLASS AND UNIQUENESS TO ANY ROOM.    COPPER IS THE DESIGN BASE AND ACRYLIC AND LIGHT IS THE CENTER          PIECE.

<h3>Ninjaprints</h3>
<p>Ninjaprints was set up over a decade ago as my brand for my creative outlet and was always designed to be a flexible and far reaching venture, over the last 10 years I have established myself as a well regarded photographer as well as a dedicated creative and supporter of emerging artists, some years back we also expanded into printing services and are looking to further increase our reach and seize a key opportunity.</p>
<p>Many of you who are likely to be viewing this will already be aware of my photographic and print work due to the nature of social media and friend circles, you will also know that I have never run any such fund raiser before and that I have never really been a huge supporter of the over use of such fund sourcing methods that seems prevalent in today's society.</p>
<p>I have tried to come up with a solution that allows this fund raiser to garner genuine interest and raise the funds it needs whilst at the same time making sure it offers valid reasons for people to contribute and actually provide benefits that go some way to matching their contributions whilst not hindering any launch.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Following is a rough breakdown of what I need to raise and cover along with how it will be used and what will happen if target is exceeded or not reached.</p>
<ul>
<li>New large format Epson printer with roll feed £1800</li>
<li>A3/A4 high res flatbed scanner with potential for negative scanning £500</li>
<li>Paper cutter / trimmer £120</li>
<li>New desk £150</li>
</ul>
<p>Initial funds will be solely focused on getting a secondary large format printer in place to ensure downtime is kept to a minimum and to increase the rate we can output jobs whilst keeping overall costs down by not having to force ink changes between media types at a heavy price.</p>
<p>Having a secondary printer is vital to the current work as any problems, faults with the main one will prove catastrophic at this stage.</p>
<p>Further funds will be allocated to repairing / replacing my current warped and old desk space so I have a large, flat surface to work with for the jobs that require it and obtaining a high end paper cutter will be much needed for handling large prints and complex pieces that need trimming to size, at present this is all done by hand which is adequate but not as accurate as I need.<br/><br/>Final main targets would be to obtain a high resolution flatbed scanner for processing images and negatives in order to be able to offer print services for conventional photographers and illustrators.</p>
<p>Any excess funds will be used to procure storage space and shelving for paper and inks and if enough is raised a  A3+ fine art printer to act as a dedicated label printer, these will further be upgraded with refillable ink systems.  Should the target be very much exceeded I will look to obtain office space locally and a workstation for use there.</p>
<p>If targets are not reached funds will be put aside to use towards the main targets in any place, business is steadily coming in at an increasing rate and likely some of the goalposts will be reachable within a few months.</p>
<p>Rewards for contributions will be offered to all who pay into the campaign, vouchers (digital or physical) will be provided to cover printing work to the value of your contribution which can be redeemed for physical prints once we are set up with the new equipment, or with the current equipment if targets are not reached.  This method allows us to basically be selling a service in advance that will allow you to reclaim your value from the print lab in physical goods once we are set up and running.<br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>All funds raised will have a huge impact on the overall business, right now work is coming in thick and fast and I am struggling to keep on top of it, but the volumes being output will start to take their toll on the printing equipment and with nothing to fall back on if something breaks or fails it is not an ideal situation, having backup and secondary equipment is vital to being able to offer a reliable service and also balance the workflow.</p>
<p>Formally launching the fine art and photographic printing service alongside the labels is also a brilliant opportunity to expand reach and target audience, the equipment is already in use and expanding the market is a reliable way to increase profits, but to do so we need to ensure equipment is up to the job and supported by the tools required to provide an excellent service along with the space to make it work.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Right now the main risks are very much in the form of equipment failure, should something suffer a fault now there is no backup in place and no means to continue developing and expanding the business and its reach.</p>
<p>Timing is also critical, other businesses dealing with the specific label industry I am targeting have recently been shedding business due to poor customer service and quality, the window is now and I need to seize it as fast as I can before it starts to close.<br/><br/>I have been printing for some years now and am rapidly learning new methods and techniques to create fantastic quality work across a range out areas, every new method or media is a learning curve and sometimes incredibly tricky, but the business is there and the market is ripe for a business like Ninjaprints to make a real strong impact with the current timing.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I utterly appreciate the lack of appeal crowdfunding can have to many people, myself included, so I have tried to keep this to a minimum of scrounging and am seeking to use this in whatever form it takes to push my small business forward as hard as I can after over a decade of seeking the kind of opportunities now showing their faces.<br/><br/>Everyone has different mindsets and circumstances and do not feel bad if you cannot contribute or do not wish to, but please do share this fundraiser for me, every little helps and goes a long way towards boosting Ninjaprints into something that can develop more rapidly and without constant worry.</p>
<p>Many thanks for taking the time to read, ponder and maybe even contribute.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi Guys, my name is Aleko and I am Youtube Magician. My Channel is called Tricklandia. I do lot's of Tutorial videos on different kinds of Magic Tricks.  I was always specially passionate about playing cards and I always wanted to have my own custom version of cards, that's why, about a year ago I've decided to create one. After countless hours of hard work and dedication I am proud to introduce <strong>Piramida Playing Cards</strong>, equipped <strong>with Built in Marking System and two Gaff cards</strong>. The Goal was to create a tool, a perfect helper, to conquer the impossible. A Superior Marking System combined with Luxury Design allows the artists to perform like never before. <strong>With Piramida Cards you can create real miracles, amaze people with stunning effects, which are impossible to do with the regular Decks of Cards</strong>. Piramida Cards will be printed by  Expert Playing Card Co (EPCC), On the highest quality stock available,  to provide the smoothest spreads, fans, and shuffles.

<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
<p>The only challenge is getting enough funding to get the decks printed. The Expert Playing Card Company ( EPCC )requires a minimum order of 1000 decks. But because I have three different Shades ( Black, Red and Desert ) it means that I am required to print minimum 3000 decks, This is large amount of money, which is why I am asking for your support in this Indiegogo campaign.</p>
<p>Once I have the funds I will be ready to print. Your rewards will be sent to you as soon as production is complete, which I expect to be in May of 2018 (hopefully sooner). </p>
<p> Every Dollar counts. I already have $12000 for this project but I need little more to fully fund  it. Thank you very much for your Support.</p>

After countless hours of hard work and dedication I am proud to introduce Piramida Playing Cards, equipped with Built in Marking System and two Gaff cards. The Goal was to create a tool, a perfect helper, to conquer the impossible. A Superior Marking System combined with Luxury Design allows the artists to perform like never before. With Piramida Cards you can create real miracles, amaze people with stunning effects, which are impossible to do with the regular Decks of Cards. Piramida Cards will be printed by  Expert Playing Card Co (EPCC), On the highest quality stock available,  to provide the smoothest spreads, fans, and shuffles. Piramida Cards are Borderless and come in two shades BLACK and RED plus Limited Edition Piramida Desert with White Borders. All Piramida Decks come with beautiful Silver - Foiled and Embossed Tuck Cases.

Every Piramida deck contains 57 Cards, including 2 Jokers and 2 Gaff Cards ( 1x Double Backer and 1 x Double Facer ) and 1 x Sponsor Card.

 The Cost of Piramida Black is $10

The Cost of Piramida Red Deck is $10

Borederless Design Creates strong Blending Effect, which helps the performer to do Sleights easier.

The Tuck Boxes will be Silver Foiled and Embossed.

With Piramida Cards you can create stunning effects which are not possible with the regular deck of cards.

Limited Addition  Piramida Desert
Piramida Desert comes in true color of Desert with White Borders, it is also equipped with Built in Marking System and Gaff Cards ( Double Backer and Double Facer ).  Limited Edition Piramida Desert Decks are all Indiegogo Exclusive. They will not be sold after this Campaign ends. The Cost of each Piramida Desert Deck is $15 and it's Limited to 6 Decks per Backer. Limited Edition Decks will be NUMBERED !!! 



Custom Faces
The faces include custom fonts, pips, court cards, Ace of Spades and Jokers. Everything about Piramida Cards is Custom.





The idea of Joker represents all the obstacles of life, unfairness and humiliation happening around us every day.


Risks & Challenges
The only challenge is getting enough funding to get the decks printed. The Expert Playing Card Company ( EPCC )requires a minimum order of 1000 decks. But because I have three different Shades ( Black, Red and Desert ) it means that I am required to print minimum 3000 decks, This is large amount of money, which is why I am asking for your support in this Indiegogo campaign.
Once I have the funds I will be ready to print. Your rewards will be sent to you as soon as production is complete, which I expect to be in May of 2018 (hopefully sooner). 
 Every Dollar counts. I already have $12000 for this project but I need little more to fully fund  it. Thank you very much for your Support.",17.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>The Journey</strong></p>
<p>The AromAtom journey will take you on a tour of our Solar System and beyond, stopping at places such as our Moon, Mars, Jupiter, comets and asteroids, the rings of Saturn and the spiral arms of the Milky Way, to explore their surfaces, atmospheres and histories.</p>
<p>At each “station” you will be surrounded by images of the place where you are, and will be provided with a  number of things to smell, which will give an approximation of what being in that planet or part of the galaxy might be like. As you smell, you can read or hear about the odours you are smelling, and also how and why those odours might be found at different locations in space. Basic chemistry, astronomy, physics and geology concepts are weaved into the story to help you form a realistic picture of the part of space where you are and give context to your experience. Many of the smells will be strange or even alien to you, but before moving on to the next “station”, an artistic interpretation of the smell of the planet will also be provided, and this one will be much nicer!</p>
<p>The exhibition ends with a scent that combines the various stages of the AromAtom journey into one single fragrance that can be worn as a perfume or used as room fragrance. Of course, it had to be named ‘Out of this World’, and it will take you all the way from Earth to the heart of the Milky Way; I like to think of it as the T.A.R.D.I.S. of the perfume world!</p>
<p><strong>Who am I, and how did I come up with this?</strong></p>
<p>Hello, I’m Marina, a forty something year old perfumer who, until ten years ago, was terrified of science, because it made me feel inadequate in a world full of what I thought of as ‘clever people’. In my thirties I had a revelation…my own curiosity was pushing me towards discovering the world around me, and slowly, without meaning to, I fell in love with science, and I discovered that it doesn't have to be difficult and boring. The main difference between many of those clever people and me was that they were encouraged to discover the wonders of science as children and young adults by their families and teachers, whilst I had been discouraged from doing so.</p>
<p>Sadly, this is a story many of us know, and one that is still common in today’s society. Things need to change, and AromAtom is here to encourage and support that change, by presenting science in a fun way for children and adults. You are never too old to fall in love with science!</p>
<p>As a perfumer, my own curiosity has always made me wonder about why things smell the way they do, and when something doesn't have an odour, I can't but imagine and create fantasy smells in my mind for these 'odourless' things. It is my fascination with both space science and fragrance that has led me to create AromAtom, an interactive and innovative experience, that uses olfactory journeys to engage with STEM subjects that are often perceived as difficult and challenging.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">Creating blends in the perfume lab</p>
<p><strong>The Impact                                     </strong></p>
<p>AromAtom is for everyone. At its most basic level, its primary aim is to demystify science by presenting it as a fun and accessible experience that anybody can participate in, regardless of age, education or background. This will be achieved in two different ways:</p>
<p>1.    Introducing the AromAtom experience through exhibitions aimed at people of all ages. These will be held at a number of art venues and science fairs, where we hope to reach people of all ages.<br/>2.    Taking the AromAtom experience to schools, science clubs and educational events, with the specific aims of igniting the imagination of children and young adults, and encouraging them develop an interest in science.</p>
<p>I believe that it is imperative to make science more fun, exciting and accessible for all.  Combining olfactory art with science creates a platform to explore STEM subjects in a fun and innovative way, by introducing them through an array of weird and wonderful smells.</p>
<p><strong>Where will the money go?</strong></p>
<p>Participants will be exploring several bodies found in the Solar System, as well as other parts of the galaxy and the universe. For each area explored we need the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>At least four banners and posters displaying relevant images and facts;</li>
<li>Booklets and fact-sheets explaining how each place would smell and why, including fun astronomy, chemistry and geology information, to complete the experience while participants are smelling;</li>

<h3>From Tokyo to the US, then from the World back to Japan.<br/> </h3>
<p><strong>International artist, <a href=""http://www.takashihara.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Takashi Hara</a>, and modern fashion Kimono brand, <a href=""http://robe-japonica.jp/en/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">ROBE JAPONICA</a> will start a “new” funk art exhibition tour, Taboo City.  We believe we can make a change within controlled societies and inspire people to live strong.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Everybody has something bright.</strong></h3>
<p>We believe everyone has something bright and unique within themselves.  Sometimes this brightness can be seen, but sometimes it remains hidden. While some individuals can express themselves strongly, others tend to struggle. I think this division of expression is totally fine because the world wouldn't be nearly as interesting if we all expressed ourselves in the same manner. It’s nice to share and understand our different characteristics.</p>
<p>We want to support people who struggle to keep this brightness -  it is okay to live the way you are. We believe our collaborative art tour would make a change. Even though it may be a tiny change on each person, it can be a big wave with numerous people.</p>

<p>There are many rules in a society that exist besides law, most of which are <strong>unspoken rules</strong>. Do we really have to follow all of these rules? Is it necessary to become <strong>a</strong> <strong>follower</strong> because of what other people are doing? Unknown rules that exist deeply in our societies along with <strong>the indefinable constraints</strong> we share - those are <strong>the rusted chains engraved on our individual hearts</strong>.</p>
<p>The whole installation is combination of <strong>a toy-like floating city</strong> <strong>in a huge kimono and texting tunnel.</strong></p>
<p><u><strong>Kimono?</strong></u><br/>It is a traditional Japanese garment. The word ""kimono"", actually means a ""thing to wear"" (ki ""wear"" and mono ""thing""), has come to denote these full-length robes. The kimono is always worn for important festivals or formal occasions. It is a formal style of clothing associated with politeness and good manners.</p>
<p>- Wikipedia</p>
<p><strong>ROBE JAPONICA</strong> is making <strong>a huge kimono</strong> with special design with traffic signs, streets, and some other rules you may see in a city. <strong>Takashi Hara </strong>will create <strong>pig sculptures</strong> living within the city of <strong>artful architectures</strong> made from tree logs and old house posts. There will be <strong>a piggy train</strong> going through the city with the small pigs following these rules without doubt.</p>
<p><u><strong>Why Pigs?</strong></u><br/>Pigs are an iconic and reoccurring representation with <strong>Takashi Hara</strong>’s artistic practice.  He uses <strong>pigs</strong> and <strong>texts</strong> as a narrative in his allegorical artwork to reflect on societies and their tendencies to put ambitions in a cage. In most cultures, the pig is a subject of derision and abuse. We confine them and manipulate them to our own needs. <strong>What is so different from our lives in a manipulative society?</strong></p>

<p>Their concept, “Wearing modern Japan,” alludes to society’s view of the kimono, which is seen as a craft and beautiful tradition that is only worn under particular and ‘proper’ situations.  Individuality should be more important than following proper views of fashion.  ROBE JAPONICA attempts to loosen the way kimonos are worn by creating a more casual approach to this beautiful tradition.</p>
</div></div>","“UNCHAIN YOUR HEART” 
From Tokyo to the US, then from the World back to Japan. 
International artist, Takashi Hara, and modern fashion Kimono brand, ROBE JAPONICA will start a “new” funk art exhibition tour, Taboo City.  We believe we can make a change within controlled societies and inspire people to live strong.
 
Everybody has something bright.
We believe everyone has something bright and unique within themselves.  Sometimes this brightness can be seen, but sometimes it remains hidden. While some individuals can express themselves strongly, others tend to struggle. I think this division of expression is totally fine because the world wouldn't be nearly as interesting if we all expressed ourselves in the same manner. It’s nice to share and understand our different characteristics.
We want to support people who struggle to keep this brightness -  it is okay to live the way you are. We believe our collaborative art tour would make a change. Even though it may be a tiny change on each person, it can be a big wave with numerous people.
*When you help me in Japanese, please look at the Motion Gallery website.

“Taboo City” Draft Image
*Scale: H2.5MxW3MxD3M  (H8’xW10’xD10’)
 
*Huge Kimono Design
There are many rules in a society that exist besides law, most of which are unspoken rules. Do we really have to follow all of these rules? Is it necessary to become a follower because of what other people are doing? Unknown rules that exist deeply in our societies along with the indefinable constraints we share - those are the rusted chains engraved on our individual hearts.
The whole installation is combination of a toy-like floating city in a huge kimono and texting tunnel.
Kimono?It is a traditional Japanese garment. The word ""kimono"", actually means a ""thing to wear"" (ki ""wear"" and mono ""thing""), has come to denote these full-length robes. The kimono is always worn for important festivals or formal occasions. It is a formal style of clothing associated with politeness and good manners.
- Wikipedia
ROBE JAPONICA is making a huge kimono with special design with traffic signs, streets, and some other rules you may see in a city. Takashi Hara will create pig sculptures living within the city of artful architectures made from tree logs and old house posts. There will be a piggy train going through the city with the small pigs following these rules without doubt.
Why Pigs?Pigs are an iconic and reoccurring representation with Takashi Hara’s artistic practice.  He uses pigs and texts as a narrative in his allegorical artwork to reflect on societies and their tendencies to put ambitions in a cage. In most cultures, the pig is a subject of derision and abuse. We confine them and manipulate them to our own needs. What is so different from our lives in a manipulative society?
 
*Draft Image of Texting Tunnel
*Tunnel Deisgn
Grey and green represent our texting culture, which is disconnected and colder than actual conversations. It guides viewers to think of how some words, which people throw out, are like intangible chains. The grey side is made of traditional fabric, and the green side is made by ROBE JAPONICA with calligraphic texts by Hara on top.
ソレハダメデシ                    なんで？ (That’s not right. Can’t do that.                 Why not?)
フツウミンナヤラナイカラ                                    XXX?  (Because, Normally, we don't do such a thing.                XXX?)
ソウイウモノダカラ　　    だめって誰が決めたの  (It’s just how it is.                Who decided it’s wrong?)
ソンナノワガママダ　　　そんなことはないちゃんと考えてる  (Don’t be selfish.                 Come on, I’m actually thinking well.)
チャントマッスグアルキナヨ　　　 （ぐちゃぐちゃに消した文字）（You should walk straight & properly.                “unreadable writing”)
 
Return
We would like to send a part of art from Taboo City, and add supporters’ name to Team Taboo City, which will be displayed within the installation during the tours. 
For investing reason, we set prices somewhere at 50%off from our market price and include shipping fee from Japan.

<p><strong>Short Summary</strong></p>
<p>Make America’s Fate {MAF} is the combined effort of Hamtramck-based artists, Valon Gatz and Nicki Szydlo.  Nicki is an artist whose colorful abstract paintings are informed by her intuition.  She has a BFA from Wayne State University with experience in printmaking and bookmaking, and regularly works in her home studio.  </p>
<p>Valon is a senior in Wayne State’s Journalism program. He has experience working with publications in the Metro Detroit area; often preferring to gather people’s stories over more clinical analyses of local issues.  </p>
<p>Make America’s Fate is Valon and Nicki’s combined response to an election season that has implanted both fear and hope within the American people in unprecedented fashion.</p>
<p>Inspired by the testimonies that they heard from concerned citizens; they started MAF in an attempt to chronicle these very real fears and hopes in a way that didn’t feel impersonal.  The serial will be a collection of 10 unique American narratives about their own experience with the 2016 presidential election and 10 paintings inspired by the emotional content of each narrative.  Each edition will be a DIY-printed copy of one citizen’s story, with a high-quality print of the painting as the cover.  Each copy will be free.  By distributing MAF in our community’s shared spaces, we distribute this project in a way that is truly accessible and personal.  </p>
<p>This is where you come in.  To help fund the cost of printing for this project for and about our communities - we need assistance from our communities.</p>
<p>The entirety of MAF will always be available online for free, but the printed aspect of the project is SO important.  Being able to hold a copy of a book in your hand makes it so much more personal than reading it on a blog.</p> <p>By donating to the project, you help us print in a way that looks good and more importantly--can be distributed on a meaningful scale.</p> <p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>Art printing is expensive.  Even in our least expensive quote, to get high-quality prints made of the paintings with archival ink on acid-free paper, they would cost upwards of $7 each - meaning each book would cost us at least that much to print.  Unfortunately, the lucrative career of an artist doesn’t normally allow us to spend $7 each on something we want to make 200 of.  We did a bit of research and discovered that printing at home was much more economical, and wouldn’t sacrifice the quality of the print.  All funds raised will go directly towards our DIY printing operation. We’ve set a modest goal with the idea in mind that every donation counts. Should we fail to reach our goal, we’ll still use what was given to us and put it toward the costs of the operation. </p> <p>The main cost we need to worry about is the combined cost of a high quality photo printer and a continuous ink system. The former allows us to print covers that capture the lush detail of the original painting. The latter, the Continuous Ink System, allows us to print several covers in a more cost-effective way than having to buy several overpriced single print cartridges.</p>
<p>Our initial goal of $600 includes the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Photo Printer - $350</li>
<li>A Continuous Ink System - $150</li>
<li>Paper - $100</li>
</ul>
<p>With this, we could print 200 issues. Since we will release ten stories, this means we could print 20 copies of each story. At this scale of distribution, it costs us about $3 an issue.</p>
<p>If we could get another $200($850 total), we could print 40 copies of each issue, a combined 400 copies total. This would make the cost per issue about $2.13.</p>
<p>If we made another $200($1050), we could make 60 copies of each issue, resulting in 600 issues at a cost of $1.83 per issue.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>The 2016 election has caused a unprecedented reaction in the American public. During election season, <a href=""http://www.people-press.org/2016/06/22/partisanship-and-political-animosity-in-2016/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">a poll on political animosity</a> found that Americans were more divided by their ideologies in this election than they had been in the prior two decades.</p>
<p>Naturally, this has created a disproportionate amount of fear in some and elation in others. Conversing with fellow Detroiters, we found some of our neighbors now feared for their lives in what was supposed to be one of the safest nations on earth.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen how Trump’s presidency will affect all of us. What’s more clear are the emotional testimonies of Americans in this historic moment. We thought these testimonies were largely important, that they shouldn’t be forgotten. It was with that in mind that we started MAF, as a way to document these voices and to gain perspective through a unique medium with an intensely personal lens.</p> <p>We believe it’s important to share these stories as widely as possible, and we hope you do too.  Contributing to MAF is a great way to give our local community a direct way to connect with the experiences of others.  If successful, it will be a way to connect several communities through the same project.  After an election that has left our nation so divided, empathy and understanding for our fellow Americans is more important than ever. It’s our hope that MAF will do a small part in helping achieve that for people across the country.</p> <p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
<p>We have been very excited to get the ball rolling on this project for quite some time.  In turn, we have had plenty of time to discuss the possible outcomes of this crowdfunding campaign.</p> <p>In the event that we do not reach our fundraising goal, we will still create and print MAF until its completion of 10 issues.  We may have to purchase our printer used, and we may only distribute in a limited, local run.<br/> </p>
<p>Regardless, whatever the outcome of the crowd-funding, we WILL see MAF to its completion, even if we have to pay out of pocket to do so.  This is a project that is worth sharing, if only on a small scale.  Your help wouldn’t make less work for us, it’ll allow us the opportunity to do more work and get these issues out to a larger number of communities.</p> <p>On the other hand, if we get overfunded, all money raised past the goal will go directly towards printing costs.  At $600, we are able to print 20 copies of each edition.  At $850, we can print 40, and at $1100 we can print 60.  Once we have the printer and continuous ink system, the cost of paper and ink are our main concerns.</p> <p>And if we get lucky enough to get funded way beyond what we have requested here, we may have to replace equipment and/or hire someone to help us print.</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>Share this project on social media. Spread the word about our crowd-funding and also our need for more interviewees.</p> <p>Donate art materials, since we aren’t asking for a dime to cover the cost of what Nicki is using to create her paintings.

HOOKING YOU UP WITH ARTWORK, FOR OFFSETTING YOUR CARBON FOOTPRINT.

I'm Niko Dellios; a digital nomad, adventurer, artist, and photographer. 
We need more ways to show the world that we give a shit, so I'm seeking to give you an opportunity through backing artwork.
Follow the journey through photography, and drone imagery.

www.crimsoncamper.com




THE PRINTS
THE WEST COAST OF THE UNITED STATES IS GRAND. THE PEOPLE, THE PARKS, THE SURF; EPIC.
 I'm capturing the highlights through vibrant paint markers. For additional backing I'm taking requests for subject matter/locations of illustrations.

The majority of your backings go to a carbon offset organization of your choice.
A small portion of your backing will cover printing/processing and shipping costs.
That means that your are taking steps to a better/cleaner/healthier future for all.
See them: www.crimsoncamper.com




 
WHY OFFSET?
WHETHER YOU'RE A DIGITAL NOMAD DRIVING THE PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY IN YOUR CAMPER, COMMUTING TO WORK IN YOUR CAR, OR USING A TOASTER...
YOU'VE GOT A CARBON FOOTPRINT.
Burning fossil fuels for transportation creates CO2, which has a massive impact on the natural cycles of our world (with and without humans). The more you burn, the bigger your footprint.
If you like it here (Earth)...it's time to take action to preserve it.

It's not realistic for all of us to move ""off the grid"" and become carbon neutral.
This is a great way to mitigate your impact, by supporting organizations that specialize in emission reduction.
View your offset as insurance (but tangible): protecting yourself from a not-so-desirable future.

<h2><strong>Short Summary</strong></h2>
<p>Hey there! My name is Daniel Gold. I am a NYC based choreographer and performer that created Leg Up On Life. Leg Up On Life is an artistic initiative that was created to help give a platform or artists to come together to present works while raising money for phenomenal organizations that give back directly to society.</p>
<p>As an artist I have learned it is not always easy to come by opportunities to present new work or even get on stage as a performer. Leg Up is a way to help give more opportunities for artists to utilize their craft while giving back to the community in the best way they know how.</p>

I am a professional actor born in the U.S.A and based in Edinburgh, Scotland, UK. I have an acting degree from the University of Central Lancashire (UCLan). My experience is mostly in live theatre but I find all forms of acting fascinating. I take an active interest in politics, particular US politics, and am drawn to forms of art that challenge people and give life to new and progressive ideas.</p><p><b>What's the idea and why does it matter?</b></p><p>As an American citizen, I am regularly drawn back into U.S. Politics and I find President Donald Trump appallingly fascinating, harrowing and intriguing all at the same time. Many people speak of his impeachment and his resignation with a sense of imminence but it has become apparent that although the former is getting more and more likely, the latter is not. Donald Trump does not appear to be of the opinion that he has done anything wrong despite countless evidence to the contrary. </p><p>But what if one day, he did? What if one day he suddenly wanted to reform and take back everything he has done? What would it take for him to make up for everything, or is it even possible to seek that kind of redemption? What kind of things would he need to say in such a speech in order to gain, if possible, forgiveness from all the people he has wronged?</p><p>I asked myself these questions and realised the answers turned into my writing the resignation speech we all deserve to hear. But to do this speech justice, and to bring it to life, I need everyone's help to do it.</p><p>I want to create an immersive film so everyone can meet The Good Donald and then see him fall. The ins and outs I'll detail, but by contributing to this project you will be rewarded with seeing what may never happen; Donald Trump resigning. I will perform and give a version of Donald Trump that is articulate, remorseful and good. This is something I don't just want to show to the world, but to the president himself.

I have an acting degree from the University of Central Lancashire (UCLan). My experience is mostly in live theatre but I find all forms of acting fascinating. I take an active interest in politics, particular US politics, and am drawn to forms of art that challenge people and give life to new and progressive ideas.What's the idea and why does it matter?As an American citizen, I am regularly drawn back into U.S. Politics and I find President Donald Trump appallingly fascinating, harrowing and intriguing all at the same time. Many people speak of his impeachment and his resignation with a sense of imminence but it has become apparent that although the former is getting more and more likely, the latter is not. Donald Trump does not appear to be of the opinion that he has done anything wrong despite countless evidence to the contrary. But what if one day, he did? What if one day he suddenly wanted to reform and take back everything he has done? What would it take for him to make up for everything, or is it even possible to seek that kind of redemption? What kind of things would he need to say in such a speech in order to gain, if possible, forgiveness from all the people he has wronged?I asked myself these questions and realised the answers turned into my writing the resignation speech we all deserve to hear. But to do this speech justice, and to bring it to life, I need everyone's help to do it.I want to create an immersive film so everyone can meet The Good Donald and then see him fall. The ins and outs I'll detail, but by contributing to this project you will be rewarded with seeing what may never happen; Donald Trump resigning. I will perform and give a version of Donald Trump that is articulate, remorseful and good. This is something I don't just want to show to the world, but to the president himself. I want his reaction to the version of himself that cares. You will help me to achieve this.The Funding StuffThe total cost for this performance we believe will be £2000.

<h3>Who Am I?</h3>
<p>I'm a PhD student in Creative Writing. Currently unemployed. I'm the first in my family to graduate high school. I taught English for 10 years, got my MFA in poetry, sold my GNND house, and bet everything I had on getting a PhD. I teach College Composition, tutor part-time, and generally try to get involved in things that matter.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>

<p>I don't get paid all summer. My tutoring job is down to 0 to 2 hours a week. Serving jobs are not hiring for the summer. I need a little moola to help pay the bills (rent for June is covered!)</p>
<p>So I'm making a zine! It will have original comics, poems, and other creative stuff. This project will be made completely by me--no editors, no publishers, no printers--just me. You won't find this stuff in any academic journals, lit mags, or poetry rags--just the old fashioned way: printed at Kinkos. </p>

<p><strong>A painting is born</strong></p>
<p> If I see a beautiful landscape it goes straight into my heart and my feelings start to play with it. Trees change colour to blue or purple, water flows, not downhill but uphill, houses twist and reshape, they become castles or flying homes created for love. When I work the painting always comes from the subconsious part of me. It works it´s way like a feeling starting from the heart and slowly moving like a warm wind to my brain. There it moves around for a while, playing with diffrent settings of color, shape and refelction. The painting can stay there in my brain for days, sometimes weeks or even months. It is a little like carrying a baby, you hold it within you and care for it with feelings and thoughts. Finally the painting is ready to be born.</p>
<p>Then I go into the flow, letting the shapes run down from my brain, down to the canvas and find their place. I use a lot of water when I work and let the colors mix and remix. There are layer after layer of paint, letting one color shine through the colors painted abowe. Light is very important in my paintings and I let it glow like a strange moon dancing across the skies or like splashes from a waterfall.</p>

<p>The painting progress takes time. Every layer of paint that I put on the painting has to get completely dry before I can start with the next layer. And so it goes on, layer after layer - sometimes up to 20 layers on one painting. </p>
<p>But then I come to the point where I feel I have let out what the painting wanted to say and the shape it wanted to form on the canvas. It is a feeling of complete and peace, but also a litte of ""missing my inspiration"" it has now been transformed into a painting thats shining in front of me.</p>
<p>The work is done and I go out again to find new inspiraton.</p>

But then I come to the point where I feel I have let out what the painting wanted to say and the shape it wanted to form on the canvas. It is a feeling of complete and peace, but also a litte of ""missing my inspiration"" it has now been transformed into a painting thats shining in front of me.
The work is done and I go out again to find new inspiraton.

<h3>Welcome to Endless Art </h3>
<p>Hello, my name is Javaun Willis and my love for art and all creative things manifested at a very early age. Growing up I was always fascinated with superheroes and comic books and fantastical world building which made me want to sketch and draw and create. As I became older and more skilled I realized that the supplies became more expensive and the space I desired to work in was much larger than what I had available. Then before I knew it, I went off to school in Florida at Full Sail University to study computer animation. The special thing about Full Sail is that they had their facilities running 24/7, which meant there was always a place to work and I always had many tools and supplies at my disposal. After I moved back home to Indiana it was almost strange not having a place I could always go to escape and dive into my art. Which is why I want to create an open environment for people who live in a larger city such as Chicago, where space at home may be limited, or even just a place where you can clear your head and recenter your focus. I also know that for many artists, especially up and coming ones, resupplying your materials can become expensive. I want to create an affordable experience for not only professionals but also for young artists trying to build their brand. </p>
<p>All funding for Endless Art will go toward initial startup expenses, marketing, and pinpointing a location to setup shop. All contributions, no matter if its a dollar or if you decide to take part in one of the perks provided, will be vital to the development of this project. I'm prepared to take on this journey with you all, and whether the goal is met or not, any funding made will go toward the opening of the studio whether that be through bank services or other means. All that matters is that it starts here with you all and I just want to say thank you in advance for helping me pursue my vision.  </p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Hi Indiegogo!  </p>
<p>My name is Wolf Voigt and I'm the owner of a company called Glitter Hippo®.  Im a craft store fanatic like many of you and visit many retail hobby stores at least a few times a month.  About two and a half years ago I was trying to find glitter at my local Michael's craft store and saw there were really <u>no glitters that stood out</u>.  Yes, there were many colors but the packaging for all the brands available were very bland and the glitters were just not as amazing as I had hoped to find.  So, I asked myself the question, what if I created my own brand of glitter?  </p>
<p>I was on a mission to create my own glitter brand company so I contacted several manufacturers around the world,  who create glitters with unique properties, to bring all of them to one place to be offered.  Six months later, in July of 2015, <a href=""http://www.GlitterHippo.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.GlitterHippo.com</a> was founded.  When I first started the company we used zip lock bags with  sticker labels and although the business vision was there, the model was not where I wanted it to be.</p>
<p>Today, we have re-branded our Glitter Hippo® glitter with new packaging, a story of how the Glitter Hippos came to be and even have our line of Glitter Hippo® toys available!  With your help, we will be able to get Glitter Hippo® in retail stores across North America and have the best glitter available with the most attractive packaging! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Heres where you can help!</h3>
<p>We are seeking to raise $5000 to help purchase inventory and new packaging for our many different glitters.  The types of different glitters we have include: Holographic, Color Shifting, Glow in the Dark and so many more.  Because these glitters are different than the standard ones you see at your local hobby stores, they are also more pricey.  Our new packaging has the Glitter Hippos® in a huddle in the front of the package with a transparent hippo shaped window revealing the color glitter in each package and their story of how they came about on the back of each package.  The design will certainly gain the attention to anyone who is looking for the coolest glitter around!</p>
<p><strong><u>So what kind of Perks do we have?   AWESOME ONES!!!</u></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Glitter Hippo® brand glitters including: Holographic, Glow in the Dark, Color Shifting, Micro, Fluorescent, Shimmer, Matte and more!</li>
<li>Glitter Hippo® toy figures.  9 total colorways!</li>
<li>Glitter Hippo® Apparel! </li>
<li>And last but not least, our everlasting thanks for helping us fund our project and get Glitter Hippo® into craft stores near you!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Before we started the Indiegogo campaign we wanted to make sure our game plan was in place with our new packaging and perks to avoid having our supporters wait a long time to receive their perks.  We anticipate to have many of the perks out to our supporters within 30-60 days of the campaign ending</p>

A Yearly Origami Subscription Service for your company
We will create and pass along origami videos and diagrams for you to help spread the joy of origami to your staff, guests, clients, and friends.
 

What our plan is moving forward

This funding goal will help us purchase a new van, create decals and get out on the road spreading origami!
A newer van costs around 18,500$ and with the customizations and decals that our design team is working on now we believe that 25,000 is a reasonable goal.
Everyone who donates will receive gift, ranging from of our very own Japanese origami paper, to models that founder Taro Yaguchi folded himself!


The Impact

Since 2011 we have worked diligently to spread origami with projects in cities like New York, San Francisco, Orlando, Dallas, Los Angeles, Las Vegas and Denver.
This new Mobile Origami Studio will allow us to reach underfunded areas in our neighborhoods.


Other Ways You Can Help

</h3><p><strong>The Tarot of Saqqara</strong></p><p>Five thousand years ago in the sacred sands of the Sahara, on the west bank of the river Nile, the greatest Pharaoh of the Third Dynasty commissioned Imhotep to build the first pyramid of Egypt.  It was here at Saqqara during a trip in 1981 that Donald Beaman became inspired by the great monument which served as the necropolis for the ancient Egyptian capital of Memphis. It remained an important complex for royal burials and cult ceremonies for more than 3,000 years and it is here that the initiations of those seeking enlightenment were performed.</p><p>Using his skills as a professor of theatrical design at Boston University and from his study of sacred geometry, Mr. Beaman began to create images of the early systems of spiritual divination and transformation. His original paintings are composed on 36” x 52” wooden art board using acrylic, silver and gold leaf paints.  The final work is an elaborate collection of images derived from the architecture and knowledge of the earliest societies. They comprise not only an Egyptian influence but also that of the Kabbalah, Roman, and Celtic traditions. These paintings would eventually form an 82-card tarot deck entitled “The Tarot of Saqqara”.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1529978105/zljhjcjkyk9bgkdo8gfx.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><strong><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>The Deck</span></strong></p><p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>The Tarot of Saqqara is based on the traditional 78-card tarot deck on 3.5"" x 5.5"" cards. </span>The stock is light and flexible with a glossy sheen, while the backs have a reversible pattern that speaks to Prof. Beaman's understanding of sacred geometry. <span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'> There are four additional cards which are not to be used in an ordinary reading.

True American dream? It all started when I joined the U.S. Marines to serve my
country in the early 90's. Now there is something that seems to be common across all
branches....Tattoos. They are somewhat of a must in the military and now are
very main stream in today's society. This part is no big secret. The one thing
that eluded me when I wanted to get my first Marine Corps tattoo was where to
get it, how much is a good price, how do I know this is a reputable artist?
This business has seemed to be a mystery for some time. I found that even the
artists themselves find it very difficult to connect with a client base
efficiently. I started an on base publication for military personnel to see local artists and their work. The publication grew by leaps and bounds and was very popular. Then I was moved to California and didn't have the energy to restart this at a new base. I thought there has to be a better way. So after some years of research and planning(and major advances in the internet since 1991). Ink Badger was born.
Ink Badger is a patent pending software that allows clients who are looking for
A tattoo to upload a design and have multiple artists bid in your local area.
Each artist has their own profile page and is rated by prior clients. Once an
artist wins the bid, the client goes for the consult with their set price and
the confidence they are getting a great price from the right tattoo artist.
This also solves the problem of up and coming artist looking to break in the
business to find that customer that would never be able to find them. The site is completed and we are in beta testing phase now. Ink
Badger will also have an app that customers can upload a tattoo they currently
have for a cover up bid, as well as all the capabilities as the full site. All the technology is in place to get my dream off the
ground. Now we just need you to help us launch!!<div><br/></div><div style=""text-align: center;""><b>And please remember because of our military roots we believe in giving back.

SOLUTION




_____________________________________________________________________________


What we need is to get a complete setup for a convention tour we will be launching starting in May 2015 at Tattoo Mania. We have already became a major sponsor for the event.

This is where we will get the most exposure to the tattoo community in a small amount of time. The impact we need to make at these events has to be impressive. We need the money raised to purchase a traveling trade booth setup that is surprisingly expensive. One example is below of just the back drop wall that are close to $2100 alone.

You may be thinking I'm not a tattoo type. That's ok too. We still have some pretty great rewards for helping us get to our goal. From cool Ink Badger gear to custom shoes and tattoos, we have something for everyone. We have our own line of ""Love Ink Shirts""





We also have wireless speakers that look like soda cans, temporary tattoos, monthly subscriptions for artists, and advertising spots on our site and app for your business, and of course real chair time for someone to get a fantastic tattoo they have been dreaming of!

They are as varied in ethnicity, race, sexual identity and interests as their choice of artistic media. SometimesBeautiful empowers and redefines, both physically and cerebrally, the perception of beauty. </p><p></p><p>SometimesBeautiful challenges prescriptive beauty as defined by consumerism and media machines; and celebrates those who exude magnificence.

</div>","SometimesBeautiful is a celebration and contemporary analysis of the notion of beauty, defined by a selection of over fifty artists, primarily women, spanning the globe from New York, Philadelphia and Los Angeles, Berlin, Milan and Paris to Amsterdam, Seoul and Transylvania. They are as varied in ethnicity, race, sexual identity and interests as their choice of artistic media. SometimesBeautiful empowers and redefines, both physically and cerebrally, the perception of beauty. SometimesBeautiful challenges prescriptive beauty as defined by consumerism and media machines; and celebrates those who exude magnificence. This book considers such themes and is organized through the following tenets—Beauty, Fetish, Voyeur, Taboo, Distorted and Aversive.  The funds raised will be used to independently publish the SometimesBeautiful book.....Long term goals include using the book (distributed to innovative curators and museum directors) to secure a major traveling exhibition to include works from all artists in the book.Participating artists include:  Bruce Adams, American, Buffalo, NY; Cindy Baker,

<p></p>
<p>Hi there! My name is Blake Higgins and I'm an independent journalist who has been working on the story of Ken Botham Jr. for the last 16 months. Ken has been in prison for over 39 years for the murder of his wife Patricia, his neighbor Linda and Linda's two young boys Troy and Chad. However, his guilt has recently come into question, and it's possible there may be some viable DNA candidates to test that could prove his innocence.</p>
<p>I've decided to tell the story in a serialized first-person podcast called Junction. I released the <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/junctionpodcast/welcome-to-junction"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">first episode</a> at the end of April and have received a lot of great feedback. In order to tell the story properly, though, I need to be in Grand Junction, Colorado, (where this all took place in 1975) for the next six months to talk to everyone who was involved in the case.</p>
<p>And this story goes much deeper than just Ken's story. Eight women and children were murdered in Grand Junction in 1975. This was unprecedented for a small town of only 23,000 where only two murders had occurred in the past decade. I'd like to poke around and see what exactly was going on during the year locals still call 'the killing season.'</p>
<p>I want to tell this story so that Ken, the victims, the families of the victims and the whole town of Grand Junction can finally receive definitive answers about this case. I hope this story can provide some resolution for everyone involved. I also want to tell the most compelling story I can, because this is one of the most interesting stories I've ever come across.</p>

<h3>Historien om det tidiga 90-talets klubbscen i Stockholm, berättad av de som var med. <br/>
</h3>
<p>Det var fantastiskt, det var galet, och Stockholm skulle blivit helt annorlunda utan denna speciella epok.

<p>Stockholms omstart skedde de första åren på 90-talet, när en mängd kreativa och exhibitionistiska lycksökare från alla håll möttes på Stockholms klubbar, fulla av glädje, ambition och väldigt mycket attityd.

<p>Ni som var med vet vad vi menar. För alla er andra, här är chansen att upptäcka en svunnen värld fylld av avklädda och plastklädda klubbkids – de som blev dagens generation av media- och modechefer, regissörer, design- och nattklubbschefer. </p>

Vi behöver er hjälp att finansiera produktion och tryck av den hittills största och mest omfattande boken om Stockholms galna 90-tal. 



Historien om det tidiga 90-talets klubbscen i Stockholm, berättad av de som var med. 

Det var fantastiskt, det var galet, och Stockholm skulle blivit helt annorlunda utan denna speciella epok. Stockholms status som internationellt erkänt nav för design, mode, musik och it tas idag för given. Men för 25 år sedan var Stockholm mest känt för blondiner och isbjörnar utomlands.

Ni som var med vet vad vi menar. För alla er andra, här är chansen att upptäcka en svunnen värld fylld av avklädda och plastklädda klubbkids – de som blev dagens generation av media- och modechefer, regissörer, design- och nattklubbschefer.

Unika foton från 90-talets klubbar. Med nytagna foton och intervjuer 20 år senare.
Eftersom det inte riktigt ansågs coolt att gå på klubb med en kamera på 90-talet finns det inte mycket foton bevarade. Det handlade om att leva i stunden och det fanns inget behov att visa upp hur snygg man var eller hur kul man hade. Alla var ju där!Därför är det tur att Stefan Holm fick i uppdrag av klubbarrangörerna att under den stockholmska klubbexplosionens högtidsperiod – åren 1993-1995 – ta foton på de massiva Deep-festerna samt på klubbar som 2001 och Vegas.
20 år senare har vi sökt upp närmare 100 av det tidiga 90-talets klubbprofiler, intervjuat samtliga samt fotograferat dem på nytt, 20 år senare. Av detta har vi vävt samman den kollektiva historien om Stockholms glömda 90-tal, berättad av de som var med.

<p>Hi! I am
a freelance fashion illustrator currently juggling a full time job in a finance
office with my freelance illustration work.</p>
<p>Until recently I have worked mainly on private
commissions to friend and family. I also sell work online via New Blood Art.
However sales are sporadic and because I still work full time I don't have
enough time to produce work fast enough to sell regularly.</p>
<p>I was very lucky recently to be featured in Aesthetica
Magazine and as a result, have been invited to show at the Global Art Agency's
Miami Expo in June. I am over the moon to be invited but it’s going to be quite
a chunk of money to ship work and try to get there by myself.</p>
<p>This is an amazing opportunity for me to further my
career and maybe get one step closer to my dream of illustrating full-time; I
am looking for support towards the cost of getting myself and my artwork there.</p>
<p>The exhibition is a perfect platform for me to meet
other artists, galleries, art collectors and sponsors. Something I normally
wouldn't be able to do. I am sure that this could be a big break for me and
would be so thankful for any support.</p>
<p>If you can't sponsor me, but like my work please check
out my pages below, and share. All support is most welcome! </p>
<p>If I didn’t make my target, I would like you all to
know that the funds I did raise would go towards sending my artwork to the
exhibition by themselves, and anything extra would go towards producing more
work and towards publicising my work further.</p>
<p>please have a look at my work:</p>

</div></div>","Hi! I am
a freelance fashion illustrator currently juggling a full time job in a finance
office with my freelance illustration work.
Until recently I have worked mainly on private
commissions to friend and family. I also sell work online via New Blood Art.
However sales are sporadic and because I still work full time I don't have
enough time to produce work fast enough to sell regularly.
I was very lucky recently to be featured in Aesthetica
Magazine and as a result, have been invited to show at the Global Art Agency's
Miami Expo in June. I am over the moon to be invited but it’s going to be quite
a chunk of money to ship work and try to get there by myself.
This is an amazing opportunity for me to further my
career and maybe get one step closer to my dream of illustrating full-time; I
am looking for support towards the cost of getting myself and my artwork there.
The exhibition is a perfect platform for me to meet
other artists, galleries, art collectors and sponsors. Something I normally
wouldn't be able to do. I am sure that this could be a big break for me and
would be so thankful for any support.
If you can't sponsor me, but like my work please check
out my pages below, and share. All support is most welcome! 
If I didn’t make my target, I would like you all to
know that the funds I did raise would go towards sending my artwork to the
exhibition by themselves, and anything extra would go towards producing more
work and towards publicising my work further.
please have a look at my work:

<p>Hello!</p>
<p>My name is Morgan Bath, I am a recent graduate of the Art Studio BFA program. I am a 4th generation Canadian and due to a lack of income I have seen very little of my great country, because of this fact I have been planning and working towards a coast to coast road trip!

I have saved and raised just enough to make it coast to coast with very little wiggle room if I stop here and there to work small jobs along the way. </p>
<p>This campaign is to raise money so I can make it to the territories as well.  This trip is about experiencing the Canadian landscape and producing artwork in response to that. I'm not going to lie either.... I am also pretty excited to camp all summer! I will be visiting all the major city centres across Canada as well as any little places that look interesting along the way.</p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>If my funding goal is reached I will be able to :</p>
<p>           -  Make it to the Canadian territories</p>
<p>          -  Set up mentorships with senior artist and/or makers to further my                                  knowledge and Artistic practice</p>
<p>          -  Eat more than protein powder and cheap canned things</p>
<p>          -  Spend time in areas of inspiration to create artworks instead of having to                      stick to a very strict schedule in order to be able to make it home</p>
<p>          -  Explore artistic city centres across Canada for more then one day</p>
<p>          -  Afford to pay for ferries to islands along the coasts (such as Newfoundland &amp;              Labrador) </p>
<p>Even if I don't reach my entire goal I will be using the funding exactly for what the perk says I will! Well I may by a tea instead of coffee but other than that. It would be WONDERFUL to reach my funding goal but anything and everything will help so much. </p>
<p>I'm an avid journal writer and I'm sure with the lack of company on this trip my writing will be at an all time high! So most if not all of my perks come with a handwritten (or I may use my typewriter) letter.

Opening September 26, 2015 at <a href=""http://www.storefrontlab.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">StoreFrontLab</a> in San Francisco’s Mission District, the project features artists who explore a range of brain and body phenomena examined in Sacks’ research. These works present the influence Sacks has had on our understanding of the human condition in its limitless variation and form. <i><b>Indigo Mind </b></i>highlights distinct physical and neurological states, named after various publications written by Sacks: <i>A Leg to Stand On</i>, <i>The Mind’s Eye</i>, <i>Seeing Voices</i>, <i>Hallucinations</i>, <i>An Anthropologist on Mars</i>, and <i>Migraine</i>. Each week’s focus will feature artists working within these distinctions, inviting the public to engage in activities that shed light onto these unique experiences. </p><p>This project has been received with such open arms by the San Francisco Bay Area community and friends and followers of Dr. Sacks that it has grown into a celebration of great proportion. We are seeking lead sponsorship from organizations that align with our mission to connect the arts and disability communities, as well as support on any level from individuals who simply want to honor the impact Dr. Sacks has made through his work on the fields of creative, fine, and the performing arts. We welcome and are grateful for any help that you can offer.</p><p><i>*This exhibition is being mounted to honor the work of Dr. Sacks.

She explores the intersections of the physical, metaphysical, traumatic and illusionary through video, photography and sculpture.

She is humbled and honored to be co-curating this show in celebration of her lifelong literary hero, Dr. Oliver Sacks.</p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><b>Arianne Gelardin</b> is a San Francisco-based artist and curator. She works to dress the mundane with colorful moments and thoughtful interruptions, breaking us free from habitual attitudes and auto-responses.

The writings of Dr. Oliver Sacks has deeply influenced Arianne's work as she explores what it means to be fully human amidst a tide of ever changing realities. </span><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><b>What We Need?</b></p><p>We need you! We are looking to raise $15,000 by September 13, 2015. Ambitious, indeed, but with your help, we can do it! $15,000 will enable us to support the following:</p><p></p><p>-Travel expenses for artist Emilie Gossiaux to host a public Dinner and lecture / performance presenting her Brainport technology.</p><p>-Travel expenses for David Bufano, brother of the artist the late Lisa Bufano. David will speak on her behalf about how his sister overcame illness through dance and art. </p><p></p><p>-Workshops all over the Bay Area which engage in disability and creativity focussing on the color and feeling of Indigo: an Indigo dye bath, a beach walk and water color session, and a meditation in the gallery </p><p>NOT TO MENTION:</p><p>-Material and installation</p><p>-Event and marketing</p><p>-Rental fees</p><p>-Artist travel </p><p>-Artwork shipping</p><div>
<p>While we are setting our funding goal at $15,000, it will be flexible. This is not an all-or-nothing campaign. $15,000 is what we need to realize the project as we envision it, but should we fall short, the show will go on. We will humbly and gratefully use what we have available to communicate to the public the incredible influence Dr. Sacks has had on the arts and disability communities.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>We are tapping into a collective story, a collective consciousness, through art, through interpretation, metaphor and performance in order to expand and express fully what it means to be human, physically, mentally and emotionally, as a shared experience. We are teaming up with the Disability Visibility Project (StoryCorps), to archive our artists stories and let their voices be heard far and wide. We have partnered with the Exploratorium, uncovering past exhibitions that Dr. Sacks had direct involvement with.

</div></div>","Each of us is a singular narrative, which is constructed, continually, unconsciously, by, through, and in us―through our perceptions, our feelings, our thoughts, our actions; and, not least, our discourse, our spoken narrations. Biologically, physiologically, we are not so different from each other; historically, as narratives―we are each of us unique.  ― Oliver Sacks, The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat and Other Clinical TalesWhat is your story? What is our collective story? What does it mean to be part of―and contribute to―the multitude of experience that comprises the human condition? These are the questions Cara Levine and Arianne Gelardin, curators of Indigo Mind, have asked while developing an inspiring exhibition that explores and celebrates the pioneering work of neurologist Dr. Oliver Sacks.What is Indigo Mind?Indigo Mind is an ambitious group exhibition celebrating the work of neurologist Dr. Oliver Sacks. Opening September 26, 2015 at StoreFrontLab in San Francisco’s Mission District, the project features artists who explore a range of brain and body phenomena examined in Sacks’ research. These works present the influence Sacks has had on our understanding of the human condition in its limitless variation and form. Indigo Mind highlights distinct physical and neurological states, named after various publications written by Sacks: A Leg to Stand On, The Mind’s Eye, Seeing Voices, Hallucinations, An Anthropologist on Mars, and Migraine. Each week’s focus will feature artists working within these distinctions, inviting the public to engage in activities that shed light onto these unique experiences. This project has been received with such open arms by the San Francisco Bay Area community and friends and followers of Dr. Sacks that it has grown into a celebration of great proportion. We are seeking lead sponsorship from organizations that align with our mission to connect the arts and disability communities, as well as support on any level from individuals who simply want to honor the impact Dr. Sacks has made through his work on the fields of creative, fine, and the performing arts. We welcome and are grateful for any help that you can offer.*This exhibition is being mounted to honor the work of Dr. Sacks. Dr. Sacks has no direct role in the exhibition itself.  Cara Levine is a San Francisco Bay Area-based artist. She explores the intersections of the physical, metaphysical, traumatic and illusionary through video, photography and sculpture. Her work explores the effects chronic pain, namely chronic migraine has on her experience in the world. She is humbled and honored to be co-curating this show in celebration of her lifelong literary hero, Dr. Oliver Sacks.Arianne Gelardin is a San Francisco-based artist and curator. She works to dress the mundane with colorful moments and thoughtful interruptions, breaking us free from habitual attitudes and auto-responses. Arianne is Curator at StoreFrontLab, a community space for ideas and dialogue. The writings of Dr. Oliver Sacks has deeply influenced Arianne's work as she explores what it means to be fully human amidst a tide of ever changing realities. What We Need?We need you! We are looking to raise $15,000 by September 13, 2015. Ambitious, indeed, but with your help, we can do it! $15,000 will enable us to support the following:-Travel expenses for artist Emilie Gossiaux to host a public Dinner and lecture / performance presenting her Brainport technology.-Travel expenses for David Bufano, brother of the artist the late Lisa Bufano. David will speak on her behalf about how his sister overcame illness through dance and art. -Workshops all over the Bay Area which engage in disability and creativity focussing on the color and feeling of Indigo: an Indigo dye bath, a beach walk and water color session, and a meditation in the gallery NOT TO MENTION:-Material and installation-Event and marketing-Rental fees-Artist travel -Artwork shipping
While we are setting our funding goal at $15,000, it will be flexible. This is not an all-or-nothing campaign. $15,000 is what we need to realize the project as we envision it, but should we fall short, the show will go on. We will humbly and gratefully use what we have available to communicate to the public the incredible influence Dr. Sacks has had on the arts and disability communities.

The Impact
We are tapping into a collective story, a collective consciousness, through art, through interpretation, metaphor and performance in order to expand and express fully what it means to be human, physically, mentally and emotionally, as a shared experience. We are teaming up with the Disability Visibility Project (StoryCorps), to archive our artists stories and let their voices be heard far and wide. We have partnered with the Exploratorium, uncovering past exhibitions that Dr. Sacks had direct involvement with. We are also partnered with the Disability Unity Festival, held this year at San Francisco City Hall, to celebrate the community’s strength, and the special 25-year anniversary of ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act, 1990).

Hello, I am Anny and I am from Greece, Athens. I have been painting since I was 4 and I have kept doing so till now. I studied Arts at Brighton, England and I have participated in many art exhibitions in Greece and in Europe. I also do ceramics and have won many awards for my creations.

You will help me create some art that is quite rare to find and I am sure you'll love it!


The idea behind this project


Some years ago, when first started making these paintings, some people asked me if I can make a personalized zodiac sign painting instead of common ones. 
The following are examples of my work. Note that they are old sample paintings for customers that I have kept in my basement.
For example, a father who was taking care a lot of his kids, was a Gemini. So I made a male figure holding  two babies. It is showing that he is a father of two while also meaning his zodiac sign is a Gemini.







Another example, is of an owner of a grocery store. His sign is Libra. So I painted a man, dressed up as a grocery store owner holding a scale. Also, the sign name is painted on the right in Greek letters. But of course it can also be written in English or any other language.

Size of painting purchased (just to double check)

In what language you want the sign to be written
How the sign is spelled in your language
If you don't want the sing to be written or if you want your name. Your name can also be written with the Greek alphabet.

About the artists   After meeting at Burning Man in 2009, the team of Ruby Bettencourt and Jeff Howe quickly discovered that they shared not only a common desire to create, but also a similar sense of aesthetics and intentions.  Ruby's experience as a jewelry and fashion designer and Jeff's background as an architect come together when they create art for Burning Man.  Meeting in the middle between large buildings and human scale fashion,  they create medium sized sculptural projects as well as custom jewelry.  Exciting news!!! Ruby and Jeff's medallions were just featured in the new book titled, The Jewelry of Burning Man  This beautiful book showcases the history of jewelry on The Playa while sharing stories about the art of gifting.  This remarkable collection of images and writing is available for purchase on the Burning Man website at https://marketplace.burningman.com/product/jewelry-of-burning-man/From Ruby and Jeff -We both embrace the philosophy,Dream Big and Follow Your DreamsAs this has become a tradition, our dreams are bigger than our budgets. This year we are celebrating Ruby's 20th consecutive year at Burning Man.  We need your support to manifest our vision, and to commemorate her 20th dance around the man. To make a large wood sculpture for Burning Man 2015, we are again turning to the community for support.  To help finance the creation of Rendezvous, we have created an exquisite medallion based on aspects of the sculpture.   As perks for your generous donations we are offering numerous medallion packages and if you want to share in the experience of giving, we are now offering Gift Giver Sets.  With these jewelry packagesyou may share in the pleasure of GIFTING them year round to friends. The Rendezvous Medallion 2015We need to meet our goal before the event so we can afford the transportation of the finished sculpture.  If it wasn't for the last minute, there wouldn't be a Burning Man.  For your generous contributions we will be shipping medallions as soon as we can.These collectible jewelry pieces are a considerable investment in time and material for us, requiring almost as much labor as our sculptures themselves.  We do this because we love it, and we are counting on you all to make our dreams possible.Be sure to check out our website which showcases some of our work together athttp://steellovedesign.com  A number of our previous sculptures and some of our other medallions are available for purchase.  Please contact us directly if you are interested in any of the items you see on the site.  All of the proceeds from Steel Love Design funnel directly back into creating more art.Your generous donations will help to keep the momentum of our creative dance and foster our ability to inspire others through art.  We hope that with your help we can offset some of the cost of materials, transportation, and tooling required for us to continue following our dreams.Some of the items that your donations will help provide include:Structural and Finish WoodSteelLED LightingCNC Router Table UsePlasma cutting and welding consumablesRented workshop spaceRental of a truck and trailer to transport Rendezvous to and from Burning Man 2015After you have made your contribution please tell your friends, family, campmates, and cohorts about this exciting new sculpture.  Please share this on your facebook or twitter.

<div></div>
<p>Tacoma Art Museum proudly presents <i>Art AIDS America</i>, a groundbreaking exhibition that reveals, for the first time, how the AIDS epidemic indelibly changed American art, beginning in the 1980s. The exhibition provides a framework to honor our collective loss, and rightfully recognizes the creative community that galvanized to ignite social and political change. It reminds us that the crisis continues, and explains how the HIV legacy still influences artists today.</p>

<h4><strong> </strong></h4>
<h4>
<strong style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: initial;"">Q: Who is curating this exhibition?</strong><br/>
</h4>
</div>
</div>
<div>A: We have expertise and pioneering scholarship around this subject through our Chief Curator Rock Hushka and long-standing relationship with curator and scholar Jonathan David Katz, PhD. The co-curators <span style=""background-color: initial;"">have worked for more than 10 years to bring this exhibition to fruition. </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">They formerly worked together on the award-winning exhibition </span><i style=""background-color: initial;"">Hide/Seek: Difference and Desire in American Portraiture</i><span style=""background-color: initial;"">. </span>
</div>
<div>
<h4><strong> </strong></h4>
<h4><strong>Q: Who are some of the prominent artists in the exhibition? </strong></h4>A: Some widely recognized names are Gran Fury, Robert Gober, Felix Gonzales-Torres, Keith Haring, Jasper Johns, Annie Leibovitz, and Robert Mapplethorpe. Other names you may recognize are Mark Chester, Sue Coe, Chloe Dzublio, Karen Finley, Jim Hodges, Jenny Holzer, Peter Hujar, Bill Jacobson, Ann P. Meredith, Mark Morrisroe, Catherine Opie, Alon Reininger, Andres Serrano, Carl Tandatnick, Julie Tolentino, David Wojnarowicz, and many more.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>
<h4>
<strong style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: initial;"">Q: Why does the exhibition include contemporary pieces? Didn’t the epidemic end in the early 1990s?</strong><br/>
</h4>
</div>
<div>A: HIV/AIDS is still here. The ""AIDS cocktail"" (or HAART, Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy) became available in the 1994 as a treatment for the disease, but there is no known cure. A shocking 1.2-million Americans are living with HIV and approximately every 10 minutes, another American becomes infected.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>
<em><i>Art AIDS America</i> </em>explores how the creative community reacted in the early days of the epidemic, shifting American art toward a more autobiographical voice. It also explains that just as HIV/AIDS are still with us, artists today continue to reference the epidemic in their work.</div>
<div>
<h4><b><strong> </strong></b></h4>
<h4><b><strong>Q: Is the exhibition traveling to any other locations?</strong></b></h4>A: Yes! After the exhibition wraps up at Tacoma Art Museum on January 10, 2016, it will travel to Zuckerman Museum of Art, Kennesaw State University, GA, from February 20 - May 22, 2016, and then to The Bronx Museum of the Arts, NY, from June 23 - September 11, 2016. We hope to add a surprise new location in Chicago at the end of 2016!</div>

−Rosemary Ponnekanti, The Olympian

Thank You!We truly appreciate all the support we have received for this campaign. We were able to raise nearly $14,000 both through this site and through offline donations. Your contributions will go a long way toward helping Art AIDS America travel to museums across America: to the Zuckerman Museum of Art near Atlanta this spring, to The Bronx Museum of the Arts in New York this summer, and to Chicago at the end of 2016--stay tuned until we can reveal the name of that location! 



+About Art AIDS America


Tacoma Art Museum proudly presents Art AIDS America, a groundbreaking exhibition that reveals, for the first time, how the AIDS epidemic indelibly changed American art, beginning in the 1980s. The exhibition provides a framework to honor our collective loss, and rightfully recognizes the creative community that galvanized to ignite social and political change. It reminds us that the crisis continues, and explains how the HIV legacy still influences artists today.



“Art AIDS America is an epic and national treasure.”−Jen Graves, The Stranger 






Help TAM raise funds forArt AIDS America to travel!  By taking up this cause, you send a signal that challenging, richly layered exhibitions are a vital part of our national dialogue. Your contribution helps to cover exhibition, programming, and traveling costs. Help us bring this experience to others around the United States.

Through a whopping 127 works in a wide range of media and spanning 30+ years, visitors see how artists transformed pain and loss into activism, expressions of beauty, and portrayals of personal experience. Learn their stories of resilience, hope, and progress. The works represent diverse artists including the internationally acclaimed (Keith Haring, Robert Mapplethorpe, Annie Leibovitz, and more), those whose careers were tragically cut short by AIDS, and contemporary artists working today. 


See additional video updates in the Video Gallery, and visit the Tacoma Art Museum website for an in-depth look at the art and artists in Art AIDS America.

+Critical Acclaim

 


“The Art AIDS America exhibition is not to be missed. In fact, it’s one for the history books.”
−Trenton Straube, POZ Magazine 


“Memorable masterpieces, fresh perspectives, tragedy, hope, progress, and milestones both unsettling and inspirational are the order of the day in this exhibition that is ostensibly about how the AIDS crisis changed society -- but is really about how art can change the world.” 
−Shana Nys Dambrot, Huff Post Arts & Culture 

 “Uncomfortable, wistfully beautiful, and vitally important…”
–Christopher Harrity, Advocate.com  

“The early epicenter of the U.S. AIDS epidemic was white and gay neighborhoods in San Francisco and New York. Today those hardest his are largely black, Latino, poor... If many Americans are lulled into thinking HIV/AIDS has gone away, it’s because the people most affected are largely invisible to them – just like members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community had been at the pandemic’s beginning.”
−Mary Engel, Fred Hutch News Service 

""Art AIDS America...looks at how AIDS inserted itself into the art world's conversation, leading to some personal, local, and activist works. At the time, popular art wasn't all that biographical--consider Andy Warhol's screen-printed homages to consumerism, or Jackson Pollock's abstracted paintings. AIDS changed that. It spurred artists to use the medium to tell the world about their crisis."" 
−Margaret Rhodes, WIRED

“...Art AIDS America may be the most important, historically salient, stylistically diverse, and politically inspirational of them all.” 
−Shana Nys Dambrot, Huff Post Arts & Culture 

“Hushka and Katz argue that AIDS changed the very nature of art-making in the ‘80s. The urgency of the experience took priority over debates about art-world ‘isms.’ Practice outweighed theory.”
−Michael Upchurch, Seattle Times

+Frequently Asked Questions

 

Q: Who is curating this exhibition?



A: We have expertise and pioneering scholarship around this subject through our Chief Curator Rock Hushka and long-standing relationship with curator and scholar Jonathan David Katz, PhD. The co-curators have worked for more than 10 years to bring this exhibition to fruition. They formerly worked together on the award-winning exhibition Hide/Seek: Difference and Desire in American Portraiture. 


 
Q: Who are some of the prominent artists in the exhibition? A: Some widely recognized names are Gran Fury, Robert Gober, Felix Gonzales-Torres, Keith Haring, Jasper Johns, Annie Leibovitz, and Robert Mapplethorpe. Other names you may recognize are Mark Chester, Sue Coe, Chloe Dzublio, Karen Finley, Jim Hodges, Jenny Holzer, Peter Hujar, Bill Jacobson, Ann P. Meredith, Mark Morrisroe, Catherine Opie, Alon Reininger, Andres Serrano, Carl Tandatnick, Julie Tolentino, David Wojnarowicz, and many more.






Q: Why does the exhibition include contemporary pieces? Didn’t the epidemic end in the early 1990s?


A: HIV/AIDS is still here. The ""AIDS cocktail"" (or HAART, Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy) became available in the 1994 as a treatment for the disease, but there is no known cure. A shocking 1.2-million Americans are living with HIV and approximately every 10 minutes, another American becomes infected.




Art AIDS America explores how the creative community reacted in the early days of the epidemic, shifting American art toward a more autobiographical voice. It also explains that just as HIV/AIDS are still with us, artists today continue to reference the epidemic in their work.

 
Q: Is the exhibition traveling to any other locations?A: Yes! After the exhibition wraps up at Tacoma Art Museum on January 10, 2016, it will travel to Zuckerman Museum of Art, Kennesaw State University, GA, from February 20 - May 22, 2016, and then to The Bronx Museum of the Arts, NY, from June 23 - September 11, 2016. We hope to add a surprise new location in Chicago at the end of 2016!

 
Q: Can I donate offline?A: Yes! Offline gifts may be mailed or taken over the phone. Send to:


Development Department
Tacoma Art Museum
1701 Pacific Avenue
Tacoma, WA 98402 
 
Or call 253-722-2465




Q: What happens if TAM doesn’t raise all the money or exceeds the goal?
A: We will put all funds we receive towards the exhibition.




 


+Perk Questions
 
Q: When will I receive my perks?A: Perks will be mailed in December after the end of the campaign. We will notify you if there are any delays.




Q: How do I tell you what t-shirt size I want?A: When the campaign comes to an end, we will send you an email. Please reply with your t-shirt size and style preferences.


Q: How much is shipping? What if I’m an international donor?

A: Shipping is a flat rate of $5 for domestic orders and $8 for international orders, with two exceptions: the Art AIDS America Poster and ""Gran"" Swag Package.




Q: What if one of the perks I want is sold out?A: Due to the special, limited-edition nature of the perks, we have a finite number of each item. Make sure to get yours today by contributing now!

I am a senior at Hanover College with a major in English and a part of Hanover's Business Scholar Program. Between my junior and senior year I was required by the BSP program to do a project-based internship and this art book is the end-point of it. This is an art book drawn by illustrator and internship sponsor Kathryn Silver illustrating the world that my novel, Project Nocens, takes place in. Inside of the art book will (surprisingly) be art and also will include short stories that take place in the world of the Nocens. The book will provide as a guide book or prequel-esque to the universe before the novels themselves. </p>
<p>Now, the question I'm sure you're asking is: what is the novel series about? Plainly said: superheroes. The Nocens Saga is about a wealthy business man name Xavier Zachariah who has built the city up to the highest point it can be, only to destroy it simply because he can. His history of crimes is long, but mostly hidden, but it all goes back to a girl named Robin Windsor. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Robin went missing at the end of her freshman year of college and her roommate has been trying to figure out what happened to her ever since and everything points of Xavier. Everything. </span></p>
<p>In addition to the art book we are also offering you the first issue of the Nocens Saga's first comic book called the Children. It's about a girl named Nora who begins to investigate what is going on with her friend and everything isn't as innocent as she may hope.

<p>I know that 1000 dollars seems like a lot, and it is, but I have complete faith in this project to be backed for printing. However, I have a very small fanbase and am a fairly introverted person so it's hard for me to get the word out about my project. So some of the following things may create challenges: </p>
<ul>
<li>Getting the word out. Even if you can't contribute please please <i>please</i> share this project so that it can see the light of day. If you're a fan of superheroes, awesome art, and helping someone grow in their writing please share this project to others even if you can't contribute.

<li>Meeting our deadline. I'm going into my senior year and while technically my internship ends in September, this project will continue to go on until next year. </li>
<li>Shipping after everything is over with and complete will be a huge task for us to handle. There are some risks with that while though I have faith in our lovely post office, things do get lost in the mail sometimes. </li>

</div></div>","Now that the campaign is quickly coming to an end I want to assure you that any last minute contribution - big or small - will greatly help me to travel back to the U.S.-Mexico border soon to visit and photograph new artists !! And a big THANK YOU to my all my wonderful backers !!My name is Stefan Falke, I'm a photographer living in New York. I would like to invite you to contribute to the next phase of my ongoing project:LA FRONTERA: Artists along the US-Mexico Border.From the moment I set foot in Tijuana in November 2008 I realized that the border region would become the most compelling material of my life as a photographer. I recognized that all the news about violent crimes told only a small part of life along the border. My discovery of a vibrant art scene flourishing back then was a great inspiration, and I urgently wanted to share its story. I have already photographed over 180 painters, muralists, sculptors, performance artist, poets, gallery owners and curators south (and some also north) of the US border in Matamoros, Reynosa, Nuevo Laredo, Ciudad Juarez, Nogales, Mexicali, Tecate, Tijuana as well as San Diego, El Paso, McAllen and Brownsville.Here is my short video about the beginning of my work on the border:The LA FRONTERA project continues.
I'm planning to revisit some of the 180 artists on the U.S.-Mexico border whose work has had the most impact on their communities and produce in-depth interviews and videos about their lives and their art. Finding new artists will also be part of my expanded La Frontera project. 

The interviews, photographs, and videos will be published on the website borderartists.com, which will re-launch with a visually richer, updated and interactive design. I am also working on a book for the US and Mexico, which will include the new material. 
The new educational and entertaining website will be the heart of my LA FRONTERA project. I will invite art museums and cultural institutions from both sides of the border to add their calendars and other content to the site, and individual artists can to link to their work. An app for smartphones and tablets is planned.


Your contribution will help to accomplish this.

My long term goal is to create an online community around the website that will forge cultural connections along the entire 2,000-miles-long border.




I feel passionate enough about this project to ask you for your help. Here is what I need:
Funds for roundtrip air fare from New York as well as for lodging, car rental, and video equipment for three separate trips:
1. New York - Brownsville/McAllen/Matamoros/Reynosa/N.Laredo
2. New York - El Paso/Cidudad Juarez
3. New York - San Diego/Tijuana/Tecate/Mexicali
If funds permit I will include other border towns and cities, especially the city of Piedras Negras, since the state of Coahuila is not represented in my project yet !!
(and please contact me if you have any questions at stefanfalke@mac.com)
I appreciate you in advance!

<div>Hi, we are excited to introduce Vancouver's newest, free outdoor festival, Vines Art Festival. Vines intention is to allow a platform for sharing and connecting through art in the outdoors. With a focus on involvement of artists and audience alike. There are 20 artists/artist groups  (dance, theatre, visual art, music) that will be performing and engaging on August 22nd from 12 PM - 6 PM at Trout Lake Park in Vancouver. To see a full list go to <a href=""www.vinesartfestival.com%C2%A0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">vinesartfestival.com</a>. </div> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div>So far Vine's has been able to raise funds through sponsorship and a silent auction. However this is only enough to cover the bare minimum costs, event permits and insurance. So that leaves us with an empty park space. I want to be able to pay the artists for their work as well as have supplies to put on free workshops for anyone to take a part in. This is where you come in. All funds raised through this campaign will be split using a profit-sharing model for the artists. In return you will be able to witness a full day of art and workshops for FREE! </div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>My hope is to encourage people to
acknowledge how lucky we are to have these beautiful outdoor parks in
Vancouver. Allowing for thought about how we treat the nature around us directly and indirectly. I also want inspire others to creatively immerse
themselves in the beauty of our surroundings. I imagine through watching artists create others will want to express themselves
more. Vines can create a space where people won’t feel scared about not
understanding what it is that is going on and just give it a try.</p>
<p>A second aim is to expand Vancouver's <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">art audience. I see a need to find new ways to inspire Vancouverites to watch
and understand the power of creation and expression. </span>Vines will create an approachable platform for
new audiences to connect to artists imaginations and joy.     <br/></p>

acknowledge how lucky we are to have these beautiful outdoor parks in
Vancouver. Allowing for thought about how we treat the nature around us directly and indirectly. I also want inspire others to creatively immerse
themselves in the beauty of our surroundings. I imagine through watching artists create others will want to express themselves
more. Vines can create a space where people won’t feel scared about not
understanding what it is that is going on and just give it a try.
A second aim is to expand Vancouver's art audience. I see a need to find new ways to inspire Vancouverites to watch
and understand the power of creation and expression. Vines will create an approachable platform for
new audiences to connect to artists imaginations and joy.     

    Other Ways You Can Help  If you can't contribute that doesn't mean you can't help:  Get the word out and make some noise about Vines. Share the campaign on social media.
