</div><h3>What is Confessional?</h3>
<p></p>
<h4>Confessional is<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> like getting to sit in an episode of
Eastenders, except it’s the best episode ever, as it was written by Tennessee
Williams.</span>
</h4>
<p>Confessional is a one-act play set in a seaside bar which Tennessee wrote towards the end of his career. It's a superbly-written play about a group of wonderful, broken characters over the course of a single evening.  We're restaging Confessional in a modern British seaside pub (think Blackpool or Southend) and the play will be semi-immersive, so the audience can sit and drink while the action unfolds around them.<span><span><br/></span></span></p>

3 days ago our Edinburgh Fringe play, Confessional by Tennessee Williams, was going to be cancelled as a sponsor had pulled out. You saved us by giving over £3,500 in 3 days. 
Thank you! We are genuinely moved by the support we got in such a short space of time.
Now we want to bring back a project we had to cut, the Two Day Drama School for youth and long-term unemployed people.

The Two
Day Drama School project will give up to 30 young and long-term unemployed people
two days of professional acting training. 
5 people will then be picked by audition for a shared part in the play you helped to save, Confessional by Tennessee Williams.
The project aims at helping unemployed
people build confidence and gain practical skills that will help them in job interviews,
as well as giving them a chance to try acting.
5 unemployed people who will complete the Two
Day Drama School will share the role of a police officer on different
nights through the second half of Confessional’s 24 nights run at the Edinburgh Fringe 2015. 
The play, which is set in a seaside bar, follows the fortunes of a group
of low-lifes through the course of a single evening.


What the Two Day Drama School will cover

The Two Day Drama School will give up to 30 youth and long-term unemployed people in Scotland a flavour of the traditional conservatoire drama school training.  We'll cover:


Different acting techniques, such as Stanislavsky and Method Acting, Meisner, and Michael Chekhov.
Voice and accent work.
Movement work. 
Shakespeare.
Analysing text and line learning.
Industry knowledge and audition technique.


Drama school is every bit as crazy as you probably imagine. You spend time rolling around on the floor, pretending to be seaweed. You find yourself with your head on a middle aged man's thigh, while you act out a scene from a surrealist painting. You learn about your body and your voice. You learn how to experience emotions you never knew you had, and to explore the most sublime words ever written.

As well as being a really fun experience, this will help build the students' confidence, and give them transferable skills. After all if you can project your voice on stage and come across confident in auditions, then it will make interviews a lot easier.

After they've completed the training, anyone who wants to will be invited to audition to share a small part in Confessional by Tennessee Williams, the play you helped to save.

It's a 4-line part of a police officer, which can be taken on by any gender, age, or ethnicity, and we'll aim to give 4 or 5 people a go at taking on the role for 2 or 3 nights each.
Jack Silver, the play's director: “We were always as excited about the Two Day Drama School as we are about putting on Confessional.  We would be honoured to be able to give people the chance of experiencing acting and to be able to help them gain the confidence that it can bring: this is a highly useful transferrable skill. It’s not necessarily about turning out 30 professional actors, but if we find the next Ewan McGregor or Karen Gillan, we’ll be delighted.”

We are were screwed.. but you saved us 3 days ago we were screwed.  Our main sponsor had pulled out and we had no way to afford to put our play, Confessional by Tennessee Williams, on at the Edinburgh Fringe.
But..
Our amazing group of friends saved the show. 
In less than 3 days an amazing group of 103 people donated £3,580 to help save the show.
We are gobsmacked. We are so, so thankful.
And now we've seen how how amazing the support has been, we're going to be cheeky and ask for more.
But there's a good reason.
One of the really, really tough decisions we had to make last week was to cut an amazing project we were hoping to put on the Two Day Drama School.
The Two Day Drama School had always been something we wanted to put on. It would be amazing to give something back to Edinburgh and to a group of disadvantaged people.
But last week when we were facing the prospect of not even having a play at Edinburgh, trying to organise a drama workshop seemed impossible.

But this week we've seen the impossible happen. In 3 days. So we'd like to push our luck and see if we can make the impossible happen twice in a week.


    The Impact If we can put the Two Day Drama School on it'll help a group of disadvantaged people in Edinburgh get some much-needed confidence, something to put on their CV, and some transferable skills that might just help them land a second interview or even a job.  And you never know, we might just uncover the next Hollywood A-Lister!
What is Confessional?

Confessional is like getting to sit in an episode of
Eastenders, except it’s the best episode ever, as it was written by Tennessee
Williams.

Confessional is a one-act play set in a seaside bar which Tennessee wrote towards the end of his career. It's a superbly-written play about a group of wonderful, broken characters over the course of a single evening.  We're restaging Confessional in a modern British seaside pub (think Blackpool or Southend) and the play will be semi-immersive, so the audience can sit and drink while the action unfolds around them.
""Out of brokenness shines unexpected beauty""

   
The cast of Confessional by Tennessee Williams is:

  
Lizzie Stanton as Leona Dawson 
Ray Bethley as Monk 
Joshua Leese as Bill McCorkle

Simone Somers-Yeates as Violet

Jackie Lam  and Chris Mills sharing the role of Steve

Abi McLoughlin as Doc

Tommy Rowlands as the Young Man

Ben Moos-Golding as the Boy

A Two Day Drama School Student as the Police Officer


Here's the blurb from the fringe programme..
""Share a drink with a group of shameless lowlifes and watch their lives implode. This innovative, immersive production reimagines Tennessee Williams's play in a British seaside bar, frequented by life's flotsam and jetsam. Join the regulars over the course of a furious and fun evening, as a pair of strangers enters their world and all hell breaks loose. 
""Written in 1970, Confessional features Williams's first openly gay character and arguably his most sympathetic female character: needy beautician, Leona.""",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

I have long been a lover of architecture and, as a dancer, found my ""footing"" within performance by paying attention to spatial nuances and shifts. As a dear friend once recounted, the first thing I do when entering a room is figure out where I want to be within it. Intersecting my passion for dance's daily practices, the complexities of domestic space, and a very important apartment in Detroit, please explore the details of this project and come for a performance! All performances are FREE and open to the public with <a href=""https://www.eventbrite.com/e/it-never-really-happened-part-one-solo-tickets-15608196536"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">RSVP</a>.<br/></p><p>Thank you,</p><p>Biba</p><p><br/></p><p><b>About the Project</b>
</p>
<p>“It Never Really Happened” is a dance 
performance set in the fifth floor corner apartment of a 1958 Mies van 
der Rohe high-rise in Lafayette Park, Detroit. It offers a singular 
event for the public to experience dance, domesticity, and modernism's 
classic architecture. In the fashion of a cocktail party, the two-hour 
long event opens up a private space to a small audience (15-20 persons),
 exposing the apartment as a space of intimacy, visibility, and 
aestheticized leisure. The choreography infiltrates the apartment, 
combining all attentions in the room to create a shared space of 
spectacle. Each performance of “It Never Really Happened” is a 
personalized secret that endures through its audience as a time capsule 
housed by memory.
</p>

performed at sunset during three seasons (Winter, Summer, Fall), and its
 three parts transition from a solo to a duet to an ensemble/party. 
Offering 5-8 performances per installment (15-24 
performances total), they are each organized around a different mood, 
architectural element, time of day, and seasonal color. The dance 
activates the classic modernism of Van der Rohe’s architecture, 
highlighting the drama of day-to-day rituals against
 its panoramic backdrop. Looking out over the 
backdrop of Detroit's downtown, Eastern Market, and Lafayette Park, the 
events will give the public a chance to sit back and experience their 
city from a new perspective, welcomed within the dancer's home. Guests 
are invited to watch the seasons of the city through a very rare and 
important window. In a place that can seem so rough and harsh at ground 
level, slightly elevated - at tree height - there is an overwhelming 
contact with nature and the nonchalant beauty of the city.

Bell, this project brings together a group of Detroit-based 
collaborators and performers. The music is conceived in collaboration 
with musician and dj Scott Zacharias. In addition to the series of 
performance events, a three-channel video of documented footage will be 
created for future exhibition in collaboration with video artist 
Christine Hucal. Part One (Solo) is performed by Bell and Part Two 
(Duet) and Part Three (Ensemble) collaborates with Detroit-based dancers
 and performers.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><b>A Dance for the Community</b>
</p>
<p>“It Never Really Happened” offers the public a
 new, exciting experience of dance and architecture. Considered an 
international architectural gem, Lafayette Park is a neighborhood 
consisting primarily of private residences, which rarely offers public 
access within its residential spaces. This series of events will open up
 one of these private spaces to a larger public, giving its audience a 
chance to experience an evening inside its singular architecture. 
Inviting guests from within the neighborhood and beyond, the performance
 will contribute to an existing sense of community while celebrating it 
with a larger public, connecting the local and city-wide with a 
regional, national, and international stage. </p>

audiences in Detroit for contemporary dance and performance, expanding its 
reception and exploring the public, social reach of the form. At the
 same time, it extends a sustainable approach to the continued 
performance of a dance, where, instead existing within the house of the theater, it invites this audience into its home. The dance can be performed multiple times, 
night after night, mirroring the daily practice of everyday life that

I have long been a lover of architecture and, as a dancer, found my ""footing"" within performance by paying attention to spatial nuances and shifts. As a dear friend once recounted, the first thing I do when entering a room is figure out where I want to be within it. Intersecting my passion for dance's daily practices, the complexities of domestic space, and a very important apartment in Detroit, please explore the details of this project and come for a performance! All performances are FREE and open to the public with RSVP.Thank you,BibaAbout the Project

“It Never Really Happened” is a dance 
performance set in the fifth floor corner apartment of a 1958 Mies van 
der Rohe high-rise in Lafayette Park, Detroit. It offers a singular 
event for the public to experience dance, domesticity, and modernism's 
classic architecture. In the fashion of a cocktail party, the two-hour 
long event opens up a private space to a small audience (15-20 persons),
 exposing the apartment as a space of intimacy, visibility, and 
aestheticized leisure. The choreography infiltrates the apartment, 
combining all attentions in the room to create a shared space of 
spectacle. Each performance of “It Never Really Happened” is a 
personalized secret that endures through its audience as a time capsule 
housed by memory.

photo: Christine Hucal, 2014Organized as a triptych, the piece is 
performed at sunset during three seasons (Winter, Summer, Fall), and its
 three parts transition from a solo to a duet to an ensemble/party. 
Offering 5-8 performances per installment (15-24 
performances total), they are each organized around a different mood, 
architectural element, time of day, and seasonal color. The dance 
activates the classic modernism of Van der Rohe’s architecture, 
highlighting the drama of day-to-day rituals against
 its panoramic backdrop. Looking out over the 
backdrop of Detroit's downtown, Eastern Market, and Lafayette Park, the 
events will give the public a chance to sit back and experience their 
city from a new perspective, welcomed within the dancer's home. Guests 
are invited to watch the seasons of the city through a very rare and 
important window. In a place that can seem so rough and harsh at ground 
level, slightly elevated - at tree height - there is an overwhelming 
contact with nature and the nonchalant beauty of the city.

Early rehearsals with dancer Michelle Brock, photo: Biba Bell, 2013Spearheaded by choreographer and artist Biba 
Bell, this project brings together a group of Detroit-based 
collaborators and performers. The music is conceived in collaboration 
with musician and dj Scott Zacharias. In addition to the series of 
performance events, a three-channel video of documented footage will be 
created for future exhibition in collaboration with video artist 
Christine Hucal. Part One (Solo) is performed by Bell and Part Two 
(Duet) and Part Three (Ensemble) collaborates with Detroit-based dancers
 and performers.A Dance for the Community

“It Never Really Happened” offers the public a
 new, exciting experience of dance and architecture. Considered an 
international architectural gem, Lafayette Park is a neighborhood 
consisting primarily of private residences, which rarely offers public 
access within its residential spaces. This series of events will open up
 one of these private spaces to a larger public, giving its audience a 
chance to experience an evening inside its singular architecture. 
Inviting guests from within the neighborhood and beyond, the performance
 will contribute to an existing sense of community while celebrating it 
with a larger public, connecting the local and city-wide with a 
regional, national, and international stage. 
Early rehearsals with dancer Chris Woolfolk, photo: Biba Bell, 2013This project is also committed to developing 
audiences in Detroit for contemporary dance and performance, expanding its 
reception and exploring the public, social reach of the form. At the
 same time, it extends a sustainable approach to the continued 
performance of a dance, where, instead existing within the house of the theater, it invites this audience into its home. The dance can be performed multiple times, 
night after night, mirroring the daily practice of everyday life that 
takes place both within and outside our domestic lives. 
""It Never Really Happened"" was developed during a series of home residencies and a three-hour performance at the Visual Arts Center, University of Texas at Austin, Oct/Nov 2013.Dispersal of FundsThe monies accumulated in this campaign go towards matching a grant awarded by the Knight Arts Challenge, a community-wide contest supporting ideas that engage and enrich Detroit supported by the John S. and James L.

<p><i>Contus de Janas, or fairy tales </i>is an original dramaturgy which was born from Carla Stara and Laura Tassi's need to explore feminity. The authors tried to purify the idea of being a woman from speculation, approximation and any kind of commercialization. The attempt is to explore femininity - which is an ambiguous, cryptic and eradicated concept - through the characters of the play. Female and male archetypes arise from the Sardinian legend of the Janas. The Janas are half fairies and half witches creatures, tiny and delicate but with sharp nails and magic powers. The characters of the play are reminiscent of the Janas: they guard precious treasures, weave with gold spinning wheels and protect newborns. Two stories are intertwined with the fairytale of the Janas. The first story, which is set today, is about a young man and a young woman who have to make a very important decision about the inheritance of an old atelier, in an eternal struggle with future and choices. The second story focuses on the first encounter between Gilda, a bourgeois and kept woman, and Morena, a former prostitute who emigrated from Sardinia to Northern Italy seeking her fortune. <br/></p>

zusammenbringt. Es ist eine Arbeit, bei der es darum geht,
die Gemeinsamkeiten zweier Kulturen zu untersuchen, mit denen sich die
Regisseurin und Dramatikerin <b>María Luisa Stille</b> als Deutsch-Argentinierin
identifiziert. Sie hat bisher in Argentinien gelebt und gearbeitet, und ist
nach Berlin gekommen um mehr über die Kultur ihrer Eltern zu lernen. Mit
<i>Movidito Movidito</i> sollen die Ähnlichkeiten 
der Migrationsprozesse in Argentinien (zu Beginn des zwanzigsten Jahrhunderts) und Europa (heutzutage) untersucht werden. </p>

</div>","Kurzbeschreibung

Versión en castellano: http://kunstrial.org/cultura-kunstrial/movidito/Movidito Movidito ist ein Theaterstück, das verschiedene
Themen der deutschen und der argentinischen Kultur und Migration
zusammenbringt. Es ist eine Arbeit, bei der es darum geht,
die Gemeinsamkeiten zweier Kulturen zu untersuchen, mit denen sich die
Regisseurin und Dramatikerin María Luisa Stille als Deutsch-Argentinierin
identifiziert. Sie hat bisher in Argentinien gelebt und gearbeitet, und ist
nach Berlin gekommen um mehr über die Kultur ihrer Eltern zu lernen. Mit
Movidito Movidito sollen die Ähnlichkeiten 
der Migrationsprozesse in Argentinien (zu Beginn des zwanzigsten Jahrhunderts) und Europa (heutzutage) untersucht werden. 


Fast alle, die an diesem Stück mitarbeiten, haben im Laufe ihres Lebens erfahren, was es heißt, MigrantIn zu sein. Unsere Schauspielerin Tanja Watoro kommt aus Deutschland,
hat aber viele Jahre in Bolivien mit dem Teatro de los Andes gearbeitet, die Band Feierabend Poetic Cumbia, besteht aus
argentinischen und chilenischen Musikern, die in Berlin leben,
unser Komponist Manuel Funes lebt in Argentinien, komponiert die Stücke von
dort aus und arbeitet mit uns über Skype zusammen. Unsere Bühnen- und
Kostümbildnerin Leonore Lukschy kommt aus Berlin und hat in Argentinien im Teatro María Castaña gearbeitet und für María Luisa Stille, deren Stücke in Lateinamerika mit zahlreichen Preisen ausgezeichnet wurden, ist Movidito Movidito die erste große Regiearbeit in Deutschland. Unterstützt wird das Projekt von KUNSTRIAL e. V. – ein Verein, der seine Arbeit dem kulturellen Austausch zwischen Deutschland und Lateinamerika widmet.
In der argentinischen Provinz Córdoba entstand aus
verschiedenen musikalischen Einflüssen der europäischen Einwanderer in der
ersten Hälfte des zwanzigsten Jahrhunderts die Cuarteto Musik, die während der Militärdiktatur 1976 - 1983 verboten und 2013 schließlich offiziell als immaterielles Kulturerbe Córdobas anerkannt wurde.
Movidito Movidito erzählt die Geschichte einer Tochter von
Immigranten, Eleonora, die als Kind den ersten Cuarteto-Auftritt miterlebt. Sie
verliebt sich nicht nur in diesen neuen Rhythmus sondern auch in einen der
Musiker und die Liebe zu ihm bestimmt maßgeblich den Verlauf ihres Lebens. Sie
wird Zeugin wichtiger Ereignisse, die Córdoba und Argentinien bis
zu Beginn der Militärdiktatur 1976 prägen. Die Cuarteto Musik begleitet sie
dabei.


Es geht bei dem Projekt vor allem darum, eine
neue Sicht auf die argentinische Kultur fernab des Tangos zu schaffen und zu
zeigen, wie die Musik und der Tanz Begegnungen zwischen unterschiedlichen Kulturen
möglich machen, die bis auf das Land, in dem sie leben, nichts gemeinsam haben. 
Wir arbeiten mit deutschen Texten, die Lieder werden jedoch auf Spanisch gesungen. Der Cuarteto steht historisch für die Kommunikation über Sprachbarrieren hinweg, für die argentinische Arbeiter- und Studentenbewegung und ist heute vor allem ein Rhythmus zum Tanzen und Feiern –
das soll auch dem Publikum übermittelt werden. Und so heißt es in dem Stück: Um
eine bessere Welt schaffen zu können, muss man sich schließlich auch amüsieren.

Was du uns gibst & was du bekommst
Um unser Projekt erfolgreich über die Bühne bringen zu
können, brauchen wir Mittel um unter anderem einen Probenraum, die Kostüme, das
Bühnenbild, unsere Schauspielerin und unsere Musiker zu bezahlen. 
Wir laden Euch dazu ein, Teil dieses Projekts zu werden, in
dem die Früchte der kulturellen Vielfalt, die Musik, das Theater,
Migrationsprozesse, historische Ereignisse und natürlich die Liebe zu einem
unvergesslichen Erlebnis zusammenkommen.
Als Dankeschön bekommt Ihr von uns Poster, exklusives Behind-The-Scenes-Material, den Soundtrack auf CD und habt sogar die Chance bei einer Probe live oder über Skype dabei zu sein!


Die Folgen

Je größer Eure Unterstützung, desto mehr Aufführungen können wir finanzieren, und unser Ensemble angemessen für seine harte Arbeit entlohnen. 
Nachdem KUNSTRIAL e. V. in Zusammenarbeit mit dem Goethe-Institut in Bogotá erfolgreich das Theaterstück Waldemarwolf auf die Bühne gebracht hat und in Berlin die Filmfestivals Invasion Buenos Aires - Berlin und Panorama Colombia unterstützt hat, soll Movidito Movidito das erste von vielen Theaterprojekten in Deutschland sein.

<h2><b><span style=""color: #6B1A6A;"">The show ""Anamnèse""</span></b></h2><p align=""justify""><i>""Anamnèse""</i> is a unique visionary show that brings both humor and poetry to the stage.<br/>
<b>The show is an invitation to remember</b>. Bringing the audience into the feeling of remembering. Remembering becomes both an intimate and collective journey.
  A distant voice tells a story. A story, about the intimate relationships we have with our memories. <br/>
This story passes through time, emotion, and experience; focusing on everyday life, and the movement of forgetting.<br/>
Throughout the show, the dancers drift from one memory to the next, depicting various worlds, tones, and sensations.<br/>
<b>Blending modern dance and contemporary with more whimsical styles, joyfully integrating acting and drumming all together</b>. <br/>

Those memories that are stamped inside of our flesh; they are bound to our essence. Many of us know all too well that memories can also be far from shining doorways to a joyous past. Sometimes we feel the need to escape our memories, or push them away trying to forget what happened, or once was. But what if we decide to face them? Is it a dare?</p><p align=""justify""><b>In the second part of the show we are doing a research on very well know topics such as nostalgia, daily-life and oblivion.</b>   <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Sometimes memories wash over us like a wave of euphoria.

</p><p></p><h2><span style=""color: #6B1A6A;""><b>La démarche artistique</b></span></h2>
<p align=""justify"">Claudine et Inbar se sont rencontrées à Tel Aviv en 2014 alors danseuses pour Orly Portal Dance Company.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Au rythme des tournées, elles ont pris le temps de se raconter leur histoire, d’évoquer leurs souvenirs. </p>
<p align=""justify""><b>Deux femmes tellement différentes qui aujourd’hui vivent sur une même Terre… Claudine, née à Marseille et Inbar à Ein Gedi … Et pourtant tellement semblables.</b></p>
<p align=""justify""><b>L’envie de créer ensemble, d’explorer le sujet de la mémoire ou plus précisément des mémoires est née comme une evidence. </b></p>
<p></p><h3><span style=""color: #3F0432;"">Le thème de la mémoire</span></h3>
<p align=""justify"">La recherche d’Anamnèse repose sur la relation intime que l’on entretient avec nos souvenirs et avec le temps.</p>
<p align=""justify""><b>Dans la première partie du spectacle, on considère que les souvenirs façonnent le corps et l'être à part entière. </b>On associe les souvenirs à des empreintes indélébiles qui font ce que nous sommes. On s’intéresse au mouvement explosif, intrusif de ces mémoires. Elles apparaissent sans prévenir, elles se révèlent brutalement. Il est question de mémoires dites pré-natale ou infantiles. </p>
<p align=""justify""><b>Dans la seconde partie du spectacle, on aborde des thèmes très connus: La nostalgie, le quotidien et l’oubli. On y explore plus précisément notre relation au temps.</b></p>
<p align=""justify"">Il est alors question de mouvement volontaire. Quand on part à la cueillette de souvenirs sur fond de nostalgie ou encore lorsque l’on se met en « pilotage automatique » répétant sans cesse ces habitudes tellement humaines que nous choyons tous.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Enfin, on considère que de la répétition naît la mutation. Et si l’oubli de l’anamnèse, était l’unique moyen de danser sa vie ? </p>
<p></p><h3><span style=""color: #3F0432;"">Le procédé de création chorégraphique en studio</span></h3>
<p align=""justify""><b>Anamnèse utilise un procédé unique de création et l’imagerie mentale* en est le pilier ( Inspirée de La Méthode Franklin*). </b></p>
<p align=""justify"">Les idées sont explorées lors de séances d’improvisation guidées. A partir d’une recherche de mots, de verbe ou de textes, Claudine propose un travail autour des sensations qu’ils éveillent. </p>
<p align=""justify"">La question est de chercher à écouter la sensation que l’imagination fait naître et vice-versa. S‘établit alors un dialogue constant entre la pensée et la sensation corporelle. Tout est intrinsèquement lié : L’imaginaire, l’émotion, la posture et l’équilibre. </p>
<p align=""justify"">Chacune des danseuse apporte une perspective unique, s’inspirant de son expérience personnelle, de ses propres inspirations et de son approche kinesthésique. </p>
<p></p><h3><span style=""color: #3F0432;"">Mise en scène et autre plaisir</span></h3>
<p align=""justify""><b>La mise en scène a été imaginée puis écrite par Claudine comme un script de film. </b> <b>Elle est ensuite façonnée en studio par l’ensemble de l’équipe.</b> </p>
<p align=""justify"">Anamnèse se construit et évolue ainsi comme une histoire avec l’ensemble du groupe. </p>
<p align=""justify""><b>Les costumes sont non seulement un plaisir visuel permettant l’illusion mais sont aussi les pièces maîtresses du décor</b>. Ils sont une métaphore de mémoires désincarnées.</p>
<p align=""justify""><b>Les créations originales, musique et lumière sont inspirées du Surréalisme.</b> Il s’agit de jouer avec les frontières entre le réel et l’affabulé, comme dans un rêve.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Enfin, les spectateurs sont invités après le spectacle à une exposition virtuelle de photos sur le site internet du projet. L’idée étant de prolonger leur souvenir, leur expérience…</p><p align=""justify""><br/></p><p align=""justify""><br/></p>

Claudine Crosta is the founder of ""Anamnèse"" project. Inbar Walter joined as co-choreographer. The project includes a community of international artists, decided to strengthen all artistic endeavors they embark on in the future.
As a new immigrant in the country, Claudine felt the urge to offer a vision of what is actually happening in the Israeli Artistic Scene. So many artists coming from so many different places choose to come to Israel in the mood for sharing their memories and passion, in the mood for creating... People need to know what's happening here, people need to connect to this Wonderfull Wave of Endless Inspiration. The idea is to be part of this incredible movement: To facilitate and support the collaboration between all the young international artists living in Israel. 
Claudine and Inbar are two professional dancers that met in TLV. After a year performing and touring « Rabia » in Orly Portal Dance Company, they decided to start a research process about the sensation of remembering. To dive deeply into sense-memory, through movements.
We deeply trust that « Anamnèse » is only the first step in what will develop into a full artistic partnership. We all have a big vision about what our group will be tomorrow.

The artistic researchWe are investigating the intimate relationship that we do have with memories and time, bringing on stage the scenarios of our lives.In the first part of the show, we are working on hidden memories. Those memories that are stamped inside of our flesh; they are bound to our essence. Many of us know all too well that memories can also be far from shining doorways to a joyous past. Sometimes we feel the need to escape our memories, or push them away trying to forget what happened, or once was. But what if we decide to face them? Is it a dare?In the second part of the show we are doing a research on very well know topics such as nostalgia, daily-life and oblivion.   Sometimes memories wash over us like a wave of euphoria. Sometimes they surge through us momentarily overpowering our sensibilities. But it can be to a point that we become confused with what is real and not real. We are re-writting the scenario of our life. We are interested in the movement of repetition. Our daily routines, habits and « addictions » could be a way for us to control the Time. Repeating seems the only way of dealing with being alived. But what if we decide to forget? Forgetting could be the only way to live the moment. The metamorphosis can arise from the repetition… The costumes, hanging from the ceiling are the stage set. It’s a metaphore of disembodied memories. All the changing costumes are happening on stage, acting. Dancers are embodying old memories, dealing with them at the present.  The lighting and music soundtrack are inspired by « Surrealism » ( Artistic way of creating in the 1920’s) . Talking about the border between what is real and what is not, as in dreams. After the Première and all the shows, the audience will be invited to a virtual photo exhibition on our website. A way to invite them to … Remember… ""Anamnèse"" utilizes a unique, collaborative creation process. The core of the process is a specific use of mental imagery, what we call Dynamic Imagery* ( Inspired by The Franklin Method*).

L’envie de créer ensemble, d’explorer le sujet de la mémoire ou plus précisément des mémoires est née comme une evidence. 
Le thème de la mémoire
La recherche d’Anamnèse repose sur la relation intime que l’on entretient avec nos souvenirs et avec le temps.
Dans la première partie du spectacle, on considère que les souvenirs façonnent le corps et l'être à part entière. On associe les souvenirs à des empreintes indélébiles qui font ce que nous sommes. On s’intéresse au mouvement explosif, intrusif de ces mémoires. Elles apparaissent sans prévenir, elles se révèlent brutalement. Il est question de mémoires dites pré-natale ou infantiles. 
Dans la seconde partie du spectacle, on aborde des thèmes très connus: La nostalgie, le quotidien et l’oubli. On y explore plus précisément notre relation au temps.
Il est alors question de mouvement volontaire. Quand on part à la cueillette de souvenirs sur fond de nostalgie ou encore lorsque l’on se met en « pilotage automatique » répétant sans cesse ces habitudes tellement humaines que nous choyons tous.
Enfin, on considère que de la répétition naît la mutation. Et si l’oubli de l’anamnèse, était l’unique moyen de danser sa vie ? 
Le procédé de création chorégraphique en studio
Anamnèse utilise un procédé unique de création et l’imagerie mentale* en est le pilier ( Inspirée de La Méthode Franklin*). 
Les idées sont explorées lors de séances d’improvisation guidées. A partir d’une recherche de mots, de verbe ou de textes, Claudine propose un travail autour des sensations qu’ils éveillent. 
La question est de chercher à écouter la sensation que l’imagination fait naître et vice-versa. S‘établit alors un dialogue constant entre la pensée et la sensation corporelle. Tout est intrinsèquement lié : L’imaginaire, l’émotion, la posture et l’équilibre. 
Chacune des danseuse apporte une perspective unique, s’inspirant de son expérience personnelle, de ses propres inspirations et de son approche kinesthésique. 
Mise en scène et autre plaisir
La mise en scène a été imaginée puis écrite par Claudine comme un script de film.  Elle est ensuite façonnée en studio par l’ensemble de l’équipe. 
Anamnèse se construit et évolue ainsi comme une histoire avec l’ensemble du groupe. 
Les costumes sont non seulement un plaisir visuel permettant l’illusion mais sont aussi les pièces maîtresses du décor. Ils sont une métaphore de mémoires désincarnées.
Les créations originales, musique et lumière sont inspirées du Surréalisme. Il s’agit de jouer avec les frontières entre le réel et l’affabulé, comme dans un rêve.
Enfin, les spectateurs sont invités après le spectacle à une exposition virtuelle de photos sur le site internet du projet. L’idée étant de prolonger leur souvenir, leur expérience…

Challenge
Anamnèse est un projet ambitieux qui a commencé il y a 5 mois. Aujourd’hui, l’auto-financement met en danger le bon déroulement du processus de création. Des fonds doivent être investis afin de permettre à notre groupe de poursuivre ce processus à la hauteur de notre ambition. 
L’ensemble de notre groupe vous remercie chaleureusement pour votre soutien et votre contribution.Suivez-nous sur notre site internet : http://anamnese.website

""Properly Produced Productions’ mission is to bring a new understanding of ourselves and others through the creative outlet of live theatre. We want to encourage, stimulate and celebrate others creativity by producing new works, helping others develop new shows and taking well known shows and giving it our own vision and heart. We want to create a great creative bond between all artists in the community.""
    Risks & Challenges Theatre is a risky business and consistently changing as it is a living thing a creative conglomeration of talent together to create wickedly awesome art. Being in the field for just over 18 years I have had several successful productions and several learning opportunities to help guide me where I am today. I have managed and directed theatre groups in that past and established a theatre group in a charter school. Some Producing credits include; Broadway in My Backyard: Broadway Under The Stars and Cinderella a Twisted Drag Fairy tale.

That’s a powerful response. Now imagine if it could be evoked through a surprisingly entertaining theatrical performance. That’s the idea behind Near Death Experience.</p><h3><strong>How we get there</strong></h3><p>Without our fascination with death, much of our popular entertainment wouldn’t exist (think of all the films built around blowing things up and throwing fictional bodies everywhere). But off the screen, most of us find it a difficult subject to address, let alone to accept and respond to in a meaningful way.</p><p>Near Death Experience uses the tools of humor, magical and psychic performance, and interactive theatre to bring audience members into a conversation about mortality that’s never threatening and actually kind of fun. They’re brought gradually closer and closer to the subject until, by the show’s climax, they have the opportunity to feel personally involved in a theatrical Near Death Experience that might leave them positively transformed.</p><h3><strong>Even the location helps</strong></h3><p>Since bringing people closer to the subject of death is the whole point, even some of our performance locations are part of the show: every element of Near Death Experience is designed to work on the premises of actual funeral homes! This charges performances with site-specific excitement that begins with the audience’s very act of crossing the threshold into the show space.</p><h3><strong>(Safely) heart-stopping climax</strong></h3><p>The climax of the show involves the entire audience living vicariously through me as I go through— per the promise in the show’s title—a Near Death Experience. As a lifelong student of magical and psychic performance with particular emphasis on its darker areas (hence my performance character’s title of Necromancer), I’m uniquely suited to performing feats that seem to skirt the edges of our mortal limits before returning myself and my audience to safe ground.</p><h3><strong>Cemetery Resolution books</strong></h3><p>Part of the show involves the use of custom-printed props: books which are handled by members of the audience. Depicting a virtual cemetery stroll with the Necromancer, the books are filled with original photographs which, in addition to being beautiful on their own, are captioned with meaningful text suggesting the kind of resolutions one might make when surrounded by reminders of life’s brevity—resolutions for taking advantage of the “bonus time” we all have.</p><p>After the show, these books will be available to audience members, to extend contemplation of their Near Death Experience. Through this Indiegogo campaign, they are also available under ""Perks"" in advance of the show, to keep for yourself or to give as gifts (you'll have to use your own best judgment as to who would be pleased to receive such a thing from you).</p><h3><strong>Rooted in interactive theatre success</strong></h3><p>Near Death Experience as an interactive theatre piece didn’t just come out of the blue. Over the past 15 years, I’ve been writing, producing, and performing a series of successful interactive and magical theatre shows dealing with serious subjects in entertaining ways.</p><p>The Houdini Seance (2001) brought audience members into contact with the spirit of the late magician as well as personal spirits of their own, within a theatrical reconstruction of a traditional Victorian séance. This solo show ran every Halloween for 13 years. “Here’s your chance to have an old-school, creepy Halloween.” <i>Red Eye Chicago</i></p><p>Supernatural Chicago (2004) ran every week for 10 straight years—making it one of the longest-running solo shows in the city's history—as it immersed audience members in sometimes-unsettling historical stories of the paranormal. Site-specific, it drew some of its power from its setting within a reputedly haunted landmark building. “Is it real? Or isn’t it?” <i>Chicago Tribune</i></p><p>Palace of the Occult (2015) transported audience members to the 1933 Berlin grand opening of the titular performance salon, where they were treated as the personal guests of Erik Jan Hanussen, a Jewish psychic performer struggling to survive during the rise of the Nazis. “Highly recommended—The fascinating true story related by the trickster is enough to leave us spellbound.” <i>Windy City Times</i></p><p>Near Death Experience carries my work a major step further.

(For a more traditional show, that would barely cover theatre rental!) Even if we don’t hit our entire goal through Indiegogo, we could get close enough to generate buzz and inspire other sources to kick in.</p><h3><strong>Goodies for you</strong></h3><p>Any amount would help, of course, but since souvenirs are fun, here’s a peek at some of the incentives (see the “Perks” section for the full list):</p><p>$50 Book—Before the show even opens, get an advance autographed copy of the Near Death Experience book, Cemetery Resolutions. Lovely photos, inspiring text, messy signature: it’s a trifecta.</p><p>$125 Script—Get an autographed, stapled (unbound) working copy of the Near Death Experience show script. Imagine the eBay value of this when the show wins the Tony for Best Fun-And-Interactive Show About Death.</p><p>$300 Contributor Package—Get your name on the Contributors page of the show’s official website (neardeathx.com), and also receive the Script/Book/CD Combo. That'll impress your next date, for sure.</p><h3><strong>It’s not all about money</strong></h3><p>If you have a personal, inside contact at a funeral home or theatre space in Chicago, New York or Los Angeles who would be interested in hosting a performance or two, you could be a Necromantic Venue Facilitator. That is one sexy title, so drop a note to neil@necromancerevents.com with your info and theirs. If it turns into a booking, you’ll get your name in the printed program and the right to put that little conversation starter on your resume.</p><p>Even if you don't know anybody in the funeral or theatre worlds, you can still help by telling all your friends about this breakthrough show in person, by phone, and through your favorite social media. Indiegogo has some handy sharing tools, so feel free to use those too!</p><p>Let’s help make a difference in people’s lives—by giving them a Near Death Experience.</p></div>","The power of “bonus time”When people are brought to the edge of death and back again, an incredible thing happens: they often see the days and years afterward as a gift—“bonus time” to use for living life more fully.

Even if we don’t hit our entire goal through Indiegogo, we could get close enough to generate buzz and inspire other sources to kick in.Goodies for youAny amount would help, of course, but since souvenirs are fun, here’s a peek at some of the incentives (see the “Perks” section for the full list):$50 Book—Before the show even opens, get an advance autographed copy of the Near Death Experience book, Cemetery Resolutions. Lovely photos, inspiring text, messy signature: it’s a trifecta.$125 Script—Get an autographed, stapled (unbound) working copy of the Near Death Experience show script. Imagine the eBay value of this when the show wins the Tony for Best Fun-And-Interactive Show About Death.$300 Contributor Package—Get your name on the Contributors page of the show’s official website (neardeathx.com), and also receive the Script/Book/CD Combo. That'll impress your next date, for sure.It’s not all about moneyIf you have a personal, inside contact at a funeral home or theatre space in Chicago, New York or Los Angeles who would be interested in hosting a performance or two, you could be a Necromantic Venue Facilitator. That is one sexy title, so drop a note to neil@necromancerevents.com with your info and theirs. If it turns into a booking, you’ll get your name in the printed program and the right to put that little conversation starter on your resume.Even if you don't know anybody in the funeral or theatre worlds, you can still help by telling all your friends about this breakthrough show in person, by phone, and through your favorite social media. Indiegogo has some handy sharing tools, so feel free to use those too!Let’s help make a difference in people’s lives—by giving them a Near Death Experience.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

</p><p><b>Dear
Friends, </b></p>
<p><b>For
the past 4 years, we have been developing (researching, composing, writing,
workshopping) a brand new opera-theatre work based on the life of legendary dancer
and femme fatale Mata Hari. In many ways, this is the biggest undertaking of
our careers yet, because of the size of the piece and our vision for this work.
With the support of the HERE Artist Residency Program, we’ve grown the piece
from an idea to a full production, and in January 2017, the piece will have its
world premiere in PROTOTYPE, the premier global festival of opera-theatre and
music-theatre in New York City, co-produced by HERE and Beth Morrison Projects.
</b></p>
<p><b>Now
is the time when you can ensure the project’s success! </b></p>
<p><b>On
September 17, 2016, We will walk
the length of Broadway</b> in Manhattan to raise the final $14,000 <span><span></span>of
the production’s budget, which will allow us to compensate all of the artists
involved in the creation of this work at an appropriate level. This is not your
ordinary fundraising campaign, where we simply ask for your support—we are
asking you to sponsor a section of the walk. From the northern most point of
Manhattan, Broadway Bridge at West 220<sup>th</sup> Street, to the southern tip
at Battery Park, Broadway encompasses 14 miles and 280 blocks. With your
partnership, we will walk that length as a sign of our commitment to this
project and our collaborators. </span></p>
<p>We hope you’ll be a part of this
effort! </p>

</p><p><b><i>Mata Hari</i></b><i>,</i>
a world premiere opera, is inspired by the legendary and controversial female
mystic dancer who was executed for espionage during World War I. Created by
director/librettist Paul Peers and composer Matt Marks, this original work
disrupts the traditional operatic form through a layering of physical theater,
unconventional instrumentation, found texts, and highly manipulated video
design. Born <span>Margaretha Geertruida Zelle, part
of the Frisian minority of the Netherlands in 1876, Mata Hari concocted a new
life for herself after years of being dominated by an oppressive husband by
becoming a renowned mystic dancer. Her career as a dancer simultaneously made
her infamous, as both a great artist—promoting female self-determination
and liberation—and as a whore and eventual traitor. Set during Mata Hari’s
final months of life in prison in Paris, <i>Mata Hari</i> tells the story of a
woman who finds herself ostracized, made a scapegoat, and executed by a
moralistic society dominated by men. <br/></span></p><p><b><span>The Artists</span></b></p><p><span>Cast: Tina Mitchell, Mary MacKenzie, Jeff Gavett, Daniel Neer, Joshua Jeremiah, Steve Hrycelak and Michael Marcotte.</span></p><p><span>Instrumental Ensemble: Mila Henry, James Moore, Helen Yee, Kamala Sankaram.</span></p><p><span>Creative Team: Neal Wilkinson (Set), Oana Botez (Costume), Lucrecia Briceno (Lighting), David Jonathan Palmer (Projection) and Isaac Jones (Sound Engineer).</span></p><p><span>Choreographer: Anabella Lenzu</span></p><p><span>Stage Manager: Aislinn Curry<br/></span></p><p><span>Conductor: David Bloom <br/></span></p><p><span>Composer Matt Marks</span></p><p><span>Director/Librettist: Paul Peers<br/></span></p>

2017</b></p>
<p>We are extremely excited to be
included in PROTOTYPE 2017. This is the fifth installment of this annual
festival of visionary opera-theatre and music-theatre works by pioneering
contemporary artists from New York City and around the world. The festival is
the only one of its kind in the United States – presenting original
genre-bending works by both emerging and career artists. PROTOTYPE occurs for
two weeks in January during national and international conferences of
presenters. This allows presenters and directors from around the world to see
the work and ideally bring it to their own venues, <b>extending the life and reach
of a work like Mata Hari and furthering the careers of artists like us. </b></p>
<p>The Festival has provoked the <i>New York Times </i>to call it
“invaluable…vibrantly theatrical, genre-blurring, unusual in its techniques,
eclectic in its musical style and politically charged” and <i>Time Out New York </i>noted that “HERE and Beth Morrison Projects prove
that thrilling opera continues to bloom.”</p>
<p>The ability to create ambitious
works of opera-theatre like Mata Hari remains a long-term creative and career
goal of many up-and-coming individuals working in the field. However, the
successful creation of these complex and challenging art forms is a difficult
goal to achieve: projects like this are costly in both time and resources. <b>This
is an important step in our careers—to not only mount this work, but be

<p><b>The walk will point out the needs

</p></div>","Dear
Friends, 
For
the past 4 years, we have been developing (researching, composing, writing,
workshopping) a brand new opera-theatre work based on the life of legendary dancer
and femme fatale Mata Hari. In many ways, this is the biggest undertaking of
our careers yet, because of the size of the piece and our vision for this work.
With the support of the HERE Artist Residency Program, we’ve grown the piece
from an idea to a full production, and in January 2017, the piece will have its
world premiere in PROTOTYPE, the premier global festival of opera-theatre and
music-theatre in New York City, co-produced by HERE and Beth Morrison Projects.

Now
is the time when you can ensure the project’s success! 
On
September 17, 2016, We will walk
the length of Broadway in Manhattan to raise the final $14,000 of
the production’s budget, which will allow us to compensate all of the artists
involved in the creation of this work at an appropriate level. This is not your
ordinary fundraising campaign, where we simply ask for your support—we are
asking you to sponsor a section of the walk. From the northern most point of
Manhattan, Broadway Bridge at West 220th Street, to the southern tip
at Battery Park, Broadway encompasses 14 miles and 280 blocks. With your
partnership, we will walk that length as a sign of our commitment to this
project and our collaborators. 
We hope you’ll be a part of this
effort!

<h3>""Girls don't like metal."" -some idiot</h3>
<p>NOT TRUE.</p>
<p>Sign of the Beast Burlesque is perhaps the most well known and unique burlesque troupe in Portland Oregon. We've been producing and performing in full length cabaret style shows featuring incredible performers and heavy metal music since 2010, when troupe was formed by local legend ""Miss Metal Portland"" Vera Mysteria. Since then, co-producers Rocket and Hai Fleisch have taken the troupe to new heights, making the show more epic every year.  So far we've had some incredible performances:  babes bathing in giant goblets of blood, high flying aerial artist witches, murderous mermaids, and a tiny naked woman riding a giant stuffed tiger, just to name a few. </p>
<p>In 2016, we wanted to share our love of metal and performance art with a larger audience and a more diverse group of performers. We cranked up the volume on our favorite Slayer record, thought long and hard about how we could achieve this goal.....and the idea for the first ever Metalesque Fest was born! The fest incorporates three days of badass performances, live metal music from local bands, an air guitar contest, workshops, and networking events.</p>
<p>If you are a believer in the power of burlesque has to change lives and you love metal music, this fest is for you! It's rare to see women ""take the lead"" in the metal music scene, and here is a group of women so in love with the music and it's power that they have produced an entire show (for six years now) dedicated to it! So many women absolutely love metal, and our troupe and guest performers from around the country are ready to rock out! Thank you for helping us make our goal a reality!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>How can you help?</h3>
<p>...and what do you get?</p>
<p>We put our nose to the rhinestone and had an amazing fundraising show earlier in 2016. Although it helped us raise a good deal of money, we are still in need of more funds to nurture this show into reaching it's full potential. We must pay our performers, musicians, and staff for the countless hours of work, love and practice they have put in to make this fest a reality. In addition, we have venue fees and transportation costs. This is where you come in! Your contributions help us to facilitate the behind the scenes costs associated with Metalesque Fest.</p>
<p>In return, we have some amazing Sign of the Beast Burlesque merch and VIP perks we'd like to offer you to say THANK YOU!</p>

<h3>Who We Are:</h3>
<p>Since its founding in 1998, Innervation Dance Cooperative has been finding ways to meld the art forms of theater and dance. The spirit of Innervation Dance Cooperative is one of artistic diversity and cohesive energy. Each dancer and choreographer has a unique background, allowing the company to incorporate multiple disciplines of dance and theater through the combined artistic vision of each member. One of our greatest strengths is the eclectic creative aesthetic produced by encouraging any and all company members to contribute to the creative output of IDC. IDC company members range from dancers fresh out of college, to veterans who have been part of the Chicago dance community for decades. Individuals at both ends of that spectrum and everywhere in between bring unique perspectives to the table.</p>
<p>To date, we have fostered the creativity of over 120 choreographers in the Chicago Dance Community!  Innervation Dance Cooperative is currently also an Artist in Residence at Links Hall and a verified 501(c)(3) non-profit that brings educational outreach to Chicago area schools.</p>
<h3>Why This Show Is Different:</h3>
<p>This show is something completely new for IDC!  We are breaking the fourth wall, creating our own stage space, and making use of materials in a way that we have never done before.  We are also covering subject matter that is near and dear to many of our hearts which makes this show that much more special to us as a company. While we are using ""Through the Looking Glass"" as our source material, much of the story-line and characterization has been lovingly created from scratch by members of our Artistic Cooperative.  We are meeting with mental health professionals to make sure our dancers are portraying an accurate representation of the characters we are creating. We are also creating an environment where the audience is very much involved in the show, you are no longer just a spectator.  This show will be the culmination of not only months of hard work in rehearsal but months of long, hard research and introspection on the part of the company as well.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What Your Funds Will Go To:</h3>
<p>Venue and Rehearsal Costs</p>
<p>Props, Set, and Costuming</p>
<p>Equipment for a multimedia based performance (projectors, LEDS)</p>
<p>Compensation for our Designers (sound, lighting, etc), Dance and Fight Choreographers, and Dancers</p>

<p>The Story</p>
<p>After Lincoln's assassination, very soon after, the government and the press conspired to tie up the loose strings surrounding the guilty, declare the case neatly solved and the villains all executed.</p>
<p>Nearly 40 years after the official version of the death of Lincoln's assassin, an alternate history emerged! A man claiming to be John Wilkes Booth made a deathbed confession. The ""Curse of Booth"" tells that story. Part mystery, part adventure, part romance. But is it the Truth?</p>
<p>This is the story of the handsome, acclaimed young actor John Wilkes Booth; loved by many woman, living in high society. What could have led him to throw his glamorous life away and commit  his horrendous crime? Who was really behind it. Someone else was shot in the barn! How did he escape ..... no one could kill him. He outlived everyone and died by his own hand in 1903.</p>
<p>But is it the truth?</p>
<p>The Impact</p>
<p>The story, as we tell it, is inspired by the 1908 book by Finis Bates and there is evidence, even beyond what we present. There is the agreement among the descendants of the large Booth family and of descendants of John Wilkes himself.</p>
<p>What we present exposes as mythology what passes for history and topples idols from their enshrined pedestals.</p>
<p>What We Need</p>
<p>We work-shopped at Tisch. We showcased at The Player's Club. Thanks to the response we're creating the multimedia show.</p>
<p>The medium and the message fit perfectly. The action takes place between the time Booth completes his will and his suicide. Booth reviews his life and the audience shares his experience  through projections that emerge on stage as they flash through his mind.</p>
<p>I am  as inspired by the artistic challenge of mixing of live performer and projections as I have been by the subject matter, the script and actors. We need YOUR help to bring this next phase to fruition.</p>

<h2>Who I am and What the Campaign Is</h2>
<p><strong>Introducing myself and my background:</strong></p>
<p>Hi, I’m Cynthia Clay, the artistic director of Storycrafter Studio. I’ve been on international TV as a Shakespeare expert because I passed the Turing Test. I made people think I was a computer program on Shakespeare. I direct, act, and write plays. I received early training from my mother who had trained at the Goodman under David Itkin who worked with Stanislavsky. I also received a degree in theater from Brandeis University (with Latin honors), attended the National Theater Institute at the O’Neil Center, and received an MFA in acting from the University of Georgia. Oh, my dad was also in the theater. He was a director and professor of theater. He and his best friend Daniel Krempel wrote the internationally acclaimed book on theater, <i>The Theatrical Image</i>.</p>
<p><strong>My campaign and why it's important to me:</strong></p>
<p>I love theater, so I opened a theater where I can direct plays by local playwrights, and write plays specifically for the incredible talent that is here in South Florida. Something I’ve really been wanting to do is a Spanish Language play. Miami is a bi-lingual city and I want to welcome everyone to Storycrafter Studio. I also dedicated to gender parity. For those of you unaware it, most plays (more than 75%) are written and directed by men. In the world of music, they tried an experiment. They had the musicians play behind a screen so that they would be accepted into the symphonies based on their playing, not whether they were men or not. From symphonies being filled with more than 75% men it went to 50% men, %50 women. Clearly before that experiment, many of the best musicians were not included in symphonies. The same is true for the theater.</p>
<p><strong>The magnitude of what contributors will help me achieve:</strong></p>
<p>Actors have to brave Miami traffic, sometimes for more than an hour to get to rehearsals and performances. If I had funding, I could pay the actors better, so they would have more than gas money for their artistry and I could attract more actors. If I had funding, I could do more advertising to grow our appreciative audience. If I had funding, everybody would be talking about and going to Storycrafter Studio.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>How much funding we need and where it's going:</p>
<p>Rent is $1350.00/month and each show needs two months for auditions, rehearsal, and performance. Utilities are $100/month in the winter, and more in the summer (we are in Miami!).  Even doing minimalist sets, the sets, lights, costumes, props  all cost $1000/show. I pay the actors and the stage manager for each show, so I need a minimum of $1500.00/show. So for just two shows with casts of four, I need $10000.00</p>

She spent her summers training with America’s top Shakespeare company, and after tasting every aspect of theatrical production — from ushering to costuming to performing tech — she fell in love with the idea of directing.  In the winter of 2016, the concept for Inspirata came to her. Although she nurtured this dream for months, it wasn’t until that summer that she met the people who now make up the family that is Inspirata.  Through a journey of midnight meetings, copious amounts of coffee, and piles of paper, they established a plan for their flagship production of William Shakespeare’s Titus Andronicus.  At this point in time, the arts are more important to local communities than ever.  Because of this, we as a company believe it is our duty to produce shows which reflect current events the society at large.  We believe that Titus provides an honest commentary which can be applied to the chaotic nature of our current political life and non-stop media coverage.  Titus will allow us to fully explore the idea of artistic relevance and the role of the social audience in a world forever in conflict with itself and each other.  OUR FUNDRAISER In preparation for this flagship production we are co-launching our annual community fundraiser.

<p>The 24 Hour What The...?</p>
<p>What is the 24 Hour Musical? We produce a full-scale musical in 24 hours.</p>
<p>""But how? and why? and how?""</p>
<p>Here's the how:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Pick a show (done!)</p>
<p>Hold auditions... without telling anyone what the show is</p>
<p>Cast the show... without telling anyone what their roles are</p>
<p>Release a shortlist of 10 shows, 10 days from the performance</p>
<p>Remove a show from the list each day until...</p>
<p>Bring the musical theatre community of Greater Brisbane together for 24 hours of mayhem and mirth!</p>
<p>Have a fancy dinner and ANNOUNCE THE SHOW</p>
<p>24 HOURS LATER, THE CURTAIN GOES UP!</p>
<p>Take all the profit we made from ticket sales and donations on the night, and give it away to local charities in need. Which charities? That's going to be up to you.</p>
<p>Go home and sleeeeeeeep...</p>
<p>And here's the why:</p>
<p>Because we can. Because it's a challenge. Because it's a project to build and strengthen community. Because working together is AWESOME. Because we can raise money for good causes. Because why not?! Because it will be the experience of a lifetime! Because all the reasons you could possible come up with!!</p>
<p>Everyone involved will have their own reasons for wanting to be part of this exciting (slightly crazy) project, these are just a few of ours - what's yours?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What We Need...</p>
<p>Our starting goal is $4,800 to cover the performance rights, venue hire and insurance for this event. These are the essentials to confirm that the project can go ahead.</p>
<p>Any funds raised beyond that will go toward production costs - i.e. costumes, sets, props, technical equipment and possibly even special effects and bonuses (see our stretch goals below)!</p>
<p>Essentially, the more funds we can raise before we start, the better we can make the production; and furthermore, the less costs we need to cover with ticket sales, the more potential we have to raise community donations on the night.</p>
<p>STRETCH GOALS:  Once we hit our campaign goal, here's what else happens when we raise even more funds*:</p>
<p>$6,000 - we provide free programs to the audience</p>
<p>$10,000 - we waive the production fee for participants</p>
<p>$12,500 - we provide a supper for the audience following the performance</p>
<p>$15,000 - we add an impressive ""special effect"" to the production</p>
<p>$17,500 - we produce a 24 Hour Musical documentary</p>
<p> </p>
<p>...&amp; What You Get</p>
<p>Most of our Perks include tickets to the show, starting at $24. Whether you think you'll use them yourself or pass them on to friends (for instance, if you're cast in the show!) investing in pre-purchasing tickets through the perk helps to ensure the project has enough support to go ahead. </p>
<p>Some perks (starting at $48) include VIP tickets - here and now is the only way to get your hands on VIP passes! VIPs get priority seating meaning not only do they get the best seats in the house, but they are allowed into the theatre 30mins before curtain, when last minute rehearsals may still be going on!</p>
<p>For those who want to be even more involved, check out the higher level perks that include joining us for the announcement dinner, sitting in on rehearsals or even being touted as the Producer!</p>
<p>Q: What if I want to audition or volunteer to work on the project? Why would I select a perk that includes tickets I might not be able to use?   A: The perks are all fully transferable - if you select a perk with tickets or special access and then you are cast in the show, you can pass those tickets on to family or friends to use. Remember, your contribution is funding the project in the first place, and if we don't reach our goal it may not go ahead!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What Your Contribution Means To Us</p>
<p>By helping to fund this project, you become part of our local theatre community. We hope that an annual event like this can become a great networking opportunity for the many growing and flourishing companies in the greater Brisbane area.</p>
<p>And... the more money we raise before we start, then the more we can raise on the night for our charitable causes! Everyone who attends will be able to nominate where project profits are donated by 'donating' their ticket stub to either of our selected charitable causes. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>What If We Don't Make It???</p>
<p>If the campaign doesn't reach the goal, then we thank you for your generous contributions and put them toward covering as many of the costs as we can.</p>
<p>We recognise that some things may not go to plan, even so, we will do everything within (and slightly beyond!) our power to ensure the project goes ahead.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Other Ways You Can Help</p>
<p>Even if you can't contribute to the campaign right now, if you want to be involved in any way - audition, volunteer as crew, front-of-house or support team - we would love to hear from you.</p>

Most of our Perks include tickets to the show, starting at $24. Whether you think you'll use them yourself or pass them on to friends (for instance, if you're cast in the show!) investing in pre-purchasing tickets through the perk helps to ensure the project has enough support to go ahead. 
Some perks (starting at $48) include VIP tickets - here and now is the only way to get your hands on VIP passes! VIPs get priority seating meaning not only do they get the best seats in the house, but they are allowed into the theatre 30mins before curtain, when last minute rehearsals may still be going on!
For those who want to be even more involved, check out the higher level perks that include joining us for the announcement dinner, sitting in on rehearsals or even being touted as the Producer!
Q: What if I want to audition or volunteer to work on the project? Why would I select a perk that includes tickets I might not be able to use?   A: The perks are all fully transferable - if you select a perk with tickets or special access and then you are cast in the show, you can pass those tickets on to family or friends to use. Remember, your contribution is funding the project in the first place, and if we don't reach our goal it may not go ahead!
 
What Your Contribution Means To Us
By helping to fund this project, you become part of our local theatre community. We hope that an annual event like this can become a great networking opportunity for the many growing and flourishing companies in the greater Brisbane area.
And... the more money we raise before we start, then the more we can raise on the night for our charitable causes! Everyone who attends will be able to nominate where project profits are donated by 'donating' their ticket stub to either of our selected charitable causes. 
 
What If We Don't Make It???
If the campaign doesn't reach the goal, then we thank you for your generous contributions and put them toward covering as many of the costs as we can.
We recognise that some things may not go to plan, even so, we will do everything within (and slightly beyond!) our power to ensure the project goes ahead.
 
Other Ways You Can Help
Even if you can't contribute to the campaign right now, if you want to be involved in any way - audition, volunteer as crew, front-of-house or support team - we would love to hear from you.

<p>Romantika is a theatre, performance, and visual arts company based in London. We aim to create unique, visually striking and international performance work that reflects our current time.</p> <p>We currently have two productions: <i>The Crossing Place</i> and <i>What Lies Beneath.</i> The next step for Romantika involves the Edinburgh fringe festival, as well as a number of other domestic and international fringe festivals throughout Europe. Our destinations include:  </p>
<p>The Space, London from the 6th to the 10th of June<br/>Théâtre de Ménilmontant, Paris at the <i>Dreams Before Dawn Festival</i><br/>Upperchurch Summerhall at the <i>Edinburgh Fringe Festival</i><br/>The Monkey house at Zoo venues at the <i>Edinburgh Fringe Festival</i><br/>We also hope to visit Birmingham, Manchester and the countries involved with the <i>Nordic Fringe Festival</i> </p>
<p>This step requires a lot time and money. Your support would help us to take both shows to as many people as possible and further the company at a crucial stage in our development!</p>
<p>More info about the shows:</p>
<p><strong>The Crossing Place</strong></p>
<p><i>""Three strangers meet in the middle of nowhere, in a Crossing Place far from the communications network of civilisation. In their meeting, seemingly with nothing in common, their only means of communication slowly but surely begins to break down until nothing is left""</i></p>
<p>Through violent physical theatre, the spoken poetry of Tranströmer and the music of Franz Schubert, the piece explores what it is to be alone and scared in a world that leaves us wanting. The Crossing Place stages Tranströmer's writing in a way we believe hasn’t been done before. We’re excited to take the piece to as many people as possible!</p>
<p>The piece was first devised by Romantika in Tallinn, Estonia. It has since been performed at Rose Bruford College in London and the Västmanlands Teater in Sweden.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What Lies Beneath</strong></p>
<p><i>“She’s gone, leaving no answers that can satisfy. He finds himself in the stillness of nature, hoping perhaps that he can make things clear. Descending into madness brought on by hypothermia, a man confronts memories of friends and family in a series of non-linear and increasingly surreal flashbacks.""</i><br/><br/>In Romantika's latest production, the company takes the audience on a surreal and humorous journey, exploring men's reluctance to express their emotions, with specific focus on grief in western society. Juxtaposing comedy with tragedy, and realism with surrealism, the production involves elements of visual and physical theatre, live Scandinavian folk music, and a set and lighting design inspired by the Northern Lapland landscapes.</p>

   The Impact The project leading up to this public performance spans more than 5 years. In supporting this public performance you are making the work more accessible (by making the tickets PWYC) and helping realize a cohesive design that will support the work. This project has a significant role in creating and strengthening intergenerational community ties, including our partnership with RECAA. Support for the public performance will support RECAA's involvement in the public performance. R/E aims to offer possibilities for transformation in understanding of others and otherness in a range of community contexts.

<div><br/></div>
<div>We need 16,000 by the end of February to cover pre-show costs including theater payment, set pieces, marketing and pr, rehearsal and photography for our videographer to use in the acts as backdrops for New York, Spain and Cuba.  </div> <p>You will get a phenomenal show that will leave you energized and dancing out of Baruch Theater!  Buying a ticket through our indiegogo will save you a $7 ticket processing fee on ticket web, and if you donate or choose the full-price premier seating option, you will be helping a student or artist see the show at an affordable rate.  </p>
<p>Ever wonder what it takes to put on a little show in NYC?  Of course, the show must go on no matter what level is reached, but check out this example of the costs of an off off Broadway show that includes production:</p>
<p><b>Example of what a minimal NYC show costs from bare minimum to creation:</b></p>
<p><b>$7000:</b>  We will have secured the THEATER and you will be escorted by Baruch's ushers to a seat in a quiet dark room for two hours.  You are free to meditate, take a nap or use your iPhone, but the reception is pretty bad.  </p>
<p><b>$12,550:</b>  We can add LIGHT, SOUND and VIDEO.  I can dj and put some vacation slides in the projector, and a stage manager can select audience volunteers to give random speeches and poetry readings.  </p>
<p><b>$19,050</b> WE HAVE GROUND PERFORMERS TO ENTERTAIN YOU - HOORAY!</p>
<p><b>$23,550</b> AERIALISTS AND RIGGERS CAN BE ADDED to create the typical variety show you see in NYC.</p>
<p><b>$34,450</b>  We can hire DIRECTOR, CHOREOGRAPHER and add SET DESIGN. We can buy INSURANCE. The performers will have direction, and a stage to interact on!  A SHOW IS BORN!!  We are no longer a bare-boned variety night.</p>
<p><b>$43,450 </b> Our photographer/videographer can take architectural photos in Spain and Cuba to add to the set design, we can pay for operating expenses like flyers, water and coffee, we can rent rehearsal space, we can do PR.  We might even be able to get an intern or two to help with marketing so I could get some sleep!</p>
<p>Everyone is accepting less than their normal rates.  Flights will be paid for mainly with donated miles.  People are sleeping on couches and doing rehearsals for little or nothing.  Musicians will be paid out of pocket for rehearsals.  This is actually a really good bargain for a NYC show of this caliber!</p>

</p><p>Here we go! </p>
<p><b>The Ask: </b>Arden Winant and Genée Coreno lead Wirehead Collective’s third official production, <i>Descendants of the Chalice. </i>This is a devised and feminist performance inspired by Judy Chicago’s <i>The Dinner Party. </i></p>
<p><b><i>We need your help to raise $6,000 dollars to: cover the rehearsal rental costs and production expenses and pay our performers </i></b></p>
<p><b><i>What is DOTC anyway? </i></b><i>Descendants of the Chalice</i> uses <i>The Dinner Party by Judy Chicago</i>, Heritage Panels, and Heritage Floor as the initial source material to generate movement, text, rituals, and media content about these 39 powerful women and their potent legacy. Our all female ensemble and artistic team will devise a massive-millennial-ceremony to celebrate the accomplishments and herstories we’ve inherited from the women. </p>
<p>We have selected 9 out of Judy’s original 39 for Descendants of the Chalice. These women include Kali, Hateshepsut,Theodora, Boadecia, Petronilla de Meath, Elizabeth R, Sacajawea, Mary Wollstonecraft,and Sojourner Truth. Never fear! The remaining thirty women will be represented and influence the piece!  </p>
<p><b>Workshop Details: </b>The initial 12-day development workshop of DOTC will take place from January 18-29, 2016 in New York City.  At the culmination of this development workshop we will hold an early process showing. Not only will DOTC undergo an intense process of research, experimentation, and creation (devising) over the twelve days but, all of our designers will be in the room with us  sketching, constructing, building, scoring, and testing out their initial artistic impulses with the ensemble.</p>
<p><b>Project Goals: </b>Our goal is to use <i>Descendants of the Chalice</i> to educate our audience. They will leave the theater with the ability to tell the story of each woman. It will use the past to explore and draw comparisons to our experience as women in 2015/2016 (aka NOW). Dialoguing the past and present in this way, we will illuminate the pervasive institutional and political oppression we see and feel today. The Dinner Party represents women from different cultural and racial backgrounds and we are committed to representing each woman accordingly.</p>
<p><b>What is Wirehead Collective? </b>Wirehead Collective is an ensemble of lawless and unapologetic feminist-artists who implement performance, installation and media interventions defined by in-yer-face aesthetics &amp; disruptive techniques to instigate social evolution and reform. Learn more about us here: <a href=""http://www.wireheadcollective.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.wireheadcollective.org/</a></p>
<p>So, here we are, raising awareness, raising women, raising kane, <i>and most importantly raising money to cover the costs of this ambitious workshop! </i><span><b>Help us!

We have selected 9 out of Judy’s original 39 for Descendants of the Chalice. These women include Kali, Hateshepsut,Theodora, Boadecia, Petronilla de Meath, Elizabeth R, Sacajawea, Mary Wollstonecraft,and Sojourner Truth. Never fear! The remaining thirty women will be represented and influence the piece!  
Workshop Details: The initial 12-day development workshop of DOTC will take place from January 18-29, 2016 in New York City.  At the culmination of this development workshop we will hold an early process showing. Not only will DOTC undergo an intense process of research, experimentation, and creation (devising) over the twelve days but, all of our designers will be in the room with us  sketching, constructing, building, scoring, and testing out their initial artistic impulses with the ensemble.
Project Goals: Our goal is to use Descendants of the Chalice to educate our audience. They will leave the theater with the ability to tell the story of each woman. It will use the past to explore and draw comparisons to our experience as women in 2015/2016 (aka NOW). Dialoguing the past and present in this way, we will illuminate the pervasive institutional and political oppression we see and feel today. The Dinner Party represents women from different cultural and racial backgrounds and we are committed to representing each woman accordingly.

<p>My passion for theatre arose at an early age- as a child, I foresaw a bright future as a famous actor, but as I continued to grow, my interests developed beyond being on the stage and I explored other offstage roles, such as stage management, prop and costume design, writing, and directing.  It was in directing that I discovered my truest passion.  I love getting my hands dirty in the art of storytelling, bringing together all of the elements of a production to make an impact on our audience and, ultimately, our community.  </p>
<p>Before I lose your attention, I want to express why this campaign is so important.  There's already a lot of theater going on in Dallas; perhaps you're wondering if we really need ""yet another"" show to go see produced by ""yet another"" theatre company.  The short answer is YES.  Proper Hijinx isn't putting on ""yet another"" production of Noises Off- we're focusing on compelling, risky works that pertain to issues we currently face in modern day society.  We're looking to make a true impact to our community through our work, producing shows that will entertain our audience while simultaneously getting them to talk about things that matter.</p>
<p>But to do so, we need some help.  We're still getting off the ground and right now funding is coming from little ol' me.  I happily throw every cent I earn into Proper Hijinx and our production of The Dead Guy by Eric Coble, but I'm asking for help so I can really make this production be all that it can.  There's a lot of technology needed for this show, a lot of set pieces, and a hell of a lot of costumes- and Disneyland prostitutes are not cheap you guys!  The money you donate to this production won't just be helping us put on a show, you'll be helping us exist.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>We're looking to raise at least $2500 to put towards our first production of our first full season.  This money won't pay for all of our production costs that are tied into the show (this show will cost us about $8000 total), but it will help alleviate the financial burden.  So!  What will your donation be going towards?</p>
<p>-Costumes, set pieces, and props.  We've got 12 characters to clothe and about as many locations to create in our set.  And props?  Don't even get me started.  There's props for days.  Video games, dining ware, basketballs, blood...you name it, we have to have it.</p>
<p>-Paying the cast and production team.  Now, as a theatrician, I firmly believe in paying those involved.  I don't take a paycheck out the productions I produce because it's a labor of love- but I want my designers, actors, and stage hands to get paid for their time and energy. For many, theatre isn't just a hobby, it's a job.  And when you put in work, you should get a paycheck.  I will never ask my production team to volunteer their time because I recognize the value of their work.</p>
<p>-Publicity.  In order to get people to come see our finished product that you're generously helping us to create, we've got to spend some on photos. posters, and web design.  We need to be able to print programs to talk about our awesome production team of designers and actors and promote the rest of our season!  And believe it or not, paper and printing gets mega expensive real quick.  By putting down a little of the green paper, you'll be helping us paper the city to promote Dead Guy!</p>
<p>Now I bet you're wondering what you'll get out of it for throwing down some generosity and giving us the bucks to make this happen.  The more you donate, the better the perks become with some examples being: </p>
<p>-Have your name listed in the program as a donor</p>
<p>-Free tickets to The Dead Guy peformance of your choice</p>
<p>-Proper Hijinx Swag: water bottles, t-shirts, we even have flasks, yo. </p>
<p>So what happens if we don't reach our entire goal?  The money will still go into the production, but we'll have to beg, borrow, and steal our way into affording what isn't covered. And if we reach beyond our goal?  Then we're going to be bringing an awesome production of The Dead Guy to the DFW area and have some money to donate to our next productions in 2016- we've got two more shows to produce after this one, and those will cost money too.  </p> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>The Dead Guy by Eric Coble is a dark comedy that reflects on our country's addiction to thrilling, twisted reality television.  And it places the following question front and center: what is the value of a human life?</p>
<p>In a year when we have had more mass shootings than days, it seems to be a pretty valid question to ask.  We see people fighting for their religion, fighting for their beliefs, and quite likely fighting just to fight.  Violence begets violence and everyday it seems we are losing another life to it.  So what value do these human lives have?  Can one life make a difference?  And will our community stand idly by and allow someone to die?  The Dead Guy is a more timely piece to do now than ever, because it's not just a satire on reality television, but a reflection on our current state of humanity.</p>
<p>We at Proper Hijinx want to create a conversation on the value of human life through a compelling production of The Dead Guy, and would love your help to make our vision come to fruition.</p>

<h3>OUBLIETTE</h3>
<p><i>I was born for something more.</i></p>
<p>The five children of the noble king know the end of the war is imminent. The snow has begun to settle on the conspirators who sought to depose their family. They can hear singing from the city nearby. Yet they still hide in their palace, awaiting word of an armistice.</p>
<p>Among them is Oubliette.</p>
<p>The king’s eldest daughter, she is to be married. An elaborate affair in a cathedral tall, to be witnessed by the eyes of the kingdom. As they watch, they will forget the shadows of war. They will feel no hunger, remember no pain.</p>
<p>But just how easy is it to forget?</p>
<h3>About Powder &amp; Ink</h3>
<p>Powder &amp; Ink are a new theatre company founded by Arts University Bournemouth graduate Chloe Hatherley. Her passion for the artistry of the past inspires her to write original works that seek to invigorate the dedication to aesthetic beauty that the French nobility possessed in the 17th and 18th centuries. Beauty of language, emotion, society life, fashion, architecture and music.</p>
<p>But what is past without a future? Powder &amp; Ink seek to fuse their historical aspirations with modern ideals and themes, of diversity, technology, revolution and empowerment, to create reflective and resonant work. And they aim to truly discover- is it possible to extract beauty from an often-ugly history?</p>

<h3>About the Writer/Director</h3>
<p>Chloe Hatherley trained at the Arts University Bournemouth, graduating with a First-Class degree in Acting in 2017. She was the recipient of the Paul Elliot Prize for Acting. She loves working with heightened text, particularly Shakespeare, and her work is always created with the dramatic flair so often found in classical theatre in mind. Last year, she wrote, choreographed and composed the music for a short piece entitled 'Nymphea', a faerie tale in verse that explored what a female dominated performance art, such as the geisha in Japan, would have been like had one developed in Britain in the 19th century.</p>

<p>In the future, she seeks to not only act, write, direct and produce theatre, but also transfer those skills into filmmaking.</p>

</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>The theatre fees have already been paid, funded by the director's monetary prize that she received upon graduating from university.</p>
<p>However, the Camden Fringe Festival requires a £99 registration fee to be included in their marketing, and this needs to be raised!</p>
<h3>Actors!</h3>
<p>Our primary cost is actors! The play requires a cast of five, four of whom are yet to be sourced. Your donations will cover their travel expenses, and hopefully we can raise enough to also give them a flat fee payment for their time! This is a profit share venture, but a set fee would be an excellent bonus for any young actor!</p>
<h3>Production Design!</h3>
<p>Our secondary cost is the production design! We will need to source costumes, props and furniture, both purchasing and hiring, and so these costs need to be covered. This is a period piece, and we would love to make it as visually exciting and representative as possible!</p>
<h3>Industry Invites, Marketing and Licencing!</h3>
<p>This is a showcase opportunity for young unrepresented actors, so we would like to put aside some of the money to purchase tickets for a few select industry professionals, who may help advance our careers.</p>
<p>Marketing and printing will require some funding- flyers and posters need to be distributed in order for us to have the largest audience we can get!</p>
<p>We may require a music licence and so we have budgeted this in. If this is not the case, any money raised for this will be split between actor's fees and production design fees.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>Hopefully, we've put together a wonderful selection of perks for you if you donate! Each tier is named after a character in the piece, or a character mentioned in the piece!</p>
<p>The perks across the various tiers are:</p>

<li>A social media shout out!</li>
<li>Your name written on 'The Constitution' which is a vital prop within the piece</li>
<li>A special acknowledgement in our programme</li>
<li>A weekly video update emailed to you</li>
<li>A limited edition poster signed by the cast</li>
<li>A copy of the play signed by the cast</li>

<li>An invitation to an exclusive after show drinks reception</li>
<li>2 tickets for you and a friend to attend the show</li>
<li>Credit as a producer of the show</li>
</ul>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The theatre has already been booked for five performances and the contract signed, so there is very little risk of the project falling through.</p>
<p>This is our debut production, which in itself is a challenge, but we are confident that we can pull it off. We have a wonderful network of support to help us through!</p>

WatersCostume Designer: Alexandra Fokine Short SummaryHello, my name is Jillian Stevens and I am a born and raised New Yorker, writer, actor, certified 500-hr RYT, wellness advocate, a dreamer and a believer. I am endlessly inspired by those who let their inner light guide them; those who listen to the tiny voice inside- even when it can barely be described as a whisper- and let it linger; and those who stand up and celebrate what their hearts beat for; putting their passions before their hesitations!-As some of you may or may not know, I have created an Indiegogo campaign because I seek to raise funds to stage an original Full-Length play I have written, entitled: The Ones Upstairs, to be performed as a part of Theater for the New City's 'Dream up Festival 2018!' this August (Artistic Director, Crystal Field)!  -Because I am a fierce advocate of paying my actors and crew for their supreme work, it is important that I strive to raise the money they so deserve!  That is where your help comes in:-During a time of much political unrest, it is my objective to allow the audience to share a communal sigh of relief, embarking on a brief departure into the world of Theatre. Because it is my highest goal to leave a smile and a feeling of joy wherever I may go in this life, I wish to stage this piece of work and bring this vision to life! What We Need & What You GetI seek to raise a flexible goal of $4,000. All money raised will go toward the cost of the set, costumes,  and actor/crew stipend.Every penny helps in the funding of this production and is greatly appreciated. I am immensely thankful to those involved with the production and to those who wish to make any donation,  large,  or small!*If you donate $15 or more, you will receive a personalized & handwritten 'Thank You' letter sent to your home address!**Since this is a flexible goal,  if we do not meet our $4,000 goal,  that is okay!

<p>'What Exists Here.' celebrates supportive, calming and joyful movement performed by 7 female bodies. It is an hourlong work to be shared between the performers and audiences at The Collective Space from November 15-18th, 2018 in order to highlight positive ways to live independently while sharing space and energy with others. It displays pride and acceptance for oneself and one's surroundings and it feels good to perform or witness. Rehearsals continue until November 2018 at Broadway Arts Centre and are enriched by the proximity to the West Toronto Railpath. The performance will take place in a constructed environment referencing a safe, comfortable oasis, somewhere I would consider ideal for living.</p>

<p><strong>H1TM4N Inc</strong> is our most ambitious production yet. Using our film and theatre background, we’re creating a stage-play-TV-Pilot. A live show that is a complete story for the audience, yet also a precursor to a greater world and many more stories. What better way to prove a concept than put it in front of a live audience?</p>
<p>Yes, like our assassins, we too are adjusting to the new world of work, by innovating new ways to put on stage shows and pitch TV &amp; Film projects!</p>
<h3><strong>We need you!</strong></h3>

<p>We have always strived for fair pay for our team. They give so much of their time, energy and spirit, in return the least we can do is pay a decent wage - unfortunately this is one of the greatest challenges, but hopefully with your help we can get closer to this, most important goal!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We need your help to realise this project and your involvement to break the mould in this big budget 'Netflix’ and ‘West-End/Broadway’ dominated world.</p>
<p>Our themes are bold, mainstream and crowd pleasing, yet guerrilla in style and innovation. Crowdfunding was always a good fit for us as we’ve been unofficially doing it for years within our network of friends, family and clients. (See our Theatre Angels video below)</p>

<p><strong>Plus! Making theatre affordable is very important to us, so your pledge helps us keep the ticket prices down!</strong></p>

Hitman Inc, though a dark comedy, looks at the terraforming world of work; the gig economy and zero hour contracts. Our stories reflect our experiences and how running a small business is murder!</p>
<p>The further impact of Hitman Inc., is it's potential on the small screen.

<h3>The Risks &amp; Rewards</h3>
<p>What happens if we don’t get the funds? Well, the show must go on!

<p>For the past 2 years we've been developing a theatre project, 'Possession / al Ghiwaya'. It explores what it means to go and<strong> live your life in the desert, in total silence and isolation.</strong> We are exploring what it means to devote yourself to a <strong>spiritual cause</strong>. </p>
<p>Collaborations between UK and Egyptian theatre artists are rare. <strong>We are making our project in Egypt</strong> because it is based on an Egyptian social and religious movement 1700 years ago, when people started fleeing to the desert to live isolated lives, in order to escape persecution from the Roman Empire. Finding many parallels in the contemporary world, we are committed to <strong>bringing this story to life and sharing it with audiences</strong>. </p>
<p>Our work has been recognised and we have been invited to perform at <strong>Downtown Cairo International Arts Festival (D-Caf) in 2018.</strong> Your contribution would help us complete and present the show, and <strong>bring our work back from the desert </strong>to share with public audiences. </p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>To date, our rehearsals  have been supported by the <strong>British Council Egypt, Egyptian theatre company 'el Warsha', Sihel Island Culture Centre, and New Hermopolis. </strong>But to complete our show and present it publicly, <strong>we need your help</strong>.</p>
<p>We are looking to raise <strong>£7000</strong>. This will go towards payment of creatives, paying for a small amount of physical props on stage, accommodation, and towards travel so that we can work together. </p>
<p><strong>By contributing, you get to make an entire theatre production happen, and bring experiences from the hypnotic Egyptian desert to the public stage.</strong></p>
<p>While we appreciate that the production will premiere in Egypt, we also really want to bring our story to international audiences, both in Europe and the Middle East. By premiering in a Cairo international theatre festival we have a chance to reach these audiences... including you. </p>
<p>So... while we cannot immediately offer access to the show (if you are supporting from outside of Egypt), we intend to do so in the future.  <strong>We will keep donors updated with the show's progress, send images from rehearsal, sound bytes, videos of performance and more.</strong> Should the show tour to the donor's country, all donors offering over £100 will be offered a free ticket.  </p>
<p>We appreciate that our offer to donors (perks, etc.) might not be the best in the world. What we can offer is the satisfaction of making a fascinating work of desert theatre and an exciting exploration of spirituality come to life. <strong>Without your help it wouldn't be possible. </strong></p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Why does our project matter and <strong>what are we trying to do?</strong> We feel that spirituality and religion is a major cause of conflict and misunderstanding in today's world - especially around divisions between Islam and Christianity. <strong>By making a project that analyses and explores diverse spiritual experiences, we aim to create new dialogues that might develop greater compassion and understanding for Otherness.  </strong></p>
<p>The 3 Egyptians in our project all perform with <strong>el Warsha,  an internationally-renowned Egyptian theatre company </strong>that has presented all over the world.  The two Englishmen in our company create and perform theatre both in the UK and in Europe. <strong>Together we bring a wealth of song, music and theatre experience to create a fascinating and compelling show in both Arabic and English language. </strong></p>
<p>We are <strong>a new ensemble of young artists</strong>, who enjoy the challenge of making engaging, <strong>exciting intercultural work</strong>. We work together because we have a passion for making innovative new theatre that excites people. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Challenges</h3>
<p> </p>

Hi,
We are a group of 5 artists from Egypt (Zizo, Bassem, Mohamed) and England (Tom, Charlie).
For the past 2 years we've been developing a theatre project, 'Possession / al Ghiwaya'. It explores what it means to go and live your life in the desert, in total silence and isolation. We are exploring what it means to devote yourself to a spiritual cause. 
Collaborations between UK and Egyptian theatre artists are rare. We are making our project in Egypt because it is based on an Egyptian social and religious movement 1700 years ago, when people started fleeing to the desert to live isolated lives, in order to escape persecution from the Roman Empire. Finding many parallels in the contemporary world, we are committed to bringing this story to life and sharing it with audiences. 
Our work has been recognised and we have been invited to perform at Downtown Cairo International Arts Festival (D-Caf) in 2018. Your contribution would help us complete and present the show, and bring our work back from the desert to share with public audiences. 

 
What We Need
 
To date, our rehearsals  have been supported by the British Council Egypt, Egyptian theatre company 'el Warsha', Sihel Island Culture Centre, and New Hermopolis. But to complete our show and present it publicly, we need your help.
We are looking to raise £7000. This will go towards payment of creatives, paying for a small amount of physical props on stage, accommodation, and towards travel so that we can work together. 
By contributing, you get to make an entire theatre production happen, and bring experiences from the hypnotic Egyptian desert to the public stage.
While we appreciate that the production will premiere in Egypt, we also really want to bring our story to international audiences, both in Europe and the Middle East. By premiering in a Cairo international theatre festival we have a chance to reach these audiences... including you. 
So... while we cannot immediately offer access to the show (if you are supporting from outside of Egypt), we intend to do so in the future.  We will keep donors updated with the show's progress, send images from rehearsal, sound bytes, videos of performance and more. Should the show tour to the donor's country, all donors offering over £100 will be offered a free ticket.  
We appreciate that our offer to donors (perks, etc.) might not be the best in the world. What we can offer is the satisfaction of making a fascinating work of desert theatre and an exciting exploration of spirituality come to life. Without your help it wouldn't be possible. 
 

The Impact
 
Why does our project matter and what are we trying to do? We feel that spirituality and religion is a major cause of conflict and misunderstanding in today's world - especially around divisions between Islam and Christianity. By making a project that analyses and explores diverse spiritual experiences, we aim to create new dialogues that might develop greater compassion and understanding for Otherness.  
The 3 Egyptians in our project all perform with el Warsha,  an internationally-renowned Egyptian theatre company that has presented all over the world.  The two Englishmen in our company create and perform theatre both in the UK and in Europe. Together we bring a wealth of song, music and theatre experience to create a fascinating and compelling show in both Arabic and English language. 
We are a new ensemble of young artists, who enjoy the challenge of making engaging, exciting intercultural work. We work together because we have a passion for making innovative new theatre that excites people. 
 

Challenges
 
On the way to making our project happen over these last 2 years, we have faced many obstacles including the desert heat, a challenging financial climate, the challenge of staying together as an cross-border company. 
We're sure we'll encounter more challenges, but we are so determined to get the show on and make this happen. Even if we don't quite make our funding target, we are determined to make it happen.

<h3>We are Bez Arts Hub!</h3>
<p>I'm Sandy Rosen and I am the creative director of Bez Arts Hub in Langley, BC. After 16 years as the owner and director of Dance Barn Studio I've come to love and appreciate the community of Langley, but it has been an enormous concern that there is a lack of live performance venues in our city.</p>
<p>With our work in the arts - our team have been involved extensively in music, dance, photography, media and graphic design - we decided that we needed to go ahead and develop a performance space that could house music concerts, theatre performances, indie film premiers, dance productions and art showings. We have begun the transformation of a strategic commercial space, right in the heart of the Langley retail district. We have reworked the facility into a blackbox theatre, initially installing sprung floors and opening up the room to be an adaptable space for a myriad of diverse arts functions. Our next steps have been to outfit the space with curtains, theatre lighting, a sound system, staging and seating, projection/screen and renovations that will increase our capacity.</p>
<p>In order to do this we have gratefully received a $55,000 grant from Creative BC <u>but it needs to be matched</u>. With the $55,000 that we would raise through Indiegogo (in addition to the Creative BC grant) we will be able to complete the necessary renovations and equipment that will permit us to fully launch our performance venue before the new year!</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>What it will result in is one of Langley's only venues that is solely devoted to live arts performances. And why should Langley care about the arts? Because the arts increases economic development, tourism and social interactions in the community and can even improve cognitive development in children, Yes, art matters!</p>
<p>Our Bez team are artists and mentors to artists for the last 30+ years and we have a passion to see excellence in the arts launched in our community. We have founded our own dance studio; we have taken teams of artists across Canada and around the world; we have recorded numerous albums, produced dance productions and have launched a lifetime of creative work. </p>
<p>Furthermore, we have interviewed more than 50 artists from many arts genres and most have expressed that they have difficulty finding arts spaces in which to present and perform! We'd love to help them out - wouldn't you?</p>
<h3>More than just Bez</h3>
<p>Now to keep an arts facility running, we need more than just bookings for performances and presentations, so we have been looking to other partnerships and collaborations. We are already sharing the facility with 2 long-term partners: Dance Barn Studio, which has been in operation for more than 16 years; and Mirror Dance Program (transitioning as Mirror Arts), which has been doing pre-professional arts training for 11 years. Other short-term event partnerships have begun with Long and McQuade and WeMakeStuff as well. In general, the facility will be open for community rentals whenever Bez does not have specific events booked.</p>

</div></div>","We are Bez Arts Hub!
I'm Sandy Rosen and I am the creative director of Bez Arts Hub in Langley, BC. After 16 years as the owner and director of Dance Barn Studio I've come to love and appreciate the community of Langley, but it has been an enormous concern that there is a lack of live performance venues in our city.
With our work in the arts - our team have been involved extensively in music, dance, photography, media and graphic design - we decided that we needed to go ahead and develop a performance space that could house music concerts, theatre performances, indie film premiers, dance productions and art showings. We have begun the transformation of a strategic commercial space, right in the heart of the Langley retail district. We have reworked the facility into a blackbox theatre, initially installing sprung floors and opening up the room to be an adaptable space for a myriad of diverse arts functions. Our next steps have been to outfit the space with curtains, theatre lighting, a sound system, staging and seating, projection/screen and renovations that will increase our capacity.
In order to do this we have gratefully received a $55,000 grant from Creative BC but it needs to be matched. With the $55,000 that we would raise through Indiegogo (in addition to the Creative BC grant) we will be able to complete the necessary renovations and equipment that will permit us to fully launch our performance venue before the new year!
The Impact
What it will result in is one of Langley's only venues that is solely devoted to live arts performances. And why should Langley care about the arts? Because the arts increases economic development, tourism and social interactions in the community and can even improve cognitive development in children, Yes, art matters!
Our Bez team are artists and mentors to artists for the last 30+ years and we have a passion to see excellence in the arts launched in our community. We have founded our own dance studio; we have taken teams of artists across Canada and around the world; we have recorded numerous albums, produced dance productions and have launched a lifetime of creative work. 
Furthermore, we have interviewed more than 50 artists from many arts genres and most have expressed that they have difficulty finding arts spaces in which to present and perform! We'd love to help them out - wouldn't you?
More than just Bez
Now to keep an arts facility running, we need more than just bookings for performances and presentations, so we have been looking to other partnerships and collaborations. We are already sharing the facility with 2 long-term partners: Dance Barn Studio, which has been in operation for more than 16 years; and Mirror Dance Program (transitioning as Mirror Arts), which has been doing pre-professional arts training for 11 years. Other short-term event partnerships have begun with Long and McQuade and WeMakeStuff as well. In general, the facility will be open for community rentals whenever Bez does not have specific events booked.

We are thoroughly committed to launching this venue in Langley, so we will still pour what is raised into the transformation of the Bez Arts Hub space and continue to seek out investors and donors who are interested in partnering with us so that we can keep moving forward. BUT we do want to see the funds raised so...

<h3><strong>Hi! We're the Tom Collective...</strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>and we're a new theatre company dedicated to reclaiming womxn's history by putting womxn and queer people in power on the stage, behind the scenes, on the page, and in every aspect of theatre. The founding members (<strong>Anya Kopischke, Emma Webster, </strong>and<strong> Cora Katz</strong>) have a strong history of queering historical texts and retelling historical narratives through a nuanced, modern, feminine perspective.</p>
<p>Right now we're devising our first full-length production going up at the Tank in February. This unnamed original performance will recontextualize the female characters of Greek Tragedy through our most modern form of melodrama: reality television. We're interested in how both Greek Tragedy and reality television have defined ""strong womxn"" and ""hysterical womxn"" both onstage and in modern society. Our goal is to reclaim these male-written divas of Greek Tragedy and find their stories' relevance through our generation’s humor and style.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>We just want to PAY some WOMXN...</h3>
<p><strong>We're raising $6000 so</strong><strong> we can PAY EV</strong><strong>ERY SINGLE WOMXN WORKING ON THIS PROJECT.</strong></p>
<p>We're funding our other production costs by other means, but we're coming to YOU to support our effort to pay 12 queer and female-identifying artists $500 each for the experience and talent they are bringing to this amazing project. It's so rare to see womxn get paid what they deserve in the arts, and that's why it's our priority to distribute power AND pay equitably.</p>
<p><u>And it's really quite the team! Not only are we diverse in our experience, but we come from a variety of artistic backgrounds:</u></p>
<p>Our incredible cast (<strong>Salome Dewell</strong>, <strong>Nadia Diamond</strong> , <strong>Cora Katz</strong>, <strong>Anya Kopischke</strong> , and <strong>Anjali</strong><strong> Sundaram</strong>) <span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>are not only actors but comedians, musicians, and novelists: all industries where we believe </span>the representation<span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'> of womxn and queer folk is vital. We are excited to have all these voices make their mark in the rehearsal room, not only as </span>performers,<span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'> but as writers and creators. </span></p>
<p>We value intimate collaboration with designers at every point in the devising process, so we are integrating our sound designer (<strong>Leonie Bell</strong>,) lighting designer (<strong>Ebony Burton</strong>,) and costume designer (<strong>Karin Kopischke</strong>) and our set/props designer (<strong>Clara Harlow</strong>) into our devising rehearsals. We're so excited to work with a team so versed in professional theatre, experimental movement, and installation art. </p>
<p>Our fearless director (<strong>Emma Webster</strong>) and dramaturg (<strong>Becca Glasbrenner</strong>) have been leading us in a process that feels specifically non-patriarchal and authentic to our experience. The only male presence on our team is our amazing Stage Manager (<strong>Alex Allen</strong>).</p>
<p>These are the people you will be supporting with your donation. They are multi-talented and well-deserving of fair pay. Even if you are unable to attend this performance, your donation will ensure the production of many more (not to mention the sweet swag headed your way for doing your part in supporting female and queer artists, made by members of our team of course.)</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>We are important because...</h3>
<p>What makes this project unique is that every cog in the wheel is run by a queer and/or female-identifying individual, and we're really excited about that. We want to continue making work like this and supporting work like this, not only for the product, but for the process of making something important in a safe environment. As individuals, we have a proven track record of MAKING THESE THINGS HAPPEN. We're OBSESSED with womxn's stories and consistently found a way to create them with nothing but a powerful team. We'd like to extend that ambition to helping support more and more artists like us who are passionate about exploring a queer and female experience.</p>
<p>That, of course, won't be easy. New York City is expensive. Making theatre is expensive. We're a new company and it almost impossible to afford making our own work, much less supporting others. If we want to grow as a company and continue fostering work like this, we need the support of a community like you.</p>

<p>When I was five years old I fell in love with the theatre.  From the time I could sit in a chair and focus, I attended every play, musical, or theatrical performance that was available. I sang with my family in piano bars, and I auditioned for every play that had any part that I might possibly be cast; and when nothing materialized I created my own productions. I dressed up, sang, scripted, danced, and performed. My nickname was Tallulah! Did you do that? Did you want to?</p>
<p>I was especially touched by the story <i>The Wizard of Oz</i>. In the story, Dorothy travels down the yellow brick road in search of home. On her journey she meets the scarecrow who shares that he wants a brain. Dorothy and the scarecrow team up and as they head down the road they run into the Tin man who yearns for a heart. The Tin man joins the other two and further down the road they stumble onto a lion. The lion more than anything wants what he lacks, which is courage. Each one is searching for some part of themselves that they believe is missing. They all admit their deficiencies to each other, extend support for their individual missions, and empathize with the challenge presented. They become a team of individuals who all yearn for something, and they hold the possibility that they might somehow actually get what they want.  As they travel down the yellow brick road they encounter adversity, challenges, and obstacles. Through their determination, teamwork, and commitment to get what each of them wants, they overcome all of the challenges and persevere to the end of their journey. They are all very different in appearance; their wishes are all quite diverse; and even though their capabilities vary greatly, they band together, capitalize on their strengths, focus on their common goal of getting to Oz, and support each other in getting their individual wishes fulfilled. This model for living implanted itself into my mind at a very young age. Perhaps The Wizard of Oz means something special to you as well!</p>
<p>In 1974 I set out to create a similar reality for people through our organization. Our Inner Negotiation Workshop came into existence because my subconscious mind held the possibility of diverse individuals aligning towards a common goal, supporting each other in finding the hidden answers to their puzzles.  That was the birth of the Inner Negotiation Workshop, an environment like the yellow brick road, with highly diverse people with various objectives, who through the group process everyone eventually gets what they wanted. Whether they want to find their feelings, stand up for themselves, stop the voices in their brain, claim their truth, believe in miracles, find the courage to say, “No!” or find their way back to connecting with themselves, all things are possible! In The Workshop, Randi, the leader of the workshop, invites each participant to believe, to trust, and to overcome their challenges, then breakthrough the obstacles and find their own answers. The workshop is about making each individual dream come true. The experience is as magical as the Wizard of OZ.</p>
<p>From my earliest beginnings my love for theatre magnetized these themes to me, “Dreams can become reality!” It resonated so deeply in me that I designed my profession around that premise.</p>
<p>A group of highly diverse individuals who are ready, willing, and able to breakthrough their blind spots, coupled with safety, permission, and the belief that dreams become reality is a new recipe for a totally new genre! When personal development merges with musical theatre, it is called, <strong><i>The Worksho</i><i>p</i></strong> <strong><i>Musical, A Dress Rehearsal for Life!</i></strong></p>
<p>My sister and I hand picked our favorite segments from our Inner Negotiation Workshop; we created scenarios that we witnessed and then wove it together like a patchwork quilt. Beautiful songs started to dance in my head. Characters started to sing when I awakened in the morning. Lyrics flowed, music manifested, and soon we knew that we absolutely had to produce this magical musical.</p>
<p>My self-doubt kept me holding back, arguing for my limitations. Producing this musical has been my workshop for many years. In between our MMS Coach Trainings and our Inner Negotiation Workshops around the world, we eeked out time to recruit talented musicians and singers who would help us record the songs we composed. Each person played their part and then moved on. When we were introduced to Ken Davenport, Tony Award winning Producer, life changed!  Ken is a self-appointed dream maker. He helps non-industry outsiders build the bridge to making the dream come true. Ken saw something, and he heard something special. Then he felt something resembling hope, passion, and a new way to connect the “Dream Dots.” He became our mentor and guided us to the right director, Justin Baldridge, Musical Director, Geraldine Anello, Casting Director, Michael Cassara, General Manager, Ryan Conway, Assistant GM, Robert Schneider, Graphic artist, Steve Gilewski and most of all, he believed in us.</p>
<p>My husband, sister and I gathered our resources together to launch the “29-Hour Equity Read-through” on October 19<sup>th</sup> in New York.</p>
<p>Your participation, however small or large will support this dream becoming reality since launching an Off Broadway show is costly. If you love musical theatre, and if you have a passion for personal transformation, and if you dearly want to believe that dreams still can become reality, then dig deep in your heart and your wallet and support this new genre being born. Won’t it be wonderful saying to the world, “I supported that show becoming a hit!”  Won’t you feel proud that you opened a door for people to start believing in the seemingly impossible?</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Contributors fund ideas they can be passionate about and to people they trust. Here are some things to do in this section:</p>
<ul>
<li>We, the students of the bachelor Arts, Culture and Media from Rijksuniversiteit Groningen, come with a theatre production! It will display our interpretation of the play Duck Variations by David Mamet. Our interpretation of the absurdist play is on the current ecological crisis we are facing and sets a critical note on the relationship between men and nature. Theme’s of the Anthropocene, self-destruction, speciesism, and climate change will all pass by in this short play.</li>
<li>The Fundraiser is set up as the University has scraped any form of funding for this mandatory event, required for our bachelor. In the past years students have been able to solve this through ticket sales. During the current pandemic we would prefer to scrape this practice and make the  performance free to attend.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>To realize this project we need 500 euros.* Please help us by donating. All funders automatically get access to the play on the 20th of May regardless of whether the goal is reached!</li>
<li>Our crew consists of a talented group of third year theatre students from the University of Groningen, a top 100 global university. Our team includes students from a variety of ethnicities, and beliefs.</li>
<li>If the goal is NOT met, the funds will still enter the production but the event will not be free of charge, except to those who already backed the project, a modest entry fee would be required from the wide public.</li>
</ul>
<p>*<i>The money will mainly be spent on hiring technical equipment, which is needed to realise the online format.

<h2>Do you believe in ghosts?</h2>
<h3>Test your resolve with THE BROTHERS PARANORMAL, a new play by Prince Gomolvilas and directed by Mimi Katano.</h3>
<p>Since 2007, Pork Filled Productions has guided audiences on larger than life adventures with Chinese American con artists, Shakespearean zombies, and steampunk heroes and villains. This fall, we’re piercing the veil between the world of the living and the world of ghosts with Prince Golmovilas’ THE BROTHERS PARANORMAL.</p>
<p>Max and Visarut, two Thai American brothers, have been struggling to make ends meet with their ghost-hunting business, and when Delia comes to them asking for help with an “Asian-looking ghost,” Max smells an opportunity. What began as a cash-grab soon becomes something much more serious and everyone’s notions of reality will soon be tested.</p>
<p>PFP has loved THE BROTHERS PARANORMAL ever since we partnered with Prince for a workshop reading in 2015. We’re excited to bring this to fruition as part of the play’s rolling world premiere.</p>
<p>THE BROTHERS PARANORMAL is a deeply intersectional play, as it brings together Thai and Black characters in the American Midwest, explores questions of immigration and displacement, and tackles the topic of mental illness and grief within communities of color -- all while telling a spooky story that will delight fans of THE GRUDGE and THE HAUNTING OF HILL HOUSE.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What do we need?</h3>
<p>Our budget currently covers stipends for our actors and designers and all minimal production costs, but we would love to be able to do more. All funds raised through this IndieGogo campaign will be used directly for this production: approximately 70% will be added to the design budget, 20% will help offset rental fees, and 10% will go toward our marketing costs. Our main goal with this fundraiser is to give our designers more financial freedom to create fantastical props, sets, and costumes to give our audiences the most terrifying experience possible.</p>

<h3>Not easy. But worth it.</h3>
<p>Producing new work may not be as scary as encountering a ghost in your new home, but it certainly carries some risks with it. The PFP producers aren’t scared of the dark, though, and we’ve assembled a team of talented artists to help us out. Director Mimi Katano has a long track record of stellar work as Artistic Director of Youth Theatre Northwest. Moreover, as part of our commitment to producing thoughtful, well-informed, authentic work by artists of color, we’re working with dramaturgs and cultural consultants from Thailand, local Thai and African American communities, and Seattle’s horror fandom, who can bring their lived experience and subject matter expertise to the project. </p>
<p>THE BROTHERS PARANORMAL is in many ways a new kind of play for Pork Filled Productions: we’ve dipped our toes into the horror genre before with Qui Nguyen’s Living Dead in Denmark, but this is our first time producing a ghost play. That comes with new special effects challenges. It’s also a kind of play that Seattle audiences don’t get a chance to see much: one that centers a cross-cultural cast of characters and supernatural elements to tell a rich, emotional, humorous story. That gives us the opportunity to tell a new kind of story to a new audience -- once we reach them. </p>
<p>Part of Pork Filled Productions’ mission has always been to bring the best of genre theatre to mainstream audiences. We put a (literal) spotlight on how fantasy, horror, and sci-fi investigates big questions and deep truths. We’ve also always been dedicated to telling stories with and creating opportunities for artists of color; with this play we’re excited to be employing six talented actors of color onstage and a diverse production team of local theatre artists.</p>

<h3>About the Writer</h3>
<p>My name is Nyla Levy, I am an Actor and Playwright. I’m mixed race Pakistani and Canadian, with Muslim and Jewish heritage, born and raised in the UK. I have always gravitated towards stories that explore identity, race and culture.</p>
<p>As an actor, I’ve often played the role of ‘terrorist’s girlfriend’ or Jihadi bride, and felt that these roles were always supporting the male characters story and that the dialogue didn’t feel real. </p>
<p>In 2016, whilst playing a Jihadi Bride in a Theatre In Education play, the students interviewed our characters, and often ended up getting to a point where they understood why the girl I was playing felt she had no other options, but to join ISIS. As a result the students felt they <strong><i>‘learnt to make Muslims in my community feel more welcome”</i></strong>. Rather than demonising them, by understating the humanity of the person, we created a change in views. At that point I knew I wanted to write a play that explored this and exposed the humanity of a typically demonised character to bring light to reasons behind radicalisation.</p>
<p><strong>The Creative Team </strong></p>
<p>The subject matter of the play centres around the lives of two young British Asian girls, therefore it is important for the team to have an understanding of the experience of growing up as a young person of colour in Britain today.  As a writer and producer, I am able to ensure that more job opportunities are provided to women and people of colour, whether that is written into the script or actively seeking other creatives to work with. </p>

<p>In a world where black and white views are ever increasing, <i><strong>Does My Bomb Look Big in This?</strong></i> offers a multitude of view points within the story. </p>
<p>As an actor I was researching this topic since 2014.

<p>WHO ARE WE?</p>
<p><strong>Less Theatre</strong> is a London based puppetry company, which prides itself on creating new and original theatre. Striving towards sustainable practice and inspired by the simple pleasures of the world, all aspects of our shows are created out of locally sourced, recycled and found materials. Our puppetry breathes new life into objects often overlooked to give them shape and character.  </p>
<p>Our debut show <strong>EDEN</strong> premiered at Edinburgh Fringe festival in 2016. The show received high public and industry reviews as well being named finalist for the <strong>Edinburgh Fringe Sustainable Practice Award 2016</strong>. It was during our time up in Edinburgh that we realised the potential of the company, and the true effect our puppets can have on audience members young and old!  </p>
<p>Less Theatre was established by <strong>Jess Aquilina</strong> in 2015. Jess is a recent graduate of the Guildford School of Acting and works as freelance actor, puppeteer and workshop facilitator. As an actor she has worked with companies such as Culture Clash Theatre (Under My Thumb, Greenwich Theatre), and Flabbergast Theatre (Macbeth, wilton's Music Hall) and as a Facilitator has worked for Create Arts, NCS and WestEnd In Schools.</p>
<p>For this show Less Theatre is joined by associate artist <strong>Megan Fitzpatrick</strong>. Megan is a graduate of Mountview Academy and works as a designer, performer and producer. Megan is the co-founder of ‘The Out of Work Collective’ and ‘EMPOWhER’; credits include ‘Ordinary Days’(The Rose &amp; Crown), ‘Reagan Kelly’(Lion &amp; Unicorn), ‘Pinot!’ (New Wimbledon Theatre Studios), ‘Time for women to take the lead’ and ‘And the award goes to…!’(The Water Rats).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>WHAT’S THE PROJECT?</p>
<p>We believe that theatre can reflect the world as it is but more impressively can show the world as we want it to be and this is where our new show ""The Adventure of Ari and the Disappearing Hand” fits in!</p>
<p>Our story follows Ari, a young boy who stumbles upon an adventure when he falls into the world of an old book. It doesn’t take long for Ari to notice that the characters he meets are in trouble, they are slowly starting to fade away and when Ari learns why- he know he wants to help! </p>
<p>The story features characters based upon real women who are bold, brilliant and been breaking down barriers in their respective fields of work - each one of them imparting a little piece of their story onto Ari as they help him in his quest to save the book and characters. </p>
<p>A bright and exciting family show with puppets, queens and world leaders to admire - The Adventures of Ari and the disappearing hand will be a celebration of women who have made history and those who follow it their footsteps - pushing boundaries and making waves - history is written by women too!</p>
<p>BUT WHY?</p>
<p>To quote one of the brilliant women featured in our show <strong>“I had no concept that a woman couldn’t or shouldn’t do anything … and I simply had the view ‘Why can’t I?’</strong>” That view, these women and their stories are so inspiring. Our show not only brings these characters to a new audience but also gives a group of performers chance to play some truly fantastic women. </p>
<p><br/>WE NEED YOUR HELP!</p>
<p>At Less Theatre we believe in <strong>equal and fair</strong> pay.  Even though a large cost for producing a show has been covered with free rehearsal space,  we still need help raising funds to pay for our creative team of six people for a week, covering the cost of their expenses and offering a contribution to their pay. The Equity minimum wage for a creative for just one week is £480, and we need to fundraise for six…..</p>
<p>ANY contribution you can offer, big or small, will be welcomed. If we don’t raise to our goal we will still go ahead with the project- because this is a story that needs to be told!</p>

I am from Santa Barbara where I danced with State Street Ballet and Santa Barbara Dance Theater for the first 5 years of my professional career. In January 2017 I relocated to Los Angeles to start PDC and further my choreographic passion. </p><p>PDC has been very fortunate to have had a very busy and successful beginning of our first season having performed at several festivals as well as 2 projected out-of-state summer tours and fall performances booked. We collaborate with highly trained professional dancers who work very hard to set a high standard for this company. We are needing funding to go on tour and pay these talented dancers and to be able to keep this company growing and to be able to full fill our desire to become a non-profit and give back to inspire the next generation. The arts will only be able to continue for generations to come if we all come together to make it happen. </p><p>By contributing you will allow us to become a non-profit and be able to touch this next generation to hopefully impact them to want to move their bodies and spend less time on their phones and activate the creative parts of their brains. Your contribution will also allow those children to be able to have promising examples of hardworking, enthusiastic professional dancers who will be fully involved in our outreach program. By supporting PDC you will not only allow children within Los Angeles to be inspired by dance but also within the communities of the cities we tour to.</p><h3>What we need </h3><p>To get us on tour, have 10 performances+, pay dancers a small performance stipend, host our own fall performance, collaborate with a violinist, have handmade and tailored costumes will cost us $7,000 that will get us through the whole rest of this year.</p><p>If we only receive a portion of this amount, what is received first will go toward tour and fabric costs, then dancer stipends and violinist payments which may need to be minimized if needed.</p><p>It costs $1,230+ to become a California Non-Profit. </p><p><strong>The break down:</strong></p><p>Las Vegas hotel = $700</p><p>Gas on tour(Vegas and greater LA)= $250</p><p>Small dancer performance pay for the year =$4,650</p><p>Violinist =$200</p><p>Costumes= $700</p><p>Venue for fall show= $500</p><p><strong>Sub total: $7,000</strong></p><p><u><i>Company upgrades:</i></u></p><p>Dancer rehearsal rate- 10 dancers, $5/hr =$3,910 </p><p>5 hours/week/month in a big dance studio= $700/month ($35/hr)</p><p>NYC fall tour for White Wave Festival= flights/hotel for 2-3</p><p><strong>Grand total= $11,610 + NYC prices</strong></p><h3><strong><u>To give a tax deductible donation please go to the Dance Resource Center to give</u></strong></h3><h3><a href=""https://drc.nationbuilder.com/palm_dance_collective"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://drc.nationbuilder.com/palm_dance_collec...</a></h3><h3> </h3><h3>What you get!!!</h3><p>If you donate:</p><p>$25- we'll post on Instagram and Facebook a personal dance video just for you!</p><p>$50- Drink ticket to our fall show plus our pervious perks!</p><p>$100- Ticket to our show plus our previous perks!</p><p>$500- Private Dance Lesson plus all previous perks! </p><p>Find out more information on all the perks when you donate!</p><p><strong>****** By sharing that you donated either by social media or email, you'll receive recognition on our website.

PDC has been blessed with numerous performing opportunities within this first season and only continues to be getting accepted to performances and love from the community. Our track record will only continue to grow and spread through out the years. </p><p><strong>Long term goal-</strong></p><p>Your support now will help this company get on it's feet to eventually reach our long term goal. Our vision for the future is to be able to have a space where anyone from the community can walk by and watch, listen, or voice their opinion and be apart of the creative space. Most often the public only sees art in it's finished product and don't see the hours and hard work and creative process to creating a finished work. We want to have a studio space where the glass doors are always open and couches are inviting the public to come and be apart of our art from. </p><p>Another vision is to have a performance venue much like the famous Jacob's Pillow but right here on the west coast. We want to have a huge outdoor dance platform with a beautiful backdrop and benches for the audience to sit on in the grass. Performances would be free and for everyone!</p><p>We also want to be collaborating with more than just dancers. We want to bring in visual artists, designers, musicians, architects, actors, poets, set designers, etc. We want to transform the performance experience.</p><p> </p><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3><p>I, Carisa, am very ambitious, optimistic and determined. This is what has brought us this far but I can only do so much before I break. Currently, I am working at a yoga studio and catering to try to pay for dancer performance stipends and to get us by with all the festival application fees. Without your help we will not be able to continue to perform because my income can only take us so far. Our risks are that I will burn out of working so much without any support and help and we will simply only be able to perform in small local shows without any dancer pay. Even if we receive a small amount of our goal it will help us along and encourage us to keep pursuing this company and our vision. Our fall show will also act as a fundraiser which will help our process along.</p><p> It is also very challenging to look for grants and figure out how to become a non-profit. This is very exhausting and time consuming. We are hoping to have the funding provided for so that we can apply for grants to help us become the company of our vision.</p><p> </p><h3>Other ways you can help</h3><p>SHARE!!! Please share this fundraiser on all your social media sites! Please spread the word! The only way we'll be able to do this is with the help of our friends and family spreading the word! Indiegogo has great sharing tools to use, please use them and it will be easier for you to share! Be sure to follow us on Instagram @pdcla and Facebook. Check our website for regular updates on performances and blog insights. </p><p>Besides money we will gladly accept help in many other ways!

I am from Santa Barbara where I danced with State Street Ballet and Santa Barbara Dance Theater for the first 5 years of my professional career. In January 2017 I relocated to Los Angeles to start PDC and further my choreographic passion. PDC has been very fortunate to have had a very busy and successful beginning of our first season having performed at several festivals as well as 2 projected out-of-state summer tours and fall performances booked. We collaborate with highly trained professional dancers who work very hard to set a high standard for this company. We are needing funding to go on tour and pay these talented dancers and to be able to keep this company growing and to be able to full fill our desire to become a non-profit and give back to inspire the next generation. The arts will only be able to continue for generations to come if we all come together to make it happen. By contributing you will allow us to become a non-profit and be able to touch this next generation to hopefully impact them to want to move their bodies and spend less time on their phones and activate the creative parts of their brains. Your contribution will also allow those children to be able to have promising examples of hardworking, enthusiastic professional dancers who will be fully involved in our outreach program. By supporting PDC you will not only allow children within Los Angeles to be inspired by dance but also within the communities of the cities we tour to.What we need To get us on tour, have 10 performances+, pay dancers a small performance stipend, host our own fall performance, collaborate with a violinist, have handmade and tailored costumes will cost us $7,000 that will get us through the whole rest of this year.If we only receive a portion of this amount, what is received first will go toward tour and fabric costs, then dancer stipends and violinist payments which may need to be minimized if needed.It costs $1,230+ to become a California Non-Profit. The break down:Las Vegas hotel = $700Gas on tour(Vegas and greater LA)= $250Small dancer performance pay for the year =$4,650Violinist =$200Costumes= $700Venue for fall show= $500Sub total: $7,000Company upgrades:Dancer rehearsal rate- 10 dancers, $5/hr =$3,910 5 hours/week/month in a big dance studio= $700/month ($35/hr)NYC fall tour for White Wave Festival= flights/hotel for 2-3Grand total= $11,610 + NYC pricesTo give a tax deductible donation please go to the Dance Resource Center to givehttps://drc.nationbuilder.com/palm_dance_collec... What you get!!!If you donate:$25- we'll post on Instagram and Facebook a personal dance video just for you!$50- Drink ticket to our fall show plus our pervious perks!$100- Ticket to our show plus our previous perks!$500- Private Dance Lesson plus all previous perks! Find out more information on all the perks when you donate!****** By sharing that you donated either by social media or email, you'll receive recognition on our website. Don't forget to tag us or cc us in the email so we know you did!******To give a tax deductible donation please go to the Dance Resource Center to givehttps://drc.nationbuilder.com/palm_dance_collec... Your impactYour contribution will allow the arts to continue to thrive in society and effect the coming generations. PDC has been blessed with numerous performing opportunities within this first season and only continues to be getting accepted to performances and love from the community. Our track record will only continue to grow and spread through out the years. Long term goal-Your support now will help this company get on it's feet to eventually reach our long term goal. Our vision for the future is to be able to have a space where anyone from the community can walk by and watch, listen, or voice their opinion and be apart of the creative space. Most often the public only sees art in it's finished product and don't see the hours and hard work and creative process to creating a finished work. We want to have a studio space where the glass doors are always open and couches are inviting the public to come and be apart of our art from. Another vision is to have a performance venue much like the famous Jacob's Pillow but right here on the west coast. We want to have a huge outdoor dance platform with a beautiful backdrop and benches for the audience to sit on in the grass. Performances would be free and for everyone!We also want to be collaborating with more than just dancers. We want to bring in visual artists, designers, musicians, architects, actors, poets, set designers, etc. We want to transform the performance experience. Risks & ChallengesI, Carisa, am very ambitious, optimistic and determined. This is what has brought us this far but I can only do so much before I break. Currently, I am working at a yoga studio and catering to try to pay for dancer performance stipends and to get us by with all the festival application fees. Without your help we will not be able to continue to perform because my income can only take us so far. Our risks are that I will burn out of working so much without any support and help and we will simply only be able to perform in small local shows without any dancer pay. Even if we receive a small amount of our goal it will help us along and encourage us to keep pursuing this company and our vision. Our fall show will also act as a fundraiser which will help our process along. It is also very challenging to look for grants and figure out how to become a non-profit. This is very exhausting and time consuming. We are hoping to have the funding provided for so that we can apply for grants to help us become the company of our vision. Other ways you can helpSHARE!!! Please share this fundraiser on all your social media sites! Please spread the word! The only way we'll be able to do this is with the help of our friends and family spreading the word! Indiegogo has great sharing tools to use, please use them and it will be easier for you to share! Be sure to follow us on Instagram @pdcla and Facebook. Check our website for regular updates on performances and blog insights. Besides money we will gladly accept help in many other ways! We would love help in researching grants that would be applicable for us. We would gladly accept any help in writing the grants as well. Getting our outreach programs going consists of a lot of reaching out and research that we would love help with. We are about to be sewing beautiful costumes for our Vegas and fall performances and any locals with sewing experience would be very welcomed! *Photos taken by Tanne Willow Photography",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Go On By contributing to this campaign, even if you choose none of the rewards available, you will get a ticket to watch our shows, and we hope that that is enough of a gift from us to you for the time that you have spent clicking on the Facebook link, giving us your hard-earned money, coming to the venues, and partaking in a production that we've not only worked hard for, but thoroughly enjoyed creating for you. Thank you for coming this far with us, and Happy Holidays!Please help us spread the word by:Talking about us!Sharing on Facebook!https://www.facebook.com/5toMidnightInternational/Tag us on instagram #5tomidnight @5tomidnightintl!Email us at 5toMidnightintl@gmail.com for more information!

<p>This work has already received support from Dance Development Centre as a part of their DDCreative residency. This has provided the space needed for creation, rehearsals and performance and has been a massive support for the project. Although there is still a lot needed to help this come to full fruition and that’s where your generous self comes in.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Any donations you’re able to make will go towards equipment needed for the creation and showing of the work such as costumes, set, sound equipment and lighting. It will also go towards the artists in residence to help support them over the creation period as many hours will be involved during the process.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The choreographer and dancer in the show is Nicholas Jachno. Nicholas is a Canberra based Contemporary Dancer. He studied a range of dance techniques at Dance Development Centre before attending The New Zealand School of Dance, Graduating with a Diploma in Dance Performance majoring in Contemporary. In 2018, Nicholas has been a part of Malia Johnston’s, <i>Rushes</i>, for the 2018 New Zealand Arts Festival, which received four Wellington Theatre Awards. He was also a dancer and collaborator in a design film project, Kinesis, that was displayed as part of the Lux Light Festival in Wellington and received a Bronze award at the Best Design Awards 2018. Nicholas also worked for Cadi McCarthy as a dancer in Catapult Dance Choreographic Hubs premiere Season of <i>That Place in Between</i>.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Composer and Sound Engineer for the score is Maluil Aleer Deng. Maluil is Canberra based Artist, Producer &amp; Creative. He released his first EP titled DEMO in 2018 which gave us a glimpse into what this young creative powerhouse can &amp; will do in the near future. Maluil brings a unique perspective into the creation of this work and has been involved not only with the sound elements but with the visuals components as well.   </p>
<p> </p>
<p>There are bigger plans and ideas ahead for this show but to be able to create and present it in a studio setting will give it the opportunity to generate interest around it and allow a chance for feedback and discussion within the local community. If you're not able to give a donation you can still support by coming to the showing on the 24th of January.</p>

<p>This production reclaims the centrality of women’s issues as a crucial component in the revival of a nation and liberation of its people from all types of oppression and colonization.

<p>Forty years and 15 artistic dance and music productions later, the Troupe has reached a turning point and a new threshold. Having presented more than 1,500 performances in Palestine and the world, trained 1,000 children annually in underprivileged and marginalized areas and having established co-ed Debke groups in highly conservative areas, El-Funoun today prides itself in making remarkable achievements that cannot be disregarded.</p>
<p>Debke is considered one of the main components of the heritage and identity of the Palestinian people and of Greater Syria in general. The Troupe has 204 active volunteer members and a vision and ambition aimed at the liberation of its people.

<p>The new dance and music production, Ashira, has an estimated budget of US$180,000 including costs of music composition, choreography, scenography, dramaturgy, and artistic direction as well as the premier performances. Several individuals, companies and foundations have already contributed to covering these costs. The remaining deficit is US$75,000. The audience has always been an integral part of the identity and work of El Funoun, which is why the Troupe decided to target US$ 31,000 to be raised through crowd-funding.</p>
<p>The funds collected through this campaign will partially cover the costs of the music production that 10 Arab and Palestinian young musicians are currently working on. It will cover the cost of music recording, composition, arrangement, and recording.

<p>The production, Ashira, will be premiered in mid-March 2019 followed by a series of performances. These will target audiences from areas that lack the technical requirements for such performances and which are only available in Ramallah, at the Ramallah Cultural Palace in particular. Over 5,000 people will be invited and buses will be provided to transport audiences to and from Ramallah over the course of seven days. An Arab and international performance tour will follow in 2020 and 2021 in addition to other tours in Palestine.</p>

<p>Welcome back, Y'all. Allow me to reintroduce myself: My name is Roderick (Ricky) Woodruff. I was born and raised on the eastside of Detroit. I am a graduate of Southern Methodist University (SMU) with a Bachelors of Fine Arts in Acting. Prior to pandemic, I was on track to debut my four years of hard work, my baby, A Boy's Room at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. Like everyone else, I discovered that life doesn't always work out the way we want. The universe had other plans. Theatre doors were closed and the faith of A Boy's Room seemed to hang on on by a thread. I was ready to let go, but God had other plans. God showed me with a little faith, the world would began to open up to me-- keep faith and all will be well. I had no choice but to answer the call...</p>
<p><i><strong><span><u>So, we are back; theatre is back; A Boys Room is back! And this time, you WILL get the chance to see just why God has told us to KEEP FAITH. </u></span>Rejoin my revolution: the New York premier of “A Boy’s Room.”</strong></i></p>
<p>A Boy’s Room is a multimedia memory play that follows little Ricky in his bedroom, attempting to put on a one-of-a-kind performance inspired by  Beyoncé’s Formation World Tour. During his flamboyant pop performance, he is steadily interrupted by his inner demons, who constantly beg him to conform. At its core, A Boy’s Room is meant to disrupt, deconstruct, and ultimately dismantle toxic-masculinity that is generationally imposed on black boys. Through the use of a short film, creative storytelling, original music and choreography, A Boy’s Room serves as my call to action- educating the world [particularly black men] on the importance of embracing one’s whole self.</p>
<p>As a poor, black and gay man I have experienced public humiliation, doubt and self hate. I have spent most of my life in search of wholeness and self worth. More often than not, I had found myself resenting the circumstances of which I’d been placed. More so, I resented those whom I felt had placed me there. I had become insecure, to say the least. I quickly learned to wear masks to conceal the shame I felt in everyday things; my mom’s beat up 1990’s Subaru, the ebonics I grew up speaking and the Beyonce song lumped in my throat. Being a poor, black and gay boy from Detroit was a Death sentence to me. I worked hard to prove myself to my community by excelling artistically at the internationally acclaimed Mosaic Youth Theatre of Detroit, academically at Cass Technical High School and even beyond Detroit at Southern Methodist University and Dallas Theatre Center. I truly believed the only way to escape my circumstances was through assimilation. I yearned to be seen as a distinguished man, though it would amount to a complete loss of self identity. By senior year at SMU, I had realized that my acting techniques were great, but my work was lacking the brutal honesty that is required to make real art. It was lacking my truth. It was lacking the poor, black, gay boy I tried to erase. I began to question myself and my work. How could I be this revolutionary, transformative and inspirational artist who influences the next generation, while living a lie? The answer was simple: I couldn’t.</p>
<p>So, I wrote A Boy’s Room, not only to reconcile my relationship with self, but to also ensure that no little black boy ever thinks that assimilation is his only way out.</p>
<p>After realizing its potential, I workshopped and staged the first production in April of 2019. Despite the conservative culture at SMU, the production was well received. Each night, the show’s occupancy was at maximum capacity. The audience members were transcended. It was as if we had experienced a spiritual gathering together. It was here that I understood the potential for truly engaging, transforming and inspiring the world. I then teamed up with producer Kaylyn Buckley (SMU ‘17) and director Brandi Nicole Mcleain (SMU ‘19) to begin laying the ground work for both a New York and 2020 Edinburgh Fringe Festival debut. And though the 2020 productions did not happen, we preserved-- ensuring we remained ready for the NYC arts resurgence-- and was gifted a platform from a leading NYC theatre.</p>
<p>During a time when theatre seems to be revamping, it is important for us to reevaluate which stories are being told. I am tired of not seeing myself on Broadway stages. I am tired of feeling like I have no chance of ever making it. A Boy's Room is for the boys who don't feel enough. It is for the boys who conform because they do not know if they can survive being themselves. I want them to those boys to see themselves. I want them to hear a story that may be closer to theirs. It is time. We will not hide in shadows anymore. We deserve to have easy access to our stories. Due to the nature of most theatre right now, we will virtually stream the production which allows audiences to remain active by posting and tweeting--assisting us in promoting our narrative--and also ensures that the show’s targeted audience have easy access to the performance. </p>
<p>Today, I ask you to join our movement.  A Boy's Room is a lifestyle; a relationship to a truth that is greater than just a play. It is a voice for countless young black men who cannot (or refuse) to speak his truth. It is my way of protecting, engaging, inspiring and transforming the generation that succeeds me. It is a safe space where theatre meets community and vice versa. With your help, A Boy’s Room can change lives. I am asking you to join our movement and to partner with us in saving the little Black gay boy who feels inadequate and ashamed. To produce A Boy’s Room successfully, we need to raise at least $2,000. Easy, right? This money will be used for lighting and sound equipment, pay for our invaluable creatives, costumes, transportation, and other crucial production expenses.

</div></div>","Welcome back, Y'all. Allow me to reintroduce myself: My name is Roderick (Ricky) Woodruff. I was born and raised on the eastside of Detroit. I am a graduate of Southern Methodist University (SMU) with a Bachelors of Fine Arts in Acting. Prior to pandemic, I was on track to debut my four years of hard work, my baby, A Boy's Room at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. Like everyone else, I discovered that life doesn't always work out the way we want. The universe had other plans. Theatre doors were closed and the faith of A Boy's Room seemed to hang on on by a thread. I was ready to let go, but God had other plans. God showed me with a little faith, the world would began to open up to me-- keep faith and all will be well. I had no choice but to answer the call...
So, we are back; theatre is back; A Boys Room is back! And this time, you WILL get the chance to see just why God has told us to KEEP FAITH. Rejoin my revolution: the New York premier of “A Boy’s Room.”
A Boy’s Room is a multimedia memory play that follows little Ricky in his bedroom, attempting to put on a one-of-a-kind performance inspired by  Beyoncé’s Formation World Tour. During his flamboyant pop performance, he is steadily interrupted by his inner demons, who constantly beg him to conform. At its core, A Boy’s Room is meant to disrupt, deconstruct, and ultimately dismantle toxic-masculinity that is generationally imposed on black boys. Through the use of a short film, creative storytelling, original music and choreography, A Boy’s Room serves as my call to action- educating the world [particularly black men] on the importance of embracing one’s whole self.
As a poor, black and gay man I have experienced public humiliation, doubt and self hate. I have spent most of my life in search of wholeness and self worth. More often than not, I had found myself resenting the circumstances of which I’d been placed. More so, I resented those whom I felt had placed me there. I had become insecure, to say the least. I quickly learned to wear masks to conceal the shame I felt in everyday things; my mom’s beat up 1990’s Subaru, the ebonics I grew up speaking and the Beyonce song lumped in my throat. Being a poor, black and gay boy from Detroit was a Death sentence to me. I worked hard to prove myself to my community by excelling artistically at the internationally acclaimed Mosaic Youth Theatre of Detroit, academically at Cass Technical High School and even beyond Detroit at Southern Methodist University and Dallas Theatre Center. I truly believed the only way to escape my circumstances was through assimilation. I yearned to be seen as a distinguished man, though it would amount to a complete loss of self identity. By senior year at SMU, I had realized that my acting techniques were great, but my work was lacking the brutal honesty that is required to make real art. It was lacking my truth. It was lacking the poor, black, gay boy I tried to erase. I began to question myself and my work. How could I be this revolutionary, transformative and inspirational artist who influences the next generation, while living a lie? The answer was simple: I couldn’t.
So, I wrote A Boy’s Room, not only to reconcile my relationship with self, but to also ensure that no little black boy ever thinks that assimilation is his only way out.
After realizing its potential, I workshopped and staged the first production in April of 2019. Despite the conservative culture at SMU, the production was well received. Each night, the show’s occupancy was at maximum capacity. The audience members were transcended. It was as if we had experienced a spiritual gathering together. It was here that I understood the potential for truly engaging, transforming and inspiring the world. I then teamed up with producer Kaylyn Buckley (SMU ‘17) and director Brandi Nicole Mcleain (SMU ‘19) to begin laying the ground work for both a New York and 2020 Edinburgh Fringe Festival debut. And though the 2020 productions did not happen, we preserved-- ensuring we remained ready for the NYC arts resurgence-- and was gifted a platform from a leading NYC theatre.
During a time when theatre seems to be revamping, it is important for us to reevaluate which stories are being told. I am tired of not seeing myself on Broadway stages. I am tired of feeling like I have no chance of ever making it. A Boy's Room is for the boys who don't feel enough. It is for the boys who conform because they do not know if they can survive being themselves. I want them to those boys to see themselves. I want them to hear a story that may be closer to theirs. It is time. We will not hide in shadows anymore. We deserve to have easy access to our stories. Due to the nature of most theatre right now, we will virtually stream the production which allows audiences to remain active by posting and tweeting--assisting us in promoting our narrative--and also ensures that the show’s targeted audience have easy access to the performance. 
Today, I ask you to join our movement.  A Boy's Room is a lifestyle; a relationship to a truth that is greater than just a play. It is a voice for countless young black men who cannot (or refuse) to speak his truth. It is my way of protecting, engaging, inspiring and transforming the generation that succeeds me. It is a safe space where theatre meets community and vice versa. With your help, A Boy’s Room can change lives. I am asking you to join our movement and to partner with us in saving the little Black gay boy who feels inadequate and ashamed. To produce A Boy’s Room successfully, we need to raise at least $2,000. Easy, right? This money will be used for lighting and sound equipment, pay for our invaluable creatives, costumes, transportation, and other crucial production expenses.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello. I'm Lenny Gatto<i> (</i><i>Executive Producer, Playwright &amp; Composer), </i> born and raised in New Jersey. I began studying music at the age of 12 and subsequently served in the U.S. Navy (Vietnam Veteran) for 20 years. I lived in Italy many and observed many life situations which I now bring to life in this story.  Never has there been an original music about the lives and customs of ordinary Italians and I felt it was about time one was presented that has absolutely nothing to do with organized crime or wiseguys. I am passionate about this project because it is completely based on actual events. The music is original and many of the love ballads were written as far back as 1972. The show is a love story to be sure that is fit for the entire family.</p>
<p>Anyone with least one drop of Italian blood (or even if not), should see this show! It will make you smile, laugh, shed a tear or two, and even spark a distant or present memory. By the way, I love shows with happy endings. The show is respectfully dedicated to my late wife, Rosa, and my fantastic lyricist and best friend, the late Tom Jansing.</p>
<p>I am extremely proud that ""They Call it Gravy; <u><i><strong>WE</strong></i></u> Call It SAUCE! is a 2017 Perry Award Nominee for the category of Outstanding Original Musical.</p>
<p>Today, Community Theater. Tomorrow, Broadway!</p>
<p>Since the show is original, we need sets, props and I want to be able to pay my extremely talented actors who will travel from NYC to New Jersey for numerous rehearsals and performances...and of course, I have to rent the venue and services.</p>
<p>I offer the following rewards for contributors: Shoutouts on social media, tee shirts, coffee mugs, Soundtrack CD.</p>
<p>Contributors can see more information on the Music Jar Productions Facebook Page.</p>
<p>I ask that you spread the word and please use Indiegogo share tools!</p>
<p>Grazie mille!</p>

<h3>Reality:Check Productions</h3>
<p>Reality:Check Productions are committed within their programme to rediscovering and reimaging contemporary classics for a new audience. We aim to reinterpret these plays through the physicality of the characters and to give the audience a visceral experience of the plays.</p>
<p>Reality:Check are a young company, with both founderers in their early 20’s. We  believe that this is an important factor as we really believe in young people using their own unique voice. We aim to give other young artist the chance to do this where they may not have the means for example our upcoming collaboration with Colin Barrett and our new  partnership with The Dolemen Theatre to present nights of New Writing.</p>
<p>We treat all of our projects, workshops and rehearsal room as a safe, creative, devising ensemble, where everyone involves is of equal standing and has the chacne to use their own unique voice as a part of a bigger picture.</p>
<p>We also have the craic</p>
<h2>Colin Barrett</h2>
<p>Born in 1982, Barrett grew up in County Mayo and worked for a mobile phone company in Dublin before returning to college to study creative writing. His stories began appearing in the Irish literary journal The Stinging Fly in 2009, with the magazine bringing out a collection four years later as Barrett signed with Jonathan Cape in the UK and Grove in the US.</p>
<p>Young Skins, Colin Barrett’s debut work, has won the Guardian First Book Award, The Frank O’Connor International Short Story Prize, the Rooney Prize for Irish Literature and was longlisted for the Folio Prize. It has just been published in the United States to a rave review in the New York Times </p>
<p>The collection is set for the most part in the fictional town of Glanbeigh, a nowheresville hard by the “gnarled jawbone” of Ireland’s Atlantic coastline with a roundabout, an industrial estate, a five-screen Cineplex and “a century of pubs packed inside the square mile of the town’s limits”. A cast of petrol pump attendants, recovering addicts, drug dealers and bouncers weaves around this constricted world from night club to fast-foodery, from river bank to concrete picnic area, the city far enough away that it might well as be on the moon. Violence hangs in the air – violence which can be swerved, or pushed aside to offer some unexpected transcendence, but is always there, hovering like the “thickets and thickets” of midges in the evening.</p>
<h2>Where your money goes</h2>
<p>As We are a completely unfunded company, we rely on fundraising in order to produce our work. We, along with the fantastic artists we work with, give up our time for almost nothing in order to bring our artistic visions to life. That being said there are some administrative costs that we need to cover in order to make this show happen.</p>
<p>These include, paying a Graphic Designer, Lighting Designer and paying for print, rehearsal space and lots more. Ideally we want our entire team to make as much as possible for this project, as it is crucial we pay artists for their work. So the more of these admin costs we can cover early the better position we are in for our artists.</p>
<p>Reality:Check Productions pays all profit made from its shows directly to the team involved.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Anything you can give would make a HUGE difference.</p>

</div></div>","Reality:Check Productions
Reality:Check Productions are committed within their programme to rediscovering and reimaging contemporary classics for a new audience. We aim to reinterpret these plays through the physicality of the characters and to give the audience a visceral experience of the plays.
Reality:Check are a young company, with both founderers in their early 20’s. We  believe that this is an important factor as we really believe in young people using their own unique voice. We aim to give other young artist the chance to do this where they may not have the means for example our upcoming collaboration with Colin Barrett and our new  partnership with The Dolemen Theatre to present nights of New Writing.
We treat all of our projects, workshops and rehearsal room as a safe, creative, devising ensemble, where everyone involves is of equal standing and has the chacne to use their own unique voice as a part of a bigger picture.
We also have the craic
Colin Barrett
Born in 1982, Barrett grew up in County Mayo and worked for a mobile phone company in Dublin before returning to college to study creative writing. His stories began appearing in the Irish literary journal The Stinging Fly in 2009, with the magazine bringing out a collection four years later as Barrett signed with Jonathan Cape in the UK and Grove in the US.
Young Skins, Colin Barrett’s debut work, has won the Guardian First Book Award, The Frank O’Connor International Short Story Prize, the Rooney Prize for Irish Literature and was longlisted for the Folio Prize. It has just been published in the United States to a rave review in the New York Times 
The collection is set for the most part in the fictional town of Glanbeigh, a nowheresville hard by the “gnarled jawbone” of Ireland’s Atlantic coastline with a roundabout, an industrial estate, a five-screen Cineplex and “a century of pubs packed inside the square mile of the town’s limits”. A cast of petrol pump attendants, recovering addicts, drug dealers and bouncers weaves around this constricted world from night club to fast-foodery, from river bank to concrete picnic area, the city far enough away that it might well as be on the moon. Violence hangs in the air – violence which can be swerved, or pushed aside to offer some unexpected transcendence, but is always there, hovering like the “thickets and thickets” of midges in the evening.
Where your money goes
As We are a completely unfunded company, we rely on fundraising in order to produce our work. We, along with the fantastic artists we work with, give up our time for almost nothing in order to bring our artistic visions to life. That being said there are some administrative costs that we need to cover in order to make this show happen.
These include, paying a Graphic Designer, Lighting Designer and paying for print, rehearsal space and lots more. Ideally we want our entire team to make as much as possible for this project, as it is crucial we pay artists for their work. So the more of these admin costs we can cover early the better position we are in for our artists.
Reality:Check Productions pays all profit made from its shows directly to the team involved.
 
Anything you can give would make a HUGE difference.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Welcome to Ozark Living Newspaper Theatre's Art of Change campaign. OLN grew out of a collective interest among Central Arkansas artists and activists to develop a theatre company that used puppetry, mask, movement, and spoken word to generate dialogue and action about community problems, both local and global. Established as a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organization in 2017, OLN has spent its first year building partnerships with educational institutions, other arts organizations, and local charities.</p>
<p>In building toward our inaugural season of full production in 2018-2019, we have conducted workshops on nonprofit organizing, grant writing for arts and social justice, and the #MeToo movement as it impacts working artists. In the past year, OLN has used large parade puppets to raise funds for Louisiana flood relief, to make Central Arkansans aware of proposed campus concealed carry legislation, to support juvenile justice arts projects, and to raise funds for local women's shelters. Like the ""Living Newspapers"" developed under the Federal Theatre Project during the Great Depression, OLN exists to get Americans thinking and talking about the issues that affect them on an everyday basis - and to take action to bring positive change to their communities. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The Art of Change campaign focuses on three goals:</p>
<p>-Paying for rehearsal and performance venues for our Unfringed Fests in support of local charities and for our 2018-2019 season. </p>
<p>-Raising funds to pay workshop leaders and venue costs for our juvenile court theatre partnerships with Faulkner County Juvenile Court.</p>
<p>-Raising funds to partially cover production costs for our 2018-2019 season:  ""Waiting for Lefty"" by Clifford Odets, an original, devised piece based on the #MeToo movement, and ""Flex"" by Candrice Jones. </p>
<p>Contributors to the Art of Change campaign will receive the following benefits: </p>
<p>Up to $10:  One free ticket to any OLN production.</p>
<p>$25-$50 range:  Fees waived for one OLN-sponsored workshop or two tickets to any OLN production.</p>
<p>$50-$100:  Fees waived for up to two participants in an OLN-sponsored workshop or four tickets to any OLN production.</p>
<p>$100 or above: Fees waived for up to four participants in an OLN-sponsored workshop or six tickets to any OLN production. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<h3>OLN's Board and artistic collective is committed to the idea that great theatre happens in two ways:  First, through committed, talented artists engaging in passionate performance. And second, through motivating people who do not normally do theatre to use it as a tool for positive social change, to address community problems, and to engage in action for social justice. </h3>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Most new theatre companies fail within their first couple of years. OLN is no more immune to the risk of failure than any other company. Our challenge is to engage the proverbial ""little guy."" We're less interested in mega-donations than we are in small donations from a wide swath of community members who feel disenfranchised, disengaged, and discombobulated by the current political climate. Yes, OLN will apply for grants to enable its partnerships and pursue its artistic goals, but our ""bread and butter"" can and should be from small donors (yes, $10 counts), workshop participants, and audience members. We believe the work we do is exciting, necessary, and worth paying for. We believe in paying artists for their work and consider that a main goal. And we believe that the best litmus test for the vitality of a theatre of action is support from the people least able to give large donations. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>OLN would like to work with you to create stories about your community's history and challenges. If you think you ""qualify,"" organize a community meeting and invite us to make a presentation. We'll tell you how we will work with your community to engage in theatre-based problem solving. </p>

<p><strong>About the Musical:</strong></p>
<p>A college student discovers that her father is accused of rape through a viral tweet.</p>
<p>A successful accountant struggles to justify her queer relationship in a conversation with a conservative parent.</p>
<p>A new father vows to change the world for his infant daughter.</p>
<p>In ""My Father, Too"", three one-act musicals explore the nuances of father-daughter relationships in the #MeToo era.</p>
<p><b>About the Composer/Lyricist:</b></p>
<p>Celina Reynes is a composer, lyricist, and teacher based out of Oakland, CA. Her lyrical work focuses on the nuances of identity and sexuality, memory, and reputation. Her lyrics are sometimes humorous, sometimes romantic, sometimes macabre; she enjoys exploring the tension between what audiences expect from a character and who the character really is.</p>
<p>Musically, Celina draws inspiration from sources as eclectic as folk storytellers (Mitchell, Dylan), contemporary musical theatre artists (Sondheim, Jason Robert Brown) and, in some cases, early modern music compositions (e.g., Byzantine chants, medieval court music). She believes that her perspective as a queer, female storyteller compels her to promote stories that continue to be underrepresented in musical theatre.</p>
<p>Celina is excited for the Hollywood Fringe Festival, where she will be showcasing work with a more contemporary feel than she has produced in previous performances. </p>

<h3>About American Carnage...</h3>
<p><i>American Carnage</i> is a new play by <a href=""http://www.chewalker.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Ché Walker</a>, written in response to the inauguration and first 100 days of the presidency of Donald Trump.  <i>American Carnage</i> is a surrealist fable about America, politics, the power of anger and the choices we make to survive.  Clare Latham and Meghan Cox play Erica, a woman who's choice to survive a brutal kidnapping has led her to cleave herself in two.</p>
<p>After a successful first reading at <a href=""http://www.horizontheatre.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Horizon Theatre Company</a> in Atlanta, GA (as a companion piece to Walker's <a href=""http://www.horizontheatre.com/plays/ballad-klook-vinette/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Ballad of Klook and Vinette</a>), we are holding a reading in New York, generously hosted by our friends at <a href=""https://www.nytw.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">New York Theatre Workshop</a>, in the hopes of finding partners to help us deliver a full production in 2019.</p>

<li>Secondly, and just as importantly, if you want to play a part in driving this incredible piece of theater forward, we want to hear from you.  We are currently looking for producing partners who would help us deliver a world premiere of <i>American Carnage</i> in 2019, and if you know anyone who might be interested (or you are anyone who might be interested!), please get in touch so we can welcome you to the reading.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Reading</h3>
<p>A full, staged reading of <i>American Carnage </i>will take place at New York Theatre Workshop's 4th Street Theatre, on Wednesday, 14th November at 7pm.  The reading is free of charge, and is by invitation only for our supporters and potential partners.  We'd be so thrilled to have you join us to hear the play, if you are interested in attending, please email alexguiney@gmail.com with the number of tickets you require, and any questions you have that we can answer for you.</p>

<p><i><strong>Bolero - A Journey Celebrating Creativity</strong></i>, was created to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the White Cloud Studio of New York, the world's first center of the <strong>GYROTONIC®</strong> Method.  <strong>Juliu Horvath </strong>choreographs protagonists <strong>Elisabetta Carnevale</strong>, Prima Ballerina of the White Cloud Opera in Rome, and <strong>Jackson Kellogg</strong>.</p>
<p><i><strong>Bolero</strong></i> is inspired by texts written by the same Juliu Horvath: a journey into his own ""self"",” retracing the Master and Choreographer’s personal artistic path.</p>
<p>The choreography was born from the desire to celebrate both the <strong><i>""</i>Creativity of Being""</strong> and the creative force of the Universe.  The show is composed of three interconnected sections, each following the choreography of Horvath and other interpreters.</p>
<p>The <strong>GYROTONIC®<i> </i></strong>Method will serve as active element of the performance, with <strong>GYROKINESIS® </strong>sequences designed as tools to express the harmony of the dance. American and European dancers will join the Italian team, united by the common experience of the <strong>GYROTONIC®</strong> Method.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are Mysterious Guest Theatre company. </p>
<p>Set up by Megan Gordon and Tash McPhillips, whom are both Drama and Performance Graduates from Queen Margaret University. </p>
<p>The Black Queen is an important play to the horror genre, by bringing back the great classic style of the Grand Guignol, to the modern stage. Breathing new life into this classic and terrifying style of theatre. </p>
<p>Your contribution shall help us to achieve staging our first production in Horror Fest. All the contributions shall go toward, building the elaborate set, recording our original soundtrack, to fund marketing, by making posters and flyers to advertise the production in and around Edinburgh. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Break Down:</p>
<ul>
<li>Building and sourcing an elaborate set, to record an original soundtrack, to fund the construction and sourcing of costume and props, to print advertising posters and flyers of the production.</li>
<li>We are a new and exciting company bringing back an old classic horrifying style of theatre to the modern stage. </li>
<li>If we do not reach our entire goal, all of the money shall still go towards all of the listed technical requirements for the show. </li>
<li>By contributing to our show you shall be rewarded in return.</li>
<li>If you donate £3-£7 You shall get free entry to the show.</li>
<li>If you donate £8-£12 You shall get free entry and front row seats, there shall be ten front row seats per show.</li>
<li>If you donate £13 and above you shall get free entry, a front row seat and a free meet and greet with the cast and crew after the show. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>We believe that bringing back Grand Guignol to the centre stage of horror. </li>
<li>We have had a great success in producing show within our four years at Queen Margaret University, across many genres of theatre and gaining the skills needed to be a well run company across all elements of the theatre.</li>
<li>Although as a company we are knew, we have a great history of experience of working in the theatre, inside and outside of University including multiple shows in the Fringe. We have a vision of bringing old forgotten styles of theatre into the modern world. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenge</h3>
<p>A challenge could be putting on the technical tricks of The Grand Guignol theatre, an example of this would be creating realistic effects of gore. </p>
<p>Through rehearsals and practice we aim to create a realistic show as possible for our audiences, with the generous contributions we shall aim to achieve  the most horrifying play possible. </p>

Your contribution shall help us to achieve staging our first production in Horror Fest. All the contributions shall go toward, building the elaborate set, recording our original soundtrack, to fund marketing, by making posters and flyers to advertise the production in and around Edinburgh. 
 

What We Need & What You Get
Break Down:

Building and sourcing an elaborate set, to record an original soundtrack, to fund the construction and sourcing of costume and props, to print advertising posters and flyers of the production.
We are a new and exciting company bringing back an old classic horrifying style of theatre to the modern stage. 
If we do not reach our entire goal, all of the money shall still go towards all of the listed technical requirements for the show. 
By contributing to our show you shall be rewarded in return.
If you donate £3-£7 You shall get free entry to the show.
If you donate £8-£12 You shall get free entry and front row seats, there shall be ten front row seats per show.
If you donate £13 and above you shall get free entry, a front row seat and a free meet and greet with the cast and crew after the show. 


The Impact

We believe that bringing back Grand Guignol to the centre stage of horror. 
We have had a great success in producing show within our four years at Queen Margaret University, across many genres of theatre and gaining the skills needed to be a well run company across all elements of the theatre.
Although as a company we are knew, we have a great history of experience of working in the theatre, inside and outside of University including multiple shows in the Fringe. We have a vision of bringing old forgotten styles of theatre into the modern world. 


Risks & Challenge
A challenge could be putting on the technical tricks of The Grand Guignol theatre, an example of this would be creating realistic effects of gore. 
Through rehearsals and practice we aim to create a realistic show as possible for our audiences, with the generous contributions we shall aim to achieve  the most horrifying play possible.

<h3>Biografía.</h3> <p>Soy bailarina e interprete Venezolana de Danza Contemporánea, inicie mis estudios en la universidad Nacional Experimental de las artes, en donde aprendí acerca de las diferentes técnicas con maestros como Félix Oropeza, Hilse León, Inés Rojas, Rafael González y Rafael Nieves que enriquecieron mi mundo de un gran aprendizaje, ellos me hicieron transformar partes de mi vida a diario para que lograra cosas a nivel físico y espiritual, por ello estoy muy agradecida ya que me han hecho creer en que con la danza se puede lograr transmitir un mensaje más allá de la palabra.</p>

<p><strong>Biography</strong></p>
<p>I’m a Venezuelan dancer and interpreter of the contemporary movement. I started my studies in the National Experimental University of Arts, where I learned about different techniques with masters Félix Oropeza, Hilse León, Inés Rojas, Rafael González and Rafael Nieves. They have enlightened my world with knowledge and transformed parts of my life to accomplish goals in a physical and spiritual level. I’m pleased to admit they have made me grow and believe that dance can transmit a message beyond the written and spoken word. For me, dance is about human beings creating impossibilities. With time I started dancing around various important projects such as “Otto el Pirata”, a production from the company “Danza Hoy”; I was also invited to dance with companies like “Neodanza de Caracas” and “Caracas Rojas Laboratorio”, at last in the company “Teresa Danza Contemporanea”, with performances coming to life in the rooms of the Teresa Carreño theatre. All these experiences made me a different person. My mind started understanding the possibilities within the body to create movement and how a contemporary dance interpreter is capable of expressing and addressing every piece of her essence. Within the corporal formation and other activities that nourish life, rhythmic gymnastics has always been present in my life. As an athlete for the state and later being part of the team of coaches of the Venezuelan Federation of Rhythmics Gymnastics, I contributed as a choreographer to improve their series.</p>
<p><strong>En el presente año</strong></p>
<p>Este año me atreví a enviar una solicitud a un Festival Internacional de movimiento organizado por Técnicas de Movimiento (TDM) llamado ATLAS que se llevara a cabo en Guanajuato, México con una duración de 9 días en la fecha del  2  al 10 de agosto del 2018. Atlas es un retiro de entrenamiento para profesionales con pedagogos provenientes de Europa, Asia y Latinoamérica, que han creado herramientas para la escena contemporánea mundial, seleccionando a solo 60 artistas a nivel mundial.</p>
<p>Para  gran sorpresa  seleccionaron y aceptaron la participación dentro  del festival entre estos 60 artistas, para expandir y fortalecer las bases que con dedicación y voluntad se adquieren. Estoy dispuesta a descubrir nuevas capacidades y habilidades otorgando todo lo que se tiene junto a estos grandes coreógrafos y maestros del mundo. El festival se basa en 11 horas de entrenamiento que solo un cuerpo con alto nivel de resistencia física puede dar hasta el final.</p>

<h3>Bringing Summer Musicals Back to Little Falls</h3>
<p>In spring 2019, local theatre supporters created a new nonprofit organization, ""Little Falls Summer Musical,"" and began the process of putting on a show -- specifically <i>The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee</i> (Aug. 8-10, 2019). This will be the first summer community musical theatre production in more than a decade. Its success depends on volunteer help, cash and in-kind donations, and sponsorship support by community members who support the arts. That's where our Indiegogo campaign comes in.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We need funding for three main purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Direct costs of putting on The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee, including such things as show licensing fees, microphone rental, and materials for sets, props, and costumes, as well as ticket promotion costs.</li>
<li>Administrative costs including government filing fees, financing fees, and insurance.</li>
<li>Costs for next year's show!</li>
</ul>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>In exchange for supporting LF Summer Musical with your contribution, we'd like to thank you in the following ways (with your permission):</p>
<ul>
<li>Acknowledgment of your donation in the show programme, among the ""Director's Circle"" of financial supporters;</li>
<li>Art works created by local artists to commemorate LF Summer Musical 2019; and</li>
<li>The opportunity to see summer musicals in Little Falls!</li>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Little Falls Summer Musical relies on the support of many businesses, organizations, and individuals. An adequate level of community support of every kind will determine not only whether the 2019 show is successful, but whether LF Summer Musical can afford to produce additional shows in the future.  Some factors affecting that support are beyond our ability to control. For example, no matter how much promotion we do, ticket sales depend on factors that are difficult to predict and mostly out of our hands. </p>
<p>The LF Summer Musical team is managing these risks by taking a comprehensive and diverse approach involving many members of the community. A group of experienced advisers has provided input, guidance, and space to meet and rehearse, as well as help promoting the initiative and selling tickets.

We are a non-profit association, our successes so far we achieved whit our own pocket and a lot of work, we need donation to be able to offer even more opportunities for the participants this year. The travel, stay, food, theater tools and sets, the camp lieders payment cost money, every little donation are accepted with great love.
 
For the donators we provide free stay in a beautiful transylvanian place, participation on theater workshops and trekking with guide in the wilderness.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign
