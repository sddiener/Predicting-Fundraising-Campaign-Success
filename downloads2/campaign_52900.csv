<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>It all started with Two friends and Union brothers with a dream and passion for creating the finest and freshest craft beer possible. Founded by Zach Waltz whose in the IBEW and Jeremiah Cain who belongs to the Boilermakers. As most of you know we have officially signed our lease at 365 Mercer Road Harmony Pa 16037. It is a former Ice cream shop/ Diner that we will transform into our craft brewery and eatery. We will operate on a 3.5BBL SS Brewtech brewhouse with five 3.5BBL unitanks. We will offer 12 handcrafted in house beers on tap. We will have 52 seats on the inside and an amazing patio outside. Warmer months you will be able to enjoy the patio accompanied by live music and many outdoor games. We hope to open in early spring and can’t wait to invite everyone inside to enjoy all that we have to offer. #BeHoppyDrinkLocal</p>

With 10% of the US population following a gluten-free diet, the opportunity to produce delicious craft-brewed gluten-free beer and offer a vibrant tasting room experience became clear.Why We Need Your HelpWhile we are getting our beautiful open space in the Pepperell Mill ready and setting up our brew house, we need your help.  The biggest challenge we face upon opening is ensuring that we can package the beer to be able to share it.  Outside of the equipment to make the beer, the canner is the most expensive piece of equipment.  A high-quality canner is critical to preserving the flavor and aroma of the beer.  Your contribution here will support us getting the beer into cans, so we can get our cans into your hands.We hope you'll support Lucky Pigeon Brewing and pick up some great branded items.

<h2><strong>“The Essential Knives” to “The Energetic Knives”</strong></h2>
<p>You don’t need these knives if you have the essentials, you will be able to get by. However you may want these knives!</p>
<p>These knives bring the flair, fire and fun to the kitchen.</p>
<p>We are crafting ""energetic"" knives that are fundamentally different than most western knives. Knives that few have in their kitchen, yet when you do you will wonder why you haven't always had them.</p>
<p>You don't need a Porsche, but driving one will put a smile on your face.</p>
<h3>Our Handles</h3>
<p>We have been out fossicking through the country side again in the beautiful wine region of South Australia, McLaren Vale with our arborist mate to find more interesting woods and burls to make beautiful handles with. We have had more help from our little worker buddies too. Along with some Platypus gum burl the termites helped carve for us, we also have olive wood root with circles and holes where wood worms have worked their way through. These woods we have stabilized and cast in coloured resin to be a solid block, then to be styled into the wa- styled ""D"" handles.</p>
<p>Woods we are using are Olive Root, Platypus Gum, Brown Mallee Root, Maple Burl, Dwarf Banksia Pod and Poplar Burl.</p>

<p><strong>Our Three Knives</strong></p>
<p>This collection is a collection of three knives - the Nakiri, the Deba and Sujihiki knives. We wanted to create a collection a little more traditional to Japanese cuisine yet cross over to cover tasks in western kitchens. All three are made with the very best Japanese knife steel- 67 layer Damascus VG-10 Stainless steel. They are Japanese half tang style. The handles (along with the beautiful Damascus cloud effect) are what gives these knives their beauty and sets them apart from any other knife in the world. We use an eclectic range of woods, some from our local region and some from others. We then cast and stabilise these woods with different colours to bring them together to make the most beautiful, colourful and ""energetic"" handles to complete these knifes into true works of art. In fact, we aren't sure if these should be in an art gallery or the kitchen at times!</p>
<p>These three knives all complement each other in many ways-</p>
<p>For example- Use your Deba to cut down your protein. The thick heavy blade is great for cutting through the fish's rib cage or the chicken bones. Then you use your Nakiri to prep the veg to go with the meal. Then when your protein is cooked (or uncooked if you dining on sashimi) you can carve/ slice it into perfect portion size with the Sujihiki. Job done! This collection can work so well together for endless delights, only your imagination can hold you back!</p>

<p><strong>The Nakiri</strong></p>
<p>The Nakiri is the most used knife in Japan and it may be the same if we had them in the West. “Na” means “Vegetable” and “Kiri” means “to cut”. The first thing you notice with this knife is its rectangular shape. It is a light nimble knife that has only a slight radius on the cutting edge for ""roll"" chopping, but its big strength is ""cross"" chopping. This is where the whole knife meets the board in a single strike, chopping all in its path down the length of the cutting edge. The height of the blade, which remains slim and sharp, makes it easy to chop while the short length make it very easy to control. The Nakiri will out class a chefs knife if you are cutting fruit or veg as it’s lightweight and easy to control. The blade moves quickly and turns fruit into salad in moments.</p>
<p>If you like to work with fruit and veg - this is your knife!</p>

<p><strong>The Deba Knife</strong></p>
<p>The Deba is one of the older blades you find in Japan (but still quite rare in the west). With a heavy, strong blade heel to get through a fish head or chop through anything solid. It also has a razor sharp edge to the point to do more delicate cuts and get through the rib cage. The single bevelled edge blade is also used to run the con-curve back of the blade over the rib cage of fish to cut fillets away with the greatest of ease. This knife will accelerate the dissection of any poultry or fish, teamed with a longer blade for the final slash is also what helps us create sashimi.</p>
<p>If you like cutting fish - from lip to tail - this is the blade for you (whilst this is the known focus it also does most other things and can be used as a utility knife).</p>

<p><strong>The Sujihiki</strong></p>
<p>Last but maybe the best is the Sujihiki knife. Working with the Sujihiki is like playing the violin. Drawing the full length bow across the strings rather than slashing back and forth leads to a much cleaner cut. The kitchen becomes a construction of an orchestra and the finished look and feel of your cuts go to the next level. The Sujihiki knife is a long knife designed for long drawing cuts. You should never saw your meat, you lose all the juice and goodness in doing so. This razor sharp long edge will do it in one fowl stroke. We give our Sujihiki a Tanto Tip mainly because it looks awesome, who doesn't want to carve a roast with what looks like a Katana sword! However, the Tanto point is especially helpful when cutting sinew away from the bone.</p>

<p><i>Donate to fund the
first production line of a new alternative to sugary drinks and sodas</i></p>
<p><b>My Story:</b></p>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to read about my campaign! I
am a stay at home mom from Dallas, Texas. I have always been health-conscious
and willing to seek out the best all-natural and organic foods to feed my
family. Over the past few years, I have perfected my own healthy, all-natural,
fully organic beverage. It has become very popular within my circle of family
and friends, I can hardly keep up with the demand! </p>
<p><b>Honey Juice</b> is my own secret recipe that is sweetened
by the all-natural flavor of honey. It is naturally organic and beneficial to
adults and children! Honey Juice is a cool and refreshing alternative to
unhealthy sugary drinks and diet sodas. </p>
<p>My family &amp; friends have enjoyed the experience of Honey
Juice.  Now, I want to take this beverage
to the next level in offering it to the public so you too can enjoy the healthy
experience of Honey Juice.  In order to
turn my beverage into a business and start mass-producing it for distribution
to several stores, I need your help!</p>
<p><b>Impact:</b></p>
<p>Today’s children and teens are often not getting the
nutrition they need to let their bodies grow and thrive. Often the beverages
they consume are full of sugar, extra calories, and unnecessary harmful
ingredients and colors. Many of these artificial colors have been linked to
ADHD diagnoses and behavior issues. </p>
<p>Drinking sugary beverages can also contribute to tooth
decay, obesity, and a serious risk of developing diabetes. But at the same
time, children are drawn to sweet beverages, and it can be difficult to provide
a healthier alternative that doesn’t cause similar problems, or have unwanted
ingredients.</p>
<p>A beverage like Honey Juice provides the sweetness that
young and old crave, with the healthy ingredients and antioxidant properties
parents want for their children. Delicious both warm and cold, this is the
ideal beverage for children and teens alike! We recommend that children under
the age of one avoid the drink until later on, as it does contain honey and
that can be a health risk for little tots. </p>
<p><b>What I Need:</b></p>
<p>To fully realize my dream of selling Honey Juice to the
masses, I need to raise $50,000 to hire a beverage company to help me
mass-produce the product and help get it on high-end, organic stores such as
Whole Foods, Trader Joe’s and Sprouts, as well as super stores like Walmart,
Target, and local grocery stores as well. </p>
<p>Once we have contracted with a beverage company, we will use
any additional funding to help with marketing, advertising, and covering any
incidental costs that come along the way! We already have our “prototype”
recipe ready for the beverage company to use, and we have beta tested the
beverage among our large group of friends and family. The next step is to start
mass-production!</p>
<p>Your generous donations can go a long way! As you can
imagine, being a stay at home mom means we’re living on a strict budget. We
live comfortably and are able to make ends meet, but we really do not have the
savings to put towards this kind of project. At the same time, my husband is
incredibly supportive of my dream, and wants me to do whatever it takes to get
started. By donating to my campaign, you are helping to quickly bring this
great product to the market and you are saving me the risk of incurring high-interest
business loans.  </p>
<p>Your help will greatly be appreciated.  Please make a donation today!</p>

<h3>A Little Bit of Background</h3>
<p>Hi, my name is Paula and I'm opening a bakery in beautiful Joseph, Oregon. Vanilla Stag will be located at the new grocery store, re-opening in just a few weeks from now.</p>
<p>I've been cooking for as long as I can remember. As a young girl, I was the designated family baker and pretty soon began to see cooking as more than simply preparing food. I trained in Classical French Cuisine at the Chef Studio under the tutelage of the late Robert Reynolds. Later I co-founded <a href=""http://www.theirreverentspoon.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Irreverent Spoon</a>, a pop-up dinner club in Portland, Ore. with one of my dear culinary training peers. My professional cooking career includes some very interesting and fun jobs. From Pastry Chef/Baker at a gluten-free garden-to-table restaurant in the state of Washington's Olympic Peninsula; caterer for a wedding on a grassy labyrinth on the Columbia River Gorge; Friday night Cook at a crêperie in Portland, Ore.; to Chef for the <a href=""http://eireretour.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Eire Retour</a>, a 10-day tour in the west of Ireland.</p>
<p>My mentor Robert used to say “food tastes better when it tastes like what it is,” and his words have deeply influenced my approach to cooking and baking. I would describe my cooking style as straightforward and aimed at creating community around the table. Through this bakery, I'll get to share my passion for cooking and bring joy to the world around me.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>A Brand is Born</h3>
<p>Deer are part of the landscape in Wallowa County and it's very common to see them wondering all around. This past Winter, there was one young buck that would come by and rub his antlers on a tree right outside our back door. It was wonderful to watch and he made an impression on me.</p>
<p>One day in early January, I was walking on Wallowa Lake's east moraine brainstorming about cooking possibilities and a flash of inspiration hit all at once: the ubiquitous stag, present in our everyday lives here in Joseph, and the promise that young buck represented. And vanilla, the most foundational and approachable flavor in sweets.</p>
<p>And just like that, the Vanilla Stag brand was born. </p>

<p> </p>
<h3>What We Offer</h3>
<p>At Vanilla Stag we will produce high-quality and downright delicious sweet and savory pastries, cakes, desserts and cookies -including <i>gluten-free</i> and <i>dairy-free</i> options- year round in the heart of Joseph, Oregon.</p>
<p>We’re not looking at reinventing the world of pastries but to simply bring something special to Wallowa County. Using local and fresh ingredients whenever possible, it is our goal to introduce new flavors and to offer a contemporary approach on some familiar items. Once we get established, we also plan to start making artisanal breads in-house.</p>
<p>Our wish is to make Vanilla Stag treats memorable and contribute to making Wallowa County a culinary destination. And with your help, we can make it happen.</p>

<h3>Our Goal</h3>
<p>We have a very aggressive schedule that is dictated by the grocery store re-opening date. Our goal is to raise $15,000 in startup capital in the next 15 days. The money we raise is going to help us get the bakery going and will be covering costs like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lawyer's Fees </li>
<li>Bakery equipment, from big commercial mixers to zesters</li>
<li>Operational costs, like packaging boxes/bags, display trays, etc</li>
<li>Marketing costs from product labels to a website</li>
<li>Starting inventory, because we need a lot of flour and sugar and butter and ... sprinkles!</li>
<li>Crowdfunding Fees</li>
</ul>
<p>Your contribution means everything to us. And as a thank you, we want to offer some perks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Goodie boxes of tasty treats just for you, so whether you're near or far, you can get a taste of who we are.</li>
<li>The Cookie Love Jar: we'll have a cookie jar at the bakery with the names of everybody that contributed to the campaign to remind us daily of those who helped make Vanilla Stag possible.</li>
<li>Fun and stylish gifts, who doesn't love them?</li>

<h3>Hello Supporters!</h3>
<h3> </h3>
<p>Our passion for Italian cooking and travel has brought us through many  kitchens, ranging from the restaurants of Michelin Star chefs to the homes of shepherds, grandmothers, and farmers of Italy's varied regions.  We would like to share these culinary experiences with you through the opening of our first solo restaurant, <i>Cicala</i>.  Our menu will stem from Italy's Southern regions with a focus on handmade pastas and charcuterie, offering rustic Italian cuisine in a elegant and refined setting.</p>
<p>The opening of Cicala Restaurant will lead the North Broad Street Renaissance by bringing luxury dining back to the historic Divine Lorriane Hotel, while coinciding with the opening of the newly renovated Metropolitan Opera House, just one block north of us.              </p>

</div></div>","Hello Supporters!
 
Our passion for Italian cooking and travel has brought us through many  kitchens, ranging from the restaurants of Michelin Star chefs to the homes of shepherds, grandmothers, and farmers of Italy's varied regions.  We would like to share these culinary experiences with you through the opening of our first solo restaurant, Cicala.  Our menu will stem from Italy's Southern regions with a focus on handmade pastas and charcuterie, offering rustic Italian cuisine in a elegant and refined setting.
The opening of Cicala Restaurant will lead the North Broad Street Renaissance by bringing luxury dining back to the historic Divine Lorriane Hotel, while coinciding with the opening of the newly renovated Metropolitan Opera House, just one block north of us.

THIS IS US!


Now that you know who we are and where we live, lets get down to this awesome idea that we would love for you to be a part of.
Having passion and a business idea is easy, but the question i had to roll around in my head is what will make Seven Tree Cafe stand out from the rest. We have restaurants that offer vegan dishes, coffee shops and health shops down the road, but what would get the public super excited  if it were to launch in SA?
The drive through was my light bulb moment. Absolutely Brilliant. So i got to work.

HOW DO YOU FIND OUT WHAT THE PUBLIC WANTS? - YOU ASK!
​ I recently did a survey on what products and services vegans, vegetarians and health nuts would like to see more of in South Africa which helped me to see what is lacking in SA and how Seven Tree can fill that gap to supply the public with the goods they need and want.
I noticed that another common complaint was not having a One Stop Shop which is exactly what our aim is. 
The idea behind Seven Tree Cafe is to:

Be the first vegan drive through cafe in South Africa where you can buy  cruelty free products  or sit down, relax and choose some great food from the menu.
Open drive through cafes throughout South Africa. Once again we do not have anything like this at all in South Africa.
Promote health and wellness.
Empower and educate people.
Create job opportunities.
Support small local suppliers and  walk along side outreach organizations.
To be a leader in the market

 

​FIRST DRIVE THROUGH VEGAN WELLNESS CAFE  IN SOUTH AFRICA
We only have 3 major drive through brands in South Africa with a population of approximately 55 million people (I wont even go into why these brands are not good for your health and the environment) Our aim is to change that.

People turning to vegan, raw and healthy lifestyles is on the rise in South Africa and that is why a drive through wellness cafe is brilliant and THE TIME IS NOW because not only will it offer healthy meals for the entire family  but it will also offer a convenient shopping experience for our clients.
​
THE MOBILE APP
The App will allow clients to:

Place their take away & grocery order from any device
Pay
Receive a reference number and collect. Easy Peezy

Most people i chat to always answer with ""BUSY""  when you ask them how they are doing.     Life is fast paced, every second counts and convenience is key, i am sure most of you can relate so that is why the app combined with the drive through is going to make life a whole lot easier.
 
 GIVING BACK

We just recently launched a website called GOT 2 LOVE (www.got2love.co.za) where people can list their cruelty free business. Seven Tree will stock their products so that we support the small guy and not just the big suppliers.

<h3>Who is Blackwater Distilling?</h3>
<p>Blackwater Distilling (<a href=""http://www.blackwaterdistilling.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.blackwaterdistilling.com</a>) is the first distillery to open in MD since the closure of the last rye whiskey distillery in the early 1970s. Blackwater Distilling was formed by the Cook brothers, Chris and Jon, in 2005 but did not begin production until 2011. Being the first distillery in MD in over 30 years did not make this an easy business to start (are any of them easy?) and the economic downturn certainly didn’t help, either. We had to bootstrap every step of the way; building this company has been an effort of love (and stubbornness). Since opening on April 1, 2011, we have released ten regular spirits and several other limited run specialty spirits.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1526737741/rmqnssyluztu9evsmp7s.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We are located in Stevensville, MD, the gateway to Maryland’s Eastern Shore. We believe the Shore is a very special place, and we do everything we can to give back to our community and run our business in a fashion that is healthy for the environment, the community, and our customers. We believe strongly in traditional production methods and using all natural ingredients. As a result, our products have won numerous awards including our most recent (and fourth) Gold Medal for Sloop Betty Vodka at the New York International Wine and Spirits Competition and Best in Category (Craft Aged Rum) for our Picaroon Dark Rum at the 2017 and 2018 ADI spirits competition.</p>
<p>Since opening our doors over seven years ago, we have had almost twenty other distilleries join us in helping to rebuild the craft spirits industry in Maryland. We work together to spread our message to consumers in the mid-Atlantic.</p>
<p>Maryland recently changed their distilling licenses in a way that allows us to open a tavern and fundamentally change how we accomplish this goal. Starting the Tavern will allow customers to order cocktails rather than solely sample straight spirits.  We will be able to host mixology classes, special spirits workshops, and even social events for families and businesses. We’ll be open seven days a week and will also have food available on-site.</p>
</div><div>
<h3><strong>What do we need your help to accomplish?</strong></h3>
<p>In short, we’re asking for your help to change the way customers get to experience our brand, and our products as we continue our efforts to be part of a growing craft spirits industry in Maryland. With your help, we are expanding and moving our business from our current location to a new spot right on route 50 in Stevensville. This will give us both the operational space we need, and the indoor and outdoor space required to make Blackwater a successful Distillery and Tavern.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1526737968/kpomxogncyqgh7octzfp.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>In addition to Blackwater Distilling, Kent Island is also home to Cascia Winery and has a brewery on the way, Cult Classic Brewing. Demographics on Kent Island are also skewing towards households with disposable income, with increasing building trends favoring apartment complexes and 55 and over communities. This places Blackwater in a high visibility and easily accessible location front and center on the main tourist artery to the beach in the summer.  Blackwater Distilling is part of a local community that favors growth in the industry and homegrown businesses. It is both the right time and the right place for this expansion in every conventional sense. Add to this the increasing popularity of craft spirits, and the increasing opportunities for our existing customer base, and we feel strongly that this move will be a success.</p>
<p>So, where do you fit in?  Well… as with any move like this, we have a budget and a plan to make the move within it, but we need help funding it.  We want to have a great bar and a great outdoor entertainment space, areas where your support will be required. We’re raising money to cover the building of the bar and all mechanicals supporting it, as well as outdoor furniture, games, and, with our stretch goal, hardscaping and (hopefully, pending fire marshal approval) a firepit.  These are all areas that will help us make a great first impression as a destination, and as representatives of the craft distilling movement.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1526738065/ghjkazu7adychscfiusa.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><i>Actual bar layout may differ somewhat, although concept of use is accurate.</i></p>
<p>So, what’s the tab?  We’re looking for $40,000.  We want to build a bar that is worthy of Maryland’s rich distilling history and future. We need bar equipment including two kegerators.  As a tavern, we won’t just focus on local spirits, we’ll focus on local alcohol. We want one kegerator reserved for kegged Blackwater Distilling cocktails, and another for local beer. Our intention is to only carry local products when there is a quality local product available. We also need the basics; it’s easy to overlook them, but our customers will assume cleanliness and service will be top notch. And they will! Sinks, ice maker, and dishwasher will allow our staff the time and resources to meet those goals. While we’re still working on designs (getting close!), the bar itself should be remarkable visually, and evocative of both craft spirits and Maryland. Current visions take inspiration from oak staves, textured copper, and other natural materials.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1526742562/dld1wicg4edhwqgsjago.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Outdoors will be a key part of our operation for at least three seasons of the year. We need comfortable seating, space heaters, and games. The space is permanently covered with an 18 foot ceiling, entirely open on two sides, partially open on a third, and accessible to the tavern on the fourth. The outdoor space where drinking is permitted must be fenced off, this will include the covered space minimally, with access allowed both indoors and to the food truck.  What kind of games? Group games. We want this space to be a very comfortable and social one.</p>
<p>What’s in the stretch goal? Well, this property is blessed with space. We’d really like to increase that space by adding some hardscaping outdoors beyond the current covered space. This will allow us to increase seating and also focus on adding natural beauty to the exterior. Our goal is to add an outdoor fireplace or stone firepit with ample seating around it, and possibly a small area for music. Lastly, we would like the stretch goal to help us with planting trees. While much of this property is wooded, we’d like to plant more between our outdoor area and the highway. Part of this property was cleared when it was originally developed, and we’d like to restore native trees.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1526905795/ipvcft5xmetjchun1rog.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Lastly, what happens if we don’t reach our goal? Well, we have to prioritize the work, and it will be prioritized as presented. We’ll start our focus on the bar, move from there to the outdoor space, and from there into our stretch goal work with hardscaping and landscaping. If we don’t reach our full target, we’ll do what we have experience doing, we’ll dig deep, lean on emotional support from friends and family, and get the project done to the best of our ability. Hard work and believing got us to where we are today and paved the way for other Maryland distillers.  We don’t give up.</p>

<h3>What's in it for you?</h3>

<p>The Quid Pro Whiskey... Aside from the glorious feeling of being a part of something special, as well as something that can make you feel special (the whiskey!), we have a lot of great perks available for purchase.</p>
<p>We have some great offers and opportunities to save on items and packages that will be available at retail after the Distillery and Tavern are open for business. Buying in now gives you the opportunity to be an early adopter, come out right away and see what we have to offer, and save some money along the way.</p>
<p>We have some other perks that are similar to things we'll be offering at the Tavern, but won't be what we consider 'regular items'. We plan on offering mixology classes, we'll give you the chance for a private class for eight. We're offering private tables for the grand re-opening of the distillery and grand opening of the tavern. These are largely one time only items.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1526742453/kqunfhyo1awq8cm2wzev.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Last, we have some options that we may never offer again, chiefly, whole barrels of aged spirits. In the name of the move, we're offering up a couple barrels of Picaroon rum, and also the option to create your own barrel. We have some regulations governing how these transactions have to take place, but they're a great opportunity to have something completely unique that may never be offered again.</p>
<p>At Blackwater Distilling, we have experience with change as a business. As Maryland's first distillery, by definition, we have experienced every change in this market since it's renaissance.  We haven't done this process exactly, but we have done most of the component changes individually at some point in our recent past.  This is a big project for us, it is our primary focus with the business today, and we are looking forward to bringing you a craft spirits destination for years to come.</p>

<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1526742509/dsplmvr7db9afirbu8vp.jpg"" src=""""/></h3>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Since we already have our distilling equipment, liquor licenses at the state and federal level, and an approved location, the primary risk is construction. So far we are on budget and on time but as with all projects there is the risk that timelines may be longer than anticipated with construction costs impacted. The Indiegogo campaign addresses that risk as well as helps our team build out the tavern the way we envisioned. </p>
<p>The move: Moving our distillery to the tavern location involves many logistics, not the least of which is moving specialized distilling equipment. Blackwater’s assumption is that by hiring professional movers and mitigating risk wherever possible, there will be no impact to our schedule and the move will be as near to seamless as we dare to hope. In the event that it is not, delivery timelines may be impacted.</p>
<p>Construction: The move to the new tavern location requires a construction build-out that must meet the standards of state, local, and federal regulations. Blackwater Distilling will do everything in its power to use project management best practices to estimate its delivery date for backers. Construction, planning and zoning, and weather delays are always a possibility and may impact opening day and delivery dates to backers.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1526742693/cv4omulgsxspvpfzjuwj.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>But rest assured! We’ve already addressed a lot! We have a signed lease and will be partnering with an established (and local!) restaurant. This will provide the double benefit of putting food in people's bellies while, at the same time, we won’t be involving ourselves in any unfamiliar business models. We have county approval for zoning use, should be able to pull permits for interior work any day, and have submitted plans for approval on exterior work. Local supporters have literally put pen to paper to sign their names supporting our project as required by the county for the tavern license. We have established marketing and social media support teams in place and ready to roll. And we’re an established business with multiple award winning products that is ready to spread its wings and grow!  </p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

</div></div>","Who is Blackwater Distilling?
Blackwater Distilling (www.blackwaterdistilling.com) is the first distillery to open in MD since the closure of the last rye whiskey distillery in the early 1970s. Blackwater Distilling was formed by the Cook brothers, Chris and Jon, in 2005 but did not begin production until 2011. Being the first distillery in MD in over 30 years did not make this an easy business to start (are any of them easy?) and the economic downturn certainly didn’t help, either. We had to bootstrap every step of the way; building this company has been an effort of love (and stubbornness). Since opening on April 1, 2011, we have released ten regular spirits and several other limited run specialty spirits.

We are located in Stevensville, MD, the gateway to Maryland’s Eastern Shore. We believe the Shore is a very special place, and we do everything we can to give back to our community and run our business in a fashion that is healthy for the environment, the community, and our customers. We believe strongly in traditional production methods and using all natural ingredients. As a result, our products have won numerous awards including our most recent (and fourth) Gold Medal for Sloop Betty Vodka at the New York International Wine and Spirits Competition and Best in Category (Craft Aged Rum) for our Picaroon Dark Rum at the 2017 and 2018 ADI spirits competition.
Since opening our doors over seven years ago, we have had almost twenty other distilleries join us in helping to rebuild the craft spirits industry in Maryland. We work together to spread our message to consumers in the mid-Atlantic.
Maryland recently changed their distilling licenses in a way that allows us to open a tavern and fundamentally change how we accomplish this goal. Starting the Tavern will allow customers to order cocktails rather than solely sample straight spirits.  We will be able to host mixology classes, special spirits workshops, and even social events for families and businesses. We’ll be open seven days a week and will also have food available on-site.

What do we need your help to accomplish?
In short, we’re asking for your help to change the way customers get to experience our brand, and our products as we continue our efforts to be part of a growing craft spirits industry in Maryland. With your help, we are expanding and moving our business from our current location to a new spot right on route 50 in Stevensville. This will give us both the operational space we need, and the indoor and outdoor space required to make Blackwater a successful Distillery and Tavern.

In addition to Blackwater Distilling, Kent Island is also home to Cascia Winery and has a brewery on the way, Cult Classic Brewing. Demographics on Kent Island are also skewing towards households with disposable income, with increasing building trends favoring apartment complexes and 55 and over communities. This places Blackwater in a high visibility and easily accessible location front and center on the main tourist artery to the beach in the summer.  Blackwater Distilling is part of a local community that favors growth in the industry and homegrown businesses. It is both the right time and the right place for this expansion in every conventional sense. Add to this the increasing popularity of craft spirits, and the increasing opportunities for our existing customer base, and we feel strongly that this move will be a success.
So, where do you fit in?  Well… as with any move like this, we have a budget and a plan to make the move within it, but we need help funding it.  We want to have a great bar and a great outdoor entertainment space, areas where your support will be required. We’re raising money to cover the building of the bar and all mechanicals supporting it, as well as outdoor furniture, games, and, with our stretch goal, hardscaping and (hopefully, pending fire marshal approval) a firepit.  These are all areas that will help us make a great first impression as a destination, and as representatives of the craft distilling movement.

Actual bar layout may differ somewhat, although concept of use is accurate.
So, what’s the tab?  We’re looking for $40,000.  We want to build a bar that is worthy of Maryland’s rich distilling history and future. We need bar equipment including two kegerators.  As a tavern, we won’t just focus on local spirits, we’ll focus on local alcohol. We want one kegerator reserved for kegged Blackwater Distilling cocktails, and another for local beer. Our intention is to only carry local products when there is a quality local product available. We also need the basics; it’s easy to overlook them, but our customers will assume cleanliness and service will be top notch. And they will! Sinks, ice maker, and dishwasher will allow our staff the time and resources to meet those goals. While we’re still working on designs (getting close!), the bar itself should be remarkable visually, and evocative of both craft spirits and Maryland. Current visions take inspiration from oak staves, textured copper, and other natural materials.

Outdoors will be a key part of our operation for at least three seasons of the year. We need comfortable seating, space heaters, and games. The space is permanently covered with an 18 foot ceiling, entirely open on two sides, partially open on a third, and accessible to the tavern on the fourth. The outdoor space where drinking is permitted must be fenced off, this will include the covered space minimally, with access allowed both indoors and to the food truck.  What kind of games? Group games. We want this space to be a very comfortable and social one.
What’s in the stretch goal? Well, this property is blessed with space. We’d really like to increase that space by adding some hardscaping outdoors beyond the current covered space. This will allow us to increase seating and also focus on adding natural beauty to the exterior. Our goal is to add an outdoor fireplace or stone firepit with ample seating around it, and possibly a small area for music. Lastly, we would like the stretch goal to help us with planting trees. While much of this property is wooded, we’d like to plant more between our outdoor area and the highway. Part of this property was cleared when it was originally developed, and we’d like to restore native trees.

Lastly, what happens if we don’t reach our goal? Well, we have to prioritize the work, and it will be prioritized as presented. We’ll start our focus on the bar, move from there to the outdoor space, and from there into our stretch goal work with hardscaping and landscaping. If we don’t reach our full target, we’ll do what we have experience doing, we’ll dig deep, lean on emotional support from friends and family, and get the project done to the best of our ability. Hard work and believing got us to where we are today and paved the way for other Maryland distillers.  We don’t give up.

What's in it for you?

The Quid Pro Whiskey... Aside from the glorious feeling of being a part of something special, as well as something that can make you feel special (the whiskey!), we have a lot of great perks available for purchase.
We have some great offers and opportunities to save on items and packages that will be available at retail after the Distillery and Tavern are open for business. Buying in now gives you the opportunity to be an early adopter, come out right away and see what we have to offer, and save some money along the way.
We have some other perks that are similar to things we'll be offering at the Tavern, but won't be what we consider 'regular items'. We plan on offering mixology classes, we'll give you the chance for a private class for eight. We're offering private tables for the grand re-opening of the distillery and grand opening of the tavern. These are largely one time only items.

Last, we have some options that we may never offer again, chiefly, whole barrels of aged spirits. In the name of the move, we're offering up a couple barrels of Picaroon rum, and also the option to create your own barrel. We have some regulations governing how these transactions have to take place, but they're a great opportunity to have something completely unique that may never be offered again.
At Blackwater Distilling, we have experience with change as a business. As Maryland's first distillery, by definition, we have experienced every change in this market since it's renaissance.  We haven't done this process exactly, but we have done most of the component changes individually at some point in our recent past.  This is a big project for us, it is our primary focus with the business today, and we are looking forward to bringing you a craft spirits destination for years to come.


Risks & Challenges
Since we already have our distilling equipment, liquor licenses at the state and federal level, and an approved location, the primary risk is construction. So far we are on budget and on time but as with all projects there is the risk that timelines may be longer than anticipated with construction costs impacted. The Indiegogo campaign addresses that risk as well as helps our team build out the tavern the way we envisioned. 
The move: Moving our distillery to the tavern location involves many logistics, not the least of which is moving specialized distilling equipment. Blackwater’s assumption is that by hiring professional movers and mitigating risk wherever possible, there will be no impact to our schedule and the move will be as near to seamless as we dare to hope. In the event that it is not, delivery timelines may be impacted.
Construction: The move to the new tavern location requires a construction build-out that must meet the standards of state, local, and federal regulations. Blackwater Distilling will do everything in its power to use project management best practices to estimate its delivery date for backers. Construction, planning and zoning, and weather delays are always a possibility and may impact opening day and delivery dates to backers.

But rest assured! We’ve already addressed a lot! We have a signed lease and will be partnering with an established (and local!) restaurant. This will provide the double benefit of putting food in people's bellies while, at the same time, we won’t be involving ourselves in any unfamiliar business models. We have county approval for zoning use, should be able to pull permits for interior work any day, and have submitted plans for approval on exterior work. Local supporters have literally put pen to paper to sign their names supporting our project as required by the county for the tavern license. We have established marketing and social media support teams in place and ready to roll. And we’re an established business with multiple award winning products that is ready to spread its wings and grow!

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Got a dollar to share? There are 1.2 million vegans in the US alone...if just a tiny fraction of those gave $1 we could have the most awesome nut milk maker ever!! </p>
<p>The world of food is changing! More and more people are cooking (and eating) without dairy milk and animal products. Whether it be for health, social justice, or the environment, veganism is picking up steam. Every day I feel such joy to be alive in the age of compassion and consciousness. We are so awesome!! </p>
<p>My name is Susana Romatz. My partner and I started our Avellana journey five years ago, commercially producing vegan cheese made from hazelnut milk. While this was very rewarding, we found that the price we had to charge was prohibitive for many.That weighed on us a lot. When a distributor who was interested in getting our cheeses into a larger market approached us, we realized that the price was going to go up even higher. We were at a turning point. We would either need to go big and expensive, or reconsider our goals and methods. Did we want to produce a cheese that only a small percentage of people could afford? Or was it time to take a different tack and re-examine our mission?</p>
<p>We decided to change direction. While we so appreciate (and often purchase) awesome pre-made vegan cheeses, for us, showing people how to make their own crazy delicious vegan cheese and providing the very best tools to do so, made more sense to us. Teaching people allows everyone the opportunity to grow and learn like we did as we developed our cheese, as well as keeping the cost of the final products lower, reducing packaging, and increasing self-sufficiency.</p>
<p>The machines that are available on the market to date are mostly lacking in power. We tried to use our juicer to make nut milk to poor results, because a lot of the nut material wasn't fully broken down, wasting the good fats and proteins locked inside the cellulose. We quickly realized that the only way to really extract as much goodness as is possible from the fibrous nuts, is to use a machine to grind them up completely, then use centrifugal force to sling out those delicious fats and proteins. So we ended up buying a commercial grade soy milk maker to do the job. Unfortunately, when it arrived we realized it wasn't engineered or constructed the way we needed it to be for this job of extracting. We took out parts, drew up plans, and had some new parts tooled from food grade plastics. In essence, we made our own custom nut milk separator that we used to extract hundreds of gallons of the best hazelnut milk ever made.</p>
<p>Once we stopped producing our cheeses, I realized that what the world needs is a way to make really delicious nut milks without a damp, squishy nut milk bag or wasting expensive nut materials on machines that aren't powerful enough to properly break down their fibers. A machine that would transform the fibers extracted into a usable flour, rather than compost or further waste materials. </p>
<p>I started drawing up plans and the Avellana Separator was born. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need to Make the Machine a Reality:</h3>
<p>I hired an engineer to draw up preliminary plans for a prototype and to produce a rough design model of my idea (pictured in the video). Next, I partnered up with an company that does ""end to end"" product development. End to end means that they examine my CAD files, help me come up with a working prototype, and together we will produce a line of separators for retail.</p>
<p>We need $2,000 to move forward to the next phase of prototype review. After that we will need another big chunk of money to move forward into building a functional prototype. My hope is that once we meet the first $2,000 goal and can refine the idea, more people will sign on to to help with the final costs.</p>
<p>Though we have a patent pending beta prototype that shows the basics on how this separator works, we need further product evaluation, engineering, research, and testing to finalize a working prototype. Once we reach this goal, we will move into phase two of our fundraising plan, which will allow us to reach out to the larger manufacturing facilities necessary to produce a small initial run of manufactured separators. </p>
<h3>Where will your money go?</h3>
<p>In more detail, the money we are raising will be spent in this way:</p>
<p>Stage 1. Research, mechanical engineering, concept refinement, and CAD review at a cost of $2,000. </p>
<p>Stage 2. Alpha prototyping, materials, developing proof of concept, parts fabrication and assembly, and testing at a cost of $9,000-$20,000. </p>
<p>Stage 3. Product refinement, CAD refinement, designing and manufacturing modifications, and fully field testable beta prototyping at a cost of $8,000-$12,000. </p>
<p>Once we get to this point in the process, we will have a fully functioning nut milk separator and we can use that beta prototype to secure the funding necessary to manufacture a run of 1,000-10,000 separators. </p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There is a LOT of work that needs to go into this process before the finished results come to our doors. You might ask yourself, why would I trust this process with my hard earned money? How do I know that this product will come to fruition? Well, though there are no guarantees in life...anyone who knows me will attest that I am not a quitter. I believe that this product will help change the way we make food. Not to mention the fact that I desperately need this product to make my life easier, healthier, and tastier. I've personally invested thousands of dollars into this project to get it to this point. </p>
<p>That, coupled with the fact that I am working with world class engineers and product manufacturing experts, with your help we will see this product through to completion. Give a dollar, give five dollars, whatever you feel comfortable doing. Also, share this campaign to all your friends!! Maybe, just maybe, we can get something cool made. </p>

<p><strong>Who Am I?</strong></p>
<p>My name is Rashe Malcolm, owner of Rashe's Cuisine, wife, and mother of 4. I started Rashe's Cuisine as a teenager focusing on providing meals to the elderly and families that could not otherwise afford catering services of quality, healthy, and cultured foods. I also taught young girls and latch key kids how to prepare quick meals for themselves and their family. Today, Rashe's Cuisine continues to cater, deliver and provide food to the communities I serve. Until recently, I also ran a Jamaican To Go brick and mortar restaurant on Tallassee Road.</p>
<p>I recently lost my brick and mortar restaurant to a ceiling collapse that flooded the restaurant and then subsequent sale to another restaurant, all within less than a week span. Instead of giving up, I have used this situation as an opportunity to finally achieve a dream. I'm finally going to realize my dream of operating Rashe's Cuisine,  Jamaican-To-Go as a mobile food trailer. so I can continue the work I love. </p>
<p>I'm reaching out to you, my community, to raise the money for the necessary deposit on the food trailer. The food trailer will allow me to realize my long-time vision to be more visible in my community and also own my kitchen, two things that are very important to me.  </p>

<p>As I'm working through the Small Business Administration (SBA) for a loan to purchase the food trailer, the SBA requires me to have a deposit of $9,000 as my down payment for the loan. Where you can help is by pre-purchasing food plates. My goal is to pre-sale 900 plates of food at $10 per plate whether individual or by groups. This will allow me to EARN the necessary funds I need to put the down payment on my food trailer. Do you have a family reunion, office party, training, employee appreciation, lunch n' learn or just your next family meal that you need someone to provide food for? Pre-purchase those plates through this crowd-funding campaign.  Want to support, but financially you can't?

</div></div>","Short Summary

Eventually, more options will be available for ordering.


Risks & Challenges
My main obstacle is starting this business by myself. 

With the money, this will solve all of my problems because I have the support of my friends at Eataly, and am constantly trying new recipes. I have the determination to make this business a success to bring sweets to Brooklyn/ New York. 
Eventually, I can send goods to other states for those who aren't in New York.

<p><strong><u>Overview</u></strong></p>
<p>Hello, my name is Ronn from Connellsville Pennsylvania.  I have a great work ethic and have a lot of experience in the hospitality and tourism sector.    I am passionate about great food and good nutrition. During this time of covid 19, I would love to bring great food into my community and I’d like your help to be able to do that. My business idea is to use a travelling food truck to bring great food to you for breakfast, lunch and dinner.   I want to focus on awesome home cooked food, superb service, and being able to help people in need and struggling with the conditions covid 19 has created.  I’d love to do that by creating food for carers and key workers, and I hope to be able to serve a free hot meal to someone in need. I’m very excited about the opportunity to help people who are less fortunate.</p>
<p>I have just a few short weeks to make it all happen.  I have a great opportunity to purchase a food truck that is an established business.  The aim of this campaign is to raise the funds to do just that.   I would like to be very mobile and deliver food to local businesses, work sites, festivals, colleges and do awesome catering and provide great food.</p>
<p>I’m really counting on my family and friends for support because the traditional banking methods just didn’t work. COVID-19 hit many people hard and I am no different.  This campaign is about doing something for the community, so I’m asking the community to support me, to help make this happen. </p>
<p>Delicious home-cooked food for everyone is the goal and hopefully a few ethnic days also. I’ll have a lunch menu that is sandwiches like veggie wraps, ham barbecue, hotdogs, sloppy Joe’s, potato salad,  macaroni salad and fresh salads. I will also have sodas, water, fresh fruit, potato chips, and candy bars.  On the ethnic days the truck will be serving food such as Polish pierogi, haluski, sauerkraut and pork.  Italian gnocchi and meatballs, lasagna, stromboli, fettuccine Alfredo.   Mexican tacos, burritos and pinto beans. The early morning crowd can also get coffee, fruit salads, smoothies, juices, pastries and donuts. I have a plan and as I develop the catering business, down the road I will add breakfast sandwiches.</p>
<p><b><u>Goals</u></b></p>
<ol>
<li>My goal for the project is $30,000 which would cover the cost of the truck and box ($17,000) , Ice machine ($3000), freezer ($3000), waterline to garage for ice machine ($4000),  and the remainder for start up food and products. If the entire goal is not met, the first purchase would be the truck and box.</li>
<li>Create a food truck to bring great food to the community and help make things better during covid 19</li>
<li>Help me work with colleagues to bring our community breakfast, lunch and dinner.  By doing that, I hope to be able to work with colleagues who have been impacted by covid 19 and want to get back to work. </li>
<li>Say thanks to our care workers and key workers by giving them a community food truck that offers a discount for their hard work during this time. </li>
<li>Its hard just now, and help offer a free meal to those who’ve been hard hit by the effects of covid 19 and the lock down. </li>
<li>At the end of the weeks, food that hasn’t been sold, will go to the homeless shelter / community center.</li>
</ol>
<p><b><u>Specifications</u></b></p>
<p>I’m asking for a contributions of $50 dollars, but any contribution will help. And definitely read about the contributing perks such as food vouchers, mugs and tee shirts.  Don't forget to share share share.  You can help share this by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tweeting the link to my campaign</li>
<li>Share me on facebook and linked in</li>
<li>Share on instagram, Tumblr  and snapchat</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><b><u>Milestones</u></b></p>
<ol><li><p><b>30 days to raise the funds</b></p></li></ol>
<p>I have 30 days to raise the funds, that’s $1,000 dollars a day.  I need your help to find 20             backers to help fund the project for $50 each for my project each day.

</div></div>","Overview
Hello, my name is Ronn from Connellsville Pennsylvania.  I have a great work ethic and have a lot of experience in the hospitality and tourism sector.    I am passionate about great food and good nutrition. During this time of covid 19, I would love to bring great food into my community and I’d like your help to be able to do that. My business idea is to use a travelling food truck to bring great food to you for breakfast, lunch and dinner.   I want to focus on awesome home cooked food, superb service, and being able to help people in need and struggling with the conditions covid 19 has created.  I’d love to do that by creating food for carers and key workers, and I hope to be able to serve a free hot meal to someone in need. I’m very excited about the opportunity to help people who are less fortunate.
I have just a few short weeks to make it all happen.  I have a great opportunity to purchase a food truck that is an established business.  The aim of this campaign is to raise the funds to do just that.   I would like to be very mobile and deliver food to local businesses, work sites, festivals, colleges and do awesome catering and provide great food.
I’m really counting on my family and friends for support because the traditional banking methods just didn’t work. COVID-19 hit many people hard and I am no different.  This campaign is about doing something for the community, so I’m asking the community to support me, to help make this happen. 
Delicious home-cooked food for everyone is the goal and hopefully a few ethnic days also. I’ll have a lunch menu that is sandwiches like veggie wraps, ham barbecue, hotdogs, sloppy Joe’s, potato salad,  macaroni salad and fresh salads. I will also have sodas, water, fresh fruit, potato chips, and candy bars.  On the ethnic days the truck will be serving food such as Polish pierogi, haluski, sauerkraut and pork.  Italian gnocchi and meatballs, lasagna, stromboli, fettuccine Alfredo.   Mexican tacos, burritos and pinto beans. The early morning crowd can also get coffee, fruit salads, smoothies, juices, pastries and donuts. I have a plan and as I develop the catering business, down the road I will add breakfast sandwiches.
Goals

My goal for the project is $30,000 which would cover the cost of the truck and box ($17,000) , Ice machine ($3000), freezer ($3000), waterline to garage for ice machine ($4000),  and the remainder for start up food and products. If the entire goal is not met, the first purchase would be the truck and box.
Create a food truck to bring great food to the community and help make things better during covid 19
Help me work with colleagues to bring our community breakfast, lunch and dinner.  By doing that, I hope to be able to work with colleagues who have been impacted by covid 19 and want to get back to work. 
Say thanks to our care workers and key workers by giving them a community food truck that offers a discount for their hard work during this time. 
Its hard just now, and help offer a free meal to those who’ve been hard hit by the effects of covid 19 and the lock down. 
At the end of the weeks, food that hasn’t been sold, will go to the homeless shelter / community center.

Specifications
I’m asking for a contributions of $50 dollars, but any contribution will help. And definitely read about the contributing perks such as food vouchers, mugs and tee shirts.  Don't forget to share share share.  You can help share this by:

Milestones
30 days to raise the funds
I have 30 days to raise the funds, that’s $1,000 dollars a day.  I need your help to find 20             backers to help fund the project for $50 each for my project each day. What that gets you is a community food truck bringing great food and maybe helping give a hot meal to someone in need during some really hard times.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><u><strong>WE ARE BRIDGETOWN MONROE</strong></u></h3>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i><u><strong>We have Business plans, profit and loss and cash flow figures to share for all large investments. Please just drop us a message for further details. </strong></u></i></p>
<p>Bridgetown Monroe is something iconic, unique and something we all need, especially during these troubling times. Bridgetown Monroe started out as a mobile bar. It doesn't look like your cliché mobile bar. There is no converted horse boxes or Citroen vans. We serve from the iconic Chevy C-10 pickup truck. Registered in 1970, we carefully and tastefully transformed the truck into a bar. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1603190685/vheljxfwu6csmt47pcqm.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The design of the bar is secret, all hidden within the bed of the truck. Once the truck is at the venue, given 5 minutes, the truck converts into a simply but very tasteful bar. The best thing about our bar, we actually drive it to parties, events and festivals. With ease, it roars up, instantly turns heads, and then creates the most iconic cocktails and Prosecco. </p>
<p>Following three incredibly successful years with the mobile bar, we have decided to move our bar into a bricks and mortar bar. Why you ask? Because everyone needs an epic, go to, heart pumping bar on their high street that creates memories, experiences and thrills. </p>
<p>Bridgetown Monroe will be the staple on Hitchin's high street. It will be the go to venue that not only creates a place to absorb, but it will also work with local business's to help re build the high street. The high street has been diminished for many years and as a result of Covid has only declined even more. We want to link with like minded business to offer joint services to keep the high street thriving and for Bridgetown Monroe to be a partner more than competition. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1603190713/uvozslapy7i8rqtnr5g4.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We are based 100% on customer service and experience so our customers are the world to us. If we don't offer the unique service we promise and deliver the most delicious cocktails they expect then we completely fall flat and don't deserve to operate. </p>
<p>For us to succeed with need our customers to be by our side, we offer what we do because of our customers. This is the first time Bridgetown Monroe has done fund raising and it is a very important part of our journey. Customers who can donate will become part of the Bridgetown family and grow with us as we become a firm member of the high street. </p>
<p>The funding will help launch the bar on the high street. In essence we will be a Tiki bar created stunning cocktails and offer a place to dance and catch up with friends and loved ones. The funding will help kit the bar out to a very high standard. For it to be an experience you have to feel like you are being transported to someone different. An escape from the norm. We all have individual battles, some big some small, and our bar needs to be that refuge at times. </p>
<p>Without this funding we can't create the place we have always dreamed of. We don't want to do it half hearted. It will take money, a decent amount, a lot of dedication and hard work and a loyal fan base to make Bridgetown Monroe the place to be.</p>
<p>_________________</p>
</div><div>
<h3><u><i>What We Need &amp; What You Get</i></u></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>We have hired one of the best consultants in the business to see our plan through. He has carefully managed expectations, designs, budgets and profit and loss calculations to make every air tight. Especially when it comes to seeking funds from our customers, we want everything perfect before we get to that stage. It would be rude of us to ask for money when we weren't 100% guaranteed of its success. </p>
<p>In total we are seeking £100,000 to get the bar kitted out, to make it tick every box we have envisaged and to allow the two months of trading easier. We plan to launch the bar in July 2021. Any earlier then it would be silly going off current Covid climates. We are handed the premises on the 1st of March and we want to take 4 months to really build the place up. Kit the bar out to such a high spec it will feel like no other. We have designers and art directors on board to professionally build the bar. We want customers to walk in, and jaws drop. </p>
<p>Hitchin where the bar will be, is a beautiful market town steeped in history. The buildings are beautifully designed with character and stories and our bar will sit in probably the most iconic building in Hitchin. Hawkins department store which has been a staple of Hitchin's high street for over 100 years has now closed and is under renovation to split it into 5 units, Bridgetown Monroe being one of them. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1603190839/gxvukugirgxvjvv8gjlb.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The funding will be spent wisely. It will be going towards furniture, flooring, design of the actual bar, wall designs, props, bar materials, music systems and tills. The furniture is going to be sourced globally, looking for unique one off pieces that will not only look the part but feel like a cloud to sit on. Tables will be in all shapes and sizes, finishes and designs. Everything will be a mix but all carefully in keeping. </p>
<p>Flooring will be mix of vintage tiling and polished concrete with gold leaf lava rivers leading the customer to the bar. </p>
<p>The walls will be a mixture of beautifully deep Farrow and Ball paint that will have a matt warm effect to it and tropical life sized palm tree wallpaper. The bar will be heavily adorned with tropical plants. All real. They will be shaped and potted to fit around the room. </p>
<p>In the corner of the room will be a Instagram corner. A corner that demands a selfie in front of. Lashings of palm trees, Tiki statues and comfy arm chairs. </p>
<p>Glassware and Tiki will be premium. We do believe its about the glass you drink it out of too. You wouldn't want a glass of ice cold beer in a champagne glass. We stand by this. </p>
<p>The money raised will be meticulously documented and relayed back to our investors if you required and we really want you to come on this beautiful journey with us. Without your kind investments we couldn't do it, and without your custom with wouldn't want to do it. </p>
<p>Onto the perks. You need to be rewarded for your kind investment and this is something that will be done handsomely. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1603190884/oehixakyjeohjk5bnyyf.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We have several different levels of investment and rewards and its down to you which one you go with. </p>

<p>We do hope to raise the entire £100,000 for the bar, but for any reason we don't manage to hit the cap, your investment will stand by the reward you will receive and the bar will open through other avenues of funding. We don't want to do down this route as we really want our customers to be part of our journey and for everyone that does invest, the world around Bridgetown Monroe will know about it. </p>
<p>We have  the very best consultant working on the financials of the bar and have a very extensive business plan and Profit and Loss/Cashflow ready to share for anyone that wants to invest large amounts. Please at anytime message chris@bridgetownmonroe.com for further details. </p>

<h3><u><i>The Impact</i></u></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Now you will be thinking, if I don't live local why would I invest in the bar. I would question the same thing, but here at Bridgetown Monroe we wholeheartedly believe the high street is crumbling beneath us and this is one of the core reasons we want to open a bricks and mortar bar. Working closely with the other local venues to set up partnerships, we want to build healthy profitable workable futures that keeps people returning to the high streets. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1603190908/qejm3ksune7vj3yh78jc.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>You will always be part of the BTM family if you invest, regardless of your investment amount and will always be welcomed into the bar with open arms. Probably with a free drink or two. We are very loyal and dedicated to our customers and fans. If you don't live local you are more than welcome to chose from our merchandise store which is launching soon so you can always have a bit of Bridgetown Monroe close by. </p>
<p>You will also know you personally have contributed to keeping a high street open and thriving. </p>

<h3><u><i>Risks &amp; Challenges</i></u></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>With any business comes risks. We would be silly to think otherwise, but we have countermeasures in place to deal with this if it ever did arise. Our contracts with the landlords are super tight and pandemic protected and have many avenues to bring in profit if our bar is forced to close due to another lockdown. We have picked July as well hoping we will be a lot more free than currently. </p>
<p>We have a very loyal accountant and booker who has been with us for 8 years through thick and thin and knows our accounts exceptionally well and always been by our side. </p>
<p>The owner of the bar Chris will be the manager. Nothing speaks passion and pride then the owner running the bar day to day. He knows hospitality, he knows customer service and knows how to succeed. Having launched the Bridgetown Monroe brand only 3 years ago, it is already known worldwide. He doesn't fail at anything because he has that drive and succession ingrained in him. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are committed to opening the first woman black-owned mobile coffee truck in Charles County, Maryland December 2020.  </p>
<p>The Grind House is a mobile coffee truck with plans to base its initial location in Charles County, Maryland. The Grind House derives its name from its owners love for hard work and coffee. With that said, the name has a twofold meaning: grind as in hard work and in coffee grind. Our mission is to serve the community with great coffee and excellent customer service to include a bit of hospitality, all the while encouraging people to pursue their dreams. </p>
<p>The Grind House will feature a full menu of moderately priced coffee, espresso drinks, hot and cold teas, bagels, sandwiches, salads and seasonal soups.  Each cup of coffee will be served with a motivational note of encouragement.  </p>
<p>Our vision is to build an empire that starts in Charles County, Maryland and grows throughout the United States and eventually, internationally. Supporting our campaign will not only help us become the first woman black-owned coffee truck in Charles County, MD, but it will also afford other small businesses in the area with opportunities for advancement. As we always say, we want to get the community involved so that we can all evolve.  </p>
<p>A percentage of proceeds will go towards small business grants to help entrepreneurs pursue their dreams and all excess food and drinks will be provided to the homeless. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Currently Have</h3>
<ul>
<li>Salaries for our Consultants and Employees</li>
<li>Dry supplies for one year (hot and cold cups, drink holders, cup sleeves, stirrers, etc.)</li>
<li>Commissary Kitchen</li>
</ul>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>To continue turning this dream into a reality, we need at least $45,000 to get started. Some of you may be shocked by the asking; we are confident that with your help, we will meet this goal!  We have received several quotes and have participated in many walkthroughs of food trucks with various companies. After long hours of researching, quotes, and walkthroughs we’ve decided on a coffee distributor, builder, and the equipment. </p>
<ul>
<li>The coffee truck and build out: $34,000 (mock-up and invoice below) </li>
<li>The coffee equipment : $9,000 </li>
<li>Supplies for 1 year: $2,000  </li>
</ul>
<p>To keep you at ease we wanted to share a few things to ensure you that The Grind House is here to stay. We have an established business plan, financial manager, communications manager, coffee consultant, investor, a pandemic proof plan, and plans for yearly expansion. </p>
<p>By donating to The Grind House you will receive awesome perks such as pre-paid coffee and tea, t-shirts, sweatshirts, and more!</p>

<h3>Pandemic Proof</h3>
<p>You may be thinking, “WOW” this is a great idea but how will it sustain in a pandemic?” Well, we’ve also asked ourselves that question, and therefore have created a pandemic proof plan which includes: contactless delivery, a drive thru option and a monthly coffee membership. </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>

</div></div>","Short Summary
We are committed to opening the first woman black-owned mobile coffee truck in Charles County, Maryland December 2020.  
The Grind House is a mobile coffee truck with plans to base its initial location in Charles County, Maryland. The Grind House derives its name from its owners love for hard work and coffee. With that said, the name has a twofold meaning: grind as in hard work and in coffee grind. Our mission is to serve the community with great coffee and excellent customer service to include a bit of hospitality, all the while encouraging people to pursue their dreams. 
The Grind House will feature a full menu of moderately priced coffee, espresso drinks, hot and cold teas, bagels, sandwiches, salads and seasonal soups.  Each cup of coffee will be served with a motivational note of encouragement.  
Our vision is to build an empire that starts in Charles County, Maryland and grows throughout the United States and eventually, internationally. Supporting our campaign will not only help us become the first woman black-owned coffee truck in Charles County, MD, but it will also afford other small businesses in the area with opportunities for advancement. As we always say, we want to get the community involved so that we can all evolve.  
A percentage of proceeds will go towards small business grants to help entrepreneurs pursue their dreams and all excess food and drinks will be provided to the homeless. 

What We Currently Have

Salaries for our Consultants and Employees
Dry supplies for one year (hot and cold cups, drink holders, cup sleeves, stirrers, etc.)
Commissary Kitchen

What We Need & What You Get
To continue turning this dream into a reality, we need at least $45,000 to get started. Some of you may be shocked by the asking; we are confident that with your help, we will meet this goal!  We have received several quotes and have participated in many walkthroughs of food trucks with various companies. After long hours of researching, quotes, and walkthroughs we’ve decided on a coffee distributor, builder, and the equipment. 

The coffee truck and build out: $34,000 (mock-up and invoice below) 
The coffee equipment : $9,000 
Supplies for 1 year: $2,000  

To keep you at ease we wanted to share a few things to ensure you that The Grind House is here to stay. We have an established business plan, financial manager, communications manager, coffee consultant, investor, a pandemic proof plan, and plans for yearly expansion. 
By donating to The Grind House you will receive awesome perks such as pre-paid coffee and tea, t-shirts, sweatshirts, and more!


Pandemic Proof
You may be thinking, “WOW” this is a great idea but how will it sustain in a pandemic?” Well, we’ve also asked ourselves that question, and therefore have created a pandemic proof plan which includes: contactless delivery, a drive thru option and a monthly coffee membership.

Both of which have been brought to fruition in Darksword Armory’s forge in Montreal, Canada.

For the past 23 years, Eyal Azerad has been manufacturing high end European swords and armors for private collectors and important movie and gaming productions. Most notably, Eyal Azerad has worked closely with Ubisoft during the making of Assassin's Creed II and the weapons for the Lord of the Rings theater adaptation. Both of which have been brought to fruition in Darksword Armory’s forge in Montreal, Canada. By travelling to museums and private collections in Europe and  Japan, Eyal was able to carefully examine blades from all over the world from a standpoint of design, functionality and metallurgical composition. This affords him with a unique perspective on what makes a blade effective and elegant in both form and function.After years of development, the Myoshi lines stem from a deep desire to create unique, high end professional chef knives combined with clean designs. To this end, we sourced the highest quality materials to produce a beautiful work of art. It would not only be a stunning piece in any kitchen, but prove to be an exceptional knife for both cooking enthusiasts and professionals alike. We extensively examined various types of wood to compare the different grains, weights and hardness. We  crafted an ergonomic grip that has long lasting performance without compromising aesthetic beauty.This enabled us to mesh Japanese blade designs with modern European styling, resulting into a luxurious work of art, surpassing the mere classification of ""kitchen knives"".  We decided to create two distinct premium knife sets, one fitted with VG10 Titanium coated Premium Japanese steel (The Hisashi Collection) and the other set with AUS10,  67 layer folded Japanese steel (The Shogun Collection).

<h2>Who are we?</h2>
<p>We are Cocoa Metro, makers of ready-to-drink Belgian chocolate milk to help chocolate addicts thrive in a kiddy chocolate milk world. We are sold at Whole Foods Markets and many other fine food markets across the country. We also make and sell an organic Belgian hot drinking chocolate mix, organic unsweetened Belgian cocoa powder, and an organic chocolate-infused vanilla extract. We believe there is so much more depth of flavor and enjoyment to be had in really good chocolate. Not enough time to waste on the kid stuff.</p>
<p>Perhaps you grew up on Nesquik too? I drank gallons of it with my cousins during late night sleepovers. We would scoop way more of it into our glasses than prescribed on the carton because we were looking for more chocolate taste. Now that I've tried a few nice chocolates (ok, like metric tons of nice chocolate) from around the world, I am not satisfied with an overly sweet, dumbed down chocolate flavor. We are here to provide you (and me really) a deeper chocolate drinking experience than you can find anywhere in stores right now.</p>
<p>Are we the underdog? Um, yes. By a long shot. But, with your help, we plan on pulling off a Hoosiers - David &amp; Goliath - 1980's Olympic Hockey Team - Rudy - Rocky - Karate Kid win with this project. You have the power to make it happen.</p>

We've seen many on our journey so far. One area of focus is the solubility of the powder. Although we have consulted in depth with companies that provide agglomeration services, until our specific recipe is run through their process, we can't know for certain how well it will blend. There is no reason for it not to work—agglomeration is a tried and true method for creating soluble powders—but until it's done, there is the question.

About 3 million men are living in America right now with prostate cancer and about 28000 will die this year.   Prostate cancer will affect about 1 in 7 men over their lifetime.  This campaign will allow me to continue the pursuit of something I love while helping someone you may know.What I Need, What You Get & What I DoAll proceeds above my anticipated barrel cost of $9500 are committed to the Foundation and prostate cancer research.  The Foundation currently operates with an expense rate of 0.0% (I pay the costs.)  You get the wine (see Perks).  I get the satisfaction of making wine and doing something useful.  In the four fiscal years the Foundation has been operational, we have made annual gifts with recipients including clinical investigators at MD Anderson, the Cleveland Clinic. and the University of Minnesota.  Both wines have been consistent award winners:I am proud and pleased with all of my wines, including those not yet entered in competition. The 2012 and 2013 Zinpiphany and #2red are the current go-to wines on our dinner table.",4.0,1,"5 Campaigns

<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>Almost four years ago, my wife Heather and I started <strong>Brush Naked</strong>. I was in a hotel room in Edmonton and was brushing my teeth after breakfast. Once I finished brushing my teeth, I threw the toothbrush out. The garbage can was empty and plastic, so once the toothbrush hit the bottom of the can it bounced, almost like it was slow motion. All I could think about was what a waste it was. <strong>Brush Naked</strong> was born.</p>
<p>At <strong>Brush Naked</strong> we offer <strong>bamboo</strong> handle toothbrushes with recyclable/compostable packaging. We've learned a lot in the last four years and the one thing we're sure of <strong>bamboo</strong> is a wonder plant!</p>
<p><strong>Bamboo</strong> is naturally anti-microbial and anti-bacterial. It requires no irrigation or pesticides. Unlike a tree, you can cut down <strong>bamboo</strong> and it will completely regenerate in less than four years! This makes <strong>bamboo</strong> perfect for ... STRAWS!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1542170648/th5mvq4qga8zo3aoqrrd.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>Introducing Sip Naked</h3>
<p>Our mission at <strong>Sip Naked</strong> is to eliminate single-use plastic straws. We're going to do that by offering <strong>bamboo</strong> straws. Stainless steel, silicone and compostable plastic straws just aren't as environmentally-friendly, especially when you consider the processes used to make them! And who wants cold steel in their mouth? Unfortunately, compostable plastic straws won't break down without proper disposal. There are too many that end up in our oceans where the conditions don't exist to break down compostable plastic.</p>
<p><strong>Bamboo straws are where it's at! </strong>A <strong>bamboo</strong> straw can be used for at least a month. It's ideal for hot and cold drinks because<strong> bamboo</strong> is temperature resistant. No inks or dyes are used. <strong>Bamboo</strong> straws are ideal for warm, hot and icy cold drinks such as water, coffee, soda, shakes and smoothies. A <strong>bamboo</strong> straw can even go in the dishwasher!</p>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>While we have secured funds to cover most of our start-up costs for <strong>Sip Naked</strong>, the money raised by this campaign will help us equip and stock <strong>Sip Naked </strong>while minimizing our reliance on loans. We are aiming to raise <strong>at least $15,000</strong> with this crowdfunding campaign. While our hope is to exceed this goal, your contributions will be put towards initial inventory and package design even if we don't meet our campaign goal.</p>
<p>Examples of our Start-Up requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>initial inventory</li>
<li>package design</li>
<li>website design</li>
<li>computer equipment</li>
<li>workbenches/tables for shipping</li>
<li>shelving</li>
</ul>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>To get you excited to help eliminate single-use plastic straws, we've teamed up with some of our favorite companies to offer some pretty sweet rewards. You'll receive perks like Brush Naked toothbrushes, Sola Skincare Coconut Deodorant, Bathorium, Stone Field Shave shaving kits, Plenty + Spare Lip Balm, gift certificates from Belgard Kitchen, Craft Beer Market, Havana Vancouver and Verdura Salads, or a 7 night stay oceanfront in Maui.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>By supporting <strong>Sip Naked</strong>, you'll be helping to eliminate single-use plastic straws. Every single day in North America, hundreds of millions of straws are thrown out. Yes, plastic straws can technically be recycled, but most straws are too light to even make it through the sorter. Most straws end up in the landfill, where they take thousands of years to break down. The rest eventually find their way into our oceans. Did you know that single-use plastic straws are among the top ten items found during shoreline clean ups (toothbrushes are in the top ten as well)?</p>
<p>Once in the oceans, plastics pollute the water and kill marine life. Over 70% of seabirds and 30% of turtles have plastics in their stomachs. Marine life that ingest plastic have a 50% mortality rate. Plastics that stay in the oceans for long periods of time eventually get broken down into smaller pieces called microplastics. These microplastics are consumed by fish and then make their way up the food chain.</p>

<p>Six years ago in a small town in Spain, an idea was born, to promote veganism in Logroño. Our little idea soon gained strength and became our goal.</p>
<p>In 2013 this adventure began with a bean burger, five years later we are a 100% vegan restaurant, with more than 9 types of vegan burgers, sandwiches, tapas and a variety of desserts, all handmade with organic and local produce.</p>
<p>Since then, the importance of green, sustainable, and a environmentally friendly way of living has gained mass appeal. This motivated us take our dream further. Everything had to be in harmony with what our heart dictated.</p>
<p>We hired renewable energy sources, we started using organic napkins, we changed our packaging in a way that respects the environment and we started using ecological cleaning products.</p>
<p>Currently our restaurant doesn’t quite reflect our spirit, or way of thinking.</p>
<p>We need to update our image and renovate and improve our premises in order to be wheelchair friendly and create an amazing experience for our customers and staff.</p>
<p>With this campaign we intend to raise sufficient funds to make the following improvements: change the restaurant and kitchen layout , update the plumbing and electricity installations, comply with current regulations on soundproofing, access for the disabled, and renovate the façade.  We also would like to upgrade the kitchen for the current demand, investing in machinery and utensils that facilitate our work.</p>
<p>Create a franchiseable and sustainable business model to expand not only our business but also our dream.</p>
<p>In this country there are 260,000 establishments, one bar for every 175 people, and the highest density in the world. More than in the entire United States. It is necessary to carry out this change, generate less waste, be respectful with the environment, support local trade and base our diet on a vegan or vegetarian diet.</p>
<p>It is clear that a few restaurants are not going to make a big difference, but they are going to show other entrepreneurs that there is another way of doing things and that it can be done better, that it is viable and of course the business is still profitable. That is the ultimate goal of all business.</p>

We will be producing fine spirits made in the classic British tradition using imported grains, botanicals and classic recipes.Our StoryRoyal Foundry Craft Spirits founders Nikki and Andy McLain are a husband and wife team who have partnered with friend and former coworker Kelly Everhart. American-born Andy lived in Europe for much of his childhood with his British parents, and still has close family and friends across the pond. His love of Scotch has led him to fulfill his dream of running a distillery. CEO Kelly has a wealth of experience in the military and corporate sector as a lawyer and  small business owner, and CMO Nikki has a background in both marketing and advertising. ​Why Invest in Spirits?Because Craft is king! According to Fortune Magazine, the movement has just begun: “Forget Craft Beer, Craft Liquor is the Next Big Thing,” Fortune Magazine 10/2016.Where craft beer was 10 years ago, the “premiumization” trend has been the main driver behind growth in the distilleries industry over the past five years.

<h3>Who We Are </h3>
<p>Qué Tal will be the Twin Cities first authentic Salvadorian food truck. You can explore unique eats that offer fresh new flavors while supporting our community-driven focus. We plan to partner with local organizations in providing free meals as well as cultural and food education experiences.  Qué Tal is more than just a food truck, it is a commitment to share Salvadorian culture, traditions, and stories, and to be apart of building a strong community.</p>
<p><strong>Great Food</strong></p>
<p>Qué Tal will provide new dishes and a combination of flavors that will awaken the foodie in all of us. Our food is made in small batches and locally sourced when possible. Our unique authentic flavor comes from family recipes that have been passed down from generation to generation. El Salvador's national dish and what takes center stage in our menu are the pupusas. They are made fresh and to order by the hands of a pupusera, a craftswoman skilled at making the perfect pupusa. Most importantly our food is made with love and from people that love to make it.  </p>
<p><strong>Our Menu  </strong></p>

<p><strong>Rich Culture</strong></p>
<p>Our food at Qué Tal reflects Salvadorian culture: vibrant, rich in flavor, depth, warmth and perhaps most importantly, inviting. We will share our delicious food with customers, our extended family, and create a cultural experience that begins with our openness and invitation that we hope leaves you walking away with new found knowledge, respect, and admiration for what El Salvador offers. We are looking forward to sharing our food, history, music, art, and traditions to create a space in which both, our customer's, bellies and hearts are full.</p>
<p><strong>Strong Community</strong></p>
<p>As a collectivist culture, Salvadorian values are founded in community and so is Qué Tal. We believe that what sets us apart from other food trucks, and other food establishments in the Twin Cities, is our commitment to building strong communities. As progressive and thriving as our cities are, we face many racial and socioeconomic disparities. Many members of our communities are underrepresented and underserved. As an immigrant, Latina, and woman entrepreneur, our founder, Nancy Alayon, is determined to make Qué Tal a true community partner. Qué Tal will provide meals, along with food and cultural education classes to cultural centers, low-income schools, and organizations committed to the same work. </p>

<h2><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></h2>
<p>We have a unique offering since there are no other Salvadorian food trucks on the market however with any new business, there are risks. There are a number of established food trucks in the Twin Cities as well as a booming restaurant scene but we know that we have something special.  </p>
<p>Qué Tal is owned and operated by Nancy Alayon. Nancy's experience spans four years of high-paced restaurant experience, ten plus years of sales experience, five years of leadership and management experience and three years of non-profit and community work. Her work experience is matched by her skills in the kitchen, yet nothing could match her love of food and the desire to share it with her community.</p>
<p>To ensure the success of Qué Tal, we have been able to leverage our communities to explore and foresee the challenges and complexities of owning a food truck. In reviewing our business plan with successful entrepreneurs, discussing the complexities of running a small business with small business owners, networking with other restaurateurs, aligning with the communities we aspire to partner with, and asking people to try the food – a lot – we know we have the right people, mentors and business plan in place to minimize the risks involved with opening a small business.</p>
<p>We feel good about the authenticity of our food, the groundwork, and our business model that we will overcome any challenges we may face.</p>

<h3>about me and nutty life</h3>
<p>I started nutty life 2 years ago after passionately making nut milk for myself for a few years.  I was sick and tired of buying store-bought nut milks filled with cancer-causing carrageenan &amp; various gums known to cause bowel issues in lab rats.  So, I decided to make my own nut milk that was additive free and naturally sweetened with dates.</p>
<p>I have been making our cashew milks on a small scale for the past 2 years -- blending everything by hand in 2-quart blenders.  We currently run 4 blenders at a time &amp; are in the kitchen for 16+ hours on production days.  We are in about 35 Boston-area stores and hoping to expand throughout New England in the coming months.  As we expand into new stores, we will not be able to keep up with demand with our current production process, so we need your help to purchase a 60-quart floor blender.  Every dollar helps us get closer to our goal!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>what we need &amp; what you get</h3>

about me and nutty life
I started nutty life 2 years ago after passionately making nut milk for myself for a few years.  I was sick and tired of buying store-bought nut milks filled with cancer-causing carrageenan & various gums known to cause bowel issues in lab rats.  So, I decided to make my own nut milk that was additive free and naturally sweetened with dates.
I have been making our cashew milks on a small scale for the past 2 years -- blending everything by hand in 2-quart blenders.  We currently run 4 blenders at a time & are in the kitchen for 16+ hours on production days.  We are in about 35 Boston-area stores and hoping to expand throughout New England in the coming months.  As we expand into new stores, we will not be able to keep up with demand with our current production process, so we need your help to purchase a 60-quart floor blender.  Every dollar helps us get closer to our goal!

what we need & what you get
We are purchasing a used 60-quart floor blender (originally ~$20k) for $5500.  We have already put $500 down & need your help with the remaining $5000.  Even if we don't reach our full goal, every single dollar will go towards purchasing this blender.

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">OUR STORY</h2>
<p>We are creating an in-house brewery called Whippetlabbet Brygginkubator (Translation: Whippet Lab's Brew Incubator) inside Whippet Lab Restaurant and Beer Lounge. We are located in a neighborhood called Skanstull on the island of Södermalm -- the hipster capital of Stockholm and also, coincidentally, the craft beer epicenter. The Brew Incubator will allow brewers traditionally underrepresented in the brewing community to brew using professional 200L equipment and develop their own brewing identity. The goal is to foster talented people who couldn't otherwise start their own brewery to develop their brewing skills, get creative, and build their own brand. What's great is that all Brew Incubator members and guest brewers will get to have their beer on tap at Whippet Lab's bar! This will give brewers access to a dedicated audience of beer connaiseurs eager and ready to drink it.</p>
<p> </p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">WHO ARE WE?</h2>
<p>Stina Nygårds (Brewer), who for many years has brewed beer at home in her three great aunts' farmhouse kitchen in Dalarna, and VS Brodie (Whippet Lab owner and chef), who for 20 years has been a chef in Paris, and Jami Weinstein (Whippet Lab owner and tap curator), a professor with a background in Philosophy &amp; History of Science and Technology dreamed up the idea to establish a small brewery in Stockholm that could diversify the newly exploding Swedish brewing community.</p>
<p>With your support, we can foster a whole crop of new brewers, spark interesting collaborations, and what's more: make the brewing process visible to the Swedish public - who can learn about the process behind the beers they are drinking. In Stockholm it is rare to have an in-house brewery!</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">SOCIAL JUSTICE AND BREWING</h2>
<p>Whippet Lab, aside from being a restaurant and bar, is also what we call ""a Social Club for the resistance."" The Social Justice Club is our way of turning the tradition of elite, members-only, private social clubs on its head. While Whippet Lab is open to everyone, like those old boys’ clubs Whippet Lab also has a membership (which gives members a discount at the restaurant) and co-hosts events and benefits with local and international organizations dedicated to fighting for social justice. These can include, for example, organizations fighting against racism, homophobia, sexism, classism, climate change, or who support animal rescue, the arts, literature, economic equality, immigration, education, feminism, and refugees.</p>
<p>The concept of the Brew Incubator is an extension of our social justice work, and is based on an inclusive politics. We want use our brewery as way to open up and diversify the brewing world by providing a real, live brewery where those people who wouldn't ordinarily have access to the brewing world could get the opportunity to brew.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">CHALLENGES</h2>
<p>Originally we had hoped to be able to launch the brewery at the same time as Whippet Lab opened in late July 2017. But everything takes longer than you think it will and costs more than you expect. VS and Jami, two Americans, started the restaurant/bar Whippet Lab and they faced endless surprises and challenges in the process. However, through dedication and hard work, it is now up and running. And with its amazing food, unparalleled tap list of a dozen rotating Nordic and Baltic microbrews, and inclusive atmosphere, it has become a highly rated and much appreciated alternative among the Södermalm restaurants/bars.

<p>And now, with your help, an in-house brewery is on its way! Our brewing background is in small-scale home brewing, so it will be a challenge to engineer a brewery at a significantly larger scale and to calibrate recipes so that they work at that scale as well. However, a functioning space for the brewery is already in place and we also have our first fermenter and the required permits in hand. So, we are ready to go as soon as the rest of the equipment is purchased and installed!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">OTHER WAYS TO HELP</h2>
<p>If you wish to help but cannot afford to make a donation, there are still ways! First, you can share this page with everyone and anyone you know who could be interested in contributing. There's also the possibility to donate used equipment, if you have some equipment you want to unload. And then, there are more practical hands-on possibilities. For example, we would appreciate help with setting up the brewery, carrying heavy stuff, teaching at Whippet Lab Brew Incubator's brew school, and all things technical and building related. If you're handy, we could very much use your help!</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The Next Chapter In The Dining Experience</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Let me keep this real simple...</p>
<p><a href=""http://surprisemekitchen.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">SURPRISE ME KITCHEN</a> is a ""no-menu"" concept where our chefs imagine, create, prepare and deliver wonderfully packaged gourmet meals safely to the comfort of your home.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1599608212/n9mus2cb0a5thmw2gavb.png"" src=""""/></p>
<h3> </h3>
<p>Let me explain...</p>
<p><strong>We don't have menus here!</strong> </p>
<p>In fact, we don't want them because we believe it's time to reinstate freedom in the dining experience both for our guests and our chefs. I'm well-positioned to know this, having worked in this industry for 25 years in a variety of establishments ranging from casual, upper casual to prestigious five-star fine dining restaurants in Beverly Hills, CA. </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Genesis Of The Concept</h3>
<p>One night in a restaurant where I used to work in Beverly Hills, two of my guests were struggling, trying to figure out what to order for dinner even though I had already answered all of their questions in great detail. The situation was getting hopeless. I had to do something. So, I took the menus away and asked them 3 simple questions:</p>
<p>Do you have any food allergies? </p>
<p>Do you have any dietary restrictions? </p>
<p>What are you in the mood for today?</p>

<p>We get that. But here's the thing...</p>
<p>The dining experience as we know it will never be the same again.

<p>Our plan in the near future (when people are allowed to congregate again) is to organize pop-up Surprise Me Dinner events throughout the city in the most unexpected, most beautiful and attention-grabbing locations. Each event will have a unique theme, style and vibe in an elegant setting with exceptional service and unforgettable ambiance.

<p>The city of Los Angeles is our lab, where we are designing and perfecting the blueprint of our operation. When the time comes, we will take our Surprise Me Kitchen concept to other cities around the country - an initiative that aims to bring unknown talented chefs as well as celebrity and well-known industry masters into the spotlight and give them a platform to let their imagination soar without limits as they showcase their culinary skills to the benefit of all our guests.</p>

</div></div>","The Next Chapter In The Dining Experience
 
Let me keep this real simple...
SURPRISE ME KITCHEN is a ""no-menu"" concept where our chefs imagine, create, prepare and deliver wonderfully packaged gourmet meals safely to the comfort of your home.

 
Let me explain...
We don't have menus here! 
In fact, we don't want them because we believe it's time to reinstate freedom in the dining experience both for our guests and our chefs. I'm well-positioned to know this, having worked in this industry for 25 years in a variety of establishments ranging from casual, upper casual to prestigious five-star fine dining restaurants in Beverly Hills, CA. 
Genesis Of The Concept
One night in a restaurant where I used to work in Beverly Hills, two of my guests were struggling, trying to figure out what to order for dinner even though I had already answered all of their questions in great detail. The situation was getting hopeless. I had to do something. So, I took the menus away and asked them 3 simple questions:
Do you have any food allergies? 
Do you have any dietary restrictions? 
What are you in the mood for today?
And that was it. With their permission and the information they had provided from answering my 3 questions, the chef and I crafted a wonderful four-course surprise meal for them. I gave them a detailed description of every dish that landed in front of them. Their faces lit up with every course, not knowing what was coming next, just excited that something wonderful was coming. By surrendering their dining experience to us, something magical happened: excitement, anticipation, and happiness. I was just as satisfied with the experience as they were.

I repeated that same process with many more guests throughout the years, and every time, the result was the same: smiles all around as guests left impressed and happy with the unexpected turn their dinner had taken. Year after year, my ""no-menu"" concept was solidifying in my head as a potential powerful new business model. 
And just like that, Surprise Me Kitchen  was born.
How It Works
Though the main focus of our concept is on feeding our guests great food, our operation is heavily backed by the latest technologies.  

Guests would go to our website: www.surprisemekitchen.com, select a date, and whether they'd prefer ""Delivery"" or ""Pickup"". After that, they are prompted to select their food allergies, dietary restrictions and food preferences from a well designed pop-up screen. Once done, guests can click on ""Order catering"" for the review of their order, information and payment.
Et voila! With the information provided, our chefs will create, design and prepare a delicious four-course gourmet meal designed specifically for each individual guest. Meals are then delivered elegantly and safely by a well-dressed Butler in white gloves.

The rest will face <strong>unemployment rates 30% higher</strong> than the general public. At Revival Chili, we believe in second chances. By starting a food truck, we will provide our employees with job training, personal mentoring, and hands-on experience. By teaching them skills in entrepreneurship on the truck, we hope to give our employees the tools necessary to go on to start their own businesses.</p><p><strong>It is with YOUR HELP that we hope to achieve our mission.</strong></p><p>Our primary goal is to teach our employees to become leaders that can go on to create or lead sustainable businesses. We will provide first-hand experience managing a business, positively interacting with consumers, and the ins and outs of purchasing. We hope to change the negative connotations associated with ex-convicts and build a more inclusive entrepreneurial ecosystem, while staying environmentally conscientious with every business decision. <strong>Our goal is to positively impact the careers of over 100 previously incarcerated citizens by 2025.</strong></p><p>We believe we can touch 100 lives because of the cascade effect within our business. We will do everything in our power to help our employees go on to start their own food trucks, while encouraging them to hire reentering citizens.

For individuals interested in a food service job, such as working or owning a food truck, this inability to get initial experience is debilitating to their career paths.</p><p>So, one of Revival Chili’s cornerstone values is to <strong>pay a livable wage </strong>to our employees.

That is why we are focused on professional development and putting our employees experience, skills, and development at the forefront of every business decision.</p><p>At Revival Chili, we believe passionate people should be allowed to pursue the career of their choice, <strong>regardless of past discretions</strong>. Inline with our mission, a startup in New York is achieving something similar with employment and training in the food truck industry. This truck is called <strong>Drive Change in NYC</strong>, founded by entrepreneur <strong>Jordyn Lexton</strong>. With Jordyn as a mentor, Revival Chili has been able to create a more thought out, robust business plan.

Plus, by setting up at pop-up events over the last 4 months, we have acquired the majority of small equipment needed for the truck (besides large kitchen items). Now, all we need is the actual truck, or in this case, that food trailer to be towed behind the CEO’s pick-up! Here’s what the breakdown looks like:</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1487529903/jxd5uv4qa3j2njiiorki.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1487528038/n60hhaktxofobjqldkwi.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Any resources collected will be extremely useful to ensure Revival Chili can sustain full-time employment for our employees and continuing operation of the trailer.</p><p>_____________________________________________________________________________</p><h2 style=""text-align: center;"">What are some of the risks and challenges?</h2><p>_____________________________________________________________________________</p><p>There are obvious risks in every startup business, especially the food industry. Revival Chili is minimizing these risks through the partnerships we have created in the city of Pittsburgh. Currently, we have a main partner, <strong>Zero Six Eight.</strong> Zero Six Eight is an incubator for previous incarcerated individuals that want to start their own business or people that would like to hire ex-offenders. They help us by finding employees, providing administrative support, and community development training for Revival Chili. We plan to use this partnership to create a supportive and continuously growing community of chili lovers!</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1487976600/difvb5oft21rjbgxgx7c.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Revival has also received recognition and support from other organizations in the city that try to break down barriers to employment.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>""I'm thrilled to see Revival Chili pushing forward!

Luckily, the food truck is just starting to blossom so we are entering at the right time.

Inline with our mission, a startup in New York is achieving something similar with employment and training in the food truck industry. This truck is called Drive Change in NYC, founded by entrepreneur Jordyn Lexton. With Jordyn as a mentor, Revival Chili has been able to create a more thought out, robust business plan. We hope to stand out with our dedication to teaching entrepreneurial skills and providing valuable experience for our employees (and deliver some spicy chili).Another company doing something similar is called Hot Chicken Takeover in Columbus. Part of their mission is:HCT’s about more than just chicken. It’s about our people. Beyond an amazing community of customers, HCT provides supportive jobs to men and women who need a fair chance at work. Be it homelessness, previous incarceration, or another barrier to employment, HCT employees are wildly ambitious and have set their sights on what’s next.They have seen great success in Columbus. After operating out of a shared space, HCT is already opening up a storefront. You can see their progress at the website below.http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/busines..._____________________________________________________________________________What do we need?_____________________________________________________________________________The Revival Chili entity is already set up along with the bank account, payroll, accountant, insurance, and lawyer. Plus, by setting up at pop-up events over the last 4 months, we have acquired the majority of small equipment needed for the truck (besides large kitchen items). Now, all we need is the actual truck, or in this case, that food trailer to be towed behind the CEO’s pick-up! Here’s what the breakdown looks like:Any resources collected will be extremely useful to ensure Revival Chili can sustain full-time employment for our employees and continuing operation of the trailer._____________________________________________________________________________What are some of the risks and challenges?_____________________________________________________________________________There are obvious risks in every startup business, especially the food industry. Revival Chili is minimizing these risks through the partnerships we have created in the city of Pittsburgh. Currently, we have a main partner, Zero Six Eight. Zero Six Eight is an incubator for previous incarcerated individuals that want to start their own business or people that would like to hire ex-offenders. They help us by finding employees, providing administrative support, and community development training for Revival Chili. We plan to use this partnership to create a supportive and continuously growing community of chili lovers!Revival has also received recognition and support from other organizations in the city that try to break down barriers to employment.""I'm thrilled to see Revival Chili pushing forward! Jordan Robarge is providing an incredible opportunity for ex-offenders to get in on the ground floor of a small business. At Community Kitchen Pittsburgh, we know how tough it can be to get a good job when you have a record. We are proud and grateful to have CKP graduates on the Revival Chili team!"" - Tom Samilson, Director of Programs, Community Kitchen PittsburghAnother challenge is ensuring we can grab a share of the food truck market here in Pittsburgh. Luckily, the food truck is just starting to blossom so we are entering at the right time. Also, there are no chili-inspired food trucks in the city which is slightly baffling because who doesn’t love chili?! It also makes it easier when you serve the best chili anyone has ever seen._____________________________________________________________________________What are the perks?_____________________________________________________________________________Take a look at our amazing menu and let us know what you'd like to order! Don't worry, the prizes aren't as spicy as the chili (unless it is chili, of course :D)._____________________________________________________________________________Who is Revival Chili team?_____________________________________________________________________________Jordan graduated from the University of Virginia in 2015 with a Systems Engineering degree and was thrilled to enter the fourth class of Venture for America (VFA) Fellows immediately after college. The summer after graduation, while on his way to Pittsburgh, Jordan started catering family members and friend's events with his world-renowned chili. In Pittsburgh, he worked for an early-stage incubator, Thrill Mill, that also ran an Innovation & Music Festival, Thrival. Jordan helped grow Thrival by creating an Ambassador program with 20 Ambassadors at 8 different colleges. He also developed an Andriod and iOS application for the Festival in 2016. Through the connections he made while at Thrill Mill, Jordan was able to turn his chili-cooking hobby into a social enterprise supporting local farms, renewable energy and re-entering citizens. Jordan hopes to be able to provide healthy, delicious chili to everyone in Pittsburgh, especially incoming VFA Fellows. Thanks to everyone who has read our story.

<h3>About Us</h3>
<p>My name is Alexandra Barroso and I'm the owner of restaurant Tuga. <br/>For already two years I've been living in Sofia, Bulgaria. <br/>Cooking has always been my passion and I was also missing a lot Portuguese cuisine so a year ago I left my corporate job to try to bring a little bit of Portugal to the city!</p>
<p>I started organizing transportation of Portuguese products to Bulgaria (there are almost no<br/>Portuguese products here) and I rented a small bar&amp;diner. Unfortunately, the kitchen<br/>there was too small and it didn't allow much for cooking.</p>
<p>So four months ago I rented a restaurant with a bigger kitchen and opened the restaurant<br/>two months ago. Now we are a small team of four people and we need your contribution in order to have the restaurant operating.</p>

<p>The money we raise here will be used to have the restaurant operating during these<br/>very difficult first six months after opening a restaurant. It will take an extra €15,000+ to have it operating until the end of the year that we cannot afford.</p>
<p>By contributing and getting one of our perks you actually prepay your dinner at the restaurant and you can come any time until the end of the year to get your dinner offer. It's like buying a voucher for clothes that is valid for a given period!</p>
<p>You can also get one of our branded T-shirts or a special edition of the Portuguese scarf from the last year's European football cup that Portugal won!</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>

</h3><p>Our names are Juan and Charlie. We are cousins, Boulder locals, CU graduates and the creators of Green Belly’s Guatemalan foods and experiences. We believe in cross cultural exchanges of flavors that bridge foods with love, traditions, and ethical partnerships.</p><p>Green Belly Foods started when Juan shared his mother’s delicious hot sauce with his friends. They were blown away by the unique cilantro, garlic and habanero blend. The sauce was so fresh and tasty that Juan began getting bombarded with requests for more of the delicious green hot sauce. Eventually they convinced him to enter the local farmer’s market in 2015. Once he opened up a tent, sales took off and the Green Belly revolution began!</p><h3><strong>Our Humble Beginnings</strong></h3><p>When we opened our first tent in 2015, we were so new to large scale production that we could hardly keep up with demand. We had other full-time jobs to juggle, family and kids, but the constant demand for Green Belly showed us we were onto something special.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1493325000/j4mif8kzewtaebedtuj3.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>The craving for Green Belly has been overwhelming! At farmers markets people tell us they can’t get enough. We receive orders online from all over the country, and have even shipped to Europe!

Our names are Juan and Charlie. We are cousins, Boulder locals, CU graduates and the creators of Green Belly’s Guatemalan foods and experiences. We believe in cross cultural exchanges of flavors that bridge foods with love, traditions, and ethical partnerships.Green Belly Foods started when Juan shared his mother’s delicious hot sauce with his friends. They were blown away by the unique cilantro, garlic and habanero blend. The sauce was so fresh and tasty that Juan began getting bombarded with requests for more of the delicious green hot sauce. Eventually they convinced him to enter the local farmer’s market in 2015. Once he opened up a tent, sales took off and the Green Belly revolution began!Our Humble BeginningsWhen we opened our first tent in 2015, we were so new to large scale production that we could hardly keep up with demand. We had other full-time jobs to juggle, family and kids, but the constant demand for Green Belly showed us we were onto something special.The craving for Green Belly has been overwhelming! At farmers markets people tell us they can’t get enough. We receive orders online from all over the country, and have even shipped to Europe! People from all walks of life have shared their stories about how our sauces have changed their diet and brought new explosion of flavor into their daily meals.It's been three years of hard work and constant determination to keep this growing. The most important contributions we've received have been the continuous love and support from our customers who crave our sauces. We would like to thank everyone who has helped us along the way!Customers have further supported us by helping us enter and grow in local retail stores and restaurants such as Alfalfa's, Lucky’s Market, The Village Coffee Shop and Peppercorn who picked us up right after our first summer.Green Belly Hot SauceThe success of Green Belly is our unique recipe that focuses on flavor.

Treat colds and coughs

<p>We have approached banks with our idea and business plan, in which majority have expressed their excitement in our idea. Many of the banks we have approached however require us to have at least a 20% deposit going towards the down payment of our project.</p>
<p>We understand the risk and challenges involved in starting a brand new business, especially when it comes to raising funds. Some of the risks and challenges includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Business failing (the obvious one)</li>
<li>Not getting enough food truck owners to buy in with idea</li>
<li>The community not showing up to Le Rodeo</li>
<li>Renovation taking longer than expected</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Here are some of the ways we have and will continue to ensure these risks and challenges are minimized:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There is always a risk for any business to fail, however, we are striving to ensure that this does not happen to Le Rodeo by building a good team for our brand. The team currently consists of myself and my beautiful fiancé Tolu. Although a Registered Nurse by profession, Tolu has a business background. She is originally from London, UK. Prior to relocating to the RDU area in 2016, she had her own startup events and catering business in the UK, in which she exceeded in. She previously also assisted in successfully launching an African-Caribbean restaurant in the UK. Tolu has been a huge part of the Le Rodeo journey, as she has not only been as passionate and dedicated to the vision as I am, she has also been my check and balance, bringing in a different perspective to the bigger picture.</li>
<li>For the past 8 months, I have been meeting with 2 mentors that were assigned to me through the SCORE program. The SCORE program is a non-profit association that provides entrepreneurs business mentoring services from the early stage of an idea to the launch of the business.</li>
<li>My marketing background, as well as Tolu’s (my fiancé) charming British ascent has been a huge advantage throughout the process of entrepreneurship so far. Over the last few months, we have conducted market research with food truck owners at several rodeos in the Raleigh-Durham area, asking them what are some of the challenges for their mobile business.

<li>In regards to the community not showing up to Le Rodeo, we have conducted a random sample market research with members of our RDU community to ask them specific questions that has given us the confidence in our community's backing in pursuing this venture.

<li>Since 2017, we have been working with a turn key building company called ‘Bobbit Design Build’ to develop our unique concept. They have been in business for over 65 years. We have built a trusting relationship with them by meeting on a regular basis to discuss build out, site maps, and ways to be innovative, whilst remaining within budget.

</ul>
<p>With these risks and challenges being important to consider, we just need people to gather around us, believe in our vision, and give us a chance so that we can bring this amazing idea, in which we believe in to our Raleigh-Durham community.</p>

</div></div>","We've all heard of Food trucks, we've all heard of Food halls... Put them together and Voila!! You have LE RODEO! The first Food Truck Hall of its kind, giving you the best flavors of the Triangle!
Keep Scrolling to Learn More! :-)
 


Imagine your favorite Food Truck is no where to be found :-O
Imagine it started raining, but you've already made plans to go to a Rodeo with your friends, and you don't want to get your hair wet standing in line :-|
Or imagine you're at home, your favorite Food Truck is nearby, and you didn't even know it :'(
Nightmare right?
 

 
Le Rodeo is the first Indoor/Outdoor Food Truck Hall, Market, Bar, and Gathering Place of its kind. We are creating a hub for Local and Inter-State Food Trucks to serve the local community and their customers (our guests) authentic burst of flavors and the diversity they provide. 
To raise $100,000 from generous individuals and businesses who believe in our vision, which are: 

Building Community
Building Culture

Bringing Convenience  

Although we require way more than we are asking for, the $100,000 fund raised will go towards our building project, initial startup cost, marketing, and most importantly the equity required to secure the remaining balance through a bank loan.
 

 
 

 
To Provide a rotation of 3 Breakfast, 3 Lunch, 3 Dinner, and Desert trucks every day of the week,
To Create Opportunity for Food Trucks to connect and build relationships with the community
Le Rodeo’s customers will be spoilt with options for a quick stop on their way to work, chill night out with friends/family, or an intimate celebration with loved ones without the hassle of waiting outside in line in harsh weather conditions.
That’s right, our customers can visit each Food Truck access port from the inside! Think of it this way, the foodies are on the inside, the Food Trucks are on the outside.
 


Cousins Maine Lobster
Konopizza
Rare Earth Farms

 

AKA the 'Power Couple'

 

This crowdfunding campaign is important to us and the future of Le Rodeo because we have been unable to secure a few properties that would have been perfect for our vision, due to the lack of funds. To show our appreciation to all those who build Le Rodeo with us through their generous contributions, we have some exciting perks to give in return!

We have approached banks with our idea and business plan, in which majority have expressed their excitement in our idea. Many of the banks we have approached however require us to have at least a 20% deposit going towards the down payment of our project.
We understand the risk and challenges involved in starting a brand new business, especially when it comes to raising funds. Some of the risks and challenges includes:

Business failing (the obvious one)
Not getting enough food truck owners to buy in with idea
The community not showing up to Le Rodeo
Renovation taking longer than expected

Here are some of the ways we have and will continue to ensure these risks and challenges are minimized:

There is always a risk for any business to fail, however, we are striving to ensure that this does not happen to Le Rodeo by building a good team for our brand. The team currently consists of myself and my beautiful fiancé Tolu. Although a Registered Nurse by profession, Tolu has a business background. She is originally from London, UK. Prior to relocating to the RDU area in 2016, she had her own startup events and catering business in the UK, in which she exceeded in. She previously also assisted in successfully launching an African-Caribbean restaurant in the UK. Tolu has been a huge part of the Le Rodeo journey, as she has not only been as passionate and dedicated to the vision as I am, she has also been my check and balance, bringing in a different perspective to the bigger picture.
For the past 8 months, I have been meeting with 2 mentors that were assigned to me through the SCORE program. The SCORE program is a non-profit association that provides entrepreneurs business mentoring services from the early stage of an idea to the launch of the business.
My marketing background, as well as Tolu’s (my fiancé) charming British ascent has been a huge advantage throughout the process of entrepreneurship so far.

Le Rodeo is perfect for resolving these, as we have a central location for food truck owners and food lovers to meet every single day of the week.

Furthermore, the likelihood of no one turning up at Le Rodeo is very slim, considering the fact that RDU is known to be the place for food lovers.

At the core of BOHEMiYUM...there’s a deep passion not only for popcorn but also for the ARTS.
I come from a very CREATIVE upbringing...my mother has always had a love for drawing and painting, and my father’s a musician. My parents were ARTISTIC, but they were pretty ""HIPPIE"" as well...and part of that lifestyle was living and eating in a nutrition-conscious way. One of our favorite snacks was popcorn...and we had some very CREATIVELY INSPIRED ways of flavoring it. Through the years, it’s remained my snack of choice, and I’ve continued to make and share this DELICIOUS POPCORN with friends and family time and time again. 





Definition of the Arts:A group of activities done by people with skill and imagination. Music, film, theater, dance, painting, sculpture, literature, etc...
Did you know ?……
Studies have shown that students who are exposed to education in the Arts, (especially at a young age)...benefit from improved motor skills, improved language skills, and improved social skills? 
Did you know ?……
When kids learn to play a musical instrument, it creates new connections between the hemispheres of the brain, which in turn, supports long-lasting improvements in listening and communication skills?
Unfortunately...there is a grim reality in how fragile these programs are in schools across the US. Sadly enough, funding for the Arts programs is usually one of the first things that get affected in public school spending. 
Coupled with the crippling effects of the pandemic and the newly implemented “distance learning”, these are unprecedented and unusual times for public schools and their already delicate education programs...especially in the Arts department.
BOHEMiYUM is on a mission. With every bag sold, a portion of proceeds goes to help keep these programs alive. 

With your help, we can get this delicious popcorn into the market, onto store shelves, into your hands...AND, be able to be part of something bigger than us...something that can make a real difference in people’s lives.
We've worked tirelessly to get the company to where it's at right now.

<p>Our team wants to bring a truly <i>unique </i>experience in the form of a first-ever interactive-design cafe, <strong><a href=""http://qcafeseattle.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Q Cafe</a></strong>, to Seattle. Fused with the desire to bring high-quality coffee and fresh baking products, we want our customers to engage with the interior of the cafe - be it through the revelation of its secret doors or the lever mechanism that takes your order directly from the espresso bar on the first floor to the mezzanine.

</b></p><h1><b>Short Summary</b></h1>
<p>Hello,       </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1438531019/mc3b2mdtqzowoltx1lxk.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 600.2277904328018px;height: 425px;""/></p><br/><p><br/></p>
<p>  My
family and I are trying to start an ice cream company that everyone can enjoy,
even those with food allergies. The thought of Goo-Goo and Alice’s Ice cream
came when my youngest daughter was diagnosed with several allergies which would
limit our going out to eat and the food choices at home. The name was developed
by her older sister and herself.  Our
family really enjoys ice cream but is very hard to get Ice cream she can eat
without the risk.</p>
<p>  Goo-Goo
&amp; Alice’s Ice Cream was created for children, adults and families who
suffer from food allergies.  We
understand what a inconvenience it is to have to go through the stress and
research of a product that is peanut and tree nut free and other allergens as
well. There are so many ice cream manufactures out there.  However, none of their products are produced
in a facility that is dedicated to producing a product that is 100% free of
specific allergens. </p>
<p>  We
want your family to be able to enjoy the traditional American way of having ice
cream. Worry free.. We are in the process of expanding our flavors from the 4
most popular, but want to be 100% certain our product meets gourmet quality and
most importantly 100% allergy friendly. So enjoy a scoop of our delicious ice
cream the way it should be, worry free.</p><p><br/></p><p>

<h3>
<b>Carefu</b><b>l <span>Production And  Quality Packaging <b>Will Help Us Provide A Quality Product</b></span></b>
</h3></b><p><b></b></p>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Lets break it down folks in more
detail:</span>
</div>
<p><b>Low Temp Kneading Freezer</b></p>
<p>Low temperature ice cream undergoes a
cold kneading creating a finely structured ice cream with a smoother, creamier
taste. </p>
<p><b>Hardening Tunnels</b></p>
<p>Hardening enables fast freezing,
which achieves the desired ice cream texture by limiting the growth of ice
crystals and air bubbles.</p>
<p><b>Homogenizers</b></p>
<p> uncompromising food safety.</p>
<p><b>Mix units </b></p>
<p>mix preparation requirements of small
to medium capacity ice cream producers. Units are equipped with all the
components you need for the preparation of ice cream mix and are ready for
immediate production.</p><p></p><h3><b>These are parts of the production lines.</b></h3><p><b></b></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1438038981/iwgtmyo38bwtzwbv7ma2.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/><p><b>Large storage freezers</b></p>
<p>To store finished products , we could
also lease a large refrigerated 40 ft trailer and keep it at bay for storage if
needed.</p>
<p><b>Pallet Jack</b></p>
<p>To move finish product pallets and or
materials</p>
<p><b>Tool Crib</b></p>
<p>Tools used in switching molds and
reassembling components after sanitizing and repair.</p>
<p><b>Office equipment</b></p>
<p><b>Delivery truck</b></p><p><b>Website   </b></p><p><b></b></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1438039161/voh0x7eddelbj6d3cosv.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<p>  As
stated before this is not a turn key operation, but a start up company. So many
components are needed and are not listed simply because there is too much to
list. We have set our based goal based on need and if exceeded, we will be able to purchase production equipment on a larger scale.</p><p>
</p><h2>The Impact</h2>
<p>Did you know? </p>
<p>  Somewhere
around 150 to 200 people die in the U.S. each year becauseof food allergies. It's estimated
that around 50 percent to 62 percent of 
those fatal cases of anaphylaxis were caused by peanut allergies. </p>
<p>All food allergies are  a very real problem with a potentially fatal
reaction. Someone who suffers from a peanut allergy reaction requires immediate
medical attention. There are not many nut free ice creams factories and
resources are limited to those with a peanut and tree nut allergies. With
limited resources we miss out on one of Americas past-times favorites, going
out for ice cream. There are very few 
products available in our area without concern of contamination , Sure
we can go down the street to the local creamery and get a ice cream, however
the scoop is used on pistaccio and maple walnut and they use nuts as topping. I feel as most do when our allergy concerns are presented, they are simply in such a rush to handle it 100% . Our  daughters came up with the idea of  Goo-Goo &amp; 
Alices Ice Cream. We never go out for Ice cream and have been making it
at home now for some time. As a parent I would like to help them with this
project and as a entrepuneur I would love to go on this adventure, but also help
others  in doing so.  Providing a safe
product for families is our goal.  There is a lot of potential in this industry
when you consider those who are in need than those who just want. We simply
just want everyone to enjoy...</p>
<p>Many products have a  may contain warning sometimes
known as (advisory labelling) and are used by food companies where there is a risk
of cross contamination during the production process. Advisory labelling is
widespread and causes immense frustration to shoppers. It is helpful that all
prepackaged food sold include direct statements. For those who have allergies, you might  find the label misleading or not as direct as it should be.  Our goal is to eliminate the confusion. Our
Product will always have a peanut ,tree nut and gluten- free label along with
a statement stating none of these products have ever been used or introduced
into our facilities.</p><p>
</p><h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2>
<p>Many companies have risks and challenges before them. Our challenge is Getting volumes of product out there for the consumer. Instead of using small machines to create small batches of ice cream, we want to use large ones, so we can distribute through out the country. We are choosing to setup our company near New Englands heart of transportation so we can access all the way down the east coast and across New York. Marketing and distribution is going to play a large part in the success  of GOO-GOO &amp; Alice , but with key personnel in these key position this should come a lot easier than anticipated. These are not the only challenges that we will be taking on. We know how high the demand is for this product. We need to be FDA approved and be able to brand our product allergy safe. ( some companies are stating they are treenut free. These companies use Coconut, according to the FDA Coconut is a treenut  don't be mislead. My daughter is allergic to Coconut as well.) If our goal isn't reach we are still moving forward with this project. If our goal is exceeded than we have larger plans for Goo-Goo &amp; Alice. We would love to open a ice cream shop at headquarters and several throughout the country. Let us enjoy the fun of going out for it.</p>

<p>Discussing our product ideas would help immensely. This will help the campaign and success of Goo-Goo and Alices Ice Cream. We believe in paying it forward, and Goo-Goo and Alices Ice Cream wants to give back if we are successful. We plan on donating some of our proceeds to the following charities.</p><p><b>The Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America<br/></b></p><p><b>Neurofibromatosis, Northeast</b><br/></p><p><b><b>American </b><b>Kidney </b><b>Fund</b><br/></b></p><p><b>American Diabetes Association</b></p><p><b><b></b></b></p><h1><b><b><br/></b></b></h1><b><b>

</b><p>Startup on the funding has been slow. But hopefully it will
begin gaining speed. Thank you for those who have contributed so far. For those
who cannot provide a financial contribution, we could use your help by
spreading the word about our kick-starter. This would help out a lot.  Several people have asked, why is our goal is
so high? Our response is simple; we want to be able to purchase the equipment
and personnel to get our product distributed across the country. What if you
don't reach the goal? The goal can be less, however this means slower turn
around on product and limited distribution. If our is reached at least half way
we can still get Goo Goo &amp; Alice up and running. It will just take some

<br/>
</div></div>","Short Summary
Hello,       
  My
family and I are trying to start an ice cream company that everyone can enjoy,
even those with food allergies. The thought of Goo-Goo and Alice’s Ice cream
came when my youngest daughter was diagnosed with several allergies which would
limit our going out to eat and the food choices at home. The name was developed
by her older sister and herself.  Our
family really enjoys ice cream but is very hard to get Ice cream she can eat
without the risk.
  Goo-Goo
& Alice’s Ice Cream was created for children, adults and families who
suffer from food allergies.  We
understand what a inconvenience it is to have to go through the stress and
research of a product that is peanut and tree nut free and other allergens as
well. There are so many ice cream manufactures out there.  However, none of their products are produced
in a facility that is dedicated to producing a product that is 100% free of
specific allergens. 
  We
want your family to be able to enjoy the traditional American way of having ice
cream. Worry free.. We are in the process of expanding our flavors from the 4
most popular, but want to be 100% certain our product meets gourmet quality and
most importantly 100% allergy friendly. So enjoy a scoop of our delicious ice
cream the way it should be, worry free.
What We Need & What You Get..


Careful Production And  Quality Packaging Will Help Us Provide A Quality Product

Lets break it down folks in more
detail:

Low Temp Kneading Freezer
Low temperature ice cream undergoes a
cold kneading creating a finely structured ice cream with a smoother, creamier
taste. 
Hardening Tunnels
Hardening enables fast freezing,
which achieves the desired ice cream texture by limiting the growth of ice
crystals and air bubbles.
Homogenizers
 uncompromising food safety.
Mix units 
mix preparation requirements of small
to medium capacity ice cream producers. Units are equipped with all the
components you need for the preparation of ice cream mix and are ready for
immediate production.These are parts of the production lines.Large storage freezers
To store finished products , we could
also lease a large refrigerated 40 ft trailer and keep it at bay for storage if
needed.
Pallet Jack
To move finish product pallets and or
materials
Tool Crib
Tools used in switching molds and
reassembling components after sanitizing and repair.
Office equipment
Delivery truckWebsite   
  As
stated before this is not a turn key operation, but a start up company. So many
components are needed and are not listed simply because there is too much to
list. We have set our based goal based on need and if exceeded, we will be able to purchase production equipment on a larger scale.
The Impact
Did you know? 
  Somewhere
around 150 to 200 people die in the U.S. each year becauseof food allergies. It's estimated
that around 50 percent to 62 percent of 
those fatal cases of anaphylaxis were caused by peanut allergies. 
All food allergies are  a very real problem with a potentially fatal
reaction. Someone who suffers from a peanut allergy reaction requires immediate
medical attention. There are not many nut free ice creams factories and
resources are limited to those with a peanut and tree nut allergies. With
limited resources we miss out on one of Americas past-times favorites, going
out for ice cream. There are very few 
products available in our area without concern of contamination , Sure
we can go down the street to the local creamery and get a ice cream, however
the scoop is used on pistaccio and maple walnut and they use nuts as topping. I feel as most do when our allergy concerns are presented, they are simply in such a rush to handle it 100% . Our  daughters came up with the idea of  Goo-Goo & 
Alices Ice Cream. We never go out for Ice cream and have been making it
at home now for some time. As a parent I would like to help them with this
project and as a entrepuneur I would love to go on this adventure, but also help
others  in doing so.  Providing a safe
product for families is our goal.  There is a lot of potential in this industry
when you consider those who are in need than those who just want. We simply
just want everyone to enjoy...
Many products have a  may contain warning sometimes
known as (advisory labelling) and are used by food companies where there is a risk
of cross contamination during the production process. Advisory labelling is
widespread and causes immense frustration to shoppers. It is helpful that all
prepackaged food sold include direct statements. For those who have allergies, you might  find the label misleading or not as direct as it should be.  Our goal is to eliminate the confusion. Our
Product will always have a peanut ,tree nut and gluten- free label along with
a statement stating none of these products have ever been used or introduced
into our facilities.
Risks & Challenges
Many companies have risks and challenges before them. Our challenge is Getting volumes of product out there for the consumer. Instead of using small machines to create small batches of ice cream, we want to use large ones, so we can distribute through out the country. We are choosing to setup our company near New Englands heart of transportation so we can access all the way down the east coast and across New York. Marketing and distribution is going to play a large part in the success  of GOO-GOO & Alice , but with key personnel in these key position this should come a lot easier than anticipated. These are not the only challenges that we will be taking on. We know how high the demand is for this product. We need to be FDA approved and be able to brand our product allergy safe. ( some companies are stating they are treenut free. These companies use Coconut, according to the FDA Coconut is a treenut  don't be mislead. My daughter is allergic to Coconut as well.) If our goal isn't reach we are still moving forward with this project. If our goal is exceeded than we have larger plans for Goo-Goo & Alice. We would love to open a ice cream shop at headquarters and several throughout the country. Let us enjoy the fun of going out for it.
Other Ways You Can Help</a>
Discussing our product ideas would help immensely. This will help the campaign and success of Goo-Goo and Alices Ice Cream. We believe in paying it forward, and Goo-Goo and Alices Ice Cream wants to give back if we are successful. We plan on donating some of our proceeds to the following charities.The Asthma and Allergy Foundation of AmericaNeurofibromatosis, NortheastAmerican Kidney FundAmerican Diabetes Association




Here are images of our perks....T-Shirt -$50 DonationTumbler $25 DonationUPDATE:

Startup on the funding has been slow. But hopefully it will
begin gaining speed. Thank you for those who have contributed so far. For those
who cannot provide a financial contribution, we could use your help by
spreading the word about our kick-starter. This would help out a lot.  Several people have asked, why is our goal is
so high? Our response is simple; we want to be able to purchase the equipment
and personnel to get our product distributed across the country. What if you
don't reach the goal? The goal can be less, however this means slower turn
around on product and limited distribution. If our is reached at least half way
we can still get Goo Goo & Alice up and running. It will just take some
time for us to be able reach out to everyone.",7.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Since age 11, Renee struggled with extreme bouts of depression, fatigue, and anxiety. After 20 years and without any relief from these issues, she decided to make a change. She refused prescription drugs and started down a path in search of a natural remedy. Renee found her answer in her food and began eating a plant based, raw diet. The unprocessed vitamins and nutrients from this diet helped Renee's body to heal itself. Her depression, fatigue, and anxiety completely disappeared. She became such a passionate believer in the raw food culture that she took the next step to completely immerse herself in the lifestyle. She became a certified raw food chef and started to create her own recipes. </p><p>Most of us have a sweet tooth - raw foodists are no different. After deciding to eat raw, that doesn't change. Renee's favorite treat to get her fix was always chocolate, thus Renee's Raw Chocolate was born.

<p>According to the World Health Organization (WHO) more than 350 million people suffer from depression world wide. Additionally, in 2008 WHO reported that more than one third of people around the globe aged 20+ are considered overweight or obese.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are Channing &amp; Stephanie Doss and over the past several years we have dreamed of opening our own local business, but we were handcuffed by our careers in corporate America. We decided we weren't going to allow a CEO who didn't even know our names to dictate the way we lived our lives, but rather that we owed it to our three beautiful daughters to build a business of our own that would accomplish three things: 1) Create a legacy for our children and their children; 2) Be an integral  part of the community and city it serves; 3) Provide a snack that everyone could enjoy without excluding those with food allergies/sensitivities or diet restrictions. With those goals as the foundation, we have created Popculture. A gourmet popcorn shop located in the heart of America in our hometown of Parkville, Mo. Popculture is a mix of old fashioned handmade popcorn made fresh daily on site paired with a modern focus on providing an organic and non-gmo popcorn seed in 60+ flavors handcrafted from scratch with  vegan, dye free and food allergy/sensitive offerings. Available in our store and online with nationwide shipping we strive to show all of our customers how passionate we are about popcorn!</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
We are Channing & Stephanie Doss and over the past several years we have dreamed of opening our own local business, but we were handcuffed by our careers in corporate America. We decided we weren't going to allow a CEO who didn't even know our names to dictate the way we lived our lives, but rather that we owed it to our three beautiful daughters to build a business of our own that would accomplish three things: 1) Create a legacy for our children and their children; 2) Be an integral  part of the community and city it serves; 3) Provide a snack that everyone could enjoy without excluding those with food allergies/sensitivities or diet restrictions. With those goals as the foundation, we have created Popculture. A gourmet popcorn shop located in the heart of America in our hometown of Parkville, Mo. Popculture is a mix of old fashioned handmade popcorn made fresh daily on site paired with a modern focus on providing an organic and non-gmo popcorn seed in 60+ flavors handcrafted from scratch with  vegan, dye free and food allergy/sensitive offerings. Available in our store and online with nationwide shipping we strive to show all of our customers how passionate we are about popcorn!

What We Need & What You Get
We have the recipes, the passion and the space. Your generous investment will help us buy a 20 gallon commercial caramelizer,  2 cooling/sifting tables and outdoor commercial signage. $7,706.00 is the cost associated with the 20 gallon caramelizer and cooling table & the remaining $4,500.00 will be allocated for our commercial signage. Additionally, Indiegogo charges an 8% fee for using this crowdfunding platform.


Now on to the important stuff! We are extremely humbled and grateful for your consideration of Popculture as a business you would like to invest in. For your important contribution, we have come up with a list of amazing giving options, all of which feature our yummy POPCORN starting at just $5.00!!! Should your reward come with an awesome Popculture T-shirt, you can pick from the following sizes (S/M/L/XL/XXL/XXXL).

We have the skill set and the ambition to operate a successful business, and with your help we will have an amazing new piece of equipment and awesome store signage to really propel our business from startup to success story.
We can't express the amount of gratitude we have for the people in our community and through social media that have stepped up to support, encourage and help us through this process. It really is amazing, the power of people helping people make their dreams a reality. 

Risks & Challenges
It's possible that the store can be delayed due to construction, but we have been assured by the property manager & contractor that everything is on track for construction to be completed by beginning - mid July.
Other than the lead times and construction - with your help and generousity Popculture will be open and serving the public by Aug 15, 2017!!!. As of this post going live - WE ARE UNDER CONSTRUCTION!!!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>A little about us:</p>
<p>Pre-meadery days we were gardeners, birders, kayakers, cavers, cooks, and brewers. We love finding things from a garden that we can include in a brew. We LOVE to brew. If you know anyone who does brew you might have noticed their brewing setup fermenting away in their living room, basement or garage. It is with that same passion that we decided that we wanted to make this our life's work.</p>
<p>We love mead and we want others to love mead, too. In case you don't know what mead is: it is an alcoholic beverage made by fermenting the sugars out of honey (much the same way you would with grains for beer or apple juice for hard cider). So...We started a meadery. We won five medals (3 gold, a silver and a bronze) and got in over 90 stores across Massachusetts (and into 31 states through VinoShipper)! Yayay!</p>
<p><u><strong>Here's Where We Are Now and How We Can Use Your Help to Get to the Next Level:</strong></u></p>
<p>Now we have a new space. It has a tasting room. It needs a counter &amp; a retail system. It also needs work. In addition, we need to upgrade a few things in our work room in order to help us increase capacity (gosh it would be swell to be able to fill more than a bottle at a time!) and bring you and our distributor MORE MEAD! $17,300 will get us there.</p>
<p>If you *really* like  our perks &amp; we exceed our goal then maybe we can do more...</p>
<p>Please join us for this journey. Make a contribution, share the link with friends, read our updates, get excited with us, come to the tasting room when it's done, get a tour of the space and find out what else we have done!!</p>
<p>When will our perks be available? Our anticipated end date is early 2018. Get a perk for yourself and get one for a friend as a gift. These perks are the gifts that keep on giving, especially our year-long mead clubs.</p>
<p>Interested in helping but not finding a perk that blows your skirt up? You can still contribute (any amount) by clicking on the ""back it"" button on the top right side of the page. And sharing our campaign link (<a href=""https://igg.me/at/housebearbrewing"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://igg.me/at/housebearbrewing</a>) to your friends, relatives, cohorts, dotdotdot, is also helpful.  Thanks for supporting craft!</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>Perfect Serve is the UK's new premium bottled cocktail brand. Independently owned, we specialise in creating small batches of unique, high-quality classic cocktails – delivered to your home.</p>
<p>We never compromise on the quality of the ingredients. Our cocktails are hand blended and we only use the highest quality spirits. Wherever possible we like to use Fair Trade products, giving Perfect Serve cocktails a superior taste and a natural wholesome flavour – so much better than using artificial flavourings.</p>
<p>Perfect Serve cocktails have their own visual and taste twist, so each one is unique and Instagram worthy. We aim to deliver the same quality of cocktail that you would stumble upon in the world’s most famous bars.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What We Need</strong></p>
<p>We are looking to raise £24,000 this round which will enable us to do the following: </p>
<ul>
<li>£8000 will cover our rent for one year in commercial premises that we have sourced. We need commercial premises to sell and distribute alcohol. Having this space will allow us to increase production, implement an intensive quality control process and give us the chance to experiment on further recipes. The premises we have identified are already within the catering industry and currently hold a 5* Food Hygiene Certificate which is ideal for us.</li>
<li>£2000 will be used for licensing applications and insurance.</li>
<li>£12,000 will be used for a social marketing campaign in order for us to raise awareness of the brand among our target audience. Our product is highly Instagrammable and we want to use this to our advantage as much as possible. </li>
<li>£2000 will be used to purchase ingredients so that we can maintain a large stock of our cocktails. </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What has happened so far? </strong></p>
<p>We have sent samples to tasters and have received very positive feedback. We have also showcased our product at an exhibition in Chelsea where our cocktails were very well received by the guests and local restaurants.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What gaps do we fill? </strong></p>
<p>Cocktails being delivered to homes around the UK is on the rise and is sure grow massively over the next few years, but currently it is a boom. We anticipate a strong demand for premium bottled cocktail products as measures are currently introduced within the pandemic with no foreseeable end in sight. Unfortunately, restaurants, bars and hotels are taking a massive hit in terms of losing staff, which will have a knock-on effect and potentially reduced the quality of products served. However, it is important for them to keep their standards up high. Our product allows for these areas to keep thriving. Furthermore, customers at home can safely enjoy cocktails where they may not have the knowledge, equipment or ingredients to create such cocktails. Restaurants and hotels can use our product to serve guests quickly and efficiently, as the cocktails are designed to have minimal experience needed but still maintain a high-quality product. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are looking to expand our offerings to include mail order and shipping of our Glatt Kosher BBQ to your doorstep. In order to do this, we will need to add a second pit to increase production, as well as purchase additional items needed for shipping such as freezer packs, styrofoam coolers, and a commercial-grade cryovac sealer and bags.</p>
<p>As this is a passion project, fueled by my desire to raise funds for charities I support, and not a full-time retail operation, I could use your help raising the needed funds to expand the business. </p>
<p>It is out of this desire to make the BBQ more accessible, raising additional funds for the charities we support, that we are looking to expand. With your help, we can Repair The World One Bite at a Time.</p>

<p>Here's a breakdown for how the desired funds will be used:</p>

You'll always have a place that you can go to and say <strong>""Look, that's me up there"" </strong>and know that you helped finish the taproom that you're sitting in enjoying one of our out-of-this-world brews.</p><p>Pretty cool, eh?</p><p>No matter what you contribute <u>(even if you just share this page on Facebook)</u>, know that each one of our perks comes with something we can never give you enough of: <i><u><strong>Our Gratitude.</strong></u></i> </p><p>We are truly grateful to everyone who has helped us achieve this dream.  Even though we are primarily self-funded, these ventures take a lot more than money to be a success (although money is a big part of it, so please contribute!). </p><p>We could not have done this without the encouragement and helping hands from our friends and family, and we hope that you will be a part of that too. </p><h3>Why are we different and why should you help?</h3><p>If you're looking for ""another brewery"", we're not it. </p><p>There are too many breweries in Orlando to just open another one. </p><p>We saw what all the other breweries we're doing and decided to do things a bit different. </p><p>How?</p><p><u>First</u>, we're going to be the <strong>only brewery and homebrew shop in Orlando</strong>. Jeremy Pittman, the owner of Orlando Homebrew Supplies is also the one of the owners of Rockpit Brewing. </p><p>He's moving his shop from Curry Ford Rd into our new 5,000 SQ FT location at 10 W Illiana St, Orlando, FL when we open there in July.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,w_695/v1519264219/syw6lplytt5qxekdrvaj.jpg"" src=""""/> <br/>(This is Jeremy)</p><p>That means if you want to learn how to brew the beer you'll enjoy in our taproom, you can walk 10 steps to the shop and learn how to make it.</p><p><u>Second</u>... We're the only brewery in Orlando that has a <strong>theme based on one of the owners  unusually unique and weird family heritage</strong>. Brutal family feuds, mountain moonshine and West Virginia coal mining? Yeah... That's Jeremy's heritage. <u>(See the story below)</u> </p><p><u>Third</u>... We're building almost everything in the brewery by hand. We obviously can't do some of the work that specialists are needed for like plumbing and commercial electric. </p><p>But just about everything else... The bar, the half-walls, the tables are <u><strong>all going to be hand-crafted by us</strong></u>.

I also heard stories has a kid about some kind of family feud where people actually we're killed over a pig. </p><p>Wait, what?</p><p>Yeah... turns out, I'm a direct descendant of <strong>Anderson ""Preacher Anse"" Hatfield</strong>. Who's that?</p><p>Do you remember the show ""Hatfields and McCoys""? It was a <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1985443/awards?ref_=tt_awd"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">mini-series on the History channe</a>l that showed the brutal feud in the mountains of Kentucky and West Virginia between the Hatfield and McCoy families.</p><p><u><strong>That's the feud my family kept talking about as a kid.</strong></u> It was so brutal they actually created a whole mini-series about it. </p><p>Crazy, right?</p><p>My great, great, great, great, great grandfather Preacher Anse Hatfield was the local justice of the peace that presided over ""<a href=""https://hatfieldmccoycountrymuseum.com/preacher-anse-cabin"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Hog Trial</a>"" which essentially started the feud. </p><p>My grandfather, Homer Little (you'll see his picture in our brewery), spent his childhood in the mountains of West Virginia and Kentucky. </p><p>His favorite hobby? Making moonshine with this grandpa and dad. It's only natural that I love to brew beer with a history of moonshining in my blood. </p><p>After school, he spent a good chunk of his days as a young man working the coal mines for the Red Jacket Coal Company in West Virginia before they shut down in the 1950's. After they shut down, he left the mountains behind and moved to Orlando.</p><p>So to say my family history is deeply entrenched into the folklore of the Kentucky and West Virginia mountains is an understatement. </p><p><strong>When you look at our logo again, you'll see how we worked this history into it. </strong></p><h3>How we convinced two other people crazy enough to start a brewery with us. </h3><p>Even though I’m good at cranking out tasty beer and Chris is a wiz at marketing and technology, we knew after a few months there was no way that we could get this brewery up and running by ourselves. Not with our busy schedules. </p><p>We needed a rock star to help run this place. Someone who's ""been there, done that""</p><p>That's when Chris introduced me to the third member of the wolf-pack: <strong>Sean Burke</strong></p><p>Sean was (still is) a very good friend of Chris and local business consultant. </p><p>Whenever he's involved with a project, everything flows effortlessly and the business runs like a well-oiled machine. </p><p><strong>More important was something Sean said to Chris 10 years ago... </strong></p><p>Long before Chris was a craft beer consumer (circa 2007), Sean invited Chris to his house for an evening of education.</p><p>The subject? ""How to brew beer at home and stop drinking mass-marketed light beers""</p><p>Sean showed Chris how easy it was to brew 5 gallons of beer right on your stovetop (using extract) and how good the beer you make at home can be. </p><p>By the end of the night (and after a few homebrews), <u>Sean confessed to Chris that he wanted to someday open a brewery</u>.</p><p>He didn't know how or when, just that it was going to happen. </p><p><i><u>Well... Here we are 10 years later and he's opening a brewery with the same guy he first confessed his dream to. </u></i></p><p><i><strong>Weird how that works, eh?</strong></i></p><p>But there was still a missing piece.

</ul></div>","Here's how to get rewarded for helping us finish our taproomWe're not looking for a handout.Far from it.And we're not asking you to pick up a hammer or paint roller either. All we're asking you to do is contribute on this page.And for this for this, you'll get some limited edition perks, your first beer free when we open in July and public recognition in our brewery taproom (if you want it) that you can show off /brag to friends and family.Yep. You'll always have a place that you can go to and say ""Look, that's me up there"" and know that you helped finish the taproom that you're sitting in enjoying one of our out-of-this-world brews.Pretty cool, eh?No matter what you contribute (even if you just share this page on Facebook), know that each one of our perks comes with something we can never give you enough of: Our Gratitude. We are truly grateful to everyone who has helped us achieve this dream.  Even though we are primarily self-funded, these ventures take a lot more than money to be a success (although money is a big part of it, so please contribute!). We could not have done this without the encouragement and helping hands from our friends and family, and we hope that you will be a part of that too. Why are we different and why should you help?If you're looking for ""another brewery"", we're not it. There are too many breweries in Orlando to just open another one. We saw what all the other breweries we're doing and decided to do things a bit different. How?First, we're going to be the only brewery and homebrew shop in Orlando. Jeremy Pittman, the owner of Orlando Homebrew Supplies is also the one of the owners of Rockpit Brewing. He's moving his shop from Curry Ford Rd into our new 5,000 SQ FT location at 10 W Illiana St, Orlando, FL when we open there in July. (This is Jeremy)That means if you want to learn how to brew the beer you'll enjoy in our taproom, you can walk 10 steps to the shop and learn how to make it.Second... We're the only brewery in Orlando that has a theme based on one of the owners  unusually unique and weird family heritage. Brutal family feuds, mountain moonshine and West Virginia coal mining? Yeah... That's Jeremy's heritage. (See the story below) Third... We're building almost everything in the brewery by hand. We obviously can't do some of the work that specialists are needed for like plumbing and commercial electric. But just about everything else... The bar, the half-walls, the tables are all going to be hand-crafted by us. That means that you'll see stuff in our brewery you'll never find anywhere in the world. Four... We'll have both super weird AND run-of-the-mill offerings.Our specialty will be stretching the bounds of normal craft beer creations for our craft beer enthusiasts (that's you, right?) while also serving those who are just looking for a ""good beer"". This means we'll have all sorts of the weird stuff like ""Pineapple Milkshake New England Double IPA"", ""Jalapeno Cream Ale"", ""Horchata Ale"", ""Lime Gose with Gin soaked oak chips"", ""Carolina Reaper IPA"", ""Cucumber Brown Sugar Lager"" and well.. You get the idea...(Just one of our weird creations)... but we'll also have more mainstream options like Stouts, Porters, Pale Ales, IPA's, Cream Ales and even stuff the ""mass-marketed light beer lovers"" in your life will like. If you don't find something you like in our brewery, we'll walk next door to ABC and buy you a beer you do like. Finally... The reason we need your help. We're self-funded. We're four guys who came together and scraped up the funds to get started and then got a loan to help fund the project. However, opening a brewery comes with a hefty price tag.  Because we have done this all on our own (to this point) through our savings and a small business loan, we are left with a longer list of necessities than we have cash to support.  We hope that any of you that are passionate about beer and pushing the limits of what is available in your community will consider becoming a supporter of this special cause.  We are a brewery for the community with intention of being a platform for advocacy, fundraising (non-profit), collaboration and education.And for that, you'll get recognition and cool perks from our brewery. All you need to do is choose a perk and contribute. Easy enough, right?So go grab a perk now!Who is Rockpit Brewing and how did we get started?Hi there, I’m Jeremy Pittman. I own and operate Orlando Homebrew Supplies and am the President of Rockpit Brewing.The following is the tangled web of a story about how Rockpit Brewing came to life and how we're going to do everything we can to turn an old SODO warehouse into a craft beer haven. ------“You think I could add a brewery here?”My cousin, Chris Rock (no, not that one), looked around my shop for a second and something to the effect of…(This isn't Chris either)He was right. My building wasn’t big enough to add a brewery.In December 2015, I opened my small homebrew shop on the corner of Bumby Rd and Curry Ford Rd. I started Orlando Homebrew Supplies after deciding that I had enough of being an employee. I spent 8 long and stress-filled years as a commercial property appraiser over in Tampa.It’s not that I hated my job, I just had co-workers that led me to consume mass amounts of the beer I was homebrewing.Maybe you can relate...After those 8 years of horror, owning my shop has been nothing short of amazing. My customers are undeniably cool, they always bring me beer to sample and love hanging out at the shop with me.I now get to spend my days talking about beer, making beer and trying tons of amazing beer that my customers make.Even with all that, early in 2017, I felt like something was missing.You see… I originally put together a business plan to open a brewery and homebrew shop under one roof.After looking at the investment needed to open a brewery and the fact that I was going to be a one-man shop for a while, trying to run two completely different businesses just wasn’t in the cards at the time.That all changed when I ask Chris if he'd want to partner up with me and run the marketing for the brewery.He thought about it for a few seconds and “Oh heck yeah!”We looked at each and said:We knew that something special was brewing (pun intended).Yeah, but what does ""Rockpit"" mean?“What are you going to name the brewery?” Chris asked me.“No clue” I replied.For about 5 minutes we went through names.Sandcastle Brewing. Nope…Curry Ford Brewing. Nope…Eola Brewing. Nope…Flying Space Monkey Brewing…. WTF?? Nope!!!Then Chris jokingly said “Why don’t we call it Rockpit Brewing. Like our last names?”I sat there for a few seconds and said “You know what… That’s not bad at all”Chris replied “I was just kidding”I said “No… I think that might be it”.And like that, we officially had a name for our brewery and we were pretty proud of 5 minutes of work.(re-enactment of our actual chest bump)The weird and historic way we came up with the theme for our breweryI always heard crazy stories about my family history.I knew my mom and grandfather were from Kentucky. I also heard stories has a kid about some kind of family feud where people actually we're killed over a pig. Wait, what?Yeah... turns out, I'm a direct descendant of Anderson ""Preacher Anse"" Hatfield. Who's that?Do you remember the show ""Hatfields and McCoys""? It was a mini-series on the History channel that showed the brutal feud in the mountains of Kentucky and West Virginia between the Hatfield and McCoy families.That's the feud my family kept talking about as a kid. It was so brutal they actually created a whole mini-series about it. Crazy, right?My great, great, great, great, great grandfather Preacher Anse Hatfield was the local justice of the peace that presided over ""The Hog Trial"" which essentially started the feud. My grandfather, Homer Little (you'll see his picture in our brewery), spent his childhood in the mountains of West Virginia and Kentucky. His favorite hobby? Making moonshine with this grandpa and dad. It's only natural that I love to brew beer with a history of moonshining in my blood. After school, he spent a good chunk of his days as a young man working the coal mines for the Red Jacket Coal Company in West Virginia before they shut down in the 1950's. After they shut down, he left the mountains behind and moved to Orlando.So to say my family history is deeply entrenched into the folklore of the Kentucky and West Virginia mountains is an understatement. When you look at our logo again, you'll see how we worked this history into it. How we convinced two other people crazy enough to start a brewery with us. Even though I’m good at cranking out tasty beer and Chris is a wiz at marketing and technology, we knew after a few months there was no way that we could get this brewery up and running by ourselves. Not with our busy schedules. We needed a rock star to help run this place. Someone who's ""been there, done that""That's when Chris introduced me to the third member of the wolf-pack: Sean BurkeSean was (still is) a very good friend of Chris and local business consultant. Whenever he's involved with a project, everything flows effortlessly and the business runs like a well-oiled machine. More important was something Sean said to Chris 10 years ago... Long before Chris was a craft beer consumer (circa 2007), Sean invited Chris to his house for an evening of education.The subject? ""How to brew beer at home and stop drinking mass-marketed light beers""Sean showed Chris how easy it was to brew 5 gallons of beer right on your stovetop (using extract) and how good the beer you make at home can be. By the end of the night (and after a few homebrews), Sean confessed to Chris that he wanted to someday open a brewery.He didn't know how or when, just that it was going to happen. Well... Here we are 10 years later and he's opening a brewery with the same guy he first confessed his dream to. Weird how that works, eh?But there was still a missing piece. One that could only be filled by a very persistent customer and good friend of mine who kept offering his services if I ever decided to open a brewery.He had a particular set of skills. Skills that would useful for someone building a brewery (he's an Engineer!) His name? Ed Clark.(not an actual pic of Ed, but he did keep calling me like this)With the core group of guys in place and the permission of all our wives, Rockpit Brewing was officially formed as an LLC and we set out on this crazy journey of bringing a kick-ass brewery to life.(Jeremy Pittman, Chris Rock, our AWESOME landlord Tony, Sean Burke and Ed Clarke in front of our building we're revitalizing)The answer to those questions are ""SODO District near the corner of Michigan and Orange"", ""5000 SQ FT"" and ""July 2018""We get the following questions quite a bit when we're at brewfests or talking to people about the brewery:
When are you opening?
How big is your new place?
Where are you located?
Here's the answers...After a few failed attempts to secure a building, we finally lucked into a building near the corner of Michigan and Orange Ave in the SODO district in Orlando. We're right behind Cecil's BBQ on Orange Ave.It’s a huge, 5000 SQ FT warehouse (that's at least three times as big as the old building, Zoolander) that will host my homebrew shop, a taproom and brewery all under one roof.Here are the latest plans.Our projected open date is July 2018 which means we’re only a few months away from bringing you the concept I only dreamed about a few years ago.It’s going to be a place where you can sit and relax with friends and enjoy some of the most delectable and anomalous (that means strange) beers you’ll ever have.Our head-brewer Danny Diaz is a beer making genius. The recipes he comes up with are out of this world. Believe me... When you try the beers that Danny makes, you're going to have one of those ""Holy crap this is good"" moments. We hope to see you when we open July 2018! Perks, Explained...Flat Swag Pack...This is pretty much everything we could think of that would fit in an envelope and probably make it to your address with a single stamp.  Fingers crossed!Sticker ->        Coaster ->   16 oz. Pint Glass...Seems kind of redundant and obvious, right?  16 ounces = 1 pint, and it is made out of glass.  The cool thing is that we won't ever make them like this again, so it is bound to be worth something at some point.  To someone.  Somewhere.  Maybe?  Just kidding - you better take care of this little gem, it will serve you well in the future! T-Shirt (*** You'll be emailed for size, style and color after donating ***)This was a common garb worn by the ""cool people"" in the 20th and 21st centuries on planet Earth.  At least that is how we think it will be described in the future after enlightened people have decided that clothing is irrelevant - since all anyone cares about is beer.These t-shirts will include a never-to-be-printed-again ""Launch Crew"" inscription that will let us know you were here for us before we opened. And that comes with perks that you'll only know about when you wear the t-shirt into the brewery. Printed by our friends LR Printing in Orange City, FL (https://www.lr-printing.com/)Mens Next Level 60/40 Blend.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><strong>Art Is An Ale Brewing</strong> is a Franco/American couple brewing American style craft beer with French ingredients. We are starting a brewery in the medieval city of Amboise, France. Our brewery will be 2 hours from Paris and one block from the Chateau d'Amboise, historic home to the royal families and final resting place of Leonardo da Vinci. We will brew beer on site and host people in our taproom. We will distribute beer throughout France to specialty shops, hotels, &amp; restaurants. We are excited to combine American beer styles, like the West Coast IPA as well as, brewing innovations from the US with the high-quality local ingredients. Art Is An Ale Brewing will use filtering, bright tank carbonation, and bottling technology to distribute bottled craft beer that tastes like it does on draft.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><strong>WE NEED...</strong> to raise <strong>30,000 EUR</strong> to buy a bottle filler to distribute in France. The micro carbonated bottle filler we will purchase will preserve the clarity and quality of our beer, making it unique to the French market and amazing to drink at home!  Our beer in a bottle will taste like beer on draft.</p>The process of carbonating using 2nd fermentation is the predominant process in France for bottling beer. However, it may have an impact on flavor and quality consistency. As explained in the videos below, the 2nd fermentation can sometimes give an off flavor, created by yeast, masking some of the subtleties we work so hard to achieve in craft beer. The flavor of the beer can vary depending on temperature conditions during storage and length of time between when it is bottled and consumed.

<h3>What YOU Get:</h3>
<p><strong><i>Who doesn't prefer a beer on tap?!</i></strong></p>
<p>Of course, we are thrilled that people will be able to enjoy our beer in a bottle, but the experience of beer on draft is unique. Also, the community that develops in a taproom is one of our top priorities. We will be able to accommodate groups, have events, and do regular tours of the brewing process (a.k.a brew days!) We want people to, not only come and drink a beer but, really experience our process and be a part of it.</p>
<p>As for when you cannot make it to our taproom, Art Is An Ale's beer will taste like you are in the taproom when you open a bottle at home or anywhere our beers can be found. The micro carbonated bottle filler will allow us to ensure that your beer tastes awesome every time!</p>
<p><strong>Perks</strong></p>
<p>We will be offering a range of items and experiences for donating towards our campaign. Everything from stickers to a private brew session are up for grabs. Check them out!</p>
<h3><strong>What happens if we don’t meet our goal?</strong></h3>
<p>You will still get your perks, rest assured! We will likely reduce the overall capacity of the brewhouse and still purchase the bottle filler in order to ensure quality. Less beer, but higher quality beer.  We want to make as much of this tasty stuff as we can for you and it will be important to our overall financial strategy (i.e. make sure we stay in business) to make a certain quantity of beer. So, let’s make it happen!</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>By contributing to our campaign, you will help continue to spread beer culture and community to a larger audience. Taprooms and many popular American beer styles like the West Coast IPA, Gose, Farmhouse Ale, and Brett to name a few are not super common in France. We want to bring some variety, collaborate, and contribute to the beer community. Also, given that our project is located in a town highly visited by tourist, we hope that we can be a destination for beer drinkers from other countries looking to vacation in France. Our taproom experience will hopefully be one of many rich memories for visitors to our town, as well, a location for local people to enjoy a community experience. The successful distribution of our bottled beer throughout France will facilitate the overall financial stability necessary for our project to exist as a whole. Besides, we want you to be able to drink our beer whenever you want!</p>

<h3>Petit Résumé</h3>
<h3> </h3>
<p><strong>Art Is An Ale Brewing</strong> est une brasserie créée par un couple franco – américain d’un genre nouveau.</p>
<p>Nous avons la vocation de brasser des bières artisanales de style américain en utilisant des matières premières françaises.  Au printemps 2019, nous ouvrirons notre brasserie artisanale à Amboise : une ville médiévale située à seulement 2 heures de Paris. Nos locaux se tiendront  à moins de 100 mètres du mythique château de la Renaissance, résidence royale exceptionnelle et dernière demeure de Léonard de Vinci.</p> <p>Nos bières seront brassées et embouteillées sur place. Egalement, nous pourrons vous accueillir dans notre bar à dégustation afin d’y savourer nos productions.  Nos bières seront principalement distribuées en France : en boutiques spécialisées ainsi que dans certains bars, hôtels et restaurants.</p> <p>Notre vocation est de proposer des bières aux styles américains (comme des West Coast IPA) tout en utilisant des matières premières Françaises de haute qualité.  En effet, chez Art Is An Ale Brewing, nous filtrerons nos brassins et carbonaterons la bière en cuves de garde. Cette technique de mise en bouteille bien particulière (importée d’Amérique du Nord) permet de conserver les mêmes saveurs et arômes que dans les bières en pression.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1541438008/y6wur8skmzm679oaryg9.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>A propos de nous…</strong></p>
<p>Mattieu est Français.  Après ses études, il s’est expatrié à Los Angeles, pour poursuivre une carrière dans l’aéronautique en tant qu’ingénieur commercial.  Durant plus de 10 ans et en occupant différents postes (Vice-Président des ventes, Responsable des équipes et campagnes de ventes, etc.), Mattieu s’est vu confier des responsabilités sur des projets représentant plus de 250 millions de dollars.</p> <p>En novembre 2008, alors qu’il résidait en Californie, il est devenu un brasseur passionné. Depuis cette date, il a régulièrement produit ses brassins.</p>
<p>En observant l’évolution du marché de la bière artisanale aux Etats-Unis et en capitalisant sur son expérience professionnelle, Mattieu se lança le défi de créer sa propre brasserie artisanale. Il est donc revenu dans son pays natal pour se consacrer à son rêve et se donner pleinement les moyens de l’atteindre..</p> <p>Durant son séjour aux Etats-Unis, Mattieu a rencontré Katie : sa future femme. Katie est une artiste, designer graphique indépendante. Elle a notamment travaillé pour de grandes entreprises.</p> <p>Ensemble, nous associons nos talents et notre créativité pour construire une entreprise qui mettra la bière artisanale à l’honneur et qui répondre aux exigences de la communauté des passionnés de bière.</p>
<h3>Nos besoins et vos récompenses</h3>
<p><strong>Nous avons besoin de 30 000 euros pour acheter une embouteilleuse isobarométrique.</strong></p>
<p>Cette machine permettra de mettre en place un procédé de fabrication de bière novateur en France. Grâce à elle, nous obtiendrons une bière limpide dont la la qualité se conservera davantage.. En somme, nos bières bouteilles dégustées à la maison seront tout aussi excellentes que nos bières pressions !</p>
<p>Aujourd’hui, sur le marché français de la bière artisanale, la méthode prédominante consiste à re-fermenter la bière mise en bouteille. Ce procédé a souvent un effet néfaste sur la saveur et la qualité du produit. En effet, des « faux-goûts » proviennent de la levure et masquent de subtiles saveurs pourtant recherchées par les brasseurs artisanaux. L’optimisation des saveurs d’une bière peut varier en fonction de la température et de la durée de conservation.  Pour plus d’information, n’hésitez pas à regarder notre série de vidéos.</p>

<p> </p>
</div>
<p><strong>Vos compensations</strong></p> <p><i>Qui préfère la bière pression ?   Evidemment, nous tous ! </i>Nous sommes ravis de vous faire découvrir nos bières en bouteilles ayant la même saveur que nos bières en pression.  De plus, nous avons à cœur de créer une communauté d’amateurs de bières qui se retrouveront dans notre bar à dégustation.  Nous serons en mesure de recevoir de grands groupes, organiser des évènements et vous faire visiter notre espace de production lors des différentes étapes du brassage.  Nous souhaitons que les gens viennent autant pour savourer notre bière que pour être témoins de notre savoir-faire et de la qualité de nos produits.</p>
<p>L’embouteilleuse isobarométrique va nous permettre de développer un gout authentique dans chacune de nos bouteilles. Ainsi, chez vous comme n’importe où ailleurs, vous retrouverez l’authenticité et la qualité de la bière Art is An Ale de notre bar à dégustations.</p> <p><strong>Vos récompenses :</strong></p>
<p>Si vous faites un don à notre campagne, nous vous proposons un large choix d’articles et d’expériences uniques.  Cela peut aller du simple sticker à une séance de brassage VIP. Vous avez l’embarras du choix : allez les découvrir !</p>
<h3>Que se passe-t-il si on n’atteint pas notre but ?</h3>
<p>Pas de problème : vous recevrez vos articles quoi qu’il arrive ?</p>
<p>A ce compte-là, nous réduirons le nombre ou la taille de nos fermenteurs et minimiserons le coût d’achat de notre salle de brassage. Ceci aura pour effet de réduire notre capacite de production mais n’impactera en rien la qualité de nos produits.  Nous faisons ainsi le choix d’amoindrir la quantité plutôt que d’abaisser la qualité.</p>
<p>Cependant, conserver notre capacité de production est stratégique pour notre brasserie : elle est un élément clef de notre équilibre financier. Il est donc important de pouvoir atteindre notre but pour cette campagne et de ne pas renoncer à nos quantités prévisionnelles. Bref, on compte sur vous !</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1541435878/hte935njykwoh16uec2k.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>L’impact</h3>
<p>En contribuant à notre campagne, vous aiderez la culture bière artisanale à se populariser et à trouver sa place dans notre communauté .  Un bar à degustation et des styles de bière comme des West Coast IPA , Gose, Farmhouse, Brett et beaucoup d’autres encore ne sont pas populaires en France, c’est pourquoi nous voulons amener de la diversité, collaborer avec des brasseurs français et étrangers afin de faire partie de la communauté brassicole.  De plus, comme notre projet se situe dans un lieu très touristique, nous espérons devenir une destination pour les amateurs étrangers de bières artisanales en visite en France. On pense que l’expérience de notre bar à dégustation restera un très bon souvenir pour les nombreuses personnes qui visitent notre ville et bien sûr aussi pour les amboisiens . Ce sera un lieu de rassemblement et de bien être.  La distribution de nos bières en bouteille en France est un élément clé de notre stabilité financière et elle nous permettra d’exister sur le marché. En outre, Nous souhaiterions que vous puissiez boire nos bières ou que vous soyez !</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1541436717/rtmdsmwjjjkcvtnogvgg.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>Risques et challenges</h3>
<p><i><strong>Mais n’y a-t-il déjà pas suffisamment de bières en France et en Europe ? </strong></i> Peut-être…  MAIS, nos produits ont des caractéristiques différentes de celles de nos concurrents.  Nous surveillons le marché et, stratégiquement, nous développons des recettes inédites. Nous avons également à cœur de supporter l’économie locale en achetant des produits de proximité.</p>
<p>De façon générale, le marché français pour nos bières a le vent en poupe. Il s’accroît plus rapidement que le marché de la bière industrielle.  C’est donc MAINTENANT qu’il nous faut lancer notre projet !</p>
<p>Les préférences culturelles et les tendances gustatives du marché français font parties de nos priorités majeures. Notre enjeu est bien de savoir adapter nos recettes au goût de notre clientèle. Pour être ainsi à l’écoute des désirs de nos clients, nous avons déjà organisé des séances de dégustation pour mieux affiner nos recettes.</p>
<p>Notre bar de dégustation est l’opportunité d’être en contact immédiat avec les consommateurs de notre bière. Cela permettra d’échanger en direct sur la qualité perçue de notre produit et de développer de nouvelles recettes innovantes avec nos clients.  </p>
<p>Certaines bières pressions seront produites en quantité limitée : des bières de saison ou des recettes exclusives par exemple.  Cette démarche de co-création sera totalement aboutie lors d’ateliers organisés avec notre communauté de passionnés.</p>
<p>Grace à son expérience professionnelle internationale, Mattieu a eu la chance de savourer des bières artisanales brassées dans plus de 40 pays ! Durant plusieurs années, il a su développer un grand éclectisme culinaire. Son ouverture d’esprit combinée à son expérience brassicole et à son souci du détail permettra de réaliser un produit subtil et délicieux.</p>
<p>La réussite de notre brasserie artisanale française tient donc autant à la haute qualité de notre bière qu’à la communauté de passionnés pour qui nous œuvrerons.</p>
<h3>Autres façons de nous aider :</h3>
<p>Si vous ne pouvez pas contribuer financièrement, vous pouvez quand même aider !</p>
<p>En effet, nous organiserons prochainement plusieurs concours et nous aurons besoin de vous pour partager et faire connaître notre brasserie à vos proches. N’hésitez donc pas à renseigner votre adresse e-mail pour rester informés de la suite de nos projets.</p>

Here is how we can do it if we get funded! 

What YOU Get:
Who doesn't prefer a beer on tap?!
Of course, we are thrilled that people will be able to enjoy our beer in a bottle, but the experience of beer on draft is unique. Also, the community that develops in a taproom is one of our top priorities. We will be able to accommodate groups, have events, and do regular tours of the brewing process (a.k.a brew days!)

Taprooms and many popular American beer styles like the West Coast IPA, Gose, Farmhouse Ale, and Brett to name a few are not super common in France.

Risks & Challenges

But isn’t there already beer in France and Europe?
Yes, however, we are aiming to position ourselves to introduce products in gaps in the existing market. We are paying close attention to the existing beers and strategically, developing recipes that introduce something new while supporting a local economy. In general, the market for our product is increasing in momentum. The craft beer market is growing faster in France than the industrial beer market. The time to start this project is now!
What about cultural preferences and established trends in the tastes of the French market? 
One of our largest challenges is adapting our recipes to a new audience. We want to give time and attention to the palettes of our audience. We have conducted focus groups and continue to fine tune recipes specific to our customers. An added advantage of our taproom is the continued contact with customers and their experience of our beer. We will continue to make new recipes and experiment. Beers on tap can be seasonal or evolve into distributed signatures. We want to build a community too and make awesome beer together.
Matt’s experience brewing and capacity for detail, are also essential to this process. Due to his extensive travel during his sales work, he has had the opportunity to taste beer and visit breweries in over 40 countries. His time spent in various cultures with wildly different food trends informs his openness to try new things and consider the preferences specific to various audiences.

Nous avons la vocation de brasser des bières artisanales de style américain en utilisant des matières premières françaises.  Au printemps 2019, nous ouvrirons notre brasserie artisanale à Amboise : une ville médiévale située à seulement 2 heures de Paris. Nos locaux se tiendront  à moins de 100 mètres du mythique château de la Renaissance, résidence royale exceptionnelle et dernière demeure de Léonard de Vinci. Nos bières seront brassées et embouteillées sur place. Egalement, nous pourrons vous accueillir dans notre bar à dégustation afin d’y savourer nos productions.  Nos bières seront principalement distribuées en France : en boutiques spécialisées ainsi que dans certains bars, hôtels et restaurants. Notre vocation est de proposer des bières aux styles américains (comme des West Coast IPA) tout en utilisant des matières premières Françaises de haute qualité.  En effet, chez Art Is An Ale Brewing, nous filtrerons nos brassins et carbonaterons la bière en cuves de garde. Cette technique de mise en bouteille bien particulière (importée d’Amérique du Nord) permet de conserver les mêmes saveurs et arômes que dans les bières en pression.

A propos de nous…
Mattieu est Français.  Après ses études, il s’est expatrié à Los Angeles, pour poursuivre une carrière dans l’aéronautique en tant qu’ingénieur commercial.  Durant plus de 10 ans et en occupant différents postes (Vice-Président des ventes, Responsable des équipes et campagnes de ventes, etc.), Mattieu s’est vu confier des responsabilités sur des projets représentant plus de 250 millions de dollars. En novembre 2008, alors qu’il résidait en Californie, il est devenu un brasseur passionné. Depuis cette date, il a régulièrement produit ses brassins.
En observant l’évolution du marché de la bière artisanale aux Etats-Unis et en capitalisant sur son expérience professionnelle, Mattieu se lança le défi de créer sa propre brasserie artisanale. Il est donc revenu dans son pays natal pour se consacrer à son rêve et se donner pleinement les moyens de l’atteindre.. Durant son séjour aux Etats-Unis, Mattieu a rencontré Katie : sa future femme. Katie est une artiste, designer graphique indépendante. Elle a notamment travaillé pour de grandes entreprises. Ensemble, nous associons nos talents et notre créativité pour construire une entreprise qui mettra la bière artisanale à l’honneur et qui répondre aux exigences de la communauté des passionnés de bière.
Nos besoins et vos récompenses
Nous avons besoin de 30 000 euros pour acheter une embouteilleuse isobarométrique.
Cette machine permettra de mettre en place un procédé de fabrication de bière novateur en France. Grâce à elle, nous obtiendrons une bière limpide dont la la qualité se conservera davantage.. En somme, nos bières bouteilles dégustées à la maison seront tout aussi excellentes que nos bières pressions !
Aujourd’hui, sur le marché français de la bière artisanale, la méthode prédominante consiste à re-fermenter la bière mise en bouteille. Ce procédé a souvent un effet néfaste sur la saveur et la qualité du produit. En effet, des « faux-goûts » proviennent de la levure et masquent de subtiles saveurs pourtant recherchées par les brasseurs artisanaux. L’optimisation des saveurs d’une bière peut varier en fonction de la température et de la durée de conservation.  Pour plus d’information, n’hésitez pas à regarder notre série de vidéos.




 

Vos compensations Qui préfère la bière pression ?   Evidemment, nous tous ! Nous sommes ravis de vous faire découvrir nos bières en bouteilles ayant la même saveur que nos bières en pression.  De plus, nous avons à cœur de créer une communauté d’amateurs de bières qui se retrouveront dans notre bar à dégustation.  Nous serons en mesure de recevoir de grands groupes, organiser des évènements et vous faire visiter notre espace de production lors des différentes étapes du brassage.  Nous souhaitons que les gens viennent autant pour savourer notre bière que pour être témoins de notre savoir-faire et de la qualité de nos produits.
L’embouteilleuse isobarométrique va nous permettre de développer un gout authentique dans chacune de nos bouteilles. Ainsi, chez vous comme n’importe où ailleurs, vous retrouverez l’authenticité et la qualité de la bière Art is An Ale de notre bar à dégustations. Vos récompenses :
Si vous faites un don à notre campagne, nous vous proposons un large choix d’articles et d’expériences uniques.  Cela peut aller du simple sticker à une séance de brassage VIP. Vous avez l’embarras du choix : allez les découvrir !
Que se passe-t-il si on n’atteint pas notre but ?
Pas de problème : vous recevrez vos articles quoi qu’il arrive ?
A ce compte-là, nous réduirons le nombre ou la taille de nos fermenteurs et minimiserons le coût d’achat de notre salle de brassage. Ceci aura pour effet de réduire notre capacite de production mais n’impactera en rien la qualité de nos produits.  Nous faisons ainsi le choix d’amoindrir la quantité plutôt que d’abaisser la qualité.
Cependant, conserver notre capacité de production est stratégique pour notre brasserie : elle est un élément clef de notre équilibre financier. Il est donc important de pouvoir atteindre notre but pour cette campagne et de ne pas renoncer à nos quantités prévisionnelles. Bref, on compte sur vous !

L’impact
En contribuant à notre campagne, vous aiderez la culture bière artisanale à se populariser et à trouver sa place dans notre communauté .  Un bar à degustation et des styles de bière comme des West Coast IPA , Gose, Farmhouse, Brett et beaucoup d’autres encore ne sont pas populaires en France, c’est pourquoi nous voulons amener de la diversité, collaborer avec des brasseurs français et étrangers afin de faire partie de la communauté brassicole.  De plus, comme notre projet se situe dans un lieu très touristique, nous espérons devenir une destination pour les amateurs étrangers de bières artisanales en visite en France. On pense que l’expérience de notre bar à dégustation restera un très bon souvenir pour les nombreuses personnes qui visitent notre ville et bien sûr aussi pour les amboisiens . Ce sera un lieu de rassemblement et de bien être.  La distribution de nos bières en bouteille en France est un élément clé de notre stabilité financière et elle nous permettra d’exister sur le marché. En outre, Nous souhaiterions que vous puissiez boire nos bières ou que vous soyez !

Risques et challenges
Mais n’y a-t-il déjà pas suffisamment de bières en France et en Europe ?  Peut-être…  MAIS, nos produits ont des caractéristiques différentes de celles de nos concurrents.  Nous surveillons le marché et, stratégiquement, nous développons des recettes inédites. Nous avons également à cœur de supporter l’économie locale en achetant des produits de proximité.
De façon générale, le marché français pour nos bières a le vent en poupe. Il s’accroît plus rapidement que le marché de la bière industrielle.  C’est donc MAINTENANT qu’il nous faut lancer notre projet !
Les préférences culturelles et les tendances gustatives du marché français font parties de nos priorités majeures. Notre enjeu est bien de savoir adapter nos recettes au goût de notre clientèle. Pour être ainsi à l’écoute des désirs de nos clients, nous avons déjà organisé des séances de dégustation pour mieux affiner nos recettes.
Notre bar de dégustation est l’opportunité d’être en contact immédiat avec les consommateurs de notre bière. Cela permettra d’échanger en direct sur la qualité perçue de notre produit et de développer de nouvelles recettes innovantes avec nos clients.  
Certaines bières pressions seront produites en quantité limitée : des bières de saison ou des recettes exclusives par exemple.  Cette démarche de co-création sera totalement aboutie lors d’ateliers organisés avec notre communauté de passionnés.
Grace à son expérience professionnelle internationale, Mattieu a eu la chance de savourer des bières artisanales brassées dans plus de 40 pays ! Durant plusieurs années, il a su développer un grand éclectisme culinaire. Son ouverture d’esprit combinée à son expérience brassicole et à son souci du détail permettra de réaliser un produit subtil et délicieux.
La réussite de notre brasserie artisanale française tient donc autant à la haute qualité de notre bière qu’à la communauté de passionnés pour qui nous œuvrerons.
Autres façons de nous aider :
Si vous ne pouvez pas contribuer financièrement, vous pouvez quand même aider !
En effet, nous organiserons prochainement plusieurs concours et nous aurons besoin de vous pour partager et faire connaître notre brasserie à vos proches. N’hésitez donc pas à renseigner votre adresse e-mail pour rester informés de la suite de nos projets.",6.0,6,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Mame’s Burrito’s is a story of Mame, who fourteen years ago at the age of 65 started Mame’s Burrito Company.  She followed her heart and passion and started making fresh high-quality handcrafted burritos igniting a burrito craving community. Her rich story is one of persistence, passion, integrity and strength, and she inspires us daily.</p>
<p>Have you ever gone to the store to grab a quick meal to warm up in the microwave and been disappointed?  Have you noticed that everything is changing in the world of food – from the way people eat, grocery shop, cook, and have food delivered? It is becoming more and more customized and tailored to a lifestyle with a new generation of possibilities.   We are reaching outside of the box and meeting people where they want to shop and eat high quality yummy prepared food, such as coffee shops, food service, frozen grocery and specialty stores.  Mame’s is elevating the grab and go space with food that is just prepared better, with care and love and premium ingredients.</p>
<p>Over the past year, Mame’s has been preparing the company to go big!  What started in local coffee shops has expanded into frozen retail. In April of 2018, Mame’s launched in 123 King Soopers stores in Colorado. Our loyal customers are excited to now have their favorite burrito in their very own freezer to enjoy whenever they want, and our tribe is growing!</p>
<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
<p>Our launch into frozen grocery has been greeted with such success that we are looking to expand across the nation, not just in grocery, but in coffee shops, specialty food stores, and foodservice (think college campuses, hospitals, hotels and more)!  Our model has worked in Colorado, and we know we can replicate it nationally – people are asking for us!</p>
<p>Your contribution to our campaign at any level will help to fill Mame’s lifelong dream of spreading food as love across the country with Mame’s Burritos.  If you are interested in an equity position, please contact us separately and we can get you details!</p>
<p>Growth is expensive, and Mame’s will be prepared to support our “go big” burrito campaign with sales and marketing, logistics and support.</p>
<h3><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></h3>
<p>Thank you for checking out our Indiegogo campaign.  Even if you are not able to contribute financially, you are an important part of our growth and you make it all possible! Here are some other things you can do to help us:</p>

<h3>How Our Journey Began</h3>
<p>My name is Patricia ""Patt"" Mabin. I am a descendant of Chief Little Thunder (Joseph Gourneau) and his father before him, Old Wild Rice, one of the earliest recorded chiefs of the Pembina/Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians. I began this journey when my brother Mike and I were driving home after spending the day in Belcourt, North Dakota, on the Turtle Mountain Reservation. We were talking about our heritage and our futures. I expressed that I’d like to find a way to bring our past into the present and keep our culture alive. The discussion of bison, survival, and ingenuity started to unfold, and when pemmican was mentioned, the vision began.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1588953274/t3wuspp3gju9aujhcuvz.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>I believe that Pemmican Patty breathed new life into a worn-out woman. As a teenage single mother, I got my GED and began a long stretch of minimum wage jobs to provide for myself and my son.  Over the past 6 decades, I’ve been divorced (more than once), recovered from alcoholism and addiction (more than once). I've been treated for depression (more than once), had 3 major surgeries, countless minor surgeries, and survived a serious ATV accident. I’ve been homeless, uninsured and without a car. I’ve also visited or lived in many of the states west of the Mississippi, had the honor of caring for my Grandmother during her last year of life, and <strong>learned that money might make living “easier” but true riches (and character) come from hardship. The most I’ve really had to offer has been time and love.</strong></p>
<p>In my late 50s’, I lived in Mexico for a year before bringing my 7-year-old granddaughter to North Dakota to live with me. I journeyed with her through tuberculosis, all her childhood vaccinations, mega dental work, and into middle school when her family decided to take her back. After a lifetime of putting others before myself, I was over 60, overweight, without an income, without a car and unable to afford rent.  After moving back into my parents’ basement and being treated for depression once more, I struggled to consider a future, much less try to dream up something new to try!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1588953253/r8wzgqlvfgrw8yrxdcpb.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>With the help of the Creator, my family and especially my brother, the dream of Pemmican Patty has come alive. It has given me renewed hope and purpose. It’s strengthened family ties and provided a view of the past and a vision for the future. It’s living proof that the joy is in the journey! Based on a strong desire to keep our heritage alive, my brother, nephew and I learned that our Metis ancestors, as well as our Grandma Ida, made pemmican to sustain themselves and others, including trappers, traders and soldiers.  Dubbed “the indigenous super food,” our version of pemmican is made of real food. A combination of bison, beef, berries, sunflowers, and a hint of honey provides a convenient, natural source of energy for people on the go in today’s modern world. My hope is for this product to promote good health and preserve Metis traditions, one pemmican bite at a time!</p>

<h3>We are building a plant-based restaurant! </h3>
<p>I am so excited to update you about our newest project! Meet The Plot: a lively, inviting restaurant. We make delicious, high-quality, and sometimes boundary-pushing food that is completely plant-based. A conscientious business with operations that benefit our team, the health of our communities and the future of our planet.</p>
<p>Our goal: build one, make it awesome, then build many.</p>
<p><strong>We want to bring you the best possible version of a business: epic plant-based food, great design, local and regenerative sourcing, and zero-waste operations.</strong></p>

<h3>Coming soon to south O!</h3>
<p>We are building out the first of what we intend to be a chain of plant based restaurants. We found an amazing old building in South Oceanside, CA, less than a block from our first two restaurants. It's a great big space that is perfectly located, with room for 150 seats plus a commissary kitchen to supply future locations, grab-and-go sales and retail food operations. Our lease even came with a small rental cottage that has a huge yard where we will create an urban garden and host private events. The only catch is that it is costing us a lot more to build out than we originally raised.</p>

<p><strong>Zero Waste Ethos</strong></p>
<p>Food waste is a costly practice. According to a report by NPR, one half pound of food for every restaurant guest served, on average, is discarded.

<p>The report outlined three main solutions, all of which are components of our business plan! </p>
<p>1. Eat less meat: we are completely plant-based! </p>
<p>2. Waste less food (less organics in landfill): we are a zero-waste restaurant</p>
<p>3. Make farmland more productive: we support local and regenerative farming </p>

<h3>Investing in people </h3>
<p><strong>A Strong Partnership - Davin + Jess: </strong>Our partnership stems from a shared passion for the ideals on which we have built our companies, and for the challenge of making these ideals marketable and accessible. We both want to change the world for the better and see an opportunity to do this by building a business that is efficient, scalable, and that will set the bar high for those that come after it. </p>
<p>We currently own and operate two restaurants that are plant and seafood-centric. We work to minimize waste and respect the planet by practicing total utilization and waste minimizing techniques. We work with local farms and fishermen and understand that the most sustainable and tastiest products are those that are sourced locally and seasonally. Davin has been offering vegan options on his menus since 2004 and he believes strongly that moving in a plant-based direction makes sense.</p>
<p><strong>A Well-Rounded Team:</strong> While we were not lacking in passion, drive and operational experience we have identified our need for a team member with a strong history in corporate operations and scaling. Christopher Logan has long been a mentor to both of us and brings with him decades of such needed experience.</p>
<h3>Risks &amp; challenges</h3>
<p>There are plenty of hurdles to overcome when building a successful restaurant business.  Davin and Jess boot-strapped Wrench &amp; Rodent with almost nothing to their names. After six years in business they have learned from mistakes, built a strong team, and have had the opportunity to support a broad range of local businesses and organizations. Our team knows that to be truly resilient we need a community, and have learned much from a broad range of advisors and supporters. </p>

<h3>Other ways you can help</h3>
<p>Help comes in all forms. If you are not able to make a monetary contribution we would greatly appreciate if you would share your enthusiasm for our project via social media, or by sending links to our campaign to your friends.</p>

We are building a plant-based restaurant! 
I am so excited to update you about our newest project! Meet The Plot: a lively, inviting restaurant. We make delicious, high-quality, and sometimes boundary-pushing food that is completely plant-based. A conscientious business with operations that benefit our team, the health of our communities and the future of our planet.
Our goal: build one, make it awesome, then build many.
We want to bring you the best possible version of a business: epic plant-based food, great design, local and regenerative sourcing, and zero-waste operations.


Coming soon to south O!
We are building out the first of what we intend to be a chain of plant based restaurants. We found an amazing old building in South Oceanside, CA, less than a block from our first two restaurants. It's a great big space that is perfectly located, with room for 150 seats plus a commissary kitchen to supply future locations, grab-and-go sales and retail food operations. Our lease even came with a small rental cottage that has a huge yard where we will create an urban garden and host private events. The only catch is that it is costing us a lot more to build out than we originally raised.

<p>The Pot Goes Italian</p>
<p>Firstly, thank you for taking the time to check out our Crowdfunder. We really want you to feel invested, so rather than give you a token reward (a coffee or your initials on a wall in the toilets) we REALLY want to reward you; our investors. That’s why we have set up our rewards so you can easily earn your investment back and more, we are literally  giving away food, drink and money! The more you invest the more you get back, we've hopefully set this up in a way that nobody feels out of pocket and you all get to share our continued success with lifetime discounts available.</p>
<p>So why are we doing this?</p>
<p>Put simply, over the last few years running The Pot bistro we’ve seen a real change in dining habits, coupled by a genuine slowdown in the economy. We feel now is the time to really shake things up; it's essentially do or die and we want to continue bringing our award winning food to the people of Cardiff for years to come... but in a slightly different format; there is also a definite gap in the market for an Italian style restaurant on Whitchurch road and the Heath area.</p>
<p>So what’s the plan!</p>
<p>We’re going to open a truly modern Italian restaurant the likes of which Cardiff has never seen before, focusing on handmade pastas, artisan pizzas and a twist on some classic dishes.</p>
<p>We plan to fuse local and seasonal produce with classic Italian ingredients, whilst keeping to our well known roots from our successful French bistro- to create dishes like Confit Duck lasagne and Lobster Arancini with Thermador sauce.</p>
<p>We really want to tap into the growing takeaway market using apps like Deliveroo and Just Eat, and this is where Italian food comes into its own... imagine getting one of our delicious handmade pastas delivered to your door with a tasty artisan pizza and a side of arancini…..Belissimo! </p>
<p>We are also hoping to add a &amp; deli counter to the operation , we would provide sandwiches, pasta pots, cured meats, chutneys and a selection of welsh/ Italian cheeses and Chef made ready meals to take home at the end of a busy day! </p>
<p>We are also  looking to branch out into event catering for weddings, private functions and eventually private dining, bringing a taste of restaurant quality food to your home.</p>
<p>But what’s your experience!</p>
<p>Well, as you know we’ve owned The Pot Bistro for 6 years now, winning multiple awards that culminated in three last year including a 'Highly commended chef of the year' for Rhys- one of our owners. Rhys has been running kitchens for the past 21 years spending 11 of those in Italian kitchens working his way up to a 2 Rosette level. This is really where his passion lies, Italian food is his first love and he is really looking forward to sharing it with you. </p>
<p>Your used  to being greeted by Laura- our other owner. She is the glue that has held The Pot together for the past 6 years , spearheading the menu designs to the décor and bringing you the relaxed but prompt professional service that you have all become accustomed too.</p>
<p>What’s the money for!</p>
<p>So let’s get down to brass taxes! Your money will be going towards a refurbishment of the Whitchurch road site and the new deli, lots of new equipment for both sites including a pizza oven, pasta makers and a dough mixer. New signage, general fixtures and fittings and some outdoor lights to illuminate the building. </p>
<p>Rewards!</p>
<p>We are offering a range of rewards from £5 up to £1000  rewards from £25 up will get a  loyalty card that will entitle  the bearer to a 20%  discount on food, £50 will entitle the bearer to a discount for 2 people and £100 for 4, the discount card will be capped at 6 people for the pledge of £150 and above. </p>
<p>We feel this is the fairest way to reward you all and  keep the business viable in the long term..........Happy Pledging!</p>
<p>Risks and challenges</p>
<p>As with everything there is risk but having owned a successful business for the last 6 years and with a combined experience of over 30 years in the hospitality trade, we feel they are small. We know the area and market well and see a bright future ahead.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Tom Cat's Kitchen will be a cafe and deli that provides rich and healthful breakfast foods, coffee drinks, fresh juices, and grab &amp; go options to get the neighborhood's morning commuters and incoming office workers nourished for their day. We will run a lively lunch service focused on quick turn-around times to cater to those working nearby seeking a quick and healthy lunch or juice pick-me-up. Weekends will feature a hearty brunch menu utilizing ingredients from the nearby Farmer's Market and Bring Your Own Bubbles for mimosas made with fresh-pressed juices. The Greenmount corridor is a main thoroughfare for public transit and for individuals commuting from adjacent areas such as Belvedere Square, Govans, or Lake Montebello on their way downtown or to 83 access. As a historic main street, it's avenues were planned to capture traffic and create a business hub. Tom Cat's will be a key player in re-establishing this Baltimore main street.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Helping Tom Cat's Kitchen also helps you! </p>
<p>In order to finalize the details of our lease we must meet certain funding goals. By participating in this crowdfunding push you will be a crucial factor in the success of Tom Cat's Kitchen. Aside from the good feelings, you will receive awesome swag and membership in our coffee club.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The vision for Tom Cat's has been in development across a collective 30 years of hospitality experience. The owners, Anna and Janell,  have each spent time in just about every role in the restaurant world, having first met in the soft lights and loud music of Joe Squared on North Ave.  Within the past seven years, Anna has advanced to varying levels of management in four different food concepts and has found her strengths in team-building and operations management with a particular eye on finance. Janell's time in the industry has been spent in many roles, serving a wide range of audiences. At one point in her career her dedication to a vegan hot dog business helped it thrive in the unique market of metal music shows. Combine Anna's financial management experience with Janell's passion for great food and fantastic hospitality with the growing trend towards more conscientious eating and the success of Tom Cat's becomes clear and attainable. Tom Cat's Kitchen will be an important part of the Waverly community in providing a thoughtful and healthy approach to delicious food in a space for quick coffees, lunches with friends, and afternoons spent on your laptop. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>While small business loans are available to us, unrealistic repayment terms and inflated interest rates would immediately place the business in a financially unfavorable position, angling us towards an unstable future. </p>
<p>Exploring non-traditional funding options became necessary. Grants, micro-loans, crowdfunding and crowd investing are the paths we are pursuing to realize our dream.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We understand that not everyone is in a position to contribute financially, but we will accept all the help that we can get. So please...</p>
<p>Talk about our plans and adventures with the people in your life.</p>
<p>Share our crowdfunding goal, future events and updates with your social network.</p>

<p>""It is more than just a fish scaler. M-scaler brings a second life to materials that would otherwise be wasted or even cause environmental pollution.” </p>

<p>It is a fish scaling tool that is made from 100% recycled plastic. Whether you are preparing a salmon dinner at home or cleaning a newly caught fish during a camping trip, M-scaler is the ideal tool to help you accomplish your task. The tool comes with a built-in bottle opener and a magnetic connector, allowing you to pop open your favorite beverage and use the lid as a replaceable blade to slice off fish scales from all angles. The strong ceramic magnet ensures your blade to attach firmly throughout the fish scaling, while the handle is carefully crafted to optimize the user experience. </p>

<p>Eugene: </p>
<p>Hi! I am an IB student who is taking economics and business management. I have fallen in love with Daniel's idea of creating a fish scaling tool that is made entirely from recycled materials a year ago and started my partnership with him ever since. Daniel is an incredible achiever who could balance his hard-core academic studies with his interest in other pursuits, not to mention the fact that he single-handedly designed, created, and presented one of the most meaningful products that I have seen. I am thrilled to be able to apply my knowledge and put theories into real use, starting my own business with my talented friend Daniel. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Daniel: </p>
<p>Hello! I am an AP student who is taking Calculus BC and Physic C and I can't wait to share my story with you. M-scaler has won a gold medal in the International Trade Fair 'Ideas-Inventions-New Products' iENA at Nuremberg Germany, and that was the end of its journey for a long time. Not that I didn't think of upscaling my invention, but I wasn't certain of HOW. That is why I was overjoyed when I finally met Eugene about a year ago. Other than his perfect grades in academics, I could feel his commitment to this project from just the look in his eyes; I know he is a trustworthy person who has the expertise to assist me in bringing M-scaler to the next level. I have no doubt that we would create something spectacular together. </p>

<h3>Our Passion </h3>
<p>Our passion for environment protection and recycling originated from our high school chemistry class, which we were studying ozone deconstruction and its impact. The curriculum also mentioned how this phenomenon has caused climate change and the possible solutions to respond. In summary, it all comes down to two things: adaptation and mitigation. This got us thinking, are we really going to accept the fact that our environment is ruined and cope with the new normal of extreme weather, or are we going to take initiatives that could reduce the impact and attempt to fix climate change? Obviously, we have chosen the latter. </p>

<h3>Why choose M-scaler</h3>
<p>We always believe that M-scaler is beyond an ordinary fish scaling tool. Made from 100% recycled plastic, M-scaler brings a second life to materials that would otherwise be wasted or even cause environmental pollution. Think of it this way: if we could add value to used materials, this would provide an incentive for people to start recycling because these materials are no longer wastes, but scarce resources. The effect could be amplified if more and more people could recognize the importance of recycling and protecting the environment and actually start taking actions within their community. Our vision is for individuals to affect neighbors, neighbors to affect their community, community to affect an entire nation, and eventually, nation to affect other nations. We dream of a healthier, cleaner, and more sustainable planet, and <strong>we can't achieve that without you. </strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>We view M-scaler as an epitome of recycling. Yes, it is a useful and well-designed tool, but what is more, is the idea it represents. Through M-scaler, we want to convey the message that <strong>everyone is responsible for the environment.</strong> Whether you are a businessman, a lawyer, an artist, a chef, or a mechanic, we all live on this planet, there are no outsiders. If two inexperienced high school students could do this much, what could you do to make this world a better place? </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>More reasons to choose M-scaler</h3>
<p>1. Compared to traditional fish scaling tools, M-scaler has better food hygiene since the scaling blade is replaceable. This prevents the scaling tool to become rusty and reduces the chance of eating bacteria-contaminated fish. </p>
<p>2. M-scaler is a perfect two-in-one tool for outdoor activities lovers. You could easily fit M-scaler inside your backpack, using it to open chilling beverages or remove the fish scales from a fish that you just caught while enjoying the beauty of nature. </p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We have already produced four fully functional prototypes, and we are aiming to raise 20,000 USD to move on to mass production. Each dollar you contributed would bring us closer to our goal. The fund will be used to purchase recycled plastics, pay the cost of plastic injection mold, and serve as our operational fund to pay for manufacturing and other expenses. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Together, we could make the world a better place.</strong> By funding our project, you are not just supporting a startup business, but a good cause. The more fish scaler we could sell, the more “wastes” could be transformed into recycled goods, and fewer pollutants will be harming the environment. This is also the chance for you to receive one (or multiple) M-scaler at a HUGE discount price and be directly involved in helping the planet. </p>

<h3>Development </h3>
<p>We built the first-generation M-scaler with wood. However, this model is limited by the undesired thickness and heavyweight. This prompts us to replace the materials with a lighter alternative. </p>

<p> </p>
<p>We built the second-generation M-scaler with plastic. The original design was to squeeze the bottle cap directly into the handle, but this creates structural issues as the blade would not be stable enough to smoothly remove fish scales. This prompts us to produce our third and final generation M-scaler, which includes a ceramic magnet to firmly secure the bottle cap. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1590566340/egmwndbxcuc9jjgr7jdn.png"" src=""""/></p>

<p>I grew up and continue to live here in Traverse City, MI. I've
spent my entire life being in, on or around the water. I've skied, snowboarded,
snowmobiled, hiked, biked and just about everything else the Great Lakes region
has to offer. I've gone through several incarnations of employment, with many
years in corporate America. But I've always had a wandering eye, and over the
years I've often dreamed of being able to leave the daily grind of sales
meetings and TPS reports behind and do something on my own… something that I
love and something that incorporates the region that I love so much.</p>
<p>The question of ""What if?"" was a constant companion. If I ever had
the opportunity, What would “it” look like, sound like, taste like? What
is “it”? Kind of like those questions of what you would do if you ever won the
lottery. Thanks to my family and some very good friends who gently but firmly
helped push me off the ledge of self-employment terror, “it” turned out to be
Food Baby the food truck.</p>
<p>Food Baby isn't designed to be just another ""me too"" food
truck. My intent is to stay away from the typical taco and same ole' sliders. I
want Food Baby to be against the grain, in a good way. In other words, you'll
see things coming out of Food Baby that are far from typical in this area. I'll
cook what I love and what I love is typically off the beaten path. While the
menu is still on the DL, you’ll see menu items ranging from Asian
to Caribbean, from Creole and Cajun to Latin and maybe even Middle
Eastern. There is one dish that I’m particularly excited about that I won’t
divulge yet. I believe it’ll be huge if I can get the hard to find ingredients
and specialized equipment required to make it. I’ll be selling out of the truck
most days while spending a day or so doing prep work in a local downtown
commercial kitchen. I’m very excited to get started.</p>
<p>Now for the darkness… </p>
<p>The universe, it seems, is full of forces that want to stop us from
achieving our goals and realizing our dreams. They stand in our way and refuse
to move and it’s up to us to find a way around them. They are ever present and,
for whatever reason, they really don’t like us very much. For me, that force is
a man named Nic.</p>
<p>Last spring, I contracted with Nic in Raleigh, North Carolina to build a
kitchen in my already purchased truck. It was a decision I felt comfortable
with as I had already conversed with literally dozens of other food truck
sellers, builders and buyers. According to our agreement, the truck was to be
finished in late May, early June… It wasn't. Every couple days I’d ask for a
progress report and he’d give me a little good news followed by an excuse of
waiting for some piece of equipment or some ""person"" to install
something. I asked for photos several times but there was always a reason he
was unable to send them. (This was obviously a major red flag.) Nic made every
excuse in the book and being 1,000 miles away I had no choice but to try to be
patient. At one point, he ceased communication all together and I had to hire a
private investigator just to get him on the phone! Time marched on and before I
knew it, my first selling season had slowly faded away. By the end of August I
still didn’t have a food truck. In retrospect, it appears that Nic never
really intended to fulfill his contractual obligation. He has made promises
since to refund a pathetically small part of my investment but he has made no
effort to follow through despite many attempts to collect. Last fall I
retrieved my truck and its currently being built but I'm still out my initial
investment and many more thousands of dollars in related expenses. Not to
mention lost revenue! It’s especially tragic knowing that I was not the only
victim of this evil doer. Here’s a link to a news story about Nic. No joke…</p>
<p><a href=""http://abc11.com/news/i-team-whats-keeping-food-trucks-from-hitting-the-roads-/501183/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><b><u>http://abc11.com/news/i-team-whats-keeping-food-trucks-from-hitting-the-roads-/501183/</u></b></a></p>
<p>Thus, the need for this Indiegogo campaign. I am currently in the process of
paying for this project for a second time. I have everything, and then some,
into it. But I still need a little help. The truck will be complete when it
arrives in a few weeks. However, I will need to purchase several additional
pieces of equipment, pay inspection and licensing fees, insurance and have
reserves for operating capital. </p>
<p>The required equipment includes a couple of pieces that are very
specialized. One is a rice cooker/warmer. The second is, at this point, secret.
In the interest of protecting Food Baby’s niche, I think it best not to
broadcast my menu. The rest is the normal accoutrements you’d find in any
commercial kitchen</p>
<p>The fees payable include but may not be limited to the health department
inspection, vendor license fees in the city of Traverse City (this one is
quite expensive), event participation fees and additional inspection fees in
other counties that are also possible.</p>
<p>Why $20,000? The fact of the matter
is that Food trucks are expensive. I knew what I was getting into. But I really
didn’t plan on paying for mine twice. But that’s my reality. I’m past being
angry. I just want to get to work. I don’t really talk about Nic very often. I
only talk about the truck now… probably to the point of being annoying. It’s
literally the only thing I think about from the second I wake up to the moment
I go to bed. My brain is currently making plans to make a five year goal into a
two year accomplishment. Needless to say, it’s been a very challenging year
with extreme financial, mental and emotional strains. Not to mention the
strains on my personal relationships. It's been the best and worst year of my
life. And thanks to friends and family who have stood by me and
supported me through it all, I’m nearly there. I just need your help to finally
get this thing off the ground.</p>
<p>If you can’t contribute, don’t worry about it. You are already a citizen of
the Food Baby Nation!! But please share this on your Facebook page and email it
to EVERYONE you know. I need one more boost and together we can finally make
this happen.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance and God Bless.</p>
<p><b>For the record, Food Baby is currently being built by a very competent
and conscientious team in South Holland, Illinois, just south of Chicago.
Headed by Mick Walsh of Autofuture, I’m certain they are knocking it out of the
park as we speak. Even though I’ve not seen the finished product, I’ve seen
pictures of their progress and I can confidently give a glowing recommendation
to anyone looking for a food truck builder.</b></p>

see things coming out of Food Baby that are far from typical in this area. I'll
cook what I love and what I love is typically off the beaten path. While the
menu is still on the DL, you’ll see menu items ranging from Asian
to Caribbean, from Creole and Cajun to Latin and maybe even Middle
Eastern. There is one dish that I’m particularly excited about that I won’t
divulge yet. I believe it’ll be huge if I can get the hard to find ingredients
and specialized equipment required to make it. I’ll be selling out of the truck
most days while spending a day or so doing prep work in a local downtown
commercial kitchen. I’m very excited to get started.
Now for the darkness… 
The universe, it seems, is full of forces that want to stop us from
achieving our goals and realizing our dreams. They stand in our way and refuse
to move and it’s up to us to find a way around them. They are ever present and,
for whatever reason, they really don’t like us very much. For me, that force is
a man named Nic.
Last spring, I contracted with Nic in Raleigh, North Carolina to build a
kitchen in my already purchased truck. It was a decision I felt comfortable
with as I had already conversed with literally dozens of other food truck
sellers, builders and buyers. According to our agreement, the truck was to be
finished in late May, early June… It wasn't. Every couple days I’d ask for a
progress report and he’d give me a little good news followed by an excuse of
waiting for some piece of equipment or some ""person"" to install
something. I asked for photos several times but there was always a reason he
was unable to send them. (This was obviously a major red flag.) Nic made every
excuse in the book and being 1,000 miles away I had no choice but to try to be
patient. At one point, he ceased communication all together and I had to hire a
private investigator just to get him on the phone! Time marched on and before I
knew it, my first selling season had slowly faded away. By the end of August I
still didn’t have a food truck. In retrospect, it appears that Nic never
really intended to fulfill his contractual obligation. He has made promises
since to refund a pathetically small part of my investment but he has made no
effort to follow through despite many attempts to collect. Last fall I
retrieved my truck and its currently being built but I'm still out my initial
investment and many more thousands of dollars in related expenses. Not to
mention lost revenue! It’s especially tragic knowing that I was not the only
victim of this evil doer. Here’s a link to a news story about Nic. No joke…
http://abc11.com/news/i-team-whats-keeping-food-trucks-from-hitting-the-roads-/501183/
Thus, the need for this Indiegogo campaign. I am currently in the process of
paying for this project for a second time. I have everything, and then some,
into it. But I still need a little help. The truck will be complete when it
arrives in a few weeks. However, I will need to purchase several additional
pieces of equipment, pay inspection and licensing fees, insurance and have
reserves for operating capital. 
The required equipment includes a couple of pieces that are very
specialized. One is a rice cooker/warmer. The second is, at this point, secret.
In the interest of protecting Food Baby’s niche, I think it best not to
broadcast my menu. The rest is the normal accoutrements you’d find in any
commercial kitchen
The fees payable include but may not be limited to the health department
inspection, vendor license fees in the city of Traverse City (this one is
quite expensive), event participation fees and additional inspection fees in
other counties that are also possible.
Why $20,000? The fact of the matter
is that Food trucks are expensive. I knew what I was getting into. But I really
didn’t plan on paying for mine twice. But that’s my reality. I’m past being
angry. I just want to get to work. I don’t really talk about Nic very often. I
only talk about the truck now… probably to the point of being annoying. It’s
literally the only thing I think about from the second I wake up to the moment
I go to bed. My brain is currently making plans to make a five year goal into a
two year accomplishment. Needless to say, it’s been a very challenging year
with extreme financial, mental and emotional strains. Not to mention the
strains on my personal relationships. It's been the best and worst year of my
life. And thanks to friends and family who have stood by me and
supported me through it all, I’m nearly there. I just need your help to finally
get this thing off the ground.
If you can’t contribute, don’t worry about it. You are already a citizen of
the Food Baby Nation!! But please share this on your Facebook page and email it
to EVERYONE you know. I need one more boost and together we can finally make
this happen.
Thank you in advance and God Bless.
For the record, Food Baby is currently being built by a very competent
and conscientious team in South Holland, Illinois, just south of Chicago.
Headed by Mick Walsh of Autofuture, I’m certain they are knocking it out of the
park as we speak. Even though I’ve not seen the finished product, I’ve seen
pictures of their progress and I can confidently give a glowing recommendation
to anyone looking for a food truck builder.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Maya, I'm French and I'm 26 years old. I am married and I am the mother of a lovely baby boy. I have been interested by the catering industry since I discovered my mother's friend restaurant when I was young. Since that day I want to open a restaurant. I graduated from a Catering Business School at the age of 16 years old. I started my first internship at 14 in a restaurant. I have gained skills and I know how a restaurant works. I worked in gastronomic and Michelin star restaurants, discovering the tough rythme and the high level of professionalism of famous Chiefs. I worked in Nantes, Paris and London.</p>
<p>A while ago, I thought about how we could stop eating animals because I love them and care about them. My answer is THE CHOICE. I affirmed my convictions in London because the concept was more advanced in anglosaxon countries than in France. Therefore, I started to learn more about lifestyle. I'm vegetarian since 2012 but I don't consume cow milk because, according to me, cows are the most exploited and I definitely don't want to be a part of it. Sometimes, I eat some products from animals such as eggs but only organic.</p>
<p>My project is to create a franchise of Change your life in the world. For that, I need to start with my first restaurant which will be in NY, Manhattan. Afterwards, I would like to expand it in Florida, West Coast, Europe and in Asia. With this project I want to be part of the right sharing system with animals, that is to say we give them love and they give it to us. All of this with Love and not hate which is characterize by killing, massacre, profit, domination etc..</p>
<p>In addition, I plan to buy a farm because I will know that we will take care of my animals. For example: a chicken will give us her eggs, we will thank her with Love and Thankfulness. Concerning vegetables and fruits, they will be organic and harvest with Respect not thrown into a crate. I think that over consumption  destroys us and reinforces profit, which generates many negative things for our planet. </p>
<p>By contributing to my great project you will participate in a transformation on the relationship that we have with food, animals and nature. This will create a new era for us and our future generations.</p>

<p>Change Your Life will be a Vegan &amp; Vegetarian fast food restaurant located in Midtown, one of the most famous neighborhood of NYC. The restaurant will be based on the original idea of combining a vegan/vegetarian, organic and eco-friendly restaurant within a unique place. The creation of a unique and innovative FENG SHUI and VASTU atmosphere. People will be able to enjoy their food inside a contemporary and original restaurant or they will be able to take their meal to go.</p>
<p>The concept of the restaurant is to make people more sensitive concerning the food they eat, I want to prove them that organic food tastes better and is healthier. Moreover, our emphasis on organic ingredients is based on Change Your Life dedication to sustainable development. </p>
<p>In the center of Manhattan's culinary hot spot, Change Your Life will be a place known to have the best Vegan/Vegetarian food. The restaurant will feature a trendy, fun and friendly place with comfortable furnishings and decor with soothing coral and white tones.</p>
<p>The products will be either on demand or inspired by classic recipes, composed with trendy ingredients.

<p><a href=""http://www.drylanddistillers.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Dry Land Distillers</a> is a celebration of the people, places, and land of Colorado and the American West. Both of us (Nels and Aaron) grew up in the West, and we understand that the place we call home is a huge part of who we are.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1509565253/bzlkwdgx3uy454lufqea.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p>Several years ago, we were lucky enough to work on a yearlong magazine project to interview and profile new craft distilleries in Colorado and Wyoming. It was a delightful experience, and the people we met and the creativity and perseverance shown by these early entrepreneurs was inspiring. Aaron and I started tossing around the idea of our own distillery - and the idea stuck.</p>
<p>We began experimenting with different native and local ingredients such as prickly pear cactus, spruce trees, and a dry land, heirloom wheat to see if we could at least get a decent beer from the ingredients. We quickly realized there was huge potential in these ingredients – but they were also a huge challenge to work with. We stuck with it - and the results were incredible!</p>
<p>We enlisted the help of good friends of ours at <a href=""http://www.stillcellars.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Still Cellars</a> in Longmont to help us convert our recipes into distilled spirits in a few test runs. We shared the results with friends and strangers to rave reviews – and <a href=""http://www.drylanddistillers.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Dry Land Distillers</a> was born.</p>
<p>Today, we’re in the process of opening a craft distillery in the heart of downtown Longmont. Our spirits are influenced and inspired by Colorado’s lands and the American West’s iconic places. Our first production includes a dry land heirloom wheat whiskey, two unique prickly pear spirits, and a dry land spruce gin created with all Colorado native botanicals.</p>

<h3>How You Can Become Part of History</h3>
<p>Your support in this campaign will ensure we have a strong launch in the spring of 2018. We're looking to raise $25,000 in our phase 1 campaign to help with the build out of the distillery.</p>
<p>Here are some important facts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our goal is to raise at least $25,000 - there is no cap, so <strong>we're trying to exceed this goal!</strong>
</li>
<li>The funds will be used to pay for expenses in our build-out and launch, such as structural improvements, required equipment (e.g. glycol chiller), and raw ingredients for our spirits.</li>
<li>If we don't meet our goal - things get harder, but not impossible! We have funding to complete our build-out, but we need your support with our launch this spring.</li>
<li>We are in a unique position compared to most new distillery startups - <strong>we've already got our recipes tested and our first barrels aging thanks to the support of Still Cellars</strong>.</li>
<li>We did every bit of the process ourselves - sourcing the ingredients, mashes, fermentations, and distillations. Jason and Sadye let us use their equipment to get our first barrels ready, and we're already hosting tastings of our spirits in their tasting room.</li>
<li>We felt strongly that we wanted to have our first barrels ready in advance of launching our campaign to minimize any risk of production delays on our side.</li>
<li>Our reclaimed aspen wood coasters and t-shirts are already in stock for this campaign - another plus.</li>
</ul>

<p><i>Photo: Aaron Main, master distiller, empties the parrot in our first production run of  our Dry Land Heirloom Wheat Whiskey at Still Cellars.</i></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your support does more than just help to create a new craft distillery. You'll be supporting the vision for a Longmont community hub. The building we're leasing is one of the oldest historical landmarks in downtown, and will be home to a <a href=""http://www.experiencecowork.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">community co-working space</a>, a live music and arts events venue, and a <a href=""http://longmontcoffee.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">craft coffee shop</a> and restaurant.</p>
<p>Some key points about our project:</p>
<ul>
<li>Aaron and Nels are experienced professionals. Aaron is a master brewer and manages lab systems for a biotech company. Nels is an experienced product manager, has started a successful coffee shop, and has a long history working with small distillers in Colorado.</li>
<li>We have compiled a top-notch team to build our distillery, including a leading distillery architectural firm (<u><a href=""http://www.dalkita.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Dalkita Architecture</a></u>) and an experienced local contractor (<u><a href=""http://www.lsebuildersgroup.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">LSE Builders Group</a></u>).</li>
<li>Our collaboration with Still Cellars has given us a huge head start - our products are already in production. We will have revenue up to nine months earlier than most startup distilleries since we will have products available at our opening.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1509564401/ejrj9sudoolvqx2ct6xd.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>This is a big project! Starting a craft distillery is hard enough, but we've made it even more complex by designing products that require uncommon ingredients. Seems crazy, but the benefits significantly outweigh the risks.</p>
<p>Here are some things you'll want to evaluate as you look to support our campaign:</p>
<ul>
<li>Risk to Production. Most craft distillery startups have a long lead time before they have products available. We've mitigated this risk by partnering with Still Cellars. <strong>Our first whiskey and prickly pear spirits are recipe-tested and in barrels</strong> - so we know we can fulfill our perks! </li>
<li>New and unproven industry. Craft distilleries are new and are generally unproven. The industry is at a similar point that craft breweries were 20 years ago. <strong>We view this as a huge opportunity</strong> - getting in early means we have significant upside and growth potential.</li>
<li>Permitting and licensing. Our federal DSP license is in process, and we see no reason that our permit should be delayed; but we won't know for several months. We can't open our distillery without this permit. <strong>That's why we've collaborated with Still Cellars to ensure we can legally distill under a federally licensed distillery</strong>. This is a huge risk reduction - and a head start for us.</li>
<li>Level of funding. <strong>We're confident we have the funding necessary to open our distillery</strong>, but there is always a risk of unexpected costs and complications. Should we encounter unanticipated costs, it could reduce our ability to be well-prepared for marketing and operations. We're addressing this risk by building in plans for a phase 2 campaign, as well as having backup investors available should we need additional support.</li>
<li>Ingredients and suppliers. Our ingredients are uncommon, difficult to source, and hard to work with. However, our first batches have shown the value of investing in these ingredients - the spirits we produce are unlike anything available today. <strong>We are minimizing supplier risk by purchasing future contracts of key ingredients in advance,</strong> and we're looking to identify backup suppliers.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1510062229/g15b3om5dvfytewfu3sv.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<h3>About Our Perks</h3>
<p>Our perks are a mix of shippable items (such as T-Shirts, Coasters, etc.) and non-shippable (such as reservations or vouchers). <strong>Remember, if you are purchasing perks that include reservations and vouchers, you are not purchasing alcohol </strong>- you are purchasing a voucher (think 'gift card') that can be redeemed in the future at our distillery.</p>
<p>Due to laws restricting the shipment of alcohol, we can't ship anything that contains alcohol. If you purchase a perk that includes a voucher and can't redeem it at the distillery, we'll work with you to figure out the best way for you to legally receive it.</p>
<p>We've had a number of requests to contribute to our campaign with no strings attached. <strong>If you want back Dry Land Distillers but don't want to receive a perk, we encourage you to choose a perk that includes vouchers for our first batch - you can choose to donate your vouchers to our <i>Spirits for the Community</i> campaign. </strong>We'll use the bottles as a fundraiser for local non-profit organizations in 2018. We'll let you know which organization receives your vouchers and make the donation in your name.</p>
<p>Any perks above $50 also includes your signature on our Founder's Wall. Any perks above $400 also gets your name etched onto our whiskey still!</p>
<p>You can make multiple pledges on Indiegogo using a single account. Just make sure you use the same email address and login, so we’ll know that all of your perks are meant to go to the same person. (This applies to any perk).</p>
<p>When you purchase any perk, we will send you an FAQ about our perks with a thank you card.</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We know not everyone can contribute - but that doesn't mean you can't help! <strong>Please spread the word about Dry Land Distillers and our campaign.</strong> The more people that know about us increases our chances for success. </p>
<p>Here are a few ways you can help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ask folks to get the word out - tell your friends, family, and networks.</li>
<li>Visit our <u><strong><a href=""http://www.drylanddistillers.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Website</a></strong></u> and sign up to stay in touch.</li>
<li>Use the Indiegogo share tools to share this campaign with your social media networks - this is really important!</li>
<li>Encourage friends and family to fund our campaign - the spirits we've created are pretty incredible, and supporters will get a chance to try them with our first batches.</li>

We did every bit of the process ourselves - sourcing the ingredients, mashes, fermentations, and distillations. Jason and Sadye let us use their equipment to get our first barrels ready, and we're already hosting tastings of our spirits in their tasting room.
We felt strongly that we wanted to have our first barrels ready in advance of launching our campaign to minimize any risk of production delays on our side.
Our reclaimed aspen wood coasters and t-shirts are already in stock for this campaign - another plus.

The Impact
Your support does more than just help to create a new craft distillery. You'll be supporting the vision for a Longmont community hub. The building we're leasing is one of the oldest historical landmarks in downtown, and will be home to a community co-working space, a live music and arts events venue, and a craft coffee shop and restaurant.
Some key points about our project:

Aaron and Nels are experienced professionals. Aaron is a master brewer and manages lab systems for a biotech company. Nels is an experienced product manager, has started a successful coffee shop, and has a long history working with small distillers in Colorado.
We have compiled a top-notch team to build our distillery, including a leading distillery architectural firm (Dalkita Architecture) and an experienced local contractor (LSE Builders Group).
Our collaboration with Still Cellars has given us a huge head start - our products are already in production. We will have revenue up to nine months earlier than most startup distilleries since we will have products available at our opening.

Risks & Challenges
This is a big project! Starting a craft distillery is hard enough, but we've made it even more complex by designing products that require uncommon ingredients. Seems crazy, but the benefits significantly outweigh the risks.
Here are some things you'll want to evaluate as you look to support our campaign:

Risk to Production. Most craft distillery startups have a long lead time before they have products available. We've mitigated this risk by partnering with Still Cellars. Our first whiskey and prickly pear spirits are recipe-tested and in barrels - so we know we can fulfill our perks! 
New and unproven industry. Craft distilleries are new and are generally unproven. The industry is at a similar point that craft breweries were 20 years ago. We view this as a huge opportunity - getting in early means we have significant upside and growth potential.
Permitting and licensing. Our federal DSP license is in process, and we see no reason that our permit should be delayed; but we won't know for several months. We can't open our distillery without this permit. That's why we've collaborated with Still Cellars to ensure we can legally distill under a federally licensed distillery. This is a huge risk reduction - and a head start for us.
Level of funding. We're confident we have the funding necessary to open our distillery, but there is always a risk of unexpected costs and complications. Should we encounter unanticipated costs, it could reduce our ability to be well-prepared for marketing and operations. We're addressing this risk by building in plans for a phase 2 campaign, as well as having backup investors available should we need additional support.
Ingredients and suppliers. Our ingredients are uncommon, difficult to source, and hard to work with. However, our first batches have shown the value of investing in these ingredients - the spirits we produce are unlike anything available today. We are minimizing supplier risk by purchasing future contracts of key ingredients in advance, and we're looking to identify backup suppliers.

About Our Perks
Our perks are a mix of shippable items (such as T-Shirts, Coasters, etc.) and non-shippable (such as reservations or vouchers). Remember, if you are purchasing perks that include reservations and vouchers, you are not purchasing alcohol - you are purchasing a voucher (think 'gift card') that can be redeemed in the future at our distillery.
Due to laws restricting the shipment of alcohol, we can't ship anything that contains alcohol. If you purchase a perk that includes a voucher and can't redeem it at the distillery, we'll work with you to figure out the best way for you to legally receive it.
We've had a number of requests to contribute to our campaign with no strings attached. If you want back Dry Land Distillers but don't want to receive a perk, we encourage you to choose a perk that includes vouchers for our first batch - you can choose to donate your vouchers to our Spirits for the Community campaign. We'll use the bottles as a fundraiser for local non-profit organizations in 2018. We'll let you know which organization receives your vouchers and make the donation in your name.
Any perks above $50 also includes your signature on our Founder's Wall. Any perks above $400 also gets your name etched onto our whiskey still!
You can make multiple pledges on Indiegogo using a single account. Just make sure you use the same email address and login, so we’ll know that all of your perks are meant to go to the same person. (This applies to any perk).
When you purchase any perk, we will send you an FAQ about our perks with a thank you card.
Other Ways You Can Help
We know not everyone can contribute - but that doesn't mean you can't help! Please spread the word about Dry Land Distillers and our campaign. The more people that know about us increases our chances for success. 
Here are a few ways you can help:

Ask folks to get the word out - tell your friends, family, and networks.
Visit our Website and sign up to stay in touch.
Use the Indiegogo share tools to share this campaign with your social media networks - this is really important!
Encourage friends and family to fund our campaign - the spirits we've created are pretty incredible, and supporters will get a chance to try them with our first batches.

And finally - From all of us at Dry Land Distillers, THANK YOU!Without your support, this journey becomes a lot harder (and a lot less fun).Photo: The entire Dry Land Distillers family (Photo Credit: Luc A.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Uncle Budsy's Barbecue Restaurant</h3>
<p>Uncle Budsy's Barbecue Restaurant has been a local Food Truck company serving public events along with business and private clients in Portland and the surrounding towns for the last 19 years under the name Texas Barbecue. We are establishing a brick and mortar restaurant in the Lloyd District of Portland, Oregon to further capitalize on that history.</p>
<p>Established in 1998, the business has operated a catering kitchen and specialized in full-service catering and event planning for events in the region both at client sites, street fairs and at event spaces and halls. For most events, Uncle Budsy's Barbecue provides referrals to additional vendors, manages client rental equipment needs, and provides event management expertise on the day of the event.</p>
<p>With the legalization of recreational cannabis use in Oregon in 2014, we will be establishing a cannabis friendly restaurant under the name Uncle Budsy's Barbecue. Currently public consumption of cannabis and cannabis infused product is still not legal in Oregon but anticipation for that legalization within the next 5 years is expected. Until that time Uncle Budsy's will be a straight Texas Barbecue Restaurant. In the meantime the release of a Cannabis Cookbook and Infused Barbecue Sauces sold in retail cannabis stores and catered cannabis dinners in a private cannabis lounge here in Portland. These together will allow the connection with the cannabis industry until completely legal.</p>
<p>My name is Michael Davis and I have been a Medical Marijuana Patient for over 3 years but a fan of cannabis since a teenager back in Texas. The advent of legal cannabis here in Oregon has made some tremendous opportunities and challenges in this industry. </p>
<p>Previously, I have been a stockbroker and investment banker with several successful companies. The financial landscape for cannabis businesses has been scattered with some successes but because of the illegal nature at the Federal level many of these businesses are having a difficult time with taxes and banking issues. It is that exact reason we have elected to enter this market as an ancillary, completely legal business.</p>
<p>Uncle Budsy's Barbecue will initially only sell traditional non infused barbecue from the restaurant with cannabis infused products offered through licensed retail cannabis stores. In addition we intend to hold monthly private cannabis dinners at our establishment. This until we can also have cannabis infused products on our public menu.</p>
<p>We intend to merge Uncle Budsy's into a NASDAQ publicly traded company along with our, cannabis friendly hotel - <a href=""http://www.420HolidayHotel.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.420HolidayHotel.com</a> a cannabis lounge <a href=""http://www.420Holiday.club"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.420Holiday.club</a> and our ticket brokerage <a href=""http://www.CannaTixx.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.CannaTixx.com</a></p>

<h3><u>ABOUT THE CHEF</u></h3>
<p>Chef Nicola Blaque has been dreaming of opening a Jamaican Inspired restaurant for over a decade. The Jerk Shack an idea of first-generation Jamaican American, Army Veteran, and now Chef, saw Jamaican food in a different light. Her idea? Delicious Jamaican inspired dishes served to the community. Chef Nicola is launching a new food concept in San Antonio, The Jerk Shack, with dreams of one day expanding the concept across Texas then nation wide.</p>
<p>Chef Nicola will bring the people of San Antonio a new artesian way of Jamaican Inspired cuisine, as well as telling a story based on cultural perspective and history. </p>
<p>They say the chase is better than the catch, so if you’re willing to chase the dream, then join us in building a community and launching San Antonio’s first Jerk Shack.<br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>
<u>FUNDING DETAILS</u> </h3>
<p>With your support, we'll be able to put the money towards the following: </p>
<p>Much-needed Woodburning Charboiler -- Chairs, Tables, Boilers, Burners, Trays, Outdoor renovation, etc.</p>
<p>Marketing Materials -- Signs, Merchandise, Physical &amp; Digital Advertising</p>
<p>R&amp;D -- New Flavors, New Dishes,</p>
<p>Raising $20,000 will allow Chef Nicola to finish small renovations on a historic building in San Antonio along with key kitchen equipment and outdoor lighting. Chef Nicola was very specific about how the Jerk Chicken is prepared and creating the atmosphere of the restaurant with a goal of bringing a similar Jerk Shack from her home in Mandeville, Jamaica keeping it authentic as possible.<br/><br/>When we exceed the goal, funds will be reinvested into The Jerk Shack's second location or a Food Truck. The Jerk Shack has big plans but this is only the beginning. We can't do it without you and looking forward to serving you fresh new Jamaican inspired cuisine. <br/><br/><strong><u>THE PERKS</u></strong> </p>

<p>Chef Nicola and her marketing team made the perks something you can't say no to.

Some LEVELS of perks are set up to INSTANTLY DOUBLE YOUR INVESTMENT at The Jerk Shack. Chef Nicola has give you the option to be the first to try her <strong><i>""Fried Jerk Wings and Mac""</i></strong>  or possible the<strong><i>""Braised Oxtails with rice and peas""</i></strong> . If you want authentic dishes with a new Culinary flare be the first to bite into he <strong><i>""Ackee Saltfish egg rolls"". </i></strong> If being the first to try the food doesn't excite you she has other perks from Jerk Bucks to spend at Jerk Shack and even 20% Lifetime customer discounts. <br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1523614399/mxx4kgjjuf6foyuyarxv.jpg"" src=""""/><br/><br/>If the Jerk Shack misses its goal, the funds will be used and stretched as far as possible to make the best possible launch. It may cause longer wait times without key equipment in the kitchen and the Jerk Shack renovation may be postponed, and we will still continue with offered perks and soft opening party. Chef Nicola is confident her campaign will reach it's goal and excited to make her supporters proud.</p>

<h3><u>Dates</u></h3>
<p><i><b>Soft Opening</b></i> (Founder Only) May 4th starting at 6pm<br/><b><i>GRAND OPENING</i></b> May 11th starting at 6pm </p>
<h3><u>The Impact</u></h3>
<p>San Antonio has recently been recognized as a food capitol, however there is a lack of Jamaican food and the variety of restaurants aren't spread across the map. Chef Nicola is ready to break away from the norm and create her own path. With the lack of Caribbean options in San Antonio she understands there is a want/need/demand for The Jerk Shack. When Chef Nicola Debut the <strong><i>""Jerk Chicken and Pineapple waffle topped with Pineapple relish drizzled with habanero maple syrup and a option of avocado puree and crispy plantain chips""</i></strong> the room was in aww. Needless to say her leaks in the market has been  a major success and she can't wait to go full throttle.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>

</div></div>","ABOUT THE CHEF
Chef Nicola Blaque has been dreaming of opening a Jamaican Inspired restaurant for over a decade. The Jerk Shack an idea of first-generation Jamaican American, Army Veteran, and now Chef, saw Jamaican food in a different light. Her idea? Delicious Jamaican inspired dishes served to the community. Chef Nicola is launching a new food concept in San Antonio, The Jerk Shack, with dreams of one day expanding the concept across Texas then nation wide.
Chef Nicola will bring the people of San Antonio a new artesian way of Jamaican Inspired cuisine, as well as telling a story based on cultural perspective and history. 
They say the chase is better than the catch, so if you’re willing to chase the dream, then join us in building a community and launching San Antonio’s first Jerk Shack. 


FUNDING DETAILS 
With your support, we'll be able to put the money towards the following: 
Much-needed Woodburning Charboiler -- Chairs, Tables, Boilers, Burners, Trays, Outdoor renovation, etc.
Marketing Materials -- Signs, Merchandise, Physical & Digital Advertising
R&D -- New Flavors, New Dishes,
Raising $20,000 will allow Chef Nicola to finish small renovations on a historic building in San Antonio along with key kitchen equipment and outdoor lighting. Chef Nicola was very specific about how the Jerk Chicken is prepared and creating the atmosphere of the restaurant with a goal of bringing a similar Jerk Shack from her home in Mandeville, Jamaica keeping it authentic as possible.When we exceed the goal, funds will be reinvested into The Jerk Shack's second location or a Food Truck. The Jerk Shack has big plans but this is only the beginning. We can't do it without you and looking forward to serving you fresh new Jamaican inspired cuisine. THE PERKS 



Chef Nicola and her marketing team made the perks something you can't say no to. Understanding everyone has a budget and not always able to give money like they would like she tired the perks so you can give where you most comfortable. Some LEVELS of perks are set up to INSTANTLY DOUBLE YOUR INVESTMENT at The Jerk Shack. Chef Nicola has give you the option to be the first to try her ""Fried Jerk Wings and Mac""  or possible the""Braised Oxtails with rice and peas"" . If you want authentic dishes with a new Culinary flare be the first to bite into he ""Ackee Saltfish egg rolls"".  If being the first to try the food doesn't excite you she has other perks from Jerk Bucks to spend at Jerk Shack and even 20% Lifetime customer discounts. If the Jerk Shack misses its goal, the funds will be used and stretched as far as possible to make the best possible launch. It may cause longer wait times without key equipment in the kitchen and the Jerk Shack renovation may be postponed, and we will still continue with offered perks and soft opening party. Chef Nicola is confident her campaign will reach it's goal and excited to make her supporters proud.
 


Dates
Soft Opening (Founder Only) May 4th starting at 6pmGRAND OPENING May 11th starting at 6pm 
The Impact
San Antonio has recently been recognized as a food capitol, however there is a lack of Jamaican food and the variety of restaurants aren't spread across the map. Chef Nicola is ready to break away from the norm and create her own path. With the lack of Caribbean options in San Antonio she understands there is a want/need/demand for The Jerk Shack. When Chef Nicola Debut the ""Jerk Chicken and Pineapple waffle topped with Pineapple relish drizzled with habanero maple syrup and a option of avocado puree and crispy plantain chips"" the room was in aww. Needless to say her leaks in the market has been  a major success and she can't wait to go full throttle.



Risks & Challenges
It'll be challenging to open a Jamaican restaurant in a city where 80% of the people have never tried Jamaican food. The flip side to that coin is once they like it there aren't many Jamaican options in the city. To climb over a few humps Chef Nicola understand exposure is the key and will won't leave no stones unturned in her marketing venture.

Kurzbeschreibung



Wer sind wir? Wir sind ein junges Team von Muslimen  in Graz, der 2. größten Stadt Österreichs, aus verschiedensten Nationen mit einem gemeinsamen Ziel: ""Die Verbreitung der Botschaft des Islams und der Aufklärung.""  


Was machen wir? Wir haben vor kurzem alhamdulillah eine  DAWA- Organisation mit dem Namen: ""TO THE ROOTS"" gegründet mit der Absicht dieser Mission nachzugehen in jeder Art und Form der Dawa, insbesonderer der Streetdawa, der Einladung zum Islam in der Öffentlichkeit.

Warum liegt uns das am Herzen? :


Allah sagt im edlen Quran in der ungefähren Übersetzung:  ""Rufe zum Weg deines Herrn mit der Weisheit und der guten Ermahnung, und streite mit ihnen mit dem, was am besten ist, - dein Herr, Er weiß ja am besten, wer fehlgeht von Seinem Weg, und Er weiß am besten Bescheid über die Rechtgeleiteten. Sura 16 Vers 125  (Ahmad v. Denffer)

What a sustainable, proud way to experience coffee.Our focus is primarily New Zealand, but once successful in the Aotearoa coffee world, we have a long-term vision of expanding to Asia and Australia whilst growing our product offering to include oat-based ice-cream, cheese and cream - it’s time for more dairy-alternatives to become household staples.After completing a competition patent search with James & Wells in Auckland and working with several eco-conscious companies in New Zealand, these raised funds will tremendously help us complete:In this stage, the food technologists at FoodSouth, Christchurch, will take our idea and wish-list to the laboratory to ensure we’ll have a product commercially safe and sound for the market.Indiegogo Fees: 8% + 30p per contribution to graciously allow us to use their crowdfunding platform.If you're willing and able, please may you:

<h3>Gray Jay </h3>
<p>Gray Jay is a passion project. The dream began three years ago when Dominique and Devon decided to open their own restaurant. They didn't know how; they didn't know where; but now they do.  Along the way they met a lot of extraordinary people and one of them was Charles-Eric.  With his ""joie de vivre"" and his natural talent for making people feel completely at ease, he quickly became an essential part of the team! Finally, they found the perfect space: small, cozy and perfectly situated on bustling Preston Street! Since then, they have worked tirelessly to make their dream come true.  They have risen to each new challenge in creating the space - from framing to woodworking, grinding cement to refinishing an antique refrigerator, nothing has dampened their enthusiasm for this new venture.   With the grand opening anticipated for early summer 2019, they need a little help to cross the finish line.  This is where you can make a difference and get involved.   </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We've encountered some unexpected bumps and we need to raise $20,000 to help us finish our project.  Therefore, we are offering an exclusive pre-sale event of the Gray Jay experience.  We had already formed a very special bond with our collaborator Atelier Trema, as well as having started preparing some of the foraged teas that will accompany our dining experience. </p>
<p>You can choose to contribute by taking home simple things like wholesome candles, herbal teas, or going all out and springing for a full evening of dining with us or even wine for a year!! In doing so, you are telling us that YES,  we want to encourage a small restaurant that reinvests in the community by only purchasing local!  YES, we believe in you and want to come for an evening.  YES, we support dreamers,  who dare to create a dining experience that is something completely different for Ottawa,  and play by their own rules.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We at Gray Jay are very conscious of the impact the food industry has on the environment. With climate change reaching a boiling point and contributing to the increasing natural disasters every year (some of us have been flooded out of our homes recently!),  we believe that we need to rethink how to consume for our future to be brighter.  We are committed to 100% Canadian fruit, vegetables and proteins.  Always. We are committed to local farmers and our community and to following the seasons.  We are committed to reinvesting every dollar into small producers that will feed our establishment with what you, the guests, consume.   Over the years we have gotten to know the people who grow and raise our food and we think that the relationships we cherish are the backbone necessary to create a brighter and more sustainable future .  </p>

Most recently, relocating to the central coast to open Solvang Brewing’s new Lompac production facility before calling Brewheim home. Derek is always striving for consistency, quality, and great flavor in a vast array of beer styles.

<p>We've received so many inquiries about our progress and the space itself, and we want to keep you in the loop.</p>
<p><strong>Construction Progress</strong></p>
<p>A month ago in mid-April, our fermenters, brite tanks, mash and lauter tuns were picked up from their sides and raised into place where they will permanently reside. They've been bolted into place and supporting equipment began to be assembled.</p>
<div style=""text-align: center;""><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/e0YkDTaKaZs?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<div>From there, framing, insulation, basic plumbing and electrical have all been completed. After our framing has been inspected, remaining drywall through the facility will be completed.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Steam and glycol lines that keep beers at perfect temperatures throughout the brewing process are being installed as we speak. Gas lines are also going in now. Essentially, the entire brewhouse is ""full steam"" ahead and getting closer to finish.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The next phase will have us installing the iconic grain silo out front of the brewery, and we'll move into the aesthetic portions: interior, finishes, outdoor patio build out, and finally, landscaping. This is just a render, but it should give you an idea of how awesome it's going to be to relax on the patio:</div>

<p>The brewhouse is coming together at rapid pace and literally being bolted and welded into place. It's amazing how fast things come together in the home stretch. Last week, head brewer, Derek Wasak, gave a tour through the facility to show all of the awesome equipment going into our space. <strong>Watch the facility walkthrough:</strong></p>

<h3>FAQ</h3>
<div>We've been taking note of all the incoming questions about the brewery and the Pre-Launch Campaign. We've put them all below, but if you have a question that isn't found here, as always, feel free to reach out.<br/><br/><strong>When is Brewheim opening and what are your hours?</strong><br/>The brewery is opening mid-late summer. We haven't released the concrete grand opening date yet just to add some leeway for final permits and construction bits. You will be sure to hear from us when the day is announced!<br/><br/><strong>Why are you doing the Pre-Launch Campaign?</strong><br/>Simply put: to hook you up. We want to spread the word about Brewheim opening up and reward our early followers with crazy good deals -- more than double your money in some cases. Of course, with the contributions we're able to jump into some cool stuff like small batch releases and new merch a little earlier, but all of that will happen regardless.<br/><br/><strong>Does the Pre-Launch Campaign contribution goal impact opening?</strong><br/>No. Brewheim Beer Makers is deep into development and opening in mere months, no matter what. All of the campaign perks are a ""thank you"" to our early supporters and the contributions let us do cool stuff sooner.<br/><br/><strong>What kind of beers is Brewheim going to make?</strong><br/>All of the beers. We'll have a little bit of it all from your crushable German-inspired lagers to your barrel-aged adjunct imperial stouts and sours. That said, our taps will expand over time as wood-aged beers, collaborations and special releases will gain momentum once we open. We will announce 5 beers that will be on tap for the grand opening in the next week, so keep your eyes peeled.<br/><br/><strong>Will the tap room be dog-friendly?</strong><br/>Yes! We are very dog-friendly and actually have our very own brewery dog, Barley. She's got her own Instagram account (@barleysbuddies) and will be proudly showcasing other Brewheim pups that cruise by.<br/> <h2 style=""text-align: center;"">UPDATE #3 - (6/8/18)</h2>

Our Brewer

Brewmaster Derek Wasak
Our über talented Brewmaster Derek Wasak started his career with Boston Beer Works and Smuttynose on the East Coast before seizing an opportunity to work at Stone Brewing Company. Most recently, relocating to the central coast to open Solvang Brewing’s new Lompac production facility before calling Brewheim home. Derek is always striving for consistency, quality, and great flavor in a vast array of beer styles. Originally hailing from Boston, Derek studied brewing in Munich, Germany at Siebal and is also a certified Cicerone.

Our Founders

Brewheim is the brainchild of Dan Ward and Eric Ferguson. With Dan's extensive background in brew pub ownership and Eric's avid homebrewing, it was a no-brainer for them to come together and create Brewheim.  

Other Ways You Can Help
Not a beer drinker? That's a-ok, I bet you have a family member or friend that is. This is an exceptional gift for the beer enthusiast and casual alike. Why not show someone special how much you love them? 
Additionally, we are so excited to launch, we've created an extra perk called Dollar Beer For A Year. That's right -- 7 lucky Southern Californians will get a $1 beer, per day, for 365 days after we open. All you have to do is be 21+, and live within 100 miles of Anaheim. Check it out!

UPDATE #1 - (5/18/18)
Thank you to all who have already joined the Brewheim Family thus far -- we can't wait to welcome all of you trailblazers through the door and get the taps flowing. You've already secured what's likely to be the best offer on beer we will ever present. Congrats!
We've received so many inquiries about our progress and the space itself, and we want to keep you in the loop.
Construction Progress
A month ago in mid-April, our fermenters, brite tanks, mash and lauter tuns were picked up from their sides and raised into place where they will permanently reside. They've been bolted into place and supporting equipment began to be assembled.

From there, framing, insulation, basic plumbing and electrical have all been completed. After our framing has been inspected, remaining drywall through the facility will be completed.
 
Steam and glycol lines that keep beers at perfect temperatures throughout the brewing process are being installed as we speak. Gas lines are also going in now. Essentially, the entire brewhouse is ""full steam"" ahead and getting closer to finish.
 
The next phase will have us installing the iconic grain silo out front of the brewery, and we'll move into the aesthetic portions: interior, finishes, outdoor patio build out, and finally, landscaping. This is just a render, but it should give you an idea of how awesome it's going to be to relax on the patio:
 

 
Dollar Beer For A Year: Winner #1
You guys are crazy:
 

 
While 2000+ entries is nothing to balk at, it's the smallest that number is going to be with 43 days still left. The chance of winning the most satisfying beer prize ever is highest early on, so good luck to you early birds. Some of you are doing serious work enlisting your friends, getting 10+ entries. Bravo.

<p>We are Cory and Jaclyn Yates, proud owners of Jersey Bagels. When we met in Houston 6 years ago our first conversation was about New Jersey. The east coast way of life runs deep in our family. With this comes a greater appreciation for authentic east coast staples, one of those staples being bagels. Great food has always been a passion of ours as we spend many hours either in the kitchen or trying local restaurants. We jumped at the opportunity to create Jersey Bagels once we realized we could combine our passion for food with our roots. Having the opportunity to serve the community while doing something we love is beyond humbling. Achieving our campaign goal will allow us to fully embark on our mission of spreading authentic New Jersey style bagels across the greater Houston area, starting with Northwest Houston. </p>

<h3>How You Can Help</h3>
<p>By reaching our goal we will be able to rent a commercial kitchen, purchase a food truck and establish a strong presence at local markets and food truck parks. We have received quotes for all necessary equipment to set up our food truck thus leading to our $60,000 goal. If we don't reach our goal then we will use all funds raised to rent a commercial kitchen and purchase supplies to set up a booth at several local markets. We won't be able to reach our goal without your support and with your support comes some pretty cool perks. The perks may differ but they all come with our genuine appreciation for your contribution. Whether we fill your wardrobe with a fresh Jersey Bagels shirt or your belly with some delicious bagels, we will be dishing out some pretty cool perks that you will want to get your hands on.</p>

<p>The need for a different, quick, affordable and delicious breakfast/brunch/lunch establishment in our area is evident. Although quick and delicious, its safe to say the donut and kolache scene in Houston is flooded. That is where we come in. Whether providing something new to our native Texans or helping our east coast transplants get a taste of back home, Jersey Bagels will offer customers something hard to find in this area. We will offer flavors of the month to keep things interesting as well as frequent giveaways and discounts. We realize there aren't many opportunities like the one we have right now. That is why we are all in and willing to go the extra mile to make Jersey Bagels an even bigger success.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Chasing our dreams can be fulfilling but it comes with its challenges and risks. As much as we pride ourselves on our east coast roots, presenting this style of food in Houston has its disadvantages. East coast staples are somewhat foreign to Southerners, but it won't take long for everyone to understand the hype around Jersey Bagels. We decided to test the market by launching our operation out of our home. Needless to say the operation was a huge success and the market for Jersey Bagels is rather large. The restaurant business can be expensive and repairs to major equipment are always around the corner. We have witnessed this firsthand. With this experience comes the realization that a small portion of funds raised will need to be set aside for future equipment repairs. That way if any speed bumps come our way we won't miss a beat. We have also networked with local restaurant owners and obtained an adviser thus ensuring some business guidance along the way. </p>

<h3>We need your help!</h3>
<p>After spending many years as a corporate stooge, and rarely being able to utilize my true talents and doing something I am super passionate about, Robin (my wife and much better half) and I are starting a distillery.</p>
<p>Our backgrounds vary from Engineering, Biology and business with skills in sales and management. I love to make things and I love to cook. Most importantly Robin and I are huge fans of whiskeys and gins.</p>
<p>This venture is very important to Robin and I. We want something that is ours that we build from the ground up that makes a product that can be enjoyed by everyone. Well, everyone of legal drinking age...</p>
<p>Our distillery is located in Pocatello, Idaho. We have started buying equipment but we need  more, and we'll need operating capital to get things up and running.</p>
<p><strong>How are we different?</strong></p>
<p>We are not a super big mass production distillery. Not that there is anything wrong with super big, mass production distilleries; I enjoy some pretty big named Bourbons after all. </p>
<p>Much like small wineries and micro breweries have done in the past, the micro distillery industry is taking off. Consumers want small batch liquors that are made by hand in a simple copper still, as there is a clear difference in the taste and quality of these libations. </p>
<p>Moonlight Mountain Distillery is also committed to supporting local farmers. Utilizing ingredients from local sources decrease transport costs and environmental impact and is just good business for everyone involved. We also take special care with waste to ensure our spent grains go to local farmers for feed and that we properly treat our used water before it returns to the city for treatment.</p>
<p><strong>What we need:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Our 126 gallon copper still has been partially funded but we need to be able to get it out of hock when it's complete.</li>
<li>We need a 200 gallon mash tun.</li>
<li>We need capital for electrical and plumbing work.</li>
<li>We need working capital to buy ingredients and hardware as the business starts.</li>
</ul>
<p>As soon as all of these items are secured, we will be ready for business. If we are not able to raise all of the funds, we will use what we do raise as equity for a SBA loan.</p>
<p><strong>What is our distillery making you ask?</strong></p>
<p>Happy to tell you. We will produce gins and whiskeys with a couple different liqueur varieties. </p>
<ul>
<li>High Desert Gin - Refreshing and light, perfect in a cocktail or for sipping. The base is made from 100% barley and the botanicals will be gathered locally. These local flavors will allow the drinker to experience the terroir and aromas of the Idaho desert without having to leave your favorite bar stool.</li>
<li>Coffee Liqueur - This liqueur will be partnered with a cold brew coffee from our local roaster here in Pocatello. Don't expect a syrupy sweet drink, but a smooth, rich coffee flavored delight.</li>
<li>Snake River Rum - Idaho is not in the Caribbean, but this rum will be available in clear and dark varieties, and will impress you with the taste and complexity.</li>
<li>Cranberry Gin - This will be our high desert gin with a bit of Oregon cranberries infused, and barrel rested. The mixed drink options are endless.</li>
<li>Whiskey - American Single malt whiskey to rival the national spirit of Scotland. </li>
<li>Howlin' Rabbit Bourbon - Our flagship drink (because I enjoy bourbon over the rest) that will be made with a locally grown heirloom corn to be aged the appropriate time for one of the best bourbons outside Kentucky. </li>
<li>Thievin' Magpie whiskey - this will be a young whiskey made entirely of several locally grown ancient grains. </li>
</ul>

Our distillery is located in Pocatello, Idaho. We have started buying equipment but we need  more, and we'll need operating capital to get things up and running.
How are we different?
We are not a super big mass production distillery. Not that there is anything wrong with super big, mass production distilleries; I enjoy some pretty big named Bourbons after all. 
Much like small wineries and micro breweries have done in the past, the micro distillery industry is taking off. Consumers want small batch liquors that are made by hand in a simple copper still, as there is a clear difference in the taste and quality of these libations. 
Moonlight Mountain Distillery is also committed to supporting local farmers. Utilizing ingredients from local sources decrease transport costs and environmental impact and is just good business for everyone involved. We also take special care with waste to ensure our spent grains go to local farmers for feed and that we properly treat our used water before it returns to the city for treatment.
What we need:

Our 126 gallon copper still has been partially funded but we need to be able to get it out of hock when it's complete.
We need a 200 gallon mash tun.
We need capital for electrical and plumbing work.
We need working capital to buy ingredients and hardware as the business starts.

As soon as all of these items are secured, we will be ready for business. If we are not able to raise all of the funds, we will use what we do raise as equity for a SBA loan.
What is our distillery making you ask?
Happy to tell you. We will produce gins and whiskeys with a couple different liqueur varieties. 

High Desert Gin - Refreshing and light, perfect in a cocktail or for sipping. The base is made from 100% barley and the botanicals will be gathered locally. These local flavors will allow the drinker to experience the terroir and aromas of the Idaho desert without having to leave your favorite bar stool.
Coffee Liqueur - This liqueur will be partnered with a cold brew coffee from our local roaster here in Pocatello. Don't expect a syrupy sweet drink, but a smooth, rich coffee flavored delight.
Snake River Rum - Idaho is not in the Caribbean, but this rum will be available in clear and dark varieties, and will impress you with the taste and complexity.
Cranberry Gin - This will be our high desert gin with a bit of Oregon cranberries infused, and barrel rested. The mixed drink options are endless.
Whiskey - American Single malt whiskey to rival the national spirit of Scotland. 
Howlin' Rabbit Bourbon - Our flagship drink (because I enjoy bourbon over the rest) that will be made with a locally grown heirloom corn to be aged the appropriate time for one of the best bourbons outside Kentucky. 
Thievin' Magpie whiskey - this will be a young whiskey made entirely of several locally grown ancient grains.

<h3>Who Are We?</h3>
<p>2 years ago, My wife and I moved to Cincinnati, Oh from Nashville, Tn. </p>
<p>We decided on Cincinnati because we have family close by or in the city. We decided on Price Hill because there is an Ecovillage there, (Enright Urban Ecovillge). We love the village and are excited to be using the vegetables from Urban Earth Farms as well as selling their produce at the Shop. We want to be able to give back to not just Enright Ecovillage but to the Price Hill Community at large. </p>
<p>We have had a long road to Cincinnati.  Both Blair and Scott we raised in central IL then met in Chicago and moved to Nashville TN only to settle in Cincinnati.  Scotts' history with food is a vast.  He grew up visiting his family of farmers and then worked in a meat processing and catering plant that his parents opened.  After learning production and butchery he moved to the restaurant world where he worked in BBQ, pizza, deli's seafood and more.   In Nashville,  after helping move one restaurant to a new location and manage the opening and development of a new restaurant, we have decided to start a project of our own. Scott has worked in several kitchens over his professional career all the while missing something.  He yearns to have creative freedom and get quality healthy (and not so healthy but oh so delicious) meals to individuals and communities that deserve them.   Common Roots is a venue that will allow us to be creative but also show the respect to the community around us that deserves it.  It will be a community corner where all are treated as family.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We cannot accomplish this program alone.  We your help we will be able to get the kitchen up to code for the city of Cincinnati.  We will be installing an updated grease trap, hood system and new equipment that will allow us to cook in a wide range of methods.  </p>
<p>We hope to offer a community corner where we can facilitate a wide rand of events that put the community first.  This could be as simple as an outlet to express local arts and music or as complicated as providing a space for future projects to hold fundraisers.  We plan to have profit share nights where we can help organizations that are already doing great things for the community gain support and visability.  These organizations are including and not limited to Price Hill Will, Santa Maria House and Imago Earth. </p>
<h3>New Projects Come with Risks</h3>
<p>This is a new concept and something new for this community.  Price Hill has a lack of healthy food and a lack of forward thinking business's within the community.  Our plan is to create a sustainable business that used sustainable healthy food.  Not all of the community will be ready for these products but we plan on making this as accessible to the public as possible.  We also plan on making the space a fun and safe place for all the neighborhood to enjoy.  We want to have free all ages movie nights for the youth in the community.  We want our courtyard to be a place for anyone to come enjoy and play in.  With your help we can be a safe corner for our neighborhood to feel comfortable and grow in.  </p>

<p><strong>BOY MEETS GIRL</strong></p>
<p>Our story began in Harlem six years ago when Milka and I (Romeo) met at Awash. I was new to the city, arriving from Paris as a film intern and looking for a part time gig. She was the manager at her mom's Ethiopian restaurant. It was love at first sight. A whirlwind romance led to wedding bells months later and an opportunity to take over the Awash in Cobble Hill. It was a scary venture but we knew that together we had what it  took to succeed- Milka had been working in the restaurant industry for over a decade, honing her managerial skills. I have an immense love and passion for  cooking and for people-as a child, I would often help my mom create amazing dishes for family and friends. We were a formidable match. After several weeks of renovation and a revamp to our menu, we reopened as Awash Brooklyn. From cooking to cleaning to waiting tables and bartending, we did (and continue to do) it ALL.  <strong>It was through hard work and dedication that we have been able to make Awash Brooklyn a premier destination for classic Ethiopian cuisine and culture. </strong> </p>
<p><strong>STARTING OVER</strong></p>
<p>This project is very personal to us for several reasons. For starters, Awash has laid the foundation for our desire for entrepreneurship. We have an immense passion for our culture, for its people and food. Our existing space has allowed us to create our interpretation of what the Ethiopian cultural experience is, one that is centered around a sense of community and fellowship. Secondly, Awash has extended our knowledge of food- Milka and I have come to appreciate the importance of providing clientele with  the best quality food and ingredients. Our newest venture, namely Ras, will serve as a marriage of these precedents. Located in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, <strong>Ras will be the first organic locally sourced farm to table plant based Ethiopian restaurant  in NYC (locally sourced as much as possible)</strong>. Our desire for a vegan menu stems from  our own personal journey and transition towards a plant based lifestyle. Riddled with a multitude of health issues, both Milka and I veered away from conventional medicine and instead looked into how what we eat can have its own transformative effects. The Ras menu is a culmination of the knowledge that we’ve acquired, put thoughtfully into every ingredient, every  menu item, every single detail.  It is our contribution to helping our clientele and community eat better to feel better. Our research has also helped us to understand the importance of  sourcing food, which is why we have opted to work exclusively with local farms. Buying local not only provides fresher, healthier options but is actually better for the environment as well. <strong>Ras will do its share in leaving a small ecological footprint- from sourcing food to energy, we will make conscious decisions today that affect tomorrow and beyond.</strong></p>
<p><strong>OUR VISION </strong></p>
<p>In addition to being the first farm to table Ethiopian restaurant in NYC, the Ras menu will offer traditional vegan cuisine as well as a variety of new options that includes stews and salads. Similarly, our weekend brunch  will feature the classic fare as well as a good selection of  Ethio-American fused alternatives. Our bar will offer everything from signature cocktails to beers, wines and kombucha on tap. Live events throughout the week will showcase talent from near and far. Aesthetically, Ras will emulate a garden, bringing the beauty of Mother nature indoors.  <strong>From our carefully curated food and beverage menus to our large art murals, Ras will strive to represent Ethiopian culture the best way we know how- in a fresh, modern way while staying true to our roots.</strong></p>
<p><b>WHAT WE NEED</b></p>
<p><strong>Ras will be a perfect addition to the growing, culturally diverse Crown Heights area.</strong>   Our success thus far has been driven by the support of our community, family and friends. This campaign is no different. We have found the perfect home for Ras at 739 Franklin Ave. but it is currently an empty concrete box in need of a lot of work. Having functioned as a bar prior to us, we would need to get the space up to code with city regulations as well as build out the entire bar, dining and kitchen area.<strong> We are looking to raise $100,000 to help alleviate some of the construction costs. 100% of funds raised through this campaign (be it more or less than our intended goal) will go directly into creating a space worthy of our amazing clientele</strong>. Below is a rough breakdown of how much this project will cost in its entirety:</p>
<p><strong>Architect/Expediting fee</strong>-$23,500 <br/><strong>Build out</strong> - $198,800<br/><strong>Equipment -</strong>$41,745.47<br/><b>Furniture</b><strong> and fixtures - </strong>$20,000 (estimate)<br/><strong>Legal fees/Liquor License -</strong>$28,000<br/><strong>TOTAL ESTIMATED COST: $312,045.47</strong><br/> </p>
<p><strong>HOW YOU CAN HELP</strong></p>
<p>Milka and I have taken a huge leap of faith with this project-the lease has been signed, hard hats are on and construction is underway. BUT in all honesty, we don't have the entire amount needed to bring Ras to life. We have usurped our saving and maxed out our credit cards. After several NO's, we finally got approved for a loan (YES!!) but it only covers a third of our estimated build out costs. Call us crazy (we kind of are!!) but its a testament to how much we believe in ourselves and our vision. <strong>And now we are turning to YOU to help us make Ras a reality. </strong>Family, friends, loyal customers- we’re talking about you!! You have witnessed first hand how our hard work and dedication has made Awash a go to spot in Downtown Brooklyn. We ask that you put that same faith into us to jumpstart Ras. <strong>Be it through monetary pledges or simply sharing this campaign with someone you know, every bit helps us get one step closer to our goal.</strong> Thank you in advance!<br/> </p>

</div><div><h3> </h3></div></div>","BOY MEETS GIRL
Our story began in Harlem six years ago when Milka and I (Romeo) met at Awash. I was new to the city, arriving from Paris as a film intern and looking for a part time gig. She was the manager at her mom's Ethiopian restaurant. It was love at first sight. A whirlwind romance led to wedding bells months later and an opportunity to take over the Awash in Cobble Hill. It was a scary venture but we knew that together we had what it  took to succeed- Milka had been working in the restaurant industry for over a decade, honing her managerial skills. I have an immense love and passion for  cooking and for people-as a child, I would often help my mom create amazing dishes for family and friends. We were a formidable match. After several weeks of renovation and a revamp to our menu, we reopened as Awash Brooklyn. From cooking to cleaning to waiting tables and bartending, we did (and continue to do) it ALL.  It was through hard work and dedication that we have been able to make Awash Brooklyn a premier destination for classic Ethiopian cuisine and culture.  
STARTING OVER
This project is very personal to us for several reasons. For starters, Awash has laid the foundation for our desire for entrepreneurship. We have an immense passion for our culture, for its people and food. Our existing space has allowed us to create our interpretation of what the Ethiopian cultural experience is, one that is centered around a sense of community and fellowship. Secondly, Awash has extended our knowledge of food- Milka and I have come to appreciate the importance of providing clientele with  the best quality food and ingredients. Our newest venture, namely Ras, will serve as a marriage of these precedents. Located in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, Ras will be the first organic locally sourced farm to table plant based Ethiopian restaurant  in NYC (locally sourced as much as possible). Our desire for a vegan menu stems from  our own personal journey and transition towards a plant based lifestyle. Riddled with a multitude of health issues, both Milka and I veered away from conventional medicine and instead looked into how what we eat can have its own transformative effects. The Ras menu is a culmination of the knowledge that we’ve acquired, put thoughtfully into every ingredient, every  menu item, every single detail.  It is our contribution to helping our clientele and community eat better to feel better. Our research has also helped us to understand the importance of  sourcing food, which is why we have opted to work exclusively with local farms. Buying local not only provides fresher, healthier options but is actually better for the environment as well. Ras will do its share in leaving a small ecological footprint- from sourcing food to energy, we will make conscious decisions today that affect tomorrow and beyond.
OUR VISION 
In addition to being the first farm to table Ethiopian restaurant in NYC, the Ras menu will offer traditional vegan cuisine as well as a variety of new options that includes stews and salads. Similarly, our weekend brunch  will feature the classic fare as well as a good selection of  Ethio-American fused alternatives. Our bar will offer everything from signature cocktails to beers, wines and kombucha on tap. Live events throughout the week will showcase talent from near and far. Aesthetically, Ras will emulate a garden, bringing the beauty of Mother nature indoors.  From our carefully curated food and beverage menus to our large art murals, Ras will strive to represent Ethiopian culture the best way we know how- in a fresh, modern way while staying true to our roots.
WHAT WE NEED
Ras will be a perfect addition to the growing, culturally diverse Crown Heights area.   Our success thus far has been driven by the support of our community, family and friends. This campaign is no different. We have found the perfect home for Ras at 739 Franklin Ave. but it is currently an empty concrete box in need of a lot of work. Having functioned as a bar prior to us, we would need to get the space up to code with city regulations as well as build out the entire bar, dining and kitchen area. We are looking to raise $100,000 to help alleviate some of the construction costs. 100% of funds raised through this campaign (be it more or less than our intended goal) will go directly into creating a space worthy of our amazing clientele. Below is a rough breakdown of how much this project will cost in its entirety:
Architect/Expediting fee-$23,500 Build out - $198,800Equipment -$41,745.47Furniture and fixtures - $20,000 (estimate)Legal fees/Liquor License -$28,000TOTAL ESTIMATED COST: $312,045.47 
HOW YOU CAN HELP
Milka and I have taken a huge leap of faith with this project-the lease has been signed, hard hats are on and construction is underway. BUT in all honesty, we don't have the entire amount needed to bring Ras to life. We have usurped our saving and maxed out our credit cards. After several NO's, we finally got approved for a loan (YES!!) but it only covers a third of our estimated build out costs. Call us crazy (we kind of are!!) but its a testament to how much we believe in ourselves and our vision. And now we are turning to YOU to help us make Ras a reality. Family, friends, loyal customers- we’re talking about you!! You have witnessed first hand how our hard work and dedication has made Awash a go to spot in Downtown Brooklyn. We ask that you put that same faith into us to jumpstart Ras. Be it through monetary pledges or simply sharing this campaign with someone you know, every bit helps us get one step closer to our goal. Thank you in advance! 

PERKS
We are well aware that the best things in life aren't free, which is why we've compiled a great list of incentives for every pledge tier. From lunch at our new location to private cooking classes to shutting down our restaurant for a 100 person event, we've covered all grounds. Check out our perks below!

<h3 style=""margin-left:160px;"">Here's What We Have Going On</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>We are <strong><i>so excited</i> </strong>to offer downtown Bluefield, Virginia a new option in their morning routine!</p>
<p>My name is Collin O'Donnell, founder of 'The Grind'. I'm a 26 year old college student, veteran, and entrepreneur. I'm looking to share my love of coffee &amp; bagels with downtown Bluefield, Virginia and create a space for the community to gather in social events, while offering a unique &amp; comfortable space for everyone to enjoy themselves.</p>
<p>The proposed space at 103 Spring Street, Bluefield, Virginia 24605, is currently owned by the city who will be conducting a large scale renovation to the property within the coming months. We are looking to take up between 1200 and 1400 square feet and offer a dynamic space that will invite all members of the community in as family. Our unique floor plan will include:<br/><strong>- A lending library</strong></p>
<p><strong>-Televisions, gaming and couches</strong></p>
<p><strong>-Traditional seating</strong></p>
<p><strong>-An express lane for coffee grabbers who need to get in and get out </strong></p>
<p>As we look to invite the community in with everything we do, we will hold events such as 'bake off's', book and philosophy clubs, college nights, public engagements and much more.</p>
<p><strong>We can't wait</strong> to invite the community in to try our rewards and discount programs that will be the first of its kind in the area, and we aren't done yet! 'The Grind' will fit in perfectly<strong> </strong>with Appalachia; on the inside, a warm wood accent invites the spirit of fall even in the middle of winter, while on the outside, our semi-enclosed patio space will allow you to enjoy the cool, spring breeze of the Appalachian mountains in-between the soul-warming coffee you're enjoying.</p>
<p>-</p>
<h2><strong><u>What We Need &amp; What You Get</u></strong></h2>
</div><div>
<p>The city will be doing an extensive renovation, but this does not cover everything to include both mechanical and aesthetic aspects, nor the necessary cash flow needed for a start up in our industry. We will also need to purchase equipment which, in estimates gathered during the course of our business plan, could run upwards of $30,000. Currently we have personal capital of $25,000 guaranteed.</p>
<p>In order to raise funds and pitch our idea, 'The Grind' took part in the Tazewell County business challenge for startups to pitch their idea for a shot at a $5,000 dollar grant to use towards equipment. Winners will be announced December 3rd, 2019. <i><u> <a href=""https://youtu.be/gJtRCNbYY40"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The pitch can be viewed  here or under our header slides, above. Skip to the 22:00 minute mark of the video to see our official pitch!</a></u></i></p>

<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Overview</span></h3>
<p>Our vision is twofold: experience coffee and strengthen community.</p>
<p>We are Cabrona Coffee, a place where blending traditional Mexican flavors, ingredients, and culture creates a memorable coffee-drinking experience for everyone to enjoy. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1573511910/ksuokacmmlmkhywr8kvz.png"" src=""""/></h3>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Why is Cabrona Coffee Necessary?</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Everyone deserves a space where they feel welcomed and understood. We have personally felt disappointed by not having enough coffee shops in Denver that are Latino-owned. We know we're not the only ones wanting something more than the average neighborhood coffee shop.</p>
<p>We want to create a place where Mexican culture is translated into a coffee-drinking experience. This is what we are building. Cabrona Coffee is the place where the Latino community of Denver can find themselves and a community of like-minded folks in a neighborhood coffee shop.</p>
<p>We are opening Cabrona Coffee because Latino coffee drinkers matter: our stories, our experience, our community, and our dollars. It is a space for those who love coffee, music, and a good time.</p>
<h3>Become a Madrina or a Padrino</h3>
<p>Want to help make this space a reality? We need your help to bring this space to life! Starting a business is a life-changing experience. Just like other major life events where Padrinos step in to support with time and money, this business endeavor is no different. We are asking family, friends, and the broader community to help us build something new.</p>

<h3>Why Our Name? </h3>
</div><div>
<p>""Why not?"" is usually our first response. As a woman-owned business, we embrace empowerment and culture by reclaiming a name that has been used for far too long against women who think for themselves and who live life to the fullest. Latinas-regardless of their background-can immediately identify with the word <i>cabrona</i> and claim it as their own. With Latinas growing influence as consumer dynamos and empowered activists, we can manifest our values by supporting businesses who understand us best.</p>
<h3>Our Offer</h3>
<p>Cabrona Coffee is much more than a coffee shop. We are on a mission to strengthen and support our community by becoming a neighborhood hub. Here are just a few reasons why we exist:</p>
<ul>
<li>Representation: Brown ownership is vital to us. It's how we build wealth and roots for generations to come. </li>
<li>Memorable Experiences: We want you and those you care about to feel welcome and have a good time in our space.</li>
<li> Responsibility: We believe ownership brings responsibility. We are in a position to be stewards of the money you spend. Your dollar supports other small businesses with a similar focus and values as ours.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Okay, Opening a Coffee Shop is Risky...</h3>
<p>We are a business, and like any business, we have a certain amount of risk. But here are a few things that make us different:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cabrona Coffee leads the competition by serving incomparable signature beverages, baked goods, and light food items in a setting culturally appropriate to the area and its historical roots of the neighborhood. We provide an informal and cultural coffee house ambiance with a contemporary flair.</li>
<li>The Spanish language is an essential part of the ambicultural (100% fluent in more than one culture) nature of many. Latino consumers actively seek out in-culture media content and Spanish-language conversations online, in music, on television, and in conversations with friends and family. Cabrona Coffee is intentional with the language used by our staff, signage, and on our website. We understand how important it is for us to use English, Spanish, and Spanglish as a cultural connector. </li>
</ul>

</div><p> </p></div>","Overview
Our vision is twofold: experience coffee and strengthen community.
We are Cabrona Coffee, a place where blending traditional Mexican flavors, ingredients, and culture creates a memorable coffee-drinking experience for everyone to enjoy. 
 
 

 
Why is Cabrona Coffee Necessary?

Everyone deserves a space where they feel welcomed and understood. We have personally felt disappointed by not having enough coffee shops in Denver that are Latino-owned. We know we're not the only ones wanting something more than the average neighborhood coffee shop.
We want to create a place where Mexican culture is translated into a coffee-drinking experience. This is what we are building. Cabrona Coffee is the place where the Latino community of Denver can find themselves and a community of like-minded folks in a neighborhood coffee shop.
We are opening Cabrona Coffee because Latino coffee drinkers matter: our stories, our experience, our community, and our dollars. It is a space for those who love coffee, music, and a good time.
Become a Madrina or a Padrino
Want to help make this space a reality? We need your help to bring this space to life! Starting a business is a life-changing experience. Just like other major life events where Padrinos step in to support with time and money, this business endeavor is no different. We are asking family, friends, and the broader community to help us build something new.
 
Our current reality:

 

 
 
OUR FUTURE :


Why Our Name? 

""Why not?"" is usually our first response. As a woman-owned business, we embrace empowerment and culture by reclaiming a name that has been used for far too long against women who think for themselves and who live life to the fullest. Latinas-regardless of their background-can immediately identify with the word cabrona and claim it as their own. With Latinas growing influence as consumer dynamos and empowered activists, we can manifest our values by supporting businesses who understand us best.
Our Offer
Cabrona Coffee is much more than a coffee shop. We are on a mission to strengthen and support our community by becoming a neighborhood hub. Here are just a few reasons why we exist:

Representation: Brown ownership is vital to us. It's how we build wealth and roots for generations to come. 
Memorable Experiences: We want you and those you care about to feel welcome and have a good time in our space.
 Responsibility: We believe ownership brings responsibility. We are in a position to be stewards of the money you spend. Your dollar supports other small businesses with a similar focus and values as ours.


Okay, Opening a Coffee Shop is Risky...
We are a business, and like any business, we have a certain amount of risk. But here are a few things that make us different:

Cabrona Coffee leads the competition by serving incomparable signature beverages, baked goods, and light food items in a setting culturally appropriate to the area and its historical roots of the neighborhood. We provide an informal and cultural coffee house ambiance with a contemporary flair.
The Spanish language is an essential part of the ambicultural (100% fluent in more than one culture) nature of many. Latino consumers actively seek out in-culture media content and Spanish-language conversations online, in music, on television, and in conversations with friends and family. Cabrona Coffee is intentional with the language used by our staff, signage, and on our website. We understand how important it is for us to use English, Spanish, and Spanglish as a cultural connector. 


Our Supporters/Padrinos/Madrinas Help Us:
We value each of our supporters. Every. Single. Dollar. Matters.  We are at the start of construction and the many needs that will soon follow. From building bathrooms to painting our walls, your dollars will be used to bring our space to life.

Speaking of walls, we will add the name of every contributor to our special wall of appreciation. We believe everyone at every level should be recognized.

In 2017, downtown Mebane was named a Top 5 Great Place in NC.

Within a year, Scott took over as Head Brewer before leaving to obtain a formal brewing education through the Master Brewer Program at the Siebel Institute.
