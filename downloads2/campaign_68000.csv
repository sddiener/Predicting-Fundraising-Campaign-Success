<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Our Mission Statement: </h3>
<p>Belchertown Justice Collaborative is a youth-led group that was formed in response to the murder of George Floyd to start anti-racist action and conversations in our own community. We recognize that racism is systemically built into institutions such as schools, the healthcare system, law enforcement, and government. We are dedicated to being a part of the action and conversation that examines, dismantles, and rebuilds these systems in Belchertown. We do this through education, policy change, research and data collection, forming connections with other local organizations and activists, and proposing new frameworks. We will change town culture to be more accessible, inclusive, and equitable for Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC). In our work, we strive to recognize, acknowledge, and convey intersecting identities and oppressions. Community is the backbone and starting place of all important change, and we are committed to doing this work with people and in places that make up home for us.<strong> Today, we are asking for your help funding our next projects so that we can get work supporting our community</strong>. </p>

Not-for-Profit privately funded veteran’s center located at 5536 S King Dr, Chicago, IL 60637. The two owners, Arnetha Gholston and Daniel Habeel fund the center with all of
their own personal income, equating to over 90% of the monthly expense.Open 7 days a week 360 days a year,
our mission is to Remake The World (RTW) beginning with the community that we
are located in and then spreading into other neighborhoods. We serve veterans
and their families, the general public, and the youth by offering twelve
different programs that operate out of the center.We're different from any other
veteran center in the country that we know of in existence. Opening in February
of 2011 with a commitment that any veteran or anyone else who came to our doors
hungry “Would Not Leave Hungry” we became a forward operating base (FOB) in the
war against poverty, drugs, gangs, crime, violence, and terrorism in the
community.  The center serves over 4,000 free meals per month to
Chicago's more than 8,000 homeless veterans and others.
We're Hurting. During the coldest time of the year, our furnaces failed and the subzero winter quickly froze our pipes. Pipes ruptured throughout the building causing water damage and making the repair job much more difficult. While volunteers were able to get our furnace back up, the irreversible damage has put the center on a path towards closure.
What
We Need
We have never needed support as much
as we need it now. We need just over $10,000 to fix the damage to our pipes and
structure that occurred so we can get back up and running at 100%. The workers
are ready but we have to purchase supplies and equipment for getting crucial work done. Once done, the work has to pass inspection.What You'll Get100% of the current donations we get go towards the center so we don't have a lot to offer. We've adjusted our fundraising to offer some perks that will be ordered once we raise enough money. For those offering $25 or more you'll get a center photo from the Veteran Center Staff. For $100 or more, you'll get a T-Shirt in addition to the photo. For supporters offering $1,000 or more in a donation gets a sweatshirt in addition to the t-shirt and photo.The RTW Veteran Center is supported by multiple organizations and many hundreds of individuals and it's growing everyday.           If you can't donate to our Campaign then Please spread the word.

<h3>A Safe House for Mexico's Journalists?</h3>
<p>Mexico is infamous for being <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/05/03/the-most-common-punishment-for-killing-a-journalist-in-mexico-nothing/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">one of the most dangerous countries in the world to be a journalist</a>.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/29/world/americas/veracruz-mexico-reporters-killed.html?_r=0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Authorities fail to protect journalists</a> and at-risk and threatened reporters have nowhere to flee in safety.</p>
<p>That means Mexico's threatened journalists have to rely on the kindness of friends, family, colleagues or non-governmental organizations. It's not an ideal situation -- for the threatened journalists or the people close to them.</p>
<p>These informal support networks are often overwhelmed by the special dilemmas presented by a persecuted journalist. At-risk reporters often return to the place where they confront danger, or, they flee to places within Mexico that are not real places of refuge.</p>
<p>Tragic examples of a Failure to Find Safe Refuge:</p>
<p>- Photojournalist <a href=""http://www.sinembargo.mx/01-08-2015/1435603"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Rubén Espinosa</a> fled Xalapa, Veracruz for Mexico City in 2015 where he could not find a permanent place to stay. On 1 August 2015 gunmen killed Espinosa and four women in the apartment of one of his friends in Mexico City.</p>
<p>- Acapulco reporter <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/28/us-asylum-immigration-mexico-reporter-journalist-martin-mendez-pineda"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Martín Méndez Pineda</a> fled the State of Guerrero after being threatened by police. He reported moving around Mexico from place to place, always feeling threatened. Early in 2017 he crossed the U.S.-Mexico border in El Paso and applied for asylum in the United States. Immigration authorities in the U.S. denied him asylum and he returned to Mexico where he fears for his safety.</p>
<p>- <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/19/opinion/to-die-would-be-to-stop-writing.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Javier Valdez</a>, author of nine books, veteran journalist, and one of the founding editors of newspaper <i>RíoDoce<i>, </i></i>confronted worsening threats in Culiacán, Sinaloa throughout 2017. Although he tried to leave Culiacán, a colleague reported he had no funds to go into exile and so returned to Sinaloa. He was murdered on May 15 in broad daylight.</p>
<h3>Finding a Solution: Asking Journalists What They Want</h3>
<p>One conclusion to be drawn from these examples -- and there are other examples, too -- is that an independent safe house might provide refuge for at risk journalists. If modeled on other safe houses for journalists around the world -- for example in Paris and Cádiz, Spain -- a refuge in Mexico would give a threatened reporter time away from terror, allowing them to receive professional attention (psychological, legal, and work-related), so that they can make a decision about what to do next. (<a href=""http://lajornadasanluis.com.mx/opinion/refugios-periodistas-tristeza/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The only known safe house in Mexico is not independent</a>. Opened late last July, it is funded by the government of Mexico City.)</p>
<p>But it's impossible to know, as yet, if a house of refuge for Mexican journalists would work in their favor. Why? Nobody has ever asked them.</p>
<p>Over the past six years, as I've documented threats against reporters in Mexico, I've met many at-risk journalists in Veracruz, Chihuahua, Sinaloa, and Mexico City who all intimate the need for a house of refuge, independent of government influence. It's time to listen to these journalists about the support network they need.</p>
<p>The situation is urgent. As the crisis deepens, help me find out what reporters go through as they do their necessary work, and what their experiences suggest will help keep them safe. Do they want a place of refuge? And if so, what services do they know they will require?</p>
<h3>The Campaign's Goals and Can I Achieve Them?</h3>
<p>Since late 2011, I have provided human rights accompaniment to journalists in several Mexican states. For the past five years, I've been doing this work pro-bono. Getting to know and sharing experiences with Mexican journalists has enabled me to advocate for them through writing, publishing, and presentations, spreading the word about ongoing challenges to freedom of expression in Mexico.</p>
<p>This campaign to document what Mexican journalists want to keep them safe will result in:</p>
<p><strong>1. a series of stories about how they practice journalism;</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. a longer report based in human rights norms; and,</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. presentation of the report to foundations and stakeholders interested in practical steps to defend freedom of expression in Mexico.</strong></p>
<h3>Previous Examples of My Work</h3>
<p>You can see examples of my reporting about Mexican journalists for the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) as a Guest Blogger, <a href=""https://cpj.org/blog/2014/04/unprecedented-response-to-mexican-journalists-murd.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>; and, as a freelance reporter for the website of the North American Congress on Latin America NACLA, <a href=""http://nacla.org/news/2016/09/14/every-journalist-mourns-dead-journalist"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a> and <a href=""http://nacla.org/news/2017/05/31/life-imitating-news-murder-mexican-journalist-javier-valdez"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>; the pro-bono <a href=""https://mexicanjournalismtranslationproject.wordpress.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Mexican Journalism Translation Project</a> (which I edit), and the <a href=""http://sites.sandiego.edu/tbi-foe/2016/12/12/mexican-human-rights-update-news-veracruz-patrick-timmons/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Freedom of Expression Project</a> at the Trans-Border Institute at the University of San Diego.

<p>I am technically qualified to produce a human rights report on this subject. In 2013, I was awarded a Master of Laws (LLM) degree in International Human Rights Law from the University of Essex, UK. I wrote <a href=""http://encore.essex.ac.uk/iii/encore/record/C__Rb1874600?lang=eng"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">a state-of-the-art thesis</a> on the protection gaps for journalists in international human rights law.

<p>I have a PhD in Latin American History from the University of Texas at Austin (2004). From 2015 to 2017, I have served as Lecturer in History at El Paso Community College, a position that has enabled me to publish articles on the history of the <a href=""http://nacla.org/news/2017/03/27/trump%27s-wall-nixon%27s-border"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">border</a> and <a href=""http://nacla.org/news/2017/05/03/terrorizing-undocumented-el-paso"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">immigration enforcement</a> with NACLA.</p>
<h3>My Background as a Human Rights Investigator</h3>
<p>After I obtained my doctorate in Latin American history and worked as a university professor for a few years, I moved to Mexico City to work for a drug policy non-profit. After a year of that work, an opportunity arose to work as a Human Rights Policy Officer at a European Union member delegation embassy in Mexico City.</p>
<p>That official experience provided me with a network of journalists and human rights activists in Mexico, and especially in Veracruz. It also exposed me to the inner workings of Mexico's state and federal governments, gave me key contacts in Mexico's federal human rights protection agencies, and has helped me understand the importance to democracy and civil society of local journalists who wage a fundamental fight against corruption, impunity and violence.</p>
<p>Since 2011 I have visited Veracruz more than a dozen times. I travel to Veracruz to interact with journalists, hear what challenges they face, and try to ascertain how things have improved or worsened for them. I have based myself in Mexico City when I do this work, also as a way to stay connected to journalists in the capital and in other states.</p>
<p>I am committed to working on the ground with journalists in Mexico. Documenting violations of freedom of expression through field work helps to combat impunity for reporters' murders and disappearances because it establishes a record that can be used for future action. Accompanying living journalists is also an attempt to protect their freedom of expression and earn their trust.</p>
<h3>Hard Tacks: Human Rights Field Work Costs</h3>
<p>But human rights accompaniment and documentation comes at a price. It's not hefty, but it's not something my academic position at a community college in Texas can support. It's that simple. To do this work of protecting journalists, I need your help.</p>
<p>I can only document these journalists' experiences with your financial support. Eventually, I will seek foundation support for the safe house, but right now this work of investigating informal methods of protection is urgent, necessary, and can be done for very little cost -- if you are willing to share just part of the burden. Together we can start to find practical, workable approaches to protecting Mexican journalists.</p>

</div><div> </div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>For reasons of personal security and the safety of my sources and collaborators, the specific itinerary of places to visit and people to interview cannot be disclosed. That will come out in the stories and the report, with consent from key sources, or publishing with pseudonyms.</p>
<p>Many people think that what I do is risky. In actual fact, the risk comes to the people who are my contacts and sources. Therefore, one of the key strategies is always to work in a way that respects what the journalists want as they manage the risks confronting them, preserving their anonymity if they want it preserved, or helping them establish contacts inside and outside of Mexico that can keep them safe.</p>

Return airfare from El Paso/Juárez to Mexico City ($500)Bus travel throughout cities in Veracruz ($500)Mexico City Preparation Two Weeks ($400)Veracruz, 4 Weeks In the Field ($650)Mexico City Draft Writing Week ($250)Cell Phone & Newspapers ($200)
Total Request: $2,500
Impact: Stories, the Human Rights Report, Pitching Foundations
Stories
Taking stock through human rights documentation and journalism about what motivates journalists to become reporters willing to risk their lives in the context of the drug war will help English-language readers better understand the enormity of commitment to freedom of expression in Mexico. We also need a better understanding of the informal ways in which journalists seek to protect themselves, what actions have worked for them and not worked for them. The ReportThis will be a larger, more analytical presentation of what journalists report will keep them safe, will help shape the practical attempt to keep journalists alive, out of harm's way, and with their human rights intact. The Pitch to Foundations and StakeholdersOnce I have documented the ways journalists keep themselves safe and what they say they need,  I will use the stories and the report to seek funding for establishing a safe house. The safe house must address the specific needs identified by Mexico's journalists but it must also be independent, hence the need to pitch foundations interested in protecting freedom of expression.
 
Risks & Challenges
For reasons of personal security and the safety of my sources and collaborators, the specific itinerary of places to visit and people to interview cannot be disclosed. That will come out in the stories and the report, with consent from key sources, or publishing with pseudonyms.
Many people think that what I do is risky. In actual fact, the risk comes to the people who are my contacts and sources. Therefore, one of the key strategies is always to work in a way that respects what the journalists want as they manage the risks confronting them, preserving their anonymity if they want it preserved, or helping them establish contacts inside and outside of Mexico that can keep them safe.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>The Anti-Homosexuality Act of 2014 sparked unprecedented levels
of intolerance, aggression, and persecution for LGBT folks across Uganda. While
the homophobic and transphobic legislation has since been repealed, another anti-gay
bill is in the works, and many have lost their jobs, been kicked out of their homes, or forced into hiding. As politicians, religious leaders, and media outlets continue to circulate LGBT intolerance for selfish gains, the lives of our Ugandan LGBT brothers and sisters have become increasingly precarious. </p>

<p><b>Kasha Jacqueline</b>, one of the founders of

She knew that a misguided perception of diversity as a “sickness”, “western import”

their religious leaders or politicians may say).</p>
<p>Kasha collected dozens of stories and printed the first edition
of ""Bombastic Magazine"" in record time. She cut costs every way she
could, editing the text herself and brokering deals with printers who took the

<h3>What's Going On...</h3>
<p>We're Nilufa and Xyannie, 2 juniors from NYC iSchool and we're trying to go to the first ever annual one week <a href=""http://www.soapboxinc.com/feminist-day-camp/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Soapboxinc Feminist Day Camp.</a> After taking Global Feminism this year, our really awesome teacher, Ms. Jenkins, who taught the course, encouraged us both to enroll in it. It is the perfect opportunity for us both to continue that feminist fire that kindled within us when we first took the course. We are both really excited about it and determined to go, but the only thing holding us back was the price.</p>
<h3>In Case You Didn't Know..</h3>
<p>Feminism is the social justice movement to gain equality between men and women. Unlike common misconceptions, it isn't about misandry or refusing to make your boyfriend a sandwich. It's about equal pay and opportunity. It's about wearing whatever I'd like and behaving as I'd like without being called any slurs. It's about respect.</p>
<h3>Feminist Camp...</h3>
<p>Is a camp where feminists can gather and, in our case, inspire the next generation of feminists. Over the course of one week, high schoolers from around the country, maybe even the world, will work together in workshops, discussions and tackle an issue regarding the theme of that day. That way we can touch upon all issues within feminism.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need...</h3>
<p>The entire original price for the camp is $1000 a person. But we already live in New York, so Ms. J was able to get us a really awesome low rate of $250 per person. That means we'd need $500 for us both to go.</p>
<p>$500 will get us both</p>
<ul>
<li>a metro card for the entire week</li>
<li>lunch and dinner for the week</li>
<li>and a really awesome opportunity to hone our leadership skills and meet inspiring activists!</li>
</ul>
<p>If we don't reach the goal, whatever money we do raise will be split between us to pay for our enrollment. </p>
<p>If we happen to pass the goal, the extra money will probably pay for any extra stuff not included in the price to attend the camp.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact...</h3>
<p>Global Feminism was one class that left an impact greater than all the other classes we've taken in school. We were introduced to issues that we were astounded to believe were actual issues like honor killings and sex trafficking. This chance to go to the camp would be such a stellar opportunity to continue what we learned, to keep that flame alive. For the first time ever, we've been introduced to something we care about and are thrilled about and actually want to pursue. </p>
<p>We'd be meeting a bunch of women who have experience in activism. We'd be surrounded by other kids our age who share our interest. We will get to give to our school what we have learned and maybe inspire the next generation of NYC iSchool students to attend next year. We would both come back from this camp stronger and more firm in our beliefs. We'll be courageous enough to destroy the patriarchy!</p>
<p>It will be an experience we will both treasure.</p>

<p>It started with one person… and now a group
of friends have shown up to help cook and deliver meals for the past 14 years –
the first year, 28 homeless were fed! The next year more showed up and over
fifty meals went out. The following year we reached the 100 mark and
fast-forward to last year when we were able to feed over 10,000 homeless across
multiple cities in the USA.</p>
<p>Gobble Gobble Give has become an incredible
example of what a community can do to make change. If you are reading this, you
have been invited to join us!</p>
<p><b><u>WE NEED
YOUR HELP</u></b></p>
<p>This year GGG is making a bid to reach out
to more cities and to help more people.<span> 
But we need your help first!</span></p>
<p>We’re using IndieGoGo to raise money for
our annual multi-city potluck.<span>  Gobble
Gobble Give is a 501c3 non-profit and all funds go towards providing food,
supplies, and any relevant facility costs to those that host our event.  Anything left over just rolls into the next
year.</span></p>
<p>Every Thanksgiving we try to expand our
ability to help feed the homeless, and every Thanksgiving we’re floored by the
outreach of support (from our on-the-day volunteers to the companies that donate
their goods to clothe the homeless).<span> 
This year we think we can do even more!</span></p>
<p><b><u>THE NITTY
GRITTY</u></b></p>
<p>We’re asking for $10,000 from the
community.</p>
<p>We are able to scrape by each year with a
few thousand dollars in our collective budget, and we’ve reached maximum bang for
our buck.<span>  With your support we can
expand our operation to cover the costs of including more cities and providing
more food and supplies to those in need. 
</span></p>
<p>Funds that we raise go into a GGG general
fund that we use to buy supplies and food for each location hosting a potluck
event on Thanksgiving.<span>  </span></p>
<p><b><u>THE ‘NOT SO
SECRET’ SECRET</u></b></p>
<p>Helping to feed and clothe someone over the
holidays is an amazing experience.<span>  The
person in need receives some love and support, yes, but the real transformative
experience comes from the volunteers that give their time and energy to step
away from their holiday obligations to help others.  We’ve seen friendships form and lives change
with one service. </span></p>
<p>If and when GGG can expand, this experience
can be offered not only on Thanksgiving, but throughout the year!</p>
<p><b><u>BUT
WAIT, THAT’S NOT ALL</u></b></p>
<p>In exchange for helping fund an amazing
event, we’re offering a unique set of perks that are as diverse and eclectic as
our GGG family.  From a permanent thank-you on our website to a deluxe spa package courtesy of The Raven Spa, golfing with Billy Zane (yes this is for real) and even a signed catalogue by Ed Ruscha! Please see what perk level strikes your fancy.  If you really want to be a rockstar (or at least prepare meals next to one), come join in on the fun for a couple of hours on Thanksgiving morning!<br/></p>

<br/><p></p></span></span></span></span></div>","It started with one person… and now a group
of friends have shown up to help cook and deliver meals for the past 14 years –
the first year, 28 homeless were fed! The next year more showed up and over
fifty meals went out. The following year we reached the 100 mark and
fast-forward to last year when we were able to feed over 10,000 homeless across
multiple cities in the USA.
Gobble Gobble Give has become an incredible
example of what a community can do to make change. If you are reading this, you
have been invited to join us!
WE NEED
YOUR HELP
This year GGG is making a bid to reach out
to more cities and to help more people. 
But we need your help first!
We’re using IndieGoGo to raise money for
our annual multi-city potluck.  Gobble
Gobble Give is a 501c3 non-profit and all funds go towards providing food,
supplies, and any relevant facility costs to those that host our event.  Anything left over just rolls into the next
year.
Every Thanksgiving we try to expand our
ability to help feed the homeless, and every Thanksgiving we’re floored by the
outreach of support (from our on-the-day volunteers to the companies that donate
their goods to clothe the homeless). 
This year we think we can do even more!
THE NITTY
GRITTY
We’re asking for $10,000 from the
community.
We are able to scrape by each year with a
few thousand dollars in our collective budget, and we’ve reached maximum bang for
our buck.  With your support we can
expand our operation to cover the costs of including more cities and providing
more food and supplies to those in need. 

Funds that we raise go into a GGG general
fund that we use to buy supplies and food for each location hosting a potluck
event on Thanksgiving.  
THE ‘NOT SO
SECRET’ SECRET
Helping to feed and clothe someone over the
holidays is an amazing experience.  The
person in need receives some love and support, yes, but the real transformative
experience comes from the volunteers that give their time and energy to step
away from their holiday obligations to help others.  We’ve seen friendships form and lives change
with one service. 
If and when GGG can expand, this experience
can be offered not only on Thanksgiving, but throughout the year!
BUT
WAIT, THAT’S NOT ALL
In exchange for helping fund an amazing
event, we’re offering a unique set of perks that are as diverse and eclectic as
our GGG family.  From a permanent thank-you on our website to a deluxe spa package courtesy of The Raven Spa, golfing with Billy Zane (yes this is for real) and even a signed catalogue by Ed Ruscha! Please see what perk level strikes your fancy.  If you really want to be a rockstar (or at least prepare meals next to one), come join in on the fun for a couple of hours on Thanksgiving morning!


KEEP CALM
AND GIVE ON
Gobble Gobble Give offers the potluck event
for volunteers every year.  If you can’t
donate, spread the word and better yet come help out! 
This year we plan to host potluck events in
the following cities on Thanksgiving:


Los Angeles, CA - Echo Park

Los Angeles, CA - Santa Monica
Harlem, NY

San Francisco, CA

Austin, TX

Nel cosiddetto sud nel mondo ma anche in alcuni paesi industrializzati, da bene comune liberamente accessibile l’acqua si trasforma in bene privato o controllato da chi detiene il potere. Sotto la spinta della crescente domanda d’acqua dovuta all’ aumento della popolazione e alla crescita industriale dei paesi in via di sviluppo e sotto la morsa del cambiamento climatico, sempre più visibile nella nostra quotidianità l’acqua diventa fonte di conflitto, bene scarso per cui è fondamentale accaparrarsene,  a spese del vicino.<br/><strong>________________________________________________________________________</strong></p><p><strong><i>Water grabbing</i> </strong>or<strong> </strong>“water hoarding” refers to a situation in which powerful actors, public or private, are able to take control of or reallocate precious water resources for their own benefit, at the expense of local communities and ecosystems on which the communities’ livelihoods are based. Families driven from their villages to make room for mega dams, privatization of water sources, water pollution from industrial purposes that benefit few and harm the entire ecosystem. In what some call the world’s south, but also in some industrialized countries, water is transformed from a freely accessible common good to a private good controlled by those in power. Pressure mounts as the demand for water continues to grow because of increasing population, industrial growth in developing countries and the grip of climate change over our daily lives. Water is becoming a source of conflict and a scarce commodity that those in power hoard, even at the expense of others close by.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1491321780/dugugqm9ja3nv8ohkd2e.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><strong>COME DENUNCIARE QUESTO FENOMENO?</strong></p><p>Un pool di giornalisti (<strong>Emanuele Bompan</strong>), fotografi (<strong>Gianluca Cecere, Thomas Cristofoletti, Fausto Podavini</strong>), cartografi (<strong>Federica Fragapane e Riccardo Pravettoni</strong>) e ricercatori (<strong>Marirosa Iannelli</strong>, Università di Genova), ha iniziato a lavorare da 10 mesi su questo tema per mostrare a cittadini e policy maker come l’acqua e il watergrabbing stiano diventando i driver di nuovi conflitti e di ingiustizia diffusa.

Nel cosiddetto sud nel mondo ma anche in alcuni paesi industrializzati, da bene comune liberamente accessibile l’acqua si trasforma in bene privato o controllato da chi detiene il potere. Sotto la spinta della crescente domanda d’acqua dovuta all’ aumento della popolazione e alla crescita industriale dei paesi in via di sviluppo e sotto la morsa del cambiamento climatico, sempre più visibile nella nostra quotidianità l’acqua diventa fonte di conflitto, bene scarso per cui è fondamentale accaparrarsene,  a spese del vicino.________________________________________________________________________Water grabbing or “water hoarding” refers to a situation in which powerful actors, public or private, are able to take control of or reallocate precious water resources for their own benefit, at the expense of local communities and ecosystems on which the communities’ livelihoods are based. Families driven from their villages to make room for mega dams, privatization of water sources, water pollution from industrial purposes that benefit few and harm the entire ecosystem. In what some call the world’s south, but also in some industrialized countries, water is transformed from a freely accessible common good to a private good controlled by those in power. Pressure mounts as the demand for water continues to grow because of increasing population, industrial growth in developing countries and the grip of climate change over our daily lives. Water is becoming a source of conflict and a scarce commodity that those in power hoard, even at the expense of others close by.COME DENUNCIARE QUESTO FENOMENO?Un pool di giornalisti (Emanuele Bompan), fotografi (Gianluca Cecere, Thomas Cristofoletti, Fausto Podavini), cartografi (Federica Fragapane e Riccardo Pravettoni) e ricercatori (Marirosa Iannelli, Università di Genova), ha iniziato a lavorare da 10 mesi su questo tema per mostrare a cittadini e policy maker come l’acqua e il watergrabbing stiano diventando i driver di nuovi conflitti e di ingiustizia diffusa. Grazie al Centro di Giornalismo Europeo (EJC) siamo riusciti a realizzare una parte di questo lavoro.

<h2><strong>With Dance for Equality of Gender and Races</strong></h2>
<h3><u>My background</u></h3>
<p>With Croatian origins but born in Switzerland, I am living with people from different cultures my whole life. I travelled throughout Europe, India, Cuba… and I dance since childhood. Furthermore, my father is an internationally recognised sexologist and meditation teacher. By growing up in a spiritually and socially very engaged family I realised that, to change the society we have to change ourselves first.</p>
<p>This summer (08/17) I will successfully finish my two bachelors in Indology and Pedagogy. Through many different dance styles, schools and dance pedagogues I have learnt a lot about diversity in dance. Now I am passing this knowledge to my own dance group <i>Só Dança</i>. In 2014 I have invented an “Afrolatin” course for the sports program of the University of Zagreb and was leading it for six semesters (until March 2017). The program is continued under the guidance of my student and successor Silvija Musić.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1497003132/oglxcgqrldv4u6kht51p.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Throughout the years I have learnt that when we dance, we are all equal. Everyone surrendering to the rhythm and movement gets into some kind of flow. There is no place or time for hate, aggression, discrimination. No one is thinking if the dancer beside is a woman or a man, or if they have a different skin-colour. We are just one shining, vibrant heart!</p>
<p>For this reason I called my dance group <i>Só Dança </i>which in Portuguese means “Only dance”.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><u>Project</u></h3>
<p><strong>I will open a mobile institute/organisation whose main work will be the organisation of festivals, which will promote two main life-goals: equality of gender and equality of races. </strong></p>
<p>I mainly dance Bollywood (India), African (modern and traditional) and Latin-American dances (couple-dances like Salsa, Bachata, as well as Reggaeton, Samba, Brasil funk). In the beginning, using these styles, I want to bring the Indian, African and Latin-American culture closer to the European and vice versa (and later include also all other world cultures). To get deeper knowledge of contemporary dance as well as of other dances, starting in January 2018 I will apply to diverse dance-academy’s in Switzerland, Germany, Austria, the Netherlands… From October on I will work 8 months in Zürich, Switzerland to earn some money and at the same time prepare myself for all those auditions.</p>
<p><strong>It is exactly through dance that we can meet and understand each other better because every culture is expressing through dance its ethnic values and soul contents. Expressing what for them is most important.</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1497002300/pjduyljbupxpjsvralew.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>When the project (institute) gets alive I want to expand it on all other cultures worldwide and invite guest dancers with cultural and psychological knowledge. Just as well I want to create a positive climate between women and men, with emphasis on gender equality. Love and harmony between genders is my wish and my vision. At the age of 16 I was acting in Medulin, Croatia, in the Vagina Monologue play, written by Eve Ensler. At the age of 18 (2013) I organised for the first time in Pula, Croatia, the One Billion Rising (OBR) protest. OBR is a dance flash mob against violence on women (invented by Eve Ensler). I organised this event for three consecutive years in Pula (see more: link). Related to that, I held also a presentation about violence on women for elucidation (germ. Aufklärung) of the students of the Gymnasium of Pula. Furthermore, during my studies I have held diverse seminars about feminism and gender equality. Occasionally I translate books with <i>Aufklärung</i> and sexuality issues.</p>
<p>You, <strong>Supporters</strong>, are helping me to make this vision become reality! Your financial support will help me to work and at the same time to devote myself completely to the realisation of our common vision: equality of gender and races. (Teaching, organising small projects and starting with preparations for the first Só Dança festival.)</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>What I give &amp; what I get</strong></h3>
<p><u>What I give:</u></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><u>dance classes and shows</u></strong></li>
<li><strong>scientific lectures</strong></li>
<li><strong>cultural workshops</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Through dance, every folk is expressing its values, soul content, tradition, that’s exactly the reason why you can get to know each other (cultures) better through dance.</p>
<p>Today in a world full of problems with the integration of immigrants and asylum seekers and also problems concerning gender equality the <i>Só Dança</i> institute will be a new way where we will learn about people who are different from us, hear their stories and make friends with them through the medium of dance. Also learn to understand the other sex, try to see from his or her perspective and make peace between each other. A new way to understand mankind.</p>
<p>Só Dança will be a mobile institute, which will travel around Europe (and wider) and organise festivals with different cultures and gender issues as their main topic. The central medium for learning and understanding will be <strong>dance</strong>.  However, there will be also <strong>scientific lectures </strong>held by sociologists, sexologists, anthropologists and others as well as small <strong>cultural workshops</strong> (for example production of traditional African food and jewellery, how to wear a saree, I as a woman - I as a man, gender workshops with refugee women etc.).</p>
<p>The institute will organise festivals but also collaborate with similar organisations and give workshops for them.</p>

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1497002353/pjax8dthi4nhpbvsf1dg.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>By presenting cultures to each other, <i>Só Dança</i> will take care of traditions and emphasise the traditional version of a dance, along with encouraging creativity. It should be clear how a dance traditionally looks like but we want to free dancers minds too. There is no right and wrong when you dance. There is no “it has to be like that” when you dance. I want to create a dance-world free of prejudices, free of rules. Inspire dancers to think outside the “how-it’s-supposed-to-be box”, design your own language, combine different dance-styles: for example use Hip Hop and contemporary while dancing Salsa and so on.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><u>What I get - financial support for:</u></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>dance education</strong></li>
<li><strong>preparations and establishing of the <i>Só Dança</i> institute/organisation</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>With financial help during my work in Switzerland I can continue with my previous activities and dedicate my full time and energy for <strong>the establishing of the institute and organising a first festival </strong>(in Summer 2018), which will embody the ideas of Só Dança.</p>
<p><strong>1. Life support (per month)</strong><br/>200 EUR rental fee<br/>400 EUR food<br/>100 EUR public transport<br/>500 EUR dance classes 5days a week<br/>100 EUR pocket money</p>
<p>TOTAL: 1300 EUR x 8 months = <strong>10’400 EUR</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. Establishing of the institute/first festival support</strong><br/>For the establishing of the institute and the organisation of a first festival I will need about – 50 000 EUR depending on how big the festival will be, how many guests teachers and cultural workshops I will have and so on.<br/>7000 EUR hall rental<br/>5000 EUR flights and accommodation of artists/professors<br/>4000 EUR drinks and catering team<br/>2000 EUR photographers and camera-men<br/>2000 EUR technical equipment team<br/>14’000 EUR promo company<br/>Etc.<br/> </p>
<h3><u>What happens if I don't reach my funding-goal?</u></h3>
<p>The project will be realised sooner or later. I am here, my team is here, the idea is here and we are already working on the project. <i>Só Dança</i> is and will happen. Let us work together for a better world! Help us to work immediately!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><u>Who will attend the festivals?</u></h3>
<p>Everyone. Youth, adults, dancers and non-dancers.</p>
<p>The festivals will be open for everyone above 16. There will always be dance classes for different levels: beginner, medium, advanced.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><u>Why is my project important for you, supporters, and the world?</u></h3>
<p>All of us want to live in a peaceful and joyful world. Nowadays we are far away from these ideals. It is enough to mention the problems with ISIS, hate against Moslems, problems with refugees and their integration into the European countries, or the prejudices and more or less hidden discrimination towards Africans, Asians and all other “strangers“ who come to our countries. And the problem of the non-equal rights between men and women, which is present the most of the time in human history in all nations and cultures.</p>
<p>In this world full of ignorance, intolerance, lack of love, compassion and knowledge, we need more projects like <i>With Dance for Equality of Gender and Races</i>, who will, in a peaceful, educative and amusing way, get people more close to each other and let them <strong>lively experience our unity in diversity</strong>. Make them understand that we can live all together despite all the differences. <strong>Let</strong> them live together for those few moments. It will open their minds and hearts.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Some more reasons why to support us:</p>
<ul>
<li>for some people it is easier to learn through practical experience and not only lectures, that’s why I want to use dance as a medium of learning</li>
<li>for people who don’t have the possibility to travel and meet other cultures in that way, <i>Só Dança</i> would bring other cultures to them</li>
<li>every religion says the same: we should be good people and help each other</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>We need <i>Só Dança</i>, everyone dancing together in the rhythm of mother Earth’s heartbeat!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><u>Similar projects which I already realised</u></h3>
<p>All that is already existing in my life and, as I already mentioned above, I had some other projects, where <i>Só Dança</i>’s vision was making the first steps in this world:</p>
<ol>
<li value=""NaN"">I was the initiator, main organiser and dancer of the first <strong>One Billion Rising</strong> protest against violence on women in Pula, Croatia (see more: link)) from 2013-2015</li>
<li value=""NaN"">I held a <strong>presentation about violence on women</strong> for elucidation (germ. <i>Aufklärung</i>) of students of the Gymnasium of Pula</li>
<li value=""NaN"">During my studies I held diverse <strong>seminars about feminism and gender equality</strong>
</li>
<li value=""NaN"">In 2014 I invented the <strong>“Afrolatin” course </strong>in the sports program of the University of Zagreb and was leading it for three school-years (since march 2017, the program is continued under the guidance of my student and successor Silvija Musić)</li>
<li value=""NaN"">In 2014 I founded my <strong>own dance group </strong><strong><i>Só Dança</i></strong> with which I perform on diverse dance-events in whole Croatia as well as abroad; several performances on cultural-events for the Indian Embassy in Zagreb, Department of Indology and Far Eastern Studies, Zagreb etc.</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<p><u>Ideas for dance classes:</u></p>
<ul>
<li>Different dance styles with historical background stories</li>
<li>couple-dances with switching roles,</li>
<li>ladies styling to free the woman’s passion, make them feel beautiful in their bodies, make them love their bodies and show their passion and femaleness through dance</li>
<li>also for men – breaking prejudices about men who can’t move</li>
<li>girls dancing with girls, men with men</li>
</ul>
<p>We want to create a network of people in whole Europe (and wider), so that this festival becomes something stable and after some time we would open institutes in other countries. Also create a program for primary and secondary schools, also universities where already children would learn about different cultures and dance from small on, dance also with the other sex, learn that we are different and love the difference.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><u>Why me?</u></h3>
<ol>
<li value=""NaN"">People say that I have charisma and positive influence on people</li>
<li>I already do and live all what I explained above and I am determined to continue doing it in a more professional and sophisticated way, in order to spread my message and my method to wider audiences</li>
<li value=""NaN"">I am raised in a multicultural family as also in multicultural surroundings</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<h3><u>Other ways to help</u></h3>
<ol>
<li value=""NaN"">
<strong>Share our project on social media</strong> and call on people who maybe could help also financially</li>
<li value=""NaN"">If you know other ways than Facebook/website/direct e-mails to share and promote our project – please give us suggestions!</li>
<li value=""NaN"">Send us suggestions of people/institutions who could be interested in our project</li>
<li value=""NaN"">New ideas, inputs – just write us J</li>
<li value=""NaN"">Please <strong>recommend us to potentially influential people/institutions</strong>

It is exactly through dance that we can meet and understand each other better because every culture is expressing through dance its ethnic values and soul contents. Expressing what for them is most important.

When the project (institute) gets alive I want to expand it on all other cultures worldwide and invite guest dancers with cultural and psychological knowledge. Just as well I want to create a positive climate between women and men, with emphasis on gender equality. Love and harmony between genders is my wish and my vision. At the age of 16 I was acting in Medulin, Croatia, in the Vagina Monologue play, written by Eve Ensler. At the age of 18 (2013) I organised for the first time in Pula, Croatia, the One Billion Rising (OBR) protest. OBR is a dance flash mob against violence on women (invented by Eve Ensler). I organised this event for three consecutive years in Pula (see more: link). Related to that, I held also a presentation about violence on women for elucidation (germ. Aufklärung) of the students of the Gymnasium of Pula. Furthermore, during my studies I have held diverse seminars about feminism and gender equality. Occasionally I translate books with Aufklärung and sexuality issues.
You, Supporters, are helping me to make this vision become reality! Your financial support will help me to work and at the same time to devote myself completely to the realisation of our common vision: equality of gender and races. (Teaching, organising small projects and starting with preparations for the first Só Dança festival.)
 
What I give & what I get
What I give:

dance classes and shows
scientific lectures
cultural workshops

Through dance, every folk is expressing its values, soul content, tradition, that’s exactly the reason why you can get to know each other (cultures) better through dance.
Today in a world full of problems with the integration of immigrants and asylum seekers and also problems concerning gender equality the Só Dança institute will be a new way where we will learn about people who are different from us, hear their stories and make friends with them through the medium of dance. Also learn to understand the other sex, try to see from his or her perspective and make peace between each other. A new way to understand mankind.
Só Dança will be a mobile institute, which will travel around Europe (and wider) and organise festivals with different cultures and gender issues as their main topic. The central medium for learning and understanding will be dance.  However, there will be also scientific lectures held by sociologists, sexologists, anthropologists and others as well as small cultural workshops (for example production of traditional African food and jewellery, how to wear a saree, I as a woman - I as a man, gender workshops with refugee women etc.).
The institute will organise festivals but also collaborate with similar organisations and give workshops for them.
To read more about dance classes scroll down.

By presenting cultures to each other, Só Dança will take care of traditions and emphasise the traditional version of a dance, along with encouraging creativity. It should be clear how a dance traditionally looks like but we want to free dancers minds too. There is no right and wrong when you dance. There is no “it has to be like that” when you dance. I want to create a dance-world free of prejudices, free of rules. Inspire dancers to think outside the “how-it’s-supposed-to-be box”, design your own language, combine different dance-styles: for example use Hip Hop and contemporary while dancing Salsa and so on.
 
What I get - financial support for:

dance education
preparations and establishing of the Só Dança institute/organisation

With financial help during my work in Switzerland I can continue with my previous activities and dedicate my full time and energy for the establishing of the institute and organising a first festival (in Summer 2018), which will embody the ideas of Só Dança.
1. Life support (per month)200 EUR rental fee400 EUR food100 EUR public transport500 EUR dance classes 5days a week100 EUR pocket money
TOTAL: 1300 EUR x 8 months = 10’400 EUR
2. Establishing of the institute/first festival supportFor the establishing of the institute and the organisation of a first festival I will need about – 50 000 EUR depending on how big the festival will be, how many guests teachers and cultural workshops I will have and so on.7000 EUR hall rental5000 EUR flights and accommodation of artists/professors4000 EUR drinks and catering team2000 EUR photographers and camera-men2000 EUR technical equipment team14’000 EUR promo companyEtc. 
What happens if I don't reach my funding-goal?
The project will be realised sooner or later. I am here, my team is here, the idea is here and we are already working on the project. Só Dança is and will happen. Let us work together for a better world! Help us to work immediately!
 
Who will attend the festivals?
Everyone. Youth, adults, dancers and non-dancers.
The festivals will be open for everyone above 16. There will always be dance classes for different levels: beginner, medium, advanced.
 
Why is my project important for you, supporters, and the world?
All of us want to live in a peaceful and joyful world. Nowadays we are far away from these ideals. It is enough to mention the problems with ISIS, hate against Moslems, problems with refugees and their integration into the European countries, or the prejudices and more or less hidden discrimination towards Africans, Asians and all other “strangers“ who come to our countries. And the problem of the non-equal rights between men and women, which is present the most of the time in human history in all nations and cultures.
In this world full of ignorance, intolerance, lack of love, compassion and knowledge, we need more projects like With Dance for Equality of Gender and Races, who will, in a peaceful, educative and amusing way, get people more close to each other and let them lively experience our unity in diversity. Make them understand that we can live all together despite all the differences. Let them live together for those few moments. It will open their minds and hearts.
 
Some more reasons why to support us:

for some people it is easier to learn through practical experience and not only lectures, that’s why I want to use dance as a medium of learning
for people who don’t have the possibility to travel and meet other cultures in that way, Só Dança would bring other cultures to them
every religion says the same: we should be good people and help each other

 
We need Só Dança, everyone dancing together in the rhythm of mother Earth’s heartbeat!
 
Similar projects which I already realised
All that is already existing in my life and, as I already mentioned above, I had some other projects, where Só Dança’s vision was making the first steps in this world:

I was the initiator, main organiser and dancer of the first One Billion Rising protest against violence on women in Pula, Croatia (see more: link)) from 2013-2015
I held a presentation about violence on women for elucidation (germ. Aufklärung) of students of the Gymnasium of Pula
During my studies I held diverse seminars about feminism and gender equality

In 2014 I invented the “Afrolatin” course in the sports program of the University of Zagreb and was leading it for three school-years (since march 2017, the program is continued under the guidance of my student and successor Silvija Musić)
In 2014 I founded my own dance group Só Dança with which I perform on diverse dance-events in whole Croatia as well as abroad; several performances on cultural-events for the Indian Embassy in Zagreb, Department of Indology and Far Eastern Studies, Zagreb etc.

 
Ideas for dance classes:

Different dance styles with historical background stories
couple-dances with switching roles,
ladies styling to free the woman’s passion, make them feel beautiful in their bodies, make them love their bodies and show their passion and femaleness through dance
also for men – breaking prejudices about men who can’t move
girls dancing with girls, men with men

We want to create a network of people in whole Europe (and wider), so that this festival becomes something stable and after some time we would open institutes in other countries. Also create a program for primary and secondary schools, also universities where already children would learn about different cultures and dance from small on, dance also with the other sex, learn that we are different and love the difference.
 
Why me?

People say that I have charisma and positive influence on people
I already do and live all what I explained above and I am determined to continue doing it in a more professional and sophisticated way, in order to spread my message and my method to wider audiences
I am raised in a multicultural family as also in multicultural surroundings

We're opening our magic box of interrupting tools - mentoring, networking, and training - to the public. By buying one of our exclusive services or campaign items, you're supporting women all over the world who we all need to have a mic in their hands. This is how we persist. This is how we interrupt. What is this campaign about? Increasing diverse voices in policy discussions and the media through FPI's tailored services.Through this limited campaign, we're opening our magic box of workshops, networking opportunities, and seminars to the public. You might be an area expert in Asia, Africa, Latin America, Europe, the Middle East or nuclear security, drones, trade policy; you might be focused on finance, global health, or education; you might work in law, business, national security, entrepreneurship - whatever your focus or expertise, if you are eager to develop your voice, get published, and participate in high-level discussions, our tailored training is for you and your squad.Your support -- whether it be through your rocking a limited edition FPI shirt or signing up for one of our workshops -- will help FPI expand its mentoring and leadership training; help us build other opportunities to help support diverse voices; help keep the pressure on the media to ensure gender parity.  Here's the challenge:  For the past three years, we've held four fellowship cycles with 19 fellows. We've mentored hundreds more. But if the past year has shown us anything, it's that we need to double down in our efforts to expand access and opportunity for women and those on the margins. We're on track to scale up FPI - to spread our knowledge and network far and wide. New America and the European Journalism Centre have backed us. We've been up to West Point and we've been over to Istanbul. Now we want to come to you, wherever you are. We need all hands on deck. The She Interrupts campaign isn't just about diversity for the sake of diversity. It's about tackling modern history's most complex issues. What we're offering:We've got a number of limited editions items - the #ShePersisted series designed by FPI ally and Helsinki-based illustrator Elina Tuomi.She reached out to us a few months ago, offering her beautiful art as a gift to the resistance. At a difficult time, she took our broken hearts and made them into art (and we made them into totes, posters, and stickers) with a beautiful vision board of inspiring interruptors. These women got in formation long before Bey sounded her battle cry. Let's follow suit.    About that magic box -- below is a menu of services you can purchase for the first time in FPI's history. We're offering different workshops and seminars to bring you to the next level of impact. By purchasing them, you're buying into a model that helps hundreds of women around the world gain the access they deserve, free of charge.  Half-day workshop - Introduction to Interrupting
This in-person half-day workshop is an introduction to interrupting your own mindset (and, eventually, the media).We start off with an assessment on (1) understanding your own strengths and challenges and (2) what is an “expert."" In the next hour we go through understanding unconscious bias in society as well as in ourselves; understanding the media landscape, including dispelling myths about who is “qualified” to be on the op-ed page and an on-air pundit. Afterwards, the group will engage in a role play. In the final hour, participants will prepare an outline of her expertise and a pitch to an editor.

We will offer this half-day workshop in New York and Washington D.C.
Customized seminars (three tiers):

Start with you: Building the ground floorYou have lots of goals. Where do you start? This hour-long online seminar will help you understand your strengths and challenges. We'll lay out a plan to build on your goals and help you move forward. It is specifically designed for recent college grads.

​Moving beyond the first rung of the career ladderYou scored your first job. Where do you go from here? It’s never too early to navigate your career. This hour-long online seminar will help you start building a career path and own your awesomeness. It is designed for those starting out, for those budding into interruptor extraordinaires.


Mid-career opportunities: Moving from good to greatYou've mastered the basics and moved up. You're ""senior"" or an ""expert,"" but feel stuck. How do you navigate a career midway through? How do you continue to grow, challenge yourself, and write that book? And how the heck do you get on CNN or Charlie Rose's show? This hour-long seminar will help those who are navigating that sacred middle, eager to take their power to the next level. 

FPI's Premier Fellowship Program:How do you pitch an editor? What are the do's and don'ts of public presentations? How do you build a personal brand? FPI's Fellowship Program tackles: media training, confidence building, sharpening your brand, and honing leadership skills. Above all, it is a home for you -- a space for you to flourish, a community to lean on as you ‘lean in.'FPI is your trampoline in changing the ratio. The FPI online flagship fellowship program takes place over six weeks and combines one-on-one sessions along with group classes. Each session will last approximately one hour.  What is FPI? The solutions to today's problems cannot be constructed in the minds of only half the population. To address them, we must meaningfully change whom we call upon as experts.Three years ago, we – two female foreign policy practitioners – were tired of complaining about the dearth of female voices in the media; we felt stuck in a conversational cul-de-sac where solutions were never discussed. Our frustration led us to launch Foreign Policy Interrupted, an initiative to amplify female voices in international affairs.FPI is solution-oriented. We’re not interested in the social media echo chamber. If we’re going to combat gender inequity, we must do more than merely acknowledge the problem. We need results.As we wrote in the New York Times in 2015:Brilliant female foreign policy minds exist in spades — it’s just a matter of how we get them on the op-ed page and on television talking about their expertise on a level equal to men. The stakes are high, not only for gender parity, but for our perceptions of the world.  What we doForeign Policy Interrupted has built a brain trust of female foreign policy experts and a platform for them to showcase their talent. Our goal is to change the perception about women as thought leaders by tapping into and unleashing their enormous potential to add value to the media, government, development, academia, national security, and the global economy.Currently our approach combines career/personal coaching and media training, while serving as a talent agency for some of the most brilliant women in the world. Coaching and media trainingThrough our own trademarked curriculum, FPI provides personalized coaching and mentoring for qualified women. Our curriculum covers confidence and brand building, media and leadership training.Talent agencyFollowing our six-week fellowship program, we match fellows with media outlets. Currently we work with Foreign Policy, Foreign Affairs, The Financial Times, New York Times, CNN, World Policy Journal, and Reuters. Fellows work with one of these outlets in an informal “externship” where they conceive articles for publication. What we want to do FPI has two main goals:
Interrupt outdated institutions (media, government, think tanks, academia, etc.)  that keep women at the margins

This campaign is to secure funding to fight the Bishop Paiute Tribal Council in court. Our tribe does not have a constitution to secure civil rights within our sovereign nation.  This fact has led to concentrated and unbalanced power with our tribal council. The council has taken 2 acres of our land assignment which are adjacent to our local Indian casino without due process of any kind.  We have retained an Indian Law attorney who is actively engaged with Bureau of Indian Affairs officials on the matter of who has legitimate rights to occupy the land. We are ramping up to go to federal court on this matter. </p>

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/784164/files/20140812181713-geb_1.jpg?1407892633"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Also, 6 of my family members and 2 supporters (including 5 tribal elders) are appealing trespass citations issued  by the tribal police for protesting on our own land.  My brother and myself are facing additional charges of trespassing and nuisance for obstructing tribal workers and equipment while trying to stop construction of a chain link fence across our land. I have also filed assault charges on two tribal employees. 
<p>This is a case of civil rights. As tribal members and American citizens we are protected by the Bill of Rights and the Indian Civil Rights Act of 1968. Our reservation has become a place of fear and intimidation from the tribal council.  Adequate funding of our legal defenses for both federal and tribal court will allow us to finally assert our rights in an impartial forum and force the tribal council to answer for its actions.  The outcome of our case will bring a sense of justice to our reservation and will drive forward the absolute necessity of creating and adhering to a tribal constitution and will show everyone that the tribal council cannot deny civil rights at will. </p> </div> <div> <h3>Two Court Cases </h3> <p></p>Our tribal council has its own paid lawyers to represent their interests paid for by the tribe. They have banked on the fact that tribal members simply cannot afford to fight in court. </div><div>We are raising $50K for legal fees and court costs. Our family has retained an Indian Law attorney and pulled together an initial $5,000 to start this process with the Bureau of Indian Affairs-  Pacific Region. We are expecting to go to federal court which will surely be time consuming and costly. This attorney will focus solely on the land issue with federal officials and the Bishop Paiute Tribal Council. Attorney's rate is $250 per hour. </div><div>We are also utilizing the services of a second attorney experienced in Indian Law who is offering her services free of charge. She is focusing on the trespass citations and our trespass appeal and research. Although she is not charging us we will pay for travel, lodging, and necessities as she resides out of state. She has already put in several hours on the case and if we can, we will offer compensation for her time. The reason we are fighting the trespass case is that it can provide us a 'stay' on casino expansion and will allow us to present our case for having the right to be on our own land.

 I am Ron Napoles, a Bishop Paiute Tribal member here in Bishop California. This campaign is to secure funding to fight the Bishop Paiute Tribal Council in court. Our tribe does not have a constitution to secure civil rights within our sovereign nation.  This fact has led to concentrated and unbalanced power with our tribal council. The council has taken 2 acres of our land assignment which are adjacent to our local Indian casino without due process of any kind.  We have retained an Indian Law attorney who is actively engaged with Bureau of Indian Affairs officials on the matter of who has legitimate rights to occupy the land. We are ramping up to go to federal court on this matter. 

Also, 6 of my family members and 2 supporters (including 5 tribal elders) are appealing trespass citations issued  by the tribal police for protesting on our own land.  My brother and myself are facing additional charges of trespassing and nuisance for obstructing tribal workers and equipment while trying to stop construction of a chain link fence across our land. I have also filed assault charges on two tribal employees. 
This is a case of civil rights. As tribal members and American citizens we are protected by the Bill of Rights and the Indian Civil Rights Act of 1968. Our reservation has become a place of fear and intimidation from the tribal council.  Adequate funding of our legal defenses for both federal and tribal court will allow us to finally assert our rights in an impartial forum and force the tribal council to answer for its actions.  The outcome of our case will bring a sense of justice to our reservation and will drive forward the absolute necessity of creating and adhering to a tribal constitution and will show everyone that the tribal council cannot deny civil rights at will.    Two Court Cases  Our tribal council has its own paid lawyers to represent their interests paid for by the tribe. They have banked on the fact that tribal members simply cannot afford to fight in court. We are raising $50K for legal fees and court costs. Our family has retained an Indian Law attorney and pulled together an initial $5,000 to start this process with the Bureau of Indian Affairs-  Pacific Region. We are expecting to go to federal court which will surely be time consuming and costly. This attorney will focus solely on the land issue with federal officials and the Bishop Paiute Tribal Council. Attorney's rate is $250 per hour. We are also utilizing the services of a second attorney experienced in Indian Law who is offering her services free of charge. She is focusing on the trespass citations and our trespass appeal and research. Although she is not charging us we will pay for travel, lodging, and necessities as she resides out of state. She has already put in several hours on the case and if we can, we will offer compensation for her time. The reason we are fighting the trespass case is that it can provide us a 'stay' on casino expansion and will allow us to present our case for having the right to be on our own land. Our local tribal court is set up, and financed by the tribal council.  The tribal court judge is paid by the council and has limited power.  The council has maintained most power for itself, specifically concerning land assignments. 

For perks we are offering original authentic Native American art work!  We have locally printed Save North Pa Ha T-shirts. We also have poster prints, hand sewn clothing, bags and material goods for specific donation amounts.  Finally we will be kicking in some locally made bead-work and various Indian art from family and friends. 
All funds raised will be put into court cost, lawyer fees and any incidental cost strictly related to the court case.

<div>WHO WE ARE, WHAT WE ARE ABOUT—The “Paul Newman” of Pierogies…</div>
<div>Join us in our mission to preserve the time-honored tradition of old world pierogies and bring back “old-fashioned taste in new frozen foods—PARMA PIEROGIES” once again to your grocer’s freezer!  We are re-launching the manufacturing division of  Parma Pierogies, and this time, we will be contributing 2/3’s of our net profits after taxes toward the betterment of children in the area of battered and abused kids.  Yes, that’s 2/3’s of our net profits after taxes—by law, non-profits ONLY have to give 5% to charity!? -- we are HopeAid, LLC, a newly formed charitable organization in Ohio with nationwide distribution--our 2/3’s net profits after taxes going to charity,  is part of our Operating Agreement and is listed in our Articles of Incorporation.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The founder of Parma Pierogies, Mary Poldruhi, believes “we can do with pierogies what Paul Newman has done for his charities with his Newman’s Own brand of salad dressings, juices, and more!""</div>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<div>OUR HISTORY</div>
<div>Parma Pierogies was a Cleveland, Ohio, success story in the nineties.  Initially setting out to franchise Polish fast-food, Mary successfully ran restaurants in several locations.  Mary's motivation was to build the franchise nationally, then begin her philanthropic efforts to help battered and abused children.  Her entrepreneurial efforts caught the national attention in Time magazine, Entrepreneur magazine and she was featured twice in Restaurant Hospitality, where the editors named  Parma Pierogies “the next McDonald's or Olive Garden”.   Though not politically affiliated, President Clinton visited the flagship restaurant twice, and Mary was selected by him as one of his 53 Faces of Hope.  The exposure brought more coverage, on NBC Nightly News, CNBC, and other national and local media. &gt; Next, Parma Pierogies expanded into the grocery market and they landed placement with six varieties of homestyle pierogies in nearly every grocer's freezer in the tri-state area.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<div>THE BUMP IN THE ROAD</div>
<div>After nearly a decade of success...what happened?  Several of our key resources, an attorney, an  automation equipment dealer, and a major investor broke  the trust we had placed in them.  In a climate where economic expansion was difficult, we had no choice but to close the doors. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Recently, a phone call to Mary from a friend working in children's services triggered her entrepreneurial zeal again. ""My friend told me an horrific story of a child,” she related, “who was returned to an abusive home because of a system loophole that eventually ended in the child's death.”</div>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<div>OUR COMEBACK!</div>
<div>The world is hungry for food from the heart!  We are poised to bring back that old-world, authentic taste of Parma Pierogies.  Our pierogies are low in fat, and contain no preservatives.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Today, we have a new business plan in hand.  It was recently selected a Council of Smaller Enterprises Business Pitch finalist, as judged by a panel of successful entrepreneurs including Daymond Jon of ABC's Shark Tank.  The first steps of the plan are to secure and renovate a building and  acquire the state-of-the-art automation equipment we need.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<div>HERE’S WHERE WE NEED YOU!  </div>
<div>Help us rebuild a successful business which will also support causes that better the lives of at-risk children.  The amount our plan calls for is high but it will give us the equipment and initial working capital we need. 52.3% of our goal will go toward the automation and related equipment and renovation of the warehouse, while 47.7% will go toward 6 months of operating expenses.   Providence House (<a href=""http://www.provhouse.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.provhouse.org</a>) is our primary beneficiary.  It is the nation's oldest crisis nursery, and they have listed us on their website under “upcoming/ongoing” events.  They also focus on prevention.  The other like-minded beneficiary in Lorain County, Ohio, is:  Blessing House at <a href=""http://www.blessinghouse.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.blessinghouse.org</a>
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>In pursuit of traditional funding, Mary related that she “nearly signed a major bank loan and almost gave 2/3 ownership of the company to a potential investor.”. She was “devastated to lose out on that opportunity from the angel investor until a light bulb went off -- we, as individuals and as a company, can be the ANGELS to children everyday!.”</div>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<div>WON'T YOU PLEASE GIVE WHAT YOU CAN TO HELP US AND HELP KIDS? </div>
<div>We deeply appreciate any help. Your contribution will make a big difference, and every $5, $10, $50, $100 or more, matters much.  Please spread the word to your family, friends, co-workers and community connections, via word-of-mouth or certainly by using social media.  THANK YOU SO MUCH, Best Regards, Mary</div>

YOU CAN BE PART OF THIS COMEBACK STORY WHICH WILL RE-LAUNCH OUR SUSTAINABLE, CHARITABLE BUSINESS THAT WILL GENERATE $ FOR KIDS FOR GENERATIONS TO COME...WITH YOUR ONE-TIME CONTRIBUTION.    (the ""Paul Newman's"" of pierogies).  Are you tired of making donations to some non-profits only to find out most of the $ goes to administrative?   We are giving 2/3's of our net profits after taxes toward the betterment of children...
 
FOR ANY QUESTIONS OR MORE INFORMATION, PLEASE CONTACT FOUNDER, MARY POLDRUHI AT 440-785-7094, mtp@glwb.net

 
 
WHO WE ARE, WHAT WE ARE ABOUT—The “Paul Newman” of Pierogies…
Join us in our mission to preserve the time-honored tradition of old world pierogies and bring back “old-fashioned taste in new frozen foods—PARMA PIEROGIES” once again to your grocer’s freezer!  We are re-launching the manufacturing division of  Parma Pierogies, and this time, we will be contributing 2/3’s of our net profits after taxes toward the betterment of children in the area of battered and abused kids.  Yes, that’s 2/3’s of our net profits after taxes—by law, non-profits ONLY have to give 5% to charity!? -- we are HopeAid, LLC, a newly formed charitable organization in Ohio with nationwide distribution--our 2/3’s net profits after taxes going to charity,  is part of our Operating Agreement and is listed in our Articles of Incorporation.
 
The founder of Parma Pierogies, Mary Poldruhi, believes “we can do with pierogies what Paul Newman has done for his charities with his Newman’s Own brand of salad dressings, juices, and more!""
 
 
OUR HISTORY
Parma Pierogies was a Cleveland, Ohio, success story in the nineties.  Initially setting out to franchise Polish fast-food, Mary successfully ran restaurants in several locations.  Mary's motivation was to build the franchise nationally, then begin her philanthropic efforts to help battered and abused children.  Her entrepreneurial efforts caught the national attention in Time magazine, Entrepreneur magazine and she was featured twice in Restaurant Hospitality, where the editors named  Parma Pierogies “the next McDonald's or Olive Garden”.   Though not politically affiliated, President Clinton visited the flagship restaurant twice, and Mary was selected by him as one of his 53 Faces of Hope.  The exposure brought more coverage, on NBC Nightly News, CNBC, and other national and local media. > Next, Parma Pierogies expanded into the grocery market and they landed placement with six varieties of homestyle pierogies in nearly every grocer's freezer in the tri-state area.  
 
 
THE BUMP IN THE ROAD
After nearly a decade of success...what happened?  Several of our key resources, an attorney, an  automation equipment dealer, and a major investor broke  the trust we had placed in them.  In a climate where economic expansion was difficult, we had no choice but to close the doors. 
 
Recently, a phone call to Mary from a friend working in children's services triggered her entrepreneurial zeal again. ""My friend told me an horrific story of a child,” she related, “who was returned to an abusive home because of a system loophole that eventually ended in the child's death.”
 
 
OUR COMEBACK!
The world is hungry for food from the heart!  We are poised to bring back that old-world, authentic taste of Parma Pierogies.  Our pierogies are low in fat, and contain no preservatives.
 
Today, we have a new business plan in hand.  It was recently selected a Council of Smaller Enterprises Business Pitch finalist, as judged by a panel of successful entrepreneurs including Daymond Jon of ABC's Shark Tank.  The first steps of the plan are to secure and renovate a building and  acquire the state-of-the-art automation equipment we need.  
 
 
HERE’S WHERE WE NEED YOU!  
Help us rebuild a successful business which will also support causes that better the lives of at-risk children.  The amount our plan calls for is high but it will give us the equipment and initial working capital we need. 52.3% of our goal will go toward the automation and related equipment and renovation of the warehouse, while 47.7% will go toward 6 months of operating expenses.   Providence House (www.provhouse.org) is our primary beneficiary.  It is the nation's oldest crisis nursery, and they have listed us on their website under “upcoming/ongoing” events.  They also focus on prevention.  The other like-minded beneficiary in Lorain County, Ohio, is:  Blessing House at www.blessinghouse.org

 
In pursuit of traditional funding, Mary related that she “nearly signed a major bank loan and almost gave 2/3 ownership of the company to a potential investor.”. She was “devastated to lose out on that opportunity from the angel investor until a light bulb went off -- we, as individuals and as a company, can be the ANGELS to children everyday!.”
 
 
WON'T YOU PLEASE GIVE WHAT YOU CAN TO HELP US AND HELP KIDS? 
We deeply appreciate any help. Your contribution will make a big difference, and every $5, $10, $50, $100 or more, matters much.  Please spread the word to your family, friends, co-workers and community connections, via word-of-mouth or certainly by using social media.  THANK YOU SO MUCH, Best Regards, Mary

Veterans for Veterans AmericA, Inc. was established by three disabled Veterans who witnessed far too many homeless Veterans on the streets of America. They devised a transitional housing/service support program plan to turn a vacant building into a service support center for homeless Veterans while assisting these Veterans at their local Veteran Administration Medical Center for needed medical treatment and vocational rehabilitation as the plan for their return to productive citizenry and self-sufficiency.
 
The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) states the nation’s homeless veterans are predominantly male, with roughly five percent being female. The majority of them are single; come from urban areas; and suffer from mental illness, alcohol and/or substance abuse, or co-occurring disorders. About one-third of the adult homeless population are Veterans.
 
According to the National Coalition for Homeless Veterans, America’s homeless Veterans have served in World War II, the Korean War, Cold War, Vietnam War, Grenada, Panama, Lebanon, Afghanistan and Iraq (OEF/OIF), and the military’s anti-drug cultivation efforts in South America. Nearly half of homeless Veterans served during the Vietnam era. Two-thirds served our country for at least three years, and one-third were stationed in a war zone.
 *About 1.5 million other Veterans, meanwhile, are considered at risk of homelessness due to poverty, lack of support networks, and dismal living conditions in overcrowded or substandard housing.

I am a writer, a working stiff, a quiet philanthropist and an activist for gay rights. Over the past few years, I have gotten to know a number of gay and lesbian Ugandans and learned of their horrific living conditions in a country where it is illegal to be gay. I have used my personal funds to help a number of them escape to more tolerant countries.  I have come to realize that I need help from others if I am to continue to help these persecuted people on an on-going basis.</li></ul><br/><ul><li>Imagine if you once held a decent job, had a partner, a place to live, and played soccer for recreation. Sometimes you marched for Gay Rights in your country. You were a good person living your life. Now, just because you are gay, you are thrown in jail, beaten, or left to starve in the slums of Kampala. This is not an exaggeration. For quite awhile, the LBGTI population of Uganda lived in fear of a ""Kill the Gays"" bill that would have imposed the death penalty. What has passed is the Anti-Homosexuality Bill, which imposes up to life sentences for being gay, with additional penalties (prison sentences) to anyone who knowingly rents an apartment or hires a gay person. Families are throwing their gay children out on the streets. Gays are being routed out of public internet cafes by mobs of people.  A government does not need to officially pass a ""death penalty"" to impose such on a group of people. This is what Uganda has done to its LBGTI population. </li></ul><br/><ul><li>In this campaign, we will help two young men experiencing persecution in Uganda to escape to South Africa or to another country where they can live without fear for their lives. Harold is currently wandering aimlessly in Uganda and starving. Bryan is imposing on a friend and living in a one room shack in the slums of Kampala. I am sending money from my personal account just to keep them fed as I can. Bryan and Harold are not their actual names because I cannot publicize that -- should the Ugandan authorities find out they are trying to escape, they will be immediately jailed. But they are two real people I have come to know.</li></ul><br/><ul><li>By contributing $5 or $10 to this campaign, you will help me to get Bryan and Harold to a place where they can find work, rent an apartment, and begin life anew, without fearing for their lives just for being themselves. I know that in this new age of crowd funding, we are asked to give money for everything from helping those who are ill with medical bills to someone's latest fantasy about producing a film about the mating habits of goats. This is why I am asking for just $5 - $10 per person. If I can get 300 people to give in those small amounts, you will will have saved the lives of two deserving gay Ugandan men. Of course, if you want to give more, that is always welcome.</li></ul><p></p><p></p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><ul><li>For $550 each, I can get Bryan and Harold safely to South Africa where gays are protected under the law. It takes about $300 to travel there which includes bribes to border guards, bus fare, and food. The other $200 is to get them started with food and an apartment (shared with other Ugandan refugees) once they enter South Africa. South Africa is the only country in Africa I know of where the  government is offering asylum and refugee status to persecuted LBGTI people of Uganda. In large part, this generosity is due to the late Nelson Mandela. The other $50 is to cover fundraising fees on Indigogo so we net out at least $1,000.</li></ul><br/><ul><li>If you can give $12, I will send you a copy of my new chapbook (when it is available for print, date to be announced in 2014, titled What's in A Butch's Purse and Other Humorous Essays .  (If you are interested in purchasing the book on your own, all the proceeds will go to this fundraising campaign.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The average life expectancy of a trans woman in Peru is 35. By 35, many women of our community lose their lives to violence, illness, and hunger. Our community faces discrimination, harrasment, and violence on a daily basis, and in the district of Lima East, trans women have no resource or refuge to turn to. </p>
<p>We are a group of trans women from Lima East, dedicated to helping our community. In partnership with the LGBTIQ advocacy organization, Presente, we will launch Lima East's first home for trans women. This home will be staffed and managed entirely by trans women from Lima East, and we will meet a variety of the needs of our community. For trans women in Lima East experiencing homelessness, we will provide a safe place to live with the warmth and support of a family. The home will also feature a beauty salon for trans women and a clinic to offer rapid HIV tests. We will run a number of community projects the home, and our partners at Presente will offer our community members workshops in personal development and employment training.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>For the home to get up and running, we will need 10,000 USD. Here is a breakdown of our projected budget:</p>
<p>Construction: 5,000 USD - We are building the home from the ground up. This amount will cover the construction of the house, including materials and contractors.</p>
<p>Administration: 3,000 - The home's administrative costs will cover our community activities, materials for our workshops, rapid HIV tests, and set-up costs for the beauty salon.</p>
<p>Salaries: 2,000 - Two staff members of the home will be paid a monthly salary of 600 USD. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Our home will give trans women in Lima East the chance to build a life. Not only will the home meet our community's basic needs, but we will also work tirelessly to empower these women to face the daunting challenges of their lives. We are investing in these women for the long term, and we are confident we have the passion, the dedication, and the capacity to establish a home that will serve the trans women of Lima East for decades to come. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Not surprisingly, we will face particular challenges in founding the Trans Home in Lima East.  </p>
<p>Firstly, we will need to ensure the sustainability of the home. For the home to achieve its mission, our staff must be equipped to administer and manage all the numerous aspects of our project. We will rely on capacity-building training from our partners at Presente, who have extensive experience in running community projects. The financial sustainability of the home is similarly critical to its success. Our goal for is to secure a variety of funding sources for the home to ensure its smooth operation in the first year. We are seeking individual and corporate donors and applying for a number of grants. While donations and grants will provide the bulk of our funding for the first year, we plan to generate income to cover a significant percentage of the home's costs through its beauty salon. Within two to three years, we aim to make the home financially self-sustainable.</p>
<p>Another pressing concern is the safety of the home and the women belonging to it. Our home will be officially registered with the municipality of the district, and we will advocate the district mayor to guarantee permanent police protection of the home. The safety of our community is our top concern, and our home will be a place of refuge.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We understand not everyone is able to give financially. If you are inspired by our project, we will launch a facebook page for the home very soon! Please check back for the link and like our page!</p>

MY NAME IS MARYA-- I’m the founder of ABQ Zine Fest, (now in its 4th year) The Albuquerque Zine Library, and a co-founder/curator of The Tannex, a DIY performance clubhouse, in this outpost, in the high desert of New Mexico. I love my creative community, and I do a lot to support and nurture it. I’m asking for your support as I embark on a new project that expands my love for zines, self-publishing, and storytelling . . .THE PAMPHLETEER PROJECT MISSION: to help diversify existing zine collections, or help establish new ones by presenting women/feminist focused, people of color influenced, gender-inclusive zines and comics to groups and collectives around the world.YOUR CONTRIBUTION TO THE PAMPHLETEER PROJECT will help me get to Sweden to present a pop-up zine library and free workshops at the TITWRENCH Stockholm Festival-- a women’s music festival. The fest was founded in Denver by Sarah Slater in 2008. TITWRENCH Stockholm is the first satellite of the original fest. After the event, I will donate 100-200 zines to a collective in the city. Here's a short video to show my appreciation for the support flowing in. THANKS SO MUCH!!..............................................................................................................................................YOUR GENEROUS FINANCIAL SUPPORT will:
Cover airfare to Stockholm.
Pay for simple materials to set up the zine library. 
If we surpass the goal of $2,500, this will allow me to take this pilot program and expand its reach to other collectives within the punk/zine community and beyond.

<p>With our small blessings in a backpack fundraiser we were able to raise over 70 backpacks filled with school supplies for a afternoon school for restavec children in Croix-des-Bouquets, Haiti. With this fundraiser donors donated backpacks filled with school supplies but included a personalized note to the child and in return they will get a personalized thank you note from their child along with pictures. Now we need your help shipping the donations over and helping a group of volunteers accompany us to Haiti this summer to visit the school and pass out the backpacks to the children.</p>
</div>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need a minimum of $2,000 to help pay for airfare and hotel stay for 4 days in Haiti for a group of 5 volunteers. You can sign up for our newsletter and stay current with our progress.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
The children at Institution Mixte le Sel are known as restavecs. They are Haiti's forgotten children basically day laborers. They are sent to work for families because their family can no longer support them. Many of them never attend school and cannot read or write. Institution Mixte le Sel is the only school in Croix-des-Bouquets, Haiti that allows them to attend school in the afternoon free of charge. Getting these backpacks to the children would be all the motivation they need for the 2013-2014 school year in Haiti, it let's them know that somebody out there believes in them.</div>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We're a small grassroots group, made up of pro-indy Catalans and Scots living in both nations. We feel it is important to give a voice to those of us who support freedom for our nations, because we wish to see Scotland and Catalonia governed by the people who care most about our future. And that's why we need to spread the word and get more supporters! </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>With your help we can reach thousands of people who probably don't know what's happening in Catalonia, and we will make them know the truth and know the repressive and fascist attitude of the Spanish Government.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>OK, so not everyone can afford to donate, but you can still help us:</p>
<p>· Get out the word about the Catalan cause. Spread the word, join our Facebook group, ""like"" our Facebook page, follow us on Twitter, etc.</p>
<p>· Contribute to the debate! If you're a proud supporter of the democratic pro-independence movement you can attend demonstrations, talk to your family, friends and neighbours - don't be afraid to get the word out.</p>

We're a small grassroots group, made up of pro-indy Catalans and Scots living in both nations. We feel it is important to give a voice to those of us who support freedom for our nations, because we wish to see Scotland and Catalonia governed by the people who care most about our future. And that's why we need to spread the word and get more supporters! 
 

What We Need & What You Get
Being honest, this campaign says we need 500 euros because it is the minimum required by IndieGogo, but with just 10 euros we can  create ads about the posts of the page, so any donation will have a great impact...
 

The Impact
With your help we can reach thousands of people who probably don't know what's happening in Catalonia, and we will make them know the truth and know the repressive and fascist attitude of the Spanish Government.
 
Other Ways You Can Help
OK, so not everyone can afford to donate, but you can still help us:
· Get out the word about the Catalan cause. Spread the word, join our Facebook group, ""like"" our Facebook page, follow us on Twitter, etc.
· Contribute to the debate! If you're a proud supporter of the democratic pro-independence movement you can attend demonstrations, talk to your family, friends and neighbours - don't be afraid to get the word out.",0.0,0,"5 Campaigns

<h3>The Story</h3>
<p>Sleepless in Seattle (SIS) was founded in fall 2014 by a group of Seattle-based volunteers led by Eddie Wang in response to the glaring needs of homeless people they passed every day in the U-District, most without so much as a sleeping bag.</p>
<p>The team galvanized financial and volunteer support from individuals, corporations, and nonprofits who shared a similar desire to see their street-side neighbors acknowledged, warm, and cared for. In the end, the team <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/sleepless-in-seattle-seattle-gives-back"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">raised over $75,000</a> to purchase and distribute 3,500 sleeping bags <a href=""https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=zCV8tY-2OF_E.kpo3FkbCP5-s"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.komonews.com/news/local/More-than-3200-homeless-in-King-County-rec-285755091.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">throughout King County</a> with the help of 220 volunteers and 17 nonprofits. </p>This year, the need is even bigger, and we're inviting you to join us in supporting the overlooked and  misunderstood in King County through sleeping bags, winter care packages, and neighborhood teams committed to caring for their own communities on an ongoing basis.</div><div>

<strong style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: initial;"">The Problem in 2015</strong><br/>
</h3>
<p>One year later, the challenge is every bit as formidable. On any given winter night, at least 3,800 people in King County sleep unsheltered, a 21% increase over 2014. </p>
<p><i>We can argue and debate homelessness, but that doesn’t help the person who is homeless tonight. We have to meet basic human needs first to have any hope of getting people back on their feet again. </i><br/>-Redmond Mayor John Marchione on Sleepless in Seattle</p>

<h3>Stories from Sleepless in Seattle 2014</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Thousands of stories came out of Sleepless in Seattle's 2014 Big Give when 220 volunteers met 2,300 people on the streets with simple acts of kindness. Here are just three snapshot stories:</p>
<p><b>The One with the Red Gloves</b></p>
<p><i>-Kim (volunteer from Sleepless in Seattle Big Give 2014)</i></p>
<div>
<p>""I experienced a few moments towards the end of our mission that will be forever in my mind and heart. We saw several homeless men sleeping on the ground under an overpass in Pioneer Square and we pulled over to offer sleeping bags and a caring word.</p>
<p>I woke someone covered head to toe in blankets. The face that peeked out was that of an elderly gentleman who appeared to me to be in his eighties. He gave me a sleepy smile and nodded that he would like the sleeping bag I offered. I asked if we could open it and cover him with it and he nodded again. He then nodded towards a red hat and gloves that a prior Good Samaritan had left. I asked if I could help him put them on, and he said no that they were for me... I tried several times to politely decline and he implored me to take them as his Christmas gift to me."" </p>
<p><b>The One with the Joy Ride Home</b></p>
<p><i>-Dianna (volunteer from Sleepless in Seattle Big Give 2014)</i></p>
<p>""My most impactful experience was the trip back from South Seattle (where I was distributing sleeping bags) to Wallingford (where I live). We handed out 50 sleeping bags ourselves and felt like we reached most of the homeless in White Center. On my way back home, I passed through Central Downtown and every homeless person I saw had a sleeping bag. Later, when I went to the grocery story in Wallingford, the homeless folks outside also had the sleeping bags. It was awesome seeing how thoroughly a community could bring change to a region as large as Seattle in a single day.""</p>
<p><b>The One with the One</b></p>
<i style=""font-weight: normal;"">-Eddie Wang (Co-Organizer of Sleepless in Seattle)</i><p></p>
<p>During the Big Give, one of my privileges was greeting volunteers who were returning from the streets. I remember encountering one team who had just come back from Redmond. I asked them how many people they had been able to serve on their trip (teams that had been going to downtown had often served 50-100). The team replied that after crossing the 520 toll and roaming Redmond for hours, they found one young man outside the Redmond library that they were able to meet with a sleeping bag and a friendly conversation. They concluded this with the statement: ""And it was all worth it.""</p>
<p>Perhaps more than any other story, this vignette captures the heart of Sleepless in Seattle. Countless hours had been poured into planning every aspect of fundraising, logistics, and direct contact work - all to bless one person with the simple gift of warmth and friendship. Call it the ""Saving Private Ryan"" effect or call it a miracle, but whatever ""it"" is, I truly believe we need more of ""it"" in our community.</p>

<h3>FAQ</h3>
<p></p>
<p><b>Do people who are homeless need sleeping bags?</b></p>
<p>Yes. The Sleepless in Seattle team has reached out to over a dozen local nonprofits who work with homeless populations to assess the need. These nonprofits have responded with an assessment of significant need with one nonprofit estimating that 80% of the homeless on the streets do not have access to sleeping bags.</p>
<p><i>""The unfortunate reality is that we do not have the capacity to house all of the homeless youth in our community. Having resources, like sleeping bags, is critical to helping them survive the night and helps us start the conversation forward to get them off the streets."" </i><br/>-Melinda Giovengo, PhD, Executive Director of Youth Care<br/></p>
<p><i>We need the whole community engaged to solve homelessness. The Sleepless in Seattle effort is a compassionate way for people to help others stay warm, and to raise awareness for the need for more homes for the homeless.  </i><br/>Mark Putnam - Executive Director of All Home King County (formerly the King County Committee to end Homelessness)</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Is Sleepless in Seattle an accredited 501(c)(3) nonprofit?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. The Sleepless in Seattle team has partnered with Urban Hands, an existing Seattle-based 501(c)(3) nonprofit which provides meal partnership and second chance job opportunities in the Seattle area. This unique relationship affords the Sleepless in Seattle team the advantages of legal recognition as a nonprofit while greatly reducing all administrative costs.</p>
<p><b>Can I give by check?</b></p>
<p>Yes. If you would prefer to bypass the Indiegogo fundraising tool, please mail a check to ""Sleepless in Seattle - 8420 Greenwood Ave N. Seattle WA 98103"" paid to the order of ""Urban Hands"" with memo ""Sleepless in Seattle."" </p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong><b>Are donations tax-deductible?</b></strong></p>
<p>Yes. Donors can expect to receive an email from payment processor FirstGiving with a tax-deductible receipt from the nonprofit Urban Hands. </p>
<p><b>Where exactly is the money going?</b></p>
<p>The money is going directly to the purchase of sleeping bags and winter care packages. Everyone serving on this project is serving in a volunteer capacity. The minimal administrative costs to cover accounting operations are covered out-of-pocket by the Sleepless in Seattle team.</p>
<p><b>What happened to last year's sleeping bags?</b></p>
<p>1) The One Night count reported at 21% increase in homelessness in King County between 2014 and 2015 meaning many of those currently on the streets have never received a sleeping bag.</p>
<p>2) The homeless population tends to be very transient. A significant portion of homeless persons in King County have entered the region while others have left.</p>
<p>3) Many sleeping bags will not be able to last a full year when faced with the challenging conditions of everyday use on the streets. General street abrasion, water damage, and theft all contribute to challenges in long-term use. </p>
<p>4) Housing a homeless person in emergency shelter often costs $20/day or more. Every option has a cost. Sleeping bags will not end homelessness, but they will help bridge the gap for those who simply need a blanket for the winter.</p>
<p><b>If sleeping bags won't last a full year, then why do the campaign at all?</b></p>
<p>Food and shelter are basic necessities that we believe every individual is entitled to. Everyday, thousands of free meals are served across King County. These meals cost money. Likewise, caring for the shelter-oriented needs of individuals costs money. As the King County's homeless shelters do not have adequate space to take in every homeless person, the Sleepless in Seattle team is committed to bridging the gap. We truly believe that $100,000 is a bargain to keep every homeless person in King County warm for the winter.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>What specific sleeping bags &amp; winter care package goods will be purchased?</b></p>
<p>The sleeping bags will be purchased in bulk from American-manufacturer Exxel Outdoors. The <a href=""http://www.walmart.com/ip/Everest-Mummy-5F-15C-Degree-Sleeping-Bag/2581360"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">specific sleeping bags</a> are mummy-style and rated to +5F. Winter care package <a href=""https://www.dollardays.com/i1869074-wholesale-mens-hat-fleece-gloves-and-crew-socks-combo.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">socks, gloves, and hat</a> will be purchased from Dollar Days. Each care package will come in a reusable <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=drawstring+cinch+backpack&amp;es_sm=93&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CAgQ_AUoAmoVChMI0f-gpP-5yAIVhTOICh0hqQQU#imgrc=eXtvkeKKVjOjUM%3A"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">drawstring cinch backpack</a>. The $25 will cover the cost of a sleeping bag, a winter care package essentials, a draw string bag, and per-unit shipping costs. </p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><b>Is Sleepless in Seattle religiously affiliated?</b></p>
<p>Sleepless in Seattle was founded on the life example and teachings of Jesus to love others. We are committed to partnering with anyone with a desire to help others and are committed to serving every person we meet to the highest degree possible.</p>
<p><b>Why can't those who are homeless help themselves?</b></p>
<p>Homelessness is a complex issue with interrelated causes including addiction, domestic violence, mental illness, job loss and unemployment, foreclosure, relational brokenness, etc. </p>
<p>No one ever got to be President of the United States or CEO of a Fortune 500 company without a little help along the way. The same is true of those who are working their way off the streets. Judgment is the duty of the courts. Compassion is the duty of everyday citizens.</p>

Press links at bottom of page.

The Story
Sleepless in Seattle (SIS) was founded in fall 2014 by a group of Seattle-based volunteers led by Eddie Wang in response to the glaring needs of homeless people they passed every day in the U-District, most without so much as a sleeping bag.
The team galvanized financial and volunteer support from individuals, corporations, and nonprofits who shared a similar desire to see their street-side neighbors acknowledged, warm, and cared for. In the end, the team raised over $75,000 to purchase and distribute 3,500 sleeping bags throughout King County with the help of 220 volunteers and 17 nonprofits. This year, the need is even bigger, and we're inviting you to join us in supporting the overlooked and  misunderstood in King County through sleeping bags, winter care packages, and neighborhood teams committed to caring for their own communities on an ongoing basis.

The Problem in 2015

One year later, the challenge is every bit as formidable. On any given winter night, at least 3,800 people in King County sleep unsheltered, a 21% increase over 2014. 
We can argue and debate homelessness, but that doesn’t help the person who is homeless tonight. We have to meet basic human needs first to have any hope of getting people back on their feet again. -Redmond Mayor John Marchione on Sleepless in Seattle

Short-Term Efforts: Sleeping Bags, Winter Care Packages & Volunteering at the ""Big Give""
Sleepless in Seattle will be purchasing sleeping bags and winter care packages (containing warm socks/hat/gloves, food, and water) with funds raised from this campaign. We will need your help to get there. 
""We make a living by what we get, we make a life by what we give."" -Winston Churchill
Curious what 3,500 sleeping bags looks like? Take a look.

3,500 sleeping bags from 2014's Big Give at Serve Seattle. Sleepover anyone?
This year, we are shooting for 4,000 sleeping bags and 4,000 winter care packages with warm socks, gloves, hats, food, and water - all in a compact drawstring bag (see FAQ for why we are buying sleeping bags again this year). $25 will cover the cost of one sleeping bag, one winter care package with warm socks/hat/gloves. 100% of funds will go towards sleeping bags and care package supplies for the homeless in Seattle & King County. 
Don't worry. We've done the math for you:



1,000 * $100 = $100,000. Teamwork makes the dream work! Alternatively... 1 * $100,000 = $100,000. Does anyone have Mr. Gates' number?
These sleeping bags and winter care packages will be distributed at our ""Big Give"" on Saturday 11/21 at University Christian Church (See 2014 Big Give). Over 200 volunteers, broken into 50 teams, will gather and then be dispersed across the streets of King County to serve those in need. Early registrants and donors will be given priority access to attend the Big Give as a volunteer. Please signup through this volunteer interest form if you would like to attend the Big Give.

These teams will be led by experienced leaders and will care for homeless people in specific neighborhoods (see map below) on an ongoing basis through direct personal contact on the streets. 


Neighborhood Teams Downtown Map

Over the next few months, we will blanket the entirety of King County with volunteer teams so that every homeless neighbor is routinely met by a community of people who will:


Build relationships and make friends.We believe that in the context of friendship, ""people happen."" Friends provide emotional support and empower one another to make healthy life choices. 
Meet immediate needs.Teams will help provide basic life essentials like food, water, sleeping bags, as needs arises.
Make referrals to appropriate social services.Teams will partner with appropriate nonprofits, businesses, and social services to make referrals (e.g. long-term housing options).

The world needs dreamers, and the world needs doers. But most of all, the world needs dreamers who do. - Sarah Ban Breathnach

Would you consider dreaming with us and doing with us? Please sign up through our non-binding volunteer interest form.

Stories from Sleepless in Seattle 2014

Thousands of stories came out of Sleepless in Seattle's 2014 Big Give when 220 volunteers met 2,300 people on the streets with simple acts of kindness. Here are just three snapshot stories:
The One with the Red Gloves
-Kim (volunteer from Sleepless in Seattle Big Give 2014)

""I experienced a few moments towards the end of our mission that will be forever in my mind and heart. We saw several homeless men sleeping on the ground under an overpass in Pioneer Square and we pulled over to offer sleeping bags and a caring word.
I woke someone covered head to toe in blankets. The face that peeked out was that of an elderly gentleman who appeared to me to be in his eighties. He gave me a sleepy smile and nodded that he would like the sleeping bag I offered. I asked if we could open it and cover him with it and he nodded again. He then nodded towards a red hat and gloves that a prior Good Samaritan had left. I asked if I could help him put them on, and he said no that they were for me... I tried several times to politely decline and he implored me to take them as his Christmas gift to me."" 
The One with the Joy Ride Home
-Dianna (volunteer from Sleepless in Seattle Big Give 2014)
""My most impactful experience was the trip back from South Seattle (where I was distributing sleeping bags) to Wallingford (where I live). We handed out 50 sleeping bags ourselves and felt like we reached most of the homeless in White Center. On my way back home, I passed through Central Downtown and every homeless person I saw had a sleeping bag. Later, when I went to the grocery story in Wallingford, the homeless folks outside also had the sleeping bags. It was awesome seeing how thoroughly a community could bring change to a region as large as Seattle in a single day.""
The One with the One
-Eddie Wang (Co-Organizer of Sleepless in Seattle)
During the Big Give, one of my privileges was greeting volunteers who were returning from the streets. I remember encountering one team who had just come back from Redmond. I asked them how many people they had been able to serve on their trip (teams that had been going to downtown had often served 50-100). The team replied that after crossing the 520 toll and roaming Redmond for hours, they found one young man outside the Redmond library that they were able to meet with a sleeping bag and a friendly conversation. They concluded this with the statement: ""And it was all worth it.""
Perhaps more than any other story, this vignette captures the heart of Sleepless in Seattle. Countless hours had been poured into planning every aspect of fundraising, logistics, and direct contact work - all to bless one person with the simple gift of warmth and friendship. Call it the ""Saving Private Ryan"" effect or call it a miracle, but whatever ""it"" is, I truly believe we need more of ""it"" in our community.


FAQ

Do people who are homeless need sleeping bags?
Yes. The Sleepless in Seattle team has reached out to over a dozen local nonprofits who work with homeless populations to assess the need. These nonprofits have responded with an assessment of significant need with one nonprofit estimating that 80% of the homeless on the streets do not have access to sleeping bags.
""The unfortunate reality is that we do not have the capacity to house all of the homeless youth in our community. Having resources, like sleeping bags, is critical to helping them survive the night and helps us start the conversation forward to get them off the streets."" -Melinda Giovengo, PhD, Executive Director of Youth Care
We need the whole community engaged to solve homelessness. The Sleepless in Seattle effort is a compassionate way for people to help others stay warm, and to raise awareness for the need for more homes for the homeless.  Mark Putnam - Executive Director of All Home King County (formerly the King County Committee to end Homelessness)

Is Sleepless in Seattle an accredited 501(c)(3) nonprofit?
Yes. The Sleepless in Seattle team has partnered with Urban Hands, an existing Seattle-based 501(c)(3) nonprofit which provides meal partnership and second chance job opportunities in the Seattle area. This unique relationship affords the Sleepless in Seattle team the advantages of legal recognition as a nonprofit while greatly reducing all administrative costs.
Can I give by check?
Yes. If you would prefer to bypass the Indiegogo fundraising tool, please mail a check to ""Sleepless in Seattle - 8420 Greenwood Ave N. Seattle WA 98103"" paid to the order of ""Urban Hands"" with memo ""Sleepless in Seattle."" 

Are donations tax-deductible?
Yes. Donors can expect to receive an email from payment processor FirstGiving with a tax-deductible receipt from the nonprofit Urban Hands. 
Where exactly is the money going?
The money is going directly to the purchase of sleeping bags and winter care packages. Everyone serving on this project is serving in a volunteer capacity. The minimal administrative costs to cover accounting operations are covered out-of-pocket by the Sleepless in Seattle team.
What happened to last year's sleeping bags?
1) The One Night count reported at 21% increase in homelessness in King County between 2014 and 2015 meaning many of those currently on the streets have never received a sleeping bag.
2) The homeless population tends to be very transient. A significant portion of homeless persons in King County have entered the region while others have left.
3) Many sleeping bags will not be able to last a full year when faced with the challenging conditions of everyday use on the streets. General street abrasion, water damage, and theft all contribute to challenges in long-term use. 
4) Housing a homeless person in emergency shelter often costs $20/day or more. Every option has a cost. Sleeping bags will not end homelessness, but they will help bridge the gap for those who simply need a blanket for the winter.
If sleeping bags won't last a full year, then why do the campaign at all?
Food and shelter are basic necessities that we believe every individual is entitled to. Everyday, thousands of free meals are served across King County. These meals cost money. Likewise, caring for the shelter-oriented needs of individuals costs money. As the King County's homeless shelters do not have adequate space to take in every homeless person, the Sleepless in Seattle team is committed to bridging the gap. We truly believe that $100,000 is a bargain to keep every homeless person in King County warm for the winter.

What specific sleeping bags & winter care package goods will be purchased?
The sleeping bags will be purchased in bulk from American-manufacturer Exxel Outdoors. The specific sleeping bags are mummy-style and rated to +5F. Winter care package socks, gloves, and hat will be purchased from Dollar Days. Each care package will come in a reusable drawstring cinch backpack. The $25 will cover the cost of a sleeping bag, a winter care package essentials, a draw string bag, and per-unit shipping costs. 

Is Sleepless in Seattle religiously affiliated?
Sleepless in Seattle was founded on the life example and teachings of Jesus to love others. We are committed to partnering with anyone with a desire to help others and are committed to serving every person we meet to the highest degree possible.
Why can't those who are homeless help themselves?
Homelessness is a complex issue with interrelated causes including addiction, domestic violence, mental illness, job loss and unemployment, foreclosure, relational brokenness, etc. 
No one ever got to be President of the United States or CEO of a Fortune 500 company without a little help along the way. The same is true of those who are working their way off the streets. Judgment is the duty of the courts. Compassion is the duty of everyday citizens.

<p>We’re a 24/7 30+2 emergency bed shelter providing resident and legal advocacy for survivors of domestic violence, sexual assault and human trafficking.

We also run a program called “Building healthy relationships” that goes to area schools and teaches kids what healthy emotional boundaries look like and how to identify abusive behavior. At least several times a year students realize their household is abusive and are able to come to us for help. That program presents to thousands of students every year. We do all this with a full and part time staff of about 65 people and a rotating small army of volunteers, so every single cent helps.

<p>If you're reading this, hi! <br/><br/><br/>The Together Project is a fundraiser created by 10 young artists, wanting to support migrant workers in Singapore.<br/><br/><br/><b>What's Going On with Migrant Workers?</b><br/><br/>Migrant workers often endure long hours doing heavy, high-risk manual labour for unfairly low wages, while having to live in improperly-maintained, overcrowded dorms, miles away from family. Living in conditions like these leaves them vulnerable to illness, financial issues, as well as extreme emotional distress. <br/><br/><br/>In fact, the poor standard of living has heavily contributed to the disproportionately high number of Covid-19 cases amongst migrant workers in Singapore, with cramped dorms allowing for the virus to spread easily. To make things worse, many cannot afford to pay for medical treatments and housing improvements by themselves because they aren't even paid on time, or even enough. <br/><br/><br/>So we've decided to help them out and raise some money! <br/><br/><br/><b>Why Your Donation Matters</b><br/><br/>Donating is also an important symbol of recognition of how their hard work plays a significant role helping our society grow. Migrant workers are human too, and they deserve to live in more humane living conditions. <br/><br/><br/>If you donate a minimum of SGD$15.00, you'll get one pack of 10 cute construction animal stickers, which we will send via postal mail! <br/><br/><br/>If you can't afford to donate that much, we'd still be really thankful for a smaller donation. It's the thought that counts, and we still acknowledge and deeply appreciate your intention to help. You can also share our campaign to spread awareness, which helps too! <br/><br/><br/>All profits will go to TWC2 (Transient Workers Count Too), an organization which helps migrant workers in need. Details about the organization are on their website so you know exactly how your donation will be put to good use.

</div></div>","If you're reading this, hi! The Together Project is a fundraiser created by 10 young artists, wanting to support migrant workers in Singapore.What's Going On with Migrant Workers?Migrant workers often endure long hours doing heavy, high-risk manual labour for unfairly low wages, while having to live in improperly-maintained, overcrowded dorms, miles away from family. Living in conditions like these leaves them vulnerable to illness, financial issues, as well as extreme emotional distress. In fact, the poor standard of living has heavily contributed to the disproportionately high number of Covid-19 cases amongst migrant workers in Singapore, with cramped dorms allowing for the virus to spread easily. To make things worse, many cannot afford to pay for medical treatments and housing improvements by themselves because they aren't even paid on time, or even enough. So we've decided to help them out and raise some money! Why Your Donation MattersDonating is also an important symbol of recognition of how their hard work plays a significant role helping our society grow. Migrant workers are human too, and they deserve to live in more humane living conditions. If you donate a minimum of SGD$15.00, you'll get one pack of 10 cute construction animal stickers, which we will send via postal mail! If you can't afford to donate that much, we'd still be really thankful for a smaller donation. It's the thought that counts, and we still acknowledge and deeply appreciate your intention to help. You can also share our campaign to spread awareness, which helps too! All profits will go to TWC2 (Transient Workers Count Too), an organization which helps migrant workers in need. Details about the organization are on their website so you know exactly how your donation will be put to good use. Here's a link to their site: https://twc2.org.sg/ Sticker Art Lineup

<p>Hello Indiegogoers! My name is Josh Kirby and I'm here to ask for your help. As you know with the current state of the economy, everyone is cutting corners. Some of us may be going out less or being more frugile at the grocery store. Others may be eating one less meal a day, or not paying the rent to feed themselves or their family. This shouldn't be happening. </p>
<p>The homeless population here in miami is unbeleivable. We have people sleeping on public benchs, eating out of trash cans, and stealing just to keep themselves alive. I want to put a stop to this! The treasure Trove boutique is my answer.</p>
<p>The Treasure Trove Boutique is going to be a high-end consignment store carrying many of the top designer items. Say you have a pair of shoes or a shirt that have been sitting in your closet for months getting eaten by moths or collecting dust. Bring these items that you no longer need to the Treasure Trove and we will sell them for you! Once the item sells the profit will be devided 60/40. </p>
<p><strong>With the majority of the profit that we receive we will fight to end Homelessness in Miami and eventually all over the United States. It all starts with you!</strong></p>
<p>The profit will be divided into 3 major categories; Food, travel, and clothing. I have teamed up with Publix supermarket to give out food vouchers to the homeless. Also, I have contacted the Miami Dade transit to provide discounted bus passes that I will be able to distribute to the homeless here in the city. The Treasure Trove will also accept donations that we can use to clothe people who may not be able to afford the outfit needed to go to an interview. </p>
<p>My intent is to have a successful business that allows me to form a network with the local VA of Miami, that can help veterans get to appointments, assistance of any kind that also helps them to be self reliant, all without losing what is left of their dignity.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>What we need</strong></h2>
<div>My goal is to raise $6,000 with your help. I plan to use this site as well as fundraise in the community. The $6,000 will be used for:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>$650/month rent in a high foot and car traffic area (First, Second, Last, and Deposit) =<em>$2,600</em>
</li>
<li>Permits, business license, water, electricity, and internet = <em>$1,000</em>
</li>
<li>Advertisement and signage = <em>$1,000</em>
</li>
<li>Furniture, racks, hangers, and cash register = <em>$1,000</em>
</li>
<li>Miscellaneous items including pens, paper, bathroom items, price tag, pricing gun, etc. = <em>$400</em>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Total = $6,000</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>If the $6,000 goal is not reached all of the money raised will be donated to the Camilas homeless shelter + everything over the goal if it is reached. Also, %1  of the goal will be donated to the wonderful Camillus house for all of the help and support they have given to us.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2>The Impact</h2>
<div>This project will benefit three groups of people. The seller, buyer, and the family sleeping under the bridge. The seller will be able to sell their gently used clothing without doing hardly any work. The buyer will be able to get very nice clothing at far less than retail value. Lastly, the homeless family will be able to have a couple healthy meals, enouragement to find a job with their new clothes and a way to get there. </div>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>When a queer student group and a feminist club teamed up at 
Harvard University to raise awareness about gender equality, the 
resulting 2010 campaign, <strong>Feminist Coming Out Day</strong>, 
brought together not only the two organizations, but also the campus 
community. Inspired by National Coming   Out Day, a holiday which 
encourages  awareness of issues affecting the   queer community, our 
event was an opportunity for alliance, collaboration, bridge-building, 
and  inclusion. This school year, we want to expand the Feminist Coming 
Out Day to  high schools and colleges throughout the United States, so we're partnering with <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Bitch Magazine</span> and taking the campaign online!<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Last year at Harvard, we put a face to feminism by donning buttons and t-shirts that said ""This Is What A Feminist Looks Like"" and holding a photo exhibit called the Feminist Portrait Project. Now we're making this merchandise available to feminist and LGBT  
student organizations across the country, so that they can plan events like this on their own campuses. <a href=""http://bitchmagazine.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title="""">Bitch Media</a> is helping us get the word out, and all the profits for this merchandise will help fund feminist media. Even if you’re not in school, you can 
still participate. Put a ""This Is What A Feminist Looks Like"" sticker on your laptop, snap a photo of yourself in our t-shirt, send in your feminist manifesto as a submission to our online <a href=""http://feministcomingoutday.com/submit"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title="""">Feminist Portrait Project</a>, and tell your friends and colleagues about our campaign to show the diversity among supporters of gender equality.<br/></p>
<br/>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact <br/>
</h3>From now until the end of March, we'll be featuring ""portraits"" of participants on our website, as well as photos from student-run Feminist Coming Out Day celebrations. Individual sales make it possible for us to offer merchandise at discounted rates to student and non-profit organizations.<br/><br/>All proceeds of this campaign go to fund our charitable partner, Bitch Media, the nonprofit organization that publishes ""Bitch: Feminist Response to Pop Culture"", a magazine which has subscribers in 46 countries and all 50 states. They'll be rewarding our biggest donors with subscriptions as well as shout-outs on their website. So help us publicize this effort on <a href=""http://twitter.com/feminismday"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title="""">Twitter</a>, <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/pages/Feminist-Coming-Out-Day/106219662743936"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title="""">Facebook</a>, and your blog, and start snapping photos to start your own Feminist Portrait Project. Check out our <a href=""http://feministcomingoutday.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title="""">official website</a> for supporters participating from around the world and for updates on the Feminist Coming Out Day events taking place on different campuses.<br/>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In exchange for your contribution, you'll get a sweet set of gear to don on March 8th and a post-event 
rundown from other folks doing the same from across the country. Have a group of feminist friends or want to hold your own event? Go big with your contribution and get a bulk set of merchandise at a discounted rate for groups. But whether you only have a few bucks of your own or several hundred in grant money for a rally, anything you contribute will help us coordinate a national campaign that hopes to represent the full spectrum of feminist identities. Even if you can't afford to donate, you can still participate for free and get your voice heard on our website. Send in your story, thoughts, and opinions about gender equality  to our site to be included in our online <a href=""http://feministcomingoutday.com/submit"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title="""">Feminist Portrait Project</a>.</p>

Our Story


When a queer student group and a feminist club teamed up at 
Harvard University to raise awareness about gender equality, the 
resulting 2010 campaign, Feminist Coming Out Day, 
brought together not only the two organizations, but also the campus 
community. Inspired by National Coming   Out Day, a holiday which 
encourages  awareness of issues affecting the   queer community, our 
event was an opportunity for alliance, collaboration, bridge-building, 
and  inclusion. This school year, we want to expand the Feminist Coming 
Out Day to  high schools and colleges throughout the United States, so we're partnering with Bitch Magazine and taking the campaign online!

Last year at Harvard, we put a face to feminism by donning buttons and t-shirts that said ""This Is What A Feminist Looks Like"" and holding a photo exhibit called the Feminist Portrait Project. Now we're making this merchandise available to feminist and LGBT  
student organizations across the country, so that they can plan events like this on their own campuses. Bitch Media is helping us get the word out, and all the profits for this merchandise will help fund feminist media. Even if you’re not in school, you can 
still participate. Put a ""This Is What A Feminist Looks Like"" sticker on your laptop, snap a photo of yourself in our t-shirt, send in your feminist manifesto as a submission to our online Feminist Portrait Project, and tell your friends and colleagues about our campaign to show the diversity among supporters of gender equality.


The Impact 
From now until the end of March, we'll be featuring ""portraits"" of participants on our website, as well as photos from student-run Feminist Coming Out Day celebrations. Individual sales make it possible for us to offer merchandise at discounted rates to student and non-profit organizations.All proceeds of this campaign go to fund our charitable partner, Bitch Media, the nonprofit organization that publishes ""Bitch: Feminist Response to Pop Culture"", a magazine which has subscribers in 46 countries and all 50 states. They'll be rewarding our biggest donors with subscriptions as well as shout-outs on their website. So help us publicize this effort on Twitter, Facebook, and your blog, and start snapping photos to start your own Feminist Portrait Project. Check out our official website for supporters participating from around the world and for updates on the Feminist Coming Out Day events taking place on different campuses.

What We Need & What You Get
In exchange for your contribution, you'll get a sweet set of gear to don on March 8th and a post-event 
rundown from other folks doing the same from across the country. Have a group of feminist friends or want to hold your own event? Go big with your contribution and get a bulk set of merchandise at a discounted rate for groups. But whether you only have a few bucks of your own or several hundred in grant money for a rally, anything you contribute will help us coordinate a national campaign that hopes to represent the full spectrum of feminist identities. Even if you can't afford to donate, you can still participate for free and get your voice heard on our website. Send in your story, thoughts, and opinions about gender equality  to our site to be included in our online Feminist Portrait Project.

Other Ways You Can Help
Get some of your friends together for a bulk order or organize an exhibit on March 8th with a student group on campus. Are you interested in raising money for your club or cause with your own Feminist Portrait Project or t-shirt sale? Contact Lena at lena [at] lenachen [dot] com to find out how we organized this campaign!
T-Shirt & Merchandise FAQs

1. What does the design for this year's merchandise look like?
Check out the image above. For an enlarged version, click here.

2. How does the sizing work? Can guys wear these shirts?
Anyone can wear them, since they're not made specifically 
with women in mind! Remember to size up since these are fitted tees that are not as large as your traditional loose-fit unisex t-shirts.  If you prefer a loose fit, add two sizes to your normal size.  (""Fitted"" means that the shirts are made of 
stretchier material.) Shirts are available in XS, SM, MED, LG, XL, XXL on a first-come, first-served basis. We are out of XS and XL shirts. A measurement guide:
SMALL | Widest point (bottom of waist): 16 inches across | Narrowest point (center): 14 inches across


MEDIUM | Widest point (bottom of waist): 17 inches across | Narrowest point (center): 14.5 inches across
LARGE | Widest point (bottom of waist): 19 inches across | Narrowest point (center): 15 inches across

XLARGE | Widest point (bottom of waist): 19.5 inches across | Narrowest point (center): 16 inches across


3. How many shirts are available?
We've made a limited run of 1,000 tees for 2011. Reserve your shirt by pledging a minimum $20 contribution and by emailing feministcomingoutday@gmail.com with your name, t-shirt size, and address (if it is a different shipping address than the one entered in IndieGoGo). If you are ordering as a group, please send all sizing information (as well requests for extra buttons and stickers) under one email, and specify an address where the bulk shipment can be received. If you live outside of the U.S., please contact us before making a contribution for international shipping rates.

4. Why does the shirt cost $20?


We wanted to make something that could last you 
year after year for many Feminist Coming Out Days to come. The ""This Is 
What A 
Feminist Looks Like"" Shirt is a V-neck collar fitted, sheer jersey 
cotton tee that was made in America by Royal Apparel and printed in 
Wisconsin with a custom design in a 2-color
 water-based ink. The price of your tee ($15 for groups, $20 for 
individuals) pays for the material, custom screen-printing, and 
shipping/handling charges, and allows for a contribution to Bitch Magazine.

5. Will you be printing more shirts after you sell out all 1,000 tees?
Because of the huge upfront cost, we can't guarantee that we'll be printing more tees once we sell out, nor can we guarantee what the quality or price of any future merchandise will be. Groups should notify us of potential bulk orders and desired sizes as early as possible (even if you have not yet finalized a donation), so that we can reserve enough merchandise. 

6. Why should I order with a group?
Individuals pay $20 per tee, but groups get discounted rates. (Tees are $18/ea for five, $17.50/ea for 10, and $15/ea for 20+). A student club or organization ordering 20 or more shirts can also enjoy a complimentary subscription to Bitch Magazine. Plus, it's more fun to wear your Feminist Coming Out Day gear together!

7. When can I expect to receive my shirt?
Because Feminist Coming Out Day is March 8th, we'll be sending out stickers, buttons, and tees to our first round of donors in mid-February and shipping to early contributors first. We advise student groups holding events to place final orders by February 20th and to notify us of intent to order ASAP. After the event, we'll be taking orders for remaining t-shirts until March 31st or until they run out.

8. What should I do when I receive my package of ""This Is What A Feminist Looks Like"" gear?
Take a photo or make a video of yourself wearing it and add it to our Feminist Portrait Project, along with your feminist manifesto! Put it on your Facebook profile or share it with your Twitter followers. Give your button to a sibling. Tell your friends about our website. The possibilities are endless!

9. What if I want extra stickers or buttons?
For every dollar you donate that exceeds the minimum contribution for a ""perk"" level, you can receive your choice of a button or a sticker. (For example, if you donate $21, you can receive a shirt, a button, a sticker, AND either an extra button or sticker.) Please indicate your preference in your email to feministcomingoutday@gmail.com. (Due to shipping costs,  we can only provide extra merchandise to those who pledge at least $5.) Are you a campus group or an organization? We offer stickers and buttons at significantly reduced bulk rates if they are used for a public event or as part of a Feminist Coming Out Day celebration. Please contact us for more details.

10. What if I want to order shirts in X quantity?
If you're ordering 5-9 tees, add $18 to your minimum contribution ($90) for each additional shirt. If you're ordering 10-19 tees, add $17.50 to your minimum contribution ($175) for each additional shirt. If you're ordering 20+ tees, add $15 to your minimum contribution for each additional shirt. We are not able to offer price breaks for smaller orders.

<p><strong>RICOCHET: A film about one of the most celebrated trials of our time, and the international debate over immigration policy in the U.S.</strong></p>
<p>Hi. I'm Jeff Adachi, the writer and producer of two award winning PBS feature documentary films  asking for your help to raise funds to complete the film.</p>
<p>RICOCHET is a feature length film about the tragic death of Kate Steinle. Kate was walking on Pier 14 in San Francisco with her father when a shot rang out. Seconds later, she was dead. An undocumented immigrant, Jose Garcia Zarate, was arrested and accused of murder. Within hours, then candidate Donald Trump used the case to justify his immigration policies, stating that the death of Steinle was caused by San Francisco's sanctuary city policies.  The trial of the case was one of the most watched and commented on trials of decade .</p>
<p>Matt Gonzalez, Chief Attorney of the San Francisco Public Defender's Office, is assigned the case and develops the evidence through a fascinating analysis of video evidence, forensic science and witnesses, including Garcia-Zarate.   Gonzalez is assisted by Francisco Ugarte, who heads the office's immigration unit, and the defense team.</p>
<p>The film is directed by Jeff Adachi, who has made several award winning films including ""The Slanted Screen"" and ""You Don't Know Jack Soo,"" and edited by Emmy nominated Chihiro Wimbush (""Dogtown Redemption""). </p>

The three of us went on our first international mission trip together as brothers in July 2012 with Coreluv International. <b>The trip proved to be a pivotal turning point in each of our lives, and we were enthused with passion to end the vicious epidemic we call the orphan cycle in Haiti.</b> Before the trip the three of us weren't close, but we experienced the congruent power of God's love and passion each day that brought us closer than ever. <b>We were being confronted with our true identities both individually and collectively as brothers.

<p>The concept of a traditional orphanage institution will not be cultivated through the efforts of i'mME, rather the implementation of cottages that portray the heartbeat and atmosphere of family.

<h3><strong>Our Story</strong></h3>
<div>
<p><strong>We are out to make a real impact on peace for the planet.</strong></p>
<p>We believe that the ‘Alliance for Peace Building’, as an organization can have one of the biggest impacts on peace. The Alliance (an Umbrella entity for international peace-building organizations around the world) works with over 70 companies worldwide and not only raises funds for communities, they provide organizations with education, they connect policy makers with advocacy groups and strive to create peace before atrocities actually occur.</p>
<p><strong>We are raising funds to create an impactful short film featuring celebrities and their children reciting the poem - THE TIGER AND THE DRAGON to raise awareness for peace and funds for the Alliance for Peace Building. </strong></p>
<p>The Tiger and Dragon is the playful story of 2 strong characters who discover the possibility of forgiveness and peace when they push their fear of each other aside. Animation and music will be used to illustrate the colorful story, appealing to both adults and kids.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact </strong></p>
<p>Ultimately our team hopes not only to raise funds and awareness for the Alliance for Peace building but also to inform people about the many organizations actively promoting peace around the world. The short film will be made available to global peace organizations to promote their individual peace efforts.</p>

<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>Focusing on repair rather than punishment, our mission is to create a cultural, heart-led shift in the ways we respond to sexual violence.</p>
<p>I am Marlee, the founder of this movement and the human featured in the video above! If you watched, you know that my sexual assault case concluded with a powerful restorative justice process in 2019. The man who raped me went through extensive therapy before we met in a mediation circle, focused on accountability, transformation and closure.  After experiencing more healing through this process than I even knew I needed... I am advocating for a world in which restorative justice is an accessible and well-known option following sexual assault. </p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What We Do</h3>
<p>We provide education on the power of restorative justice to centralize accountability, rehabilitation, transformation, and the voices of survivors. We raise awareness and enhance access to restorative justice for sexual violence, within the context of gender reconciliation. Through public speaking, advocacy, workshops, conferences, educational media content, and more, we uplift cultural standards of empathy and break the chains of dehumanization. </p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>

</div><p> </p></div>","Who We Are
Focusing on repair rather than punishment, our mission is to create a cultural, heart-led shift in the ways we respond to sexual violence.
I am Marlee, the founder of this movement and the human featured in the video above! If you watched, you know that my sexual assault case concluded with a powerful restorative justice process in 2019. The man who raped me went through extensive therapy before we met in a mediation circle, focused on accountability, transformation and closure.  After experiencing more healing through this process than I even knew I needed... I am advocating for a world in which restorative justice is an accessible and well-known option following sexual assault. 
 
What We Do
We provide education on the power of restorative justice to centralize accountability, rehabilitation, transformation, and the voices of survivors. We raise awareness and enhance access to restorative justice for sexual violence, within the context of gender reconciliation. Through public speaking, advocacy, workshops, conferences, educational media content, and more, we uplift cultural standards of empathy and break the chains of dehumanization. 

 
What We Need & What You Get
With your support, we can cover the startup costs required to make major impact. By contributing to this movement, you can help create a world that believes in people's capacity for transformation, centres survivors voices, lessens incarceration and enhances public safety. 

We are asking for funding to cover start-up costs, including: legal (incorporation and charity registration), graphic design (website and logo), media content (creation of educational videos to build awareness, such as the one included here), merchandise, accountant costs, payment for delegated roles (ie. donor relations, outreach), and more. 

PERKS: We are excited to offer Marlee's poetry e-book, sharing her journey through sexual violence, long-distance energy healing and online courses.

<h3>Women's Forum</h3>
<p>The Women’s Forum is an independent, non-governmental organization founded in January 2001 in Tetovo, North Macedonia. Our activities focus on raising awareness and advocating for gender equality through 2 main program areas:</p>
<p>1. Economic empowerment of women;<br/>2. Protection and promotion of human rights, focusing on women’s rights.</p>
<p>The Center for Free Legal Aid for Survivors of Domestic Violence is lead by an expert lawyer and coordinator who provide free legal advice in the Women’s Forum office and conduct educational training in the community.  Since the Center was founded in 2003, over 600 women have visited the center for free legal advice.</p>
<h3>Our Impact</h3>
<p>The Center for Free Legal Aid for Survivors of Domestic Violence has:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provided free legal aid to 648 women survivors of violence, since 2003</li>
<li>60% of who were able to successfully file legal paperwork</li>
<li>A vast majority of these survivors have children, proving that <strong>1,000s of people in the Tetovo region are affected by family violence</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p>One day, we hope that there will be an end to violence against women. For now, we are helping survivors break the cycle of violence by advising them how to access their rights against abusers. Please consider supporting the Center so we can continue to be there for survivors who need us.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Ask</h3>
<p>Over the years, it has become increasing challenging for the Women's Forum to find funding from international donors to support our activities. During March, Women's History Month, we are asking our friends, supporters, and community members to help fund the costs to operate Center for Free Legal Aid for Survivors of Domestic Violence.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>$20 donation covers the cost for 1 hour of legal counseling</strong></li>
<li>Our goal is to raise $500</li>

<h3>Our Project</h3>
<p>The mission of The Black Bookshelf Project (TBBP) is to provide our diverse and vibrant communities with easy access to anti racism resources that focus on the joy, pride, and rich cultural backgrounds of Black people, Indigenous people, and people of color; helping underline commonalities of the human experience.</p>
<p>We want to prepare our future allies to engage in tough conversations that come with anti racism work. By providing our communities with some of the basic tools required to have the difficult and sometimes uncomfortable discussions that surround race and racism (all from the comfort of their own homes) through the development of a centralized resource database that all of TBBP community members will have unrestricted access to. We hope to facilitate families and communities in building the foundations required to confidently advocate for, and uplift, all members of our local and global communities; inspiring learners of every age to continue in their anti-racism journey after coming into contact with our bookshelf.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Our Plan &amp; Our Future</h3>
</div><div>
<p>We plan to commence our work with select schools in Beaumont and Edmonton once we have acquired the necessary funds, sometime within the next 3 months.  We are offering our books and shelves at no cost to schools. Our only  requests will be that:</p>
<ol>
<li>The books on the bookshelves are catalogued for ease of access.</li>
<li>The Black Bookshelf Project sticker remains on the spines of the donated books so that they are easily returned to the same area. Schools will be provided with extra spine stickers to replace damaged or worn ones.</li>
<li>The books donated by The Black Bookshelf Project are placed, together, in a prominent location in the school, along with the signage provided by TBBP.</li>
</ol>
<p>We will be creating a waitlist for communities that are excited by this project and eager to welcome it into their libraries. We are also working towards the goal of becoming approved vendors for multiple school boards within the Edmonton Area.</p>
<p>Our goal is to continue to grow throughout the summer by collecting monetary donations through the sale of our merchandise. We will compile and collect resources for each Black Bookshelf one at a time and deliver and assemble the unit to each school or childcare center once it has been completed!</p>
<p>Knowing that the anti-racism movement is rooted in the idea of inclusion. We fully intend on expanding our libraries as our access to resources increases. We are in the process of applying for Not-for-Profit status. Once we are able to gain that status, and apply for access to the funding that is associated with it, we are hoping to expand the range of books that we are able to provide to our communities! Our hope is to one day add books that aim to celebrate and educate students on the subjects of:</p>
<ul>
<li>gender identity</li>
<li>neuro-diversity</li>
<li>ableism</li>
<li>consent</li>
<li>mental health awareness</li>
<li>environmental awareness</li>
</ul>
<p>Our list is not limited to only the subjects mentioned above. Our list will grow and evolve as the people involved grow and evolve. We firmly believe that good things take time and plan on providing our communities with as many diverse resources as we can to set them up for success in working through the important issues within our modern society.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Our Challenges</h3>
<p>Anti-racism is a tough subject to broach. The stigma surrounding racism and upholding systems of racial oppression, intentionally or not, can be a tough realization for people to come to. It may not be a realization that some ever come to. We know we won't be able to reach everyone, but we hope to reach everyone that who is willing to learn more and grow with us.</p>
<p>We plan to approach this subject in a way that showcases the flaws in our system and focuses the blame on these systems rather than putting the blame on individuals within our community. We are also hoping that by making resources available online for families to access from the comfort of their own homes, they will approach this information in a less guarded manner, knowing that they are getting credible information from reliable sources without the feeling of shame or the fear of judgment that they may anticipate having during a face to face discussion.  </p>
<p>We also know that teachers and families are overwhelmed right now - which is why we will be providing book summaries and discussion points for families and teachers to be able to access quickly if they are approached by a young learner to have a conversation about a book that they have accessed on a Black Bookshelf. The system will not be perfect initially, but it is better than nothing. We are invested in making this project work - time and resources will be put into modifying and adapting the project and the necessary resources as we uncover issues and bumps along the way.</p>
<h3>The Funds</h3>
<p>Each bookshelf costs approximately $1100.00 CAD. Whether or not we are able to meet our end goal of $7000.00 CAD, the funds will be spent on the following, listed in order of importance:</p>
<ol>
<li>Books </li>
<li>Bookshelves</li>
<li>Signage, Spine Stickers and Book Plates</li>
<li>Securing a domain and website host for The Black Bookshelf Project</li>
<li>The recruitment of lawyers and other professionals to assist us with gaining NPO status and applying for grants in the future.</li>
<li>The development of age appropriate educational resources to accompany each book</li>
<li>The development of merchandise that will help generate ongoing funding for this project once our campaign is over.</li>
</ol>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Monetary contributions help immensely, but they are not the only contributions that matter.  Times are tough and remain uncertain. If you aren't currently in a position to donate financially - here are some other ways you can support The Black Bookshelf Project:</p>
<ol>
<li>Tell your friends and family about TBBP</li>
<li>Follow us on Instagram @theblackbookshelfproject</li>
<li>Share, Like and Comment on our posts</li>
<li>Do you have any special skills? If you’re an accountant, a lawyer, a banker, or a digital marketing specialist, to name just a few, we might be able to use your help!</li>
<li>We are always on the hunt for ways to grow, but there may be opportunities we miss. Share TBBP with local business organizations or municipal governments seeking ways to help!</li>

 time is especially harsh for the homeless on the streets.  As many are 
celebrating inside their homes, the homeless are often alone on the cold
 winter streets with establishments closed for the holidays.  Throughout
 the past few years, we learned that a group of homeless chose not to 
live in shelters for a number of reasons (violence, policies, unlawful 
substances, psychological distress, financial, etc.) and this group is 
generally overlooked during Christmas time.  Our goal is to share with 
them some love, hope, joy, and happiness, and ensure that they feel 
remembered as human-beings.</p><br/><p><b>Our Mission…</b></p><p>For
 many of us, Christmas time means a holiday off school and work; a 
perfect time to relax and enjoy good music, food and prepare for the new
 year.  Each year in most major cities around the world, hundreds of 
people are living on the streets without adequate food, clothing, 
shelter and hope.  Christmas time is one of the hardest times of the 
year due to the cold weather and that establishments are closed.<br/><br/>Our
 goal is to share with them, some love, hope, items, and hopefully some 
fun.  It will be a great opportunity for us to talk with them and spread
 the true meaning and joy of Christmas.  In return, we can provide 
whatever assistance possible.  We believe that the event will not only 
provide hope, happiness and a memorable experience for the homeless, but
 also allow us to learn about people with different backgrounds.</p><p><b>The C.O.A. Story…</b></p><p>In
 the autumn of 2007, Edward Choi and Roy Wong had dinner at a London, 
Ontario restaurant one Tuesday evening.  They discussed the idea of an 
event to spread the joy of Christmas to those in need.  During prior 
years, both individuals have encountered homeless people while 
travelling across several cities in Ontario.  It was believed that 
providing them with food, clothing, other essentials and understanding 
their needs would better serve the homeless than to provide monetary 
donations alone. </p><p>They decided to approach the local 
university fellowships, the Asian Christian Fellowship (ACF) at the 
University of Western Ontario and the Laurier Chinese Christian 
Fellowship (LCCF) at Wilfrid Laurier University for support.  Both 
university fellowships supported this idea.  The first C.O.A. 
presentation was made at the ACF Christmas party and electronic 
correspondence was sent to LCCF.  During the first annual C.O.A. in 
2007, we had 7 volunteers who actively handed out 80 gift bags to the 
homeless on the streets of downtown Toronto, which was made through 
$200.45 in donated funds.</p><p>Various organizations 
partnered with us throughout the years, including the University of 
Western Ontario’s Asian Christian Fellowship, Laurier Chinese Christian 
Fellowship, the University of Toronto Chinese Christian Fellowship, 
Logos Baptist Church (Markham  ON), Second Cup (Bur Oak &amp; McCowan,

<p>GAME will provide these young people with opportunities to be at the center of the solution: to create new and affirming community activities, become advocates on their own behalf, develop a higher sense of purpose to a constructive cause, and connect with like-minded Muslim youth throughout the world to help foster a global movement.

rocket in her head from a bombing during Operation Cast Lead.  To this day this injury causes her to
bleed from her nose and she has other neurological issues as yet undiagnosed
and unresolved.  This is but one
story but it makes the point that not only memories are embedded in these
children forever, each time a jet, a drone or helicopter gunship flies overhead,
the ongoing nightmare of what may come is re-visited.  
 
I ask every parent out there to imagine
your child continuously traumatized and terrified in the name of “fighting
terrorism”.  Ask yourself how you
would feel about being continuously bombarded by the fourth largest military in
the world and having no way at all to protect your child from fear or
harm?  How would you feel?  
 
Now think about how you play a direct role
in the terrorizing of children in Palestine if you are a UK or American citizen.  Your governments continue to supply the
very same weapons used to carry out these missions.  Maybe you in particular should do something to stop this
homegrown madness, and if you are already doing something then maybe you should
do more?
 
Make no mistake; the flying of Israeli
aircraft over Palestine is in itself a form of terrorism.  Bombing with “high precision” weapons
that continue to hit innocent people is a war crime and terrorism; and this is
happening regularly.  So what the
hell are we doing about it?
 
Some may say; “what difference will a
picture make?”  Well I believe the
picture we seek to take will make a difference.  We will gather around 200 schoolchildren of Gaza on Thursday
April 21, 2011 and these children will form a human chain that will spell out
the words ‘NO FLY ZONE OVER GAZA’. 

 
As we do this let us face another shameful
fact, the NO FLY ZONE OVER LIBYA is pure, unadulterated oil stealing hypocrisy posing
as “humanitarian intervention”.  If
there were ever anything genuinely humane about Western intervention a NO FLY
ZONE OVER PALESTINE would have been implemented decades ago.  But the Palestinians have no oil, and
they certainly have no air defenses, and so the innocent people of Gaza
continue to be bombed with impunity. 
 
How bloody stupid, powerless and
hypocritical must we the people have become to allow unhindered bombings of
Palestine for decades while doing nothing effective to stop it, meanwhile sitting
back to watch a NO FLY ZONE OVER LIBYA be put into place in little more than a
week or two?  
 
Face it people, we in the West remain
staggeringly complacent and falsely inhumane when we allow such hypocrisies to
be flaunted right in front of our faces. 
And so it is that those of us who are still human are compelled to do something.    
 
Symbols have power and the extent of that
power is derived from the meaning and intensity people affix to the
symbols.  We intend to create a powerful
global symbol made of a message sent directly from the children of Gaza, to the
people of the world. Now whether the world listens and responds to these
children is yet to be seen, but at the very least we shall send this
message.  We hope that our
photograph captures the message to such an extent that people are motivated to
do more.  Ultimately seek to have
this message heeded to such a point that Israeli aircraft will no longer be
able to terrorize the people/children of Gaza/Palestine.  And if not, every single time another
Israeli bomb drops on the innocents of Palestine, this picture shall be put
forward as the demand of a truly sane and humane international community.  The true cost of bringing 200 children to the spot to form the human chain is roughly $300 but the minimum amount to request with Indiegogo is $500, thus if we receive $500 or more we will look to bring more children as we must supply travel by bus and a minimum of refreshments for the kids.  If the amount we recieve is more than needed to do what we intend to do then the remainder will be given to the Samouni Project.

<h2><b>A CHILD YOU KNOW AND LOVE MAY BE IN DANGER.  <br/></b></h2><h3><b>JOIN ME IN THE FIGHT AGAINST CHILD
EXPLOITATION.</b></h3>
<p>What would cause a pragmatic city-girl to move to the middle of farming country, hours away from friends, family, and the aerial community to work <i><b>for free</b></i> for the U.S. Attorney's Office for a year?</p><p>There could be only one thing important enough to call her to the wild - the chance to prosecute child exploitation cases (primarily child pornography/sexual abuse) on the front-lines, working to save the next generation of victims and to show those whose photos of their abuse are eternally available  in the dark vortex of the web that there are those willing to sacrifice to achieve whatever justice can be obtained on their behalf.<br/></p><p>Why is this so important? Just look at a few of the
facts:</p>
<p>-<span>  </span>An
estimated 1 in 5 girls and 1 in 10 boys in the U.S. are sexually exploited
during childhood.</p>
<p>-<span>  </span>69% of the children are sexually abused by an adult that they know and
trust. Only 4% are abused by a stranger.</p>
<p>-<span>  </span>Between
1996 and 2005, arrests for child exploitation increased 2,325% and they continue to increase.<br/></p>
<p>-<span>  </span>Nearly
50% of child pornography is produced in the United States.</p>
<p>-<span>  </span>In
a 10 yr span, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC)
reviewed and analyzed more than <b>104 million images of child pornography</b> in an
attempt to identify the victims and save them from further abuse. Many of the
children are abused violently in images depicting bondage, sadism, and torture.</p>
<p>-<span>  </span>Due
to the rapidly increasing spread of child pornography, the images are
growing  more
graphic and violent and the children being abused are getting younger and
younger.</p>
<p>-<span>  </span>In
2010, 96.3% of offenders possessed images of prepubescent minors (under the age
of 12) and 74.2% possessed sadomasochistic images. 19% of offenders possessed
images of toddlers and infants.</p>
<h3>POSSESSION OF CHILD PORNOGRAPHY IS NOT A “VICTIMLESS CRIME”</h3>
<p>The global child pornography market is a 3 billion dollar
industry that has attracted organized crime. But it doesn’t stop with career crimnals.
Advances in technology have allowed for the creation of hidden websites where
offenders can purchase or trade child pornographic images anonymously, knowing
that it is very difficult for law enforcement to track them down, attracting offenders from all walks of life.<br/></p>
<p>In order to be allowed access to other offenders’
collections of photographs, online community members must provide newer and
more graphic images to share (and to show that they are not members of law
enforcement). Because they have found a community that accepts them and
encourages them to produce new materials, offenders quickly evolve from mere
viewers to producers.</p>
<h4>STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT ANYWHERE FROM 30% TO 80% OF
POSSESSORS OF CHILD PORNOGRAPHY EVOLVE INTO HAVING SEXUAL CONTACT WITH
CHILDREN. One study found that 76% of individuals arrested for possession of
Internet child pornography admitted to sexually molesting a child.</h4>
<h3>VICTIMS ARE PERPETUALLY VICTIMIZED</h3>
<p>Psychological problems experienced by child victims continue
well into adulthood, as they have been victimized both by the original abusive
acts and then repetitively by the knowledge that images of their abuse will permanently
reside on the Internet, where the images can be viewed and used for sexual gratification by new offenders ad infinitum.</p>
<p>Most law enforcement agencies at all levels have dedicated
divisions to uncovering these crimes and bringing the offenders to justice, but
even with their combined efforts they focus their resources on those that they
deem to be the worst and most dangerous offenders. </p>
<p>The prosecution for these offenders generally falls on the
U.S. Attorney’s Office. Unfortunately, the cases keep increasing despite budgetary shortfalls. As a result, the U.S. Attorney’s Office has created <b>voluntary</b> prosecuting attorney positions to help handle the
increase in criminal caseloads.</p>
<p>This is what I want to do! This is what I need your help to
do!</p>
<h3>WHY ME?</h3>
<p>In 1989 my class was assigned to clip out images from
magazines representing the path we wanted out lives to take. Among the
Cosmopolitans and House &amp; Gardens I managed to find a cartoon of an
attorney standing before a judge and place it next to an image of a crying
child.</p>
<p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/611113/files/20140528222930-Image_1.jpg?1401341370"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p>
<p>On the back we were to tell our story. I wrote that I wanted
to study law at UCLA while getting a tan (I always was a multitasker), then
become a prosecutor and fight for victims, particularly child victims.</p>
<p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/611120/files/20140528223312-collage_words_copy.jpg?1401341592"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p>
<p>Although my life took a windy path full of unexpected
twists, turns and even some detours, I did graduate from UCLA School of Law in
2008 where I received recognition for my litigation skills. I have spent
considerable time volunteering for the City and District Attorney’s Offices in
my quest to protect the vulnerable.</p>
<p>Now I am eager to join the fight against child
exploitation on the front -ines. Believe me, to move a big city girl to the
country, away from friends and family, to work for free was not anything I had
ever anticipated doing, but I know in my heart this is something I need to do.
I humbly ask you for your help.</p>
<p>As I said before, the prosecution position I have been
offered is uncompensated, meaning I will be working long hours preparing cases
for trial, <b><i>for free</i></b>. Not something I would have considered if not for the possibility to use the skills that I have selectively obtained in order to be able to help save children from abuse. That time is now. </p>
<p>But I need help to make this possible.</p>
<p>The reality is that no matter how sparsely I try to live, I
cannot exist on my passion for the work alone. The more I can raise here, the
less I will have to worry about how to cover the costs of necessities and the
more I will be able to focus on the work. 
</p>
<p>My initial goal here is to make enough to cover rent (approximately $12,000/year), health
and car insurance (approximately $10, 080/year), a little more than half of what my anticipated basic living
expenses for the year will be. </p>
<p>If the goal is exceeded, I will also be able to pay for food, medicine, gasoline, dry-cleaning
and other necessities for my puppies and myself, allowing me to concentrate on
the work that I will be doing. I will also be looking for ways to bring in
income and decrease expenses.</p>
<p>Should the amount I receive exceed my living expenses for
the year, I plan to give the remainder to other charities that work towards
ending child exploitation, like the Center for Missing and Exploited Children, that maintains a tipline that receives millions of calls that require investigation to determine if a child can be identified so that he or she can receive help.<br/></p>
<h3>HOW CAN YOU HELP?</h3>
<p>-<span>  </span>Obviously,
a monetary donation will do the most to help send me on my way to the U.S. Attorney’s Office.
Be creative – I’ve had friends already offer to hold bake sales and brainstorm
other creative ways to raise money for this campaign.</p>
<p>-<span>  </span>Share
my campaign on your social media sites. If you know me or have known a victim,
personalize your post so that others understand why this is so important to you
and to your community.</p>
<p>-<span>  </span>Educate
yourself and others. While this alone won’t help me get to Fresno, knowing the
facts and sharing them creates an awareness that will extend far beyond this
campaign and that awareness may help save a child from victimization and abuse.</p><p>- Unlike other crowdfunding campaigns, I am not raising funds to produce a product or event, so it does not lend itself to the ""perk"" system. If you have a perk that you would like to donate to help me thank other donors, I would appreciate it and would obviously thank you and promote you on my facebook page in appreciation for your donation.</p><p>If you would like more information on this subject, please check out my facebook page (click FB button below).<br/></p>
<p>I hope you will consider donating, sharing and encouraging your

The attack has left him beaten, bruised, bewildered and now it threatens to leave him broke to boot.With your assistance I hope to raise enough money to cover his costs so that this heinous act of violence does not cost him any more than it already has in dignity, blood and teeth.What We Need From YouAnything you can spare really, even a single dollar brings us closer to our goal and every little bit helps and is greatly appreciated.Any additional funds that we receive above and beyond the costs will be 
donated to groups that are against violence and discrimination toward 
the LGBT community and people in general.

Violence
We have all been touched by violence in some way in our lives no matter who we are, or what creed or life choices we follow whether personally, through friends and family or through hearing it on the news. It affects us all and we feel it as a community. 
When acts like these are perpetrated it's easy to become jaded and think that there is no good left in the world, but that's where you come in! You can make a difference! You can be the hero that rights the wrong and saves the day! You have an opportunity to help get one victim back on his feet with a smile on his face and that can make a world of difference.


Other Ways You Can Help
If you just can't afford to spare any money, we understand, times are tight and bills need to get paid. While we will sincerely appreciate every cent that comes in, you can also help by spreading this around and getting the word out. There are bad people in this world, let's not let them win!

Post this on your social media site of choice and encourage your friends to check it out and help if they can.
Use the Indiegogo share tools to help us spread the word!


Thank you to any and all supporters from the deepest parts of my heart for your kindness and generosity, you are what's good in this world!

She was guided through the camp by Mr. Jordan Parker, a refugee himself and a minister at the camp (<a href=""http://gtinternational.webs.com/aboutthefounder.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Jordan Parker"">http://gtinternational.webs.com/aboutthefounder.htm</a>)</p>
<p>Because of the closure of the Buduburam refugee camp in Ghana, many Liberian refugees will become illegal aliens if they can not return home.</p>
<p>We have stayed in touch with Mr. Jordan Parker, and I have asked him if there was a way to be able to help him and his people in their situation.</p>
<p>This campaign is an effort to help 19 of these refugees return home to Liberia, avoiding being detained as illegals in Ghana.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>

My wife - who works for a humanitarian organization - travelled to Ghana last month and was very touched by the Liberian people that need to be relocated from the closing Buduburam refugee camp. She was guided through the camp by Mr. Jordan Parker, a refugee himself and a minister at the camp (http://gtinternational.webs.com/aboutthefounder.htm)
Because of the closure of the Buduburam refugee camp in Ghana, many Liberian refugees will become illegal aliens if they can not return home.
We have stayed in touch with Mr. Jordan Parker, and I have asked him if there was a way to be able to help him and his people in their situation.
This campaign is an effort to help 19 of these refugees return home to Liberia, avoiding being detained as illegals in Ghana.
What We Need & What You Get
Initially, 21 of their members needed transportation assistance. Two of them were transported recently by one pastor who saw the need. Now we are talking about 19 persons who still need help now to go back home.
Each of them needs $165.00(USD) to go back home. This means that all 19 of them will need $3,135.00USD. If funding is available, they will take them by road as going by air is very expensive indeed. It will take them 3 days to reach home on Bus.
We're asking for $3,500 to cover this plus incidentals including the cost to transfer the money.
If the target is not reached, at least each $165 will allow 1 refugee to return home.
PS I understand that something like this may sound a bit fishy, especially with the usual Nigerian email scams out there, however this is all very real. If you have any doubts, please feel free to contact me on my cell phone and I can vouch for it. (604 809 4252)

<p><span style=""font-family: 'Droid Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: small;""> </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Droid Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: small;"">For over a decade, the City of Fresno has been home to thousands of homeless people who live in communities known as 'tent cities' or 'encampments.' Pam Kincaid was a prominent leader &amp; activist for Fresno's homeless community. In 2006, she was the lead-plaintiff in a class-action lawsuit that was filed against the City of Fresno for street clean-ups that resulted in the immediate destruction of homeless property that sometimes included valuable personal items like family photos, clothes and urns with the remains of loved ones.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: small; font-family: 'Droid Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;""> </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: small; font-family: 'Droid Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"">In 2008, the lawsuit resulted in the biggest settlement for homeless defendants in U.S. history, requiring the City of Fresno to pay 2.3 million dollars. Unfortunately, Kincaid did not live to see this historic victory. On August 1, 2007, Kincaid died under mysterious circumstances after falling to her death from a 4th story balcony at a local hospital.</span></p>

My name is Mariano Marquez III. I'm a San Francisco filmmaker who's shooting a documentary feature about the homeless situation in Central California's City of Fresno. After witnessing the overwhelming circumstances of thousands of homeless people in downtown Fresno, I knew I had to go a step further beyond filmmaking. That's why I established the Pam Kincaid Memorial Fund. If you would like to know more about me, please read my Artist Statement:
 
http://www.lightningraypictures.com/about
 
This campaign is sponsored by the Eco Village Project of Fresno, a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization. The board of directors of the Eco Village Project of Fresno include:
 

Arthur Dyson
Mike Rhodes
Dixie Salazar
Gerry Bill
 
Mike Rhodes is editor of Fresno's Community Alliance newspaper and an activist for homeless rights. Dixie Salazar is a local artist frequently seen reaching out to Fresno's homeless community, while Gerry Bill is Professor Emeritus of Fresno City College and a longtime activist. Finally, Arthur Dyson is a world-renowned architect and Dean Emeritus of the Frank Lloyd Wright School of Architecture. Dyson has designed a plan for green and sustainable Eco Villages. His vision not only offers a solution to end global homelessness, but a blueprint for job training and self-empowerment.
 
The Pam Kincaid Story
 
For over a decade, the City of Fresno has been home to thousands of homeless people who live in communities known as 'tent cities' or 'encampments.' Pam Kincaid was a prominent leader & activist for Fresno's homeless community. In 2006, she was the lead-plaintiff in a class-action lawsuit that was filed against the City of Fresno for street clean-ups that resulted in the immediate destruction of homeless property that sometimes included valuable personal items like family photos, clothes and urns with the remains of loved ones.
 
In 2008, the lawsuit resulted in the biggest settlement for homeless defendants in U.S. history, requiring the City of Fresno to pay 2.3 million dollars. Unfortunately, Kincaid did not live to see this historic victory. On August 1, 2007, Kincaid died under mysterious circumstances after falling to her death from a 4th story balcony at a local hospital.

The Mission
 
The mission of the Pam Kincaid Memorial Fund is to provide Fresno's homeless with a respectable standard of living via basic services. Our current funding goal is a starting point for Project Homeless Dignity. As the Eco Village Project of Fresno works towards housing the homeless, these funds will provide hundreds of homeless people with access to things like portable toilets, trash bins, sleeping bags, covers, clothes, food and bottled water for 1 year. It will cost much more to accomplish this goal, but about $15,000 has already been covered by the generous contributions of local donors. With your help, we can go beyond our starting point of $16,500. The more we exceed our goal, the greater the impact on our homeless community.
 
All donations are tax-deductible. Campaign contributions go directly to the Eco Village Project of Fresno, a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization. Members of the Eco Village Project of Fresno believe wholeheartedly in the mission of the United Nations:
 
""Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social services, and the right to security in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age or other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control.""
— Article 25, Universal Declaration of Human Rights
 
The Message
 
If you can't donate to the fund, the best way to help is by spreading the word. We believe everyone has a right to help however they can, whenever they can. If you have an account on Twitter, Facebook, Google+, a blog or any other form of social media... you can be a member of this campaign. As a special thanks to those who help get the word out, you'll receive website credit as:
'Messenger of the Homeless'

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><i>Vorab weise ich darauf hin, dass ich hier nicht unsere Regierung als diskriminierend hinstellen möchte. Ich bin der Meinung, dass aufgrund der generell hohen Anzahl an Flüchtlingen derzeit viele Dinge nicht bearbeitet werden können. Es mangelt an Personal und oftmals herrscht Chaos.</i></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Jeder Flüchtling, egal ob hetero, schwul, lesbisch, bisexuell, transsexuell, verheiratet, mit oder ohne Kinder wird derzeit in Erstaufnahmeeinrichtungen in ganz Deutschland verteilt und untergebracht. Hier müssen alle ankommenden Flüchtlinge verweilen, bis der Staat Ihre Registrierung aufgenommen hat. Dies dauert aufgrund der derzeit hohen Anzahl an Flüchtlingen oftmals Monate. Auch bis über den Asylantrag entschieden wurde vergehen nochmals mehrere Monate. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Alle Flüchtlinge, die aufgrund von Krieg und Verfolgung fliehen, bekommen eine Aufenthaltserlaubnis. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Erstaufnahmeeinrichtungen sind umfunktionierte Wohnheime, Zeltstädte im Freien, oder bestehende Gebäude (umfunktionierte Turnhallen oder Kasernen). </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Hier werden alle Flüchtlinge, auch LGBT-Flüchtlinge untergebracht. Es gibt keine Privatsphäre: Bis zu zehn Personen werden in beengten Zimmern mit Stockbetten untergebracht. Hunderte Flüchtlinge müssen in Turnhallen leben und übernachten – ohne eine trennende und schützende Wand.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Behinderte Flüchtlinge, allein reisende Flüchtlingsfrauen und Flüchtlingsmütter mit Kindern gelten in unserem Land als besonders schutzbedürftig. Diese kommen in separate Hotels oder besonders geschützte und betreute Einrichtungen.</p>
<p><u>LGBT-Flüchtlinge werden nicht als besonders schutzbedürftig anerkannt. </u></p>
<p>Oftmals erfahren wir, dass insbesondere schwule, lesbische und bisexuelle Flüchtlinge ihre Sexualität verheimlichen sollen. Da dies einer der Gründe der Flucht ist, ist das für uns als Rainbow Refugees Organisation nicht ok. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Die LGBT-Flüchtlinge wohnen oftmals mit den Menschen in Erstaufnahmeeinrichtungen zusammen, vor denen Sie geflohen sind. Landsleute, die verachtend über LGBT´s denken und handgreiflich gegenüber LGBT-Flüchtlingen werden.</p>
<p><b>Und hier endet mein Verständnis!</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Es kann nicht sein, dass LGBT-Flüchtlinge in unser Land fliehen und hier in den Erstaufnahmeeinrichtungen, in denen sie mind. 6 Monate oder meist länger als ein Jahr verweilen müssen, von ihren Landsleuten bespuckt, verprügelt, mit Steinen beworfen und ausgegrenzt werden. Das akzeptiere ich in unserem Land nicht. Wenn unsere Regierung dieses Thema nicht in Angriff nimmt, dann möchte ich wenigstens gemeinsam mit dem Schwulenberatungszentrum Berlin, dem LSVD und dem CSD in Dresden den Menschen helfen, bei denen es am Schlimmsten ist.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Der CSD Dresden betreut derzeit 30 LGBT-Flüchtlinge. Weitere 4 LGBT-Flüchtlinge werden kurzfristig hinzu kommen. Die Schwulenberatung Berlin betreut derzeit  70 Flüchtlinge. Jedoch sind es noch viele mehr, die wir ohne eure Unterstützung nicht betreuen können.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Gemeinsam mit eurer Unterstützung holen wir die LGBT-Flüchtlinge aus den Erstaufnahmeeinrichtungen raus und bringen Sie sicher unter.</p>

<h3><a rel=""noopener nofollow"">Fakten </a></h3>
<div>
<a rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><h3>
<a rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a rel=""noopener nofollow"">Warum in Dollar?</a>
</h3>Indiegogo bietet die Unterstützung mit Kreditkarte nicht in EURO an. Daher haben wir uns entschieden, die Kampagne in Dollar auszuführen. </div>
<h3>
<a rel=""noopener nofollow""><br/></a><a rel=""noopener nofollow"">1. LGBT Flüchtlinge</a>
</h3>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Laut Umfragen sind mindestens ein Prozent aller Menschen lesbisch, schwul, bisexuell oder transsexuell. Schätzungen kommen auf fünf bis zehn Prozent. Von den 1.000.000 Flüchtlingen, die 2015 nach Deutschland kommen, müssten also mindestens 10.000 dieser Gruppe angehören. Die tatsächliche Zahl solcher Schutzsuchenden wird aufgrund der extrem hohen Todesgefahr, in der sich LGBT-Flüchtlinge etwa in radikalislamischen ISIS-Gebieten und dem Iran befinden, höher sein.</p>
<h3><a rel=""noopener nofollow"">2. Wovor fliehen Sie? </a></h3>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In Kriegsgebieten, die vom IS besetzt werden, müssen Schwule, Lesben Bisexuelle und Transsexuelle mit der Todesstrafe durch Steinigung oder Hinrichtung rechnen. Die Angst vor Verfolgung und Tod, teilweise durch die eigene Familie, ist so akut, dass ihnen nur noch die Flucht bleibt. Oftmals fliehen sie vor Verfolgung, Krieg, Diskriminierung oder einer Gesellschaft, die LGBT`s nicht aktzeptiert.</p>
<h3><a rel=""noopener nofollow"">3. Woher kommen die LGBT-Flüchtlinge?</a></h3>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Die LGBT-Flüchtlinge kommen teilweise aus Kriegsgebieten wie Syrien, Libyen, Afghanistan, Pakistan und der Ukraine. Aber auch aus Ländern, in denen die sexuelle Orientierung von LGBT´s unter Strafe steht, z.B. Russland.</p>
<h3><a rel=""noopener nofollow"">4. Wieso fliehen Sie nach Deutschland?</a></h3>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Deutschland ist ein liberales Land. Unsere Gesellschaft akzeptiert und toleriert LGBT´s. In Deutschland feiern wir jährlich in verschiedenen Städten den Christopher Street Day, der mittlerweile auch von vielen Familien mit Kindern besucht wird. Viele der beliebtesten Komiker, TV Unterhalter und Stars in unserem Land sind schwul, lesbisch, bisexuell oder transsexuell und stehen offen zu ihrem Lebensstil. Auch in der Politik muss man sich nicht mehr verstecken.</p>
<h3><a rel=""noopener nofollow"">5. Wie kommen die LGBT-Flüchtlinge in unser Land?</a></h3>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Die LGBT-Flüchtlinge kommen meistens nach einer gefährlichen Überquerung des Mittelmeeres in der EU an.  Die weitere Reise nach Deutschland erfolgt zu Fuß.  Alles, was sie noch besitzen ist ihre Kleidung, Ausweisdokumente und ein Handy.</p>
<h3><a rel=""noopener nofollow"">6. Aktuelle Situation der LGBT-Flüchtlingshilfe</a></h3>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Nachdem wir die LGBT-Flüchtlinge aus den Erstaufnahmeeinrichtungen rausgeholt haben werden diese derzeit bei ehrenamtlichen Helfern und privaten Unterstützern untergebracht. Diese Möglichkeiten sind jedoch stark begrenzt und nur für wenige Tage verfügbar. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Das ist jedoch keine Dauerlösung und reicht nicht aus, um alle LGBT-Flüchtlinge, die derzeit in Deutschland ankommen und noch zu uns kommen werden, dauerhaft sicher außerhalb der Erstaufnahmeeinrichtungen unterzubringen. Behördengänge, Sprach- und Integrationskurse erfolgen oftmals auf ehrenamtlicher Basis und sind nicht ausreichend. Gemeinsam mit eurer Unterstützung werden wir  unser Programm ausweiten.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In Berlin haben LGBT-Flüchtlinge tagsüber die Möglichkeit in der Tagesstätte des Schwulenberatungszentrum Zeit zu verbringen, müssen jedoch Abends wieder zurück in die Erstaufnahmeeinrichtungen.</p>
<h3><a rel=""noopener nofollow"">7. Wofür wird eure Unterstützung verwendet?</a></h3>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Derzeit gibt es diese ganze Unterstützung bereits auf freiwilliger Basis, aber diese reicht nicht aus. Viele Freiwillige können nicht wochenlang umsonst arbeiten, da sie selbst von etwas leben müssen. Auch Wohnungen werden von uns freiwillig gestellt, meist für ein bis zwei Wochen. Das reicht leider nicht aus, um den LGBT-Flüchtlingen eine dauerhafte und sichere Wohnlösung zu bieten.</p>
<p>Eure Unterstützung kommt zielgerichtet an:</p>
<p><b><i>Anlaufstellen</i></b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Derzeit koordinieren wir bundesweit Anlaufstellen für LGBT-Flüchtlinge. Dadurch können Mitarbeiter von Erstaufnahmeeinrichtungen direkt an uns wenden.</p>
<p><b><i>Sicherer Wohnraum und Schutz vor LGBT feindlichen Flüchtlingen</i></b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Um die LGBT-Flüchtlinge aus den Erstaufnahmeeinrichtungen rauszuholen, müssen wir als alternative Lösung Wohnungen anmieten, Heizkosten bezahlen und etwas Einrichtung bereitstellen. Allerdings sind unsere finanziellen Mittel im Moment stark begrenzt. </p>
<p><b><i>Psychologische Betreuung</i></b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Teilweise begegnen uns die LGBT-Flüchtlinge mit einem schweren Trauma. Mit eurer Unterstützung bezahlen wir dringend notwendige psychologischer Unterstützung. Nur durch professionelle, psychologische Betreuung kann das Erlebte aufgearbeitet werden.</p>
<p><b><i>Dolmetscher &amp; Behördengänge</i></b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Die LGBT-Flüchtlinge sprechen oft schlechtes Englisch oder können sich nur in Ihrer Landessprache verständigen. Wir werden Dolmetscher engagieren um Behördengänge möglich zu machen.</p>
<p><b><i>Einfach mal einen schönen Tag erleben</i></b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Mit eurer Hilfe würde ich gerne ein Lächeln verschenken. Ein Lächeln nach einem schönen Tag.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Wenn ich ehrlich bin würde ich den Jungs und Mädels, die zu uns kommen und so viel Schlimmes erlebt haben einfach mal einen schönen Tag ermöglichen. Einen Tag im Zoo oder Kino. In der Hoffnung, dass sie auf andere Gedanken kommen können und nicht ganz so alleine sind.</p>
<p><b><i>Sprach- und Integrationskurse</i></b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Die staatlichen Sprach- und Integrationskurse sind überfüllt und man wartet Monate auf eine Zuteilung. Mit eurer Unterstützung beschleunigen wir die Integration und versuchen eigene Sprach- und Integrationskurse in Zusammenarbeit mit dem Schwulenberatungszentrum Berlin und dem CSD Dresden zu organisieren.</p>
<p><b><i>LGBT-Flüchtlingsheim</i></b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Mein bzw. unser größter Wunsch wäre es von eurer Unterstützung ein Heim für mehrere LGBT-Flüchtlinge dauerhaft anmieten zu können und den deutschen Staat damit unter Druck zu setzen. Dieser muss endlich handeln und LGBT-Flüchtlinge als besonders schützenswerte Flüchtlinge anerkennen.</p>
<h3><a rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>8. </i>Was uns antreibt </a></h3>
<p>Jeder von uns LGBT´s ist in seinem Leben bereits ein- oder mehrmals ausgegrenzt oder Opfer von Gewalttaten geworden. Oftmals nur, weil wir so sind wie wir sind. Ein nicht sehr schönes Gefühl. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">-&gt; Stellt euch vor, Ihr würdet in einem Land leben, in dem Ihr verfolgt, öffentlich schikaniert und für eure Persönlichkeit gesteinigt und ermordet werdet. Und dann kann es nicht sein, dass Regenbogen Flüchtlinge zu uns kommen, in der Hoffnung in einem liberalen Land wie Deutschland Schutz und Freiheit zu finden und hier in den Erstaufnahmeeinrichtungen exakt das Gleiche erleben müssen wie in ihrer Heimat. Das darf in unserem Land keinem LGBT-Flüchtling wiederfahren!</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Wir können alle mit den LGBT-Flüchtlingen mitfühlen. Wenn wir uns in deren Lage versetzen wären wir dankbar, wenn wir von Gleichgesinnten aufgefangen und unterstützt werden. Und uns diese Gleichgesinnten auch bei Integration und Behördengängen helfen.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">LGBT-Flüchtlinge kommen mit nichts nach Deutschland. Sie kehren ihrem alten Leben den Rücken. Sie kommen zu uns, weil Sie frei sein wollen. Hier dürfen Sie sein, wie sie sind.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Wieso ich mich an euch wende? Weil ich in der Hoffnung bin das wir, alle LGBT´s in der Welt, zusammenhalten und gemeinsam etwas erreichen können und ein Statement setzen.</p>
<p>Jeder Beitrag zählt. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Falls ihr uns zu dem Thema bekannter machen könnt ist dies auch ein großer Beitrag für uns um auf unser aktuelles Thema aufmerksam zu machen.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Danke :)</p>

I am of the opinion that there are a large number of issues that can’t be dealt with currently due to the large number of refugees involved. We lack personnel, often resulting in chaotic situations.</i></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Every refugee, no matter whether they are heterosexual, gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, married, a parent, or single, is currently being distributed across Germany to refugee reception centers where they are housed. All incoming refugees have to wait in these centers until the state has accepted their registration. Due to the high number of incoming refugees at the present, this can often take months. Making a decision on an asylum application can also take many additional months.</p><p>All refugees fleeing due to war and persecution receive a residency permit.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Refugee reception centers are repurposed dormitories, tent cities outdoors, or existing buildings (repurposed gymnasiums or barracks).</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">All refugees, including LGBT refugees, are housed in these facilities. There is no private sphere: up to 10 people stay in narrow rooms filled with bunk beds. Hundreds of refugees have to live in gymnasiums, where they spend the night without walls to separate or protect them.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Handicapped refugees, refugee women traveling alone, and refugee mothers with children are granted special protections in our country. They are housed in separate hotels or in facilities that provide additional protection and supervision.</p><p><u>LGBT refugees are not recognized as deserving of special protection. </u></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">We often hear that gay, lesbian, and bisexual refugees feel they have to hide their sexuality. Since this is one of the reasons they become refugees in the first place, we at the Rainbow Refugees organization feel this is a major problem.  </p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">LGBT refugees often live together in refugee housing facilities with exactly the people they are attempting to flee. These are their countrymen, who might despise LGBT people and even become violent against LGBT refugees.</p><h4><b><a rel=""noopener nofollow"">This is where my sympathy ends!</a></b></h4><p style=""text-align: justify;"">It can’t be true that LGBT refugees flee to our country, only to spend at least six months – usually longer than a year – in a reception center where they might be spit on, beaten, hit with stones, and ostracized by their countrymen.

LGBT refugees </a></h3>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">According
to surveys, at least one percent of all people are lesbian, gay, bisexual, or
transgender. Estimates can even reach as high as five to ten percent. Of the
1,000,000 refugees coming to Germany within 2015, this means that at least
10,000 individuals belong to this group. Due to the extremely severe level of
life-threatening danger LGBT refugees face in radicalized ISIS-held areas and
in Iran, the actual number of individuals seeking protection is likely higher.</p>
<h3><a rel=""noopener nofollow"">2.<span> </span>What are they fleeing from?</a></h3>
<p></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In war-torn
areas occupied by IS, gays, lesbians, bisexuals, and transgender individuals
are exposed to the death penalty through stoning or summary execution. The fear
of persecution and death, sometimes at the hands of a person’s own family, is
so acute that the only path remaining to them is to escape. They are often
fleeing persecution, war, discrimination, or a society that doesn’t accept the
LGBT “lifestyle.”</p>
<h3><a rel=""noopener nofollow"">3.<span> </span>Where do LGBT refugees come from?</a></h3>
<p></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Some
LGBT refugees come from war-torn areas such as Syria, Libya, Afghanistan,
Pakistan, and Ukraine. But some come from other areas in which those with LGBT
sexual orientations and gender expressions are punished, such as Russia.</p>
<h3><a rel=""noopener nofollow"">4.<span> </span>Why are they fleeing to Germany? </a></h3><p style=""text-align: justify;"">
Germany is a liberal country. Our society accepts and tolerates LGBT people. We
celebrate Christopher Street Day in Germany every year in cities across the
country, a festival even visited by families with children. Many of our
country’s most beloved comedians, TV personalities, and stars are gay, lesbian,
bisexual, or transgender, and live in a very open manner. Not even politicians
need to hide their identities today.</p>
<h3><a rel=""noopener nofollow"">5.<span> 
</span>How do LGBT refugees reach our
country?</a></h3>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">LGBT
refugees usually come to the EU after a dangerous journey across the

Es kann nicht sein, dass LGBT-Flüchtlinge in unser Land fliehen und hier in den Erstaufnahmeeinrichtungen, in denen sie mind. 6 Monate oder meist länger als ein Jahr verweilen müssen, von ihren Landsleuten bespuckt, verprügelt, mit Steinen beworfen und ausgegrenzt werden. Das akzeptiere ich in unserem Land nicht.

Rainbow Refugees hilft ankommenden LGBT-Flüchtlingen in Deutschland in ein neues Leben zu starten.

Wer ist Rainbow Refugees?
Rainbow Refugees ist ein Zusammenschluss aus mehreren LGBTi- Organisationen und Vereinen in Deutschland. Gemeinsam setzen wir uns auf Bundesebene für den besonderen Schutz der schwulen, lesbischen, bisexuellen und transsexuellen (LGBT) Flüchtlinge ein und helfen in Deutschland ankommenden LGBT-Flüchtlingen:



CSD-Dresden  (der CSD Dresden kümmert sich nicht nur um die CSD Parade sondern übernimmt im Land wachsen die Vorreiterrolle in der LGBT Flüchtlings Problematik und kümmert sich aktiv vor Ort um LGT Flüchtlinge)

LSVD (Lesben und Schwulenverband in Deutschland)
Schwulenberatungszentrum Berlin  
Rainbow Refugees Karlsruhe
Vorwort
Vorab weise ich darauf hin, dass ich hier nicht unsere Regierung als diskriminierend hinstellen möchte. Ich bin der Meinung, dass aufgrund der generell hohen Anzahl an Flüchtlingen derzeit viele Dinge nicht bearbeitet werden können. Es mangelt an Personal und oftmals herrscht Chaos.
Jeder Flüchtling, egal ob hetero, schwul, lesbisch, bisexuell, transsexuell, verheiratet, mit oder ohne Kinder wird derzeit in Erstaufnahmeeinrichtungen in ganz Deutschland verteilt und untergebracht. Hier müssen alle ankommenden Flüchtlinge verweilen, bis der Staat Ihre Registrierung aufgenommen hat. Dies dauert aufgrund der derzeit hohen Anzahl an Flüchtlingen oftmals Monate. Auch bis über den Asylantrag entschieden wurde vergehen nochmals mehrere Monate. 
Alle Flüchtlinge, die aufgrund von Krieg und Verfolgung fliehen, bekommen eine Aufenthaltserlaubnis. 
Erstaufnahmeeinrichtungen sind umfunktionierte Wohnheime, Zeltstädte im Freien, oder bestehende Gebäude (umfunktionierte Turnhallen oder Kasernen). 
Hier werden alle Flüchtlinge, auch LGBT-Flüchtlinge untergebracht. Es gibt keine Privatsphäre: Bis zu zehn Personen werden in beengten Zimmern mit Stockbetten untergebracht. Hunderte Flüchtlinge müssen in Turnhallen leben und übernachten – ohne eine trennende und schützende Wand.
Behinderte Flüchtlinge, allein reisende Flüchtlingsfrauen und Flüchtlingsmütter mit Kindern gelten in unserem Land als besonders schutzbedürftig. Diese kommen in separate Hotels oder besonders geschützte und betreute Einrichtungen.
LGBT-Flüchtlinge werden nicht als besonders schutzbedürftig anerkannt. 
Oftmals erfahren wir, dass insbesondere schwule, lesbische und bisexuelle Flüchtlinge ihre Sexualität verheimlichen sollen. Da dies einer der Gründe der Flucht ist, ist das für uns als Rainbow Refugees Organisation nicht ok. 
Die LGBT-Flüchtlinge wohnen oftmals mit den Menschen in Erstaufnahmeeinrichtungen zusammen, vor denen Sie geflohen sind. Landsleute, die verachtend über LGBT´s denken und handgreiflich gegenüber LGBT-Flüchtlingen werden.
Und hier endet mein Verständnis!
Es kann nicht sein, dass LGBT-Flüchtlinge in unser Land fliehen und hier in den Erstaufnahmeeinrichtungen, in denen sie mind. 6 Monate oder meist länger als ein Jahr verweilen müssen, von ihren Landsleuten bespuckt, verprügelt, mit Steinen beworfen und ausgegrenzt werden. Das akzeptiere ich in unserem Land nicht. Wenn unsere Regierung dieses Thema nicht in Angriff nimmt, dann möchte ich wenigstens gemeinsam mit dem Schwulenberatungszentrum Berlin, dem LSVD und dem CSD in Dresden den Menschen helfen, bei denen es am Schlimmsten ist.Der CSD Dresden betreut derzeit 30 LGBT-Flüchtlinge. Weitere 4 LGBT-Flüchtlinge werden kurzfristig hinzu kommen. Die Schwulenberatung Berlin betreut derzeit  70 Flüchtlinge. Jedoch sind es noch viele mehr, die wir ohne eure Unterstützung nicht betreuen können.
Gemeinsam mit eurer Unterstützung holen wir die LGBT-Flüchtlinge aus den Erstaufnahmeeinrichtungen raus und bringen Sie sicher unter.

Fakten 


Warum in Dollar?
Indiegogo bietet die Unterstützung mit Kreditkarte nicht in EURO an. Daher haben wir uns entschieden, die Kampagne in Dollar auszuführen. 

1. LGBT Flüchtlinge

Laut Umfragen sind mindestens ein Prozent aller Menschen lesbisch, schwul, bisexuell oder transsexuell. Schätzungen kommen auf fünf bis zehn Prozent. Von den 1.000.000 Flüchtlingen, die 2015 nach Deutschland kommen, müssten also mindestens 10.000 dieser Gruppe angehören. Die tatsächliche Zahl solcher Schutzsuchenden wird aufgrund der extrem hohen Todesgefahr, in der sich LGBT-Flüchtlinge etwa in radikalislamischen ISIS-Gebieten und dem Iran befinden, höher sein.
2. Wovor fliehen Sie? 
In Kriegsgebieten, die vom IS besetzt werden, müssen Schwule, Lesben Bisexuelle und Transsexuelle mit der Todesstrafe durch Steinigung oder Hinrichtung rechnen. Die Angst vor Verfolgung und Tod, teilweise durch die eigene Familie, ist so akut, dass ihnen nur noch die Flucht bleibt. Oftmals fliehen sie vor Verfolgung, Krieg, Diskriminierung oder einer Gesellschaft, die LGBT`s nicht aktzeptiert.
3. Woher kommen die LGBT-Flüchtlinge?
Die LGBT-Flüchtlinge kommen teilweise aus Kriegsgebieten wie Syrien, Libyen, Afghanistan, Pakistan und der Ukraine. Aber auch aus Ländern, in denen die sexuelle Orientierung von LGBT´s unter Strafe steht, z.B. Russland.
4. Wieso fliehen Sie nach Deutschland?
Deutschland ist ein liberales Land. Unsere Gesellschaft akzeptiert und toleriert LGBT´s. In Deutschland feiern wir jährlich in verschiedenen Städten den Christopher Street Day, der mittlerweile auch von vielen Familien mit Kindern besucht wird. Viele der beliebtesten Komiker, TV Unterhalter und Stars in unserem Land sind schwul, lesbisch, bisexuell oder transsexuell und stehen offen zu ihrem Lebensstil. Auch in der Politik muss man sich nicht mehr verstecken.
5. Wie kommen die LGBT-Flüchtlinge in unser Land?
Die LGBT-Flüchtlinge kommen meistens nach einer gefährlichen Überquerung des Mittelmeeres in der EU an.  Die weitere Reise nach Deutschland erfolgt zu Fuß.  Alles, was sie noch besitzen ist ihre Kleidung, Ausweisdokumente und ein Handy.
6. Aktuelle Situation der LGBT-Flüchtlingshilfe
Nachdem wir die LGBT-Flüchtlinge aus den Erstaufnahmeeinrichtungen rausgeholt haben werden diese derzeit bei ehrenamtlichen Helfern und privaten Unterstützern untergebracht. Diese Möglichkeiten sind jedoch stark begrenzt und nur für wenige Tage verfügbar. 
Das ist jedoch keine Dauerlösung und reicht nicht aus, um alle LGBT-Flüchtlinge, die derzeit in Deutschland ankommen und noch zu uns kommen werden, dauerhaft sicher außerhalb der Erstaufnahmeeinrichtungen unterzubringen. Behördengänge, Sprach- und Integrationskurse erfolgen oftmals auf ehrenamtlicher Basis und sind nicht ausreichend. Gemeinsam mit eurer Unterstützung werden wir  unser Programm ausweiten.
In Berlin haben LGBT-Flüchtlinge tagsüber die Möglichkeit in der Tagesstätte des Schwulenberatungszentrum Zeit zu verbringen, müssen jedoch Abends wieder zurück in die Erstaufnahmeeinrichtungen.
7. Wofür wird eure Unterstützung verwendet?
Derzeit gibt es diese ganze Unterstützung bereits auf freiwilliger Basis, aber diese reicht nicht aus. Viele Freiwillige können nicht wochenlang umsonst arbeiten, da sie selbst von etwas leben müssen. Auch Wohnungen werden von uns freiwillig gestellt, meist für ein bis zwei Wochen. Das reicht leider nicht aus, um den LGBT-Flüchtlingen eine dauerhafte und sichere Wohnlösung zu bieten.
Eure Unterstützung kommt zielgerichtet an:
Anlaufstellen
Derzeit koordinieren wir bundesweit Anlaufstellen für LGBT-Flüchtlinge. Dadurch können Mitarbeiter von Erstaufnahmeeinrichtungen direkt an uns wenden.
Sicherer Wohnraum und Schutz vor LGBT feindlichen Flüchtlingen
Um die LGBT-Flüchtlinge aus den Erstaufnahmeeinrichtungen rauszuholen, müssen wir als alternative Lösung Wohnungen anmieten, Heizkosten bezahlen und etwas Einrichtung bereitstellen. Allerdings sind unsere finanziellen Mittel im Moment stark begrenzt. 
Psychologische Betreuung
Teilweise begegnen uns die LGBT-Flüchtlinge mit einem schweren Trauma. Mit eurer Unterstützung bezahlen wir dringend notwendige psychologischer Unterstützung. Nur durch professionelle, psychologische Betreuung kann das Erlebte aufgearbeitet werden.
Dolmetscher & Behördengänge
Die LGBT-Flüchtlinge sprechen oft schlechtes Englisch oder können sich nur in Ihrer Landessprache verständigen. Wir werden Dolmetscher engagieren um Behördengänge möglich zu machen.
Einfach mal einen schönen Tag erleben
Mit eurer Hilfe würde ich gerne ein Lächeln verschenken. Ein Lächeln nach einem schönen Tag.
Wenn ich ehrlich bin würde ich den Jungs und Mädels, die zu uns kommen und so viel Schlimmes erlebt haben einfach mal einen schönen Tag ermöglichen. Einen Tag im Zoo oder Kino. In der Hoffnung, dass sie auf andere Gedanken kommen können und nicht ganz so alleine sind.
Sprach- und Integrationskurse
Die staatlichen Sprach- und Integrationskurse sind überfüllt und man wartet Monate auf eine Zuteilung. Mit eurer Unterstützung beschleunigen wir die Integration und versuchen eigene Sprach- und Integrationskurse in Zusammenarbeit mit dem Schwulenberatungszentrum Berlin und dem CSD Dresden zu organisieren.
LGBT-Flüchtlingsheim
Mein bzw. unser größter Wunsch wäre es von eurer Unterstützung ein Heim für mehrere LGBT-Flüchtlinge dauerhaft anmieten zu können und den deutschen Staat damit unter Druck zu setzen. Dieser muss endlich handeln und LGBT-Flüchtlinge als besonders schützenswerte Flüchtlinge anerkennen.
8. Was uns antreibt 
Jeder von uns LGBT´s ist in seinem Leben bereits ein- oder mehrmals ausgegrenzt oder Opfer von Gewalttaten geworden. Oftmals nur, weil wir so sind wie wir sind. Ein nicht sehr schönes Gefühl. 
-> Stellt euch vor, Ihr würdet in einem Land leben, in dem Ihr verfolgt, öffentlich schikaniert und für eure Persönlichkeit gesteinigt und ermordet werdet. Und dann kann es nicht sein, dass Regenbogen Flüchtlinge zu uns kommen, in der Hoffnung in einem liberalen Land wie Deutschland Schutz und Freiheit zu finden und hier in den Erstaufnahmeeinrichtungen exakt das Gleiche erleben müssen wie in ihrer Heimat. Das darf in unserem Land keinem LGBT-Flüchtling wiederfahren!
Wir können alle mit den LGBT-Flüchtlingen mitfühlen. Wenn wir uns in deren Lage versetzen wären wir dankbar, wenn wir von Gleichgesinnten aufgefangen und unterstützt werden. Und uns diese Gleichgesinnten auch bei Integration und Behördengängen helfen.
LGBT-Flüchtlinge kommen mit nichts nach Deutschland. Sie kehren ihrem alten Leben den Rücken. Sie kommen zu uns, weil Sie frei sein wollen. Hier dürfen Sie sein, wie sie sind.
Wieso ich mich an euch wende? Weil ich in der Hoffnung bin das wir, alle LGBT´s in der Welt, zusammenhalten und gemeinsam etwas erreichen können und ein Statement setzen.
Jeder Beitrag zählt. 
Falls ihr uns zu dem Thema bekannter machen könnt ist dies auch ein großer Beitrag für uns um auf unser aktuelles Thema aufmerksam zu machen.

Danke :)

Rainbow Refugees is helping LGBT refugees arriving in Germany to start a new life.



Who is Rainbow Refugees? 
Rainbow
Refugees is a coalition of multiple LGBTi organizations and associations in
Germany. Together, we are working on the federal level to ensure special
protections for gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) refugees, and
are offering support to LGBT refugees arriving in Germany:CSD-Dresden  (Christopher Street Day Organization Dresden Saxony Germany)The CSD-Dresden organize not only the Christopher Street Parade, they  help LGBT refugees in Saxony currently for their accommodation.

Berlin (Gay
Advisory Center Berlin)
Rainbow Refugees KarlsruhePrefaceWhat has happened up to now with LGBT refugees arriving in Germany? This is where my sympathy ends!I would like to make an initial remark that I do not intend to condemn our government as discriminatory here. I am of the opinion that there are a large number of issues that can’t be dealt with currently due to the large number of refugees involved. We lack personnel, often resulting in chaotic situations.Every refugee, no matter whether they are heterosexual, gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, married, a parent, or single, is currently being distributed across Germany to refugee reception centers where they are housed. All incoming refugees have to wait in these centers until the state has accepted their registration. Due to the high number of incoming refugees at the present, this can often take months. Making a decision on an asylum application can also take many additional months.All refugees fleeing due to war and persecution receive a residency permit.Refugee reception centers are repurposed dormitories, tent cities outdoors, or existing buildings (repurposed gymnasiums or barracks).All refugees, including LGBT refugees, are housed in these facilities. There is no private sphere: up to 10 people stay in narrow rooms filled with bunk beds. Hundreds of refugees have to live in gymnasiums, where they spend the night without walls to separate or protect them.Handicapped refugees, refugee women traveling alone, and refugee mothers with children are granted special protections in our country. They are housed in separate hotels or in facilities that provide additional protection and supervision.LGBT refugees are not recognized as deserving of special protection. We often hear that gay, lesbian, and bisexual refugees feel they have to hide their sexuality. Since this is one of the reasons they become refugees in the first place, we at the Rainbow Refugees organization feel this is a major problem.  LGBT refugees often live together in refugee housing facilities with exactly the people they are attempting to flee. These are their countrymen, who might despise LGBT people and even become violent against LGBT refugees.This is where my sympathy ends!It can’t be true that LGBT refugees flee to our country, only to spend at least six months – usually longer than a year – in a reception center where they might be spit on, beaten, hit with stones, and ostracized by their countrymen. I cannot accept this situation in our country. If our government won’t take up this topic, then I at least will work alongside the Schwulenberatungszentrum Berlin, the LSVD, and the CSD in Dresden to help the people who need it most.CSD Dresden is currently providing help and counseling to 30 LGBT refugees. Another 4 LGBT refugees will be added to this group shortly. The Schwulenberatung Berlin is currently providing help and counseling to 70 refugees. But there are still many more people we won’t be able to help without your support.With your support and your engagement, we will get LGBT refugees out of refugee reception centers and provide them safe housing.Facts1. LGBT refugees 
According
to surveys, at least one percent of all people are lesbian, gay, bisexual, or
transgender. Estimates can even reach as high as five to ten percent. Of the
1,000,000 refugees coming to Germany within 2015, this means that at least
10,000 individuals belong to this group. Due to the extremely severe level of
life-threatening danger LGBT refugees face in radicalized ISIS-held areas and
in Iran, the actual number of individuals seeking protection is likely higher.
2. What are they fleeing from?

In war-torn
areas occupied by IS, gays, lesbians, bisexuals, and transgender individuals
are exposed to the death penalty through stoning or summary execution. The fear
of persecution and death, sometimes at the hands of a person’s own family, is
so acute that the only path remaining to them is to escape. They are often
fleeing persecution, war, discrimination, or a society that doesn’t accept the
LGBT “lifestyle.”
3. Where do LGBT refugees come from?

Some
LGBT refugees come from war-torn areas such as Syria, Libya, Afghanistan,
Pakistan, and Ukraine. But some come from other areas in which those with LGBT
sexual orientations and gender expressions are punished, such as Russia.
4. Why are they fleeing to Germany? 
Germany is a liberal country. Our society accepts and tolerates LGBT people. We
celebrate Christopher Street Day in Germany every year in cities across the
country, a festival even visited by families with children. Many of our
country’s most beloved comedians, TV personalities, and stars are gay, lesbian,
bisexual, or transgender, and live in a very open manner. Not even politicians
need to hide their identities today.
5. 
How do LGBT refugees reach our
country?
LGBT
refugees usually come to the EU after a dangerous journey across the
Mediterranean Ocean. They make their continued journey to Germany on foot. All
they possess is their clothing, documents and identification, and a cell phone.
6. Current status of LGBT refugee relief

After
we’ve removed LGBT refugees from reception centers, they will be housed
initially with volunteer helpers and private supporters. These accommodations
are, however, very limited and only available for a few days.
This
is not a long-term solution, and will not be sufficient to house all LGBT
refugees currently arriving in Germany, nor those who will arrive in the future
safely outside of refugee reception centers. Access to authorities and language
and integration courses are often provided on a volunteer basis, and are not
sufficient. With your support, we will expand our program together.
In
Berlin, LGBT refugees have the opportunity to spend time in the daytime
facility in the Schwulenberatungszentrum during the day. In the
evenings, however, they have to return to the refugee reception centers.

7. What do we accomplish with your support?

Currently, all support we receive is on an volunteer basis. This is not enough.



Many volunteers can´t work for weeks on end without pay, since they need to hold careers to support themselves. We are also providing housing on a volunteer basis, typically for one to two weeks. Unfortunately, this is not sufficient to be able to offer LGBT refugees on a long-term and secure housing solution.
Your support will be used to target the following areas:
Contact
points
We
are currently coordinating contact points nationwide for LGBT refugees.
Employees in refugee reception centers can reach us directly through these.
Secure
housing and protection from anti-LGBT refugees
To
get LGBT refugees out of refugee reception centers, we have to rent apartments
as an alternative solution, paying heating costs and providing some
furnishings. Our financial means to do so, however, are severely limited at the
moment.
Psychological
counseling
LGBT
refugees sometimes come to us having suffered severe trauma. With your support,
we will be able to pay for urgently needed psychological support. The only way
for them to work through what they have experienced is with professional
psychological counseling.
Interpreters
& access to authorities

LGBT
refugees often speak poor English or can only understand their native
languages. We will hire interpreters in order to allow them to visit
authorities as needed.
Simply
enjoying a nice day

With
your help, I would love to give someone a smile. A smile after a nice, normal
day.
To
be honest, I would like to make it possible for the boys and girls who come to
us having suffered so much to simply have a nice day. A day at the zoo or the
movies, in the hopes that this will help them change their thinking and not
feel so alone.

Language
and integration courses

State-run
language and integration courses are overcrowded, and refugees can wait months
for a slot. With your support, we can speed up integration and attempt to
organize some language and integration courses in collaboration with the Schwulenberatungszentrum
Berlin and CSD Dresden.

LGBT
refugee house

My,
and our, greatest wish would be to use your support to rent a home for multiple
LGBT refugees in the long term, placing some pressure on the German government.
This would force it to act, finally, to recognize LGBT refugees as a group
deserving of special protection.
8. What drives us to do what we do
Every
LGBT person has been ostracized at some point in their lives, and may have even
been the victim of a violent act. Often just for being who we are. It’s not
exactly a good feeling.
->
Imagine you lived in a country where you were persecuted, publicly humiliated, and
stoned and murdered because of who you are as a person. It shouldn’t be that
rainbow refugees come to us in the hopes that they will find protection and
freedom in a liberal country like Germany, only to have to experience exactly
the same things in the refugee reception center that they did in their

are.
Why
am I turning to you? Because I hope that we, all LGBT individuals in the world,
can join to achieve something together and to make a statement.

<h3><strong>January 28, 2015 UPDATE: </strong></h3>
<h2><strong>Marissa Alexander Released from Prison;</strong></h2>
<h2><strong>Supporters Celebrate, Demand FULL FREEDOM!</strong></h2>
<p>Supporters of Marissa Alexander in Jacksonville, across the US, and all around the world are overjoyed that she <a href=""http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/marissa-alexander-may-be-released"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">has been released</a> from jail after serving 3 years behind bars for defending her life.  In 2010, Marissa Alexander, a black mother of three from Jacksonville, Florida, was forced to defend her life from a life-threatening attack by her estranged husband by firing a single warning shot that caused no injuries.  State Prosecutor Angela Corey prosecuted Marissa, pursuing a 60 year mandatory minimum sentence.  On November 24, 2014, Marissa accepted a plea deal that included time served of nearly 3 years in prison, 65 additional days in the Duval County jail, and 2 years of probation while under home detention.  January 27, 2015 marked the end of her time behind bars.<br/><br/>We are thrilled that Marissa will finally be reunited with her children, her family, and her community. Today’s hearing revealed that Marissa intends to attend school to become a paralegal and she is a wonderful mother to her children who urgently need her.  Amazingly, the State continued their campaign of punishment by trying to add two more years of probation on top of the two years of house detention included in the plea. Fortunately, they failed. Marissa and her family will need time to begin recovering from this arduous and traumatic experience. It’s been a long and painful journey and, though her release from jail is definitely a win -- no 60 years -- the journey of seeking ultimate freedom is not over.  Marissa will be forced to be on strict home detention while being under surveillance for two years.  This is by no means freedom in the sense we feel she deserves.  Our next agenda is to seek full restoration for Marissa and her family, including the expunging of her so-called criminal record, and a systemic transformation that prevents black women and all survivors of domestic violence from experiencing the hostile and brutal treatment from policing, prosecution, and prison systems that Marissa has endured. We will push for improved legislation and monitoring of systems that penalize victims of domestic violence who choose to save their lives by force. This is by no means a conclusion.  FMN's full press release is <strong><a href=""http://www.freemarissanow.org/marissa-alexander-released-from-prison-supporters-celebrate-demand-full-freedom.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a></strong>, and we also recommend <strong><a href=""http://www.usprisonculture.com/blog/2015/01/28/marissa-alexander-did-not-die/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">this reflection</a> </strong>by Mariame Kaba, member of Chicago Alliance to Free Marissa Alexander.</p>
<p>We are filled with gratitude for the hundreds of people who have donated and organized fundraisers all around the world.  <strong>We want to be very clear: The reason Marissa is finally out of prison for good is directly because of your political and financial support.  </strong>Your donations were CRUCIAL in supporting her pro bono legal team to offer exceptional legal advocacy and your activism ensured that her case stayed in the public eye, which pressured Florida's politicians to pay attention.  Every one of us has a hand in this victory!  Thank you, thank you, thank you.</p>
<p>We're going to take a short break, but we'll be back with more specific thank you's and shout outs soon (there are so many!).  In the meantime, feel free to continue to donate to the <a href=""http://gogetfunding.com/project/marissa-alexander-freedom-fundraiser"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">CURRENT FUND</a> and help Marissa Alexander cover the very expensive process of rebuilding her life.</p>

<p><b>---</b></p>
<p>Marissa Alexander is an African American mother of three and survivor of domestic violence from Jacksonville, FL.  In 2010, she fired a warning shot upwards into a wall to defend herself from a life-threatening beating from her estranged husband. Despite the fact that Marissa caused no injuries and has no previous criminal record, and despite the fact that Florida’s self-defense law includes the right to “Stand Your Ground,” she was subsequently arrested, prosecuted, and sentenced to 20 years in prison.  She won an appeal, but was then re-prosecuted and threatened with a 60 year sentence.  She accepted a plea deal in November 2014 that included almost 3 years of time served in prison, 65 additional days in Duval County Jail, and 2 years of house detention while wearing and paying for an ankle surveillance monitor.  On January 27, 2015, Marissa was finally released from jail and reunited with her family.  Free Marissa Now continues to demand her full freedom.</p>
<p><b>FULL ACQUITTAL: A Movement Behind The Trial</b></p>
<p>Free Marissa Now, an alliance of organizers and thousands of people all around the world, have been organizing for Marissa's freedom from prison and intend to keep going until she is free.  Because State Attorney Angela Corey refuses to drop the case against Marissa Alexander, continuing a pattern of unjust targeting and prosecution, our movement turns to supporting Marissa, her family, and her legal team in winning her full freedom.</p>
<p><b>WHERE DOES THE MONEY GO?</b></p>
<p>This fundraiser is accountable to Marissa Alexander and her family.  All proceeds from this fundraiser go to the Marissa Alexander Legal Defense Fund which is administered by Marissa's family on her behalf. You can find the link to this fundraiser on the family's website:<a href=""http://justiceformarissa.blogspot.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://justiceformarissa.blogspot.com/</a>.</p>

<p>Marissa's supporters are the greatest!  Every step of the way, you have shown up and given deep support and love.  Your donation is just one more way that you give life to the movement to free Marissa and highlight the need to support all survivors who have been criminalized while trying to navigate the conditions of violence.  Thank you so much for your donation!</p>

Marissa and her family will need time to begin recovering from this arduous and traumatic experience. It’s been a long and painful journey and, though her release from jail is definitely a win -- no 60 years -- the journey of seeking ultimate freedom is not over.  Marissa will be forced to be on strict home detention while being under surveillance for two years.  This is by no means freedom in the sense we feel she deserves.  Our next agenda is to seek full restoration for Marissa and her family, including the expunging of her so-called criminal record, and a systemic transformation that prevents black women and all survivors of domestic violence from experiencing the hostile and brutal treatment from policing, prosecution, and prison systems that Marissa has endured. We will push for improved legislation and monitoring of systems that penalize victims of domestic violence who choose to save their lives by force. This is by no means a conclusion.  FMN's full press release is here, and we also recommend this reflection by Mariame Kaba, member of Chicago Alliance to Free Marissa Alexander.
We are filled with gratitude for the hundreds of people who have donated and organized fundraisers all around the world.  We want to be very clear: The reason Marissa is finally out of prison for good is directly because of your political and financial support.  Your donations were CRUCIAL in supporting her pro bono legal team to offer exceptional legal advocacy and your activism ensured that her case stayed in the public eye, which pressured Florida's politicians to pay attention.  Every one of us has a hand in this victory!  Thank you, thank you, thank you.
We're going to take a short break, but we'll be back with more specific thank you's and shout outs soon (there are so many!).  In the meantime, feel free to continue to donate to the CURRENT FUND and help Marissa Alexander cover the very expensive process of rebuilding her life.

---
Marissa Alexander is an African American mother of three and survivor of domestic violence from Jacksonville, FL.  In 2010, she fired a warning shot upwards into a wall to defend herself from a life-threatening beating from her estranged husband. Despite the fact that Marissa caused no injuries and has no previous criminal record, and despite the fact that Florida’s self-defense law includes the right to “Stand Your Ground,” she was subsequently arrested, prosecuted, and sentenced to 20 years in prison.  She won an appeal, but was then re-prosecuted and threatened with a 60 year sentence.  She accepted a plea deal in November 2014 that included almost 3 years of time served in prison, 65 additional days in Duval County Jail, and 2 years of house detention while wearing and paying for an ankle surveillance monitor.  On January 27, 2015, Marissa was finally released from jail and reunited with her family.  Free Marissa Now continues to demand her full freedom.
FULL ACQUITTAL: A Movement Behind The Trial
Free Marissa Now, an alliance of organizers and thousands of people all around the world, have been organizing for Marissa's freedom from prison and intend to keep going until she is free.  Because State Attorney Angela Corey refuses to drop the case against Marissa Alexander, continuing a pattern of unjust targeting and prosecution, our movement turns to supporting Marissa, her family, and her legal team in winning her full freedom.
WHERE DOES THE MONEY GO?
This fundraiser is accountable to Marissa Alexander and her family.  All proceeds from this fundraiser go to the Marissa Alexander Legal Defense Fund which is administered by Marissa's family on her behalf. You can find the link to this fundraiser on the family's website:http://justiceformarissa.blogspot.com/.
Contact us at freemarissanow@gmail.com if you have questions.
THANK YOU!
Marissa's supporters are the greatest!  Every step of the way, you have shown up and given deep support and love.  Your donation is just one more way that you give life to the movement to free Marissa and highlight the need to support all survivors who have been criminalized while trying to navigate the conditions of violence.  Thank you so much for your donation!

<h3>Why A Wall?</h3>
<p>      Students for Justice in Palestine - UIUC focuses on raising awareness on campus about the daily struggles Palestinians face.  While reasoned arguments, statistics, news reports, etc. provide a mountain of support for our cause, they can be confusing, intimidating, and frankly uninteresting to the average student.  The experience of Palestinian daily life is the most powerful tool of them all.  </p>
<p>     That's where the wall comes in.  SJP wants to bring a small taste of life under occupation to students at the U of I. The wall will serve as a stage on which we will set the scene of oppression and invite our audience to immerse themselves in the experience.  Students will be able to see its winding route, sense the imposing eyes of the watchtowers, and stand next to this immense structure and feel the inhumanity of it all.</p>
<p>      In addition to seeing the physical structure, SJP will use the wall as a forum to present those arguments, statistics, and reports I mentioned above.  <img alt=""Example of a wall at UCLA"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://fbcdn-sphotos-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-snc7/s720x720/420653_10101175716601326_2511457_66012902_958300162_n.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>    As you can see from this image of a similar wall at UCLA, it is much more than a flat, gray structure.  </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Our Needs</h3>
<p>     As you can imagine, this venture will be quite expensive.  We are attempting to raise approximately $1,000.  That amount will allow us to build the full wall to fit the display area.  Most of the funds will go directly towards materials: 4x8 boards and supports.  We will also need some funds to go towards pictures and graphics and supplies to put on the face of the wall.  </p>
<p>Our minimum is $500.  Without the full amount, we will have to scale down the size, leaving empty space in places, but still covering the basic plan.  The design is segmental, so we can tailor the size specifically to our funds.</p>
<p>Our needs aren't too great, so with a fair number of supporters, we should have no problem reaching our goals!  Every little bit helps, so please consider donating!  (And don't forget to forward this to your friends!)</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The <strong>Legal Aid Service of Háttér Society (Hungary)</strong> has been providing free legal help and representation for LGBTQI victims of violence, harassment and discrimination for 17 years.</p>
<p><strong>Our clients received death threats, were attacked in shops and while cycling. Some were beaten by neonazis while on their way to the Budapest Pride march </strong>– and have reported these hate crimes with our assistance. However, as research shows, less than one fifth of victims report hate crimes. Many of those who do not report these crimes are afraid of homophobic or transphobic reactions from the police. We have to change this. </p>
<p><u><a href=""https://uni-form.eu"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>UNI-FORM is an online tool and app</strong></a> connecting Háttér and the police to work together to reduce this lack of reporting. Help us make it work!</u></p>
<p><strong>With your help we can promote this easy-to-use application in the LGBTQI community, and provide more trainings for the police on LGBTQI victims of hate crimes. </strong></p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
The Legal Aid Service of Háttér Society (Hungary) has been providing free legal help and representation for LGBTQI victims of violence, harassment and discrimination for 17 years.
Our clients received death threats, were attacked in shops and while cycling. Some were beaten by neonazis while on their way to the Budapest Pride march – and have reported these hate crimes with our assistance. However, as research shows, less than one fifth of victims report hate crimes. Many of those who do not report these crimes are afraid of homophobic or transphobic reactions from the police. We have to change this. 
UNI-FORM is an online tool and app connecting Háttér and the police to work together to reduce this lack of reporting. Help us make it work!
With your help we can promote this easy-to-use application in the LGBTQI community, and provide more trainings for the police on LGBTQI victims of hate crimes. 
What We Need 

We need 8,500 USD to advertise the online tool and application for reporting hate crimes – the first such tool that connects Háttér and the police and furthers our working together to reduce latency. (Users can decide whether they want to send their reports to Háttér only or both Háttér and the police. The latter option creates a unique opportunity for us to follow up on cases and ensure they are categorized and treated properly by the police.)
With your help, we can also make training materials and hold trainings to educate the police about hate crimes committed against LGBTQI people.  
If we do not reach our entire goal, we will use every dollar raised on promoting the online tool and application so that LGBTQI victims of hate crimes know about it, use it, and thus help reduce the lack of reporting of hate crimes and improve police awareness.
Your help 

will promote awareness of LGBTQI people in Hungary of hate crimes, so that they know they are not alone and that they have the right to seek help from the police and victim support services. We'll work to increase the reporting of hate crimes and improve the competency of the police to work with victims.
Our work 
We provide free legal help and representation for LGBTQI victims of violence, harassment and discrimination. Some of our cases in 2017:

<h3>What is this About?  This About Confronting the Prevelance of Racism and Criminality Within the Judiciary Through Grassroots Organizing and Action. </h3>
<p>  Just recently, community people in Washington, D.C. came together to form the Peoples' Defense Network to fashion action to address the wide-spread racism, corruption, and abuse within the local judiciary, they formed the <strong>Peoples' Defense Network</strong>. The ""War on Drugs"" has been openly nothing more than a war on black people, add to this that ""law enforcement"" has always been used as an excuse for racial oppression. The judiciary across this country is rife with racism, corruption, and abuse.</p>
<p>  Because DC is a colony, the judges are imposed on us, as is a U.S. Attorney as the local prosecutor. These people have no real relationship with the communities of DC, particularly not the black and impoverished ones. They have no regard for the rights of black and impoverished residents. Judges of the D.C. ""Superior"" court routinely allow and support police and the U.S. Attorney instigating malicious prosecutions. This is criminal, but many of the judges of that court are actively engaged in this conduct as a matter of practice. Far too many of the judges do not know the law because they do believe that they have to account under the law.</p>
<p>  The immedaite task of <strong>Peoples' Defense Network</strong> is to take on the local judiciary, to mobilize and organize to expose it, and to force it to reform and make concessions. Community people will be educated in the basics of law and will then begin to monitor the conduct of judges in the ""Superior"" court. Bad judges will be identified by having people fill out an intake form. From this we develop a data base, which we will publish over the web, identifying the worst offenders.  By way of an intake form, the PDN will identify practices and show patterns of lawlessness. </p>
<p>   The PDN will then press the Commission on Judicial Disability and Tenure to investigate complaints and take demanded action against lawless judges. Currently, the Commission does not conduct investigations, but rather works exclusively to conceal lawlessness with the DC judiciary. The Commission answers to the DC City Council Committee on the Judiciary, and it is by way of also putting pressure on councilmembers under threat of defeating them in the next election, that we also bring pressure to bear on the Commission. In holding the Commission to task with increased public scrutiny, we bring pressure to bear on the judges, meaning a drastic reduction in the number of malicious prosecutions, wrongful imprisonment. </p>

Numbers increased dramatically in October 2015 and thousands of migrants now arrive daily on the shores of the Greek island. Aid organisations and the Greek government are struggling to handle the influx of migrants, and as a result, living conditions are deteriorating and there is not enough medical care to go around.<p></p> </div><div>
<strong>Volunteers from all over are coming to Lesvos to help. I will be joining them to provide as much assistance and support as I can.</strong><br/>
</div><div>
<p></p>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Weak and traumatised from their journey, refugees without adequate support and help are vulnerable to harassment, exploitation and abuse. Help me fund life-saving supplies and equipment desperately needed by these refugees, especially in the coming winter months. This will include:</span><span style=""background-color: initial;""> </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">blankets, socks, underwear, trousers, hats, gloves, shoes, sleeping bags, tents, water, oral rehydration salts and food. </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">My personal expenses such as cost of flight, transportation, accommodation and food will be self funded.</span><br/>

For years, refugees from war torn countries have been fleeing persecution and violence hoping to seek safe refuge in Europe, risking everything on perilous journeys across the Mediterranean to reach the shores of Lesvos in Greece. Numbers increased dramatically in October 2015 and thousands of migrants now arrive daily on the shores of the Greek island. Aid organisations and the Greek government are struggling to handle the influx of migrants, and as a result, living conditions are deteriorating and there is not enough medical care to go around. 
Volunteers from all over are coming to Lesvos to help. I will be joining them to provide as much assistance and support as I can.


Weak and traumatised from their journey, refugees without adequate support and help are vulnerable to harassment, exploitation and abuse. Help me fund life-saving supplies and equipment desperately needed by these refugees, especially in the coming winter months. This will include: blankets, socks, underwear, trousers, hats, gloves, shoes, sleeping bags, tents, water, oral rehydration salts and food. My personal expenses such as cost of flight, transportation, accommodation and food will be self funded.


100% of your donations will go directly to the refugees.

    
All supplies will also be bought locally in Greece to support the local economy. This is a crucial principle of humanitarian work and it ensures that the local economy is supported as much as the refugees are. 


I will personally update you on how the money has been used on a daily basis and how it directly benefits the refugees. Follow me on @tBlinkteam on Twitter or @theBlinkTeam on Instagram for updates! The work that I will be involved in includes:

distributing aid, clothes and food
unpacking boxes of donations and sorting goods
driving donated goods to other places on the island
cleaning up beaches and roads
cleaning up around camp and bus areas
picking up refugees who arrive on remote beaches
preparing food for the refugees and other volunteers

Anyone can help, and any help would be truly appreciated.
  
It is people like you who donate, and the volunteers on the ground that make all the difference in the world to the refugees. If you're interested in joining the cause and helping me out, give me a shout!
Thank you for your generosity and support. :)

Many of you know that I have worked as an activist and anthropologist focusing on
Afro-descendant land rights in Nicaragua for the last fifteen years.  My central engagement has been with a rural
fishing and farming community called Monkey Point.  My book manuscript follows this community’s activism
for autonomous territorial rights.  After
a decade of mobilization, Monkey Point won a title to a large multiethnic
territory in 2009 that they share with other Afro-descendant Creole and
indigenous Rama communities in the region.
Although
this title is inalienable and non-transferable, the central government has
recently passed Law 840 (Special Law for the Development of Nicaraguan Infrastructure
and Transport related to the Canal, Free Trade Zones, and Associated
Infrastructure) granting a 50-year renewable concession to a Chinese venture
capitalist to build, own, and operate a series of infrastructure mega-projects
on indigenous and Afro-descendant lands. 
The projects are diverse and include an interoceanic canal three times
the length of the Panama Canal, an industrial port, a petroleum pipeline, an
interoceanic railway, an international airport, and a free trade zone.  The Nicaraguan National Assembly passed the
law with no consultation or dialogue with civil society or the affected
communities, violating indigenous and Afro-descendant statutory rights to
self-determination, communal property, and natural resources.  Needless to say, if the projects move forward,
they will be environmentally catastrophic, threatening the livelihoods and
future existence of the communities directly affected.
The
territorial authorities for the communities have responded by submitting a
legal appeal to the Supreme Court of Nicaragua. 
In the event that the Nicaraguan legal system fails to adequately
address their concerns, they are preparing to take the case to the
Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR).  This modest fund will allow Monkey Point to
pay legal fees to their long-time legal representative, Dr. Maria Luisa Acosta,
and introduce their case to IACHR.  While
it is hard to know if the mega-projects will move forward or not, past
experience has proven that indigenous and Afro-descendant communities in
Nicaragua are far more likely to have their rights respected at the national
level when they pursue international legal remedies.
I
will administrate the fund, which will be used solely for the payment of legal
fees to initiate the complaint in the IACHR.  For those of you who don't know me, I earned my PhD in cultural anthropology from the University of Texas at Austin and am currently an Assistant Professor of Comparative Cultures and Politics at Michigan State University.  If the case advances through the Inter-American Court system, Monkey
Point and their allies will need to secure long-term financial support from a
counterpart organization.  We have set our fund raising goal low in the hopes that we can met the community's most immediate legal needs in a short time frame.  Any funds raised in excess of our $1000 goal will be used to finance the community's future legal representation.  Donations can
be made anonymously and any amount, no matter how modest, is deeply
appreciated.  If you have any questions please feel free to contact me directly at <mplegalfund@gmail.com>.

inventors, odd fellows. Without these strange people the history of
development would become the history of degradation. For their
protection and for their stimulation people have thought up a system

design of the Linrec-2 fusion reactor was born by a will of

<p>
</p><p>
<b>Huge problem and danger</b> is
that in Ukraine there is the article 37 of the Law of Ukraine ""About
protection of the rights to inventions"" and the article 8 of the
Law ""About the state secret"" which allows to make secret
and to stop any economically important projects. In the case of
filing a patent application in Ukraine the law requires that within
three months the invention must be checked: to see whether it should
be identified as a state secret or not.   Such a decision is
completely in the hands of bureaucrats and depends only on their
personal desire. Considering the level of corruption in Ukraine and
based on preliminary talks with patent agents, the invention of
Linrec-2 would be made secret in Ukraine. And all this in spite
of the fact that all calculations, all creative work was conducted
without participation of the state, at the author’s expense and in
his personal time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
It means to mankind that the
invention which can completely change energetics will fall into the hands of economically backward corrupted state officials
violating human rights. Whether in this case it will become available

<p>Since 2010, Rotary clubs in Oregon have partnered with a non-governmental organization called Anthill Foundation to provide health projects in villages without doctors.  They have helped build a clinic, and have done many projects to improve the quality and accessibility of water, particularly in the rural Tororo district.  Since then, a strong partnership was formed and medical teams from United States go to Uganda annually to volunteer their expertise within these communities.  In June, I will be arriving as the first individual to support the newly registered Rural Health Team Uganda Organization.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Need</h3>
<p>There is so much need in the rural village of Tororo. I am raising funds to buy medication and medical supplies in Uganda to support this rural health clinic while contributing to the local economy.    </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As a public health nurse, my expertise is in health promotion, disease prevention and health education.  I will be supporting the local clinicians in providing health care to their community.  The villages served by the Rural Health Team Uganda have very little access to medicine and medical resources.  Your donation will enable me to buy needed medication that will help save lives and medical supplies that will help maintain the rural health clinic.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Lift Ugandans up with positive thoughts and loving prayers.  Ugandans are strong, smart, and capable!  Uganda is a culture where human interaction and a simple greeting is more important than an agenda.  Please spread the word and lift these clinicians up with your positive thoughts and loving prayers.  </p>

An Icelandic feminist activist. I've been promoting women's rights like crazy online and in the media for the past couple of years and throughout that time I think it's safe to say I've been the most outspoken and most talked about feminist activist in Iceland. I've received honors from the Icelandic offices of UN Women as well as from Stígamót, the leading Icelandic counseling and information center for survivors of sexual abuse and violence. In 2012 I was voted Hero of the Year by the readers of Icelandic newspaper DV.</p><p>In June 2014 a huge Nordic Women's Rights conference will be held in Malmö, Sweden. More on that <a href=""http://nf2014.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>. I really really want to go. I have to go. Seriously. I'm going to need a bit of extra cash to make this happen, at least somewhere in the surroundings of 7-800 EUR. The total cost of the trip should be around <i>double that amount</i>, but I'm looking into different ways to fund the trip. </p><h3>

Þá mættu þúsund konur frá Íslandi, merkileg tengslamyndun og merkileg menntun átti sér stað. Svona samkomur geta breytt landslaginu.

So the text below is in Icelandic. But don't hesitate to look me up on Facebook or Twitter if you want to talk! Also, my gmail is hildur.lilliendahl. In case someone foreign and Hildur-curious should stumble upon this, I'll post some links to news about me in English below all that Icelandic bullcrap.Just to explain a tiny bit in English: I am Hildur Lilliendahl Viggósdóttir. An Icelandic feminist activist. I've been promoting women's rights like crazy online and in the media for the past couple of years and throughout that time I think it's safe to say I've been the most outspoken and most talked about feminist activist in Iceland. I've received honors from the Icelandic offices of UN Women as well as from Stígamót, the leading Icelandic counseling and information center for survivors of sexual abuse and violence. In 2012 I was voted Hero of the Year by the readers of Icelandic newspaper DV.In June 2014 a huge Nordic Women's Rights conference will be held in Malmö, Sweden. More on that here. I really really want to go. I have to go. Seriously. I'm going to need a bit of extra cash to make this happen, at least somewhere in the surroundings of 7-800 EUR. The total cost of the trip should be around double that amount, but I'm looking into different ways to fund the trip. 
Það helsta
Ég er Hildur, femínískur aktívisti sem heldur úti bloggsíðunni Karlar sem hata konur. Á undanförnum tveimur árum hefur mér tekist, allt að því óvart, að taka talsvert mikið pláss í opinberri umræðu um jafnrétti kynjanna, ágalla á því og leiðir til að ná því. Ég hef ekki aðgang að neinum drjúgum sjóðum, hef engin fjárhagslega sjálfstæð samtök á bakvið mig og hef háð mína baráttu þessi tvö ár í sjálfboðavinnu.Ég þrái að komast á Nordiskt Forum í Malmö í sumar. Nordiskt Forum er sameiginleg risastór ráðstefna kvennahreyfinga Norðurlandanna. Hún var síðast haldin í Turku 1994 og þar á undan í Osló 1988. Þá mættu þúsund konur frá Íslandi, merkileg tengslamyndun og merkileg menntun átti sér stað. Svona samkomur geta breytt landslaginu. Mig langar að taka þátt í því og ég bið um þína aðstoð til að svo megi verða. Miðaverð á ráðstefnuna hækkar eftir 21. mars. Ég stefni að því að vera búin að tryggja mér miða fyrir þann tíma. Hvað mig vantar og hvað þú færðEf þú styrkir mig til þátttöku í Nordiskt Forum færðu að sjálfsögðu kveðju tilbaka frá mér. Eðli þeirra kveðja fer eftir upphæð styrksins. Þú getur fengið mention og koss á Facebook, þú getur fengið póstkort frá Malmö, þú gætir fengið sérvalda gjöf frá Malmö og ef þú ert í fáránlega gjafmildu skapi færðu mig sjálfa heim til þín (mögulega ásamt vel völdum aðstoðarmanni) að laga kaffi og baka brauð.Heildarkostnaður þessa ferðalags verður aldrei langt undir 200.000 krónum. Flugmiðinn hangir röngumegin við 50K, hótelgisting daðrar við 100K, miðinn á ráðstefnuna kostar um 15K og eitthvað verður kona nú að borða. Ég er að safna pening sjálf og er líka að sanka að mér hugmyndum um mögulegar styrkveitingar. Ég er að gera mér vonir um að fá frábæra stuðningsfólkið mitt til að hjálpa mér með helminginn af kostnaðinum. Ég hef fulla trú á að það muni takast með einum eða öðrum hætti.Stillingin á þessum reikningi er flexible funding, sem þýðir að ég þarf ekki nauðsynlega að ná markmiði mínu til að þeir peningar sem safnast renni til mín. Það er einfaldlega vegna þess að ég hef stuttan tíma til stefnu þar til miðaverðið á ráðstefnuna hækkar en það er ekki endanlegt deadline til að taka ákvörðun um hvort ég fer. Ég mun því halda áfram að safna eins og óð kona að þessum skamma tíma liðnum þrátt fyrir að ég nái ekki markmiðinu í gegnum þessa síðu.ÁhrifinÉg trúi því að barátta mín sé til gagns fyrir íslenskt samfélag. Ég trúi því að það sé gott fyrir íslenskan femínisma (og þar með vitanlega íslenskt samfélag) að ég, sem einhver herskáasti og mest áberandi og umtalaði femímisti landsins, kynni mér strauma og stefnur á öðrum Norðurlöndum, myndi og styrki tengsl og mennti mig í aktívisma. Ef þú trúir því líka óska ég eftir því að þú hjálpir mér að vera memm í Nordiskt Forum. Ef ekki, þá er það vitanlega í fínu lagi og fullt af öðrum sniðugum málum til að leggja lið á internetinu.En hvað ef þú átt ekki pening?Það er sko allt í lagi. En þá langar mig líka að biðja þig að spá í hvort þú þekkir einhvern annan sem gæti viljað hjálpa. Hvað er að frétta af helfemínísku frænku þinni vestur á Hólmavík sem veit eeeekkert hvað hún á að gera við alla peningana sína? Eða langar þig kannski að senda mér bréf?
