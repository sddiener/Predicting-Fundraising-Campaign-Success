<h3>Background:</h3>
<p>The blood brain barrier (BBB) is a highly selective physical and chemical boundary limiting the access of chemicals, molecules, organisms, and drugs to the brain. Although this barrier is vital in protecting us from bacteria and neurotoxins, it poses a serious challenge from a clinical standpoint when it hinders the passage of administered diagnostic markers and pharmaceutical drugs and limits their therapeutic potential. </p>
<p>Clinicians must prescribe much higher doses of a certain drug in order for that drug to cross the BBB and have a therapeutic effect in the brain.  In many circumstances, the higher dose required leads to toxically high levels outside the brain (peripherally) before reaching therapeutic levels inside the brain. Numerous drugs have failed clinical trials or been deemed not suitable for human use because of their inability to cross the BBB and subsequent slow uptake into the central nervous system. Furthermore, many drugs currently on the market cause serious peripheral side-effects because of the high dose required to cross the BBB. If one were able to bypass the BBB and therefore administer a lower dose to achieve the same therapeutic effect, this would significantly reduce peripheral side-effects and widen the gamut of drugs available for use.</p>
<p>Statistically speaking, the BBB blocks 100% of large neurotherapeutics and 98% of small-molecule-drugs. Current methods exist for bypassing the BBB for the purposes of drug delivery, yet they are either ineffective, dangerous, or extremely invasive. We are working to create a platform technology that can be used in collaboration with pharmas and research institutions, which are currently developing effective drugs to be used in treatments of neurological diseases. </p>

there are 44 million suffering with Alzheimer’s and Dementia


Every

By
2050, 14 million Americans will be diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease alone

Effective medicine cannot currently pass through the blood brain
barrier!





Background:
The blood brain barrier (BBB) is a highly selective physical and chemical boundary limiting the access of chemicals, molecules, organisms, and drugs to the brain. Although this barrier is vital in protecting us from bacteria and neurotoxins, it poses a serious challenge from a clinical standpoint when it hinders the passage of administered diagnostic markers and pharmaceutical drugs and limits their therapeutic potential. 
Clinicians must prescribe much higher doses of a certain drug in order for that drug to cross the BBB and have a therapeutic effect in the brain.  In many circumstances, the higher dose required leads to toxically high levels outside the brain (peripherally) before reaching therapeutic levels inside the brain.

We are working to create a platform technology that can be used in collaboration with pharmas and research institutions, which are currently developing effective drugs to be used in treatments of neurological diseases. 


By encapsulating an existing drug which could previously not get across the BBB or could get across but was too toxic we can help solve the issues with high toxicity and non-penetration.

From Mumia's Family and Friends:


""My husband should never have been in prison... He's innocent and he should be free... It came as a shock to Mumia and to us that he had a diabetic condition.""            - Wadiya Jamal (Mumia's wife)

""Prison Officials are lying. Mumia is going through torture at the hands of Department of Corrections through medical neglect. It is clear to people that they want to kill Mumia. They gave him the wrong medication which made his condition worse. Inmates on the inside who questioned what was happening have been subjected to direct retaliation by the superintendent. They have been moving concerned inmates out of Mumia's unit in an effort to both bury and keep this critical information from the public."" - Pam Africa (International Concerned Friends & Family of Mumia Abu-Jamal)


“The rules
that the prisons have are very arcane. They don’t give out any information about
prisoners to their families or anyone else. It’s like you have your hands tied
because you don’t know how the prisoner is and you have no way of talking to
him. I remember a month ago, Phil Africa exercising in the
prison, next thing they know he was in the hospital, they moved him to a
hospital and didn’t tell his family where he was, and three days later he was
dead. It’s scary -- we need to change and we need to discuss and
the prison authorities need to be more humane to the families of prisoners.” - Keith Cook (Mumia's brother)",1.0,1,"5 Campaigns

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>My name is Robert Bob Okello, currently a
second year student from Uganda at UWC Red Cross Nordic – Norway. To me, it is
so far an experience of a kind worth being grateful for. </p>
<p>This year, I have been lucky enough to have
gotten the opportunity to celebrate Christmas home with my family. A big thanks
to the college who made this possible. Unfortunately, as I speak now, my mother
I really sick and needs immediate medical treatment. Abdominal scan results
have shown an enlarged liver and reduced spleen suggestive of <b><i>hepatomegaly</i></b>
and <b><i>hyposplenism</i></b>
according to the local doctors. She is also battling it out with <b><i>hypertension</i></b>
and <b><i>brucellosis</i></b>
though the former seems to be calming down.</p>
<p>However, due to financial challenges at the
moments, a quick medical treatment is being compromised. Doctors warn that
delayed treatment may lead to further health complications which are absolutely
undesirable. It’s indeed a challenging period for me and the entire family but
I know with your support, it’s all going to be well.</p>
<p>Friends, your support shall be utilized in
the following ways. First and foremost, there is need for a medical
re-examination as the one that has been done so seems to be lacking
professional credibility. It’s indeed sad that the personnel seem to be money
driven and not delivering the proper service. A fraction of your support shall
therefore be used to get access to a proper hospital.</p>
<p>Secondly and most importantly, a larger
fraction of your invaluable contribution shall be used to foot the medical bills
and purchase the necessary medicines. We have to move her from a local village
in Northern Uganda possibly to a regional referral hospital where she can get
proper attention from the experienced medical personnel available there as it
is not possible where she is at the moment.</p>
<p>It’s therefore my humble request that you
support me and the rest of my family to assist her regain a better living
condition. A Christmas or New Year’s Day in hospital is way better one in an
excruciating pain somewhere in your bad with sad people around you. Your kind
assistance really means a great deal to the entire family and personally, I
will be forever grateful and thankful</p>
<p>Be blessed this festive season and I wish

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Our story...</h2>
<h3>...from ""<i>station to station</i>""</h3>
<p>As an expert in the study of venoms, lover of Nature and David Bowie fan, when eight years ago a shaggy haired yellow spider was named <i>Heteropoda davidbowie</i>, our boss Reto couldn’t resist working on it. Our scientific team investigated the so-called <i>davidbowie</i> spider venom and discovered numerous bioactive peptides over the years. One of these revealed remarkable potential for anti-ageing treatment. We named it HDB-243 (HDB for <strong><i>H</i></strong><i>eteropoda <strong>D</strong>avid<strong>B</strong>owie</i>) and our project began!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Who is <i>Heteropoda davidbowie</i>, a ""<i>spider from mars</i>""?</h3>
<p>.... and it all started with him. Him? <i>Heteropoda davidbowie</i> of course: the fuzzy blonde Malaysian spider able to create miracles. Let us tell you how.....</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1483713234/arkv4lhz7tbcqgv4796e.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Close-up view of our dear friend <i>Heteropoda davidbowie</i>.</p>
<p><i>Heteropoda davidbowie </i>is a large yellow huntsman spider from Malaysia. It was named in honor of rock star David Bowie in 2008 by its discoverer, German biologist Peter Jäger in order to raise awareness about animal species threatened with extinction. It refers to David Bowie's early 70’s band ""The Spiders From Mars"", songs such as ""Glass Spider"", and the resemblance of the frontal view of the spider to the singer's painted face and orange hairs in his early career.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>From ""<i>ground control to major tom</i>""...</h3>
<p>...we have analyzed the venom in our labs over the past 6 years. This venom is extremely complex, and our work led to the discovery of 136 different bioactive peptides (small proteins). Our original idea was to give each a funny name like <i>stardustine</i>, <i>aladdine</i>, <i>majortomine</i>, <i>lifeonmarsine</i>, <i>spidersfrommarsine</i>, <i>ziggyne</i>, <i>letsdancine</i>, <i>lazarine</i>, and so on. A tribute.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1483713690/stn4fy8vvl8pimpvxreb.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">This mass spectrum of a fraction of the venom of <i>Heteropoda davidbowie</i> reveals its complexity.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<h3>Some of the venom peptides were intriguing, so we decided to… ""<i>move on</i>""!</h3>
<p>We investigated their biological activity in the lab on validated pharmaceutical tests (electrophysiology) and one molecule revealed unexpected surprises. This is ""HDB-243"", the active ingredient of <strong>instant moonlight</strong>: a bioactive peptide, in other words a small protein that has a biological activity.</p>
<div style=""text-align: center;""><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/_iMGc0kVsLg?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;vq=highres""></iframe></div></div>
<p> </p>
<h3>So, how is he going to make us look younger ""<i>the next day""</i>?</h3>
<p>HDB-243, the active ingredient of <strong>instant moonlight</strong> is a bioactive peptide, in other words a small protein that has a biological activity. Our research has demonstrated that it acts on the neuromuscular system. HDB-243 possesses a high potency in blocking a receptor located at the skin surface, which induces instant inhibition of muscle contraction without any need for skin penetration. This relaxes the clenched facial muscles that cause wrinkles and makes skin smoother, for example at crow’s feet around the eyes. <strong>instant moonlight</strong> cream uses a chemically synthesized version of the peptide, which is a perfect copy of the natural HDB-243 isolated from spider venom.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1483714388/urvnl55itdqtmilqtfyd.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">The HDB-242 peptide blocks receptors of the skin surface preventing contraction by a relaxing effect.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">We tested <strong>instant moonlight</strong> on a few volunteers, and were ourselves amazed of the results.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">This was after 15 minutes and there is <strong>no photo editing</strong>!</p>
<p> </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Our Goals</h2>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>So ""<i>where are we now</i>""?</h3>
<p>To make this reality and share our passion, we are launching our crowdfunding project. Using our state of the art methods for analyzing animal venoms, we have already identified the molecule HDB-243, confirmed its biological activity in the lab and validted its efficacy as an instant anti-wrinle cream on a few volunteers.</p>
<p>Our goal is now to achieve clinical studies with a first production and offer you theses exclusive products before they even make it to market.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Join us on our venomous venture and ""<i>let’s dance</i>""!</h3>
<p>Your funding will enable us to advance <strong>instant moonlight</strong> from the discovery stage to production and market (in USD, $*) and offer you exclusive pre-market products:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>$ 5'000.-     Synthesize the HDB-243 peptide</p></li>
<li><p>$ 3’000.-     Formulate an exclusive cream</p></li>
<li><p>$ 6’000.-     Produce the pilot samples, filling &amp; packaging</p></li>
<li><p>$ 2’000.-     Perform expanded toxicity, safety and tolerability testing</p></li>
<li><p>$ 8’000.-     Perform additional efficacy studies in humans</p></li>
<li><p>$ 1’000.-     Logistics</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Total : $ 25'000.-</p>
<p>*1 $) is roughly 1 swiss franc (CHF) or 0.90 euros (EUR, €)</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><i>""Did you ever have a dream?""</i></h3>
<p>Of course we have future plans and we also look for opportunities such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Distribution agreements, wholesale.</li>
<li>Investment opportunities to boost our pipeline with new products.</li>
<li>Partnerships to develop exclusive ingredients.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please feel free to <a href=""mailto:contact@matoxine.com?subject=instant%20moonlight%20crowdfunding&amp;body=Dear%20matoxine%20team%2C%0A"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">contact us</a> with inquiries or other messages.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Risks and challenges, ""<i>over the wall we go</i>""</h3>
<p><strong>instant moonlight </strong>will make it to market anyway, funding is available. Our idea is to scale-up the budgeted pilot study scheduled for the final clinical validation and take this opportunity to produce and offer you a first collection of commercial products, an exclusive pilot series. We look at this crowdfunding campaign as a great opportunity to evaluate market-opportunities and get feedback from you, while offering you unique cosmetics with a large discount. Should we not meet the target budget, we will simply produce less.</p>
<p>The <strong>matoxine</strong> team cumulates many years of experience of peptides from animal venoms, entrepreneurship, the cosmetic industry, design and communication. As we have already validated bioactivity testing and smoothly synthesized the peptide, we are confident about the success of <strong>instant moonlight</strong>. Also, given that the HDB-243 peptide is very selective, used in tiny amounts for local activity on skin only and is too large to penetrate in the body, there is no foreseeable risk of toxicity.</p>
<p>Of course, with science we know to expect the unexpected, and we are used to facing it! Therefore, if any unforeseen surprises arise we will keep you updated and explain how we handle this.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Join us to make it happen and spread the word!</h3>

A ""glass spider""?
Our goal is to develop and offer you ""instant moonlight"" as a unique beauty-care product. This contains the bioactive peptide ""HDB-243"", recently discovered by our team in the venom of the spider Heteropoda davidbowie. This peptide instantly suppresses muscular contractions at the skin surface, reducing wrinkles and giving a ""Botox-like"" effect without the need for injections. Don’t worry: you won’t be putting a real spider on your face! Our product is a perfect copy of the natural peptide.

Revolutionary instant anti-wrinkle cream inspired by natural venoms,
brought to you by matoxine.
 
Beauty from the beast
We are about to make a pilot production of instant moonlight cream in order to finalize clinical validation, achieve all regulatory requirements and product registration. We decided to take this opportunity to produce and offer a first collection of exclusive anti-aging creams.

Illustration of  instant moonlight cosmetics line (designs subject to changes),
high quality products made in Switzerland.
 
instant moonlight is available in two formulations, “day-in, day-out”
Our first products will be launched as a cream in two distinct formulations:


instant moonlight gold cream is used as a daily face cream to plump, firm and moisturise the skin, smooth the appearance of fine lines and provide a more youthful complexion. See jar and dispenser in the middle.


instant moonlight+ platinum is a concentrated cream with special applicator for fast acting and targeted treatment of wrinkles, such as crow’s feet. It is ideal for the treatment of wrinkles in the delicate skin around the eyes and acts within minutes! See wave-pen on the left and click-pen on the right).


Each will be available in two packagings:


For the handbag: instant moonlight gold dispenser & instant moonlight+ platinum click-pen. See on the right.


For the bathroom: instant moonlight gold jar & instant moonlight+ platinum wave-tube. See on the left.



matoxine products are paraben-free and hypoallergenic so they are safe to use even on sensitive skin.

Optimized by evolution - Discovered by us - Made possible by you.
 
Our story...
...from ""station to station""
As an expert in the study of venoms, lover of Nature and David Bowie fan, when eight years ago a shaggy haired yellow spider was named Heteropoda davidbowie, our boss Reto couldn’t resist working on it. Our scientific team investigated the so-called davidbowie spider venom and discovered numerous bioactive peptides over the years. One of these revealed remarkable potential for anti-ageing treatment. We named it HDB-243 (HDB for Heteropoda DavidBowie) and our project began!
 
Who is Heteropoda davidbowie, a ""spider from mars""?
.... and it all started with him. Him? Heteropoda davidbowie of course: the fuzzy blonde Malaysian spider able to create miracles. Let us tell you how.....

Close-up view of our dear friend Heteropoda davidbowie.
Heteropoda davidbowie is a large yellow huntsman spider from Malaysia. It was named in honor of rock star David Bowie in 2008 by its discoverer, German biologist Peter Jäger in order to raise awareness about animal species threatened with extinction. It refers to David Bowie's early 70’s band ""The Spiders From Mars"", songs such as ""Glass Spider"", and the resemblance of the frontal view of the spider to the singer's painted face and orange hairs in his early career.
 
From ""ground control to major tom""...
...we have analyzed the venom in our labs over the past 6 years. This venom is extremely complex, and our work led to the discovery of 136 different bioactive peptides (small proteins). Our original idea was to give each a funny name like stardustine, aladdine, majortomine, lifeonmarsine, spidersfrommarsine, ziggyne, letsdancine, lazarine, and so on. A tribute.

This mass spectrum of a fraction of the venom of Heteropoda davidbowie reveals its complexity.
 
Some of the venom peptides were intriguing, so we decided to… ""move on""!
We investigated their biological activity in the lab on validated pharmaceutical tests (electrophysiology) and one molecule revealed unexpected surprises. This is ""HDB-243"", the active ingredient of instant moonlight: a bioactive peptide, in other words a small protein that has a biological activity.

 
So, how is he going to make us look younger ""the next day""?
HDB-243, the active ingredient of instant moonlight is a bioactive peptide, in other words a small protein that has a biological activity. Our research has demonstrated that it acts on the neuromuscular system. HDB-243 possesses a high potency in blocking a receptor located at the skin surface, which induces instant inhibition of muscle contraction without any need for skin penetration. This relaxes the clenched facial muscles that cause wrinkles and makes skin smoother, for example at crow’s feet around the eyes. instant moonlight cream uses a chemically synthesized version of the peptide, which is a perfect copy of the natural HDB-243 isolated from spider venom.

The HDB-242 peptide blocks receptors of the skin surface preventing contraction by a relaxing effect.
 
matoxine efficacy, a ""moongage daydream""?

We tested instant moonlight on a few volunteers, and were ourselves amazed of the results.
This was after 15 minutes and there is no photo editing!
 
Our Goals
 
So ""where are we now""?
To make this reality and share our passion, we are launching our crowdfunding project. Using our state of the art methods for analyzing animal venoms, we have already identified the molecule HDB-243, confirmed its biological activity in the lab and validted its efficacy as an instant anti-wrinle cream on a few volunteers.
Our goal is now to achieve clinical studies with a first production and offer you theses exclusive products before they even make it to market.
 
Join us on our venomous venture and ""let’s dance""!
Your funding will enable us to advance instant moonlight from the discovery stage to production and market (in USD, $*) and offer you exclusive pre-market products:

$ 5'000.-     Synthesize the HDB-243 peptide
$ 3’000.-     Formulate an exclusive cream
$ 6’000.-     Produce the pilot samples, filling & packaging
$ 2’000.-     Perform expanded toxicity, safety and tolerability testing
$ 8’000.-     Perform additional efficacy studies in humans
$ 1’000.-     Logistics

Total : $ 25'000.-
*1 $) is roughly 1 swiss franc (CHF) or 0.90 euros (EUR, €)
 
""Did you ever have a dream?""
Of course we have future plans and we also look for opportunities such as:

Distribution agreements, wholesale.
Investment opportunities to boost our pipeline with new products.
Partnerships to develop exclusive ingredients.

Please feel free to contact us with inquiries or other messages.
 
Risks and challenges, ""over the wall we go""
instant moonlight will make it to market anyway, funding is available. Our idea is to scale-up the budgeted pilot study scheduled for the final clinical validation and take this opportunity to produce and offer you a first collection of commercial products, an exclusive pilot series. We look at this crowdfunding campaign as a great opportunity to evaluate market-opportunities and get feedback from you, while offering you unique cosmetics with a large discount. Should we not meet the target budget, we will simply produce less.
The matoxine team cumulates many years of experience of peptides from animal venoms, entrepreneurship, the cosmetic industry, design and communication. As we have already validated bioactivity testing and smoothly synthesized the peptide, we are confident about the success of instant moonlight. Also, given that the HDB-243 peptide is very selective, used in tiny amounts for local activity on skin only and is too large to penetrate in the body, there is no foreseeable risk of toxicity.
Of course, with science we know to expect the unexpected, and we are used to facing it! Therefore, if any unforeseen surprises arise we will keep you updated and explain how we handle this.
 
Join us to make it happen and spread the word!
THANK YOU

Did You Know?
 
Venomous animals of the world, can they be ""heroes""?
Venomous animals can be found all around the planet: in the air, on the land or in the depths.

Bottom right is Heteropoda davidbowie.
More than 550'000 species of venomous animals have been described. Venomous animals aren’t just killers: they save lives. Venoms from snakes, spiders, scorpions, snails and many more are a rich natural cocktails, each made of hundreds of proteins, peptides and small molecules. Mother nature has designed these molecules to perfection over millions of years of evolution to act, when used individually, as amazing medicines and cosmetics.
While the cocktail can kill, each molecule can heal.

From venoms to drugs, a ""fantastic voyage""?
Indeed, venom bioactives are a proven source of innovative drugs to treat many major human diseases. Six venom-based drugs are already on the market, and many more are under development. These include drugs to treat hypertension, stroke, angina, diabetes and pain. Venoms also contain molecules that have the potential to make powerful natural cosmetics solutions. As a result, venomous animals have saved more lifes than they killed.

<h2><strong>Short Summary</strong></h2>
<p>The third principle of Kwanzaa is Ujima (collective work and responsibility). It means “to build and maintain our community together and make our brother's and sister's problems our problems and to solve them together.” This is how and why NBUF has instituted its “Feed the Hood” program. Through NBUF’s coalition of organizations and individuals, it has worked to help people of African descent meet the basic needs of food, medical supplies, personal hygiene products and clothes. As a result of capitalism, the majority of resources in this country are controlled by less than ten percent of the population. Therefore it is imperative that people of African descent pool their resources together and work together to solve their problems.</p>

<p><strong>Risks and challenges</strong></p>
<p>Blue Planet has been in business for 25 years and we take our reputation very seriously. We do our very best to make sure every customer is satisfied. <br/>The biggest risk is that production takes longer than anticipated due to unforeseen delays. Once the project is funded, we expect to be able to manufacture and ship all orders by October 2019. We have decades of experience manufacturing sports equipment and work very closely with our factories to maintain superior quality. We have extensively tested our products and stand behind them. There is a full 1-year​ warranty on the boards and accessories and your satisfaction is guaranteed. If for any reason you are not fully satisfied with your Blue Planet products, we are offering a full refund if you return the product within 30 days. In other words, your risk is low. Our goal is to not just make everyone happy but to convert every backer into an ambassador of the Balance Surfer and the Blue Planet brand.</p>

Sustainable Manufacturing & Recycled Cardboard Packaging
Here at Blue Planet, As stand up paddle boarders and surfers, the ocean is our playground and we need to act as its shepherds. We do our best to use environmentally responsible materials, conserve energy, recycle and try to minimize our impact on the environment and the oceans. Here is a short video explaining how we incorporated those values into the Balance Surfer. 

 


Risks and challenges
Blue Planet has been in business for 25 years and we take our reputation very seriously. We do our very best to make sure every customer is satisfied. The biggest risk is that production takes longer than anticipated due to unforeseen delays. Once the project is funded, we expect to be able to manufacture and ship all orders by October 2019. We have decades of experience manufacturing sports equipment and work very closely with our factories to maintain superior quality. We have extensively tested our products and stand behind them. There is a full 1-year​ warranty on the boards and accessories and your satisfaction is guaranteed. If for any reason you are not fully satisfied with your Blue Planet products, we are offering a full refund if you return the product within 30 days. In other words, your risk is low. Our goal is to not just make everyone happy but to convert every backer into an ambassador of the Balance Surfer and the Blue Planet brand.",10.0,4,"1 Campaign

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>At first glance, Rachel Gregory appears to be your typical 25 year old woman.  With a contagious smile and joking nature, she looks fine.  But behind that smile is constant pain. </p>
<p>In 2007, Rachel was diagnosed with Crohn’s disease.  She diligently took her daily prescribed medication, but continued having pain in the upper right quadrant.  The pain got so bad it landed her in the emergency room several times, and the doctors were sure it was her gallbladder.  After months of testing, she was referred to the University of Virginia Medical Center, where she received even more labs, x-rays and scopes.  Finally, a year after the pain started, she was diagnosed with Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis.  PSC, as it’s commonly referred, is a rare, incurable liver disease that causes the bile ducts to become scarred, narrowed and eventually blocked.  The only definitive treatment is a liver transplant, but even then sometimes PSC recurs.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Rachel moved to South Carolina in 2010 and immediately got established with a local specialist.  He kept her on her current regimen of daily pills, but wanted to investigate further into the severity of the PSC.  After an ERCP, a procedure in which a stent is placed in the bile duct in hopes to allow better flow and relieve some pain, Rachel and her family were told she needed a transplant.  Even with the 20 pills a day, the disease was progressing quickly.  An appointment was scheduled with a hepatologist at the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston.</p>
<p>After a GI bleed and a week in the hospital, Rachel’s doctors advised her she could not continue working.  She deserves to be enjoying life; hanging out with her fiancé and friends, traveling, going to work, doing things most 25 year old women don’t think twice about doing.  Instead, she fights a constant battle with intense pain, episodes of confusion, chronic fatigue, and swelling of the legs and feet.  Rachel continues to take over 20 pills a day, just to maintain some degree of normalcy.  Most days simply showering and getting dressed is completely exhausting and requires a nap afterward.  Things that the “average person” can accomplish in minutes take Rachel much longer.   </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Because Rachel lives 4 hours away, the trips to MUSC require her and her caregiver stay overnight in the area.  She is also responsible for maintaining a minimum balance of $3,000 in the bank at all times for various expenses at the time of transplant.  MUSC also states a minimum of $200,000 is needed in order to receive the surgery.  Since Rachel is no longer able to work, she is depending on the kindness of family, friends, and total strangers.  Several fundraisers have been held, and money has been raised, but not nearly enough to cover all of her expenses. </p>
<p>We would obviously love to be able to raise enough money so that Rachel doesn’t have to worry about co-pays, prescriptions, or any other bills during this stressful time.  However, we’ve set a realistic goal of $4000, which is what we were able to raise with our first Indiegogo campaign – surely we can do it again!  If everyone who read this sent in just $1, and forwarded the info to everyone they know, and <em>they</em> sent in just $1, things would snowball and we would have the money we need in no time!</p>

Using our combined skills, we found a way that we felt we could do this. John knew electronics, EJ knew marketing, Capri knew design, Mike knew websites and Kyleah can dance her way around Facebook and the like. John had a great idea for a wireless brake light for cars, bicycles, boats or anything that moved. When we started to research its application in bicycles, we were astonished at the need for them. The accident rate was amazingly high - especially for riders who rode with others or in traffic.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 14px; text-align: justify; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; background-color: #fff; padding: 10px;"">Typical bike brake lights mounted under seat posts were too low (in our opinion), so we modified our original LucidBrake model to be versatile enough to be worn anywhere - it's wireless, so we decided to make it work on helmets, jackets, back packs. But if we could do that, we wondered where else we could mount a LucidBrake and the ideas came flooding in: wheel chairs, animals, animal-powered vehicles, boats, the end of long loads and more. The possibilities are endless!</p>

<hr/>
<p>2 types of braking indicated — Normal stop &amp; Emergency stop. If you have to stop very suddenly, it flashes faster and brighter than if you are coming to a controlled type of stop. When John has to stop suddenly in traffic, he pumps his brakes to create a flashing effect so that the cars behind him get alerted early enough to avert running into him. He built this mode into the brake light and he uses one on his car just so that he doesn't have to do that anymore!</p>
<p>Unlike other brake lights, it doesn't have to be installed or alter the vehicle at all. In fact, it doesn't require it be mounted on a mechanical vehicle at all. This brake can be mounted on a person or a piece of equipment that is riding the ride. This is the first of its kind deceleration light (brake light) that doesn't have to be fixed to a certain position or to a piece of equipment. It literally just knows what to do no matter what position it is in in space.</p>
<p>The concept of a wireless brake light isn't new, it just has never been engineered to such precision functionality.</p>

<a name=""FAQ"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>
<p><big><big><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""> FAQ? </span></strong></big></big><a href=""#top"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""float: right;"">back to top</a></p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>How much does it weigh? </strong></span></p>
<p>LucidBrake is about 23 grams. Two AAA batteries are also about 23 grams. That's very light weight, and that's why when attached to the back of a helmet people say they can't even tell it's there. Your cell phone weighs about 3 times that amount.</p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">How big is a LucidBrake?</span></strong></p>
<p>A standard business card is 3 1/2 inches edge to edge. A LucidBrake is 3 inches edge to edge, so a LucidBrake can't hide a business card.</p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">How does LucidBrake attach to so many different kinds of things?</span></strong></p>
<p>One of the design goals was to be able to mount LucidBrake on a helmet, and conventional mounting solutions just wouldn't work for this.</p>
<p>Engineers at 3M convinced us to try their Dual Lock fasteners. We are glad we did, as these are working perfectly.</p>
<p>Dual Lock fasteners are used to attach metal siding up on buildings in extremes of weather conditions. You peel off a backing, stick identical pads to clean, dry surfaces such as the perfectly flat back of a LucidBrake and your bicycle seat post, back of your helmet, or just about anywhere you want a deceleration light, press together and go. If you park where theft might be a concern, Dual Lock fasteners let you pull them apart so you can take LucidBrake with you. You can pull apart and press together thousands of times.</p>
<p>Each square inch of Dual Lock fastener pads have 250 tiny mushroom headed posts. When pressed together these posts interlock with amazing tenacity. In all our bike testing we've never had a LucidBrake fall off.</p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Can I take it with me so it doesn't get stolen?</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes you can. The Dual Lock fasteners make it easy to detach and reattach LucidBrake to your bicycle or other equipment as many times as desired.</p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Is there a power switch? </span></strong></p>
<p>There's no power switch on a LucidBrake. John created some patentable circuitry that reduces battery current when parked in the garage to a tiny trickle. Calculations show the batteries should last multiple years sitting in the garage. Every few seconds the 3-axis accelerometer is checked to see if any change in orientation has occurred, and if so LucidBrake automatically springs back to life.</p>
<p>The batteries are easily accessed, so if you take LucidBrake with you the batteries can be removed to prevent bright flashing red lights where you probably don't want them.</p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Is it patentable?</span></strong></p>

FAQ'S




The goal at LucidLights, LLC (makers of the LucidBrake) is to make the world a better place. Using our combined skills, we found a way that we felt we could do this. John knew electronics, EJ knew marketing, Capri knew design, Mike knew websites and Kyleah can dance her way around Facebook and the like. John had a great idea for a wireless brake light for cars, bicycles, boats or anything that moved. When we started to research its application in bicycles, we were astonished at the need for them. The accident rate was amazingly high - especially for riders who rode with others or in traffic.
Typical bike brake lights mounted under seat posts were too low (in our opinion), so we modified our original LucidBrake model to be versatile enough to be worn anywhere - it's wireless, so we decided to make it work on helmets, jackets, back packs. But if we could do that, we wondered where else we could mount a LucidBrake and the ideas came flooding in: wheel chairs, animals, animal-powered vehicles, boats, the end of long loads and more. The possibilities are endless!

2 stopping modes (normal stop & emergency stop)

4 different types of beacon modes:


Bike racing mode (no awareness beacon, 2-types braking mode)
Tail light mode (dim awareness beacon light on all the time & 2-types braking mode)
Cylon mode (bright flashing lights going vertically up and down the sides of brake light & 2-types braking mode)
Rotator mode (2 bright lights that travel around the brake & 2 types braking mode)

mounts anywhere (no wiring at all)

 Why LucidBrake is better than any other brake light. 


no installation - no hardware or wires to hook up
attaches to anything including clothing
emergency braking indicator
works well over any terrain
functions appropriately at any speed, on any type of vehicle
water proof, not just resistant
Ultra bright
Works on horse-drawn vehicles, horse saddles or horse riders
Works on wheel chairs or scooters



 
So what's the big deal?

2 types of braking indicated — Normal stop & Emergency stop. If you have to stop very suddenly, it flashes faster and brighter than if you are coming to a controlled type of stop. When John has to stop suddenly in traffic, he pumps his brakes to create a flashing effect so that the cars behind him get alerted early enough to avert running into him. He built this mode into the brake light and he uses one on his car just so that he doesn't have to do that anymore!
Unlike other brake lights, it doesn't have to be installed or alter the vehicle at all. In fact, it doesn't require it be mounted on a mechanical vehicle at all. This brake can be mounted on a person or a piece of equipment that is riding the ride. This is the first of its kind deceleration light (brake light) that doesn't have to be fixed to a certain position or to a piece of equipment. It literally just knows what to do no matter what position it is in in space.
The concept of a wireless brake light isn't new, it just has never been engineered to such precision functionality.
Who needs a LucidBrake?



Everybody! Specifically all bike riders for sure, especially if you ride your bike to/from/during work..
For example: 

Professional Bicyclists

Pedicab drivers

Horse and carriage drivers 

Patrolmen (Bike or Horse Patrol) (Police / Paramedic) 

Mail Couriers 

Newspaper Delivery 

Missionaries 

Construction or Landscape drivers who always have long loads and trailers

Bicycle Commuters 


LucidBrake is an anywhere brake light. It can attach to ANYTHING that moves, if you move - you need a LucidBrake!

 FAQ? back to top
How much does it weigh? 
LucidBrake is about 23 grams. Two AAA batteries are also about 23 grams. That's very light weight, and that's why when attached to the back of a helmet people say they can't even tell it's there. Your cell phone weighs about 3 times that amount.
How big is a LucidBrake?
A standard business card is 3 1/2 inches edge to edge. A LucidBrake is 3 inches edge to edge, so a LucidBrake can't hide a business card.
How does LucidBrake attach to so many different kinds of things?
One of the design goals was to be able to mount LucidBrake on a helmet, and conventional mounting solutions just wouldn't work for this.
Engineers at 3M convinced us to try their Dual Lock fasteners. We are glad we did, as these are working perfectly.
Dual Lock fasteners are used to attach metal siding up on buildings in extremes of weather conditions. You peel off a backing, stick identical pads to clean, dry surfaces such as the perfectly flat back of a LucidBrake and your bicycle seat post, back of your helmet, or just about anywhere you want a deceleration light, press together and go. If you park where theft might be a concern, Dual Lock fasteners let you pull them apart so you can take LucidBrake with you. You can pull apart and press together thousands of times.
Each square inch of Dual Lock fastener pads have 250 tiny mushroom headed posts. When pressed together these posts interlock with amazing tenacity. In all our bike testing we've never had a LucidBrake fall off.
Can I take it with me so it doesn't get stolen?
Yes you can. The Dual Lock fasteners make it easy to detach and reattach LucidBrake to your bicycle or other equipment as many times as desired.
Is there a power switch? 
There's no power switch on a LucidBrake. John created some patentable circuitry that reduces battery current when parked in the garage to a tiny trickle. Calculations show the batteries should last multiple years sitting in the garage. Every few seconds the 3-axis accelerometer is checked to see if any change in orientation has occurred, and if so LucidBrake automatically springs back to life.
The batteries are easily accessed, so if you take LucidBrake with you the batteries can be removed to prevent bright flashing red lights where you probably don't want them.
Is it patentable?
When applying for our provisional patent we searched for similar patents, and we did find one, by an overseas company. However, LucidBrake does extend the state of the art, and here's why. The other people's patent describes the use of only one axis of acceleration to detect braking, and they go out of their way to explain the behavior on hills and slopes based on the use of just one axis. The very last sentence of their patent is this.. 'That is why this invention is called ""wireless brake light"" instead of ""wireless deceleration light'.
LucidBrake, on the other hand, is truly a deceleration light, and not just a brake light.

There's more to our provisional patent, but this shortened explanation is at the heart of the differences.
So, LucidBrake can be mounted on the back of a helmet! (Theirs won't work there as described in their patent.) As the user rotates their head, most of the rotation effect is ignored, yet when the bicycle decelerates it detects and signals it.

<p>Sex education is non-existent in the Indonesian education system and access to information about reproductive health and rights, such as family planning, use of contraception and understanding of STIs, such as HIV and AIDS, is limited (and where available is often only on offer to married women).

As a result many of these women seek illegal, often unsafe abortions. An estimated 2 million illegal abortions take place in Indonesia every year, the majority of these are unsafe. It is not known how many woman die as a result of complications after unsafe abortion. However, one woman dies every hour from pregnancy or birth related incidents in Indonesia - it is estimated that 13% of these deaths are a result of unsafe abortions.

<p class=""p1"">FitFriend is bringing <strong>old</strong> Sportswatch behaviour to the iPhone. While in addition, bringing you <strong>new</strong> ways to map out runs, train in increments, and eventually coaching. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Something got lost in translation in porting the first wave of apps from that Garmin or Timex watch that you traditionally used, to the mobile device. Essential functionality such as ""laps"" were missed out on, while at the same time non-essential functionality such as ""badges"" or whatever added to the clutter. </p>
<p class=""p1"">You may have switched from your watch to your mobile device to log your workouts. Then switched back, because you found your watch is still better. Or you haven't switched back, but you're left wishing the mobile captured the kind of training your watch captures. You don't know whether you're missing out on more, by using a watch or a mobile.</p>
<p class=""p1"">This is because the current crop of running apps are cluttered, and irrelevant to runner's needs.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Runners still use their watches over apps, and for a good reason. Because the watch tracks times relevant to the variety of training that you get from any good running program. Runners are still choosing to use their watches, for training such as ""intervals"", ""hills"", ""tempo"", ""fartlek"". This has to change, the world has gone mobile now.</p>
<p class=""p1"">FitFriend is bringing old reliable behaviour + new intuitive behaviour, to the mobile.</p>
<p class=""p1""> </p>
<h3 class=""p1"">WHO We Are</h3>
<p class=""p1"">Currently a 1-man shop, Mike Post is founder and CTO. Seeing as it's just me at the moment, I'm going to switch from the 3rd person now :) I come from 3 backgrounds - running, music &amp; audio engineering, and computer engineering.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Running competitively as a teen in orienteering, and for my high school track &amp; field team, training has been a part of my life in some way for almost 2 decades.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Playing music was also a big part of my life as a teen, and I studied the technology side of it at university for 3 years in my twenties. Not having enough of university, or technology, I returned 2 years later to study computer engineering. I've been working as a software engineer for almost 5 years now, mainly in mobile apps.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Sometimes you get a calling though, when you realise that something isn't as good as it could be - and that brings us to where we are now. Using my experience in running and engineering, to bring you kickass products. To me, quality matters most - that's going to be reflected in FitFriend products.</p>
<p class=""p1""> </p>
<h3 class=""p1"">WHAT We Need</h3>
<p class=""p1"">Your contributions, and your passion, to help drive this forward. Most of the engineering work has been completed for the initial release on iOS, and is currently entering beta testing. Choose 1 of the following perks to your right, from Spectator, Casual, Active, Competitor, or Olympian.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Funding will be directed to the incomplete work, for the initial iPhone release. in order of priority:</p>
<p class=""p1"">- Graphics</p>
<p class=""p1"">- Feature enhancements </p>
<p class=""p1"">- iOS7 support</p>
<p class=""p1"">- Marketing / Advertising </p>
<p class=""p1"">If the amount raised surpasses the goal of $5000, and reaches $10,000 the additional funding will be directed to future expansion:</p>
<p class=""p1"">- Pebble integration</p>
<p class=""p1"">- Coaching services</p>
<p class=""p1"">- Servers and iCloud integration</p>
<p class=""p1"">If the amount raised surpasses $20,000, the additional funding will be directed to the next line of future expansion:</p>
<p class=""p1"">- Blackberry10 release</p>
<p class=""p1"">- WP8 release</p>
<p class=""p1"">- Android release</p>
<p class=""p1""> </p>
<h3 class=""p1"">LONGTERM</h3>
<p class=""p1"">When things get crazy and we eventually have a large amount of funding available, there are some new types of hardware products in the pipeline, that will turn the way you do workouts upside down. </p>
<p class=""p1""> </p>
<h3 class=""p1""><strong>PROMOTION</strong></h3>
<p class=""p1"">Can't offer funding? Or merely want to help out more? No problem - you can do that AND we can even <em>give you</em> <em>something </em>in return! </p>
<p class=""p1"">All you need to do is to dress as a giant chicken and stand on a street corner, for 100 hours. Kidding! Instead, share the campaign using the share tools above. </p>
<p class=""p1"">We'll give $200, to the person whose sharing, has led to the most amount of contributions. Ok? So anyone who <strong>logs into Indiegogo</strong>, and shares the campaign on Twitter, Facebook, or elsewhere, qualifies for this $200 prize! But only if you <strong>log into Indiegogo</strong> - otherwise we have no way of tracking you.</p>

Not having enough of university, or technology, I returned 2 years later to study computer engineering. I've been working as a software engineer for almost 5 years now, mainly in mobile apps.
Sometimes you get a calling though, when you realise that something isn't as good as it could be - and that brings us to where we are now. Using my experience in running and engineering, to bring you kickass products. To me, quality matters most - that's going to be reflected in FitFriend products.
 
WHAT We Need
Your contributions, and your passion, to help drive this forward. Most of the engineering work has been completed for the initial release on iOS, and is currently entering beta testing. Choose 1 of the following perks to your right, from Spectator, Casual, Active, Competitor, or Olympian.
Funding will be directed to the incomplete work, for the initial iPhone release. in order of priority:
- Graphics
- Feature enhancements 
- iOS7 support
- Marketing / Advertising 
If the amount raised surpasses the goal of $5000, and reaches $10,000 the additional funding will be directed to future expansion:
- Pebble integration
- Coaching services
- Servers and iCloud integration
If the amount raised surpasses $20,000, the additional funding will be directed to the next line of future expansion:
- Blackberry10 release
- WP8 release
- Android release
 
LONGTERM
When things get crazy and we eventually have a large amount of funding available, there are some new types of hardware products in the pipeline, that will turn the way you do workouts upside down. 
 
PROMOTION
Can't offer funding? Or merely want to help out more? No problem - you can do that AND we can even give you something in return! 
All you need to do is to dress as a giant chicken and stand on a street corner, for 100 hours. Kidding! Instead, share the campaign using the share tools above. 
We'll give $200, to the person whose sharing, has led to the most amount of contributions. Ok? So anyone who logs into Indiegogo, and shares the campaign on Twitter, Facebook, or elsewhere, qualifies for this $200 prize! But only if you log into Indiegogo - otherwise we have no way of tracking you.
NOTE: I have to give credit to Tracy McMillan here for the same kind of promotion in Localeikki's excellent recreation database app :) If you're feeling extra generous, you can fund that here too.
 
Thank you for listening. We promise you that FitFriend will be a lot more exciting than this boring chunk of text you just read through. Stay tuned for more updates, by following us on Twitter or Facebook!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Srečko and I would like
to share a thought with you. While we live in a fast changing world of new
technologies and their applications, we sometimes tend to forget about
ourselves and our own comfort, while developing them.</p><p></p><p></p><p>I assume, most
of you work in a sitting position as I do. In spite of my very comfortable
chair I still get very tired at the
end of the day and my body
subconsciously forces me to sit or lie down even more.</p><p></p><p></p><p>So, I had to
do something about it! To prevent this constant feeling of fatigue after the work day I created the EASEBelt. The EASEBelt provides a much needed
support, which enables me to sit straight up and
consequently feel relaxed, well rested and able to do anything even after a
hard day at work! It was a surprise even to me how good I
felt! My enthusiasm grew after I realized, that I got up easily and not
feeling tired at all after
long hours spent behind the desk. I have to admit it was a wonderful feeling.</p><p></p><p></p><p>And everyone
who tried it claim the same!  </p><p></p><p></p><p>Finally, this is what I'm here for – I'm here to present the
EASEBelt, the supportive and comfortable product.</p>
<p>The EASEBelt is very easy to use, convenient to wear, as well as adjustable to meet your needs and provide you the well-being you deserve.</p><p></p><p></p><p>I realized the
positive change in my life very quickly, and my family noticed my energy as
well. Especially my daughter, a recent graduate from the Faculty of Economics, who
immediately saw the business opportunity. She suggested to develop the product further and involved some of her friends. The project has been taken over now by young and
ambitious people that my
daughter introduced to the EASEBelt, and I'm glad to see their progress.</p><p></p><p></p><p>So, you might noticed the
various applications of
EASEBelt and now it is up to you to experience how pleasant
it is to work in the ''embrace of comfort''!</p><p></p><p></p><p style=""text-align: left;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/229270/files/20131128052657-P_Sami-Rahim-1.jpg?1385645217"" src="""" style=""line-height: 1.45em;""/><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Srečko Pisnik (photo by Sami Rahim)</span><br/></p><p style=""text-align: right;""><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><br/></span></p><p></p><p></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/208708/files/20131119051559-whatisnext.png?1384866959"" src="""" style=""width: 568px; height: 117px;""/><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">We came to a point where idea of EASEBelt has become a product suitable for use.

sitting has the worst impact on our health. The spine
endures 75% more pressure when we

freedom of movement and blood circulation.Negative force (our own body weight) is reduced with the positive force (which you regulate yourself to your own needs) provided by EASEBelt!1. Simply put it
on the back of a chair. Elastic fabrics allows you to install EASEBelt on the various shapes and forms of chairs.2. Fasten yourself with the base ‘’hook and  loop” part of the belt.3. With double
pull elastic straps, EASEBelt can be easily strengthen or weaken. You simply
adjusted it to your own need.Clik here for EASEBelt 360° projection!Hello everybody!My name is
Srečko and I would like
to share a thought with you. While we live in a fast changing world of new
technologies and their applications, we sometimes tend to forget about
ourselves and our own comfort, while developing them.I assume, most
of you work in a sitting position as I do. In spite of my very comfortable
chair I still get very tired at the
end of the day and my body
subconsciously forces me to sit or lie down even more.So, I had to
do something about it! To prevent this constant feeling of fatigue after the work day I created the EASEBelt. The EASEBelt provides a much needed
support, which enables me to sit straight up and
consequently feel relaxed, well rested and able to do anything even after a
hard day at work! It was a surprise even to me how good I
felt! My enthusiasm grew after I realized, that I got up easily and not
feeling tired at all after
long hours spent behind the desk. I have to admit it was a wonderful feeling.And everyone
who tried it claim the same!  Finally, this is what I'm here for – I'm here to present the
EASEBelt, the supportive and comfortable product.
The EASEBelt is very easy to use, convenient to wear, as well as adjustable to meet your needs and provide you the well-being you deserve.I realized the
positive change in my life very quickly, and my family noticed my energy as
well. Especially my daughter, a recent graduate from the Faculty of Economics, who
immediately saw the business opportunity. She suggested to develop the product further and involved some of her friends. The project has been taken over now by young and
ambitious people that my
daughter introduced to the EASEBelt, and I'm glad to see their progress.So, you might noticed the
various applications of
EASEBelt and now it is up to you to experience how pleasant
it is to work in the ''embrace of comfort''!Srečko Pisnik (photo by Sami Rahim)We came to a point where idea of EASEBelt has become a product suitable for use. After more than two years of testing and
improvements, it is now time to be at users disposal.
Product design, basic models sewing, testing and
preparation of the obligatory administration have been our own investment so
far. We believe that all the effort and invested money can not compare with satisfaction
and benefits EASEBelt offers to the users. 
We need your help to improve the final product design and to begin with an optimal production volume.
The entire supply chain of the materials and manufacturing have to be planned carefully to ensure desired
quality and consistency. We are only collaborating with people and
businesses that we believe to be the best for this project. 
Be among the first to support this product and
thereby receive one of the EASEBelt perk package. With
your support we will make our idea a reality, and all of us will be able to work in
""the embrace of comfort"" after 1.3.2014!We will greatly appreciate all of your support either by pledging or by getting the word about the project out there!Thank you for being a part of our mission! EASEBelt team (from left: Dejan Pisnik, Srečko Pisnik, Jasmina Pisnik and Aljoša Antolin) (photo by Sami Rahim)We will fly you and another person to our beautiful country Slovenia! EASEBelt team will take you to all the AMAZING places worth experiencing; this includes the oldest vine in the world (over 400 years), the mysterious caves, our   beautiful lakes, soulful cities, refreshing seaside, mouth watering national food and wine, etc.You will receive a tailor made EASEBelts for you and your family.We will find some time to talk about business as well as you get a chance of getting an exclusive franchise contract for a particular country. After your pledge an email will be send to you, so you can inform us of your preferences: If you want a Men's or Women's EASEBelt and what size would you like.Perk 2Please add $5 for shipping in the EU. Please add $10 for shipping outside the EU.Perk 3Please add $25 for shipping in the EU.Please add $35 for shipping outside the EU.Perk 4Please add $45 for shipping in the EU.Please add $55 for shipping outside the EU.Our biggest challenge is to inform everyone that this is not yet another marketing hoax and that the product actually helps to improve the quality of life and makes sitting a comfortable experience.
Please keep in mind that the product is still a prototype. Design of the final product may be changed.
Note that EASEBelt is not an equivalent substitute for mandatory seat belt where it is required.

<h3></h3><h3><span>Short Summary</span></h3>
<p>Struggling with obesity is difficult. I know. I am a certified Fitness Instructor who struggled with it all through childhood and most of my adulthood... Until about six years ago when I was able to lose the weight, and even better, keep it off. I became passionate about helping others do the same. I bought Sweatshop Urban Gym &amp; Fitness Studio six months ago so I could focus on doing just that. We offer group fitness classes, weight loss challenges and personal training geared towards weight loss and lifestyle changes. We have 15 classes each week and we just completed a ten week weight loss challenge where six participants lost over 95 lbs. We were so excited and ready to start another challenge and add more fitness classes, but we're struggling because the equipment is in poor condition. The gym has been around for some time and the equipment that came with it is old and starting to fall apart. I'm limited to the number of people I can have in a class because we don't have enough dumbbells, medicine balls or punching bags. I created this campaign, hoping to raise enough money for new punching bags for kickboxing (an awesome way to burn calories), as well as aerobic steps, new mats and flooring, medicine balls and other needed equipment so we can run weight loss challenges and clinics year round.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We’re hoping to raise $10,000, and since kickboxing is the best way to torch calories and is so much fun, we will spend most of that on new punching bags and the frames to hold them. We will also be able to get new matted floors for safety when kickboxing and doing other drills. With what’s left, we will purchase aerobic steps, medicine balls, resistance tubes and dumbbells.</p>
<p>We have several different contribution levels, starting as low as $10. With your contributions, you will receive photos of the new equipment, heartfelt thanks you’s and contributions above $50, you will receive personally designed workout programs to meet YOUR fitness goals, memberships to fitness classes, even one-on-one personal training.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Our goal is simple… Help people of all ages live healthier, longer, fuller lives. Your contributions will help us do just that. I know investing money right now is hard. Times are tough and we all work hard for what we make. But your contribution will have a lasting impact on so many people. We’re experienced at helping others lose weight, keep it off, live healthy and feel better, and we want to continue our mission. Any contribution you can give will be so appreciated.</p>
<br/><p></p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Please share this campaign with everyone you know. Together, we can reach our goal, get new equipment, and fill this studio up with people eager for fitness and motivated to live a healthy lifestyle.</p>

<p><b>How do uRADMonior devices work?</b></p>
<p>uRADMonior devices are packed with powerful sensors, capable of detecting both the chemical and the physical harmful factors, that can impact our lifespan and cause life threatening diseases. Readings can be viewed instantly on the devices that have a display. All readings are centralised automatically on <a href=""http://www.uradmonitor.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.uradmonitor.com</a>. Online data allows us to build graphs, stats and send automated notifications when certain thresholds are reached.</p>
<p><b>Who can benefit from these devices? Why should I get one?</b></p>
<p>Anyone, with or without a device can benefit from this project. The <a href=""http://www.uradmonitor.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.uradmonitor.com</a> is available for free, offering valuable uncensored pollution statistics and graphs, around the world. If you want to get specific information on your own location you can purchase a device and by doing so you get to contribute to the entire network as well.</p><p>Every day synthetic, toxic chemicals are released into the environment. The air is what we breathe; what travels through the air is what we inhale. As it ultimately affects the future of our planet and us, it is considered to be a global threat at huge cost to the environment.<br/></p><p>People with allergies, asthma, lung cancer or other respiratory diseases can benefit the most from these devices, as their health state might not give them the option to ignore excessive dust, pollen, high concentration of toxic chemicals or highly polluted traffic areas. Knowing the facts might be a life saver for people that are already ill and a good preventer for us all.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1449582727/lcyz93xsdzlzxivlc4nl.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<p><b>What is radiation?</b></p>
<p>Radiation may be defined as energy traveling through space. Non-ionizing radiation, like:microwaves, lasers, radio waves, infrared light, radar or ultraviolet light is essential to life, but excessive exposures will cause tissue damage, whereas all forms of ionizing radiation, like: the cosmic radiation that passes the atmosphere, x-ray used for screenings or the decay of radioactive isotopes especially found near uranium mines and nuclear plants, can cause damage to living tissue, and can result in mutation, radiation sickness, cancer, and death.</p>
<p>Radiation sources are found in a wide range of occupational settings like: airline crew (the most exposed population), industrial radiography, medical radiology and nuclear medicine, uranium mining , nuclear power plant, research laboratories. Massive particles are a concern for astronauts outside the earth's magnetic field who would receive solar particles from solar proton events (SPE) and galactic cosmic rays from cosmic sources.</p>
<p>The public also is exposed to radiation from consumer products, such as tobacco (polonium-210), combustible fuels (gas, coal, etc.), televisions, luminous watches and dials (tritium), airport X-ray systems, smoke detectors (americium), electron tubes, and gas lantern mantles (thorium). Air travel exposes people on aircraft to increased radiation from space up to 40 times more compared to the ground level.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1449582609/ofaturwpbuqlf5df9xye.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<p><b>How can radiation affect my health?</b></p>
<p>If radiation is not properly controlled it can be potentially hazardous to the health. Ionizing radiation — the kind that minerals, atom bombs and nuclear reactors emit — does one main thing to the human body: it weakens and breaks up DNA, either damaging cells enough to kill them or causing them to mutate in ways that may eventually lead to cancer.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1449584485/s2qrbteqs4djuaqygyas.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1449584841/wbcfpljencatdqscnazl.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<p><b>What are VOCs?</b></p>
<p>Volatile organic compounds, sometimes referred to as VOCs, are chemicals that easily become vapours or gases, that contain carbon and are found in all living things. Along with carbon, they contain elements such as hydrogen, oxygen, fluorine, chlorine, bromine, sulfur or nitrogen.</p>
<p>Volatile organic compounds are released from burning fuel, such as gasoline, wood, coal, or natural gas. They are also emitted from oil and gas fields and diesel exhaust. Other sources include: solvents, paints, glues, and other products some of which can be used or stored at home and at work.</p>
<p>Many volatile organic compounds are also hazardous air pollutants. Volatile organic compounds, when combined with nitrogen oxides, react to form ground-level ozone, or smog, which can contribute to climate change.</p>
<p>Examples of volatile organic compounds are gasoline, benzene, formaldehyde, solvents such as toluene and xylene, styrene, and perchloroethylene, the main solvent used in dry cleaning.</p>
<p>Many volatile organic compounds are commonly used in paint thinners, lacquer thinners, moth repellents, air fresheners, hobby supplies, wood preservatives, aerosol sprays, degreasers, automotive products, and dry cleaning fluids.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1449582875/ydxz8r3cghhj4yumbona.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<p><b>How might I be exposed to volatile organic compounds?</b></p>
<p>Volatile organic compounds are common air pollutants found in most of the air. You can be exposed to volatile organic compounds outdoors by breathing polluted air that contains them. You are most likely to be exposed to volatile organic compounds outdoors in the summer, when the sun and hot temperatures react with pollution or during the foggy winter days,to form smog, causing various respiratory health diseases.</p>
<p>Indoors, products that contain volatile organic compounds release emissions when you use them, and to a smaller degree, when they are stored. You can be exposed to volatile organic compounds at home when you are cooking like grilling and frying or  when you use cleaning, painting, or hobby supplies products that contain VOCs. You can also be exposed if you dry clean your clothes with home dry-cleaning products; if you dry-clean your clothes at a professional dry-cleaner; or if you use graphics and crafts materials such as glues, permanent markers, and photographic solutions.</p>
<p>At work, you can be exposed to volatile organic compounds if involved with dry cleaning, in a photography studio, or an office that uses copiers, printers, or correction fluids. You can also be exposed if you work in chemical manufacturing or with petroleum-based products.</p>
<p><b>How can volatile organic compounds affect my health?</b></p>
<p>The health effects of volatile organic compounds can vary greatly according to the compound, which can range from being highly toxic to having no known health effects. The health effects of volatile organic compounds will depend on the nature of the volatile organic compound, the level of exposure, and the length of exposure.</p>
<p>According to the Thirteenth Report on Carcinogens published by the National Toxicology Program, benzene and formaldehyde are human carcinogens; perchloroethylene and styrene are ""reasonably anticipated to be human carcinogens."" People at the highest risk of long-term exposure to these three volatile organic compounds are industrial workers who have prolonged exposure to the compounds used at the workplace; cigarette smokers; and people who have prolonged exposure to emissions from heavy motor vehicle traffic.</p>
<p>Long-term exposure to volatile organic compounds can cause damage to the liver, kidneys, and central nervous system. Short-term exposure to volatile organic compounds can cause eye and respiratory tract irritation, headaches, dizziness, visual disorders, fatigue, loss of coordination, allergic skin reactions, nausea, and memory impairment.</p>
<p><b>How does dust affect my health?</b></p>
<p>Very small particles can be deeply respired into the lungs and remain there. 
These type of particles, small enough to be inhaled may cause: irritation of the eyes, coughing, sneezing, hayfever or asthma attacks.</p>
<p>Other dust-related, human-health concerns include airborne transmission of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, and fungus) and the compositions of certain hazardous dust particles.</p>
<p>Some minerals in dust are extremely hazardous, such as certain asbestiform minerals or silica because of their ability to lodge in lung tissue and promote disease such as lung cancer. Other minerals may contain potentially toxic elements, such as certain heavy metals.</p>
<p><b>Does the device detect pollen?</b></p>
<p>uRADMonitor Model D, does not have a specific pollen detector, but pollen particles would be detected just like other particulate matter.</p>
<p><b>How does CO affect my health?</b></p>
<p>Carbon monoxide, or CO, is a toxic gas that you cannot see or smell. CO is given off whenever fuel or other carbon-based materials are burned with insufficient air.
Breathing CO can cause headache, dizziness, vomiting, and nausea. If CO levels are high enough, you may become unconscious or die. Exposure to moderate and high levels of CO over long periods of time has also been linked with increased risk of heart disease. People who survive severe CO poisoning may suffer long-term health problems.</p>
<p>Scientists are not sure what the health effects are when a person is exposed to low levels of CO over a long period of time. Better tracking of CO poisoning and exposure can help us learn about the effects of long-term exposures to low levels of CO.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1449581657/gwe1gwx6bmggg3ranxht.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<p><b>How does knowing all the pollutants I’m being exposed to, get to help me?</b></p>
<p><i>""Like in many other mornings, my wife was preparing the breakfast, she was making toast for the breakfast. I’ve made some tests with uRADMonitor Model D an evening before, and the device was still running in the kitchen. I instantly received a notification on my phone with VOCs being on dangerous levels. At first I thought it could not be all of the sudden and it must be a false alarm, since the device was in its beta testing days, but then I realised it was actually the toast producing all the harmful gasses. We stopped this harmful habit right away!</i></p>
<p><i>One morning we took a ride through the city to test the air quality with the newly mounted experimental setup. We gathered data from almost 2 hours of driving, even passing a few times through the same place. As you can see in the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqk35oEuSxE"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">video</a>, data was automatically sent and displayed on the mobile, although without a map it was hard to appreciate the readings on site. Once we arrived home I’ve mapped all readings and I was surprised so see that on one of the streets the radiation levels were gradually increasing as we approached a location and then they were gradually decreasing as we were driving away from that place, meaning there was some kind of radioactive source in there. It might have been the basalt or granite used for construction which can contain uranium or some kind of radioactive waste and I'm tempted to dig more on this problem.</i></p>
<p><i>In some of the days, especially when the temperatures dropped we were more tempted to skip house ventilation too often so VOCs levels, especially from cooking and use of certain housekeeping products were increasing high enough to receive an alert on phone. This worked as a great reminder to ventilate our home!""</i>  said Radu Motisan</p>
<p>These are just a few of the situations we’ve faced since testing uRADMonitor, but normally we might have never guessed what's there. So the answer is definitely, YES! There are actions we can take in certain situations, to minimise air pollution around us, instantly.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1449581776/ofbrqsy4qdjabuwz9xds.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<h3>Did you know?</h3><div>
<p><b>Indoor air quality can be up to 10 times worse than outdoor?</b></p>
<p><b>Some of the most dangerous VOCs are CO, formaldehyde and benzene and the last two are found in diesel emissions?</b></p>
<p>Sooty, smelly <b>diesel exhaust</b> is more than just unpleasant -- it's a mix of more than 40 toxic air contaminants and has been linked to cancer, asthma and more than 21,000 premature deaths across USA every year. Many Americans live and work near diesel hotspots such as truck depots, bus terminals, ports, construction sites and busy roads and highways. Some studies have shown that kids riding inside diesel school buses can be exposed to higher levels of unhealthy diesel soot than people riding in nearby cars.</p>
<p><b>Formaldehyde</b> is a cancer-causing chemical used for a number of purposes, including the manufacture of insulation, pesticides and disinfectants. But most industrial emissions of formaldehyde -- 42 percent -- are from the lumber industry, which uses adhesives containing formaldehyde to make plywood. Formaldehyde has been linked to lung cancer, and may also cause leukemia and asthma attacks. Diesel emissions also contribute to formaldehyde pollution.</p>
<p>To minimize formaldehyde exposures at home, make sure any wood furniture or fixtures that use particleboard are laminated or otherwise coated, choose exterior- rather than interior-grade pressed wood products for remodelling and be sure that areas where you are using products containing formaldehyde are well ventilated.</p>
<p>Used in motor fuels, solvents, detergents, pesticides and many other substances, <b>benzene</b> is a carcinogen that causes leukemia as well as a number of other illnesses. Virtually the entire U.S. population is exposed to benzene in at least small amounts -- at gas stations (it's in the gasoline), in diesel exhaust or from cigarette smoke, including second-hand smoke. Benzene also a problem in a number of workplaces, including oil refineries, coal-coking operations at steel mills, chemical processing plants, rubber manufacturing plants and laboratories, where it is often used as a solvent for other chemicals. You can avoid one significant source of benzene by stepping away from the gas pump when refuelling your car.</p>
<p><b>When you inhale microscopic bits of particulate matter -- otherwise known as soot -- fine particles can become embedded in your lungs and impair their function?</b></p>
<p>As many as 64,000 premature deaths occur each year from cardiopulmonary causes attributable to <b>particulate air pollution</b>. Most particulate emissions result from burning fossil fuels -- coal, oil, diesel, gasoline -- or wood. Old coal-fired power plants, industrial boilers, diesel and gas-powered vehicles and wood stoves are some of the worst culprits. High-temperature industrial processes such as metal smelting and steel production are also significant sources.</p>
<p>Everyone can help cut down on particulate matter pollution by conserving energy and choosing cleaner, more efficient energy sources for home heating and cooling, transportation, and appliances. Certainly, limiting your use of wood-burning fireplaces and stoves is a good start.</p>
<p><b>Exposure to radon is estimated to be the second leading cause of lung cancer?</b></p>
<p>It accounts for an estimated 21,000 lung cancer deaths each year (range of 8,000 to 45,000). <b>Radon</b> is a tasteless, colourless and odorless gas that is produced by decaying uranium and occurs naturally in soil and rock. The majority of these deaths occur among smokers since there is a greater risk for lung cancer when smokers also are exposed to radon.</p>

<h3>Why crowdfunding?</h3>
<p>uRADMonitor is a project that started from passion and personal need of its creator of acquiring uncensored, real time pollution information. Radu Motisan updated his progress on his personal blog: <a href=""http://www.pocketmagic.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.pocketmagic.net</a> with his weekly entries . Many of his visitors became interested in this project contributing with ideas. Soon what started as a hobby transformed into a product that further developed as a community project. This is why uRADMonitor needs your support! We believe that by bringing uRADMonitor project to a higher scale, we can accomplish our goal of increasing awareness on pollution dangers, consequently helping us all fight against its factors.
By contributing to this project you will get involved in this great mission along with other people that believe in our work and share our vision.</p>

<h3>Frequently asked questions</h3>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b>Where  are the devices shipped from?</b></div>
<div>uRADMonitor is made by a company registered in the EU. But, to reduce costs, production is made in China. Therefore all devices will be shipped from China.  The customers have the responsibility of paying any customs charges, including VAT. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<p><b>Do I need a mobile or do I have to download a software, for these devices to work?</b></p>
<p>No. All models have been designed to work as standalone devices. No mobile or other software required.</p>
<p><b>Will I receive notifications/allerts when threshold are reached?</b></p>
<p>Yes, you will get immediate specific notifications.</p>
<p><b>Do they work indoor and outdoor?</b></p>
<p>uRADMonitor Model D is a portable device, you can take it with you wherever you are.</p>
<p>Although Model A is a fixed dosimeter and does not have a display, you can take it with you anywhere you have internet access, all readings will be visible on <a href=""http://www.uradmonitor.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.uradmonitor.com</a></p>
<p>KIT1 can be used both as a fixed monitoring station or a mobile unit.</p>
<p><b>How do the devices communicate with the server?</b></p>
<p>Model D has a built in wifi module to connect to the internet wirelessly. Model A and Model KIT1 use an ethernet connection by cable to your internet router. Everything is plug and play. The devices simply get an IP via DHCP and they are ready to talk to the server.</p>
<p><b>How long does the battery last?</b></p>
<p>uRADMonitor D currently has a high capacity 1500mAh lithium battery which can support normal system functions for as long as 12 hours of use.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1449582959/brscqrrnb63mznncjqgh.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p><b>Are the devices waterproof?</b></p>
<p>Although we’ve designed the models so that all sensors are minimally exposed to elements, these devices are measuring the air quality, so a good air flow is necessary. You should avoid water getting into your Model D unit! Model A is a fixed dosimeter that can be mounted outside as it's rainproofed when installed vertically with cables down. KIT1 depends on your own enclosing solution.</p>
<p><b>What is the operating temperature?</b></p>
<p>Model A has been successfully tested to function properly in a -25° C +65° C.</p>
<p><b>Who can see the readings from my device?</b></p>
<p>All data is open source, so the idea is to share all readings on the portal unless you opt-out. Additionally you can configure the location displayed on the map for a better accuracy or a better privacy.</p>

<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>We already have the hardware production ready for the three models but it is always possible to encounter delays when dealing with a new gadget production, especially one that is so complex, having a hardware and the software component involved. And then, the project can be delayed by situations that do not depend on us, like the manufacturing of the components from different suppliers. Bosch’s VOC sensors that are used in uRADMonitor Model Ds, are advertised to be available in 2016 Q1, yet there isn’t an exact timeframe.</p>
<p>Whatever the situation we promise to communicate you the status.</p>
<p>The model A and the KIT1 are mature, and have passed the test of time in terms of reliability. Production plan for these two is complete, and we can start delivery soon.</p>

Model D is new, and there is ongoing development on the software side, but that follows a predictable pattern. 
The only difficult challenge remains in making the project known, and spreading the network for increased resolution. And here you can help! Either by supporting this project and getting a detector, either by sharing it among your friends. Both count equally and we are greatful.
Our struggle doesn't end here: we're constantly involved in active research on better sensors and more hardware units. We've built a platform, and adding more sensors is the natural way to go, to include water quality.
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1447339400/o8mbv2nxpkgtmrubwvfs.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
A considerable amount of money will be spent on getting all required certifications and unit metrology tests in speciliased laboratories.
The future plans also include wearables, adding pollution trackers to devices increasingly smaller. With your help, we will get there! <div>

</div></div>","What is uRADMonitor?uRADMonitor is a project that addresses pollution, the kind that we are unable to see, but directly affects our health and can cause life threatening diseases. To help fight pollution, we have designed several fixed and mobile detectors, packed with powerful sensors, capable of detecting both the chemical and the physical harmful factors. All data goes online to a global network, so anyone can access it freely, at any time.


What type of pollutants are uRADMonitor devices able to detect?
uRADMonitor devices are able to detected a wide variety of pollutants, like: alpha, beta, gamma and x-ray radiation, an extended range of volatile organic compounds, the dangerous - potentially lethal gasses like Carbon Monoxide, Carbon Dioxide, particulate matter suspended in air, many of which are hazardous, like: dust, pollen, soot, smoke, or any liquid droplets, as well as barometric pressure, temperature and humidity.
By acquiring a device, you will not only benefit personally from its readings, securing your health, but you will also contribute to building the global pollution map, increasing people’s awareness on this issue.


 
uRADMonitor models description
We took several hardware designs from prototyping to production in record time. Choose the variant that suits you best, all are excellent detectors.
 
uRADMonitor Model D


The first portable unit in the series, this model opens a new direction with additional sensors focused on air quality and pollution.
It can measure temperature, barometric pressure, humidity, dust concentration, pollen, smoke, soot, VOC (volatile organic compounds) and also alpha, beta, gamma and x-ray radiation.
It has a large color LCD with a touchscreen and can connect to WiFi networks to  gain Internet access and synchronize all measurements with the central server. 
The internal alarm is used for audible warnings for elevated readings, dangerous for our health. These notifications can also be transmitted automatically via email or sms.

How are the readings visualised?
uRADMonitor is the first global surveillance monitoring network created to track pollution. Readings can be viewed instantly on the models that have a display: model D and KIT1. Measurements are centralised automatically, and online data allows us to build graphs, stats and send automated notifications when certain thresholds are reached.   The web portal can be accessed on www.uradmonitor.com  by anyone, at anytime, for free. The project started back in 2013 and the number of worldwide users has already reached 300.  This infrastructure is an amazing piece of technology, handling big data loads in real time.  With a click, you see the entire world mapped in colours, hopefully as green as possible!






What makes uRADMonitor unique?
uRADMonitor is the first global network created to track pollution, in order to increase awareness and secure health. It already reached 300 users with Model A for over a year, proving its quality and reliability.uRADMonitor Model D advantages:• it is the first to use the newest and most reliable VOC sensor, that will only be available from next year. Similar handheld devices, using VOC sensors, available on the market, have very little life span and poor stability. This is probably the reason why no pollution large scale maps were available up to now.
 • it has a larger number of sensors compared with most pollution detectors on the market, therefore it's more sensitive and able to measure multiple parameters affecting the air quality. 
 • it has the best price on the market considering the many sensors and its incredible features.• an easy to use UI
 • it is a complex gadget, equipped with a wide range of high quality expensive sensors, a colour display, wireless module and a rechargeable battery, making it an independent device (with no additional software required nor any smartphones to do its job). This is a professional device, with an expensive production chain but that's what you get so don't settle for anything less. 
We're also trying to fit any budget, this is why the project allows joining with a multitude of detectors. Our next goal is to build 2 simpler, smaller, lightweight and affordable  but still high quality, VOC and radiation detector models, in the near future, addressing them primarily to bicyclists and joggers and all people interested and supporting a cleaner environment. We're making it happen!


 

The uRADMonitor devices come with some amazing features:



Frequently asked questions
How do uRADMonior devices work?
uRADMonior devices are packed with powerful sensors, capable of detecting both the chemical and the physical harmful factors, that can impact our lifespan and cause life threatening diseases. Readings can be viewed instantly on the devices that have a display. All readings are centralised automatically on www.uradmonitor.com. Online data allows us to build graphs, stats and send automated notifications when certain thresholds are reached.
Who can benefit from these devices? Why should I get one?
Anyone, with or without a device can benefit from this project. The www.uradmonitor.com is available for free, offering valuable uncensored pollution statistics and graphs, around the world. If you want to get specific information on your own location you can purchase a device and by doing so you get to contribute to the entire network as well.Every day synthetic, toxic chemicals are released into the environment. The air is what we breathe; what travels through the air is what we inhale. As it ultimately affects the future of our planet and us, it is considered to be a global threat at huge cost to the environment.People with allergies, asthma, lung cancer or other respiratory diseases can benefit the most from these devices, as their health state might not give them the option to ignore excessive dust, pollen, high concentration of toxic chemicals or highly polluted traffic areas. Knowing the facts might be a life saver for people that are already ill and a good preventer for us all.
What is radiation?
Radiation may be defined as energy traveling through space. Non-ionizing radiation, like:microwaves, lasers, radio waves, infrared light, radar or ultraviolet light is essential to life, but excessive exposures will cause tissue damage, whereas all forms of ionizing radiation, like: the cosmic radiation that passes the atmosphere, x-ray used for screenings or the decay of radioactive isotopes especially found near uranium mines and nuclear plants, can cause damage to living tissue, and can result in mutation, radiation sickness, cancer, and death.
Radiation sources are found in a wide range of occupational settings like: airline crew (the most exposed population), industrial radiography, medical radiology and nuclear medicine, uranium mining , nuclear power plant, research laboratories. Massive particles are a concern for astronauts outside the earth's magnetic field who would receive solar particles from solar proton events (SPE) and galactic cosmic rays from cosmic sources.
The public also is exposed to radiation from consumer products, such as tobacco (polonium-210), combustible fuels (gas, coal, etc.), televisions, luminous watches and dials (tritium), airport X-ray systems, smoke detectors (americium), electron tubes, and gas lantern mantles (thorium). Air travel exposes people on aircraft to increased radiation from space up to 40 times more compared to the ground level.
How can radiation affect my health?
If radiation is not properly controlled it can be potentially hazardous to the health. Ionizing radiation — the kind that minerals, atom bombs and nuclear reactors emit — does one main thing to the human body: it weakens and breaks up DNA, either damaging cells enough to kill them or causing them to mutate in ways that may eventually lead to cancer.
What are VOCs?
Volatile organic compounds, sometimes referred to as VOCs, are chemicals that easily become vapours or gases, that contain carbon and are found in all living things. Along with carbon, they contain elements such as hydrogen, oxygen, fluorine, chlorine, bromine, sulfur or nitrogen.
Volatile organic compounds are released from burning fuel, such as gasoline, wood, coal, or natural gas. They are also emitted from oil and gas fields and diesel exhaust. Other sources include: solvents, paints, glues, and other products some of which can be used or stored at home and at work.
Many volatile organic compounds are also hazardous air pollutants. Volatile organic compounds, when combined with nitrogen oxides, react to form ground-level ozone, or smog, which can contribute to climate change.
Examples of volatile organic compounds are gasoline, benzene, formaldehyde, solvents such as toluene and xylene, styrene, and perchloroethylene, the main solvent used in dry cleaning.
Many volatile organic compounds are commonly used in paint thinners, lacquer thinners, moth repellents, air fresheners, hobby supplies, wood preservatives, aerosol sprays, degreasers, automotive products, and dry cleaning fluids.
How might I be exposed to volatile organic compounds?
Volatile organic compounds are common air pollutants found in most of the air. You can be exposed to volatile organic compounds outdoors by breathing polluted air that contains them. You are most likely to be exposed to volatile organic compounds outdoors in the summer, when the sun and hot temperatures react with pollution or during the foggy winter days,to form smog, causing various respiratory health diseases.
Indoors, products that contain volatile organic compounds release emissions when you use them, and to a smaller degree, when they are stored. You can be exposed to volatile organic compounds at home when you are cooking like grilling and frying or  when you use cleaning, painting, or hobby supplies products that contain VOCs. You can also be exposed if you dry clean your clothes with home dry-cleaning products; if you dry-clean your clothes at a professional dry-cleaner; or if you use graphics and crafts materials such as glues, permanent markers, and photographic solutions.
At work, you can be exposed to volatile organic compounds if involved with dry cleaning, in a photography studio, or an office that uses copiers, printers, or correction fluids. You can also be exposed if you work in chemical manufacturing or with petroleum-based products.
How can volatile organic compounds affect my health?
The health effects of volatile organic compounds can vary greatly according to the compound, which can range from being highly toxic to having no known health effects. The health effects of volatile organic compounds will depend on the nature of the volatile organic compound, the level of exposure, and the length of exposure.
According to the Thirteenth Report on Carcinogens published by the National Toxicology Program, benzene and formaldehyde are human carcinogens; perchloroethylene and styrene are ""reasonably anticipated to be human carcinogens."" People at the highest risk of long-term exposure to these three volatile organic compounds are industrial workers who have prolonged exposure to the compounds used at the workplace; cigarette smokers; and people who have prolonged exposure to emissions from heavy motor vehicle traffic.
Long-term exposure to volatile organic compounds can cause damage to the liver, kidneys, and central nervous system. Short-term exposure to volatile organic compounds can cause eye and respiratory tract irritation, headaches, dizziness, visual disorders, fatigue, loss of coordination, allergic skin reactions, nausea, and memory impairment.
How does dust affect my health?
Very small particles can be deeply respired into the lungs and remain there. 
These type of particles, small enough to be inhaled may cause: irritation of the eyes, coughing, sneezing, hayfever or asthma attacks.
Other dust-related, human-health concerns include airborne transmission of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, and fungus) and the compositions of certain hazardous dust particles.
Some minerals in dust are extremely hazardous, such as certain asbestiform minerals or silica because of their ability to lodge in lung tissue and promote disease such as lung cancer. Other minerals may contain potentially toxic elements, such as certain heavy metals.
Does the device detect pollen?
uRADMonitor Model D, does not have a specific pollen detector, but pollen particles would be detected just like other particulate matter.
How does CO affect my health?
Carbon monoxide, or CO, is a toxic gas that you cannot see or smell. CO is given off whenever fuel or other carbon-based materials are burned with insufficient air.
Breathing CO can cause headache, dizziness, vomiting, and nausea. If CO levels are high enough, you may become unconscious or die. Exposure to moderate and high levels of CO over long periods of time has also been linked with increased risk of heart disease. People who survive severe CO poisoning may suffer long-term health problems.
Scientists are not sure what the health effects are when a person is exposed to low levels of CO over a long period of time. Better tracking of CO poisoning and exposure can help us learn about the effects of long-term exposures to low levels of CO.
How does knowing all the pollutants I’m being exposed to, get to help me?
""Like in many other mornings, my wife was preparing the breakfast, she was making toast for the breakfast. I’ve made some tests with uRADMonitor Model D an evening before, and the device was still running in the kitchen. I instantly received a notification on my phone with VOCs being on dangerous levels. At first I thought it could not be all of the sudden and it must be a false alarm, since the device was in its beta testing days, but then I realised it was actually the toast producing all the harmful gasses. We stopped this harmful habit right away!
One morning we took a ride through the city to test the air quality with the newly mounted experimental setup. We gathered data from almost 2 hours of driving, even passing a few times through the same place. As you can see in the video, data was automatically sent and displayed on the mobile, although without a map it was hard to appreciate the readings on site. Once we arrived home I’ve mapped all readings and I was surprised so see that on one of the streets the radiation levels were gradually increasing as we approached a location and then they were gradually decreasing as we were driving away from that place, meaning there was some kind of radioactive source in there. It might have been the basalt or granite used for construction which can contain uranium or some kind of radioactive waste and I'm tempted to dig more on this problem.
In some of the days, especially when the temperatures dropped we were more tempted to skip house ventilation too often so VOCs levels, especially from cooking and use of certain housekeeping products were increasing high enough to receive an alert on phone. This worked as a great reminder to ventilate our home!""  said Radu Motisan
These are just a few of the situations we’ve faced since testing uRADMonitor, but normally we might have never guessed what's there. So the answer is definitely, YES! There are actions we can take in certain situations, to minimise air pollution around us, instantly.
Did you know?
Indoor air quality can be up to 10 times worse than outdoor?
Some of the most dangerous VOCs are CO, formaldehyde and benzene and the last two are found in diesel emissions?
Sooty, smelly diesel exhaust is more than just unpleasant -- it's a mix of more than 40 toxic air contaminants and has been linked to cancer, asthma and more than 21,000 premature deaths across USA every year. Many Americans live and work near diesel hotspots such as truck depots, bus terminals, ports, construction sites and busy roads and highways. Some studies have shown that kids riding inside diesel school buses can be exposed to higher levels of unhealthy diesel soot than people riding in nearby cars.
Formaldehyde is a cancer-causing chemical used for a number of purposes, including the manufacture of insulation, pesticides and disinfectants. But most industrial emissions of formaldehyde -- 42 percent -- are from the lumber industry, which uses adhesives containing formaldehyde to make plywood. Formaldehyde has been linked to lung cancer, and may also cause leukemia and asthma attacks. Diesel emissions also contribute to formaldehyde pollution.
To minimize formaldehyde exposures at home, make sure any wood furniture or fixtures that use particleboard are laminated or otherwise coated, choose exterior- rather than interior-grade pressed wood products for remodelling and be sure that areas where you are using products containing formaldehyde are well ventilated.
Used in motor fuels, solvents, detergents, pesticides and many other substances, benzene is a carcinogen that causes leukemia as well as a number of other illnesses. Virtually the entire U.S. population is exposed to benzene in at least small amounts -- at gas stations (it's in the gasoline), in diesel exhaust or from cigarette smoke, including second-hand smoke. Benzene also a problem in a number of workplaces, including oil refineries, coal-coking operations at steel mills, chemical processing plants, rubber manufacturing plants and laboratories, where it is often used as a solvent for other chemicals. You can avoid one significant source of benzene by stepping away from the gas pump when refuelling your car.
When you inhale microscopic bits of particulate matter -- otherwise known as soot -- fine particles can become embedded in your lungs and impair their function?
As many as 64,000 premature deaths occur each year from cardiopulmonary causes attributable to particulate air pollution. Most particulate emissions result from burning fossil fuels -- coal, oil, diesel, gasoline -- or wood. Old coal-fired power plants, industrial boilers, diesel and gas-powered vehicles and wood stoves are some of the worst culprits. High-temperature industrial processes such as metal smelting and steel production are also significant sources.
Everyone can help cut down on particulate matter pollution by conserving energy and choosing cleaner, more efficient energy sources for home heating and cooling, transportation, and appliances. Certainly, limiting your use of wood-burning fireplaces and stoves is a good start.
Exposure to radon is estimated to be the second leading cause of lung cancer?
It accounts for an estimated 21,000 lung cancer deaths each year (range of 8,000 to 45,000). Radon is a tasteless, colourless and odorless gas that is produced by decaying uranium and occurs naturally in soil and rock. The majority of these deaths occur among smokers since there is a greater risk for lung cancer when smokers also are exposed to radon.

The making of






















A global success in one year

Packed with powerful sensors, capable of detecting both the chemical and the physical harmful factors, uRADMonitor is an example of a complex piece of technology driven by motivation to help people solve the pollution problem. And it's not just about your neighborhood or city, it goes way up to global scale.
The project is the result of considerable research on electronics, sensor physics and software, spreading on more than two years. uRADMonitor has received international recognition, taking the grand prize on Arad Innovation Fair and being a finalist in two categories on the prestigious Hackaday Prize competition.

Why crowdfunding?
uRADMonitor is a project that started from passion and personal need of its creator of acquiring uncensored, real time pollution information. Radu Motisan updated his progress on his personal blog: www.pocketmagic.net with his weekly entries . Many of his visitors became interested in this project contributing with ideas. Soon what started as a hobby transformed into a product that further developed as a community project. This is why uRADMonitor needs your support! We believe that by bringing uRADMonitor project to a higher scale, we can accomplish our goal of increasing awareness on pollution dangers, consequently helping us all fight against its factors.
By contributing to this project you will get involved in this great mission along with other people that believe in our work and share our vision.




Frequently asked questions

Where  are the devices shipped from?
uRADMonitor is made by a company registered in the EU. But, to reduce costs, production is made in China. Therefore all devices will be shipped from China.  The customers have the responsibility of paying any customs charges, including VAT. 

Do I need a mobile or do I have to download a software, for these devices to work?
No. All models have been designed to work as standalone devices. No mobile or other software required.
Will I receive notifications/allerts when threshold are reached?
Yes, you will get immediate specific notifications.
Do they work indoor and outdoor?
uRADMonitor Model D is a portable device, you can take it with you wherever you are.
Although Model A is a fixed dosimeter and does not have a display, you can take it with you anywhere you have internet access, all readings will be visible on www.uradmonitor.com
KIT1 can be used both as a fixed monitoring station or a mobile unit.
How do the devices communicate with the server?
Model D has a built in wifi module to connect to the internet wirelessly. Model A and Model KIT1 use an ethernet connection by cable to your internet router. Everything is plug and play. The devices simply get an IP via DHCP and they are ready to talk to the server.
How long does the battery last?
uRADMonitor D currently has a high capacity 1500mAh lithium battery which can support normal system functions for as long as 12 hours of use.



Are the devices waterproof?
Although we’ve designed the models so that all sensors are minimally exposed to elements, these devices are measuring the air quality, so a good air flow is necessary. You should avoid water getting into your Model D unit! Model A is a fixed dosimeter that can be mounted outside as it's rainproofed when installed vertically with cables down. KIT1 depends on your own enclosing solution.
What is the operating temperature?
Model A has been successfully tested to function properly in a -25° C +65° C.
Who can see the readings from my device?
All data is open source, so the idea is to share all readings on the portal unless you opt-out. Additionally you can configure the location displayed on the map for a better accuracy or a better privacy.

Risks and challenges
We already have the hardware production ready for the three models but it is always possible to encounter delays when dealing with a new gadget production, especially one that is so complex, having a hardware and the software component involved. And then, the project can be delayed by situations that do not depend on us, like the manufacturing of the components from different suppliers. Bosch’s VOC sensors that are used in uRADMonitor Model Ds, are advertised to be available in 2016 Q1, yet there isn’t an exact timeframe.
Whatever the situation we promise to communicate you the status.
The model A and the KIT1 are mature, and have passed the test of time in terms of reliability. Production plan for these two is complete, and we can start delivery soon.








Model D is new, and there is ongoing development on the software side, but that follows a predictable pattern. 
The only difficult challenge remains in making the project known, and spreading the network for increased resolution. And here you can help! Either by supporting this project and getting a detector, either by sharing it among your friends. Both count equally and we are greatful.
Our struggle doesn't end here: we're constantly involved in active research on better sensors and more hardware units. We've built a platform, and adding more sensors is the natural way to go, to include water quality.

A considerable amount of money will be spent on getting all required certifications and unit metrology tests in speciliased laboratories.
The future plans also include wearables, adding pollution trackers to devices increasingly smaller. With your help, we will get there! 


 
Get a unit, and join the network!
We've come a long way getting the project were it is today. It works and it does a great job, but we need your help to speed up the development and increase the coverage. 
It's very simple. Get a unit, and join the network. You get a dosimeter to monitor the quality of your environment 24/7, but you also support the work, and research, invested in this community project, helping it move forward.
The impact is huge. With each new unit, the project makes a step forward in its mission of delivering uncensored environmental readings worldwide!

</div></div>","Short Summary of our Recovery Group



Secular Recovery (Ottawa) is run by a group of volunteers with a variety of backgrounds and experience in the field of addictions, psychology, and science. 
The goal of our campaign is to raise funds in order to provide safe space for secular support groups and those who struggle with addictions. Peer-support groups for those with substance control issues are absolutely critical to begin and maintain recovery,  

For over 70 years the predominant North American model for addiction support has been the 12-step program - Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), Narcotics Anonymous (NA), CA etc. This program is rooted in faith - the belief that handing over our problems to a ""Higher Power"" (called Him, or God in the 12-steps) will cure an individual's alcohol and/or drug problems.  

We know it is important for there to be more options out there for those who have trouble connecting with 12-step programs. 

Contributing to our cause will help our organization grow and expand to a wider audience, saving lives along the way.

  What Secular Recovery Ottawa Needs & What Your Donations Support
Our goal is to raise $3000. This will go towards various aspects of our peer- support group that will aid in making it a larger, more knowledgeable, and more effective program. Specifically, funds will contribute to:


Room rentals that will house our support groups - we hope to open a second weekly meeting in Ottawa. Also in the near future, we hope to expand outside of Ottawa into other areas of Canada and beyond, and we have already started building a group in Montreal. 

We need to build our lending library to make the most recent scientific literature in the study of addiction and recovery available for clients to borrow.

recovery and before that, whilst in the pit of despair, I have taken 
comfort in just seeing the emails you send. Even if I didn't open them 
some times, just seeing that you cared enough to keep me on that email 
list meant a lot, just seeing the emails was a reminder that I needed to 
get help.""
  Risks & Challenges
Secular Recovery Ottawa has overcome one of its first major hurdles in that we have managed to maintain a presence and grow in the last year. It is very difficult to get the message out that we are here amidst the still-prevalent view that one must go to AA or NA (12-step programs) to get sober. With greater funding we can reach out to help more people become aware that we are here through advertising and having promotions on our website (http://www.secular-recovery.org/), reaching more people through our Facebook page (https://www.facebook.com/secular.recovery.ottawa), through webpages such as (http://www.meetup.com/Secular-Recovery-Ottawa/) and even word of mouth by distributing business cards, pamphlets and books at more than one local meeting per week. 

  Other Ways You Can Help
You can ask to volunteer. We have a number of volunteer positions available that you can access on our website. Some of these positions do not need you to be physically in Ottawa and it is possible to telecommute. Tell anyone who may be interested that we are here in Ottawa, hoping to expand, and hoping to help more of those individuals who struggle with substance use.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3> <p></p>
<p>Trail Head Racing, from San Jose, California has become a successful and
well recognized team in only two short years. Now it is time to take it to the
next level! Four of our riders will be traveling the United States and Canada
to gain National recognition, series titles, and wins. We cannot do it without
your help! <span>We
don't expect to handed a free season, and are more than willing to put in as
much work as it takes to complete our goals. With all of our riders on the
national division of THR being in school, funding is one of the largest
obstacle we have to overcome. A 2014 ProGRT season would have cost nearly $4000
in gas, and that doesn't include food and hotels for any of it. With this
vehicle we are trying to cut hotel costs all together, be able to transport
everyone in a single vehicle, and provide media coverage of all the events and
races we attend. Another goal we have is to host more speed traps at races to
help raise money for A Little 4 A Lot, and this large truck will help immensely
with transporting the equipment needed to do this. This isn't aimed at the
average person, rather companies trying to increase their presence in the
racing scene, although we are more than happy to accept help from anyone and
would like to help them in return. Being able to have a small portable bike
shop at races, we can help other riders with maintenance at the races which are
sometimes far from a bike shop. Another way of giving back would be media
coverage of other up and coming riders, of companies who support the racers
that dedicate their time to racing, and of the organizations such as the
California Enduro Series that put on these great races. We would be glad to
hear other suggestions on how we can give back to the racing and riding
community so please, let us know.</span></p>

</h3>
<p>Plainly speaking, we found that the original backers of the 1Hour Break® Indiegogo campaign were so fanatical (in a good way) about the campaign that they ended up becoming our most important group of brand ambassadors. Ultimately, when the campaign ended we had an overwhelming number of people expressing interest in 1Hour Break® and asking how they could still take advantage of the deeply discounted Indiegogo price. Until now, there was no other option for them, except to wait for 1Hour Break® to be available at retail.</p>
<p>With Indiegogo's Forever Funding Platform, InDemand, we're able to continue with the momentum of the campaign and offer continued discounted pricing on 1Hour Break® V2.0 to those who weren't able to hop in on the first wave.</p>
<p>For us it's more about the opportunity to help others redefine how the world handles stress and anxiety at a price point that won't break the bank.</p>

Build and strength cellular structure
Reduce atopic dermatitis

<p><span>Health care costs are a big deal and they are out of control. More government control and regulation is not the answer. We have the answer and you can be the solution.                 Healthcare and Wealthcare for Life.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>We have created an alternative to The Affordable Care Act or ObamaScare as we call it.</strong> Instead of of more government involvement and restrictions we offer more freedom, choice, and open access to treatments, providers and modalities. We believe that each individual has the unalienable rights to choose what they want, the kind of treatment and providers they want to use, not some organization, committee, government, or another person. Imagine being a part of this opportunity to help.</span></p>
<p><span>Now we want to share this with everyone that wants to save money, reduce costs, have more freedom, greater choices, and more options. We need your help to complete our dynamic website, and to spread the word to every freedom loving citizen of this great country. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hi I’m Tim Vest Founder of Active LifeSystems, a new innovative approach to healthcare.</p>
<p><span>I have worked in the healthcare, health insurance, and securities industry for over 38 years. I have personally created, and managed three very successful different self funded health plans for small businesses nationwide.</span></p>
<p><span>With a very experienced team of experts in medicine, healthcare, finance, insurance, marketing, ecommerce, alternative health modalities, diet, nutrition, and nutritional supplement formulation,  we have created an alternative health plan to health insurance and <strong>ObamaScare</strong>.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>WHAT IT IS ALL ABOUT</strong></p>
<p><span>Our Active Choice Health Plan is not health insurance, but a Non Profit charitable, educational and consumer co op. It is a member owned community to help each other provide health care and cover each other the way health insurance was meant to.</span></p>
<p><span>We cover all pre existing conditions, cover you world wide, allow you the freedom to choose the type of treatment, care, and providers you want,  traditional or holistic alternatives.</span></p>
<p><span>We believe that rather than having more government control and restrictions on what kind of treatments and providers you can go to or use, and how much care you can get.  Imagine how you would feel with</span> more freedom and control, the freedom to choose who you want to go to and what kinds of treatment you want to receive, feel comfortable with and believe in.</p>
<p><span>We cover all modalities, traditional care and providers, as well as alternative holistic providers and treatments. How would you like the freedom and access to choose the type of provider you want to see including naturopaths, homeopaths, or an MD. You also have the freedom to choose the type of treatment you want including holistic alternatives. We give you the power to have the control, and responsibility over your health and well being. Not some government agency or appointed committee.</span></p>
<p><span>We believe that each individual has the right,  privilege, and freedom to choose what they feel is the best care, treatment, and provider for them.</span></p>
<p><span>We also encourage individuals to seek the best care anywhere in the US or the World. That is why we offer worldwide coverage. Wouldn't it feel great to be able to find and use the best modalities anywhere in the world when it comes to your health, mind, and body.</span></p>
<p><span>The reason our health plan is non profit charitable and educational cooperative is so that we can build a community that is focused on helping each other rather than trying to make as much money as possible and making sure our stockholders are getting the highest returns possible. We offer an education, consumer based plan that puts you in charge of your future health and happiness that gives you control over your life, your health care and allows you the freedom to choose where and how you spend your healthcare dollars. Because our program is Non Profit, if you don’t need your healthcare plan for a catastrophic event during the year  you will actually get money back tax free.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>WHAT YOUR CONTRIBUTION WILL DO</strong> </p>
<p><span>The money we are raising is to help us complete a dynamic interactive website for members and providers to interact with a very extensive knowledge base to bring together the best health care information, options, treatments, modalities, and knowledge so that you can find what you need to keep you and your family healthy, happy, and strong.Can you imagine how great you would feel to be a part of this great community. We are also seeking out the best and greatest providers, practitioners, and healers from all over the world and creating links to them and you, so that you can choose who you want to go to and the treatment that you want to receive.</span></p>
<p><span>We are also seeking contributions for our national marketing campaign. We want to take our program to and reach as many people as possible. We want to share this with everyone that wants save money, reduce costs, have more freedom, greater choice, more opportunities, and to take responsibility for their health and wellbeing. How would you feel to know that  you were able to help bring this type of a program to everyone in the country. Everyone deserves freedom and choice. </span></p>
<p>  </p>
<p><span>Over the past two years we have been proving and perfecting The Active Choice Health Plan to make sure that everyone can use our resources and save money on their health care costs and treatments.  We have been able to save as much as 50 to 70% off of medical expenses and care by teaching our members to be consumers and shop for services and by using holistic alternatives.</span></p>
<p><span>Just imagine what you could do with a 50% savings off of your current health insurance costs. It does not have to cost that much. With more freedom and greater choice also comes more responsibility, however </span>with more responsibility comes greater savings and with greater savings comes more discretionary income for you to use for yourself or your family. The quickest and easiest way to give yourself a raise is by lowering your health care costs and expenses.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>With your contributions we will be able to help educate, cover, and teach 1000’s if not millions of people how to be healthier, happier, be more prosperous and productive. We want to offer them  the freedom, choice, and power to control their own health and wellbeing. We want to help open people’s minds and provide them with the knowledge and power to make educated decisions on their health care and give them the control of their own health and finances. We want to help give them more options in health care that they have not had before. We want everyone to have freedom of choice, not have choice taken from them and dictated who they can see, what treatments they get, and how they want to be taken care of by a committee of  strangers telling them what they can or can’t do.</span></p>

Health care costs are a big deal and they are out of control. More government control and regulation is not the answer. We have the answer and you can be the solution.                 Healthcare and Wealthcare for Life.
We have created an alternative to The Affordable Care Act or ObamaScare as we call it. Instead of of more government involvement and restrictions we offer more freedom, choice, and open access to treatments, providers and modalities. We believe that each individual has the unalienable rights to choose what they want, the kind of treatment and providers they want to use, not some organization, committee, government, or another person. Imagine being a part of this opportunity to help.
Now we want to share this with everyone that wants to save money, reduce costs, have more freedom, greater choices, and more options. We need your help to complete our dynamic website, and to spread the word to every freedom loving citizen of this great country. 
 
Hi I’m Tim Vest Founder of Active LifeSystems, a new innovative approach to healthcare.
I have worked in the healthcare, health insurance, and securities industry for over 38 years. I have personally created, and managed three very successful different self funded health plans for small businesses nationwide.
With a very experienced team of experts in medicine, healthcare, finance, insurance, marketing, ecommerce, alternative health modalities, diet, nutrition, and nutritional supplement formulation,  we have created an alternative health plan to health insurance and ObamaScare.
 
WHAT IT IS ALL ABOUT
Our Active Choice Health Plan is not health insurance, but a Non Profit charitable, educational and consumer co op. It is a member owned community to help each other provide health care and cover each other the way health insurance was meant to.
We cover all pre existing conditions, cover you world wide, allow you the freedom to choose the type of treatment, care, and providers you want,  traditional or holistic alternatives.
We believe that rather than having more government control and restrictions on what kind of treatments and providers you can go to or use, and how much care you can get.  Imagine how you would feel with more freedom and control, the freedom to choose who you want to go to and what kinds of treatment you want to receive, feel comfortable with and believe in.
We cover all modalities, traditional care and providers, as well as alternative holistic providers and treatments. How would you like the freedom and access to choose the type of provider you want to see including naturopaths, homeopaths, or an MD. You also have the freedom to choose the type of treatment you want including holistic alternatives. We give you the power to have the control, and responsibility over your health and well being. Not some government agency or appointed committee.
We believe that each individual has the right,  privilege, and freedom to choose what they feel is the best care, treatment, and provider for them.
We also encourage individuals to seek the best care anywhere in the US or the World. That is why we offer worldwide coverage. Wouldn't it feel great to be able to find and use the best modalities anywhere in the world when it comes to your health, mind, and body.
The reason our health plan is non profit charitable and educational cooperative is so that we can build a community that is focused on helping each other rather than trying to make as much money as possible and making sure our stockholders are getting the highest returns possible. We offer an education, consumer based plan that puts you in charge of your future health and happiness that gives you control over your life, your health care and allows you the freedom to choose where and how you spend your healthcare dollars. Because our program is Non Profit, if you don’t need your healthcare plan for a catastrophic event during the year  you will actually get money back tax free.
 
WHAT YOUR CONTRIBUTION WILL DO 
The money we are raising is to help us complete a dynamic interactive website for members and providers to interact with a very extensive knowledge base to bring together the best health care information, options, treatments, modalities, and knowledge so that you can find what you need to keep you and your family healthy, happy, and strong.Can you imagine how great you would feel to be a part of this great community. We are also seeking out the best and greatest providers, practitioners, and healers from all over the world and creating links to them and you, so that you can choose who you want to go to and the treatment that you want to receive.
We are also seeking contributions for our national marketing campaign. We want to take our program to and reach as many people as possible. We want to share this with everyone that wants save money, reduce costs, have more freedom, greater choice, more opportunities, and to take responsibility for their health and wellbeing. How would you feel to know that  you were able to help bring this type of a program to everyone in the country. Everyone deserves freedom and choice. 
  
Over the past two years we have been proving and perfecting The Active Choice Health Plan to make sure that everyone can use our resources and save money on their health care costs and treatments.  We have been able to save as much as 50 to 70% off of medical expenses and care by teaching our members to be consumers and shop for services and by using holistic alternatives.
Just imagine what you could do with a 50% savings off of your current health insurance costs. It does not have to cost that much. With more freedom and greater choice also comes more responsibility, however with more responsibility comes greater savings and with greater savings comes more discretionary income for you to use for yourself or your family. The quickest and easiest way to give yourself a raise is by lowering your health care costs and expenses.
 
With your contributions we will be able to help educate, cover, and teach 1000’s if not millions of people how to be healthier, happier, be more prosperous and productive. We want to offer them  the freedom, choice, and power to control their own health and wellbeing. We want to help open people’s minds and provide them with the knowledge and power to make educated decisions on their health care and give them the control of their own health and finances. We want to help give them more options in health care that they have not had before. We want everyone to have freedom of choice, not have choice taken from them and dictated who they can see, what treatments they get, and how they want to be taken care of by a committee of  strangers telling them what they can or can’t do.
  
We want to help as many people as possible reach health and financial freedom. By joining our community you can help us reach thousands, tens of thousands or even millions of people that want to save money, be healthier, happier, be more prosperous, productive, and have more freedom, more choices, more options and control over their healthcare.

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>I have grown up around race tracks and have always had a passion for cars and going fast. But it wasn't until I was 16 that I finally started racing karts. From that point on there was no turning back. </p>
<p>I have been racing karts and cars now for a total of 7 years and have gotten the chance to drive some great machines. From 125cc shifter karts to 400 horsepower Mustangs I have a wide range of experience.</p>
<p>I am now trying to take my career down a new path, the path of vintage racing. My dad used to vintage race and now I want to fulfill my dream of racing at The Walter Mitty Challenge at Road Atlanta. This race is a landmark in the southeast for vintage racing and my Mustang fits into the vintage category now. </p>
<p>This race will not only help me fulfill a dream but will also put me on a personal level with men and women that have the ability of furthering my career into the professional rankings of motorsports. </p>

<p>The lead safe play area campaign can be stated in four sentences.  During the Twentieth century cities became contaminated by millions of tons of lead used in consumer products, especially paint and gasoline <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">additives</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">.  Young children are distressingly sensitive to lead dust and exposure causes multiple health outcomes including intellectual deficits and behavioral problems.  Gardens are being established in lead contaminated areas and children are being exposed to lead dust when they eat contaminated vegetables or play. Because communities are unsafe for children they are unsafe for everyone.  Our goal is to create lead safe areas for gardening and playing within contaminated neighborhoods of the city. </span></p>
<p><strong><em>Brief description of campaign importance:  </em></strong>As concerned citizens, parents, educators, and grandparents this project is vitally important to me and my partners at NolaUnleaded.  As a result of studies in the 1970’s I became aware that cities were lead contaminated as the result of the daily accumulation of lead dust, especially from vehicle traffic because gasoline contained lead additives.  My daughter became lead poisoned and after thorough investigation I discovered that she was playing in soil that was recognized as hazardous waste if it were on industrial properties. When the soil was changed her blood lead rapidly declined.  In the 1980’s I worked with a group of concerned citizens and the Minnesota State Legislature to ban the use of lead in gasoline. The rapid phase-down was accomplished through action by Congress and the EPA on January 1, 1986, the residue of the lead dust in urban environments has not being dealt with.   Further investigation revealed patterns of lead poisoning of children that were related to city size and location of residences within cities.  Children depend on the adult population to provide for their well-being.  The goal of this project is to create lead safe gardens and play areas within lead contaminated communities of New Orleans.</p>
<p><strong><em>What contributors will help achieve:  </em></strong>My team mapped the environmental lead in New Orleans and we have a good understanding of communities where the highest amounts of soil lead exist in the city.   The city and federal government are doing lead cleanup at public properties.  New Orleans city officials are taking measures to clean up parks.  The US Housing and Urban Development changes the environmental quality at public housing properties throughout the city of New Orleans.  The major gap is cleanup of private properties.  Contributions to this project go directly to reducing lead at gardens and play areas in New Orleans. The project works with garden programs to analyze vegetable garden soils and actively reduce soil lead. We also work with <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">properties that are not being handled by public sector actions such as </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">childcare centers and church properties.  Garden projects are springing up all over New Orleans. There are about 100 childcare centers that are located in high lead areas of the city.  To date we have changed the play environments at 25 childcare centers and 10 </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px;"">church property play areas</span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">. Changing the environment from lead hazardous to lead-safe gardens and play areas provides an essential condition for children’s well-being and assists with the prevention of the lifelong health problems that are associated with early exposure to lead.</span></p>
<p><strong><em>What We Need:  </em></strong>The lead safe soil project needs a modern handheld X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analyzer for rapidly testing the lead content of soils. With the XRF we can more efficiently identify gardens and play areas to prevent lead exposure of children.  You will have the satisfaction of knowing that contributions are being used to test and promote the quality of gardens and play areas where large numbers of children play.  Your contribution also generates action toward a model project that can be duplicated by other cities in the U.S.  The lead problem will not be controlled until the lead residues in gardens and children’s environments are dealt with.</p>
<p><strong><em>More detail:  </em></strong>The lead-safe project uses the soil lead map of New Orleans as a guide to select neighborhoods in the city that need attention.  The project obtains signed consent forms from property owners. Then the contractor comes in to measure the area, places a geotextile garden cloth on the surface of the contaminated soil, and brings in very low lead soil from outlying areas of the city.  Each project takes about 4 to 6 hours to accomplish.  Thus, within hours we change the soil from Pb contaminated with 500 to 1000 ppm to very clean less than 10 ppm. The clean soil provides a margin of safety to gardeners and children who use and play in the area.</p>
<p>As indicated by the lead map, there are numerous neighborhoods that need treatment.   The contributions will pay two people, Chris Gonzales and Eric Powell, who work together to locate childcare center and church properties and a local contractor, David Dapremont and crew, to haul low lead soil into high lead neighborhood properties and create lead-safe gardens and play areas within contaminated communities of New Orleans. We also have a CPA and Executive Director who assists with the project.  The project directs 100% of the contributed funds to support activities that test, treat and monitor the lead-safe garden and play area projects.  </p>
<p><strong><em>Lead Lab, Inc:</em></strong> is a not for profit 501(C) (3) corporation registered in Louisiana and all contributions are tax deductable to the fullest extent of the law.  We welcome any contribution amount.  As perks, we send out Mardi Gras beads and a Lead Safe Play Coloring books.  Also, New Orleans is America's #1 Favorite City, and we seek to make it a lead safer place to garden and play in.</p>
<p>All funds will be used toward the stated goals, namely developing lead-safe gardens and play areas on private properties.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Impact:  </em></strong>Children living in the inner city New Orleans exhibit many of the symptoms of lead poisoning:  They demonstrate serious educational failure, rampant behavioral problems, and display notoriously high rates of violence as young adults.  Education failure and violence are terribly expensive to the individuals, families and their communities.  Many costly chronic diseases are also associated with childhood lead exposure including, kidney and cardiovascular disease.   Reducing lead exposure by the youngest children should reduce the incidence of chronic diseases and improve community well-being in the future. </p>
<p><strong><em>The difference contributions will make:</em></strong>  This campaign will make it possible to continue with the on the ground improvements at play areas where large numbers of children play.  Without this service many children will continue to be exposed to their lead-contaminated play areas. </p>
<p><strong><em>Why the project is valuable to the world:  </em></strong>A successful play area lead prevention program in New Orleans would be a model program for other U.S. cities. For the U.S. to continue as a world leader it needs to promote primary lead prevention for the youngest generation of citizens. This project aims to promote environmental health for citizens by testing for contamination and appropriately changing the environment.</p>
<p><strong><em>Lead Lab, Inc. has a successful track record with lead contaminated soil intervention:</em></strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>Several successful pilot projects have demonstrated the feasibility and cost effectiveness for changing the environment at residential, and specifically, childcare and play properties in New Orleans.  Now we seek to extend the project to additional communities in the city.</li>
<li>NolaUnleaded is a partner organization of mothers who had children that were lead poisoned.  Nola Unleaded and Lead Lab, Inc. initiated a lead-safe project on 13 city parks which was carried out by the city in 2010-2013. </li>
</ul><p>The issues facing our children can be successfully resolved if adults work together to improve the quality of the environment. </p>
<p><strong><em>Some people just can’t contribute, but they can help:</em></strong>  So folks if you cannot contribute please help get the word out and make some noise about the lead safe play area campaign.    There are some excellent share tools available on Indiegogo!  Please pass this campaign on to your friends and neighbors.</p></div>","Short Summary: Gardens and Play areas are contaminated with toxic amounts of lead, but gardeners and children are unaware of this fact and still use these areas.  This project sets out to prevent children’s exposure to hazardous amounts of lead in their play areas.  My name is Howard W Mielke.  I live in New Orleans where I have been conducting studies on lead in the environment and children’s exposure for two decades.  I have an eclectic background that includes chemistry, biology and geography.  I received my PhD from the University of Michigan.  My career includes teaching at public universities (UCLA, University of Maryland Baltimore County) and private institutions (Macalester College, Xavier University of Louisiana College of Pharmacy) and currently I am a faculty member in the Department of Pharmacology, Tulane University School of Medicine.  My professional expertise is the study of poisons and especially the mapping of chemical environments of cities.

Several successful pilot projects have demonstrated the feasibility and cost effectiveness for changing the environment at residential, and specifically, childcare and play properties in New Orleans.  Now we seek to extend the project to additional communities in the city.
NolaUnleaded is a partner organization of mothers who had children that were lead poisoned.  Nola Unleaded and Lead Lab, Inc. initiated a lead-safe project on 13 city parks which was carried out by the city in 2010-2013. 
The issues facing our children can be successfully resolved if adults work together to improve the quality of the environment. 
Some people just can’t contribute, but they can help:  So folks if you cannot contribute please help get the word out and make some noise about the lead safe play area campaign.    There are some excellent share tools available on Indiegogo!  Please pass this campaign on to your friends and neighbors.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>Hello.  I am a 3 1/2 year survivor of breast cancer and a widow with a child still at home.  In 2008, I had to have a double masectomy and lymph nodes removed from both sides.  The next day, they had to do another lymph node dissection because they found cancer in the lymph nodes they removed.  No one had ever informed me about lymphedema risks and the fact that 35% of breast cancer patients get it to some degree. When the lymph nodes are removed due to breast cancer, fluid builds up in the affected area which for me is my arms, chest, ribs, underarms, and back.  I have severe lymphedema in my torso area and lighter lymphedema in my arms.  I have bought and tried many, many different compression garmets and devices but none work.  </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I lived in a large city before moving back to rural Louisiana where I grew up.  In the large cities, there are doctors that can manually drain the fluid that accumulates.  In rural America, not so much, in fact, not at all.  My insurance company has finally preauthorized the purchase and certified the medical necessity of the lymph jacket and pump.  Unfortunately, I my co-pay is quite expensive.  </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The medical supply company ordered the jacket and pump and dated the sale 12/30.  I do not have to actually give them the funds until Thursday when they deliver and customize it for me.  Keeping my fingers crossed...</p>

<p>This lymph jacket will be used by me several times a week for the rest of my life.  It will keep the fluid from accumulating in my torso which limits my daily life as well as the things I can do with my child.  The pain that occurs from the fluid accumulation is so bad that it becomes so overwhelming.  Driving for any distance longer than an hour and flying in a plane both cause the lymphedema to get worse so my travel is limited.   Constant pain changes who you are - something I learned from my late husband through all of his illness and disability after the Vietnam War.  I do not want to live with pain any longer and this device is a simple, though expensive, way to eliminate this pain and this problem.  It will allow me to live a normal life, just hook up to this machine for 30 minutes a day and I'll be good as new.  You can read info on this medical device at the URL below.   </p>

<p>Hi! My name is Nic Leggett, and with my mother Ann, I am starting <strong>+plus modern skin</strong>. Lots of people ask us ""Why do you want to start a skin care company?"" This is our answer.</p>
<p>10 years ago, Mom was diagnosed with breast cancer. We were freaked out and devastated, but Mom is the strongest person I know. She beat it. She often explains that one of the hardest parts of being diagnosed with cancer is this question: <strong>""Why did this happen to me?""</strong></p>
<p>The scary part is that there's an answer: exposure to household chemicals can contribute to cancer. This isn't just that noxious oven cleaner, or that smelly bathroom cleanser. It's your body wash, your soap, your lotion, your moisturizer. Some people are exposed to over 200 different harmful chemicals <strong>every day. </strong>That's terrifying.</p>
<p>So Mom threw literally every single product she owned in the garbage, and began the 10-year odyssey to find a better solution. She's tried nearly every product on the market - and couldn't find anything that worked.</p>
<p>The problem is this: conventional skin care products are somewhat effective, easy to buy and usually feel and smell pretty good. But they contain noxious and toxic chemicals. Natural skin care products are free of chemicals (well, sometimes - read your labels!), but they are often only obtainable at specialty health food stores, or they don't contain effective concentrations of the ingredients. And let's face it, they smell weird and feel weird. </p>
<p>So that's what we set out to do. We want to create beautiful products that are pure, powerful, free of chemicals and look really great on your bathroom counter.</p>
<p><strong>Beautiful, not toxic.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Natural, not boring.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pure, powerful, +plus.</strong></p>

Apple stem cell extracts cause your skin's stem cells to reproduce at a higher rate, literally turning back the time on your skin. <em>30mL / 1,0 oz. Retail price: $55. Indiegogo price: $44.</em></p>
<h3>+2.0 BODY MOISTURE</h3>

<h3>+3.0 LIP MOISTURE</h3>
<p>A refreshing and moisturizing ultra-mint lip balm with hints of rosemary to keep your lips hydrated even in the most extreme conditions. A bigger 0,25oz. tube means you're getting more for your money, too. <em>7mL / 0,25oz. Retail price: $15. Indiegogo price: $12.</em></p>

<p><strong>Tristian's Story</strong></p>
<p>Fifteen month old Tristian James has always been a happy go lucky little boy.  Always smiling, grooving, laughing, and bubbling with personality.  Then he began to stop placing weight on his left leg.  Although he wasn't walking yet he was always busy and cruising around the house, a force to be reckoned with.  Then he started to drag his left leg when he crawled and cried out in pain when he was picked up.  A trip to the emergency room and it was thought that he had an infection and would require surgery to relieve the pressure and swelling in his leg.  The nightmare began.</p>
<p>A day later and a dozen more tests and the first diagnosis came in.  A malignant tumor was found in his left femur.  Nineteen agonizing days after pathology and second opinions it was confirmed that Tristian has an extremely rare form of bone cancer, Ewings Sarcoma, literally unheard of in kids his age.  Two-thirds of his left femur is affected by the tumor.  He was started on chemo immediately to try to stop this aggressive cancer from spreading.  So far luck is on his side.</p>
<p><strong>Your Contribution</strong></p>
<p>Surgery is inevitable to remove the tumor and sooner than expected.  The hope is to salvage his leg if at all possible.  The surgery could be anywhere from Vancouver to further away into the United States.  There are no specialists in Saskatchewan to handle this delicate operation and so far no one within Canada who has seen this type of cancer in such a young child.</p>
<p>Your contribution will help cover the costs of travel, extra medical expenses like prescriptions and parking, and finally to help ease the loss of one full income in the household.  Someone must always be up at the hospital with Tristian as he is too young to leave by himself and neither of his parents want him to be alone.  Any contribution big or small will make a huge difference in this little boy's life.</p>
<p>Any funds that are raised over and above what will help these short term goals will be placed in trust for Tristian for any other medical expenses that may arise.  Should this battle with cancer be beaten back quickly any remaining funds will be held in trust for a college education for Tristian.</p>

<p>Tristian, thankfully, doesn't even realize that he is battling a life threatening condition and continues to be a beacon of light and happiness for those that are suffering alongside him.  Please donate to support this little boy and keep a smile on his face.</p>
<p>Thank you on behalf of Tristian and all of his family and friends for any contribution you can give, even if it's as simple as raising awareness for this fundraiser or Ewings Sarcoma itself.  We would also like to request that everyone out there take a moment to hug someone they care about, you never know when it might be your last chance.</p></div>","The Short

<p>I will be taking a nearly 50,000 mile road trip through the 50+ most populated cities in the United States, stopping at each to spend time attending major events (pro sports, concerts, etc.) and organizing creative fund raisers of my own, to try and meet my total trip collection of the $1,000,000.</p>
<p>To gain attention along the trip I will be traveling in a convoy of at least 3 vehicles (“The Cause Crew”). On these vehicles I will be selling advertisement space to help eliminate the expenses of the trip. The more ads I sell, the longer I can stay out on the road to collect more donations to help <em><span class=""caps"">FIGHT</span></em> <strong>Breast Cancer</strong>. <strong><em>Plus</em> the more space I fill with pictures of faces and colorful ads, <span class=""caps"">THE</span> <span class=""caps"">MORE</span> <span class=""caps"">AWESOME</span> <span class=""caps"">THESE</span> <span class=""caps"">CARS</span> <span class=""caps"">WILL</span> <span class=""caps"">LOOK</span>!</strong>.</p>
<p>I almost forgot! Funding the trip through IndieGoGo will get you something of your own on one of the cars! This can be almost anything! A picture of you or just your name to show you supported, a picture of a friend or family member who unfortunately had to fight or is fighting Breast Cancer, or even just something random (we must all be appropriate here!).</p>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, we(… that’s you and I) are starting from scratch, $0. After all, I am a 20 year old college student who is not fortunate enough to have the resources to fund the trip individually, or else you might have already seen me in your city!</p>
<p>First, I need to get an independent website designed for the project to get the word out and to begin securing sponsorship ads for on the cars to fund the trip. And as for the cars, I need those also. Once I begin securing advertisements however, I will be able to begin acquiring the things I need such as more vehicles.</p>
<p>I am looking to raise, through the support of you and other IndieGoGo visitors, enough money to have that website designed and purchase the first car. After all, I need a place to put the things you get to display in return for your support and the first set of sponsorship ads.</p>
<p>All who support through IndieGoGo will also get a mention on our website and a picture emailed to them showing their picture, graphic, or text on the vehicle (once it is filled) and a special thank you from myself and on behalf of all of those who will benefit from <strong><span class=""caps"">OUR</span></strong> donation of $1,000,000.</p>
<p>Even if <em>you</em> can’t donate, tell others, because if they do, then it happened because of <em>you</em>… not me. Letting them know is as easy as using a share option provided by our awesome friend here at IndieGoGo. I know your probably on some social site <em>creepin</em> on your friends right now… just click and share! You could be the link in the chain that saves a life with our big donation.</p>
<p>This is all about collaboration, we must bring together everyone we can and raise as much as we can. We can’t leave women alone in this fight against <strong>Breast Cancer</strong>, it’s going to take the attention of everyone, and that’s what I’m trying to promote. Anyone can make a huge difference, and it could be you. Donate, spread the word, both, or anything you can do to take action. <em>Now buckle up, and join us on the <strong>Trip 4 A Cure</strong></em>.</p>

He is totally into all kinds of music and has a lovely singing voice. He participates in the show choir at Prosper High School, is taking auto tech classes because he absolutely loves cars and wants to make a career working on and transforming cars into amazing machines!! Philip has many friends in Plano and Prosper, and thrives on friends, music, fun, and adventure! Philip also has a 21 year old sister, Tori, who shares his love for music and life in general! It is such a gift to hear them randomly singing harmony together. It is such a spontaneous joy!!</p>
<p>He hasnâ€™t had to go to the doctor for even so much as a cold for 2 years, except for viral pharyngitis and a cut hand. At the start of his junior year at Prosper High, he began getting sick. We were thinking it was just a virus or something mundane, but when he wasnâ€™t getting better, and had a couple bad nights in a row, he was taken to an emergency clinic to get checked out. His symptoms were nausea, vomiting, pain in his abdomen near the ribs, fatigue, dizziness, confusion, malaise. The docs first thought it could be a gall bladder attack so they did an ultrasound of the abdominal area. They didnâ€™t see anything on the gall bladder but saw spots on the liver. They then did a CT scan. That showed innumerable lesions and masses on and around the liver. Also the liver was markedly enlarged. This was rather alarming to say the least. That is when our world shifted.</p>
<p>The docs looked closer and submitted the scan results to an oncologist because they told me that it could be cancer by the way it looked. The oncologist ordered a liver biopsy. The biopsy came back malignant. They call it Neoplastic Adenocarcinoma. This type of cancer originates somewhere else and spreads to the liver, so they needed to do an endoscopy and colonoscopy to try to find the source tumor or tumors. They also did a PET/CT scan of the entire body. The result was that the origin tumor is in the sigmoid colon. Soâ€¦.now it is called stage IV colorectal cancer to the liver. All of these tests, etc. happened over the span of 1 week so needless to say itâ€™s been very exhausting and traumatic for Philip and the family.</p>
<p>The oncologist has consulted with cancer experts at M.D. Anderson, Baylor, and Texas Oncology and all of them are scratching their heads and are baffled to use the docâ€™s words. They have never encountered or heard of a 17 year old with this type of advanced colon cancer. It is uncharted territory. We think that Philip has his youth in his favor. The docs think that he will really be able to benefit from and tolerate the recommended chemotherapy very well. He will be undergoing chemo for 6 months, every 14 days. He will carry a medi-pump with him for 48 hours for his infusion, then go back to get un-hooked. He will go 1x each week for CBC blood counts and labs. He started his first round of chemo on September 20th. He has done very well and has not exhibited any strange side effects or reactions so far. Since his immune system is shot now, it may be inadvisable to return to school. I know this will devastate him because he really wants to feel as normal as possible as long as he can.</p>
<p>Philips last chemo session will be on March 14th, then we will be looking at and evaluating his overall health and the health of his liver. Docs think he will probably need a liver transplant. We hope it doesn't come to that so we are praying hard and asking everyone to pray for him as well.</p>
<p>WHAT YOU CAN DO, AND HOW BLESSED WE WOULD BE ... AT THIS POINT, ANY DONATION WILL BE EXTREMELY HELPFUL AS WE ARE FACED WITH AN EVER INCREASING PILE OF MEDICAL BILLS. NOT TO MENTION THE COST OF ONGOING CARE, FOOD, OTC MEDICATIONS, AND THE CARE OF THE REST OF MY FAMILY. HAVING BEEN UNEMPLOYED FOR SEVERAL MONTHS JUST PRIOR TO PHILIPS DIAGNOSIS, WE RAN THROUGH WHATEVER LITTLE WE HAD SET ASIDE. JUST BECAUSE PHILIP HAS THIS DREADFUL DEADLY DISEASE, DOESN'T MEAN CREDITORS AND COLLECTORS WILL STOP HOUNDING. THEY DON'T REALLY CARE. I JUST WANT TO BE ABLE TO FOCUS ON WHAT IS MOST IMPORTANT AND THAT IS PHILIP'S HEALTH AND WELL BEING. RELIEF IN ANY AMOUNT WLL GO A LONG WAY IN PROVIDING SOME RELIEF FROM THE WORRY.

<h2>The HOHTAI Mask Allows Athletes to Perform at Their Best</h2>
<p>We are proud to present the HOHTAI Mask, a revolutionary mask that allows athletes to perform at their very best while protecting them from the Coronavirus pandemic with patented Virus Shield® technology. The HOHTAI Mask is made with our unique HOHTAI fabric, a highly breathable fabric that is also gentle on the face. Wear the HOHTAI Mask in any situation, from intense exercise to daily life, without feeling the discomfort you may feel from conventional masks. Use the best of Japanese technology to make your life safer and more comfortable.</p>
<p>In Japanese, “HOHTAI” means bandage. The material and method used to make SIDO’s HOHTAI fabric are universally known throughout the world since doctors use similar materials. Bandages have already been developed to be breathable and light for close contact with the skin. These characteristics are the key to a naturally comfortable garment.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1607712512/lhzuqp3gi7xdeqqh6oti.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3><strong>How We Maximize the Comfort Level</strong></h3>
<p>When we founded SIDO, our top priority was to make the best underwear for athletes. An Athlete’s biggest enemy is sweat - the culprit of chafing, sticking, and stinking! We developed the HOHTAI fabric, a revolutionary quick-drying fabric that overcomes bothersome sticking and promotes ventilation.</p>
<p>We have received more and more requests for breathable face masks by high-performance athletes. In the chaos of the global Coronavirus pandemic, the demand is evermore present. In response to requests from top athletes who use HOHTAI Pants, our top-selling product line, we have started developing HOHTAI Masks that prevent virus infection and allow people to breathe easier with our moisture-wicking technology.</p>
<p> </p>

<li style=""list-style: none;height: 300px;"">With our HOHTAI Mask, there is less friction on the face due to the uneven mesh, unique to the bandage fabric. It achieves a comfortable fit that does not cling to the face. Less friction also allows for more airflow, preventing stuffiness.</li>

<li style=""list-style: none;height: 300px;"">HOHTAI fabric allows moisture from breathing to escape, promotes ventilation, and is quick-drying. The wearer stays comfortable with this breathable mask and will not become stuffy, even on hot summer days.</li>

<li style=""list-style: none;height: 200px;"">The cotton, polyester, and polyurethane woven into the bandage fabric prevent unnecessary adhesion to the skin and is the best material on hot summer days, for sports, and physical activity.</li>
</ul></div>
</div><p> </p><p> </p><h3>How Virus Shield® Protects You</h3><p>Conventional bandages are highly breathable, but cannot block the invasion of viruses. When developing the HOHTAI Mask we partnered with a major material manufacturer to use their Virus Shield® technology. The technology <strong>reduces virus transmission by 99%</strong> on the outer surface. By using our material on the inside, the HOHTAI Masks maintain an optimal comfort level for active users.</p><div style=""float: left;width: 50%;""><ul style=""padding-left:0px;""><li style=""list-style: none;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/5b0b873789c172d1d779ff08/1607717459548-4M7JNWF1REIM4DNVH17F/Pg3-Virus-5sec.gif"" src=""""/></li></ul></div><div style=""float: right;width: 50%;""><ul style=""padding-left:0px;""><li style=""list-style: none;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5b0b873789c172d1d779ff08/t/5fd3d33a11b2bc1377287bd3/1607717695379/Pg3-Smoke-5sec.gif"" src=""""/></li></ul></div><p> </p><div style=""float: right;width: 50%;""><ul style=""padding-left:0px;""></ul></div><hr/><h3>Japan Quality</h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1607731131/vc6ifbicu2bqfphwieuv.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>We specifically developed and patented the unique “HOHTAI” fabric by improving medical bandages and created a revolutionary cotton material that is breathable and light.</p><p>We have changed our pattern more than 30 times, testing and revising each pattern along the way.

The HOHTAI Mask is made with our unique HOHTAI fabric, a highly breathable fabric that is also gentle on the face. Wear the HOHTAI Mask in any situation, from intense exercise to daily life, without feeling the discomfort you may feel from conventional masks. Use the best of Japanese technology to make your life safer and more comfortable.
In Japanese, “HOHTAI” means bandage. The material and method used to make SIDO’s HOHTAI fabric are universally known throughout the world since doctors use similar materials. Bandages have already been developed to be breathable and light for close contact with the skin. These characteristics are the key to a naturally comfortable garment.

How We Maximize the Comfort Level
When we founded SIDO, our top priority was to make the best underwear for athletes. An Athlete’s biggest enemy is sweat - the culprit of chafing, sticking, and stinking! We developed the HOHTAI fabric, a revolutionary quick-drying fabric that overcomes bothersome sticking and promotes ventilation.
We have received more and more requests for breathable face masks by high-performance athletes. In the chaos of the global Coronavirus pandemic, the demand is evermore present. In response to requests from top athletes who use HOHTAI Pants, our top-selling product line, we have started developing HOHTAI Masks that prevent virus infection and allow people to breathe easier with our moisture-wicking technology.
 


With our HOHTAI Mask, there is less friction on the face due to the uneven mesh, unique to the bandage fabric. It achieves a comfortable fit that does not cling to the face. Less friction also allows for more airflow, preventing stuffiness.



HOHTAI fabric allows moisture from breathing to escape, promotes ventilation, and is quick-drying. The wearer stays comfortable with this breathable mask and will not become stuffy, even on hot summer days.

The cotton, polyester, and polyurethane woven into the bandage fabric prevent unnecessary adhesion to the skin and is the best material on hot summer days, for sports, and physical activity.

  How Virus Shield® Protects YouConventional bandages are highly breathable, but cannot block the invasion of viruses. When developing the HOHTAI Mask we partnered with a major material manufacturer to use their Virus Shield® technology. The technology reduces virus transmission by 99% on the outer surface. By using our material on the inside, the HOHTAI Masks maintain an optimal comfort level for active users. Japan QualityWe specifically developed and patented the unique “HOHTAI” fabric by improving medical bandages and created a revolutionary cotton material that is breathable and light.We have changed our pattern more than 30 times, testing and revising each pattern along the way. Now, we have finally developed the ideal shape.Also, the HOHTAI Mask’s special stitches and design wick away the sweat that would be absorbed by other traditional face masks and promotes a dry surface for your face at all times.Everything from cutting to sewing is handmade by highly experienced Japanese professionals. We are pleased to present the HOHTAI Mask, a revolutionary mask that combines 2 Made-in-Japan technologies; SIDO’s HOHTAI fabric and Virus Shield®. Supporting AthletesIt is proven that a lack of oxygen may reduce IQ and fitness levels while increasing anxiety. However, in the chaos of the Coronavirus pandemic, a mask has become essential. Our priority is to provide athletes and daily users with a mask that supports peak performance and comfort.Not only athletes, but we support people in many different industries who love to perform at their best even in this chaotic era. What We Offer Perks SOCIAL MEDIA Can’t support us financially?

 What We're Made OfA series of third-party sleep studies have examined the adverse impact of sleep deprivation on various medical conditions. The findings of these studies? Compared to cheaper, lower density foam and traditional innerspring mattresses, sleeping on high-density memory foam surfaces improved sleep quality and duration, and it reduced the painful symptoms of medical conditions, including chronic lower back pain, arthritis, Alzheimer’s, sleep apnea, fibromyalgia, pregnancy and circulatory issues.At MajesticBeds, we’ve taken our retail mattress designs to the next level, with four pressure-relieving layers that work together to bring you the very best night’s sleep.The LayersAll MajesticBed™ mattresses utilize a layered system for the adaptive support and comfort needed to aid in mobility, stabilize the spine, and provide adaptive comfort with a cooling surface that does not restrict circulation. 
Patented technology in the Ergo Gel Layer absorbs excess body heat while its pressure-relieving gel design eases painful hip and shoulder counter pressure.
Proprietary Ergo Comfort Layer molds to your body contours to create proper spinal support while reacting immediately to changes in your sleeping position.
Patented technology in the Ergo Transition Layer enhances the comfort layer’s ability to envelop the shoulders and hips, while minimizing surface counter pressure to further relieve shoulder and hip pain.
Ergo Core heavy density base foam creates the firmness needed to provide proper spinal support through a stabilizing edge-to-edge sleep surface.
 The Evolution Of Gel TherapyFour decades of medical research culminated in the patented technology we use in the innovative Ergo Gel Layer found on all MajesticBeds sleep systems (excludes Ergo Comfort). Our Ergo Gel Layer’s unique pattern uses a non-toxic, soy-based gel that is incredibly durable and biodegradable.This gel is poured into a soccer ball pattern of pliable polyurethane to provide the perfect balance of orthopedic spinal support and pressure reduction. The Ergo Gel Layer neutralizes pressure by conforming around the hips and shoulders to minimize pressure points, producing proper spinal alignment and ensuring unrestricted blood circulation in both back and side sleepers of all shapes and sizes.Over time, MajesticBed mattress designs have evolved into a combination of comfort layers complementing the top Ergo Gel Layer to create a cooling sleep surface that relieves chronic shoulder and hip joint pain.The result is deeper, healthier, more restorative sleep. Our ProductsA Fusion of Form and FunctionAdjustable MajesticPillow with a premium upgrade Cooling Pillow ProtectorFORM An adjustable, uniquely shaped pillow designed to provide proper support of the cervical curve of the neck, cradle the head and relieve pressure on sensitive shoulder joints for side sleepers. An incredibly comfortable and supportive pillow!FUNCTIONFor sleep apnea patients on a CPAP, the MajesticPillow properly supports the cervical curve, ensuring the airway is open and encouraging the patient to be more compliant and consistent in using their CPAP oxygen delivery system.For whiplash, neck injuries or recovering from cervical surgery, the MajesticPillow comfortably stabilizes the neck, maintaining proper cervical alignment for both back and side sleepers to relieve and lower pain levels. This aids in recovery by minimizing movement throughout the night.Extended computer use or seated desk work causes poor posture, leading to sore shoulders and a stiff neck due to the cervical curve being abnormally straightened. The MajesticPillow comfortably relaxes and maintains the cervical curve while reducing the stress on sore shoulders for a more restful, restorative night’s sleep. Majestic Fusion Topper1) The counter pressure against shoulder has been eliminated by the Majestic Fusion Topper, providing soothing enveloping comfort around the joint.2) The spine is now properly supported and aligned from the hips through the shoulders, minimizing the chance of spinal stress and allowing the muscles to relax.3) Majestic Fusion Topper has eliminated the retail mattress’s painful counter pressure against the hips. The hips are now properly aligned, allowing the hips and lower back muscles to relax,  and the spine is properly supported and aligned.FORM Combines two patented technologies – the cooling, pressure relieving Ergo Gel Layer and the durable, gentle support of the Ergo Transition Layer – with the proprietary, pressure neutralizing Ergo Comfort Layer to create a 3” mattress topper. The patent pending Majestic Fusion Topper works on any surface and immediately molds to any body size and shape and adapts to changes in sleeping position. The Majestic Fusion Topper absorbs more excess body heat all night long compared to all other mattress toppers regardless of price.FUNCTIONRelieves painful mattress counter-pressure on sensitive joints, minimizing muscle stress and helping promote proper spine alignment.Provides an economical alternative to purchasing a new mattress while adding unrivaled comfort and support.For cancer patients on chemotherapy- helps relieve joint pain and absorbs hot flashes and night sweats with its pressure relieving components, heat absorbing cover and Ergo Gel Layer to help the patient sleep cooler and more comfortable. This helps keep them cool and comfortable, affording the rest needed to aid in their recovery.For fibromyalgia sufferers- helps address sensitivity to pressure and heat to help reduce their pain level. A better night’s sleep helps reduce fatigue, which in turn reduces their sensitivity to pain.For menopausal women- provides a cooling, pressure-relieving surface that works all night so they can get the rest they need.Patent Pending Ergo Comfort Mattress FORM Adapts to your individual body contours for proper spinal support and personalized comfort for a more restful, restorative night’s sleep. The pressure-relieving Ergo Comfort Layer with its cooling mattress cover absorbs excess body heat so you sleep cooler and more comfortably. An edge-to-edge sleep surface independently molds to each person’s body mass and does not telegraph your partner’s motion. Our fast-recovering surface means you can change sleeping positions easily.Four-way, super-stretch mattress cover with cooling technology combined with the no-flip mattress is hypoallergenic and hinders growth of dust mites and microbial organisms.The Ergo Comfort Mattress includes a 15-year limited warranty with comfort exchange option.FUNCTIONCushioning envelopment surpasses all “bed in a box” mattresses for unrivaled comfort for pressure-sensitive sleepers suffering from arthritis, fibromyalgia, diabetes, circulatory issues, hip and shoulder pain, sundowners from dementia, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy, Parkinson’s disease and lupus.Stabilizing spinal support helps those suffering from sciatica, scoliosis, disc issues and limited mobility.Relieves back stress and pain for back and side sleepers. Patent Pending MajesticBed MattressFORMFour comfort layers deliver exceptional pressure-relieving comfort, creating a soothing sleep surface:Patented Ergo Gel layer absorbs more excess body heat for cooler sleep and conforms to your body, providing more comfort than any other retail sleep surface.Two Ergo Comfort Layers of liquid gel-infused, second-generation high-density memory foam separated by our patented Ergo Transition Layer provides pressure relief and adaptive spinal support.The firmness of the high-density Ergo Core Layer creates the stability needed for spinal support for back and side sleepers, as well as the support needed to create the edge-to-edge sleep surface that independently molds to each person’s body mass.The patent-pending MajesticBed Mattress design relieves pressure-point pain on tender joints and provides unrestricted circulation. It alleviates even the most chronic shoulder and hip pain, while providing adaptive spinal support to relieve back pain. Its fast recovering surface makes it easier to change sleeping position and does not telegraph partner’s motion.The 4-way stretchable, poly-jacquard fabric cover with cooling technology does not reflect body heat and is allergen resistant. And the no-flip, hypoallergenic, antimicrobial and anti-dust mite mattress is backed by a 15-year warranty and exchange option. FUNCTIONStabilizing spinal support and soothing, pressure-relieving body comfort, especially for chronic hip and shoulder joint pain.Absorbs more excess body heat to sleep cooler and more comfortable for those suffering from reactions to chemotherapy, hot flashes, menopause or just sleeping too hot.Cushioning envelopment for unrivaled comfort for pressure-sensitive sleepers suffering from arthritis, fibromyalgia,  diabetes, circulatory issues, hip and shoulder pain, sundowners from dementia, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy, Parkinson’s disease and lupus.Stabilizing spinal support helps those suffering from sciatica, scoliosis, disc issues and limited mobility.Relieves back stress and pain for back and side sleepers. Risks & Challenges:Every endeavor may have its risks and challenges, but there aren’t many with MajesticBeds! Our products are market-tested with more than 25 years of incredible results, helping one person at a time find a more supportive, comfortable sleep surface for a truly restful, restorative night’s sleep. MajesticBed sleepers have consistently reported reduced fatigue, reduced pain sensitivities to their medical symptoms and physical issues, and an improved quality of life.All facets of production and fulfillment are in place in anticipation for our Indiegogo launch. Our domestic manufacturing partners can easily absorb anticipated increases in demand, keeping production time challenges to a minimum. Our production partners and fulfillment systems can produce and ship our MajesticBed pillow, Fusion Mattress Toppers and Majestic Mattress orders in the time frames we set for the Indiegogo.We use only American manufacturing plants in all facets of our bedding production because we believe and demand the quality that comes from made-in-the-USA products. We support American workers. This also means we are not challenged by delays that can occur with international suppliers.  We have worked hard over the last 18 months to build up these relationships in preparation for this endeavor and expect to meet all of our delivery deadlines with the launch of this Indiegogo campaign.",15.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>OTEN Medical Wants to Help Fellow Nurses in Crisis</h3>
<p>OTEN Medical is a start-up company founded by nurses that work on the floor, in the ICU, and dialysis units. We know what it takes to deliver excellent patient care and be effective.  We saw a need to create a product to organize peripheral IV lines and ventilator tubing for patients admitted to the hospital.  So we created 2 patent-pending products to help keep lines off the floor, reducing risk for infection, and decreasing the risk for accidental dislodgment resulting from pulling or tripping over tangled lines.  We created the <strong>iLine</strong> to hold general IV lines, feeding tubes, and blood lines. For complex ICU patients on ventilators, we created the<strong> iLine Select</strong> designed to hold ventilator respiratory tubing on one side and multiple other IV lines on the other.</p>
<p>With this sudden crisis on our hands we realized that our product can help organize lines <strong>outside</strong> of patient rooms and even organize lines for patients that are on gurneys receiving care in ED departments.  <strong>Our healthcare heroes across the nation need more Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) STAT!</strong> While our product is not a PPE, it is helping to conserve PPE and limit  exposure.  Our product is being used to secure IV lines outside COVID-19 patient rooms in order to save on PPE and reduce in and out exposure into the room.  </p>
<p>By putting IV infusion pumps just outside of the patient's room:</p>
<ul>
<li>Saves on PPE usage</li>
<li>Helps unnecessary staff exposure from patient contact</li>
<li>Keeps lines off the floor</li>
</ul>

<h3>We NEED your help!</h3>
<p>We've been creating these products using our 3D printers in our El Paso, TX facility.  This 3D process takes a long time, and we need your help immediately to donate over 10,000 units to more hospitals.  To print just four iLines and iLine Selects, it takes us 17 hours.  As you can see this is a timely process, and we need to create the tooling necessary to mass produce via injection molding.  This is why it is imperative for you to help us with this task.  </p>

<h3>Help Make a Difference NOW!</h3>
<p>We are hopeful that we are flattening the curve and the practices of shelter in place seem to be working.  However, the need for PPE and maximizing its use still exists.  Check out this video highlighting <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/videos/health/2020/04/11/coronavirus-nurses-go-there-pkg-vpx.cnn/video/playlists/atv-go-there/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">how nursing staff continues to struggle for more PPE everyday</a>.  </p>
<h3>Take Care of Our Healthcare Workers.</h3>
<p>While we cannot make the PPE equipment, we can help. We have many hospitals throughout the US that are already impacted.  Many companies are giving masks and PPE.  <strong><i>The CDC standard practice of PPE is such that staff puts it on right before they enter a patients room.  What happens next is to discard the PPE.</i></strong>  However, the demands are so abnormally large for PPE, that the <strong>staff has to reuse repeatedly throughout the day.  Even worse, for many days</strong>.  Of course they do not want to do this, but they have no choice as there is a mass shortage. Isolation techniques of PPE use has changed due to COVID-19.  Now while other companies are providing masks and PPE, we can help adjust the way we practice by placing the iLines and iLine Selects outside the patient’s door to safely hang IV lines. By doing so, we can help staff manage IV infusion pumps outside the patients room, thus conserving more protective gear and limiting unnecessary exposure into COVID-19 rooms.  This can result in safer patient care and help prevent staff getting sick themselves. </p>

</p></div>","Who We Are
My name is Dave Anderson, and I have been in the
technology industry for 22 years, driving marketing, strategy and
operations.  My passion is developing technology that solves critical
business problems and provides value to customers that helps them save money,
and operate more effectively. 
One year ago, I was talking with a colleague who managed
data analysis for clinical trials and drug compound research, who was working
with several pharmaceutical companies on drug development for diabetes
treatment.  I wanted an update on where drug development was headed, as my
young son has Type 1 diabetes. 
After multiple discussions, it became apparent there was a
critical data management problem.  The
amount of “big data”, both structured and unstructured, now available to the
health care industry has the potential to allow researchers, analysts, and
scientists to be much more effective in how they work and make decisions.  These data sets are so enormous, that it is
virtually impossible to securely and efficiently capture, store, share,
analyze, correlate and visualize this data with the limited tools and manual
processes currently available.  The sheer
volume of data that is available that “could” be used in making decisions can
easily be multiple terabytes in size. . .a significant and unenviable challenge
to manage when a single terabyte could hold 1,000 copies of the Encyclopedia
Britannica, and ten terabytes could hold the printed collection of the Library
of Congress.  
Working with these massive data sets, and the inability to
properly correlate and analyze these disparate data sets, leads to decisions
being made with sometimes only 40% of the available data.  If the data
can’t be easily and securely captured and correlated, it’s simply not included
in the analysis process.  In healthcare,
these critical decisions, such as approving a trial to move from phase 1 to
phase 2, or approving a drug compound research objective, were being made
without all the necessary data, and honestly this scared me. 
Coheezion was created to solve this problem; to be able to
comprehensively and securely collect, correlate, and manage the available data
that needs to be analyzed, and through new visualization and data modeling
capabilities, allow companies to make better, more informed, and more effective
decisions.  Decisions that lead directly to enormous cost savings and
efficiencies, and new revenue and business opportunities.   Check us out here!What We Need
Coheezion’s critical need is $5,000 investment to develop
our initial minimum viable product and proof of concept.  We have
identified our initial beta customers who will be instrumental in providing
feedback and helping to shape the product functionality and user experience,
and the investment will go directly to funding the engineering efforts, both
resources to code and a few needed technology licenses, that will develop the
POC for these beta customers.  One beta customer told me directly, “our
visualization and analytic capability currently consists of a few pivot tables
and an Access database dashboard.  What you have shown will instrumentally
change how we do business.”
The Impact
Imagine one individual, or even at best, a small team,
sitting in an office, attempting to manually read, process and analyze multiple
data reports which can often be multiple gig’s in size and larger, attempting
to correlate in their brain what the data means, how one data set impacts
another, and any deep insights that might be hidden in the data.  Now
assume that much of this data is unstructured data, and not something that can
be easily and quickly manipulated into a readable format.  This reality is
what makes data analytics in the health care industry, and really any industry,
very difficult and inefficient, which is why much of the data that is really
needed to help in decision analytics is simply not included.  There is no
easy way to collect, process and analyze much of this data, and the result is
that it is simply just ignored. 
Coheezion will add immediate value to any company by being
able to comprehensively manage structured and unstructured data together, and
use visualizations that are far more sophisticated then pivot tables and basic
dashboards, to show relationships and interdependencies between data sets that
seem completely unrelated to the naked eye. 
The value in this allows companies to not only use ALL the
data that’s available to them in their analysis and decision process, but to do
so in a very cost effective and simply way. 
The leaders of Coheezion have successful track records in
working closely with customers of all sizes, across multiple industries, to
deeply understand their problems and deliver technology solutions that solve
these problems and add value. 
Our advisors and team have the world-class expertise in
data analytics, decision modeling and creating solutions that companies want
and value.  Our passion is on the customer, and delivering what they need
to solve their problems.  We’re looking forward to the ride!

<p>Uplift is a mission to put at least 10% of the amputee population in developing countries newly or back to the workforce by 2025 through the synergy between technology innovation, human empowerment and sustainable business practices. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p>We'll use this Indiegogo campaign to fund the putting of prosthetics onto 30 beneficiaries.

<p>As we believe in meaningful products, we created a range of <strong>rewards</strong> linked to both our philosophy and design process.

<p>Waiter modules that can be 'plug &amp; play' - instantly adapted to job</p>
<p><strong>Secondly</strong>, the partners. We work with NGOs and organizations that have connections and influence over the PWD community to help us raise awareness about the job opportunities, to empower amputees to join the force as well as to connect the project’s beneficiaries with other possible resources and support.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>At its most basic level, this campaign will fundamentally change 30 lives and get them back on the road to support themselves and their families. Our Impact Proposition can be simplified into <strong>3 Main Points;</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><u><strong>EMPOWERMENT:</strong></u></h3>
<p>Uplift fosters independence and empowerment through giving amputees the ability to not only function but to excel at what they do. They are also <strong>making a statement</strong> by using our prosthetics in full view of the public.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><u><strong>LIFE-LONG VALUE:</strong></u></h3>
<p>Amputations don’t go away. We expect to be a life-long partner with our users, growing and sharing everything with them. <strong>Their success is our success</strong>.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><u><strong>SOCIAL AWARENESS:</strong></u></h3>
<p>Uplift aims to change how society sees amputees, but more importantly, how amputees see themselves - <strong>not as broken; but full of potential</strong>. It's about time society changed their perspective on the disabled.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong><u>WHAT NEXT?</u></strong></h3>
<p><br/><strong>We are not asking for money to build a product</strong>. We are asking for help to get the product we already have onto the first generation of users and to show that the next evolution of man/machine technology can be accessible to everyone.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1554605018/dycll6sutrstkgliucke.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The existing products and designs just aren’t working. </strong><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Many prosthetics on the market only has a few functions, if not only one. Yet t</span>hey're expensive, hard to use, difficult to access, and don’t help people do what they really need: <strong>Supporting themselves and their families.</strong></p>

</div></div>","At Vulcan, we have a bright vision for the future - to change the world's perspective on amputees and people with disabilities.
 

We develop prosthetics aimed to serve lower to middle-income amputees in developing countries through specific modules that can be attached to their daily-used prosthetic arm. To take a step further, we created UpLift.
 
UPLIFT:
Uplift is a mission to put at least 10% of the amputee population in developing countries newly or back to the workforce by 2025 through the synergy between technology innovation, human empowerment and sustainable business practices. 
 
We'll use this Indiegogo campaign to fund the putting of prosthetics onto 30 beneficiaries. That’s 30 lives changed, 30 products out there, and 30 people who will be driving the future development of human augmenting technology. For us, this means we can help the first generation of users get out there and earning independent income with the job-oriented attachments.
 

 
As we believe in meaningful products, we created a range of rewards linked to both our philosophy and design process. Our backers will each get something representing part of who we are and what we do, and those who sponsor a whole arm will also get a plaque listing them as a foundation backer, and a quote of their choice on a matching plate on the arm they sponsored. 

3D printed miniature robotic arm for our backers
 
OUR APPROACH:
There are two parts to making Uplift a reality. Firstly, the product. The first job-specific module that Vulcan is developing in relation to the Uplift project is the Waiter module, specially-tailored for every waitressing task.

Waiter modules that can be 'plug & play' - instantly adapted to job
Secondly, the partners. We work with NGOs and organizations that have connections and influence over the PWD community to help us raise awareness about the job opportunities, to empower amputees to join the force as well as to connect the project’s beneficiaries with other possible resources and support.

 
At its most basic level, this campaign will fundamentally change 30 lives and get them back on the road to support themselves and their families. Our Impact Proposition can be simplified into 3 Main Points;
 
EMPOWERMENT:
Uplift fosters independence and empowerment through giving amputees the ability to not only function but to excel at what they do. They are also making a statement by using our prosthetics in full view of the public.
 
LIFE-LONG VALUE:
Amputations don’t go away. We expect to be a life-long partner with our users, growing and sharing everything with them. Their success is our success.
 
SOCIAL AWARENESS:
Uplift aims to change how society sees amputees, but more importantly, how amputees see themselves - not as broken; but full of potential. It's about time society changed their perspective on the disabled.
 
WHAT NEXT?
We are not asking for money to build a product. We are asking for help to get the product we already have onto the first generation of users and to show that the next evolution of man/machine technology can be accessible to everyone.

 
The existing products and designs just aren’t working. Many prosthetics on the market only has a few functions, if not only one. Yet they're expensive, hard to use, difficult to access, and don’t help people do what they really need: Supporting themselves and their families.
 

 
 
Robotic arms that make amputees independent not only physically, mentally, but also financially
 
 
 
 

Our prosthetics look however you want them to look. Want to cosplay Deus Ex? Can do. If you fancy something more reserved, skin covers are available. Want your own specific colour or pattern? Go online and get a quote.
The full potential of this component is only possible with your help. By contributing to Uplift, it allows us to experiment more and enter new markets and industries by creating more unique and task-specific grips.
The limit is our creativity.
 
 

 
 

""I saw other groups attempting to solve the same problem and felt that the technology had so much potential that was not being used efficiently and effectively with the end USER in mind. That is why I founded Vulcan Augmetics, to make technology work for people, and to help people get the most out of that technology.""

<h3>Help Shave a Head and Save Some Lives</h3>
<p>Hello friends, family, colleagues, esteemed business persons and multibillionaire philanthropists! My name is Joey Saffren and I am a college student at Texas State University. For this little project, I will be doing something that I have never done in my entire life: I will be shaving my head. Now to most people, shaving your head isn't very big of a deal, but what you need to understand is that I have never been bald. I was one of those lucky people born with a full head of hair. One sexy baby indeed! But this isn't about me and my amazing head of baby hair, this is about something more serious. Cancer has been a prevalent issue in my family, so the idea of losing someone or have someone suffer from cancer has always concerned me.</p>
<p>I've always wanted to do something to help, but never had a good idea on what to do. Then I heard about people who get sponsored to shave their heads. I thought that was a perfect idea and knew that that is what I wanted to do. Even though I don't have enough hair to donate it, I can still be supportive by shaving my head and donating my sponsors money to research.</p>
<h3>Why MD Anderson</h3>
<p>I chose to donate the money to MD Anderson Cancer Center because as of right now, they are ranked as the number one cancer center in the United States by U.S. News. Their facilities are ranked the highest in every category from how many nurses and doctors they hold on staff to how many patients they discharge successfully. With this money ""<span>MD Anderson Cancer Center will make a difference in the lives of cancer patients now and in the future by supporting innovative cancer patient care, research, education and prevention programs at one of the world's most outstanding comprehensive cancer centers."" </span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Why Should You Donate?</h3>
<p>People often don't donate to charities or organizations because they don't want to have to give a big sum of money and they don't feel small sums will be appreciated. Well here is your chance then! Even if you can only spare a dollar, with enough people that will soon equal hundreds. It doesn't matter how much you donate. As long as you are able to spare even the smallest amounts, you will make a difference and you will change someone's life. </p>
<p>But I know what your thinking, ""If I'm spending this money, I want something in return!"" Well this is your chance to get prizes in return for donating! Now you have to understand, I'm a poor college student, so the prizes are going to be things I am able to do without spending money. But I've come up with some pretty creative things, so hopefully you can find something worth donating for! :)</p>
<p> </p>

<p>About five years ago, they began to try to have children and raise a family.  They couldn’t get pregnant and, after two years, began seeing doctors.  They went to numerous doctors and specialists, had tests run on both of them, and tried different medications and therapy.  Everything was to no avail.  As any of you who have had a medical condition requiring lots of doctor appointments and tests can verify, it can be very expensive. Very few insurance companies, including theirs, cover these kinds of tests. </p>
<p>In April, they went to yet another fertility specialist in Montana. With all of the anatomy and physiology involved, there are numerous things that can affect the ability to conceive naturally.  As the medical system goes, each test is for a part of the reproductive system.  If a part is working, but at a less than normal level, it can effect the chances of getting pregnant without being a definitive cause for not being able to. </p>
<p>The doctorcan’t say what the problem is exactly, but she feels that Melissa will not get pregnant without the use of Invetro Fertilization.  This can be a very expensive procedure.  Invetro is a process where the doctor surgically goes into the woman and removes all her eggs.  Then the doctor takes the eggs and fertilizes the eggs with the man’s sperm outside of the woman’s body.  Once an embryo forms, it is placed back into the female’s body to continue developing into a baby. </p>
<p>Wanting to be parents, they are also moving forward to foster/adopt.  They have taken classes to become licensed to be foster or adoptive parents.  Adoption can also be a long and expensive process.  Private adoption companies charge for their services and the couple is expected to pay before there is any assurance the adoption will go through.  Also, travel expenses can add up quickly. </p>
<p>I would like your help with a Christmas present like no other.  I am trying to help them fulfill their dream of becoming parents.  I’m asking  for you to consider donating whatever you feel you and your family can financially give in order to help them achieve their dream of becoming parents.  Whatever amount you feel led to give will be a blessing to them.  If you cannot donate, they completely understand. </p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>     My name is Marina and I am a rhythmic gymnastics coach, fashion designer, personal trainer, model and dancer. I competed as a rhythmic gymnast for 6 years and was top in the nation before I got injured at the age of 13. My injury led to the development of avascular nicrosis of my left hip. It was probably one of the most heartbreaking moments in my life when the doctors told me that I would not be able to walk normally ever again, let alone dance or compete. They were convinced that my leg would never grow to its full length, and they said I would need hip replacement because there is no other solution. I have been doing everything in my power to prove them wrong.</p>
<p>My path has been in the direction of homeopathic medication and constant exercise which has helped me keep my leg as healthy as possible. After extensive research of new treatments and procedures, I have thankfully found an alternative to hip replacement and have been accepted as a candidate in a stem cell treatment by Regenexx.</p>
<p> </p>

 is an everyday 28 years old male from Sofia, Bulgaria. He loves 
climbing, football and travelling and he enjoys the company of his 
loving wife and family. He is just a person, like you and me... </p>
In October 2012 Emil was diagnosed with testicular cancer. About a month later he had
 an operation to remove the entity in which was detected the presence of
 a malignant tumor of mixed type -  seminoma and embryonal carcinoma. 
For the ones who don't know, embryonal carcinoma is a very aggressive 
type of tumor that usually develops in young men. After the tests we 
started realizing how serious Emil's situation actually is...<p>
<br/>The
 treatment started with the first appointment of two courses of 
chemotherapy. Luckily the cancer was detected in its early stage and at 
the time the doctors were confident that the treatment will have an 
effect and eventually destroy the carcinomas. We really thought that 
this might be it but unfortunately
 only three months after the treatment, in March 2013, after control 
examination the doctors told us that Emil's tumor markers and MRI have 
increased and the cancer had spread to the lymph nodes. It wasn't 
pleasant experience but we had to accept the facts and start treatment 
again. </p>
<p><br/>The
 doctors administered new four course chemotherapy and this time they 
recommended the strongest medication for this type of disease. In early 
July, the therapy was completed after 4 courses. Emil lost weight, hair 
and became pale. He certainly did not enjoy the treatment but did not 
complain either.</p>
<p><br/>In
 the next four months all went well as there were no signs of 
development and Emil started recovering. Even in November 2013 the PET 
scanner examinations were positive confirming that the cancer is not 
spreading. We were really happy thinking that Emil had beaten cancer and we were all going to close this dark chapter of our lives.</p>
<p><br/>Emil
 started getting back to normal life of caring husband and honest tax 
payer. Everything was going well until he went for a control NMRI that 
found new metastasis. The results were devastating! The oncologists
 administered radical lymph nodes extraction. The operation was 
conducted on 25.02.2014. We knew how serious the situations is but we 
were hoping that his might be the end, we thought this could be the 
turning point were the problem will be over. However we were wrong, it 
turned out that the real fight was about to begin...</p>
<p><br/>Since
 then we've met with various doctors from Bulgaria and they said that 
they can't do much but they advised us to start looking for treatment 
abroad. So we did! After couple months of research we got in touch with 
oncologists from Israel who confirmed that they will be able to help. 
Emil went for examination to Tel Aviv and the doctors confirmed that his
 type of cancer is treatable! They confirmed that high dose chemo with peripheral stem cell implant will not only help Emil live longer but it actually might cure him!</p>
<p>The
 only problem is that the good things come with a price tax. The 
treatment has a fixed price impossible for Emil to afford - 110,000 EUR.
 Such sum might be considered a good news in Western Europe or USA but 
it certainly isn't' in Bulgaria. Even though that Emil's case was 
covered on national TV in Bulgaria, we still have less than 10% of the 
sum required. The treatment is required ASAP and will begin as soon as 
funds are available. The doctors told that we can wait up to three 
months. </p>

It took her years and at least 100 doctors/hospital/specialist appointments and visits to finally receive a proper diagnosis. </h3>
<p>In March 2014 Heather was 50% better in beating lyme, this has to do with her amazing lyme doctor &amp; her extraordinary chiropractor and naturopath team &amp; her own strength.  Heather was on same antibiotics for 18 months, she got bit by ‘something’ weeks ago, ever since then she went from being 50% better to only 10% better with 80% of her previous lyme symptoms returning.  She was bit by an unknown bug in late march which caused her ankle to turn red and swell double it’s size, insane itch, she wasn’t able to walk and I took her to the hospital emergency 3 times in one week to get no help, no referrals, nothing. For the last 6 months there was so much improvement, so much hope and light, and now, to be perfectly honesty, we are scared. Physically and neurologically it is as if Heather’s state is as it was before we even started lyme treatment back in September 2012.  I have to help her wash her hair, I have to prepare all of her meals, do her laundry and dishes as her joints are swollen, painful and inflamed and she can’t do the things she normally did for the last 6 months as this new ‘infection’ is making all symptoms return that were seemingly gone.  We have made an emergency appointment to go back to her lyme doctor only a month after seeing her, as everything we were doing (medication/supplement/etc wise) is no longer working.  So far, in 2014 Heather has gotten shingles 3 times &amp; is currently trying to recover from them again. Her immune system is compromised and this is the cause of them recurring.</p>

<p>Thank you to heather’s loving online family, on redbubble and face book, to her friends and even strangers that have donated in the past, shared this link, and supported her with love, kindness and patience and unconditional love during her journey. I couldn’t have helped heather go this far without all of you beautiful souls, and I don’t know what we would do without you. It’s a scary time, Heather likes to put on a brave face, but I myself am not only her best friend, but caregiver and have been watching her rapidly decline over the last few weeks. I need your help now more than ever.</p>
<p>If you know you were bitten by a tick and seek immediate treatment in Canada you go on antibiotics for a few weeks and you’re cured. If you didn’t know you were bit by a tick the tick not only infects you with a devastating bacteria, but it lays its eggs in your body which hatch in 18 days. Heather went almost 4 years in extreme physical pain, I watched her mind and body deteriorate in the most devastating way. Going to every medical appointment, ambulance ride, neurosurgeon, MRI, family dr visit and never getting an answer, having it all blamed on her ‘anxiety’ I decided to take matters into my own hands and researched full time, it was months of extensive research that all signs and symptoms pointed to lyme disease.  In Canada treatment beyond a month is NOT available. Chronic lyme is not treated in Canada, and the few doctors who have done so, have lost their license.  This is why we have to travel to the USA every 3 months for treatment and expensive antibiotics which are not covered.</p>
<p>The majority of people with Lyme disease are misdiagnosed for years and by the time it is discovered it is almost too late</p>

<p>In 2009 Heather had a gym membership, walked 5 miles a day, hiked, spent time in nature, and constantly doing photo shoots. Now, she can't walk more than 20 minutes, becomes so fatigued far too quickly, has difficulty breathing, chest pains, migraines, her joints swell up so bad she can't write or type, difficulty folding laundry, doing dishes and playing with her cat.

</div></div>","Hi my name is Kristy Lockhart and my best friend was diagnosed with Lyme Disease in 2012 after being misdiagnosed for many years. It took her years and at least 100 doctors/hospital/specialist appointments and visits to finally receive a proper diagnosis. 
In March 2014 Heather was 50% better in beating lyme, this has to do with her amazing lyme doctor & her extraordinary chiropractor and naturopath team & her own strength.  Heather was on same antibiotics for 18 months, she got bit by ‘something’ weeks ago, ever since then she went from being 50% better to only 10% better with 80% of her previous lyme symptoms returning.  She was bit by an unknown bug in late march which caused her ankle to turn red and swell double it’s size, insane itch, she wasn’t able to walk and I took her to the hospital emergency 3 times in one week to get no help, no referrals, nothing. For the last 6 months there was so much improvement, so much hope and light, and now, to be perfectly honesty, we are scared. Physically and neurologically it is as if Heather’s state is as it was before we even started lyme treatment back in September 2012.  I have to help her wash her hair, I have to prepare all of her meals, do her laundry and dishes as her joints are swollen, painful and inflamed and she can’t do the things she normally did for the last 6 months as this new ‘infection’ is making all symptoms return that were seemingly gone.  We have made an emergency appointment to go back to her lyme doctor only a month after seeing her, as everything we were doing (medication/supplement/etc wise) is no longer working.  So far, in 2014 Heather has gotten shingles 3 times & is currently trying to recover from them again. Her immune system is compromised and this is the cause of them recurring.

Thank you to heather’s loving online family, on redbubble and face book, to her friends and even strangers that have donated in the past, shared this link, and supported her with love, kindness and patience and unconditional love during her journey. I couldn’t have helped heather go this far without all of you beautiful souls, and I don’t know what we would do without you. It’s a scary time, Heather likes to put on a brave face, but I myself am not only her best friend, but caregiver and have been watching her rapidly decline over the last few weeks. I need your help now more than ever.

<h3>Our Mission<br/>
</h3>
<p>Our team of eleven Orthotics and Prosthetics Graduate students from 
Northwestern University will be traveling to Guatemala for a week long 
volunteer effort with the community of Zacapa, Guatemala. We will be 
working with The Range of Motion Project (ROMP) which has fully staffed 
clinical sites in Guatemala and Ecuador. Our days will consist of 
clinical evaluations of patients, fabricating prostheses (artificial 
limbs) and orthoses (walking braces), educating patients on proper wear 
and care of their prosthetic and orthotic devices and most importantly, 
giving the individuals in this community the opportunity to walk once 
again and improve their daily lives. Without the help of volunteer teams like ours working with the ROMP team, these patients would not be able to receive the specialized care they require to return to fully functioning status in their communities.<br/></p>

We raise 100% grassfed beef on a “salad bar” of annual forages crafted for the climate and soils of Santa Cruz County in Southern Arizona. Our calves are born on our ranch in the uplands of the Santa Cruz River. At weaning they are moved five miles to our farm on the Santa Cruz River. Here they live peacefully and naturally on green, grassy forages sustained by irrigation and summer rains. Our cattle live low stress, high quality lives; they are not fed any grains.</p><p></p>
<h3>
</h3><p>We work hard to provide our customers with the best beef we can, but we need to address the long-term sustainability of our enterprise. We have been in business for four years. We have developed and refined our production; and we have met the many challenges of marketing, processing, and storage. We are at a point where the demand for our high-quality, artisanal grassfed beef exceeds our annual production. We've got a ranch, a small cow herd, forage-based bulls, a finishing farm, the necessary skills, and a growing customer base. Now we are ready to expand! </p><p></p><p>
For us, expansion means more cattle, more customers, and eventually a larger farm. We need more quality calves of our own raising and genetics, and more irrigated land to finish them. Available irrigated land in southern Arizona is very hard to come by; we've been searching and will continue to do so. Meanwhile, please help us expand our cow herd and make the taste and nutrition of premium quality, 100% grassfed beef available to more people. </p><p></p>
<h3>The Budget</h3> <p></p>
<p>The money raised from this campaign will go to purchasing heifers to cross with our forage-based bulls so that we can raise more calves for the farm. At the current average price of $1200 per heifer, our budget of $40,000 would allow us to significantly increase the size of our herd.</p> <h3>Why Grassfed?</h3> <p></p>
<p>Compared to conventional beef, grassfed beef is:</p>
<p>1. Better for the environment (less energy goes into growing grass than grain)</p>
<p>2. Better for the beef eater (fewer calories, more healthy omega-3 fats; more antioxidants, beta carotene, vitamins, <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">and minerals)</span></p>
<p>3. Better for the cattle (our methods are more humane; and who wouldn’t be happier standing around in green fields all day?)</p> <h3>Why RSC Grassfed is Better than Other Grassfed in Arizona</h3> <p> </p>
<p>1. <b>We use forage-based genetics</b>. Most modern American beef genetics are focused on weight gain based on grain in a feedlot. Our bulls bring genetics that allow our cattle to thrive on grass and to finish exclusively on growing forages. </p>
<p>2. <b>Our calves feed on a “salad bar” mix of annual forages</b>. We plant, irrigate, graze and maintain a diversity of  annual forages, alfalfa, and perennial rye grass. What we plant and graze changes with the seasons—from  cool to warm to autumnal. This means that our calves are <i>always</i> on green, growing forages.</p>
<p>3. <b>We irrigate</b>. We start irrigating in February, begin grazing in April, and don’t stop either activity until early November. This enables an extended period of grazing green forages­—longer than other Arizona ranches that feed on range grasses and rely on monsoon rains. RSC is located on the Santa Cruz River and the water we <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">use for irrigation seeps back into the water table from which it came. </span></p><h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Thank you for your support!</span></h3><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">We know that budgets are tight (hence this Indiegogo campaign...) and we appreciate your support.

3. We irrigate. We start irrigating in February, begin grazing in April, and don’t stop either activity until early November. This enables an extended period of grazing green forages­—longer than other Arizona ranches that feed on range grasses and rely on monsoon rains. RSC is located on the Santa Cruz River and the water we use for irrigation seeps back into the water table from which it came. Thank you for your support!We know that budgets are tight (hence this Indiegogo campaign...) and we appreciate your support.

<p>I was born and raised in Greece and I am also half Dutch.  I studied ''Sports science &amp; Physical education'' in the Aristotle university of Thessaloniki in Greece and my passions are  Exercise &amp; Nutrition (since I believe these two are inseparable).  I have been training ever since I remember myself. I competed in my hometowns rowing team and also was a national champion in Canoe-Flatwater in my student years..</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3> What led me into writing a motivational exercise book...</h3>
<p>On 2008 I had a big accident which ended up destroying my left leg. What followed was 5 years on crutches, 13 operations, having 4 different external fixators installed in my leg over time, additional health problems and depression.  Before my accident I was pretty lean and muscular but that quickly changed and I ended up losing most of my muscle and becoming overweight. After 13 failing surgeries I understood that my leg wouldn’t be ever fully healed. I had also lost 3 inches of height from my lower leg (tibia bone) which meant I needed to wear shoes with special heels. It not like I didn’t tried… My leg broke 3 times (!) once the bone was fully healed putting my life on hold for something like the 14<sup>th</sup> time… So I took a big decision, to amputate my leg and go on with my life! The surgery was scheduled for after 6,5 months.</p>
<p>So I decided that if I was going to have to be in a good mental state for this surgery I was also going to have to be in good physical shape. As an athlete most of my life I knew the importance of body and mind connection. As a great master once said ‘’To keep the body in good health is a duty… otherwise we shall not be able to keep our mind strong and clear.”~ Buddha</p>
<p>Going to the gym at the time was not an option at the time so I decided I that I would have to make the best out of a workout plan I could perform at home. Although I was really determined I still had my doubts on how effective it would be in comparison with a gym program which was the environment I was used to training mostly in the past … So I sat down on my laptop and made a plan. I thought of all of the best bodyweight exercises, ways to progress into the ones I couldn’t yet perform and variations for the ones that were too easy. I thought of ways I could use stuff like regular home furniture and backpacks turning them into exercise equipment.</p>
<p>After six months of training both my body &amp; mind really hard, researching new ideas on diet and exercise all the work of training hard and a disciplined diet paid off. I was feeling healthier than ever and my body was in great shape, supporting me that way also mentally for the big challenge that I had to overcome.</p>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>Why do I need your help?</h2>
<p>After my surgery I decided organize the training method I created and put in the form of a motivational and instructional book. The reason I need your help is that I want to hire a professional who will put my book in an e-book format so I can upload it for free on my website (which I am also working on at the moment) for the rest of the world who is interested in it</p>
<p>Any extra money I raise will be invested in offering as much free information I can for the following years on my website, youtube channel and maybe making even more e-books.</p>

This has been and will be a long road to recovery.   Here's Vaydas intense story. Thank you</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>         A few weeks ago my sister and mother were in from out of town for my sisters baby shower.  That evening they came over to look at gifts, swim, etc.  I started a fire in  the backyard to help clear out Mosquitos. Right before I went in the house I found a frog and gave it to my other 2 kids(5,7...boys).  My boys, being boys, tried to scare their sister.  She back peddled away from the frog, losing her footing,spinning,falling directly into the fire pit. I had literally walked in the house 10 seconds beforehand.  I was in the house I heard my wife screaming, I look out and she was swooshing my daughter(Vayda) around like crazy In our kiddy pool. I ran out to see what was goin on and my frantic wife raised my daughter out of the pool and her skin was off of her arm and hand and hanging to the ground. Myself, wife, 2 boys, mom and sister were scared to death.</p>
<p>          After a 911 call we ended up at the local hospital, we were then transferred to Detroit Children's Hospital, and thats where the ""medical marvel"" begins.</p>
<p>       The first thing they had to do was get all of her blisters on her leg, both arms and both hands popped, scraped and cleaned. This was 3 hours of pure pain for our Vayda. She was as medicated as she could be for a 2 year old, and the nurses said it was the worst they had a kid react that they had ever seen. That's saying something coming from a children's hospital. The following day they had to clean and scrape it all again because the night before was so dreadful. They had to put her under. When she awoke, she had an adverse (backwards) reaction. Vayda was totally out of control nonstop for 4 hours. Drs could do nothing but wait for the medicine to wear off.  The following day the Drs.  used a different medicine that they use as a backup to ensure no other adverse reactions.  Needless to say she had another adverse reaction, the first time they ever seen a child react like that to that medicine, again for 4 hours.  The following day they had to put her under one more time......</p>
<p>       The Drs found 3 more 3rd degree burns on her leg, they talked to us and decided they were gonna be much quicker so they would use half of both the medicines. So we agreed.  When Vayda awoke this time she was ok at first. The nurse told us she was doing great and we could leave in a day or two to care for her at our home. Seconds later, she lost it again. We had our 5 year old son Max try to calm her down. She fell asleep instantly. My wife and I said good job max!  A few seconds later our nurse returned and was immediately frantic. We thought Max got Vayda asleep. What happened was, she quit breathing.  </p>
<p>       Next thing u know there's every Dr in the hospital in our room, Max and the furniture are pushed out, my wife and I are screaming and shaking her, the Drs are preparing for CPR and x rays, we are at our brink of emotions, then our little angel starts  breathing again!  She had an unusual reaction to the mixed medication. That's when our Dr said "" Vayda you are a medical marvel, you keep doing things we have never seen before day after day""</p>
<p>         <strong>Needless to say Vayda made an impact on every Dr in that hospital every day she was there, and she impacts every person she knows with her feisty personality every day she's home.</strong></p></div>","This is our 2 year old ""medical marvel"" Vayda Ann.

HelpTsiti is a campaign that is designed to help bring family from Zimbabwe here to the United States to take care of my aunt. The letter below is a letter that I have been circulating around trying to bring awereness to something very close to my heart as well as my family and Friends. </span></span></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: Arial, serif;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">To whom it may concern:</span></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: medium; font-family: Arial, serif;"">We are slowly losing one of the most amazing and influential people our lives to a terrible disease, Breast Cancer. Tsitsi (Tee) Mutseta, My aunt, My hero, My role model, My everything. This woman is not only the best friend and sister to my mother, this woman is my mother too. She grew up in a small village in Zimbabwe where the HIV/AIDS epidemic has taken most her village. After graduating high school, she was an unfortunate victim of human trafficking. Taken from her home and brought to America where she worked as slave for three years. After escaping from where she was held, one would think she would have given up on people and life. Instead my aunt went to San Diego State University to become a nurse. She vowed that she was going overcome her misfortunes and she was going to do so by going to college. This would result in giving her the ability to be able to take care of the family she left back in Zimbabwe. While in America she has lost her father and all 4 of her siblings. Leaving her with the responsibility of being mother to 9 children. In 2005, she started a nonprofit organization named Compassion for African Villages. She has been financially and emotionally supporting: 350 children, 200 are orphans, and 8 school teachers. Although the school they attend in Zimbabwe is in disrepair, the children love going. She has been providing the children with uniforms, school supplies and has been paying the 8 teacher’s salaries.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: Arial, serif;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">In April 2007 my mother took my sisters and I to visit my aunt in the nursing group home she worked in at the time. Walking in we were greeted with the smiles and hugs from the older people she took care of. A welcome reflected with love reciprocated from the compassion and care they received from her. My aunt was sitting behind a table with a lot of what I would call schoolwork in front of her. She looked at us and smiled but her smile did not reach her eyes the way it normally would. I immediately knew something was wrong. We sat down and my aunt told us she had been diagnosed with Stage 4 breast cancer. Unrestrained, one by one the tears fell from all of our faces... </span></span></p>

HelpTsiti is a campaign that is designed to help bring family from Zimbabwe here to the United States to take care of my aunt. The letter below is a letter that I have been circulating around trying to bring awereness to something very close to my heart as well as my family and Friends. 
To whom it may concern:
We are slowly losing one of the most amazing and influential people our lives to a terrible disease, Breast Cancer. Tsitsi (Tee) Mutseta, My aunt, My hero, My role model, My everything. This woman is not only the best friend and sister to my mother, this woman is my mother too. She grew up in a small village in Zimbabwe where the HIV/AIDS epidemic has taken most her village. After graduating high school, she was an unfortunate victim of human trafficking. Taken from her home and brought to America where she worked as slave for three years. After escaping from where she was held, one would think she would have given up on people and life. Instead my aunt went to San Diego State University to become a nurse. She vowed that she was going overcome her misfortunes and she was going to do so by going to college. This would result in giving her the ability to be able to take care of the family she left back in Zimbabwe. While in America she has lost her father and all 4 of her siblings. Leaving her with the responsibility of being mother to 9 children. In 2005, she started a nonprofit organization named Compassion for African Villages. She has been financially and emotionally supporting: 350 children, 200 are orphans, and 8 school teachers. Although the school they attend in Zimbabwe is in disrepair, the children love going. She has been providing the children with uniforms, school supplies and has been paying the 8 teacher’s salaries.
In April 2007 my mother took my sisters and I to visit my aunt in the nursing group home she worked in at the time. Walking in we were greeted with the smiles and hugs from the older people she took care of. A welcome reflected with love reciprocated from the compassion and care they received from her. My aunt was sitting behind a table with a lot of what I would call schoolwork in front of her. She looked at us and smiled but her smile did not reach her eyes the way it normally would. I immediately knew something was wrong. We sat down and my aunt told us she had been diagnosed with Stage 4 breast cancer. Unrestrained, one by one the tears fell from all of our faces... 
Tee was in currently in the middle of attending San Diego University to become a nurse. Slowly but surely this disease attempted to rip her dreams from her very hands. But determined and strong willed as she is, she did not give up and shortly after her diagnosis she graduated from San Diego State University. The cancer forced her to stop working as the chemotherapy and cancer began taking its toll. By the grace of God and family and friends who love and cherish her she has been able to keep her apartment and live what some might consider comfortably. 
 While battling this disease, Tsitsi makes beautiful hats and scarfs by crotchet knitting that she sells at Kobey’s Swap meet to raise money for her organization and herself. On top of this she also has several gardens throughout San Diego, the produce from the garden she then sells at several farmers markets. Although the medicine helps ease some of the pain from the cancer, Tee finds a different kind of solace in the gardens. Being in her garden places her back in Zimbabwe, in the land and home she grew up in. The garden has become a form of therapy for Tee and even when the medicine is not easing the pain, the garden does a very great job. Recently due to the nature of her cancer she has been unable to function fully in the garden and do what she loves best. 
This cancer has now taken a hold of her entire body and she is very very sick. Because she cannot go home and see her remaining family, we would like to bring them here to her in America.

<div>Currently, there is lack of awareness of dementia in Ghana and as a result, people with dementia are being stigmatized, rejected, neglected, abused and socially excluded by the society. Also, there is no differentiation between progressive neurological diseases from normal cognitive decline in old age leading to misdiagnosis. In addition, there is limited health facilities and services to assess and diagnose the disease (no appropriate therapeutic interventions or community support services) and this increase the burden of care on their poor families. Further, many suffering from this disease are maltreated, some burnt to death and others sent to witches camps and opened to inhumane treatment. Contributing towards this will help deal with isolation, neglect and abuse of people with dementia in Ghana.  </div>

<p>In 2010 alone, the annual cost of dementia was estimated at US $604 billion.

    Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany (southern Bavaria, near Munich).<br/>
<br/>

    For 18 years I have been working on a medical invention which can
    detect all malignant tumors using a single test. <br/>
<br/>

    There is currently no comprehensive screening test for detection of all malignant
    tumors worldwide.<br/>
<br/>

    The primary function of this invention is to detect aggressive
    malignant tumors at an early stage.<br/>
<br/>

    The German Cancer Research Institute in Heidelberg (DKFZ) reports
    that one out of four people will develop a malignant tumor in their
    lives, and of those 25% are cured.<br/>
<br/>

    A key feature of a tumor marker is so-called sensitivity and
    specificity.  The sensitivity involves the false-negative results in
    percentage terms; the specificity the false positive results.<br/>

    Tumor markers currently on the market can only detect a few types. 
    Furthermore, the sensitivity is low (40-50%) so that they are not
    very reliable cancer detectors.  <br/>

    But on top of that, conventional tumor markers are predominantly
    organ-specific.<br/>
<br/>

    I have discovered an immunological phenomen that can
    identify all malignant tumors using a single test.<br/>
<br/>

    A German State Medical Association has already voted positively on
    the ethics of the tumor detection process, in line with the Helsinki
    “Ethical Principles for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects”
    agreement.  An independent physician has also approved the tumor
    marker.  The hit rate is currently around 97%.  <br/>
<br/>

    The test is fully automated and uses standard blood analysis equipment currently available in hospitals
    worldwide. (These are automated machines that analyse the
    conventional biochemical status of blood tests.)<br/>
<br/>

    The invention does not compete with diagnostic imaging; there is no
    clue as to where the tumor really lies.  It also does not compete
    with clinicians, since its main use is to detect cancer earlier and
    to assist doctors in their diagnosis.  <br/>
<br/>

    The values measured in tests correlate to the level of malignancy. 
    In several tests, it has recognized the body’s response to
    chemotherapy.  Conventional tumor markers react very slowly and are
    not suitable for chemosensitivity diagnosis.  Normally the CT images
    are placed side-by-side in “stagings” where the size of the tumor
    and treatment are compared.  But until now none of these processes
    could detect the really aggressive tumor cells.  <br/>
<br/>

    Doctors and clinics have already expressed an interest in this
    invention but are waiting for a full study or a completed product. 
    <br/>
<br/>

    Here is a quote from Global Business Development Manager, one of the
    largest diagnostic groups in the world:  <br/>
<br/>

    ""You address with your test an interesting question. However, the
    development status of your tests is too early for us to enter into a
    cooperative agreement.  We ask for more extensive validation and
    peer review in scientific journals.”<br/>
<br/>

    Patent protection and, ultimately, the freedom to operate are
    important elements in our process testing.  Idealy, we’re looking
    for:<br/>
<br/>

    a) patent protection, as well as<br/>
<br/>

    b) a completed study, which is broken down into certain tumor types.<br/>
<br/>

    I would therefore like to achieve the following goals with this
    funding request:<br/>
<br/>

    1. Seeking people who will continue to post information on this
    innovation in cancer diagnostics to support the campaign and make
    them known.  I’m looking for donors who would allow me to complete
    research into this process.  <br/>
<br/>

    2. To complete the study, I need about 1500 samples from cancer-free
    subjects, as well as samples from newly diagnosed cancer patients
    who are currently not receiving chemotherapy and have not undergone
    surgery for any types of cancer.  There are opportunities to buy
    blood samples from biobanks. The cost of a meaningful study is
    around € 300,000 ($ 373,000).  I now have the capacity in Garmisch
    to record 500 patient samples a day but need the necessary capital
    to start this phase. <br/>
<br/>

    3. I need at least one scientist who can analyse all biomolecular
    readings.<br/>
<br/>

4. Therefore, I am dependent on private donors who recognize the
    ethical value of this invention for the good of mankind. This is a
    pioneering academic work, which reflects the cancer-fighting
    interests of the healthcare industry.  But to achieve industry-wide
    support, a full study must be carried out that is 100% credible.  <br/>
<br/>

    Patients would greatly benefit from this tumor marker. <br/>
<br/>

    Some documents, statements and scientific evidence by experts are
    published on <a href=""http://www.carcimun.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>www.carcimun.com</u></a>, also in English.<br/>
<br/>

    You can be sure that all donations and support will go into the
    research and development of this test.  I would be very thankful if I only could finish the study with the indiegogo campaign.</p>

<p></p></div>","The Road Back: A Path To Success™                                        A Research and Recognition Initiative to Assist Our Veterans with PTS and Related IssuesThe ProblemEvery year thousands of returning military, state, and local police officers and emergency workers suffer from Post-Traumatic Stress (PTS). PTS is a devastating condition that can destroy lives and despite being “invisible” externally, is as real as a devastating physical wound for those that suffer its disabling effects.

Up to 40% of returning veterans affected with Post Traumatic Stress remain untreated.


Approximately 2 million children have one or both parents in the military and are potentially impacted by PTS.


More than 256,000 veterans who served in Iraq or Afghanistan have been treated for PTS.


 PTS costs Americans more than $15 billion annually.


Current treatment
regimens for US Veterans suffering with PTS have only a 35% success rate.

Conventional
treatment therapies often mandate drug therapy that  only mask the symptoms and can lead to
prescription drug addictions.

We lose more
Veterans to suicide than combat.  We
are losing 22 veterans per day to the ""Silent Killer PTS

<p><b>How many different VIVY garments are available?</b> </p>
<p>The first two VIVY products will be for the back and for the knee, thigh, or upper calf. Back pain and knee pain are two of the most common areas for chronic pain. We are developing additional garments for the shoulder and for smaller limbs like the wrist, elbow, or ankle. These will be available in the future.</p>
<p><b>When will VIVY be available?</b> </p>
<p>At this time, VIVY is an investigational device and is not yet available for sale. We have used our experience of manufacturing clinical diathermy devices to design and build the VIVY prototype and are now finalizing engineering to scale up for manufacturing. We expect VIVY to be available for delivery in Spring 2017, after review and clearance by the US Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA). </p>
<p><b>Is there a time limit I can use diathermy?</b> </p>
<p>A typical treatment session with diathermy will be 20 to 30 minutes in duration. The VIVY session timer can be adjusted from 15 to 30 minutes in 5-minute increments. It can be shut off at any time, but will automatically shut off after the session length is reached. After a treatment session, diathermy should not be used again for at least 2 hours.</p>
<p><b>Where is this used in a clinical setting?</b> </p>
<p>Diathermy is routinely used in physical therapy clinics when the treatment goal involves therapeutic warming, for deep tissue pain relief, muscle relaxation, and tissue repair. In addition to VIVY (intended for consumer home use), we also make a clinical device called REBOUND, which has been used by physical therapy clinics, college athletic departments, and by many professional sports teams. </p>
<p><b>Can I apply VIVY directly against the skin?</b> </p>
<p>VIVY is designed to be used over a thin layer of clothing – a shirt, tee shirt, exercise clothing or jeans, for example – but should not be applied over wet clothing or applied directly to the skin. Using the device over clothing ensures comfort and helps protect the skin from thermal effects.</p>
<p><b>Can VIVY get wet?</b> </p>
<p>As an electronic device, VIVY should not be submerged in water and should not be used when wet. Please consult the instructions for use on recommendations for cleaning VIVY.</p>
<p><b>Can I use VIVY if I have a pacemaker or another metal implant?</b> </p>
<p>Diathermy should not be used by people who have a cardiac pacemaker, implanted defibrillator, deep brain stimulator, spinal cord stimulator, or other metal implants. Even if the device has been removed, if the leads are still in place, the use of deep-heating diathermy could cause the remaining metal to heat up and could pose an internal burn hazard.</p>
<p><b>Who else should not use VIVY?</b> </p>
<p>Children under the age of 18 should not use short wave diathermy, because it may affect bone growth. Pregnant women should not use diathermy. You should also not use diathermy over an active infection site, an open wound, or areas of the body that are numb (thus can’t feel the heat). Diathermy should not be used if you have hemophilia or a blood clotting disorder, or for the treatment of the pelvic area if you have an intrauterine device, or during menstruation. Diathermy should not be used on or near the eyes and should not be used over abruptly swollen joints – wait until the swelling goes down to apply heat therapy.</p>
<p><b>Will VIVY be sold internationally?</b> </p>
<p>We are beginning with the US market but will expand globally based on consumer interest and demand.</p>
<p><b>Have additional questions not shown here?</b> </p>
<p>Please email our team at info@VIVYheals.com and we will respond as soon as possible.</p>

VIVY™ uses technology that relieves pain and promotes healing! This technology, diathermy, has been a standard form of treatment in clinical settings for decades. First discovered by Nikola Tesla and developed by the U.S. Navy, shortwave diathermy uses high frequency electromagnetic waves to transmit heat gently into muscle tissue, the source of your pain, which is a deeper level of heat than provided by heating patches and pads.

This gradual, deep penetrating heat increases blood flow to the area, cleaning out debris and accelerating the healing process. VIVY’s patented technology packs the previously cumbersome clinical application of diathermy into a safe, convenient, and ultra-portable product, intended for over-the-counter use.




This campaign is risk free! After receiving VIVY, try it out for 30 days. If you are not completely satisfied, you can return the device for a 100% refund. Also, if we don't deliver VIVY within 12 months of our campaign ending, we will refund your contribution.
The retail price of VIVY will be $299 for a back garment and $199 for a knee garment, but we're offering significant discounts on the purchase price during this campaign –  up to 50% off retail value.
Join our e-mail list for campaign and product updates by clicking the button below:




More effective than heat patches and more portable than heating pads, VIVY will be the first product to offer the deep heating and healing properties of diathermy in a safe, simple-to-use device. VIVY is small enough to carry anywhere. And unlike patches or pads, VIVY provides heat that penetrates these layers and delivers relief directly to the source of your pain.
Find out more about diathermy from Dr. Cindy Trowbridge, athletic trainer, clinician, researcher, and associate professor at the University of Texas at Arlington:






Simple controls make VIVY easy to use. VIVY is a wraparound garment with velco straps that hold it snugly in place. Built-in sensors will let you know when your session is over.



VIVY provides pain relief so you can get back to being you. Shortwave diathermy uses high frequency electromagnetic waves to transmit heat gently into muscle tissue. VIVY’s heat doesn’t stop short.

In addition to pain relief and faster healing, VIVY’s deep heat can help keep soft tissue and muscles flexible, which leads to improved mobility. A session with VIVY before the gym can jumpstart cold and tense muscles. 

VIVY was designed with portability in mind. Take VIVY with you to the office, gym, and on that weekend getaway. VIVY’s power comes from rechargeable batteries, which free you from being tethered to an AC outlet.  

It’s been proven that shortwave diathermy promotes and accelerates healing. That’s why doctors, physical therapists, professional and collegiate sports teams, and the U.S. Navy Seals use it. And now, with your help, this same technology can be made available as an over-the-counter product.

VIVY makes pain management and healing smarter, easier, and more convenient with a smartphone companion app. You can schedule treatments, track your results after every therapy session, and get useful information and tips. 








Back Garment: 4"" W x 60"" L
Knee Garment: 4"" W x 30"" L

RF Frequency: 13.56 mHz

Duty cycle: 100% (continuous shortwave)

Therapy sessions: 15 min. - 30 min. (5 min. increments)

Power source: Rechargeable 6000 mAh Lithium ion battery pack

Estimated operating time on battery: Up to four 30 min. therapy sessions before charging
Recharge time: 2 hours
Charging connector: Micro USB








We need your help to bring VIVY to market and to build awareness of this innovative approach to pain management. The money generated from the Indiegogo community will help us prepare the prototype for production. Through this campaign, we also hope to educate consumers on the heating and healing powers of diathermy, spread the word about VIVY, and gauge consumer interest and demand for it.  You can help us achieve these goals by sharing this campaign with your family and friends.

We also want to hear your thoughts and questions about VIVY to better understand your needs and wants in pain management. These insights will help us as we move towards manufacturing.




VIVY was created by ReGear Life Sciences LLC, a developer and manufacturer of therapeutic deep heating solutions for management of pain associated with injury and aging. Our products utilize shortwave diathermy technology originally developed by the U.S. Navy to warm SEAL team members and deep sea divers. In the past, we’ve reinvented diathermy technology in the form of portable generators and circumferential heat applicators. Now we are evolving diathermy once again with new coil applicator designs and micro-power requirements, to improve ease of use and effectiveness for consumers.

<p>I have been a herbalist since 1996 and I have engaged in business since 1999. </p>
<p>I've had business partners which made my journey turbulent due to their lack of vision and not being grounded when money and success came, so I opted out of those businesses and went solo January 1st, 2016 with Djehuty Ma’at-Ra Herbs. </p>
<p>While Djehuty Ma’at-Ra Herbs is a corporation with several shareholders, the vision of the company as far as product creation is in the sole hands of myself, which is what I most care about.

<p>In the past two months we have lost two payment gateway accounts (we have several). Ever since 2011, I have experienced losing payment gateway accounts over what makes absolutely no sense to me being outside of the payment gateway industry: excess sales (business) for a new business or start-up, which to this industry is considered suspect and thus high risk. I’ve also lost a few payment gateway accounts due to selling sexual health products too. C’mon! I can’t stop selling sexual nutrients. Sexual health and nutrition are very important.

<p> When I attempted to become a member with the BBB (for prospective customers only, to give them a sense of security with our business), my application was rejected. It was rejected because my metaphysical and energy products did not have worldly or secular scientific evidence of efficacy by worldly scientific bodies who don’t even test energy or vibrational tools or medicine, just like the FDA and pharmaceutical industries do not and will not ever test herbs for their therapeutic efficacy, simply because there is no money to be made in that which cannot be patented by a corporation, unlike with pharmaceutical drugs.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It is impossible to have a non-spiritual entity (a la government) to test a spiritual (or energy) invention for efficacy.

How often would you get rid of a foul smell in your bathroom and get rust and limescale off the toilet bowl?  How much energy would you spend on cleaning? Are you tired of telling your kids to flush the toilet?  Free yourself from these worries - we have developed a compact and affordable automatic toilet flushing device – autoPusher!  </span><div>

<p>Each of us going to the bathroom having an automatic flushing system ever thought that it is so convenient! No unnecessary movements needed, the entire process does not need you to do anything. And I guess you ever thought: 'It would be so great if I had something like that in my home !'. But to mount such a flushing device you will have to spend a lot of energy and money. Besides, the mounting requires displacement of the wall, altering water supply valve system. Moreover, it would cost you 150$ or more, not everyone could afford it. </p>

<p>                                                         There are 3 stages of work:</p>
<p>1 – It detects presence of an object in a 150-170 cm (60 - 67 in) zone.: You come in – autoPusher detects your presence.</p>
<p>2 – It waits until you leave the detection zone.</p>
<p>3 – Have 5 seconds passed after you left the detection zone? – It pushes the flush button. </p>
<p>4 – If the both non-rechargeable and rechargeable batteries are low – the device pushes the button anyway.</p>

<p><span>Q: <span>How long does the rechargeable battery work in a normal mode until recharged?</span></span></p>
<p>A: In a normal mode autoPusher works for 50-60 days until the battery recharged, if it is used by a family of 4-5 members.</p>
<p><span>Q: There are 10 members in my family, how long will the battery work until recharged?</span></p>
<p>A: I<span>n an intensive mode the batteries of 3AA type will work for 30-40 days. The rechargeable battery will work for 60-70 days until recharged.</span></p>
<p><span>Q: I finished using the bathroom but I don't want to wait until the automatic flushing works. What do I do?</span></p>
<p><span>A: For such cases there is a button of compulsory flushing.</span></p>
<p><span>Q: When does the automatic flushing start?</span></p>
<p>A: It starts 5 seconds after you have left the motion detection zone.</p>
<p><span>Q: What is the size of the motion detection zone?</span></p>
<p>A: The motion detection zone's size is 150 cm (60 - 67 in)</p>
<p><span>Q: I have to push my flush button with effort, will autoPusher be able to push it?</span></p>
<p>A: autoPusher has a unique mechanism. Despite its small size we managed to make it able to push a button with 3 kg to 1 cm (approximately 0.39 in) pressure.</p>
<p><span>Testing lasted for months and showed that this pressure effort is enough to push a most 'non-pushable' button.</span></p>
<p>Q: My button consists of two parts. Can autoPusher push it the way set by a manufacturer? Flushing different volumes of water.</p>
<p><span>A: autoPusher's pusher is made of soft material and can adapt to push such kind of button. However, we determined the volume of flushed water by creation of various autoPusher's working scenarios.</span></p>
<p>When you're staying next to autoPusher not for a very long time, the 'fast flushing' scenario works. If you're staying there for long, long pushing scenario works.</p>
<p>Q: Why is a replacement bottle of AutoFresher so small? Does it mean it will be sufficient for not long?</p>
<p>A: autoFresher deodorizes the air only in case you visited the bathroom. This is very effective and saves money. The volume of the replacement bootle will be sufficient for a longer period of time than with similar devices.</p>
<p><span>Q: Where can I buy a replacement bottle for autoFresher? What aromas do you offer?</span></p>
<p>A: For now we can suggest you to buy the autoFresher replacement bottles in our internet shop. Later - in every shop it will be offered in.</p>
<p><span>Currently we discuss with perfume companies the various aromas that will be offered. If you are interested we will consider what you think about it.</span></p>

How often would you get rid of a foul smell in your bathroom and get rust and limescale off the toilet bowl?  How much energy would you spend on cleaning? Are you tired of telling your kids to flush the toilet?  Free yourself from these worries - we have developed a compact and affordable automatic toilet flushing device – autoPusher!  



Each of us going to the bathroom having an automatic flushing system ever thought that it is so convenient! No unnecessary movements needed, the entire process does not need you to do anything. And I guess you ever thought: 'It would be so great if I had something like that in my home !'. But to mount such a flushing device you will have to spend a lot of energy and money. Besides, the mounting requires displacement of the wall, altering water supply valve system. Moreover, it would cost you 150$ or more, not everyone could afford it. 





                                                            Principle of work:   
   

                                                         There are 3 stages of work:
1 – It detects presence of an object in a 150-170 cm (60 - 67 in) zone.: You come in – autoPusher detects your presence.
2 – It waits until you leave the detection zone.
3 – Have 5 seconds passed after you left the detection zone? – It pushes the flush button. 
4 – If the both non-rechargeable and rechargeable batteries are low – the device pushes the button anyway.


 



                                   Easy and flexible mounting on any type of button









                                                    So, what does autoPusher have? 







autoPusher has a battery indicator! It will notify you that it's time to change the non-rechargeable battery or recharge the rechargeable one.




Doubt that it will fit your toilet tank? - The good news is that 90% buttons are made by standard and have the diameter of no more than 50 mm (approximately 0,2 in).



             Meet our 3 versions of autoPusher that will satisfy everyone's needs.


Comfort autoPusher has a PIR-based motion detector on its panel. 



Easy autoPusher has a PIR-based motion detector inside it.



Remote autoPusher has a RF module (radio frequency module) that enables a wireless connection to other devices. It works either with no connection or with a connection to an automatic deodorizing device - autoFresher.

                                 


Meet also a device that works with wireless connection to autoPusher Remote. This is a smart automatic deodorizing device – autoFresher! It deodorizes the air only when it's necessary - after the toilet flushing. 






                                            How does the autoFresher device look?






                                               Built-in flushing  system versus autoPusher. 




                                        Remember you about all version autoPusher








                                  Let us talk about the price of the autoPusher sets:
















autoPusher is registered in ITC (Innovative Technologies Center) (Custom Union)! We forwarded documents for reception of PCT (Patent Cooperation Treaty from WIPO (Wipo). It will protect the copyright for device in 148 countries of the world.  

                                                                     
We take care of energy economy! When autoPusher is idle,it works in the power save mode !






                                                            The goals of fund raising!
1. Starting flow production and distribution around the world! So that everyone can make their life easier!
2. Further development of products for making life more convenient! One of them is a 'Comfortable cat toilet'. For people whose cats use same bathroom as they do.
3. Developing autoPusher and, more specifically, its work in connection with other devices! 
4. Part of the money will be spent on attracting other device manufacturers for modifying autoPusher's appearance


We actively work on development of autoPusher that can be mounted on a tank with water supply valve system.

                                           










                                                         Risks and challenges.
We've given a conservative estimate for our delivery dates. We are committed to keeping you informed of our progress both during and following our campaign. We assure you that we are all working very hard to produce a sensational product that not only arrives on time but is of optimum quality!

                                                                            F.A.Q
Q: In what colours is autoPusher offered?
 A: autoPusher Remote and autoPusher Comfort are offered in 4 colours. These are white, blue, green and red. autoPusher Comfort is offered only in white.


Q: In what colours is autoPusher Limited Edition offered?
A: autoPusher Limited Edition is offered in the listed colours + We can consider your suggestions.




Q: How long does the rechargeable battery work in a normal mode until recharged?
A: In a normal mode autoPusher works for 50-60 days until the battery recharged, if it is used by a family of 4-5 members.
Q: There are 10 members in my family, how long will the battery work until recharged?
A: In an intensive mode the batteries of 3AA type will work for 30-40 days. The rechargeable battery will work for 60-70 days until recharged.
Q: I finished using the bathroom but I don't want to wait until the automatic flushing works. What do I do?
A: For such cases there is a button of compulsory flushing.
Q: When does the automatic flushing start?
A: It starts 5 seconds after you have left the motion detection zone.
Q: What is the size of the motion detection zone?
A: The motion detection zone's size is 150 cm (60 - 67 in)
Q: I have to push my flush button with effort, will autoPusher be able to push it?
A: autoPusher has a unique mechanism. Despite its small size we managed to make it able to push a button with 3 kg to 1 cm (approximately 0.39 in) pressure.
Testing lasted for months and showed that this pressure effort is enough to push a most 'non-pushable' button.
Q: My button consists of two parts. Can autoPusher push it the way set by a manufacturer? Flushing different volumes of water.
A: autoPusher's pusher is made of soft material and can adapt to push such kind of button. However, we determined the volume of flushed water by creation of various autoPusher's working scenarios.
When you're staying next to autoPusher not for a very long time, the 'fast flushing' scenario works. If you're staying there for long, long pushing scenario works.
Q: Why is a replacement bottle of AutoFresher so small? Does it mean it will be sufficient for not long?
A: autoFresher deodorizes the air only in case you visited the bathroom. This is very effective and saves money. The volume of the replacement bootle will be sufficient for a longer period of time than with similar devices.
Q: Where can I buy a replacement bottle for autoFresher? What aromas do you offer?
A: For now we can suggest you to buy the autoFresher replacement bottles in our internet shop. Later - in every shop it will be offered in.
Currently we discuss with perfume companies the various aromas that will be offered. If you are interested we will consider what you think about it.










Most people resigned themselves to facing everyday problems...
But we did not! The 21-th century brings global technologies and at the same time we do not find enough time for doing all we want. You want to find time to do so much and not to waste it to solving domestic problems. This is why while facing everyday problems and worries we just need a helping hand in domestic routine, the one that will provide us with automatic toilet flushing. With the help of our device you will forget about the daily routine of flushing the toilet - it will do everything fot you! I don't ever think about it now, I have more important things to take care of...

Are you tired of using cosmetics and skin care that come in pink bottles and smell like perky bubble gum? Have you ever wanted to support a brand making the kinds of cosmetics and skin care you'd be happy to use? Here's your chance!</p><p>Beautiful Freak Cosmetics is a small goth-oriented cosmetics and skin care company currently making lip scrubs and lip balms. We're now looking to expand to soaps -- since that is what our customers wished for next (we didn't expect this...). However, the challenge with soaps is that making them requires ingredients and supplies we cannot use for any other purpose. That's why we're here on Indiegogo.<br/><br/><u><strong>Who are you creepy people, anyway?<strong><u> </u></strong></strong></u></p><p>Beautiful Freak is made possible through the combined efforts of three friends - two designers in the US (Avril and Kasi), and a writer in Finland (Sonya).  We are old school goths, around for the beginnings in the 80s and 90s.  We're still here now, interested in creating makeup and skincare that appeals to folks in our little corner of the cemetery and perhaps as a reminder that you never have to stop being who you really are -- not at 30, not at 40, not ever.   Avril is also the owner of Club Gothika (the virtual goth club that's been the Greatest Show Unearthed since 2008), under her more familiar name (DJ Bronxelf)  and is also the industrial DJ for Nightbreed Radio, with extensive and deep ties to the goth and industrial music community. She does sets at Gothika 3x a week, plus two monthly shows for Nightbreed.</p><p>BF started out virtually, as a goth cosmetics company in Second Life.  Mostly this was because existing makeup options for goth folks were really limited.  It was frustrating, so we made our own. We named all our products after songs. It became an in-joke to all the real life goth and industrial folks, and everyone knew to look up the names to find the songs they'd never heard before. As a side benefit, a lot of people got exposed to some great music that way, which made us happy.   By the time we stopped producing new content for SL we had a terrific group of incredible supporters.  We are so grateful for all the love and confidence they gave us.  They gave us the opportunity and impetus to keep creating, and become better and more adventurous artists.</p><p>Due to the limitations of the Second Life platform itself, it was time to move on in 2014.  But as the song goes, evil never dies (to save everyone the search, it's a song by Diverje.)  In October of 2016, we rose from the dead to make the leap into the real world with our first test product.  The world did not end, and here we are now, trying to get our third off the ground. </p><p>After creating lip scrubs and lip balms in deliciously dark and decadent flavors (still all named after songs!), we asked our customers what they wanted next and the answer was: soaps! (we *really* didn't expect that...)  That's what this campaign is about -- getting the supplies necessary to make those soaps for you, and to finance the growth of our company so we can continue to keep normalcy overrated.</p><p><strong><u>Cool. So what do we get?</u></strong></p><p>We have several sponsorship levels offering you all the soaps (and lip care) you could possibly need. One of the things we're most excited about is a soap we have planned as a limited edition just for May, in honor of World Goth Day (May 22).   20% of the proceeds from these specific soaps support <a href=""http://sophielancasterfoundation.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Sophie Lancaster Foundation,</a> the charity we have supported extensively for several years' worth of Second Life events.  As of now, there are plans on the table for more charity soaps in June and October, too (different charities, but you get the idea). You won't want to miss these, so throw in a few dollars and make sure to darken the threatening daylight of spring with original, creepy products: made by goths, for everyone.<br/><br/><u><strong>Why crowdfunding?</strong></u><br/><br/>The plain truth is we can't do this without you.   Until now, we've managed to scrape things together without needing to crowdfund our products.  We didn't expect to have to do this yet.  But that's because truly, we did not anticipate the many requests for soap.  We're happy to make whatever people want most in their dark little hearts.  But soaps require a specific, particular investment, and we need crowdfunding support to get it going.  So please, help us make the soaps you asked for. </p><p>The four scents we'll be starting with are two we already have in our product line - Coffee, Sex and Cigarettes, which is a scrubby hazelnut coffee, and Pink Orange Red, a juicy, refreshing blend of cranberry and blood orange.  In addition, we'll be introducing Faded Flowers, a floral containing lavender, vetiver, and lily, and our special for World Goth Day,  Illusion, a mixture of amber, clove and blood orange. We know (believe us) that people want others as well (like our very popular Bitter for Sweet, for example).  But none of this is possible without your help.<br/><br/>The $5- per bar price tag is unique to this campaign. The regular price of the soaps will be $8-.  So whether you get one bar or three, right now, there's a limited number of those $5- bars available.

We're so incredibly grateful to everyone who pitched in and spread the word for us.  As promised, here's our first stretch goal:<br/><br/>If we surpass a total of $900,  we will add in a full size bar of Bitter for Sweet for everyone.  Bitter for Sweet is our insanely popular scrub and balm flavor, that smells like chocolate covered cherries.  People have been asking for it since the campaign began (The reason we didn't lead with it, for the record, was that the coffee in Coffee, Sex and Cigarettes makes for something exfoliating to give us a bit more variety.)  <br/><br/>What's after that?  No idea!  But we'll definitely think of something if we get there. :)   <br/><br/>4/23/17 11:17pm:</p><p>So we had to think of something faster than expected.  Wow.  THANK YOU.  This is amazing.  Okay.  So next stretch goal!  If we hit $1050, we will create a limited edition version of our new LE flavor, Sweet is Evil in soap form.  We hadn't intended on making one, but we will gladly do so for all our wonderful backers!  Sweet is Evil smells like lemon tea, perfect for summer.  Because of the tea, it also gently exfoliates as well, and leaves a fresh lemon scent.</p><p>-----</p><p>Third Stretch Goal!:</p><p>Ok gang, this is as good a time as any to announce the exclusive balm flavor for this campaign.  It's called It Is As Blackness Is, after a song by my favorite industrial band, iVardensphere.

Seriously, thank you all so very much.  Every little bit genuinely helps us.  We started out as small as we possibly could, because we had no idea if anyone would want them at all. We never expected this.  Kasi and I keep looking at the total like 0.0.  (I don't think Sonya even knows yet- she's been buried under another project right now)<br/><br/>It occurred to me that I still had one regular flavor I hadn't offered to make in soap form, so let's do it now.  If we get to $1500, We'll make Sublime Ravings(which is my favorite, so there.) and toss a full size bar into all our supporters' goodie bags. <br/><br/>Sublime Ravings (have I mentioned it's my favorite?) smells like ginger and lime. It also is the world's best creepy cupcake flavor.  Ginger is a natural antibacterial, and this combination will leave you feeling refreshed and wonderful. <br/><br/>In advance, if we meet this goal the next stretch reward is really big (and also contains more charity products).  Let's see if we can get there together.<br/><br/>Keep sharing this as always.

Thank you.   we could not have done it without you and we appreciate all your help so much. <br/><br/>Stretch goal five is a big one.  Basically, if we reach $2000 (we have 20 days left as of this writing so it's doable.) we will donate 20% of the total stretch goal (which is $100 to be clear.) to the <a href=""http://sophielancasterfoundation.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sophie Lancaster Foundation</a> outright.   In addition to that!  We will formulate an exclusive balm and scrub combo to go along with out WGD soap (it will be a little different since amber isn't really something you want to eat) and send the balm and scrub to all our backers. ALSO ALSO, everyone will get a full size version of  our last original regular soap scent -Sugar &amp; Spice, which smells like dark spice cookies, heavy with ginger, cloves and cinnamon.<br/><br/>So please help us reach this next goal, freakbats!

My father and I were overjoyed. A couple of months ago-just before my birthday-I found out horrifying news that my Mom kept a secret from me to protect me.</p>
<p>My Mom now has 4 types of cancer.</p>
<p>Brain Cancer</p>
<p>Lung Cancer</p>
<p>Liver Cancer</p>

<p>This is sad and devastating to my Dad and I. We took care of her, and she fought it so, so hard. The last few months have been rough, but we never gave up hope and faith.</p>
<p>Last week she was not herself. She was breathing heavy and I was very concerned. After trial and error of calling the doctors, they finally said ""Take her to emergency right now!"" My Mom resisted and finally gave in. Getting my Mom who could no longer walk, think, talk, laugh, and now breathe to the hospital was the hardest thing I've ever had to do. I now realize it was my last drive anywhere with my Mommy.</p>
<p>She was so scared, but I kept her calm and rushed her to the emergency room as fast as possible. Talking about vacations we went on, and promising that Jesus Christ is here for us. I know she knows how much I love her and want to take care of her.</p>
<p>The Emergency Room put her on oxygen to help her breathe. For a moment, I saw my Mom smile again like her old self. I was so happy and relieved.</p>
<p>Suddenly the doctors were in panic. She has pneumonia and blood clots in her lungs and it's running through her body. They put her on life support and sedated her.</p>
<p>The doctors told my Dad and I that she is not going to make it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I was the last thing she saw before she closed her eyes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My Mom has always been the greatest Mom in the world to me. Being an only child, I feel blessed to have such a great Mom. I never knew anyone else so caring, loving, and devoted to their son as much as my Mom. She has always been the most positive person I know, and she was always there for me. She loves life and talking to everyone she meets. Always having a great sense of humor even in the toughest situation. She always listened to me, supported me, and gave me uplifting great advice. She was always there for me. She was always amazed by what I've accomplished in my life. She's my greatest supporter. She has given me endless love my entire life that nothing will ever take away from me. No words can describe the special bond I have with her. No words can show how much I love my Mom.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My Mom deserves a proper funeral. She has been through so much in her life. I owe it to her to respect her wishes and give her a nice tomb stone.</p>
<p>I don't know how much time I have left.</p>
<p>My Dad and I are desperate and helpless. This week was worse than I thought it would be. We are devastated. We are confused. We need help fast.</p>
<p>I'm not asking you to donate. I'M BEGGING YOU! PLEASE help my family during this horrible time in our lives. I will pitch in as much as I can, but it's not enough. I know how much funerals cost from my wonderful Grandfather passing away 2 years ago, and we simply cannot afford it.

hopping on one leg. She had taken me and my cousin grocery shopping with her,
and as is typical with younger children, we had subsequently become bored. So,
we concocted several contests to perform amongst ourselves, all in an attempt
to entertain ourselves. One was to see how long we could walk on our heels,
with the object being to be the one who walked longest. One had been to see who
could hold their breath the longest. And one, well, it had been to see who
could go the longest without putting their second foot down. So for almost a
minute my mother pushed a shopping cart down the aisle, closely followed by two
hopping adolescents. That is, until she turned around and yelled at us to stop
hopping on one leg, as it might cause us some kind of “irreversible damage.”
Yes, when I was eight, my mother yelled at me to stop hopping on one leg. Now,
13 years later, hopping on one leg is my way of life. </p><p>

I took a job working for a recycling plant in Orlando, FL , when I was 19 years
old. It was an awesome job for a young adult with hardly any college under his
belt, as it paid $9 an hour for forty hours a week, plus typically an
additional 20 hours of overtime, and it also gave me a chance to do “a real
man’s work,” something I had desired for a long time. I was lead baler, and in
a nutshell my job was to run the baling machine and subsequently make all the
bales that we sold, thereby singlehandedly providing the source of income for
the company. My boss’s exact words had been, “John, the speed and quality of
your work directly correlates with how much money this company makes, as we
only make money from bales, and you are the lead person making them.” It was a
lot of responsibility, and for me, well, that was pretty cool. Around early
June my company started up a night shift and I was tasked to work it. This
meant working half the shift in a full plant, with managers and supervisors
around, but then the remaining half the shift under no supervision whatsoever.
It would be just me and my two crew members. It brought with it a sense of
prestige as it meant I had proved myself enough that they trusted me to work
without anyone breathing down my neck. This prestige was short lived. </p><p>

July 9th 2010, around 7:15pm, my baling machine became jammed. After
working on clearing the jam for a few minutes, I managed to unclog the machine
when suddenly I heard the motors kick on. Before I could do anything, the compacting
ram began moving towards me. I quickly jumped up and pulled myself out of the
way of the moving ram, holding my body up and hovering over the moving piece of
heavy machinery. Unfortunately, my right boot was not up far enough and the ram
managed to catch it by the very bottom of my boot’s sole. Pulling me back down
and onto the top of the ram, it pulled my leg closer and closer to the teeth,
until it disappeared out of sight. Suddenly a splitting pain shot up my leg as
I felt my foot get crushed all the way up to my shin. At this point, my leg
became severed. I pulled myself up and out of the machine, and radioed for
help. Suddenly, not having an entire plant full of coworkers was no longer a
cool thing, as no one heard my screams. Grabbing my cell phone, I dialed 911
myself. At 7:23pm the Orange County Police Department answered the phone and
thus began the longest 16 minutes of my life as I fought to stay alive long

used to be, but at the same time it’s nothing the same. When you put on your

<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal;"">September 7, 2010 started
out as normal as any other day. I got up early and dragged myself into an 8
a.m. class at the University of Louisville. On the way home from class I
stopped to help a lady with a flat tire. While helping change the tire, I was
suddenly struck by a reckless driver. As the vehicles slid to a stop I tried to
gather my thoughts. I had no clue what had just happened or the extent of my
injuries.  After regaining my bearings, I knew I was in trouble but I was
still alive.  One after the other, people began stopping their cars and
rushing out to help us.  God blessed me and those around me that day. As
people began to help, I realized very rapidly that my guardian angel was over
me that day. People who stopped to help me that day included a UPS Airline
Pilot, a nurse (also the wife of one of the worship leaders at my church), a
past youth minister, the lady I was helping (now my Aunt Janet), and the lady
that hit my truck. During the next 42 days at the University of Louisville
Hospital I had 11 major surgeries, plenty of sleepless nights, weeks without an
appetite, and more than my fair share of pain, both physically and
emotionally.  As is the case with many people who go through traumatic
situations in their lives, I began to appreciate all the great things that happened
to me as a part of this experience - I bonded with my fiancée who I have been
with for about 2 1/2 years, got closer to most of my family and friends than
ever before, and met some amazing people such as nurses, doctors, lawyers,
athletes, and many many others that really exemplified the greatness of the
human spirit.  I have changed the way I look at the world and feel that my
priorities have changed too.  My goal now is to help change the outlook
that other amputees have on their own limbs. I sincerely want to help make
those other amputees feel confident in who they are and how others perceive
them.<br/><br/>
Update: One of the greatest accomplishments for
myself since my accident was just recently when I was able to propose to my
girlfriend of two and a half years in traditional fashion by getting down on
one knee. You can see the proposal in my picture above!<span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: ""Times New Roman"",""serif"";'></span></p>

What
is a Fairing and what is an Amp?
A Fairing is…
a specialized covering that
surrounds an existing prosthetic leg, accurately recreating the body form
through a process that uses three-dimensional scanning and printing. I first
encountered this product at the Amputee Coalition's national conference in Kansas
City in June at the Bespoke Innovations booth. They are the coolest and most
necessary prosthetic items I have come across since I lost my leg and was very
disappointed to learn they weren’t covered by insurance.
 
An Amp is….
simply an Amputee.
 
Why is this so important to F4A?
There are thousands of amputees in
America whose lives would improve overnight by receiving a prosthetic fairing.
Our goal is to provide these fairings to as many amputees worldwide as
possible, starting first at home and spreading our reach out as we go. To do so
we need everyone's help spreading the word about what we are doing. That means

past youth minister, the lady I was helping (now my Aunt Janet), and the lady
that hit my truck. During the next 42 days at the University of Louisville
Hospital I had 11 major surgeries, plenty of sleepless nights, weeks without an
appetite, and more than my fair share of pain, both physically and
emotionally.  As is the case with many people who go through traumatic
situations in their lives, I began to appreciate all the great things that happened
to me as a part of this experience - I bonded with my fiancée who I have been
with for about 2 1/2 years, got closer to most of my family and friends than
ever before, and met some amazing people such as nurses, doctors, lawyers,
athletes, and many many others that really exemplified the greatness of the
human spirit.  I have changed the way I look at the world and feel that my
priorities have changed too.  My goal now is to help change the outlook
that other amputees have on their own limbs. I sincerely want to help make
those other amputees feel confident in who they are and how others perceive
them.
Update: One of the greatest accomplishments for
myself since my accident was just recently when I was able to propose to my
girlfriend of two and a half years in traditional fashion by getting down on
one knee. You can see the proposal in my picture above!
What
We NeedThere are thousands of amputees in
America whose lives would improve overnight by receiving a prosthetic fairing.
Our goal is to provide these fairings to as many amputees worldwide as
possible, starting first at home and spreading our reach out as we go. To do so
we need everyone's help spreading the word about what we are doing. That means
that we would really appreciate all of your shares, likes, and tweets which
will help us get some attention and hopefully more donations for our wonderful
purpose and organization. Genuinely, thank you very much for each of those
shares, likes, and tweets. Each one has such a great potential to bring so much
to those we hope to help.
To accomplish our mission we need to
receive about $4000 in donations for each amputee we assist. This means that we
need all of your help you can give donating as well as doing all of the
tweeting and tagging possible to make sure we are spread all across Facebook,
Twitter, Indiegogo, LinkedIn, wherever possible! Thanks so much for continuing
to support us and we appreciate both your time and your money and how you are
choosing to put it towards such a great cause with our organization!
Finally, I will personally say, for those that are curious, that I
was not asked by Bespoke or any other company that makes prostheses to do this.
I simply feel that I can make a difference in many amputees’ lives by helping
them get these Fairings that have such huge emotional benefits.  I am
excited to start this campaign and am truly grateful for any donations you make
to help me and other amputees.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Dear Friends,

This is a heartfelt, personal appeal to ask you to help a little girl in Thailand who has lost her eyes to cancer.
Her name is Pun Pun.  She is only eight months old. 

I met baby Pun Pun's mother during a recent trip to Bangkok.  Her name is Patcharee.  She is a buffet server in the hotel where I stay on my many trips there.  She is trying to help her daughter on meager wages and without the help of her husband, who has abandoned the family: Patcharee, baby Pun Pun and another daughter, who is eight years old.

Imagine being a poor single mom struggling to support two little girls, one of whom has just had her eyes removed and now needs chemotherapy. 

Fortunately, baby Pun Pun's bilateral retino blastoma was detected early. She has an excellent chance of survival with the proper treatment and care. But she will be blind the rest of her life.

Because Patcharee could not afford hospital care in Bangkok, she had to take Pun Pun to Chaing Mai, a 12-hour bus trip to the north.  Patcharee is now commuting between her part-time hotel job in Bangkok and the hospital in Chaing Mai  where Pun Pun awaits chemotherapy.

My goal is to raise money for Patcharee so that she can be by baby Pun Pun's side throughout the chemotherapy process without having the additional stress of working and traveling so that she can provide for her older daughter, herself and baby Pun Pun's growing expenses.

As baby Pun Pun is now surrounded by complete darkness, she needs her mother there every hour of every day and night - if for nothing else then to sense her mother's presence, hear her voice and the comfort of her touch during this frightening and tumultuous time in her young life. With your help, we know we can improve the quality of baby Pun Pun's life. Mother and daughter should not be separated at such a crucial time. 

Pun Pun and her mother have captured my heart, as I'm sure they have captured yours.  Won't you help them get through this ordeal and give baby Pun Pun and Patacharee hope for a better future?

It's in our hands to help. Any donation your able to make is greatly appreciated. Thank you for your support!

<h3>INTRO</h3>
<p>My name is Dr. Eden Goldman and I've got a secret to tell you.  Actually, I've got a whole book of secrets to tell you.  My new book <strong><em>THE SECRET ART OF ADJUSTING YOGA POSES</em></strong> is an awesome, heart-inspired project that I've been working on for the last year and have been dreaming about doing since I first began teaching Yoga over a decade ago.  The best part is, I get to share this work and these secrets with all of you here on IndieGoGo and I have until 12/12/12 to do it!  O:-)<br/><br/><br/></p>
<h3>ABOUT THIS PROJECT</h3>
<p>My book, <em>The Secret Art of Adjusting Yoga Poses</em>, is an easy to follow step-by-step guide that introduces masterfully refined hands-on techniques for assisting more than 50 Yoga poses!  With beautiful photos and detailed descriptions, it's a book that every Yoga instructor and serious practitioner of Yoga will want to own.  As a Chiropractor and a lifelong yogi, I'm sharing this valuable information to artistically bring together both the Eastern world of the healing arts and the Western world of biomechanical sciences and sports medicine.  I feel (like so many others) that adjustments and assists is a major area of need in the Yoga community and decided it was time to do something about it.  <br/><br/>Inside the book, I discuss Yoga asana adjustments for a variety of skill levels from beginner to advance as well as assists for different types of bodies.  Bigger, smaller, wider, taller...you name it!  Just like using any other tool, knowing which assist to apply when and on what type of body can transform the experience for both the practitioner AND the Yoga teacher into something that is profoundly inspiring, deeply connecting and sacred.  Some poses in the book even have as many as 7-8 different techniques.  I can wholeheartedly guarantee that you will learn something new!  My intention in sharing this with you is to keep people safer when giving and receiving asana assists so that everyone enjoys Yoga more.  In this way, I hope my book is of huge benefit to Yoga practitioners and teachers all across the world.<br/><br/><br/></p>

<p> </p>
<p>My dear friend Ed has been in Ocala Regional Medical Center in Ocala, Florida (where Ed has lived for the last 7 years) for almost 60 days, and of those 60 days over 45 of them have been in the ICU. As you can imagine his medical bills are Astronomical!!!   This past week, in order to get the infection under control, the doctors had to make the tough call to amputate his right leg all the way up to his hip. They did the surgery on Saturday (July 21st) and he is in good spirits. His mother has been by his side in Florida for much of this time (flying back and forth between Pittsburgh and Florida), however, she is going to be returning to Pittsburgh this weekend due to her responsibilities here. She will continue to fly back and forth as needed but this too is an added expense. They would love to bring him back to PA for rehabilitation but without insurance this seems impossible!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I am trying to raise enough money for him to be transported back home to Elizabeth, PA where he can be with his family and rehabilitate.  The reason I want to help bring Ed back to Elizabeth, PA is because all of his family is here.  His mother, father as well as his brothers and sisters all still live in his hometown.  He will get all the emotional support he needs from having them nearby but will still need financial help.  Getting him home to Elizabeth is the first step, but I would also like to try and help defray the cost of the hospital bills as well as the cost of his rehabilitation, which are/will be insurmountable. He still has a very, very long road ahead of him and he is very weak.  His medical care will not stop with him healing from the amputation but he will now need either a prosthetic leg or a wheelchair - neither of which are cheap.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ed has helped so many in our community of Elizabeth, PA.  For those of you who do not know - he was the manager of Grower's Exchange for almost 30 years and gave so many of us our first jobs. Ed has always been very supportive of his community and contributed to various fundraisers while living in Elizabeth, PA.  He was also the police commissioner for Forward Twp. for two terms.</p>

<p>I know times are tough for everyone, anything you can contribute will be greatly appreciated. And if you can't contribute monetarily, please help spread the word anyway you can, or just say a prayer.</p>

I am a 33 year old single mother, and I am also not the type to ask for help, as I prefer to be self-sufficient...But sometimes we all need to give a little help, and sometimes we all need to get a little help.
People who have known me a while know I was in an abusive relationship a few years back.

However, there are some I've not been able to even get started, and now I've reached a point where the issues have become a serious health risk.
I used to smile and laugh without reservation quite frequently. Friends used to catch me grinning at them and making funny faces, just because.  That hasn't really been true in recent years.  Oh, I still laugh, but I also cover my mouth nearly every time.  When I left my ex, he got a couple punches to my jaw line before I got out the door.  Those parting shots shattered most of my molars, and cracked several other teeth.

I'm at a point where I have tried all avenues presented to me and have not quite been able to meet the financial goals I need to meet to get this done.  I guess, when it comes down to it, I'm hoping that all the help I've given over the years comes back to me.<br/><br/></span></p>

<p><a href=""http://tinyurl.com/m4my6aj"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The 34-year old heart of our ranch, a 600-foot deep well, unexpectedly failed this spring. It was heartbreaking to watch our grass pastures and hay crops die. Instead of our 89 bison grazing in fields of mixed natural forage, we now must feed them a ton of hay each day. At $200/ton, our expenses have tripled. <br/><br/>We desperately need to replace the original well’s casing, or have a new well drilled. Having already exhausted our life savings just to get to this point, there is simply no way for us to pay for this work. This is a “make-or-break” situation. Unless we can raise the funds, we will be forced to sell our beloved animals. We will lose a way of life we have worked for years to establish, and 100% grass-fed bison meat will become unavailable to loyal customers like you – our friends and family. </a><a name=""ret"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>

<p>After years of research, but with no agricultural experience, we invested our life savings to become humane, 100% grass-fed bison ranchers. Ten years ago, we were the first to introduce this clean, healthy red meat into Los Angeles area farmers markets. While still living in Southern California, we commuted 1,200 miles every 11 days to our 225-acre bison ranch in Lassen County, located in northeast California. One year ago, we moved to the ranch full-time.<a name=""OM"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a></p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><b>OUR MISSION:<br/>Why what we‘re doing is important.</b></h3>
<p>Because of the deep caring we have for our customers, our grass-fed bison, and our land, we found – ununwittingly – that we provide a unique point, a ""reconnect,"" for each to connect with the other. A disconnect between people and their food has existed for many years, encouraged by commercial food distributors and promoted as “convenient.” That has finally, thankfully, started to change. While there may be little that is convenient about what we do, our customers bypass the “convenience” of the nearest supermarket, choosing instead to reconnect with the source of their food by driving to the farmers markets where we sell. And we are there, finding the same caring reconnect with them.</p><p></p>

<p></p>
<p></p>In comparison, many traditional ranchers take their animals to the sale barn every fall and consider themselves done. Very few work their ranch, humanely care for their animals, and then go on to promote and sell directly to individual customers, educating them why their food dollar is important and well placed with small, ethical farmers like us. It’s hard work and it requires commitment far beyond just making a living.<br/><br/>For us, this wonderful reconnect has become a labor of love and a learning privilege. By inviting others to reclaim and become part of the sustainable life cycle that Nature intended, we regularly renew and strengthen our personal commitment to the animals and the earth. We do this by respectfully raising our bison 100% on grass, without drugs, chemicals, or grain, while restoring a heritage animal to an area where they were once were native. Most people are unaware that 80% of all bison are shipped to feedlots, even some which may be marketed as “grass-fed.” We don’t think that’s right, nor do our increasingly aware customers.<p> </p>

<p></p><p>In summer, our bison graze on pastures of native grasses, forbes and legumes (no GMOs); in winter they eat hay (dried grass). Drawing from a healthy aquifer below, our well provides cool, clean irrigation water for biodiverse pastures and hay crops. Not only is a new well vital to securing bison’s tenuous foothold here, it will help send a message that small farmers like Lindner Bison can keep moving forward with confidence. We want to pass the ranch on intact to the next generation of caring grass-fed bison producers.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><b>OUR FUTURE: Once water is restored</b></h3>
<p></p>
<h4>Year 1 (2014).</h4><p>With
the water back on by April, we can start to reseed our biodiverse, non-GMO, pasture grasses and hay ground, as well as establish additional paddocks for rotational grazing</p>

<blockquote>Year 1 – Reseeding biodiverse pasture grasses and hayground<br/>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>Early spring seeding and irrigation will provide new pasture grasses and biodiverse grass hay for winter. While pastures become established, we will feed purchased hay; if we’re very lucky, it may be possible to briefly allow grazing in the fall.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<h4>Year 2 (2015).</h4>With pastures once again lush and green and full of forage, we can fully resume rotational grazing by summer!

<p>A chicken tractor (we call it the ‘chicken jet’), made with repurposed unusable pipe, stands by. Inside, 12 heritage chickens are waiting to follow the bison through the pasture, naturally distributing manure and helping to control flies, a la the Joel Salatin model. This kind of closed-loop farming makes our ranch and our animals healthier and even more sustainable. </p>

<h4><b>If we are fortunate enough to exceed our funding goal<br/></b></h4>
<ul>
<li>Excess funds will go toward purchasing grass hay during 2014. 2013 hay prices are $200/ton; our herd eats about one ton every day.</li>
<li>Rotational grazing paddocks may be extended by enclosing another 40 acres with game fencing and replacing wheel lines with K-line irrigation pods. This will provide the best grazing/recovery rate once water is fully restored to the land.</li>

<hr/><h3 style=""text-align: center;""><b><br/></b></h3><h3 style=""text-align: center;""><b>OUR CORE VALUES</b></h3>
<p>Lindner Bison practices ethical food production through humane animal husbandry without drugs or chemicals. We use food grade diatomaceous earth for worming and protection against insects. Instead of letting thirsty wild animals drown in the bison's stockwater tank, we provide critter ramps so that 'visitors' can safely get back out should they happen to fall in. By preventing animal drowning, this simple approach avoids having to add antibiotics to the drinking water to protect bison against bacteria in decaying carcasses.<br/></p><p>Lindner Bison are dedicated advocates of non-GMO, heirloom and heritage species. We oppose genetically engineered plants and animals. We empower ourselves and others by staying current on global events and reports surrounding GMOs, sharing news via our Facebook page and in person. At the local level, we give back to our community by providing educational ranch tours. We're also privileged to be working with stakeholders to help establish a community food garden. During winter months, Ken plays in the local symphony orchestra.

Click here to listen to the January 4, 2014 interview by Laura Avery on KCRW's good food (interview starts at 50:00 minutes) or click here for the short version.
The Lindners received a wonderful Christmas gift in the form of a check for a substantial fraction of the cost to rebuild the well. They received additional personal checks and contributions at the Farmers Markets. This means we are only about $5K shy of the funding goal!
Now we need you more than ever! Please help by spreading the word and by donating (again) if you can. While big donors are wonderful, the Lindners depend on their loyal customers to show them that they care enough to make this happen!

Costumers turned volunteers set up an fundraising stand at the Hollywood Farmers Market on January 6.
Thank you for your support!

WATER FOR BISON
We believe in the preservation of small
family ranching, humane animal husbandry and the return of a heritage animal - the North American Bison - to the West. We believe in providing clean, healthy food directly to customers, without the use of chemicals, antibiotics, or genetically modified organisms (GMOs). This is our mission.
We invite you to join the effort to save our small ranch and preserve the environment
for a family group - including 40 new calves - of North American Bison by donating for the repair or
replacement of our irrigation water well. Without your help, both our ranch and bison family group will cease to exist.
A new irrigation well is urgently needed to restore water to our 100% grass-fed bison ranch! 

Above: The well failed unexpectedly in April, 2013, leaving parched, barren land.Below: With your contribution, we can turn the fields back to a green and lush pasture for the bison.



Without water, the ranch is dying.

OUR NEED: $150,000
The well failed - we will lose our bison - we desperately need water.
The 34-year old heart of our ranch, a 600-foot deep well, unexpectedly failed this spring. It was heartbreaking to watch our grass pastures and hay crops die. Instead of our 89 bison grazing in fields of mixed natural forage, we now must feed them a ton of hay each day. At $200/ton, our expenses have tripled. We desperately need to replace the original well’s casing, or have a new well drilled. Having already exhausted our life savings just to get to this point, there is simply no way for us to pay for this work. This is a “make-or-break” situation. Unless we can raise the funds, we will be forced to sell our beloved animals. We will lose a way of life we have worked for years to establish, and 100% grass-fed bison meat will become unavailable to loyal customers like you – our friends and family. 

Please help us restore life-giving water by donating to WATER FOR BISON!
You can contribute via PayPal of via Credit Card. PayPal donations are available instantaneously, while donations via credit card will only be released to us at the end of the campaign. Nevertheless, we welcome which ever mode of payment is easier for you!

BACKGROUND
An Oberlin graduate with a teaching degree, Ken rose to the level of Vice President of Quality Assurance in the fields of biomedical and medical manufacturing, implementing ISO standards and working closely with federal regulatory agencies. A proud Montana native, Kathy is named after her legendary great-grandmother, Margaret Carlston, who became known as “the Cattle Queen of Montana”. She has worked for corporate executives in investor relations, marketing, advertising and telecommunications. For both, most of their employment history was spent in Fortune 500 or 100 companies. 
    

After years of research, but with no agricultural experience, we invested our life savings to become humane, 100% grass-fed bison ranchers. Ten years ago, we were the first to introduce this clean, healthy red meat into Los Angeles area farmers markets. While still living in Southern California, we commuted 1,200 miles every 11 days to our 225-acre bison ranch in Lassen County, located in northeast California. One year ago, we moved to the ranch full-time.

OUR MISSION:Why what we‘re doing is important.
Because of the deep caring we have for our customers, our grass-fed bison, and our land, we found – ununwittingly – that we provide a unique point, a ""reconnect,"" for each to connect with the other. A disconnect between people and their food has existed for many years, encouraged by commercial food distributors and promoted as “convenient.” That has finally, thankfully, started to change. While there may be little that is convenient about what we do, our customers bypass the “convenience” of the nearest supermarket, choosing instead to reconnect with the source of their food by driving to the farmers markets where we sell. And we are there, finding the same caring reconnect with them.


       

Caption: Left: Reconnecting land, bison and customers at the farmers market. Right: Our bison on pasture their entire lives, just as Nature intended.



In comparison, many traditional ranchers take their animals to the sale barn every fall and consider themselves done. Very few work their ranch, humanely care for their animals, and then go on to promote and sell directly to individual customers, educating them why their food dollar is important and well placed with small, ethical farmers like us. It’s hard work and it requires commitment far beyond just making a living.For us, this wonderful reconnect has become a labor of love and a learning privilege. By inviting others to reclaim and become part of the sustainable life cycle that Nature intended, we regularly renew and strengthen our personal commitment to the animals and the earth. We do this by respectfully raising our bison 100% on grass, without drugs, chemicals, or grain, while restoring a heritage animal to an area where they were once were native. Most people are unaware that 80% of all bison are shipped to feedlots, even some which may be marketed as “grass-fed.” We don’t think that’s right, nor do our increasingly aware customers. 
    

Caption: Left: Bison were native to NE Calif. in the 1500s. Right: 80% of all bison are shipped to feedlots, even some which may be marketed as ""grass-fed."" We don’t do that!

In summer, our bison graze on pastures of native grasses, forbes and legumes (no GMOs); in winter they eat hay (dried grass). Drawing from a healthy aquifer below, our well provides cool, clean irrigation water for biodiverse pastures and hay crops. Not only is a new well vital to securing bison’s tenuous foothold here, it will help send a message that small farmers like Lindner Bison can keep moving forward with confidence. We want to pass the ranch on intact to the next generation of caring grass-fed bison producers.

OUR FUTURE: Once water is restored

Year 1 (2014).With
the water back on by April, we can start to reseed our biodiverse, non-GMO, pasture grasses and hay ground, as well as establish additional paddocks for rotational grazing

 
Year 1 – Reseeding biodiverse pasture grasses and hayground


Early spring seeding and irrigation will provide new pasture grasses and biodiverse grass hay for winter. While pastures become established, we will feed purchased hay; if we’re very lucky, it may be possible to briefly allow grazing in the fall.


 Feeding hay continues so the new grass can become established.



Year 2 (2015).With pastures once again lush and green and full of forage, we can fully resume rotational grazing by summer!

A chicken tractor (we call it the ‘chicken jet’), made with repurposed unusable pipe, stands by. Inside, 12 heritage chickens are waiting to follow the bison through the pasture, naturally distributing manure and helping to control flies, a la the Joel Salatin model. This kind of closed-loop farming makes our ranch and our animals healthier and even more sustainable. 
  Caption: Our chicken tractor (aka the “chicken jet”), with 12 heritage chickens ready to follow the bison.  


If we are fortunate enough to exceed our funding goal

Excess funds will go toward purchasing grass hay during 2014. 2013 hay prices are $200/ton; our herd eats about one ton every day.
Rotational grazing paddocks may be extended by enclosing another 40 acres with game fencing and replacing wheel lines with K-line irrigation pods. This will provide the best grazing/recovery rate once water is fully restored to the land.
Caption: Our herd eats about a ton of hay a day, at $200/ton. This is what 50 tons of hay looks like.

OUR CORE VALUES
Lindner Bison practices ethical food production through humane animal husbandry without drugs or chemicals. We use food grade diatomaceous earth for worming and protection against insects. Instead of letting thirsty wild animals drown in the bison's stockwater tank, we provide critter ramps so that 'visitors' can safely get back out should they happen to fall in. By preventing animal drowning, this simple approach avoids having to add antibiotics to the drinking water to protect bison against bacteria in decaying carcasses.Lindner Bison are dedicated advocates of non-GMO, heirloom and heritage species. We oppose genetically engineered plants and animals. We empower ourselves and others by staying current on global events and reports surrounding GMOs, sharing news via our Facebook page and in person. At the local level, we give back to our community by providing educational ranch tours. We're also privileged to be working with stakeholders to help establish a community food garden. During winter months, Ken plays in the local symphony orchestra.

A trait that spread throughout the other patience like a wildfire.The doctors where able to remove the cancer and save the leg.  We all breathed a great sigh of relief.A short time later, tumors and blood clots where found.  The battle was not over.After more treatment, no progress was made in reducing the tumors or the blood clots.In early March, Abi was admitted to the hospital after feeling faint, dizzy, and disorientated.   Fearing a possible stroke, the doctors took a look and found additional tumors in her brain.  These new tumors, in addition to the blood thinners was causing bleeding in the brain.She is back on radiation treatment and she remains her upbeat, cheerful self through it all.At the time this is being written, Abi is at home with family, friends, and loved one.  Her attitude has not changed.  Ever a smile on her face, always a laugh, and ever the spark that made her such a great sister, daughter, and friend to us all.All she wants from us, is for us to be happy for her.  It may seem like an odd request, but if you know Abi, you would not be surprised.Now I have a simple request for you.  Please donate. Abi has found peace.  Please assist us in helping her and her family find financial peace.  The words I have written here do not even scratch the surface of the love I have for this family, nor the strength they have and continue to teach me. Even if you cannot give please share this with as many people as you can!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><b>Dear Family and Friends,</b></p>
<p>Kalidas (aka Tyler) and I are happy to share our special news with you all. We're expecting! And we'd like you to be a part of this special experience!</p>
<p>When we first <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">found out I was pregnant we both agreed that a natural birth was the best way to bring our child into the world. At first, I was hesitant to not receive major support from my health insurance by choosing a home birth, but we both agreed that our ideals would be met if we chose the natural route. The importance of inviting this soul into the world through a peaceful, loving, and supportive environment at home is high on our list.</span></p>
<p>Through your loving support in any way possible, we know that this goal can and will be achieved.</p>
<p>We feel so much love at this time for each and everyone of you as we prepare to be parents. I truly feel my heart expanding as I prepare for motherhood. We are blessed to be experiencing this miracle of life in our family and we're grateful to be sharing it with you.</p>

<p>This campaign was suggested by a friend who knew that we needed help raising our monthly midwife fees. <br/></p>
<p><b>Here's the plan:</b></p>
<p>Our goal is to be able to reach the $3,600+ fee that pays our 2 midwives-- Jessica and Melanya from Grass Valley, CA. We've paid about half of this already and could use your help to chip off the rest. Jessica &amp; Melanya have been meeting with Kalidas and I monthly for prenatal care. They will also be guiding us through labor and birth at our home, and postpartum care after the baby is born. </p>
<p>Even if we don't reach the entire goal, every dollar will have helped pay towards supporting the life of our new born baby.<br/></p>
<h3>Our Midwives</h3>
<p>Jessica &amp; Melanya are not only our midwives, but dear friends in our local community. They use the utmost care and respect for each couples' beliefs, ideals, and choices when preparing for birth. They also delivered babies for some of our friends.</p>

We've started shipping our first Tempdrops and it's all thanks to your support and belief! Last week we sent out an email asking  all of our Indiegogo backers to confirm their email address (if you did not receive the email, check under other folders or spam). We want to make sure that you get your Tempdrop and get it FAST! So if you haven't yet, please send us your current shipping address to  contact@temp-drop.com and we'll ship your Tempdrop right away!Only confirmed addresses are sent first.Can't wait to finally ship Tempdrop your way!Best,The Tempdrop team ""This is not the end, my friend"" 
We are moving forward with Tempdrop, and Pre-orders are available atwww.Tempdrop.xyz
Please join our mailing list if you wish to be informed Quit Charting, Live ON !Tempdrop™ is the first  Smart sensor that makes fertility tracking simple, safe, accurate, and available for everyone. 
Important notice: Although this is a flexible funding campaign. If we will not reach our goal, WE WILL REFUND anyone who has ordered a Tempdrop™ device and will want his/her money back. This campaign is not for making money, it's for making a change. (M.V)
 Coverage on Tempdrop™: Simple 

Put the sensor on before you go to sleep.  It will continuously monitor your sleep and accurate body temperature. 


Take it off when you wake up. It will automatically integrate its readings into your favorite fertility app.

No charging or battery replacement required.
Use our adhesive patches for the most accurate readings. You can also use our dedicated armband for a ""lighter"" feel, or you may even tuck the sensor under your bra strap (under the armpit). Just make sure you stick to one method.
 Safe 
No wireless transmission when you wear the device - Although we use Low Energy Bluetooth for communicating with your smartphone, we think it is important that you feel comfortable wearing Tempdrop™ every night. Therefore, we've made extra efforts to ensure that wireless transmission occurs only when you turn on the device before wearing it, and when you remove the device when you wake up.
It's For Everyone!Yes, everyone!, We are ""open"" at heart and believe you should be free to pick your preferred app, switch apps, and switch phones while your data is always YOURS! Do you like apps with a simplistic pink UI? Or packed with physiological information and Fertility Awareness methods applied by the app? Either way we will be happy to integrate with as many apps as possible. In fact we have already collaborated with top fertility apps - the first of many.   
Works with Bluetooth 4.0 supported devices onlyDownload links at the bottom of the page Fertility app developers, join in!!! Accurate  
High-end electronic components - Minute fluctuations of a woman's Basal temperature during her cycle require accurate readings. Achieving such accuracy when measured on the skin requires more than just a temperature sensor. Therefore, we've carefully selected our electronic components and sensors to get an accurate, standardized, temperature reading. 
Genuine Basal Body Temperature - Basal Body Temperature (or BBT) is defined as the lowest temperature our body reaches over a 24 hour day which usually occurs in deep sleep. Nowadays, women who wish to measure their BBT are required to wake-up every day at the same time and take their temperature while still lying in bed, without moving or even sitting up due the fact that body temperature rises when we move.
 
BBT plays a major role in predicting ovulation using the Sympto-Thermal method and it is also the only quantified and objective parameter women should track. However, women find it very hard to follow this demanding routine, which forces the app to rely on less quantified data. 
Furthermore, wake-up temping is only an approximation of your true BBT and is affected by overall sleep quality and more specifically events of waking up at night and inconsistent sleeping hours. 
 
And here comes the great thing about Tempdrop™:  
It will monitor your sleep quality to distinguish events or interrupted sleep, and also learn your personal temperature pattern during sleep (circadian rhythm). By doing that (and more) we are focusing on seamlessly integrating a definitive and standardized parameter into fertility apps to enable the most accurate predictions. What are you supporting? At some point, any couple could find themselves facing fertility issues and the constant preoccupation of logging and charting puts a nerve-wracking pressure on the woman, which makes conception even harder. Fertility apps offer an affordable and advanced platform for an accurate and effective fertility prediction solution.

Critical Care Medicine in Nepal.Dr.Subhash Acharya is the President of the

<p><i>Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital (TUTH)</i>: one of the oldest and largest public hospitals in Nepal. TUTH provides high
quality, relatively affordable tertiary level health services to people of
lower socioeconomic status from across Nepal.</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>The Need:</b></p>
<p>The majority of the Nepali people are poor and cannot pay for
health care as there is no health insurance system.Every year patients
needlessly lose their lives in an ICU in Nepal just because they cannot afford
to buy essential drugs and medical equipment required for their treatment. To
compound matters, in an emergency situation, health care workers will order the required
equipment and medications,but then the patient’s family must leave the ICU to retrieve,
pay for, and return with the supplies to ICU which costs precious minutes in a
life and death situation.</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>The Solution:</b></p>
<p>To improve timely and equitable
access to lifesaving treatments, NCCDF is pioneering the NCCDF ICU Care Box.
This box is a collection of essential medical equipment and supplies located
within the ICU for rapid access in an emergency situation. Patients will be
asked to replenish the supplies after the emergency has passed. For those
unable to afford replenishment, the supplies will be a donation for their care.</p>
<p>The NCCDF Care Boxes are
initially being trialled at TUTH. The ultimate goal is to expand the scope to all
public hospital ICUs in Nepal.</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>The Numbers:</b></p>
<p>For an 11 bed ICU, we estimate a
single NCCDF Care Box will cost $2000 USD and last 3 months. Annual cost is
thus $8000 USD. The foundation will check the inventory at
regular intervals, monitoring depletion rate and replacing supplies as
required.</p>
<p>If NCCDF is unable to collect the
required funds for an ICU Care Box, the money that has been collected will be
donated to the NCCDF Poor Patients Fund. The Poor Patient Fund is used to help
patients afford their medications during their stay in the ICU.</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>Summary</b></p>
<p>NCCDF staff continually witness
needless suffering and death within Nepali ICUs due to delays or financial
barriers in accessing supplies. The NCCDF Care Box is a simple, inexpensive
solution to help improve patient care. Every donation counts no matter how
small because even the purchase of a single syringe can make all the
difference when saving someone’s life.</p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>THE
IMPACT</b></p>
<p>Any contribution made toward saving lives are always valuable
either be it monetary or non-monetary. This project is valuable in the sense
that this box will help save a number of lives. We have witnessed how people
have suffered needlessly and unnecessarily just because they cannot afford to
buy medications in an emergency situation. </p>
<p>This is the first of the care box being implemented at Tribhuvan
University Teaching Hospital (TUTH). We are confident of the success and hope
to expand the project to other public hospital ICUs in Nepal.</p><p></p><p>We look forward to your support.</p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The list of medical supplies and equipment in the Care Box:</span><br/></p><p></p><table>
