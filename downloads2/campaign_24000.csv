Beautiful Joe 

Beautiful Joe is based upon the classic 1894 novel by Canadian author and activist, Margaret Marshall Saunders (1861-1947), at the time, Canada's best selling book. Written by award-winning Canadian Playwright Michael O'Brien, Beautiful Joe is a play with a passionate message about a real-life farm-dog born near Meaford, Ontario, who suffered cruel abuse at the hands of his master. The story is told from the perspective of the rescued dog Joe, as he recounts his adventures in an inhumane world through mask, puppetry and song in this moving, funny, heart-warming tale for the whole family—set in a distinctly Canadian landscape. Beautiful Joe has been assisted by the Ontario Arts Council, Theatre Direct Canada and Young People's Theatre.
The Tank Range Project 
In 1942, The Government of Canada forced 100 families off of 17000 acres of farmland in the St. Vincent Township of Southwestern Ontario, to be used as an Armored Vehicle Fighting area to train for the war effort overseas. The Tank Range Project is a play that explores this history by dramatically contrasting the importance of those farmers’ original sacrifices, to the land’s use for the military conflict in Afghanistan today. This collaborative piece, written by GBAC company founders Jamie Robinson and Roger Shank, is a mix of fictional drama and biography, including interviews of former St. Vincent Township residents and current military personnel, in addition to reviews of dozens of news articles and books written about the expropriation. In 2010, The Tank Range Project received a Stratford Tyrone Guthrie Award for new play development.
Our History and Intent

With a cast of 7 professional and upcoming actors and a creative team of well established artisans behind the scenes, both plays are sure to make an impact upon the rural theatrical stage.

Inspired Dance Scholarships was created to provide dance classes to students who have the desire to dance but do not have the financial means to take classes. </p>
<p>Your contribution to the Inspired Dance Scholarship also provides an opportunity for youth to learn and express themselves creatively, build character and be exposed to a positive, encouraging and creative environment. Students receive a sense of empowerment when they go out into the community and demonstrate what they’ve learned to inspire others through their dance. Studies show that exposure to dance benefits the life of teenagers in many ways. To name a few: Dance is an all-around healthy activity; it is a great way to meet people with similar interests, it provides a way to get off the street, creates a positive outlook, and a great way to help teens develop better self-confidence. Activities like dance also help teens perform better at school.</p>
<p>Contributing to the life of another is a wonderful feeling. Join our mission; contribute to a young life today by supporting the Inspire Dance Scholarship. Help us lift spirits by planting a seed of hope and bringing out greatness hidden within.

<p>My name is Maya, founder of Dunamis Creative Arts School, LLC. I trained in ballet and modern dance as a teenager and young adult. As a young adult I earned a BA in Marketing and Advertising. My hopes were to have a career working for one of the largest Advertising agencies in the world and maybe one day start my own agency. It turns out that God had another plan for my life.  The Lord called me back into dance several years later and planted a seed in my heart to show people His love from a creative platform bringing hope and healing to hearts with a positive message. The vision God has given me is a large one, and I cannot do it alone. I’m trusting in God that He will make a way. He knows the beginning and the end, all I can do is walk in faith in His will putting one foot in front of the other. I love what I’m doing, and your interest and support mean the world to me. Your donation is greatly appreciated!</p>
<p>God is a creative God. The gifts and talent He gives range far &amp; wide and I encourage you to use what God has given you to bring His name glory.

<p>“city lights” falls into a unique type of experimental theatre.  billed as a play with dance, the main goal of “city lights” is to marry the worlds of dance, theatre and independent music by featuring a cast of fresh faces, dance pieces from up and coming choreographers and music from independent musicians.  ""city lights"" will introduce a new, modern form of musical theatre, a recipe for something completely new and inspiring – we just need a little help to make it happen.</p>
<p>written as a response to films such as ""black swan"" and ""center stage"",  “city lights” captures the world of an unfunded, independent dance company and the people who populate it.  whether you have a connection to the dance world or not, these are people we've known, situations we've experienced, and broken hearts we have all felt.  these characters have big dreams and struggle as they fight to make their dreams come true.</p>
<p>some of the musicians featured in the piece include jeremy kushnier, apollo run, the yes team, cristofani, and erick shakne.</p>
<p>the writer izze gibson grew up loving musical theatre, having a great passion for music and the intensity of allowing movement to be an expression of emotion.  the idea of breaking into song during a musical is what inspired her to create that allusion of emoting through dance during a play.  the stage suddenly becomes an alternate reality when the actors use their bodies instead of their voices.  it has become most important to ms gibson to expose the intensity of the dance world in this piece.</p>
<p>red door theatre company is an independent theatre company founded in 2005 by kate erin gibson.  red door's mission statement is to produce socially relevant theatrical pieces and to offer a safe haven for controversial or delicate subject matter to be explored on stage;  to provide opportunities for performers, designers, directors, playwrights, composers, choreographers, stage managers and other artists, in all stages of their careers, to express themselves in a risk-free environment;  to provide educational opportunities for all ages, including internships in all fields related to theatrical production;  to create a network of artists who will blend into a supportive, creative community. <a href=""http://www.thereddoortheatre.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.thereddoortheatre.com</a> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>what's in it for me?</h3>
<p>theatre is expensive and it can be very hard to make a life as an artist.  any and all funds raised will:</p>
<ul>
<li>help the production team secure space and the tools needed to put the show up (including but not limited to costumes, props, and printing costs)</li>
<li>allow the producers to pay the creative team (lighting designer, costume designer, stage manager, choreographer), actors, and musicians for their time and talents</li>
</ul>
<p>the goal of this indiegogo campaign is to act as a supplement to the budget of the show,  and every dollar will be resourcefully spent in creating an incredible theatrical experience.</p>
<p>donors have the opportunity to give whatever they feel comfortable with.  the perks including everything from complimentary tickets to receiving a co-producer credit on the production.</p>
<p>there is no plan of profiting from this production.  the funds raised through indiegogo with off-set the anticipated ticket sales, allowing the theatre company to break even financially. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>our plan</h3>
<p>what sets ""city lights"" apart from other projects is the desire to create a new genre of theatre.  </p>
<p>our plan is to put up an off-off broadway production and use as minimal a budget as possible to gain attention from potential investors from production companies, theatre companies, and independent financial backers interested in the show.  to find a time and place to have an extended run in manhattan is the ultimate goal – and provide a spring board for young dancers who are also brilliant actors to find their place in new york theatre.</p>

<p>Portland based dance company<strong> <a href=""http://bobbevy.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">bobbevy</a> </strong>and independent choreographer <strong>Kelly Anderson</strong> are seeking support to facilitate a tour this September of our most recent works,<strong> The Little Things</strong> and <strong>This is how we Disappear</strong>.

<p><strong>About the Dances</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>The Little Things </strong>is a work by independent choreographer <strong>Kelly Anderson, </strong>featuring guest NYC performers <strong>Cassandra Motta </strong>and<strong> Mary Madsen. </strong>This original piece is an exploration of the simple gestures of a lost relationship and the details we choose to forget. A dance of two women and two bed sheets. Each sheet representing her personal journey of what had created the absence of love. Simple, a woman and a sheet. Not so simple, the little things.</p>
<p><strong>This is how we Disappear</strong> is an original new work created by Portland based dance company<a href=""http://bobbevy.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong> bobbevy. </strong></a>This new work juxtaposes the natural simplicity of time passing with our own experience of human relationships, fraught with frailty, tension and tenderness. Dancers <strong>Philippe Bronchtein and Jessica Hightower </strong>embody choreographer,<strong> Suniti Dernovsek’s</strong> unique movement vocabulary, marked by intricacy and expressiveness. <strong>This is how we Disappear</strong> features visual design by <strong>David Stein</strong>, sound, composed/generated by <strong>Jesse Mejia</strong> and real time video by <strong>Brian Richardson.</strong> Together, the collaborators create a live, interactive performance that blends movement, visual art, sound and video.</p>

</div></div>","Portland based dance company bobbevy and independent choreographer Kelly Anderson are seeking support to facilitate a tour this September of our most recent works, The Little Things and This is how we Disappear. We are the recipients of a DanceLab space grant awarded by the Danceworks Performance Company, which provides a discount on total theater rental costs.  This tour provides the unique opportunity to present our work to new audiences in Milwaukee, WI and build relationships with other Midwest artists. Your support will assist in eight artist fees and travel expenses.
About the Dances
 The Little Things is a work by independent choreographer Kelly Anderson, featuring guest NYC performers Cassandra Motta and Mary Madsen. This original piece is an exploration of the simple gestures of a lost relationship and the details we choose to forget. A dance of two women and two bed sheets. Each sheet representing her personal journey of what had created the absence of love. Simple, a woman and a sheet. Not so simple, the little things.
This is how we Disappear is an original new work created by Portland based dance company bobbevy. This new work juxtaposes the natural simplicity of time passing with our own experience of human relationships, fraught with frailty, tension and tenderness. Dancers Philippe Bronchtein and Jessica Hightower embody choreographer, Suniti Dernovsek’s unique movement vocabulary, marked by intricacy and expressiveness. This is how we Disappear features visual design by David Stein, sound, composed/generated by Jesse Mejia and real time video by Brian Richardson. Together, the collaborators create a live, interactive performance that blends movement, visual art, sound and video.
About the Artists
Kelly Anderson is an independent choreographer currently based in NYC. She has created evening-length works with Danceworks Performance Company, Vaudeville (2011) and The Bra Project (2009), collaborated with Milwaukee Opera Theatre to create an original opera, 26 (2010), choreographed Gal Friday Film’s Missed Connections (2011), Red Knife Lottery’s music video Junkie Jazz, created The Mondo Lucha Dancers for The Mondo Lucha Variety Show (2011), and has performed/co-produced seven Variety Show’s (2002-present). Her work has also been performed in The Minnesota Fringe Festival, on Your Mother Dances, and at The Puffin Room (NYC).

<h3><strong>Congratulations--we've successfully raised the funds for me to get to Kolkata for Muktadhara, the International Festival of Theatre of the Oppressed! Thank you for the tremendous support of this work!</strong></h3>
We are continuing the campaign to raise funds for the Eastside Forum Project, our very local manifestation of this global Theatre of the Oppressed Movement! It is my dream to help build Living Stages into an organization that has deep roots in our local communities AND strong connections to a vibrant international movement of Theatre of the Oppressed artists. Attending Muktadhara in 2012 is a powerful step towards building the connections to make that dream possible.</div>

<div> </div>
<div>When I return to Portland in January, I'll be using the skills and experience gained from my time in India to develp, train, and support a performance troupe made up of residents living, working, and accessing services along East 82nd. Eastside Forum will perform next summer in Farmers Markets and locations along the East Side, with a goal of generating dialogue and action about the challenges and possibilities of this commuity. The long-term goal is to create an ongoing theatre presence along Eastside neighborhoods as a process for community engagement and dialogue about the many issues our communities face! </div>
<div> </div>
<div>All additional funds raised will go towards outreach for the initial training, facilitation, and support of community performers during the play development and rehearsal process!</div>

<p><strong>More about the Muktadhara campaign:</strong></p>
<p>My name is Tamara Lynne, and I'm a theatre artist and activist based in Portland, Oregon. For me, theatre has always been a powerful tool for empowerment. I founded a theatre organization called Living Stages that is committed to the use of Theatre of the Oppressed for community dialogue, reflection, and action. Theatre of the Oppressed is a form of interactive theatre from Brazil that was developed by Augusto Boal, and is now practiced in over 200 countries around the world as a process of social and political transformation.</p>
<p>I have been invited to participate in Muktdhara, the International Festival of Theatre of the Oppressed in Kolkata India in December 2012. This festival is hosted by <a href=""http://www.janasanskriti.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Jana Sanskriti,</a> the largest Theatre of the Oppressed organization in the world. With 27 years of experience and over 30 theatre troupes across India, they perform interactive theatre for audiences of up to 7,000 people! I received a grant from the Regional Arts and Culture Council to help pay for airfare, an individual donation to cover the bulk of travel expenses, and now have raised the $650 needed to cover the registration fees for the festival. Now, I'm working to raise funds to continue my work with the Eastside Forum Project!</p>
<p>The work I've been able to do with Living Stages has been possible because of a supportive and enthusiastic community who see the value of Theatre of the Oppressed in building movements for social change. I ask your support once again to support this exciting opportunity, and help us make international connections to grow and sustain our work. </p>

<h3><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>ME AND MY BIG MOUTH – ONE WOMAN COMEDY SHOW</strong></span></h3>
<h3><strong>Written and Performed by Philippa Fordham</strong></h3>
<p>Me And My Big Mouth is a dynamic one-woman multi character comedy show packed with a variety of hopelessly deluded and outlandish characters.</p>
<p>This hour long show is energetic, sometimes dark and fast paced. Various characters mix with the audience, opening the door to some blatant fun and interaction.</p>
<p>With plenty of physical humour and a wealth of songs, the show goes straight for the comedy jugular and aims for big laughs. </p>
<p>In October 2012 the show premiered at The Hen And Chickens Theatre, London for two nights and was a sell out. The next performance will be at The Leicester Square Theatre, London on 31<sup>st</sup> Janauary and 20<sup>th</sup> March 2013.</p>

<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">ABOUT ME</span></strong> </p>
<p>I am an actress, writer and comedian and can often be found showing off on a stage somewhere on the London comedy circuit. </p>
<p>I co-wrote and performed in my own BBC Radio 4 comedy sketch show Fordham &amp; Lipson and subsequently sketches from the show were selected for BBC’s Radio 4’s ‘Pick of the Week’ for two consecutive weeks.</p>
<p>Fordham &amp; Lipson were also nominated for the Dubble Act Award at the Edinburgh Festival 2005. </p>
<p>Currently I am co-writing a comedy series for television, which is in development with BBC Television. Prior to this I've had two other writing commissions with BBC TV.</p>
<p>Some of my acting work can be seen in the film Jonny English (Rowan Atkinson touched my bottom), BBC TV's Wild West (Dawn French tried on my ring), People Like Us (David Tenant liked my hair) and This is Dom Joly (Dom made me tea).</p>

<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">WHAT I NEED</span></strong></p>
<p>I would like to perform my show at the Edinburgh Festival 2013 - Scotland, UK. The Festival runs for one month and is expensive. I need to raise £10,000 so that I can pay for venue hire, entry into the Fringe Brochure, PR, printing costs for leaflets and posters, insurance, accommodation and travel. All of these costs can easily amount to £10,000.</p>
<p><strong>I have already secured a top venue to perform my show - The</strong>Appearing at the Edinburgh Festival enables me to showcase my work and be seen by radio and television producers and casting directors. This exposure will potentially help me attain further employment in the comedy industry as a writer and actress as well as secure a producer to develop my show further for Radio and/or Television.</p>
<p>It is unlikely that I will make a profit at the Edinburgh Festival, mainly due to the high costs appearing there. With ticket prices at around £7 - £10 each and a venue capacity of approximately 50 seats, it is therefore nonviable to make a profit from ticket sales after all the costs. However breaking even at the Edinburgh Festival is a great achievement and if ticket sales go well, this is possible.</p>

<p>“Edinburgh Festival is to festivals what Wimbledon is to tennis.” - THE STAGE</p>
<p>Edinburgh is recognised as the home of the largest and most comprehensive Arts Festival in the world. The Fringe, which is in its own right the largest festival in the world, is what many, especially young people, think of as the Edinburgh Festival, being cheaper, more informal and a lot more fun! The Fringe began as a spontaneous addition to the first Edinburgh International Festival in 1947, a kind of polite protest by the more adventurous elements of the arts against what they saw as “The Establishment”.</p>
<p>Over sixty years on, the Fringe is now much more professionally organised and tends to revolve around venues who promote mini-festivals of comedy, cabaret, theatre, music, dance and visual arts. </p>
<p>• The Edinburgh International Festival</p>
<p>• The Edinburgh Festival Fringe</p>
<p>• The Edinburgh Military Tattoo</p>
<p>• The Edinburgh International Book Festival</p>

<p>Within this multitude of activities the two main platforms for the performing arts are the Edinburgh International Festival (EIF) and the Festival Fringe.</p>
<p>The official Festival presents a programme of events chosen by its Director. The Fringe, in contrast, is an open house. It thrives on the initiative and enthusiasm of those who continue to bring their shows from all over the world.</p>

<h3><strong>Celebrating Two Radical Legacies...</strong></h3>
<p>Thomas Paine and Harry Bridges, two of the most misunderstood men in American history, are coming to Los Angeles.  These two men changed the course of nations with their vision, biting wit, stubbornness, wives, whiskey, and unswerving determination to make the world a better place. </p>
<p><a href=""http://www.ianruskin.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Ian Ruskin</a> has performed his two one-man plays, <strong><em>""To Begin the World Over Again: the Life of Thomas Paine""</em></strong> &amp; <strong><em>""From Wharf Rats to Lords of the Docks""</em></strong>, over 250 times all over the world to much acclaim, but never in a theatrical run in his hometown of Los Angeles. It’s finally time to do that, and we ask you to help us put a roof over our heads. </p>
<p><a href=""http://thelifeofthomaspaine.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Paine</strong></a> sparked the American Revolution when a world was beginning to shed its old skin. No other Founding Father came close to Thomas Paine's vision of democracy.

Celebrating Two Radical Legacies...
Thomas Paine and Harry Bridges, two of the most misunderstood men in American history, are coming to Los Angeles.  These two men changed the course of nations with their vision, biting wit, stubbornness, wives, whiskey, and unswerving determination to make the world a better place. 
Ian Ruskin has performed his two one-man plays, ""To Begin the World Over Again: the Life of Thomas Paine"" & ""From Wharf Rats to Lords of the Docks"", over 250 times all over the world to much acclaim, but never in a theatrical run in his hometown of Los Angeles. It’s finally time to do that, and we ask you to help us put a roof over our heads. 
Paine sparked the American Revolution when a world was beginning to shed its old skin. No other Founding Father came close to Thomas Paine's vision of democracy. He helped shape our national character, inspires us to be guardians of that legacy, and based his beliefs on one simple idea, “justice for all.” This call for justice resounds in America today in the Occupy movement and in the words of Martin Luther King: “the moral arc of history is long, but it bends toward justice.” Ruskin was awarded a COLA Fellowship to create this play in 2011. 
Bridges was at the heart of the great struggle for worker’s rights and became the San Francisco labor leader who organized the self-proclaimed “wharf rats” of the West Coast piers.

<p>My name is Anna Brooke and I am the first ever certified Wu Tao teacher in the US. My background is in both dance and healing and Wu Tao has been an incredible and truly special extension of both of my passions.</p>
<p>I am asking for your help to get Wu Tao founder Michelle Locke and her partner, Steve Richter (Wu Tao music composer) to New York City this coming July! Michelle is spearheading Wu Tao International after creating a strong presence in her native Australia and we need your help to pay their way to NYC to continue spreading the love and practice of Wu Tao! Airfare from Perth to New York City is around $3000 per person which is a massive expense. Although they are rich in spirit, that's a serious amount of money to spend without any guaranteed return. By donating to this campaign, you will be helping them reduce their overhead and assisting them in having an affordable and profitable trip to the Big Apple!</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>Believe it or not, every dollar of this campaign will support Michelle and Steve's transportation to NYC and any remainder will help them pay living expenses and food - that's really it! </p>
<p>Our goal is $6000 which will cover the expense of their plane tickets (as long as the tickets stay under $3000 apiece!) Any additional funds will be applied to their expenses incurred while in NYC. Every dollar helps and all funds, no matter the final amount received, will go towards paying off their flights. </p>
<p>What do you get for helping? A LOT! Scroll through our perks below to see how you can help them and support your own wellbeing in the meantime! From ebooks to cds and DVDs, all the way up to admission to the first level of Wu Tao teacher training, your contributions will be rewarded with tools to promote your own sense of wellbeing and practice of Wu Tao. </p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>There has never been a more important time to restore our connection to life and embody our highest Selves. Dance is a potent healing force and a powerful way to bring ourselves back to truth, authenticity and love. It’s easy and very enjoyable to integrate Wu Tao’s simple yet powerful dance process into every part of your life! You can easily bring more flow, joy, energy and aliveness into your personal relationships, business, and community. By donating to this campaign, you will be helping us to help countless people, showing them how to cultivate peace and wellbeing within their lives, something that is sorely needed in NYC's hectic atmosphere.</p>

<h3>Bring Exene to NYC <span><br/></span>as The Conspiracy Therapist</h3>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Hey All of You X Fans!  Conspiracy Theorists!  Men in Black and the Women Who Abduct Them!  Help us bring Exene to New York! </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>November 22, 2013</b> marks the 50th anniversary of the assassination of President Kennedy.  Yes, we could mourn the man's passing, but instead, we choose to celebrate what was born that fateful day...the mother of all conspiracy theories!  Three Rooms Press proudly presents ""<b>JFK/NYC/<b>OMG""</b></b>, Friday, November 22, at Cornelia Street Cafe. This event celebrates conspiracy theories of all shapes, sizes, and paranoia levels!  So far our lineup for this show is a knockout, but we would love to add one more reader to our event - The Conspiracy Therapist herself, Exene Cervenka. </p>
<p></p>
<h3>About Exene</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Exene Cervenka, legendary poet, singer (X, Knitters, Original Sinners), songwriter, and artist, currently hosts a new web series on YouTube called The Conspiracy Therapist. For an artist who isn't afraid to lift the veil of the American Dream and poke around in its dark corners, whose work frequently delves into the mystical and the unseen, conspiracy theories are yet another fascinating facet of Americana, waiting to be explored, proven, or debunked.  </p>
<p>We're thrilled that she's 100% into joining our lineup and supporting this campaign, but the thousands of miles between her California abode and our NYC poetry grotto are really raining on our parade.  (Or it may not be rain.  It may be a chemical compound engineered by the government to act as growth hormones and turn us into a race of disease-resistant supersoldiers.)</p>
<p></p>
<h3>What we need and what you get</h3>
<p></p>
<p>To add Exene to our already-stunning roster, we need to cover her travel costs - because, hey, we at Three Rooms Press are firm believers in supporting our artists, be they East Coast or West!  The combined cost for Exene's stay comes to $1000. </p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>$5</b> -  A warm feeling of personal satisfaction and acknowledgement as a patron of the arts. <br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>$10 </b>- A doubly warm feeling of personal satisfaction and acknowledgement as a patron of the arts. <br/>

Hey All of You X Fans!  Conspiracy Theorists!  Men in Black and the Women Who Abduct Them!  Help us bring Exene to New York! 

November 22, 2013 marks the 50th anniversary of the assassination of President Kennedy.  Yes, we could mourn the man's passing, but instead, we choose to celebrate what was born that fateful day...the mother of all conspiracy theories!  Three Rooms Press proudly presents ""JFK/NYC/OMG"", Friday, November 22, at Cornelia Street Cafe. This event celebrates conspiracy theories of all shapes, sizes, and paranoia levels!  So far our lineup for this show is a knockout, but we would love to add one more reader to our event - The Conspiracy Therapist herself, Exene Cervenka. 

About Exene

Exene Cervenka, legendary poet, singer (X, Knitters, Original Sinners), songwriter, and artist, currently hosts a new web series on YouTube called The Conspiracy Therapist. For an artist who isn't afraid to lift the veil of the American Dream and poke around in its dark corners, whose work frequently delves into the mystical and the unseen, conspiracy theories are yet another fascinating facet of Americana, waiting to be explored, proven, or debunked.  
We're thrilled that she's 100% into joining our lineup and supporting this campaign, but the thousands of miles between her California abode and our NYC poetry grotto are really raining on our parade.  (Or it may not be rain.  It may be a chemical compound engineered by the government to act as growth hormones and turn us into a race of disease-resistant supersoldiers.)

What we need and what you get

To add Exene to our already-stunning roster, we need to cover her travel costs - because, hey, we at Three Rooms Press are firm believers in supporting our artists, be they East Coast or West!  The combined cost for Exene's stay comes to $1000. 



$5 -  A warm feeling of personal satisfaction and acknowledgement as a patron of the arts. 


$10 - A doubly warm feeling of personal satisfaction and acknowledgement as a patron of the arts. 


$25 - Your name will be printed in the program and you'll get a copy of the program sent to you signed by Exene!!! Plus that special feeling of giving to a project you totally believe in.


$50 - Your name will appear in the program, and you'll get a program signed by Exene.  PLUS a special reserved seat for the night of Friday, November 22 show JFK/NYC/OMG at Cornelia Street Cafe (does not include cost of ticket). PLUS that truly special feeling from giving to a project you totally believe in.

<p>In an effort to educate hand dancers on the evolution of Swing Dance from Lindy to Hand Dance, The National Hand Dance Association is embarking on a program to bring original Lindy Hop legends of Harlem, New York's historic Savoy Ballroom - Norma Miller (94 year old Queen of Swing), George Sullivan, Sugar Sullivan, and Sonny Allen to the Nation's Capitol  All were staples original architechts of Lindy Hop and Swing during Lindy Hop's golden years from 1930-1970. They will be brought to Washington, DC and paired with legends of Hand Dance in discussions on the history of Lindy Hop and Hand Dance, the connections between the two traditional dances, and new directions of both dance forms.</p>
<p>The program entitled Hand Dance and Lindy Hop: The Evolution of a DC Tradition will take place September 27-28, 2013. Accompanying these oral history discussions are master class workshops in Lindy (taught by and Hand Dance, an afternoon of film screenings, a dance jam session with the Lindy Hop legends and hand dancers. </p>
<p>The National Hand Dance Association is a 501(c)3 non profit organization whose mission is to Preserve, Educate and Promote the art form of Hand Dance.  This program will be free and open to the public for the two days of his important presentation.  It is important to bring together the elders of these two dance forms in order for the legacy of these cultures to be passed down to the next generation of Lindy Hop dancers and Hand Dancers. Interest in Lindy Hop is growing amongst a new generation of social dancers, and youth in the DC area are begining to make Hand Dance their dance of choice.</p>
<p>The funds raised in this fundraising effort will be used for travel, hotel accommodations, and honorarium for the legends of Lindy Hop.  Three will travel from Florida and the remaining will come from Harlem in New York City. Honorarium is critical for their time and effort in traveling to Washington, DC. The honorarium is a small token of appreciation for their impact on American popular culture and American vernacular dance.  Washington, DC's Arena Stage will provide the venue for the September 28th historic panel discussion, dance workshops, and dance presentations.  Other partners include in-kind services and promotion by ""Gotta Swing"" (a Lindy Hop organization located in the Washington, DC area) and the African American Music Association.</p>

By working out of three cities, we have access to a plethora of new ideas and different inspirations depending on what location we are in, which keeps our artistic practice new, fresh and ever evolving. Through our work and activities, we strive to entertain and educate the public about dance and performance, making it accessible and enjoyable to all walks of life. As a company of emerging artists we feel responsible for the future of contemporary dance and we are committed to working tirelessly to ensure that this incredible art form lives on and reaches new heights.</p>

<p><span>The goal of The Watering Hole Project is to raise the profile of contemporary dance amongst people who may be new to, or have never experienced the art form before. </span></p>
<p>This is a multi-faceted dance project consisting of many events including:</p>

<p>-  Flash Mob performances with live music at some of Calgarys hottest music venues and during The Calgary Stampede </p>
<p>- Busking and dancing on the streets of Downtown Calgary during lunch hour</p>
<p>- An ""Open House"" at the historical John Snow House featuring dancing, live music, film, a silent auction and moderated discussions about contemporary dance and art. Friday July 20, 2012  3 - 10pm</p>
<p>- Full length performance of ""Watering Hole"" at Dancers Studio West in Calgary on July 25th at 8pm.  </p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>ABOUT THE PIECE:</strong></p>
<p><span>This day in age in North America, many young people and artists spend countless hours working in restaurants and bars in order to make ends meet. Using personal experiences, the choreographers are working together to create a full length dance piece that looks into the world of the local watering hole with a magnifying glass. The full dance work will be approximately 50 minutes in length and tells the story of a typical night at a popular local bar. Characters include the Bartender, Waitress, and various patrons. As the piece develops, the viewer receives close up views of all nine characters and discovers why they are at the bar on this given night. Using a language of pure contemporary dance, and set to live music by local bands <em>The Bownesians </em> and <em>Magik Spells</em>, Watering Hole rises and falls and has moments of humor, frustration and passion.</span></p>
<p><span><br/></span></p>
<p><strong>WHY ARE WE DOING THIS?</strong></p>
<div>
<p>Watering Hole is not your typical contemporary dance piece. The purpose of creating this show is not only to showcase the extraordinary talents of the dancers and musicians involved, but to build a deeper connection between dance and the community. Concert dance is often considered as ""high art"" and can be hard to relate to for many people. Our main goal through this project is to break the traditional boundaries of concert dance and to show our community that contemporary dance is a fun, entertaining and inspiring vehicle for expression and storytelling. By performing in public areas we aim to connect wtih as many people as we can, showing them that dance is an accessible art form that can be part of their lives. </p>
<h2><strong>What We Need and How You Can Help...</strong></h2>
</div>
<div>
<p>Putting together a full length dance show takes an incredible amount of time, work, committment, and of course, money. We need to raise a few extra bucks to make sure this amazing project can blossom to its fullest potential. </p>
<p>Here is a breakdown of the costs involved in this project: </p>
<p> </p>
<p>120 hours of rehearsal space = $2400</p>
<p>Compensation for 9 professional dancers = $4500</p>
<p>Pay for 3 choreographers/directors = $1500</p>
<p>Pay for bands to create new music = $1000</p>
<p>Costumes and props for the show = $1000</p>
<p>Theatre Rental = $500</p>
<p>Lighting and sound technician = $500</p>
<p> </p>
<p>**We have been fortunate enough to recieve funding from <strong>Cultural Capital of Canada - Calgary 2012</strong> for this project, however it only covers a PORTION of the costs. We are needing to raise an extra $3600 in order to cover all the expenses in this project. We are reaching out to our family, friends, audience, and art/music/dance lovers out there for some help in realizing our dreams. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Making a donation is easy, and you can donate as little or as much as you wish. As a token of our apreciation every funder will recieve a little gift from us. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
As I mentioned before, I believe that a for profit concern can also be altruistic and community minded at the same time. We want to organize a for profit theatre. We want to prove that you can make a living, and not HAVE to make a killing. I think that a certain amount of profit can and SHOULD be earmarked for For outreach, and charity, as well as the opportunity to offer OTHER non profits funds to further their causes.</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The money in the beginning goes to the purchase of equipment and Mobile light, Sound, Video, and photographic equipment. It also goes for the reasonable expenses incurred with the running of a theatre group. Marketing, advertising, Licensing of scripts, Rental of stage space, Set building and dressing costuming, hair and make up, and the payment of Area professionals to offer the community workshops and lectures to advance the Multimedia and theatre education for anyone interested.</p>
<p>50,000.00 is the figure that we have arrived at to pursue this, and fund it properly for 2 seasons.</p>
<p>All donations between five and fifty dollars will receive a chance in a drawing for two free tickets one show for the first two seasons.</p>
<p>All donations between fifty-one and one hundred dollars receive the above plus Name in the First Program of the first season.</p>
<p>All donations between 100.00 and 250.00 Receive level one and Name in all programs for one Season.</p>
<p>All donations between 250.01 and 500.00 Receive level one and Banner sized advertisement in all programs for one season, and ONE Commemorative T shirt.</p>
<p>All donations between 501.00 and 1000.00 Receive Level one and 1 season ticket for one season, and ONE commemorative T shirt.</p>

<p>If goal is not met, funds will be held until other funding efforts have helped us realize the goal, and all perks will be honored.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
We truly believe, that we can combine a for profit business, with the altruistic origin of a non profit. We will NOT be able to fundraise publicly, and we will NOT receive any tax exemptions. We WILL be able to plot the course of our own theatrical destiny and rely on ourselves and our community to help as realize our goals, and to turn our dreams into our reality.</div>

All donations between fifty-one and one hundred dollars receive the above plus Name in the First Program of the first season.
All donations between 100.00 and 250.00 Receive level one and Name in all programs for one Season.
All donations between 250.01 and 500.00 Receive level one and Banner sized advertisement in all programs for one season, and ONE Commemorative T shirt.
All donations between 501.00 and 1000.00 Receive Level one and 1 season ticket for one season, and ONE commemorative T shirt.
All donations over 1250.00 Receive quarter page of adspace, and two season tickets for one season, and TWO Commemorative T shirts
If goal is not met, funds will be held until other funding efforts have helped us realize the goal, and all perks will be honored.


The Impact
We truly believe, that we can combine a for profit business, with the altruistic origin of a non profit. We will NOT be able to fundraise publicly, and we will NOT receive any tax exemptions. We WILL be able to plot the course of our own theatrical destiny and rely on ourselves and our community to help as realize our goals, and to turn our dreams into our reality.

<h3><strong>Creation of an Indian National Classical Ballet Company</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>Phase One: Production of a multicultural dance creation by the Gloria Mandelik Dance Company</strong></h3>
<p>After a first successful tour in 2011 (see videos and photos of this tour in the Gallery section), The Gloria Mandelik  Dance Company,  combining Classical Ballet with the dance idioms of Spanish and Indian dance, has been invited by the Indian Council for Cultural Relations to make a second tour of India. The I.C.C.R. is interested in Mandelik´s new choreography, based on a classic of Hindu mythology.</p>
<p>The new ballet is the love story of the celestial dancer Urvashi and the mortal king Pururavas. Their trials and tribulations are a sort of Indian combination of Swan Lake and Giselle, but with a happy ending. This story is based on the ancient texts of the Satapatha Brahmanas and Kalidasa’s 4<sup>th</sup> century play and will be choreographed in Classical Western Ballet style, also bringing in elements of Bharata Natyam and Spanish dance. Gloria´s work has always exemplified the importance and rewards of close collaboration and mutual influences between East and West.</p>
<h3><strong>Gloria´s Career</strong></h3>
<p>Embracing Classical Ballet, Spanish Dance and Indian Classical Dance, the unusual and eclectic nature of Gloria Mandelik’s career has been the subject of interesting controversies since its beginning. Born in the United States, raised in France, she is has lived in Spain since 1960 and has also had 45 years of intimate and profound relations with India. The depth of her knowledge of the dance language of these three cultures can be appreciated by observing the heights to which she has risen in her career. Highlights of that career include, in Classical Ballet soloist and assistant choreographer in the Teatro alla Scala de Milan; in Spanish Dance she was star of the company of the legendary Pilar Lopez; in Indian Dance, when she danced in the UNESCO in Paris, a critic said; “Mandelik has taken the initiative to study classical dance in India and mastered it to perfection, which proves that culture is universal and has no national boundaries.""</p>

<h3><strong>What we need:</strong></h3>
<p>For Phase one of the project, we need to raise funds for the production costs of the new ballet, for dancers´ salaries and for travel from Spain to India.</p>
<p>The following is a budget breakdown of the Gloria Mandelik Dance Company's 2011 tour of India. The next tour's budget will be similar, subject to slight modifications depending on planning.</p>
<p>Artistic Direction/Choreography_______________ $6000</p>

<h3>All contributors to the campaign are welcome to attend any and all rehearsals of the new production.</h3>
<p>Supporting this project is a chance to be involved in the creation of a new work of art which could very well be the cornerstone of a future project of even greater transcendence…</p>
<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
<p>Gloria´s long-term goal is the creation of an Indian National Classical Ballet Company, an idea in which certain Indian authorities have expressed interest. The first phase of the project will provide an opportunity to tour India with a multicultural dance creation which exemplifies the type of ballet that could form the repertoire of such a company,</p>
<p>India is the only major Asian power that does not have such an institution. As much as Gloria reveres the Classical Dances of India, which she has studied, performed and taught, she knows that they reach only a very limited public outside of India, due to the intricacies which only a connoisseur can appreciate. On the other hand, Classical Western Ballet, due to its more abstract form of expression, can narrate any theme to an international public. Classical Ballet choreographies based on the great Hindu epics would disseminate Indian culture on a global level and bring people closer to India’s great cultural heritage. An Indian National Classical Ballet Company would also provide an opportunity for ballet dancers of the Indian diaspora to return to their motherland and be a part of this exciting institution.</p>
<p>Other benefits resulting from the formation of a National Classical Ballet of India are the possibilities for the company to tour abroad, and for Indian musicians trained as Classical musicians abroad and in Zubin Mehta’s Mumbai School to compose original music for new ballets, thereby enhancing the collaborative nature of these two disciplines and creating further bonds between East and West.</p>
<p>Taking the implications of this project even further, the future would include the creation of a school associated with the Ballet Company to train dancers of future generations.</p>

<p><em>Hanging Georgia</em> is an ensemble based collaborative production by two groundbreaking San Francisco Bay Area theatre companies, TheatreFIRST and BootStrap Theater Foundation. TheatreFIRST was started in 1993 as an actor collective and has grown to become one of the finest theatrical organizations in the Bay Area.

</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We hope you will join us in bringing this exciting new work to bay area audiences. We are reaching out to all art colleges and art galleries so that people who have been affected by Georgia O'Keeffe's work can come and learn more about this important American painter. This production is an ensemble movement-based piece that requires a lot of resources because of the extended period of time necessary to develop the piece. Several workshops over the past year and several new drafts of the script have led up to the start of rehearsals which began on August 29th. We need additional support to help pay the actors, designers, and crew members during the run of the show. Both TheatreFIRST and BootStrap are smaller companies so any and all monies donated go directly to the artists producing the work.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are still in need of approximately $12,000.00 to help cover designer, crew and actor fees. And whether or not we reach our goal of $5,000.00 your IndieGoGo donations will go directly to these wonderful people! Because of the current climate in American theatre and the limited resources, this type of collaborative work is extremely rare. You will be providing the means to keep this type of amazing work alive and thriving.</p>

<div>Please keep spreading the word about Tantalus as our production is only a few weeks away.</div>
<div> </div>

<div>PROJECT<br/><br/><em>Tantalus</em> is a site-specific installation inspired by the classical myth of <a class=""nav"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tantalus"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""new"">King Tántalos</a>. There are various versions of his punishment by the gods. The multivalence of his suffering invites personalized readings. Yet its universality touches upon burdens that we all share as human beings.<br/><br/><em>Tantalus</em> is conceived for a solo performer. The project continues our company's investigation into theatre as an art form capable of incorporating many different kinds of art. The installation exists outside any specific time. We aim to confront this classical icon, as well as the western tradition of the <em>corpus</em>, or body, as a problem. Spectators enter a large, modern building and descend into its depths. They approach a source of light streaming through an opening in a wall. They peer inside ...<br/><br/> The installation is open for 2 hours at a time. Spectators are ushered into the space, free to remain as long as they wish.<br/><br/> CAMPAIGN<br/><br/> Our goal is to raise $1,000 in 11 days.<br/><br/> All donations go directly towards building materials for the installation's scenic design.<br/><br/> You have the option to donate any amount. The amounts listed at right are the minimum for the listed perks.<br/><br/><em>Tantalus</em> will have free admission, so this campaign is the project's primary economic resource.<br/><br/> Your generous contribution will bring this unique project to life and support a new company taking its first steps.

On behalf of Ashes Company, we want to thank all of you who so generously supported this fundraising effort and helped us reach our goal within just a few days! 
 
Please keep spreading the word about Tantalus as our production is only a few weeks away.
 
And thank you again for helping us bring ideas to life.
  
PROJECTTantalus is a site-specific installation inspired by the classical myth of King Tántalos. There are various versions of his punishment by the gods. The multivalence of his suffering invites personalized readings. Yet its universality touches upon burdens that we all share as human beings.Tantalus is conceived for a solo performer. The project continues our company's investigation into theatre as an art form capable of incorporating many different kinds of art. The installation exists outside any specific time. We aim to confront this classical icon, as well as the western tradition of the corpus, or body, as a problem. Spectators enter a large, modern building and descend into its depths. They approach a source of light streaming through an opening in a wall. They peer inside ... The installation is open for 2 hours at a time. Spectators are ushered into the space, free to remain as long as they wish. CAMPAIGN Our goal is to raise $1,000 in 11 days. All donations go directly towards building materials for the installation's scenic design. You have the option to donate any amount. The amounts listed at right are the minimum for the listed perks.Tantalus will have free admission, so this campaign is the project's primary economic resource. Your generous contribution will bring this unique project to life and support a new company taking its first steps. In return, you will receive humble perks and our sincere gratitude for assisting in the realization of our artistic vision. *Please note: You can contribute to the campaign via PayPal even if you do not have a PayPal account.

<h3>The Dirty Blondes present THE AMERICAN PLAY</h3>
<p>Starring Shane Jensen, Jimmy Dailey, Rachel Napoleon, Brooke Bergen, Susan Bartolme, Cecilia Lynn-Jacobs, &amp; Tyler McClain</p>
<p>Sound design by Max Letaconnoux</p>
<p><em>The American Play</em> follows two college students, Tim and Luis, who bond over the author Bret Easton Ellis in American Lit class.  As the boys try to define themselves as men, their fantasies of a Patrick Bateman-like existence expose deep-seated insecurities and desperations that they will do anything to hide. The two-man play incorporates an all-female chorus to create a heightened, surreal, modern environment. </p>
<p>The piece is concurrent with the 20th anniversary of the release of <em>American Psycho</em>. It's a reactionary tale about the society we live in today, where women are made to feel like potential victims, a modern culture where the ""war on women"" is still being waged both privately and <span>publicly</span>.  </p>
<p>Created by women and told from a male perspective, <em>The American Play</em> asks what makes a man a monster.</p>

<p>Remember that Tamagotchi you worked so hard to keep alive and poop-free? Saving up to buy that limited edition Princess Di Beanie Baby? Hot Wheels?</p>
<p>Just like those long lost toys, theatre demands obsession. So come obsess with us, and remember what it feels like to be completely devoted to an experience, if only for a moment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>That Toy Pony is comprised of four members: Ashley Monroe, Blake Bishton, Greg Redlawsk, and Natalie Kropf</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<h3><strong>2nd Nature<br/></strong></h3>
<p>2nd Nature is a play written by Blake Bishton, directed by Greg Redlawsk, and developed by That Toy Pony. The play itself takes place in a small four bedroom apartment in Crown Heights in the midst of an otherworldly hurricane that has been battering the city for weeks. The occupants of the apartment are forced to overcome blackouts, Twinkie shortages, a girl (ew!), and a sexy, sentient laptop determined to take over the world, all the while strugging most with what it means to be alive and human in a world that has become so reliant upon technology.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>2nd Nature will be performing the second and third weekends in April. The perfomances will be taking place in a small Crown Heights apartment, with an audience capped at 15-20 members.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>This is That Toy Pony's first fully mounted production, and we need your help to get the ball rolling! The money we raise will be going directly to the play's production costs, and with your help we truly believe we'll be able to create something incredibly special and incredibly relevant. We thank you so much for your support, and we can't wait to share this piece with the public.</p>

The occupants of the apartment are forced to overcome blackouts, Twinkie shortages, a girl (ew!), and a sexy, sentient laptop determined to take over the world, all the while strugging most with what it means to be alive and human in a world that has become so reliant upon technology.
 
2nd Nature will be performing the second and third weekends in April. The perfomances will be taking place in a small Crown Heights apartment, with an audience capped at 15-20 members.
 
Impact
This is That Toy Pony's first fully mounted production, and we need your help to get the ball rolling! The money we raise will be going directly to the play's production costs, and with your help we truly believe we'll be able to create something incredibly special and incredibly relevant. We thank you so much for your support, and we can't wait to share this piece with the public.

<p><strong>Featuring: Liz Leighton, Emily Rindt, Tim Palecek, and Chen Chen</strong></p>
<p>A history of America in the 1980s, an idiosyncratic genealogy of punk rock music, and a personal narrative of growing up as an outsider, <strong><em>punkplay</em></strong> is a mix tape tribute to the excesses and energy of adolescence. Mickey, a thirteen-year-old suburban mist, is befriended by an angry runaway named Duck. Together, they boys attempt to reinvent themselves using punk rock, but as reality threatens to crash in on them, their fabricated world of amped-up music and shocking band names becomes just as oppressive as the society they're desperate to reject.</p>

A leather jacket, a prom dress, hair dye, and ROLLERSKATES are just a few of the items we need (bought used from thrift stores). There is an extensive prop list that includes massive amounts of records, tape cassettes, and comic books - as well as a model of a space shuttle, several puppets, and a rubber Ronald Reagan mask...</li>

<p><strong>Thank You for Checking Out Our Indiegogo Campaign!</strong></p>
<p>Hi we are Oh Dragon Theatre from Austin, Texas. We provide audiences with shows that highlight amazing performances and compelling stories.</p>
<p>Our next project is Sam Sheppard’s award winning play, <em>True West</em>. For our production we will be producing our show in The Magic Barn Fantastic, an amazing venue in the up and coming East Austin neighborhood.</p>
<p>We can only make this happen with the help of supporters like you. As a volunteer theatre company our visions come to fruition with the help of contributors who truly believe in the value of live theatre.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get!</strong></p>
<p>We need to raise $3,400 to make our production a reality. We're creating a set using a large amount of props. Due to the nature of the show, we will have to have extra props to replace ones that will be broken nightly. We also have to have cabinetry built for our kitchen set and provide our own lighting and seating which can prove to be costly additions.</p>
<p>The ensemble of <em>True West</em> will be working tirelessly to build set pieces, scavenge for props and costumes, and promote this amazing show. Below is list of all necessary costs for our production.</p>
<p>Venue - $900.00</p>
<p>Royalties- $900.00</p>
<p>Chairs- $360.00</p>
<p>Props and costumes- $360.00</p>
<p>Lighting- $330.00</p>
<p>Set - $250.00</p>
<p>Programs &amp; Advertisement- $100.00</p>
<p>Rehearsal space- $200.00</p>
<p>                                       Total goal = $3,400</p>
<p>Any amount you can contribute is a huge help. We also have some pretty sweet gifts if you donate to our campaign at certain levels. From a fond place in our hearts to the full VIP package, there is something for everyone! Check out all the great perks we have to offer!</p>
<p>Even if we don’t reach our goal, your contribution will go straight to production costs and help us make this production the best it can be.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>

Hi we are Oh Dragon Theatre from Austin, Texas. We provide audiences with shows that highlight amazing performances and compelling stories.
Our next project is Sam Sheppard’s award winning play, True West. For our production we will be producing our show in The Magic Barn Fantastic, an amazing venue in the up and coming East Austin neighborhood.
We can only make this happen with the help of supporters like you. As a volunteer theatre company our visions come to fruition with the help of contributors who truly believe in the value of live theatre.
What We Need & What You Get!
We need to raise $3,400 to make our production a reality. We're creating a set using a large amount of props. Due to the nature of the show, we will have to have extra props to replace ones that will be broken nightly. We also have to have cabinetry built for our kitchen set and provide our own lighting and seating which can prove to be costly additions.
The ensemble of True West will be working tirelessly to build set pieces, scavenge for props and costumes, and promote this amazing show. Below is list of all necessary costs for our production.
Venue - $900.00
Royalties- $900.00
Chairs- $360.00
Props and costumes- $360.00
Lighting- $330.00
Set - $250.00
Programs & Advertisement- $100.00
Rehearsal space- $200.00
                                       Total goal = $3,400
Any amount you can contribute is a huge help. We also have some pretty sweet gifts if you donate to our campaign at certain levels. From a fond place in our hearts to the full VIP package, there is something for everyone! Check out all the great perks we have to offer!
Even if we don’t reach our goal, your contribution will go straight to production costs and help us make this production the best it can be.

<p>Tallgrass Gothic is a haunting play about love, lust, and imminent reckoning in rural America.  Its gut-wrenching story was penned by Melanie Marnich and was first staged at the Actors Theater of Louisville.  </p>
<h3>Why Another Off-off-Broadway play? <strong style=""font-size: 10px;""><br/></strong>
</h3>
<p>Its heightened text and physical specificity make this play more than just your average play about unhappy rural Americans.  It has the emotional height of Eugene O'Neill with the irreverence of David Mamet. It's sincere, jarring, and deeply personal.</p>
<h3>Who is Grey Room?</h3>
<div>
<p class=""p1"">Grey Room is a new theater company interested in making immediate, engaging, and raw theater. We want to invite the audience in to make a space <em>with</em> us – that’s the grey room. In April we want to put in our grey room the play Tallgrass Gothic, by Melanie Marnich. It’s a romantic thriller of a bible-belt ghost story and we think you’ll like it.</p>
<p>Since graduating from our conservatory program at NYU together, we have been putting on a number of small projects, most of which we've built from the ground up. However, this is a unique moment for us because this is the FIRST FULL PLAY we are putting on with funds, space, and rights acquired entirely by ourselves.</p>
<h3>What's this money business about?</h3>
<p>We're broke! We spent our last pennies putting down a deposit on a beautiful theater space in the theater district of Manhattan and buying the rights to the play.  To make this happen, we really need a sweep of generosity to flow our way!  We need costumes, equipment, rehearsal space, a backseat of a car and so much more to make this production happen!  We're seeking help in any way.  Whether you want to come paint the set with us, or support our company as one of our honorary ""designers"" listed below, any and all is welcome support!  So far, the production team has been working round the clock to get pre-production secured.  We are fully dedicated to seeing this production come to fruition in the most conscientious, collaborative, and yes, frugal way possible.  Our goal, with the help of our visionary director Jake Beck, our judicious stage manager Matt Davis, and our proficient Producer Laura Barbiea, is to be as transparent and prudent as possible in this process.  See our ""perks"" below to get a real-budget comparison for how your money will be spent.</p>
<h3>What's in this for you?</h3>
<p>You're supporting the arts!  What a rapturously beautiful thing! Also, if you give above the $50 level, you will get a ticket (or two!) to see the New York premiere of this heart-pounding play!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What happens if we don't meet our goal?</h3>
<p>The show must go on!  We have the rights for the play, so we could end up wearing plastic bags and performing under the Queensboro Bridge. But we hope it won't come to that!  </p>

<p><strong>Campaign to Connect American Choreographers and Latin American Dancers</strong></p>
<p><span class=""notranlsate"">Dancers, choreographers and teachers in Latin America are working incredibly hard against the odds that keep them isolated- and they are hungry for more contact with the global dance community. They are also in need of exposure to the trends and developments that have occurred during many years of isolation. Like a band of travelers that has survived many hardships, they lack the resources that will bring them back to a more robust health and vitality, namely interaction with artists and companies that are vibrant examples of the art form in the 21st Century. But they also have incredible stories and a unique spirit to share with their North American counterparts.</span></p>
<p><span class=""notranlsate"">I-DANCE brings choreographers, teachers and performers from the USA to Latin American countries in order to promote an ""inspiration exchange"". Started in 2007, with a visit to Managua (Nicaragua) by internationally recognized dance teacher Kevin Irving, I-DANCE brings artists of stature to dance communities in Latin America with the goal of bridging the gaps that currently exist. We like to think of this as a ""Johnny Appleseed""-type approach - sowing the seeds of creativity to foster growth throughout the Latin American region. </span></p>
<p><span class=""notranlsate"">The creative impulse behind artistic expression through dance is remarkably similar the world over - but the crucial ingredient for the creation of meaningful and innovative dance often only arises from direct contact with artists that push dancers to explore beyond the boundaries of known experience.  In I-DANCE projects everyone gains from the increased contact as knowledge, experience and inspiration are shared through formal classes and performances, as well as the personal bonds that are quickly formed between dancers regardless of nationality, background or training.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Our Track Record</strong></p>
<p><span class=""notranlsate"">The 2010 project, which brought American performer and choreographer Lindsay Gilmore to Managua was a huge success, thanks to many generous donations. Lindsay not only created 2 short works while there, she also performed in the International Contemporary Dance Festival.  In 2011, renowned choreographer Nicolo Fonte, from Brooklyn, NY, created ""Codiciosos"" for Compani­a Nacional de Danza de El Salvador during a 1 week residency in El Salvador; that work has now been performed by CND on tour throughout Latin America and the Caribbean. I-DANCE also funded another return to Managua in 2011: Jennifer Chin, teaching the technique of Jose Limon, taught workshops in Managua, Granada and Diriamba and also performed in the International Contemporary Dance Festival.</span></p>

WHAT WE’RE DOING
 
THE PLAY
One of Sam Shepard’s most popular and critically acclaimed plays, Fool for Love is the story of one of theatre’s most infamous couples. Eddie and May have been rambunctious lovers for fifteen years; they are time-worn wheels on a rodeo trailer in the wilting American West. They cannot survive with each other or without each other. No simple love story, the play is also an investigation into the inheritance of family dysfunction. Shepard’s own family life was a source of sadness and a pain that has colored his entire playwriting career.  Fool for Love, which he wrote in sixteen drafts, (only adding a father figure in the final draft) bites the questions about what family is to the quick and leaves them bleeding on a rickety kitchen table, even after company comes over.
 
The play takes place in a grubby motel room, where May has been trying to stay on the wagon and get her life together when suddenly Eddie bursts through the door with tequila, a shotgun, a lasso, and spurs on his boots. He wants May back. Again. An Old Man watches from his chair beside the stage as May and Eddie come together. And pull apart. And make each other sick. And love each other harder than any two people have ever loved each other before. We would love to have you there for the ride.
 
THE POETRY
The play is not the only part of the show. Working together with local New York City poets and writers, we are planning a unique experience that combines both theatre and performance poetry. We have asked several poets to write pieces surrounding themes inherent in Fool for Love, giving it new, fresh voices. The poets will open up the evening with performances of poems that take place within the very motel room Eddie and May later tell their own story in. The result is an expansion of the dimensions and facets of the play and its characters; New Yorkers get to see their own city, their own people in Shepard’s world of the American West.

DAH Theatre is one of Europe’s most active political theatres
and was instrumental in the overthrow of the dictator Slobodan Milosevic with
its political actions. “Passing the Flame” celebrates the world of theatre
artists making a difference in the world through their art and activism. The
Spoleto Fringe, in its third year, coincides with the Spoleto Festival of Two
Worlds in the historic town in Umbria.



HaMapah/The Map has been invited to Dah’s “Passing the Flame” conference on theatre and peacebuilding because of the strife remaining in Serbia due to the war that fractured families and former Yugoslav society. There is much healing to be done in this region, especially for those citizens who embody multiple cultures. Similarly, the Spoleto Fringe has invited DNAWORKS because of the unique nature of the performance and current issues surrounding identity, heritage, and immigration in Western Europe.


HaMapah/The Map is a multimedia, genealogical dance journey, conceived of and performed by former Alvin Ailey American Dance Theatre dancer Adam McKinney, that traces his African American, Native American, and Jewish heritages. The performance is followed by a community dialogue that offers the audience an opportunity to share with each other their personal stories and reflect on the themes of the piece – identity, heritage, and ancestry.

<h2>Blacklight Burlesque Summer Tour 2013</h2>
<h3>The Ultraviolets Burlesque troupe is a black-light theater troupe that is very excited to share our unique, innovative, and sexy vaudevillian variety show with audiences outside of our little island home in Maui!</h3>
<p><img alt=""uv burlesque costume"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.ultravioletsburlesque.com/wp-content/uploads/alegra-bio-pic.jpg"" src="""" style=""margin: 2px; float: right;""/>Each act that we present to our audience is an original work of art created by the performers themselves. So much time and creativity goes into the conceptualization, the music selection, choreography, costuming, &amp; prop-making that make each act unique and entertaining. It's truly inspiring to work so closely with a group of amazing, self-reliant women who are constantly producing new material that showcases the variety of talents that we have within the troupe. </p>
<p>Through parody, song, comedy, dance, aerial performance, and magical visual illusions which are emphasized by the beauty of black lights, the Ultraviolets redefine human sexuality and creative expression in a extraordinary comedic and surrealistic way not seen before in burlesque.  Each act has a storyline to support the burlesque elements as well as handcrafted props and puppets that enhance the audience's entertainment.</p>
<p>""Silly is the new sexy,"" director Rachel Deboer says, ""we pride ourselves on empowering people through visually stunning props and costume media along with the live sensual themes and human relationship scenerios we make fun of and examine.""</p>
<h3>Not only do we entertain through burlesque and dance; we also incorporate magical illusions using the negative space of a black background and black light to make characters and props appear and dissappear.</h3>
<p>We will be kicking off our tour in Vancouver, Canada and traveling all down the west coast through Seattle, Portland, and the Bay Area.  Our goal of $6500 after all campaign fees will cover the initial plane flights needed (around $3600) to get our 6 versatile and spunky black light beauties to the mainland as we call it here in Maui. Also your donation is going towards purchase of a tour van ($2400) to transport our mistresses of the black light in between cities. Lastly, your kind donation to our kick off tour will help to bring mass levity and social healing through this completely visually vanguard and liberating expression for the modern day woman and man.</p>

The Ultraviolets Burlesque troupe is a black-light theater troupe that is very excited to share our unique, innovative, and sexy vaudevillian variety show with audiences outside of our little island home in Maui!
Each act that we present to our audience is an original work of art created by the performers themselves. So much time and creativity goes into the conceptualization, the music selection, choreography, costuming, & prop-making that make each act unique and entertaining. It's truly inspiring to work so closely with a group of amazing, self-reliant women who are constantly producing new material that showcases the variety of talents that we have within the troupe. 
Through parody, song, comedy, dance, aerial performance, and magical visual illusions which are emphasized by the beauty of black lights, the Ultraviolets redefine human sexuality and creative expression in a extraordinary comedic and surrealistic way not seen before in burlesque.  Each act has a storyline to support the burlesque elements as well as handcrafted props and puppets that enhance the audience's entertainment.
""Silly is the new sexy,"" director Rachel Deboer says, ""we pride ourselves on empowering people through visually stunning props and costume media along with the live sensual themes and human relationship scenerios we make fun of and examine.""
Not only do we entertain through burlesque and dance; we also incorporate magical illusions using the negative space of a black background and black light to make characters and props appear and dissappear.
We will be kicking off our tour in Vancouver, Canada and traveling all down the west coast through Seattle, Portland, and the Bay Area.  Our goal of $6500 after all campaign fees will cover the initial plane flights needed (around $3600) to get our 6 versatile and spunky black light beauties to the mainland as we call it here in Maui. Also your donation is going towards purchase of a tour van ($2400) to transport our mistresses of the black light in between cities. Lastly, your kind donation to our kick off tour will help to bring mass levity and social healing through this completely visually vanguard and liberating expression for the modern day woman and man.

About the Ultraviolets:
We are a cast of 6 women who share a unique theater vision concerning love, sex, relationships, and life.  Each member is a passionate artist in her field of  dance, improvisationsal comedy, aerial performance, song, and visual costume and prop design. 
For more information on individual performers, visit our website:ultravioletsburlesque.com
Enlightening the World One Flash at a Time:
We have created a ""Diary of an Ultraviolet"" blog that is featured on our website.  Each member has their own private and transformational stories to tell. As we travel and connect with audiences we will update our ""Diaries"" on our website to reach out to blossoming performers and humans alike in their search for creative self expression.  The Ultraviolets have taken Maui by storm by their style of burlesque and have been featured on the cover of Maui Time, Maui's largest independent publication as well as performed all over the island for thousands of people.
We feel we have a theatrical message and visual presence that is so original and needed in today's world. ""Sensuality can be funny and female clowns, dancers, and singers bringing that message to the masses is powerful and transformative"", says Rachel Deboer.

<h3>Who We Are...<br/>
</h3>kerPlunk dance is a contemporary dance company based in Queens, NY.  Constructed of five dynamic dames, we have Plunked our way from state to state along the East Coast in the past year.  Don't let the age of our company fool you.  Founded by Artistic Director Katherine Richardson in January 2010, we have spun out an impressive first year of performances and workshops, including Jacob's Pillow Inside/ Out stage and our own self produced show at New York City Center Studios.  <br/><br/>In 2010 kerPlunk dance met Andrew Sorg of the Atlantic Brass Quintet after performing at the Charles River Dance Festival in Boston.  Little did we know that our by-chance meeting would turn into an exciting artistic endeavor involving five kerPlunk dancers and the five musicians of Atlantic Brass Quintet.  The dancers of kerPlunk have already been working over the past several months creating phrases, developing subtext, and experimenting with how we can incorporate the presence of the musicians on stage.  <br/><br/>The Company:<br/><br/>Katherine Richardson- Artistic Director<br/>Sarah Wiechman - Rehearsal Director<br/>Meghan MacAlpine<br/>Jenny Gillan<br/>Michelle DuVall  <br/><br/>
</div><div>
<h3>What We're Doing...<br/>
</h3>
<br/>As an artistic collective we look to influences within time and space, 
unveiling our own personal histories by exploring the anamorphic range 
of the female body.  In our newly formed artistic partnership with the 
Atlantic Brass Quintet, kerPlunk dance will be working with ABQ to 
bridge the gap between historic and contemporary contexts buried within 
the structure of classical music.  The end result, a fresh program with an old-world feel that is inventive, intriguing, and celebratory of the evolution of performance art.   <br/><br/>The program itself will pay homage to 
the Baroque composer Pergolesi, with the presentation of Igor 
Stravinsky’s ballet Pulcinella Suite. The kerPlunk and Atlantic Brass 
collaboration will also feature the music and dance of the Balkan nations, a 
great brass music tradition of fascinating, dazzlingly virtuosic, and 
passionate music bound in Christian, Jewish, and Muslim traditions.  
This spirited music will be equally matched by the dancers mapping of a 
contoured world, brought to life through invigorating partnering, 
cascading ensemble work, and intimate stillness.    <br/><br/>Over the next year we will be developing the characters and or subtext of various small scenes that will be explored in the work.  We will begin by defining the space and the people who inhabit it through our interpretations of the music.  The coloring of the music lends itself well to the creation of defining various characters within each piece.  The dancers will deconstruct the melodies and embellishments that have become a characteristic of the various musical traditions in the program, and explore the foundation of each composition.  <br/>   <br/>As various sections of the program solidify we will be work-shopping/performing excerpts throughout the Summer and Fall of 2011 as well as traveling to and from Boston to work with the Atlantic Brass Quintet as we begin to integrate them into the staging of the work.  The finished program will culminate into an evening of live music and dance.  With proper funding we are looking to the beginning of 2012 as the starting point for performing this work at various venues.<br/><br/>
</div><div>
<h3>How you can Help!</h3>
<br/><br/><p>Box office sales only cover so much of our expenses of producing a show, let alone rehearsal rentals, dancer pay and travel.  Even though we are actively pursing a hand full of grants for this season, government funding of the arts as well as independents (fellowships, grants, etc) have been cut dramatically over the past few years.  Your generosity has and will continue to be our main source of income as a grassroots endeavor.     <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We are looking to raise a portion of our budget, $2,000, to cover the initial expenses of creating this body of work. Rehearsal space, insurance, dancer stipend, and travel for out of city rehearsals with the Atlantic Brass Quintet are just a taste of our preliminary expenses.  No donation is too small!      <br/></p>

<p>      ""...Equal parts provocative and hilarious, sobering and loving, this show tells our story of endless war through clowning."" <strong>Katherine Malachuk MBA, author of <i>You're Accepted</i></strong></p>
<p>      This project is inspired by interviews conducted with military veterans from USA, Israel and Canadian armies. It also includes the director's own experiences as an EMT in the Israeli military. In opposition to movies and popular media that portray the dramatic, violent or extreme moments of soldier’s lives, this project portrays the behind the scenes stories about the less known or ""heroic"" side of the military; moments that are mundane, tender and absurdly hilarious.</p>
<p>      The military structure demands many people to 'quiet down' or give up large parts of their personality whether it be their creativity, emotional expression, freedom of choice, and in many other ways. Clowning, on the other hand, is the exact opposite of military training. The clown fully experiences each moment and expresses their unique point of view to the audience. This project's goal is blend these two opposing worlds and show the hilarious possibilities that can arise.</p>
<p>      Racheli Mendelson, the play's director and writer is a native Israeli who has spent the last 4 years in Boulder, Colorado studying Performance and Peace studies at Naropa University. Her creation, <em>Shoot, Cry &amp; Forget About It! </em>is an attempt to reveal and celebrate soldiers' full humanity. It is dedicated to an audience of veterans, soldiers in active duty and civilians. By donating to this project your generosity will greatly help us promote a creative conversation about militarism and war. Our ensemble wants to end war and we think it’s possible through creative and expressive acts such as this performance. We believe that clowning and performance is one way to cultivate a strong connection to our aliveness, our humanity and to each other. Through this connection we can slowly but surely give up the old habit called war.</p>
<p> **This project is not designed to dishonor or criticize soldiers or veterans. It does however aspire to critique the military structure and the effects it has on the people who are in it (i.e. soldiers and other military personnel).</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Community Events:</h3>
<p>      The cast of Shoot, Cry&amp; Forget About It! in collaboration with Boulder Veterans for Peace and Colorado's Iraq Veterans Against The War will hold a community conversation during the Fringe Festival in Boulder Colorado this upcoming Fall. The goal of the conversation is to create a space where audience members can meet with veterans, share stories, and encourage community members to take part in these organizations that are working for peace. We believe that through creating close relationships with veterans and soldiers in active duty we can help demystify the experience of war, support soldiers, and eventually dismantle the military structure.</p>
<h3><strong>Campaign Funds!</strong></h3>
<p>Artist’s stipend: $3300</p>
<p>Space rental: $700</p>
<p>Props and costumes: $150</p>
<p>Marketing materials: $150</p>
<p>Note: as you can see most of the funds will be going directly to your beloved friend artists who are working so hard to bring more peace and creativity into our communities. Each one of these performers are highly trained and put in more than a hundred hours of <strong>voluntary</strong> rehearsal work towards this project already! AMAZING! These funds will help give them a small stipend to show respect for all their incredible and hard work. Please support artists and their livelihood!!! In case we don’t reach our goal most of the funds will still go to your beloved artists.</p>

      ""...Equal parts provocative and hilarious, sobering and loving, this show tells our story of endless war through clowning."" Katherine Malachuk MBA, author of You're Accepted
      This project is inspired by interviews conducted with military veterans from USA, Israel and Canadian armies. It also includes the director's own experiences as an EMT in the Israeli military. In opposition to movies and popular media that portray the dramatic, violent or extreme moments of soldier’s lives, this project portrays the behind the scenes stories about the less known or ""heroic"" side of the military; moments that are mundane, tender and absurdly hilarious.
      The military structure demands many people to 'quiet down' or give up large parts of their personality whether it be their creativity, emotional expression, freedom of choice, and in many other ways. Clowning, on the other hand, is the exact opposite of military training. The clown fully experiences each moment and expresses their unique point of view to the audience. This project's goal is blend these two opposing worlds and show the hilarious possibilities that can arise.
      Racheli Mendelson, the play's director and writer is a native Israeli who has spent the last 4 years in Boulder, Colorado studying Performance and Peace studies at Naropa University. Her creation, Shoot, Cry & Forget About It! is an attempt to reveal and celebrate soldiers' full humanity. It is dedicated to an audience of veterans, soldiers in active duty and civilians. By donating to this project your generosity will greatly help us promote a creative conversation about militarism and war. Our ensemble wants to end war and we think it’s possible through creative and expressive acts such as this performance. We believe that clowning and performance is one way to cultivate a strong connection to our aliveness, our humanity and to each other. Through this connection we can slowly but surely give up the old habit called war.
 **This project is not designed to dishonor or criticize soldiers or veterans. It does however aspire to critique the military structure and the effects it has on the people who are in it (i.e. soldiers and other military personnel).
 
Community Events:
      The cast of Shoot, Cry& Forget About It! in collaboration with Boulder Veterans for Peace and Colorado's Iraq Veterans Against The War will hold a community conversation during the Fringe Festival in Boulder Colorado this upcoming Fall. The goal of the conversation is to create a space where audience members can meet with veterans, share stories, and encourage community members to take part in these organizations that are working for peace. We believe that through creating close relationships with veterans and soldiers in active duty we can help demystify the experience of war, support soldiers, and eventually dismantle the military structure.

<h3>Scorched - A Fiery New Musical</h3>
<p>In an impossibly perfect kingdom, Princess and Prince encounter something wholly unfamiliar on the eve of their wedding: doubt. When the world as they know it goes up in smoke, Princess and Prince, King and Queen, dragons and witches are left to struggle with how and what to rebuild from the ashes.</p>
<p>With book/lyrics by Molly Houlahan and music/lyrics by Benji Goldsmith, <strong>SCORCHED is a whimsical examination of the stories we tell and how they shape us. </strong>A contemporary frame on a classic narrative, SCORCHED is a multi-generational show that will inspire millennials, parents, and children alike to reimagine what it means to seek a happy ending.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Team</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Our team consists of over thirty enthusiastic theater makers — musicians, producers, designers, and performers all united by a belief in the power of good storytelling.</strong> Many members of our creative team met at Yale, and the full team comes from a diverse set of backgrounds, with experience at the Public Theater, the A.R.T., Williamstown Theatre Festival, Disney Theatrical Group, Second Stage Theatre, the Eugene O'Neill Theatre Center, and more.

<h3>The Araca Project</h3>
<p>SCORCHED has been chosen as a member of the sixth season of The Araca Project, an initiative by the Araca Group to foster the growth of young producers. This summer, our producing team attended a week of producing intensives designed to help us get our show off the ground in the best way possible. Additionally, the Araca Project provides our theater space and serves as a source of guidance along the journey of producing SCORCHED. To learn more about The Araca Project and the other shows performing this season, <a href=""http://aracaproject.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">visit their website</a>.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our total budget is $25,000. Because we have just five performances, ticket revenue will only account for a small portion of our full budget. <strong>We aim to raise $9,000 through our Indiegogo campaign</strong>, with the remainder coming from individual donations.</p>
<p>Our budget consists of three major categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Artist Stipends</strong> - $6,000<ul><li>Our production team is composed entirely of young artists. We believe that it is of the utmost importance to compensate all creative professionals for their work, and this is especially true for emerging artists who are too often shoehorned into working for free with the promise of gaining experience and exposure. As excited as we are to provide our team with this invaluable opportunity to add to their portfolios, we are equally excited to help them pay the bills!</li></ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Production</strong> - $15,000<ul><li>Although Scorched exists in a fairy tale kingdom, we need real-world resources to bring it to life. Production expenses range from build materials such as lumber, paint, and fabric to sound and lighting equipment to rehearsal space rentals.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Marketing, Administrative, Miscellaneous</strong> - $4,000<ul><li>Our miscellaneous business expenses include creation of marketing materials, fees associated with our website, program printing, trucking, and more.</li></ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>With your help, we are confident that we can create the premiere production SCORCHED deserves.</strong> In addition to the ability to support this show, we're also offering our donors some fabulous <strong>perks</strong> (which can be found in the column to the right).</p>
<ul>
<li>Your donation will be <strong>tax-deductible</strong> thanks to our fiscal sponsor, Fractured Atlas.</li>
<li>You can also receive behind-the-scenes SCORCHED content by following our <strong>social media platforms</strong> (<a href=""http://facebook.com/scorchedmusical"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Facebook</a>, <a href=""http://instagram.com/scorchedmusical"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Instagram</a>, <a href=""http://twitter.com/scorchedmusical"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Twitter</a>) and by <a href=""http://scorchedmusical.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">visiting our website</a>.</li>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>By backing SCORCHED,<strong> you will be supporting a passionate group of young theater makers and helping bring this phenomenal show to life.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Everyone working on this show is a young artist eager for a platform on which to display their incredible talent. By donating, you allow us to produce this show at the scale that will provide the most fulfilling process for all involved. </li>
<li>We believe in the impact of theater. <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Our audience is anyone who has ever been told, has told, or will tell a fairy tale.</span><font><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> Employing themes of gender and sexuality, perception and identity, SCORCHED evokes all the nostalgia of fairy tales while also imploring us to reconsider the truths we've always been told. We hope for SCORCHED to propose a new, updated fairy tale for the next generation. Help us craft and spread this powerful </span>message of celebrating<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> difference and breaking convention. </span></font>
</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There are many challenges involved with producing any show, let alone a brand new musical in New York City; difficulties such as issues with equipment rentals, manpower limitations, and condensed rehearsal timelines can impact productions of all sizes. <strong>Our team feels especially well-prepared to face such challenges head-on.</strong> The producing team alone shares more than ten producing credits among them, and all held major leadership positions in one of the oldest and largest undergraduate theater organizations in the country. Additionally, every member of our team has significant experience in their respective field. We are confident in our abilities to overcome each and every obstacle that comes our way.</p>
</div><div>

</div></div>","Scorched - A Fiery New Musical
In an impossibly perfect kingdom, Princess and Prince encounter something wholly unfamiliar on the eve of their wedding: doubt. When the world as they know it goes up in smoke, Princess and Prince, King and Queen, dragons and witches are left to struggle with how and what to rebuild from the ashes.
With book/lyrics by Molly Houlahan and music/lyrics by Benji Goldsmith, SCORCHED is a whimsical examination of the stories we tell and how they shape us. A contemporary frame on a classic narrative, SCORCHED is a multi-generational show that will inspire millennials, parents, and children alike to reimagine what it means to seek a happy ending.

The Team


Our team consists of over thirty enthusiastic theater makers — musicians, producers, designers, and performers all united by a belief in the power of good storytelling. Many members of our creative team met at Yale, and the full team comes from a diverse set of backgrounds, with experience at the Public Theater, the A.R.T., Williamstown Theatre Festival, Disney Theatrical Group, Second Stage Theatre, the Eugene O'Neill Theatre Center, and more. To learn more about everyone working on our show, please visit our website.

Molly Houlahan - Director & Writer/Lyricist Molly Houlahan just finished the year as the Bret C. Harte Directing Fellow and the assistant to the Artistic Director at Berkeley Repertory Theatre, where she assisted Sean Graney on The Hypocrites’ The Pirates of Penzance, Daniel Sullivan on Macbeth starring Frances McDormand and Conleth Hill, and Mary Zimmerman on Treasure Island. She has also assisted Kate Whoriskey on Sweat by Lynn Nottage at both Oregon Shakespeare Festival and Arena Stage. She previously worked with The Public in the Producing Department and at Steppenwolf Theatre Company. Her directing work has been featured in FringeNYC, TinyRhino Short Play Festival and New York Theatre Workshop’s Jonathan Larson Lab. Molly won the Louis Sudler Prize for Excellence in the Performing and Creative Arts upon graduating from Yale.

Benji Goldsmith - Composer & LyricistBenji Goldsmith is currently an MFA student in NYU’s Graduate Musical Theatre Writing Program. He began performing at a young age, singing in the Metropolitan Opera Children’s Chorus from 2000-2005, and, as a pianist, has won several competitions and performed at Carnegie Hall’s Weill Recital Hall. Benji studied Composition at Yale and with a focus on Music Direction. He music directed several musicals such as the Mainstage productions of Hair and The Drowsy Chaperone, while also spending five summers working as a Music Director and Teaching Artist at Acting Manitou, a summer theater program in Waterville, ME. Benji was also the Musical Director of the Yale Whiffenpoofs, the oldest a cappella group in the United States. As a composer and lyricist, Benji has written three full-length musicals, The Average Achievers (with bookwriter Jonathan Karpinos,) Swamplandia! (with bookwriter Andrew Bezek,) and, of course, Scorched. He is a recipient of the ASCAP Foundation Morton Gould Young Composer Award, Yale’s Beekman Cannon Friends of Music Prize, and NMI’s New Voices Project.

The Araca Project
SCORCHED has been chosen as a member of the sixth season of The Araca Project, an initiative by the Araca Group to foster the growth of young producers. This summer, our producing team attended a week of producing intensives designed to help us get our show off the ground in the best way possible. Additionally, the Araca Project provides our theater space and serves as a source of guidance along the journey of producing SCORCHED. To learn more about The Araca Project and the other shows performing this season, visit their website.
What We Need & What You Get
Our total budget is $25,000. Because we have just five performances, ticket revenue will only account for a small portion of our full budget. We aim to raise $9,000 through our Indiegogo campaign, with the remainder coming from individual donations.
Our budget consists of three major categories:


Artist Stipends - $6,000Our production team is composed entirely of young artists. We believe that it is of the utmost importance to compensate all creative professionals for their work, and this is especially true for emerging artists who are too often shoehorned into working for free with the promise of gaining experience and exposure. As excited as we are to provide our team with this invaluable opportunity to add to their portfolios, we are equally excited to help them pay the bills!


Production - $15,000Although Scorched exists in a fairy tale kingdom, we need real-world resources to bring it to life. Production expenses range from build materials such as lumber, paint, and fabric to sound and lighting equipment to rehearsal space rentals.


Marketing, Administrative, Miscellaneous - $4,000Our miscellaneous business expenses include creation of marketing materials, fees associated with our website, program printing, trucking, and more.


With your help, we are confident that we can create the premiere production SCORCHED deserves. In addition to the ability to support this show, we're also offering our donors some fabulous perks (which can be found in the column to the right).

Your donation will be tax-deductible thanks to our fiscal sponsor, Fractured Atlas.
You can also receive behind-the-scenes SCORCHED content by following our social media platforms (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter) and by visiting our website.


The Impact
By backing SCORCHED, you will be supporting a passionate group of young theater makers and helping bring this phenomenal show to life.

Everyone working on this show is a young artist eager for a platform on which to display their incredible talent. By donating, you allow us to produce this show at the scale that will provide the most fulfilling process for all involved. 
We believe in the impact of theater. Our audience is anyone who has ever been told, has told, or will tell a fairy tale. Employing themes of gender and sexuality, perception and identity, SCORCHED evokes all the nostalgia of fairy tales while also imploring us to reconsider the truths we've always been told. We hope for SCORCHED to propose a new, updated fairy tale for the next generation. Help us craft and spread this powerful message of celebrating difference and breaking convention. 



Risks & Challenges
There are many challenges involved with producing any show, let alone a brand new musical in New York City; difficulties such as issues with equipment rentals, manpower limitations, and condensed rehearsal timelines can impact productions of all sizes. Our team feels especially well-prepared to face such challenges head-on. The producing team alone shares more than ten producing credits among them, and all held major leadership positions in one of the oldest and largest undergraduate theater organizations in the country. Additionally, every member of our team has significant experience in their respective field. We are confident in our abilities to overcome each and every obstacle that comes our way.

Other Ways You Can Help
We understand that not everyone is able to provide a fiscal contribution, but that doesn't mean you can't help us out in other ways!

Make sure to share this page with anyone who might be interested in donating (there are share tools at the top of the page).
Follow and share any our social media accounts to help us get the word out (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter).

</h3> <p></p>
<p><b>""More
Than All the World""</b> details the true story of England's King Edward II,
whose controversial 14th Century reign was wrought with scandal. His love for a
knight named Piers Gaveston was so mighty that his contemporaries referred to
Piers as Edward's ""husband"" some 700 years before marriage equality
started to spread across the Western World. This remarkably brazen love caused
such strife in his kingdom, that it led to Edward's forced abdication at the
hands of his wrathful wife, Queen Isabella, whom history has dubbed ""The
She-Wolf of France"". Our tale is rakishly narrated by famed 16th Century wordsmith
and raconteur Christopher Marlowe, who wrote a fearlessly candid play about
Edward II during his brief, lustrous career. <br/></p>
<p>Libertine Idol Productions has successfully
executed concerts, staged readings, backers auditions and full productions of
musicals in New York City since its founding in 2012. Until now, we have only
worked on small shows of eight actors or fewer but, with your help, we plan to
execute a world-premiere staged reading of our largest, most ambitious piece to date,
<b>""More Than All the World""</b>. The reading will be presented as part of
the acclaimed reading series at the illustrious <i>York Theatre Company</i> in Manhattan.
This is just the first step for a show that our team feels has a great deal of
promise for a future on stages in the U.S. and abroad, perhaps even the Great
White Way... Just think of the bragging rights if that happens! And, we're fiscally sponsored through Fractured Atlas, so all donations are tax-deductible! <br/></p>

believe <b>""More Than All the World""</b> has the potential to exceed even

<h3>MONEY &amp; RUN MARATHON</h3>
<h3>THEATER SCHMEATER CELEBRATES OUR 25TH SEASON</h3>
<p>We wanted to do something special for our 25th anniversary -   something Schmee, something unique, something BIG.</p>
<p>So we hit on the idea of presenting 3 different episodes of Wayne Rawley's hilarious action and adventure epic, <i><strong>Money &amp; Run</strong></i>. A late-night favorite at our old basement space in the early 2000's, we are excited to bring these shows back to life with two episodes on weeknights and all three episodes, back to back to back, on Saturdays, running from May 10th to June 10th, 2017.  </p>
<p>And as a special treat, each episode will feature a different cast! That's over 30 actors! For a little 50 seat theater like us, this represents a production akin to Cecil B DeMille's <i>Parting of the Red Sea</i>! Or the battle scenes in<strong><i> </i></strong><i>Lord of the Rings</i> (if they weren't CG'd!). In short, this IS BIG!</p>
<p>At best, box office revenue supplies about half the production costs for any given show; the other half is raised through other means.  A fraction comes from civic grant money, but the vast majority comes from individual donations - that is just a fact of life in non-profit arts.  So we are asking for your help in raising additional funds to produce our <i><strong>Money &amp; Run</strong></i> Marathon. We are determined to bring our audience the best show possible (the best things come in small boxes!) but to do so, to meet our standards, does take actual money.  Your generous donation will help pay for artist stipends, costumes, props, wood, paint, screws, lighting-- well, all the things that go into producing quality theater on the stage and off.</p>
<p>For 25 years Theater Schmeater has proven itself as the little theater that could. From operating in a basement garage overcoming financial ups and downs, to building a new home in Belltown, we have met our share of challenges and have come through even stronger. That is something to celebrate! Join the party with this special return of <i><strong>Money &amp; Run</strong></i> by Wayne Rawley - bigger and better than ever!  Because art, and laughter, and people, <i>are </i>important.</p>
<p>Please help us make this production the talk of the town.</p>
<p>We will see you at The Schmee!</p>

THEATER SCHMEATER CELEBRATES OUR 25TH SEASON
We wanted to do something special for our 25th anniversary -   something Schmee, something unique, something BIG.
So we hit on the idea of presenting 3 different episodes of Wayne Rawley's hilarious action and adventure epic, Money & Run. A late-night favorite at our old basement space in the early 2000's, we are excited to bring these shows back to life with two episodes on weeknights and all three episodes, back to back to back, on Saturdays, running from May 10th to June 10th, 2017.  
And as a special treat, each episode will feature a different cast! That's over 30 actors! For a little 50 seat theater like us, this represents a production akin to Cecil B DeMille's Parting of the Red Sea! Or the battle scenes in Lord of the Rings (if they weren't CG'd!). In short, this IS BIG!
At best, box office revenue supplies about half the production costs for any given show; the other half is raised through other means.  A fraction comes from civic grant money, but the vast majority comes from individual donations - that is just a fact of life in non-profit arts.  So we are asking for your help in raising additional funds to produce our Money & Run Marathon. We are determined to bring our audience the best show possible (the best things come in small boxes!) but to do so, to meet our standards, does take actual money.  Your generous donation will help pay for artist stipends, costumes, props, wood, paint, screws, lighting-- well, all the things that go into producing quality theater on the stage and off.
For 25 years Theater Schmeater has proven itself as the little theater that could. From operating in a basement garage overcoming financial ups and downs, to building a new home in Belltown, we have met our share of challenges and have come through even stronger. That is something to celebrate! Join the party with this special return of Money & Run by Wayne Rawley - bigger and better than ever!  Because art, and laughter, and people, are important.
Please help us make this production the talk of the town.
We will see you at The Schmee!

Shakespeare is a company formed by MFA graduates of the Shakespeare &amp;
Performance program of Mary Baldwin College in Staunton, VA.<span>  Seeking to work together after graduation,
the company will produce disparate productions across the country in 2013-14,
including performances in Staunton, Chicago, Austin, and the San Francisco Bay
Area.  These productions, that are led
and supported by the original Rovers currently spread across the country, will engage
local actors, theatre makers, and audiences within their own communities and on
a national level. Roving Shakespeare combines scholarly and acting training in
early modern theatre to bring a fresh perspective to Shakespeare and his
contemporaries, as well as plays inspired by early modern theatre.  <br/></span></p>

rehearsed and staged in a matter of 20 hours, before performing for the public
November 16<sup>th</sup> and 17th.  The
Renaissance Style of rehearsal attempts to recreate the rehearsal conditions of
Shakespeare’s time, consisting of short rehearsal time and no formal director
or designers. It gives modern audiences an opportunity not only to see a story
unfold, but literally theatre in the making.</span></p>

<p><span>Last year we saw musicians, vocalists, a film maker and a dancer open the show with a collaborative, multimedia original performance, all built from artists who met at SPARK.  We also closed the season with an improv jam hosting over 30 movers at the AFAC to bring audience and artists into the same playground.  </span></p>
<p>This year we want to achieve all of that and more!  With your help,  and a little luck, SPARK will present its 4th and most successful season yet.  We have opened the month of May with another SPARK hosted improv jam, bringing our past movers and their networks right into the heart of SPARK. At the end of May, we will host our first ever Works in Progress informal showing, where past SPARK artists can share their latest creative endeavors for a familiar and maybe not so familiar group of art lovers.  This provides our fabulous artists the chance to reconnect with fellow cast members, showcase their work for fresh eyes, ask questions and receive feedback about their work.  </p>
<p><b>Our 4th installment of SPARK will take place on September 30th and October 1, 2016 and we are thrilled to return to the AFAC in downtown Brooklyn.  Applications will be available for this season starting in June!</b></p>But before all of these exciting things, SPARK is seeking support in our efforts to continue our mission.  Your support not only continues to provide a performance experience for NYC artists, but keeps the conversation about networking alive.  We believe that artists thrive and advance in their careers when they are supported and collaborating with like-minded creative souls.

This year we want to achieve all of that and more!  With your help,  and a little luck, SPARK will present its 4th and most successful season yet.  We have opened the month of May with another SPARK hosted improv jam, bringing our past movers and their networks right into the heart of SPARK. At the end of May, we will host our first ever Works in Progress informal showing, where past SPARK artists can share their latest creative endeavors for a familiar and maybe not so familiar group of art lovers.  This provides our fabulous artists the chance to reconnect with fellow cast members, showcase their work for fresh eyes, ask questions and receive feedback about their work.  
Our 4th installment of SPARK will take place on September 30th and October 1, 2016 and we are thrilled to return to the AFAC in downtown Brooklyn.  Applications will be available for this season starting in June!But before all of these exciting things, SPARK is seeking support in our efforts to continue our mission.  Your support not only continues to provide a performance experience for NYC artists, but keeps the conversation about networking alive.  We believe that artists thrive and advance in their careers when they are supported and collaborating with like-minded creative souls. The right partnership can take a work from grassroots to revolutionary! Please take a moment to support us and our mission, as we seek to continue this important conversation in the NYC arts scene.    What We Need & What You Get 
Presenting a performance season is no simple task, as we have spent the past 3 seasons working and growing through this process!
It takes time, effort and, of course, funding.
Your support helps us pay for:
Theatre Rental in downtown Brooklyn.
Afterglow (after show) reception goodies
Theatre rental insurance
Independent contractor pay (our team!)
Programs
Publicity and marketing materials
Tech rehearsal rental
Studio rehearsal rentals
Travel costs associated with SPARK's expansion
And all the little things that come up, like providing our cast with water and snacks.    The Impact  SPARK was created by and continues to thrive from the support of artists and forward thinking art-lovers. 
Our goal represents our true need this season and we know that with help both big and small, we can achieve it.
We thank you for checking out our campaign and supporting our mission.    Risks & Challenges  We are proud to say we have hosted 3 sold out performance seasons in Brooklyn over the last 3 years, but growth is a whole different beast.
As we aim to make a bigger mark on the world around us, we have developed new ways to expand our network.

On May 6th, we hosted our 2nd Dance Jam, providing artists with a donation-based improvisation class where they can move, reconnect with fellow cast and meet new movers.  

On May 27th we will host our 1st ever Works in Progress showing where former cast come together to share, take risk and exchange.  

This summer, SPARK has been accepted to the Detroit Dance Festival to showcase work by SPARK co-founder Kate Bishop, performed with her other half, SPARK co-founder Martha Dobbs.  This trip will mark the beginning of a new relationship between SPARK and Detroit.  
In the coming years, SPARK aims to bring it's performance series to cities like Detroit and this is the beginning of that goal.      Other Ways You Can Help We understand that not everyone is in a place to give, but there are other ways you can support the SPARK 2016 season!

After two sell out productions A Working Title is ready to take on the UK. Twenty somethings across the country, in the middle of a quarter life crisis, need us and we need you!
It's about living in the city in a generation of renters, Tinder swipers, never-left-the-nesters, budget shoppers, internshipers, minimum wage workers, sofa surfers and daydreamers. It's about turning 25 and not having your sh*t together.

A Working Title is visiting Manchester, Camden and Edinburgh Fringe this summer, but we need some help. 


What We Need & What You Get

We need to raise money to cover all the little things you need to spend money on to put on a show:

- Venue Hire- Regestration Fee- Rehearsal Room Hire- Accommodation

These are our big outgoings and put us back a long way before the word profit can come into play. Profit means wages. Wages would be great!! 
In order to say Thank you for parting with your own hard earned cash we have put together some wonderful rewards. Please check these out!

The Impact
A Working Title was developed mostly by accident, growing from conversations between a motley collection of disillusioned twenty somethings, who all felt that everyone else in the world was much better at life than they were. 



We felt, at Original Impact, that much of the widespread upset and frustration we saw in our generation was down to the fact no one was talking about it. Everyone felt very much alone, which is easy as a young person in a big city. 
The trick, we thought, was letting everybody in on the big secret that, whatever your spotty sixteen year old self thought, no one ever really grows up. Even at the grand old age of twenty-five. Everyone is pretending (sometimes very convincingly) that they are real grown-ups who know what they’re doing, rather than letting on that they’re just making it up as they go along. 
And, being a theatre company, we made a show about it. 
Watching the reactions from the audience, it was very touching to see so many people leaving freer, happier and a little bit more content with their lot. In short they left knowing that it was all going to be ok, which is something we all need to hear sometimes. 
Your money, in helping us take our show to lots of different people, across the country, will help to spread that feeling, and hopefully make a bewildered and panicking generation just a bit happier. 
We couldn’t think of a better thing to invest in


Risks & Challenges


We are under no illusions about the fact that there are a lot of theatre companies out there, and there are a lot of things for people to go and watch, which does make our job a bit tricky. 
However, we have already proven, twice, that we can sell and, amazingly enough, sell out (and not just because our mums come every night). 
We think this is because we have a very clear audience. We know who they are, we can spot them in the street and be bang on with who will actually hang on to that flier. Anyone in their mid twenties, or anyone who remembers the pit falls of that age, we know will relate, and having a cracking night.

<p>The Puerto Rican Cultural Center (<a href=""http://prfdance.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://prfdance.org</a>) is the only center in Texas and the Southwest affiliated with the Institute of Puerto Rican Culture for ongoing cultural programming that could not otherwise be experienced in this region. Founded in 1997 by Taino blood-descendant Dr. Ana María Tekina-eirú Maynard, the mission of our nonprofit 501(c)(3) is to promote cultural awareness and pride through educational programs, performances, and cultural events based in folklore, history and traditions -- dance, music, community theatre, and indigenous cultural traditions. Since 2001, our achievement and quality have been validated by repeat support by the National Endowment for the Arts, an NEA Chairman's Award (2007), the Texas Commission on the Arts, the City of Austin through the Cultural Arts Division, and Humanities Texas (since 2011).</p>
<h3>ABOUT OUR PROJECT</h3>
<p>Each year our performing company, Puerto Rican Folkloric Dance (PRFDance) preserves and transmits oral history researched among Island elders who remember a past that has never been written down. Through community theatre featuring live music and dance, our plays give the community a vibrant vehicle to better embrace, learn, and retain history.   </p>
<p>On December 3 &amp; 4, 2016, Puerto Rican Folkloric Dance debuted our 14th bilingual play that shared the story of the first Boricua (Puerto Rican) Migration to Hawaii in 1900.  An original script based in oral and documented history, this play honored the brave men, women and children who went to Hawaii in search of a better life after Hurricane San Ciriaco devoured Puerto Rico in 1899.  </p>
<p>Recovery from Puerto Rico’s most destructive hurricane in history was not possible in any reasonable timeframe.  In a year’s time, 11 voyages would bring 5000 Boricuas to Hawaii, attracted by three year contracts to work the Hawaii sugar plantations.  Only 100 would ever return; those who remained  never forgot who they were -- Borinkis (of Boricua descent).</p>
<p>This original musical is the 14th bilingual play created by Dr. Ana Maria Tekina-eirú Maynard for PRFDance based in oral and documented history.  This year's play benefited from knowledge and memories shared by Jesus Reyes (Juncos, Puerto Rico), as well as Puerto Ricans living in Hawaii whose families were part of this history: Marian Montalbo and Kathy Marzan Montalbo (Hawai'i), and Clifford Pagan (Maui). </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>This production debuted on December 3-4, 2016 at Eastside Memorial Theatre in East Austin. Donations will subsidize production closing costs including (in priority order): tech crew, theatre and equipment rental (lights &amp; sound).</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Since 2004 we annually bring to life oral and little-known documented history through soul-stirring application of acting, folklore, and cultural traditions. Each year this project transmits history and cultural heritage to our community at large through a creative folk life experiences.  Our goal is to instill cultural awareness and pride, and shine a positive light on this unique slice of Hispanic culture.</p>
<p>Community theatre provides a vibrant vehicle for the community to embrace, be inspired by, and more easily learn and retain history. Through this project, all ages will enjoy the memories of elders preserved through an original play featuring folkloric music and dance. Each year, elders in our local community enjoy our original plays and share their own surfaced memories of a history their families were once a part of. Others enjoy learning about -- comparing and contrasting -- a history of struggle and triumph that resonates with their own cultural history.  The new generation becomes interested in learning more about a history they never knew. This project is important because Puerto Rico's rich culture has contributed much to the Americas. Our projects bring deeper understanding of ethnic origins shared across Hispanic cultures, to all who enjoy learning about them.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Funding is always a challenge in the arts community -- even more-so when serving a resource limited community.  Thankfully with generous donors, creative alternatives, and God's help, our 19 year history of high-quality artistic programming proves that we can succeed -- even in the toughest of times.

This original musical is the 14th bilingual play created by Dr. Ana Maria Tekina-eirú Maynard for PRFDance based in oral and documented history.  This year's play benefited from knowledge and memories shared by Jesus Reyes (Juncos, Puerto Rico), as well as Puerto Ricans living in Hawaii whose families were part of this history: Marian Montalbo and Kathy Marzan Montalbo (Hawai'i), and Clifford Pagan (Maui).

What We Need & What You Get
This production debuted on December 3-4, 2016 at Eastside Memorial Theatre in East Austin. Donations will subsidize production closing costs including (in priority order): tech crew, theatre and equipment rental (lights & sound).

The Impact
Since 2004 we annually bring to life oral and little-known documented history through soul-stirring application of acting, folklore, and cultural traditions. Each year this project transmits history and cultural heritage to our community at large through a creative folk life experiences.  Our goal is to instill cultural awareness and pride, and shine a positive light on this unique slice of Hispanic culture.
Community theatre provides a vibrant vehicle for the community to embrace, be inspired by, and more easily learn and retain history. Through this project, all ages will enjoy the memories of elders preserved through an original play featuring folkloric music and dance. Each year, elders in our local community enjoy our original plays and share their own surfaced memories of a history their families were once a part of. Others enjoy learning about -- comparing and contrasting -- a history of struggle and triumph that resonates with their own cultural history.  The new generation becomes interested in learning more about a history they never knew. This project is important because Puerto Rico's rich culture has contributed much to the Americas. Our projects bring deeper understanding of ethnic origins shared across Hispanic cultures, to all who enjoy learning about them.


Risks & Challenges
Funding is always a challenge in the arts community -- even more-so when serving a resource limited community.  Thankfully with generous donors, creative alternatives, and God's help, our 19 year history of high-quality artistic programming proves that we can succeed -- even in the toughest of times. We are grateful to those who help us be the ""little engine that can"" !!  

Other Ways You Can Help

<p>We are the Voyeur Theater Collective, an independent group started last year around the wild idea of creating performance events designed by our generation, for our generation. Theater in its undeniable beauty has unfortunately been overshadowed by the non-stop entertainment of a millennial’s life (i.e. smartphones, Facebook, video games, Netflix etc.) Our mission is to bring the attention of the current generation back to one of the oldest art forms. We will do this by integrating what is usually shunned from theater—phones, media, and video— into a show called about:blank. We hope to reach out to all millennials and get them interested in contemporary theater.<br/></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>The three biggest costs that we face in putting on this performance are renting out space for the event, design construction of our set, and obtaining a full sound system. These costs, along with costumes, props, promotional materials, and a few other small things comprise our total estimated budget of $5,000. We are starting from nothing, which means that we have less than two months to raise the capital that we need. Please help us achieve our dream of creating a life-changing performance!<br/></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>
<p>Our production will hopefully contribute to campus life by bridging the gaps between different social communities. All art can be experienced and discussed by its viewers, but live theatre is unique in that it physically brings people together for this exchange. VTC takes this notion a step further by bringing together a team of people with completely different worlds and mindsets within the Northwestern community. Bringing different mindsets together, and general inclusion, is essential to our mission because we believe the best learning that can be done is in a diverse environment. We hope to create a platform that will not only give the cognitive science and flute major the chance to meet, but also one that promotes discussion and exchange of ideas between them by presenting topics they can both relate to and speak knowledgeably about from their varying perspectives. </p>Additionally, VTC is now in it’s second year, and many of last year’s team members are now NU alumni, or students/alumni from other universities, who currently live and work in the greater Chicagoland area.  Though the production will be based at NU and primarily marketed to our community, the VTC community extends beyond our insular Evanston bubble. When members of last year’s team come back to support and engage with the work being created, they too are afforded the opportunity to share their unique views and responses, forging ties between NU students and a network of other artistically-inclined millennials in the area, making us more aware of our greater Chicago community and potentially opening NU students up to new opportunities. <br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As a fledgling organization in just its second year, Voyeur Theatre Collective is not eligible to receive traditional funding from Northwestern University.

<p>We
are a not-for-profit organization <span>using dance and music
to conduct cultural activities in New York City.  In 2012 we started a parents’ association to facilitate
contact among Japanese parents who are raising their children in New York and
who want those children to maintain contact with
Japanese culture.  This issue is not only
true for the Japanese, of course. In this country,
where varied cultures and races come together,
identity issues are common.  When we saw the innocent faces of the children at our
parents’ meetings, we were strongly moved to introduce
these children to their origins, a project that was
within our reach.</span></p>

<p>This was how this project was born. <span>Since that time, we offer a yearly concert in which we use dance and
music to present an ancient Japanese folktale.  We do not use any
speech since not all the participating
children are Japanese.  Many talented and
thriving Japanese professional artists in New York perform in the show.  Though all the
participating children will learn about Japanese culture, we hope that those
who are of Japanese descent will feel a special resonance as they learn about
their roots.</span></p>

<p>This
year, we presented “Urashima-Taro, A Fisherman’s Tale” <span>in which a young fisherman saves a turtle from
bullying children.  The turtle brings him
to a dragon’s palace at the bottom of the ocean. In the beautiful, mysterious world of the deep sea, what does he see and
experience? How does he think and act? And what happens to him?</span></p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p>Urashima Taro and Otohime, the Dragon Princess, were performed by magnificent ballet dancers. Turtle was performed by a fantastic hip-hop dancer/actor. And varied and talented dancers and singers supported the main characters.</p>

We
are a not-for-profit organization using dance and music
to conduct cultural activities in New York City.  In 2012 we started a parents’ association to facilitate
contact among Japanese parents who are raising their children in New York and
who want those children to maintain contact with
Japanese culture.  This issue is not only
true for the Japanese, of course. In this country,
where varied cultures and races come together,
identity issues are common.  When we saw the innocent faces of the children at our
parents’ meetings, we were strongly moved to introduce
these children to their origins, a project that was
within our reach.

(Photo from ""Kaguya-Hime"", 2014)
This was how this project was born. Since that time, we offer a yearly concert in which we use dance and
music to present an ancient Japanese folktale.  We do not use any
speech since not all the participating
children are Japanese.  Many talented and
thriving Japanese professional artists in New York perform in the show.  Though all the
participating children will learn about Japanese culture, we hope that those
who are of Japanese descent will feel a special resonance as they learn about
their roots.

This
year, we presented “Urashima-Taro, A Fisherman’s Tale” in which a young fisherman saves a turtle from
bullying children.  The turtle brings him
to a dragon’s palace at the bottom of the ocean. In the beautiful, mysterious world of the deep sea, what does he see and
experience? How does he think and act? And what happens to him?

Urashima Taro and Otohime, the Dragon Princess, were performed by magnificent ballet dancers. Turtle was performed by a fantastic hip-hop dancer/actor. And varied and talented dancers and singers supported the main characters.


(Urashima Taro Rehearsal - L-R Norihiro Maruta as the Turtle and Shogo Honda as Urashima Taro.)

(Urashima Taro, Rehearsal)

The
show is consists of many forms of music and
dance, as we produced the show for
everybody to enjoy, no matter their origins.  Most of the artists and staff are volunteers.
We do not create for money, but to express and share the best of ourselves. For us, creating
something from nothing is the most joyful of experiences. We create this
presentation to bring a shine to the children’s
eyes when they see the story unfolding on stage.
We
are trying to raise funds in all possible ways to make
this project possible to continue. We wished use the
money contributed for this production to invite as many children as possible as our guests. Although, we wished to gather enough money to make all seats, for children and for adults, free, unfortunately we could not achieve the goal before the presentation. Yet, many people came to see the show paying for it and had a great and moving time. And we wish to extend the show to everybody who could not come. If you donated more than $15, we will send you a video link of the show when it is ready. The donation is available from all over the world using your credit card. And your such contribution will make us to continue working on this project.
Please send your warm support and enjoy the show at your home with your family!

SACRA! ""Urashima Taro or A Fisherman's Story""Performed: Sunday, June 21st.Riverside Theatre, 490 Riverside Dr, New York, NY 10027



(Urashima Taro Rehearsal)

　私たちはニューヨークでダンスや音楽の文化活動を行う非営利団体です。2012年、私たちはニューヨークで子供を産み育てる日本人のために父母会を始めました。海外で子育てをする日本人の親たちの横の繋がりを作りたかったのです。集まった子供たちを見て、私たちはこの子たちが抱える宿命の一つに気づきました。この子たちは、アメリカの文化と言語の中で育つけれども、いつか自分が日本の血を引くことを意識して、自分が何者かを問う時がくるだろう、ということです。それはもちろん、日本人だけではありません。雑多な人種と文化が混然と同居するこの国で、誰もが抱くアイデンティティーイシューです。この子たちに心のふるさとを知らせるために、私たちに何ができるだろうと考えました。 


　こうしてこの企画、アーツキュア民話企画は生まれました。この企画では、日本に古くから伝わる民話をダンスと踊りで表現します。子供たちの両親は必ずしも日本人とは限りません。そのため、この舞台では全く台詞は使わないことにしました。ニューヨークで芸を磨き、活動する日本人アーティストが多く演じます。そして、ニューヨークで育つ子供たちも演じます。自らこの企画で演じながら、子供たちの心は物語の世界を泳ぐことでしょう。そして、自らの中に流れるルーツを知ってほしいと思います。


(Photo from ""Kaguya-Hime"" 2014)
　今年、私たちは「浦島太郎」を上演しました。亀を助けた心優しい漁師の浦島太郎は、その恩返しに亀に連れられ、竜宮城へ行きます。美しくも不思議な海中の世界。そこで太郎は何を見、何を経験したのでしょう？そして太郎は何を考え、どう行動したのでしょう？そして何が太郎に起こったのでしょう？

　浦島太郎と乙姫は素晴らしいバレエダンサーが、亀はパワフルなヒップホップダンサー件俳優が演じました。そして、この主役たちを様々なジャンルの実力あるダンサーや歌手が支えています。
(Urashima Taro Rehearsal)
 

　舞台は様々な音楽と踊りで構成されます。音楽やダンスは世界中に通用する共通伝達手段です。国境を越えて、誰もが楽しめる舞台に仕上がりました。出演するアーティストや製作するスタッフのほぼ全員がボランティアです。私たちはお金のために作品は作りません。自分の心の表現のために、そしてそれを人々と分け合うために作品を作ります。そして、そのためには自分の全てを注ぎます。私たちにとって、何もないところから形あるものを作ることはこの上もない喜びなのです。私たちは舞台の上に物語を展開させ、多くの子供たちの目を輝かせるために、この製作を実現させ続けたいと思います。


(Urashima Taro Rehearsal)
　しかし、舞台を実現させるためには、大変な費用がかかります。最低限の条件を満たす舞台にするために、私たちはあらゆる方法で資金を集めようとしています。ここに掲げる＄5,000という目標は、全席を無料にし、少しでも多くの子供たちを招待するためのものでした。しかし、残念ながら今年はこの目標を公演前に達成することはできませんでした。それでも多くの人たちが$15/席のチケット料金を払ってこの舞台を見に来てくれ、そして多くの感動を得て帰ってくれました。この舞台を見られなかった人は、決して手遅れではありません。もし、これからこのサイトで$15以上寄付してくださった方には、この公演のビデオリンクをお送りします。
　海外に住む子供たちに心のふるさとを見せてあげるために、是非皆様の暖かいご支援をお願い致します。ご自宅でリラックスして、ニューヨークで行われたこの公演を、ご家族でお楽しみください！

This is a story about a boy and a girl. It’s sometimes about a dog instead. There are words, and there’s music. I am trying to tell you something about sound. About making it, and about hearing it. About language and other auditory connections. I am trying to tell you something. I’d like you to listen.
I began Fundamental Frequencies in “Sound of Words,” a writing class that focused on the intersections between writing and music. The piece alternates between two different stories, united by the idea of auditory relationships, the role that sound and music plays in human interactions.
After a couple years of working on the story, I realized it needed more than words. To fully embody this story and its message, I needed to incorporate live performance and sound.
About the Show

Through Hybridge Arts Collective’s Blueprint Breakout Series, I’m creating a theater and music performance with the help of composer and musician Joo Won Park. Fundamental Frequencies will remind people that language isn’t everything. It’s not our only tool for communication. It’s not the only thing that matters. And it sure as hell isn’t as precise as you think.
As a writer, I believe that the meaning of a word depends on myriad factors. I believe word choice and even sounds matter as much as plot. Working on Fundamental Frequencies as part of the Blueprint Breakout Series will force me to defend that claim on new levels, to explore auditory relationships in a way that emphasizes sound beyond words.
It’ll also force me to think of an ungodly number of music puns until this is funded.

My dance writing has been published on Thinking Dance, and I help publish other local writers with APIARY Literary Magazine. I’ve also worked with students at Mighty Writers, Mighty Post, and Camp Sojourner Girls’ Leadership Camp. You can check out my blog at viciousandmultiple.blogspot.com.
About the Money
Money can’t buy me love. But it can pay for artistic costs like fees for performers, a musician/composer, and outside eyes, production costs like lighting, set, and costumes, and marketing costs like a graphic designer, photographer, and videographer to get the word out there. This is the first time I’m committing to paying the folks I work with, and I’m pretty darn psyched about that.

Performing Tribute 9/11: Ordinary People,
Remarkable Stories 
On September 11th I lost my cousin who worked for
Cantor Fitzgerald in the North Tower. 
In 2005 I began volunteering with the Tribute Center WTC visitor center. Tribute
has a unique mission they call “person to person” history.  Every volunteer has a personal
connection to 9/11 and we lead tours of the site, stopping to tell our personal
stories during the tour.
It was volunteering with Tribute that gave me the idea of
creating a piece of theatre that would weave together several stories of
9/11.  My concept for Performing
Tribute has always been that the play would be performed by the actual
people who experienced 9/11 and not by actors.  Performing Tribute presents the perspectives of 8 individuals who were separately yet directly impacted by the events of 9/11— family members who lost loved ones; survivors of the North and South Towers; an evacuated area resident; a retired FDNY firefighter who responded to the site, a New Jersey resident who volunteered in the aftermath with the Salvation Army and volunteers who helped in the rescue and recovery.  The individual experiences are told first-hand in a theatrical presentation that shares these unique and inspiring responses to 9/11. 
Performing Tribute was first produced by the Tribute Center in
2008 at Tribeca Performing Arts Center. 
It has since been presented at a few Long Island High Schools and at the annual
NY Fire Chief’s convention.
To commemorate the 10th anniversary of September 11th we have organized 5 free performances of Performing Tribute in New York City and New Jersey.   
The Impact


Everyone involved in Performing Tribute feels strongly that the stories of 9/11 must be told and that the 10th anniversary year is a unique opportunity for us to honor those we lost.  In addition to the five free performances we have organized in Manhattan and New Jersey we have also created a 30-minute version of the script that we are distributing, also free, to High Schools across the US to stage their own reading for the 10th anniversary.



""I really thought late, late that night on September 11 that
my life was over.  But I hold in my
heart a story my grandmother told me. Her youngest brother fought over in
Germany in WWII, and he had a young wife at home and they had no children. He
used to write her letters and in one of the last letters he wrote her, before
he was killed in the war, he said if something happens to me, don’t let this
war ruin two lives.  They took
2,750 lives at the World Trade Center that day but they didn’t take mine.  And I think it’s a credit to all those who died to make the most of this life."" - Kate R., Performing Tribute

A story of adventure and empowerment.




I'm Brigette Cormier, the choreographer and director of JOAN: The Ballet. Miami based professional dance artists and myself take on my original independent dancework JOAN: The Ballet in a soft premier performance at the RIFT Blackbox Theater Nov 1st & 2nd. I have been developing this 60 minute ballet since 2011, and recently through the Pioneer Winter Collective and Jared Sharon at the RIFT Black Box Theater, I was able to participate in a work exchange, teaching ballet & tap classes for children, for a discounted theater rental and a reduced rehearsal space rate for the soft premier. 







 Inspired by the Salem Witch Trials and Joan of Arc, & led by my passionate curiosity, JOAN: The ballet is a series of dances focusing on strength, perseverance, and forgiveness. Through the language of contemporary ballet and modern dance, a passionate story of friendship and awareness emerges bridging contemporary concepts with historic expressions.
The Details
We need to raise $1,800
As the creator of JOAN: The Ballet I understand that the funding needed to produce this independent work is coming from my pocket. With your help, I will provide a modest stipend to all the artists involved for their participation and time investment.  In addition, this is the Miami soft premiere of JOAN: The Ballet; Your contribution will help make this production a success. We hope to reach our goal and to, potentially, surpass it!
The Breakdown:
Compensation to the artists- $1,300
Costuming & Props- $300
Flyer/Postcards- $200
Additional funds after $1,800 will go towards our next performance of JOAN.


If you donate to our campaign your perks can include original autographed photos of the dancers in action, an invitation to view a sneak peak of JOAN in a rehearsal,  and tickets to our show!
If we don't reach our entire goal I will compensate out of my pocket.




Other Ways To Help
The greatest support we can receive is to have you seated in our audience.  Even if you are unable to contribute personally to Indiegogo, we hope that you will pass along this link.  Please share this campaign on Facebook, Twitter, or to friends via Email.  Most importantly, help us spread the word about JOAN: The Ballet and fill the house!  Tickets can be purchased here or at the link JOANtheBallet.eventbrite.com

The Impact 
I feel my project is a valuable contributor to my community. Energy is contagious, and the message in JOAN: The Ballet is one of peace, unity, and equality for all, so I hope that this energy will resonate widely. When my dancers and I present this ballet, we hope that our vibration of love and change will cause a ripple effect of peace across the globe. We've only had one other indiegogo campaign before, and it went great! I raised money to build dance studio/theater inside of a warehouse, and that's where I created the first half of JOAN: The Ballet.

Education Ourtreach and Community Engagement- Dominique Salerno spearheaded a weekly Improv Initiative for underserved high school students and has launched a sustainable program for both current students and alumni; Josie Alvarez organized an annual residency at a local elementary school, E.R. Taylor. 

 International Artistic Dialogue- Kemiyondo Coutinho took her one-woman show ""Kawuna... You're It"" to The South African National Arts Festival Grahamstown- one of the largest international festivals in the world- and created her own festival Nuvo in her hometown of Kampala, Uganda; Ben Quinn starred in Half: A Divorce Farce in the Rome Fringe Festival directed by Dominique Salerno. 


Sharing Talents Nationwide- Glenn Stott was a featured lead in the Livermore Shakespeare Festival's Summer Repertory Season (Pride and Prejudice, Much Ado About Nothing); Danielle Frimer has worked multiple summers in Portland, Oregon with Post5 Theater Company  as a featured lead (Love's Labours Lost, Twelfth Night); Ryan Williams-French has worked as a featured lead in Chautaqua Theatre Company's Summer Residency, and will be touring A.C.T's production of Mr. Burns at The Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis. 

These are just a few of our past accomplishments, and your support can help us continue work like this... and much more! 


Challenges
Being a professional actor means waking up everyday and putting your art first, wearing your heart on your sleeve, and making personal sacrifices to do what you love.  Financial support can be invaluable in providing a secure environment for creativity to flourish. Your patronage of our artistic paths can significantly diminish these challenges  and provide a springboard for our success.

<h3><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">The World Premiere</span></h3>
<p>Three years ago, <strong><em>The Unfortunates</em></strong> was presented as a staged reading in the Women Playwrights Festival at Centenary Stage Company. Winning the festival gave <em><strong>The Unfortunates</strong> </em>its world premiere in 2012. I had the pleasure of being that one woman in both the reading and the premiere. From the moment I read the play, I was drawn to the incredible story. The victims of Jack the Ripper were marginalized, sensationalized, or ignored women.   As Janine M. Torsiello of Morrisbeats noted in her review: ""...A woman in the audience thanked the playwright, Aoise Stratford, for giving the women who were the Ripper's victims back their lives. Indeed she did that very well, and because of that, this is a production not to be missed.""</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p><strong>Aoise Stratford</strong>, international-award winning Playwright. <span>Aoise's work has been produced in Canada, Austria, Italy, Australia, Belgium, England, and throughout the USA. <span>She is a member and regional representative of the Dramatists Guild and her work has been published by Smith and Kraus, JAC, United Stages and Merriweather Press.</span></span></p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>FringeNYC handles the venue costs, and Centenary Stage Company is lending Mary Jane her costume (thank you very much!), but we still need to recreate the Ten Bells pub at its most desolate:</p>
<ul>
<li>We need to build a new bar to fit the new venue, because what's a pub without a bar? Also stools, tables, chairs, liquor bottles, glasses...</li>
<li>The eerie sounds of the abandoned bar don't just happen--we need a fabulous sound designer to make them happen</li>
</ul>
<p>And then there are fees associated with the FringeNYC itself:</p>
<ul>
<li>participation fees</li>
<li>insurance</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>The Unfortunuates</em></strong> will be an amazing production, but people need to hear about it! So there's <em><strong>marketing. </strong></em>New York is a big theater town, and the FringeNYC is a big festival, so it takes a good marketing campaign to stand out, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Print ad in the FringeNYC program</li>

<em style=""letter-spacing: 0.06em;"">Dig Infinity!</em><br/>
</h3><p><strong><em>Dig Infinity!</em></strong> is a stage play celebrating the legacy of Lord Buckley (1906-1960), a nearly forgotten jazz comedian, visionary storyteller/philosopher, hipster saint and premier beatnik rapper. Lord Buckley was best known for transforming Bible stories, Shakespeare soliloquies, the Classics, myth, legend and history into one-of-a-kind hip-talk monologues combining African-American street argot and the King’s English into a jazzy patois and worldview that anticipated psychedelia and rap by decades. ""Jonah &amp; The Whale,"" ""The Hip Gahn,"" ""Scrooge,"" ""Hipsters, Flipsters &amp; Finger-Poppin' Daddies,"" and ""The Nazz"" are just a few of his hallmark monologues that are the stuff of bohemian fable.</p><p>
</p><p><i><b>Dig Infinity!</b></i> transpires in a surreal radio station where, on the midnight after his death, Lord Buckley spins out his life story to a DJ named Orpheus while demonstrating his signature material. As the two talk, a dialogue interspersed with flashbacks to various points in Lord Buckley's life, the conversation shifts into a discussion about the importance of truth and art, a topic which includes a trip to Hades and a cameo by God as it becomes increasingly apparent that Lord Buckley is bargaining for his very soul.</p>
<p>Lord Buckley’s life and art remain so resonantly timely and why each new generation seems to rediscover and revere his legacy are the ways in which it confronts and comments on controversial components of contemporary American life: religion, language, art, sex, drugs, and race. Yet despite being a secret subterranean hero to the likes of Bob Dylan, the Beatles, Grateful Dead, Robin Williams, Bill T.

<h3>Who am I am why do I need you?</h3>
<p>Aren James Hooper, Alumni of UNM's department of Theatre and Dance is coming back fall of 2013 to set a new work in the alumni show. </p>
<p>After graduating Mr. Hooper moved to NYC and has since danced with two active professional companies and done many projects throught the dance community including starting his own not for profit dance company--DOTA Dance Theatre. </p>
<p>Aren will return to New Mexico in the fall to set a work for the Friends of Dance Alumni show with a cast of incredible movers from the community. This Indie gogo campaign will raise funds to fully support the creation of this work! Thank you. </p>

<div>
<h3>What:</h3>
<p>So here is the deal. Without funding the show will still go on, BUT (there is always a catch) if we don't make this funding goal the dancers will not be paid (ARTISTS NEED TO EAT TOO), props will be non existent, AND they MAY be dancing naked. Basically, all of the funding from this indiegogo will support the wonderful work of my dancers in New Mexico. Without their time and energy this work would not be a success</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Why:</h3>
<p>The purpose of any work created by DOTA Dance Theatre is to expand appreciation for the arts, specifically the marraige of film and concert dance, and this work follows suit. This work will be produced for an alumni show at the University of New Mexico in association with the Friends of Dance organization and will bring together dancers from the community to showcase a multimedia dance experience available to the community (and later online at <a href=""http://www.dotadancetheatre.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.dotadancetheatre.com</a>)</p>

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><p>Theatre artist Amy Crumpacker has been heading up groups of people since 2006 making community based theater, which is: by, of, and for the people. Working as the award winning Not Your Grammy's Theater, for the last 4 years in the Bayview/Hunters Point District of San Franicisco--a district going through tremendous change of demographics--we've collected stories from the many cultural groups in the district. We've written scenes, created a diverse ensemble of adult community members partnered with professional actors, and shared a few of our rehearsals with the community. Our goal is to get the grants needed for completion of our '<strong>Love</strong> <strong>Lett</strong><strong>er to Bayview</strong>' project in the fall of 2013. We have a portable set, and respected partners—YMCA, Quesada Gardens Initiative, Infinity Productions, resident theater company of the Bayview Opera House. All we need is some financial support for the stipends for our grant writer and our youth intern. All we need is you! </p>
<p>  </p>
<p>We at Not Your Grammy's Theater are seeking funds to give a $500 stipend to our grant writer for writing this season's grant and proposal applications. We are seeking $200 for our youth administration intern. This intern will be from the Willie Mays' Boys and Girls Club, and will give job skills to a local young person and help out NYGTheater at the same time.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Impact:</p>
<p>Our <strong>Love Letter</strong> is all inclusive of all groups in the Bayview:  Artists, Business Owners, Homeless, Whites, African American, Chinese, Latino, Pacific Islander, Police, Criminals, and that's what makes our oral histories and scenes different from the rest of the community based projects in our village of the Bayview.  Already we've brought together individuals who would not normally be in the same room together, and dialogues have started for community change.  We are teaching artistic skills to adults, a sometimes underserved group in the world of community programs.   </p>
<p>Feel free to give as little or large as you can, as we get all funds from this campaign, whether we reach our goal of $700 or not.  And please share our campaign!</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<h3><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;""> </span></h3></div>","Theatre artist Amy Crumpacker has been heading up groups of people since 2006 making community based theater, which is: by, of, and for the people. Working as the award winning Not Your Grammy's Theater, for the last 4 years in the Bayview/Hunters Point District of San Franicisco--a district going through tremendous change of demographics--we've collected stories from the many cultural groups in the district. We've written scenes, created a diverse ensemble of adult community members partnered with professional actors, and shared a few of our rehearsals with the community. Our goal is to get the grants needed for completion of our 'Love Letter to Bayview' project in the fall of 2013. We have a portable set, and respected partners—YMCA, Quesada Gardens Initiative, Infinity Productions, resident theater company of the Bayview Opera House. All we need is some financial support for the stipends for our grant writer and our youth intern. All we need is you! 
  
We at Not Your Grammy's Theater are seeking funds to give a $500 stipend to our grant writer for writing this season's grant and proposal applications. We are seeking $200 for our youth administration intern. This intern will be from the Willie Mays' Boys and Girls Club, and will give job skills to a local young person and help out NYGTheater at the same time.
 
The Impact:
Our Love Letter is all inclusive of all groups in the Bayview:  Artists, Business Owners, Homeless, Whites, African American, Chinese, Latino, Pacific Islander, Police, Criminals, and that's what makes our oral histories and scenes different from the rest of the community based projects in our village of the Bayview.  Already we've brought together individuals who would not normally be in the same room together, and dialogues have started for community change.  We are teaching artistic skills to adults, a sometimes underserved group in the world of community programs.   
Feel free to give as little or large as you can, as we get all funds from this campaign, whether we reach our goal of $700 or not.  And please share our campaign!

<h1><b>The Call</b></h1>
<p>Despite the beauty of my life, I have
often asked myself and the Universe what my greater purpose was. Why am I here?
How can I make a difference in this world before I leave it? What can I do to
shine my light? Aren’t these the questions that echo across time lines and
across culture lines? I believe they are the questions that we all ask, at some
point in our life.  I have been called on
that deep search for new meaning and my legacy. </p>
<p>In July of 2013, I received the first step
to answering that question. I have created the space in my life to ride free,
now it is time to dance. In a Shamanic Ceremony, I was blessed with a vision, a
call from the Great Mother. In my vision She asked me to travel the world and
learn women's dances from many different cultures. I am to make a pilgrimage to
find these dances and bring them home into my body, home onto the land, and
then home to other women. </p>
<p>My name is Roxanne Mousseau. I have been a
high school teacher for 10 years as well as a Mentor, Healer, and Guide. When I
was a child I had two very big dreams - to dance and to ride horses. </p>
<p>In the past three years I have learned to
ride (finally) and have gone beyond that to become a certified Equine Assisted
Personal Development Coach. I also have spent the past two years as teaching
riding to youth while working with them to develop skills in leadership and
living their Authentic lives. One of my greatest joys is when one of my clients
(youth or adult) has the Aha! moment and their lives suddenly change because of
what they have discovered inside of themselves. </p>
<p>Riding my beloved horse to me has held
some of the most profound moments of self discovery. She has been one of the
greatest teachers in my life. I have come to a place now where we ride without
tack (no saddles or pads) and only a bitless bridle (nothing in her mouth, just
my reins) because of the feel of our connection when we are body to body. When
we walk, trot, or fly in gallop across the land, I feel free, full, connected,
and one with the Divine. </p>
<p>Dancing has always done the same thing for
me. It brings me back into my body while being focused on that greater
connectedness. Since this call has come, I’ve had the idea that it would be so
powerful to be able to learn dances designed to create connection and play with
them to help myself and others experience greater connectedness to the Great
Spirit (God, Creator, Mother Earth, the Universe…whomever it is that works for
you), to each other, and to our beautiful planet. </p>
<p>Dance takes us to other places inside our
own souls. It allows us to access the spaces within us that have no words. It
allows us to play in those spaces and bring them more fully forward into our
lives. That’s when miracles happen.</p>
<p>I’ve played with this idea a little with
some of the youth that I mentor and have seen tremendous results in seeing them
do things they thought they could not do before after dancing around and moving
their bodies until that old story of “I can’t…” no longer existed in their mind
space or body space. These moments of dancing to let go has literally changed
the lives of my students and has left me in awe of the possibilities to come. I
want more! I want to learn more from around the world and bring it home.</p>
<p>Phase I of Dance the World will see me
step out into the world as a pilgrim. I will first head to Bali followed by
India, West Africa, Australia and New Zealand. In each place I will be seeking
out tribal dances, ancestral dances, and the dance that connects us as humans
to Spirit, to the land, and to each other. By learning each of these, it is my
dream to help myself reconnect to Earth and heal more and then bring that
connection and healing to others. The joy of dance is my legacy and my
contribution to raising the energy and consciousness of our planet. </p>
<p>This is my leap of faith, my quest to
birth something new in my life and new to my world. Through that, to bring an
old idea back to life for others – connection through dance. By helping me shed
the much-loved, but stagnant life I have become comfortable in - you as a
contributor will be helping to change the life of a woman who will bring that
opportunity and space to change to the lives of many others. </p>
<h2><b>The Asking</b></h2>
<p>“Pilgrimage is a powerful metaphor for <i>any</i> journey with the purpose of finding
something that matters to the traveler” (Phil Cousineau in <u>The Art of
Pilgrimage</u>).</p>
<p>The supporting of pilgrims is not only a
gift to that person but a gift to yourself as well. When you provide for a
sacred sojourner  you step into an energy
that brings you to the growth, change, and beauty you are desiring for your own
life. If you’ve always wanted to go in pilgrimage – take that grand adventure
of your life time but you are constrained by responsibilities – this is a way
to get that energy without having to drop your life to do so. There are those
that are called to the path of travel and those that are called to support such
journeys – it has been this way since time immemorial. </p>
<p>In deep gratitude I am seeking to raise
$10,000 for Phase 1 of Dance the World. The money will be used to purchase the
flights necessary to travel to the places I am called to seek dance, to provide
thank you gifts to those people and families that host me as a Pilgrim and
Dancer in the World, and also to provide food and lodging when I stay in places
where I am not offered the hospitality of homes.  In the event that I do not reach my goal, the
money will still be used as described above. </p>

<h2><b>The Impact</b></h2>
<p>“I offered
my support in the form of cash and promotion of the Indiegogo site to a
pilgrim.  She carried my energy with her
on the path and changed my life in the process. 
During the course of her journey to Brigid, the energies of Brigid
entered my life as well and I found myself on the brink of a new venture that
opened my life in ways I had only imagined before.  Having been on walkabout myself 10 years ago,
I can speak from both sides of the process. 
And the energies I received from the support I offered were similar in
strength to those I felt on the journey itself all those years ago.  Supporting a pilgrim is a sacred action.  It comes with sacred rewards.  Step onto your path by helping another step
onto theirs.”  -  <i>Kelle
Sparta, Thought Alchemist/Shaman/Coach, Spiritual Leader University</i></p>
<p>At the very least, your help will change
my life and will fill it with more joy than I already experience. At most, you
will faciliatate the space for change and healing for all the lives of those I
meet and touch throughout my journey and in the coming years as I dance to the
drum of my own heart, of the heart of the Great Mother, our beautiful Earth,
and the rhythm that connects us all as human beings. </p>
<p>Thank you. Thank you for taking the time
to read this, for sharing it, for your contribution in whatever form it takes.

<h2>A little bit about The How</h2>
<p><br/>We are an international ensemble of movers, actors, and musicians from all over the world. We started in 2016 and since have created work all around New York City. The How’s mission is to create a place for audiences and artists to be challenged by a multiplicity of viewpoints, forms, and stories. We believe in upending convention. We believe in creating a sense of place. We believe in taking the emotional temperature of the world and manifesting it in physical form. We’ve performed at The Tank, Irt Theater, Dixon Place, Rubulad, Montgomery Gardens in Brooklyn, and The Unruly Collective in Brooklyn. We love experimenting, we love involving musicians in our work.  We are so honored and humbled to be included in the Emergence residency program at Culture Lab LIC. This winter, they are providing space to a select number of artists across multiple disciplines to develop new work.</p>

<h2><strong>About the project</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>This is a residency to develop a 5 hour movement theater piece exploring the 5 stages of grief and the connection between people. The movement theater piece will be devised and created in rehearsal. What we are curious about is how do all of these emotions live in the body, how are they expressed? The past year has been trying, to say the least. Many of us have lost people, so many of us have been separated from family members, lost jobs, lost heart, lost feeling, and had to adapt. These feelings, this grief, settles in the body and starts to eat away at the soul if it isn’t looked at. This piece is an attempt to release some of this stagnated, heavy energy, and come to a place of catharsis, come to a place of healing through movement. </p>
<p>We are starting the development of the piece with a series of digital rehearsals before moving into Culture Lab’s beautiful gallery space for in-person rehearsals.</p>
<p>The cast: 6 phenomenal movers and musicians based in NYC, working together to devise the piece directed by Polina Ionina.</p>

<p>This is a huge deal for performers who have been unable to work face to face. That’s most of us! The closest we get to that is on Zoom…and I think we’re all pretty tired of creating work on the internet. To say that the team is looking forward to this is an understatement. </p>
<p>While the pandemic has caused a momentous amount of strain on the world at large, it has been no less problematic for artists. Connection and collaboration are key ingredients to working as an artist, as well as the necessity to actually perform live. While virtual communication has been helpful to bridge the gap during this time, it cannot replace the overwhelming necessity of in-person human contact and connection. There is still so much uncertainty as to when the performing arts world can resume regularly without complications. One thing is for certain: art and expression are needed now more than ever in order to make it through these tumultuous times. Since our work is developed largely through improvisation, it is so important for us to have the space to create. Without the cost of rental fees [or outside COVID exposure,] we are able to set the groundwork to later expand and refine for performance when we can perform safely again.</p>

<p>Since this is an in person residency the nature of how we’re accomplishing this is: </p>
<p>We’re asking everyone involved to get tested 72 hours before the date of the in person rehearsals. Everyone must receive a negative test.

<h3>About Culture Lab:</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The Culture Lab LIC realizes just how critical art is right now. They have been instrumental in helping artists during this time of great uncertainty. Starting with the Culture Lab sessions this summer, they turned their parking lot into a live performance venue providing music, comedy, dance, and food. Here people could gather in a safe and socially distanced environment to enjoy the performances and foster community. Now throughout the winter, they have continued to provide these sessions to the public, by live streaming music from the space every week until it is warm enough to resume outdoors again. Having the actual time and space for artistic expression, connection and development is a truly beautiful and cherished thing during this time. </p>

This fall, Interrobang will present the world premiere of <i>Here We Are</i> by Jen Diamond.</p><p><strong>ABOUT THE PLAY</strong><br/>Amelia was the first female pilot to fly around the world. Now, she's dead. When she wakes up in the Underworld, she is forced by Death himself to confront the worst things about her time on Earth in order to forget them once and for all.</p><p><i>Here We Are</i> is a re-framing of Amelia Earhart's history through a feminist, contemporary lens, exploring how the the men in Amelia's life tried their very best to keep Amelia down at every turn just because she was a woman who had big dreams. The story is told from Amelia's perspective and is inspired by real people and events from her life, with a healthy dose of artistic license and magical realism. Central themes exploring the power and destruction of patriarchal fear and Amelia's journey to overcoming that fear are what make the script so incredibly compelling.</p><p><i>Here We Are</i> illustrates how important it is to allow and empower marginalized communities to tell their own stories, and explores what happens when those stories are lost to the narrative of white, male-dominated history and expectations. Amelia Earhart is a timeless symbol of female courage, tenacity, and ingenuity, and it is our hope that our audiences will recognize their own courage through her story of facing off with Death and discovering what it takes to make a place for herself in the world.</p><p><strong>PLAY HISTORY</strong><br/><strong>2014</strong> - Jen Diamond wrote <i>Here We Are</i> while earning her degree at Johns Hopkins University.</p><p><strong>2016</strong> - Interrobang worked with Jen for the first time when she joined the 2016 playwright cohort of our <i>Heavy Hors D'oeuvres</i> short play festival. She wrote a script called <i>Pretty Like Normal</i>, which was given an encore performance at Charm City Fringe's <i>Nights on the Fringe</i> in June 2016. We enjoyed working with Jen so much that we asked her to send us more of her work. She shared <i>Here We Are</i>.</p><p><strong>2017</strong> - Interrobang produced a small reading of <i>Here We Are</i> through <i>Hanging With Interrobang</i>, a monthly reading series featuring new full-length works-in-progress by local playwrights with facilitated feed back sessions to aid the playwright in further developing their work. After hosting this reading, we knew that we wanted to produce <i>Here We Are</i> on a larger scale.

This fall, Interrobang will present the world premiere of Here We Are by Jen Diamond.ABOUT THE PLAYAmelia was the first female pilot to fly around the world. Now, she's dead. When she wakes up in the Underworld, she is forced by Death himself to confront the worst things about her time on Earth in order to forget them once and for all.Here We Are is a re-framing of Amelia Earhart's history through a feminist, contemporary lens, exploring how the the men in Amelia's life tried their very best to keep Amelia down at every turn just because she was a woman who had big dreams. The story is told from Amelia's perspective and is inspired by real people and events from her life, with a healthy dose of artistic license and magical realism. Central themes exploring the power and destruction of patriarchal fear and Amelia's journey to overcoming that fear are what make the script so incredibly compelling.Here We Are illustrates how important it is to allow and empower marginalized communities to tell their own stories, and explores what happens when those stories are lost to the narrative of white, male-dominated history and expectations. Amelia Earhart is a timeless symbol of female courage, tenacity, and ingenuity, and it is our hope that our audiences will recognize their own courage through her story of facing off with Death and discovering what it takes to make a place for herself in the world.PLAY HISTORY2014 - Jen Diamond wrote Here We Are while earning her degree at Johns Hopkins University.2016 - Interrobang worked with Jen for the first time when she joined the 2016 playwright cohort of our Heavy Hors D'oeuvres short play festival. She wrote a script called Pretty Like Normal, which was given an encore performance at Charm City Fringe's Nights on the Fringe in June 2016. We enjoyed working with Jen so much that we asked her to send us more of her work. She shared Here We Are.2017 - Interrobang produced a small reading of Here We Are through Hanging With Interrobang, a monthly reading series featuring new full-length works-in-progress by local playwrights with facilitated feed back sessions to aid the playwright in further developing their work. After hosting this reading, we knew that we wanted to produce Here We Are on a larger scale. The script had comedy, drama, poetry, urgency, and, at its core, a strong female character working to find her own voice to tell her own story. 2019 - Throughout the summer of 2019, we worked with Jen to develop and hone Here We Are. In August 2019, we presented a new draft of the script to a full house at the Kennedy Center's 18th Annual Page to Stage New Play Festival. After receiving feedback there, Jen will provide one more draft before we head into rehearsals on September 30, 2019.

<h3>Qui suis-je ? </h3>
<p>Évoluant en tant qu’interprète et chorégraphe en danse contemporaine depuis quatre ans, j’ai eu la chance de danser pour des chorégraphes aussi prestigieux et diversifiés que <strong>Ginette Laurin</strong> (O Vertigo), <strong>Ismael Mouaraki </strong>(Destins Croisés) ou encore <strong>Dana Gingras</strong> (Animals of Distinction / The Holly Body Tattoo). Ce parcours m’a aussi mené sur plusieurs scènes internationales, et à chaque fois, le bonheur de faire partie de ceux qui participent au rayonnement de notre culture n’en n’était que plus grand ! Mais cette fois-ci, pour la toute 1<sup>ère</sup> fois, c’est mon œuvre <strong>en tant que chorégraphe; [ID] DOUBLE, qui s’exporte au plan international - et j'en suis très fier !! :) </strong><br/> </p>

Ce n’est pas tant sa prodigieuse carrière qui retint mon attention, mais plutôt sa personnalité complexe et troublante. Au-delà de sa force et de son assurance, un combat acharné se jouait en secret, qu’elle perdit d’ailleurs. C’est alors que l’idée d’une nouvelle œuvre naquit en moi : </span><strong style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;letter-spacing: 0px;'>[ID] DOUBLE</strong><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: normal;letter-spacing: 0px;'>. </span></p>
<p>Je créais un solo,  avec le profond désir de témoigner avec précision, force et humanisme, de la lutte qu’elle mena, s’évertuant à la fois à dissimuler sa vraie personnalité tout en se dévoiler en tant qu’artiste. Même si la Callas servait de trame de fond, je compris rapidement que toute artiste pouvait être confrontée au même problème, et qu’<strong>[ID] DOUBLE </strong>serait un thème universel. Et c’est exactement là que nous nous rendîmes : au bord du vide, entre chute et ascension - où le corps féminin porteur de cette gestuelle organique, fort et doux à la fois, allait se mouvoir avec fluidité dans l'espace et faire preuve d'une maîtrise assumée dans sa dualité exacerbée.</p>

<p>En 2015, lorsque la 1<sup>ère</sup> représentation de ma pièce [ID] DOUBLE, eut lieu à la Maison de la Culture Maisonneuve de Montréal, je fus réellement ravi et touché de la confiance que l’on me démontrait, mais surtout de pouvoir présenter mon travail chorégraphique. Plusieurs autres dates * se rajoutèrent dans différentes Maisons de la Culture, et plus récemment le prestigieux FIFA, Festival International du Film sur l’Art décidait de programmer la version court-métrage de 8 min. d’[ID] DOUBLE à son édition 2016 – tout un honneur !

<p>Votre contribution servira directement au financement du projet, c'est à dire cela permettra de compléter les dépenses suivantes : </p>

<p>Ce projet de présenter [ID] DOUBLE en France est un aboutissement exceptionnel qui marquera un tournant décisif dans ma carrière de chorégraphe. Tout d’abord, il y a cette rencontre avec un tout nouveau public qui m’est donnée de pouvoir vivre. La possibilité pour un chorégraphe d’offrir son travail à un regard neuf et étranger est un  accomplissement résolument enrichissant, car il remet aussi en question certains acquis, et confronte l’artiste à une probable insécurité. Ensuite, il y a l’impact direct et majeur qu’une tournée en France peut entraîner sans son sillage, c'est à dire interpeller d'autres diffuseurs au niveau international, et envisager d'autres représentations à l'étranger ! :) </p>
<p>Votre contribution est donc essentielle à ce stade-ci, elle me permettra de compléter le budget nécessaire à la réalisation du projet, en plus de contribuer à l’exportation et au rayonnement de la culture québécoise au niveau international, la tournée [ID] DOUBLE en France ne peut être que bénéfique en termes de retombées nationales et internationales. Ces bénéfices auront un impact direct autant sur mon travail chorégraphique que sur l’avenir et le développement de ma carrière, entraînant dans mon sillage plusieurs autres artistes avec lesquels je collabore. </p>

<h3>Why This Story?</h3>
<p>We are all struggling to be seen, to be heard. In this adaptation he writer has chosen to focus on opening up the mind of someone who is struggling with serious mental illness (specifically anxiety and depression) and create a landscape in order for those on the outside to see what is actually going on. Our goal is to tell an honest story of trying to survive patriarchal systems of oppression and give voice to and validation to the mental health struggles that come with that.</p>

<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>Art is work and it is our goal to be able to pay our artists what they are worth. Our production is low-key as far as physical design elements, but we still would love support to make this all it can be. With your help we will be able to :</p>
<ul>
<li>Pay actor and designer stipends</li>
<li>Pay off the space right away</li>
<li>Charge less for tickets to make our production more accessible</li>
</ul>
<p>Our goal is accessibility and inclusion and that doesn't stop at casting; we want our audiences to feel welcome and excited to hear these stories for the first time. </p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

<li>You can support us monthly on <a href=""https://www.patreon.com/stagerageportland"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Patreon</strong></a>!</li>
<li>Spread the word! Word of mouth is more powerful than any other media.</li>
<li>Share, share, share! Social media is the second most powerful way to hear about events like this.</li>

<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p><strong>​​Stage Rage</strong> was originally conceptualized by Megan Tripaldi and Beth Somerville in Portland, ME in 2014 with the creepiest production of King Lear (at least that we had seen).<br/>From there we have been generating projects that create original concepts for established work or creating and supporting new and exciting work from local artists based on myths, legends, and stories that have been around for centuries.<br/>​We want to continue asking why we return to classical works. Why do we keep telling these stories? How can we make them more relevant?</p>

Art is work and it is our goal to be able to pay our artists what they are worth. Our production is low-key as far as physical design elements, but we still would love support to make this all it can be. With your help we will be able to :

Pay actor and designer stipends
Pay off the space right away
Charge less for tickets to make our production more accessible

Our goal is accessibility and inclusion and that doesn't stop at casting; we want our audiences to feel welcome and excited to hear these stories for the first time. 
Other Ways You Can Help

You can support us monthly on Patreon!
Spread the word! Word of mouth is more powerful than any other media.
Share, share, share! Social media is the second most powerful way to hear about events like this.
Come see the show. After all, we couldn't have done it without you. :)


Who We Are
​​Stage Rage was originally conceptualized by Megan Tripaldi and Beth Somerville in Portland, ME in 2014 with the creepiest production of King Lear (at least that we had seen).From there we have been generating projects that create original concepts for established work or creating and supporting new and exciting work from local artists based on myths, legends, and stories that have been around for centuries.​We want to continue asking why we return to classical works. Why do we keep telling these stories? How can we make them more relevant?",0.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<h3>Chapitres de la chute - Saga des Lehman Brothers - </h3>
<p><u><strong>R É S U M É   D E   L A   P I È C E :</strong></u></p>
<p>Septembre 1884, un jeune Juif de Bavière, Heyum Lehmann, débarque en Amérique comme des milliers d’autres avec lui. Les douaniers d’Ellis Island se chargent rapidement de le rebaptiser Henry et l’homme file vers l’Alabama. Parti d’absolument rien, il monte avec ses deux frères un petit magasin de tissu appelé à devenir le premier endroit de négociation de coton du pays.</p>
<p>Septembre 2008, minée par les «subprimes», emprunts pourris qu’elle a créés et vendus sans ménagement aux classes moyennes américaines, la Banque d’investissement Lehman Brothers, quatrième des Etats-Unis, s’écroule avec violence. L’entreprise qui avait pourtant survécu aux plus violentes bourrasques des deux siècles précédents (Guerre de Sécession et crise de 29) entraîne le monde entier dans sa chute. Cet immense empire financier patiemment élevé par la famille Lehman révèle ce en quoi il s’est transformé : un golem immatériel, cupide et insatiable. Mais en-a-t-il toujours été ainsi ?</p>
<p>Septembre 2018, Portrait-Robot présente au Périscope cette extraordinaire épopée. Une pièce monumentale en trois parties, qui se développe sur plusieurs générations en mettant en scène près de deux siècles de capitalisme américain. Des champs de coton du Sud au New York du tournant du siècle, de l’abolition de l’esclavagisme à l’apparition de la télévision, de la seconde guerre mondiale à la folie des marchés boursiers, de la sobre naissance à la spectaculaire chute finale.</p>
<p><u><strong>P O R T R A I T - R O B O T</strong></u></p>
<p>Portrait-Robot est une jeune compagnie artistique de la ville de Québec.</p>
<p><u><strong>Voici notre historique et notre mandat :</strong></u></p>
<p>Portrait-Robot pour la recherche de la vérité. Parce que le théâtre est souvent un casse-tête. Parce qu’il y a des essais et des erreurs. Parce que l’on doit être patient, intelligent, vif d’esprit, attentif aux moindres détails. Parce que tout est toujours en mouvement, en cavale. Parce qu’au départ, tout cela n’était qu’un jeu. Parce que l’on s’y fait rencontrer les disciplines artistiques. Parce que le théâtre peut être artisanal. (portrait) Parce qu’il peut aussi être technologique. (robot) Parce qu’il peut être une conjugaison des deux. Parce que c’est un devoir de mémoire. Parce que sans portrait, le Robot n’a pas d’émotion.</p>
<p><i>Femme Non-Rééducable / Anna P</i>., présenté en mars 2014 à Premier Acte fut le premier projet. Fort d’un succès critique et public (salles combles tout au long des 3 semaines de représentation), nous avons ensuite envie de nous attaquer à une création brute. Cependant, dans un désir de conserver l’aspect « documentaire » sous-jacent à notre mandat, nous aborderons les thématiques communes à la fin de la vie de Van Gogh et au printemps érable de 2012. Le tout, relié par la vie d’un homme en perte de repères qui rencontrent les acteurs reliés à ces deux événements. Et, avec cette histoire, transformer l’information en poésie et créer <i>Architecture du printemps</i>, solo qui fût présenté à Premier Acte en mars 2016.</p>
<p>Fort de ces deux spectacles, Chapitres de la chute - Saga des Lehman Brothers - est la nouvelle aventure artistique. Le troisième Portrait-Robot.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>À QUOI SERVIRONS VOS CONTRIBUTIONS ?</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Avec cette campagne de socio-financement, notre objectif est concrètement d'amasser plus de sous afin de payer encore plus convenablement les artistes impliqués au sein du projet.  <i>Chapitres de la chute</i> est un spectacle de plus de 4h30 et exige, évidemment, une grande implication physique, émotive et intellectuelle de la part de tous les artisans du spectacle.  </p>
<p>À l'image de la famille Lehman, nous nous sommes investis dans ce projet sans compter les heures.  Nous croyons fermement en notre projet et sommes persuadés de sa grande pertinence dans l'écologie de la vie théâtrale de Québec.  Nous sommes aussi certains du goût de l'audace qui habite la population de la Ville de Québec.</p>
<p>Contribuer à notre campagne, c'est encourager l'énergie créatrice, confirmer notre croyance en ce projet, collaborer à ce que des projets du genre puissent voir le jour à Québec et réussir à payer de façon un peu plus convenable les humains investis dans cette épopée théâtrale.</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>L'IMPACT</h3>
<p>Le monde financier apparaît fréquemment, aux communs des mortels, comme un casse-tête impossible à comprendre dans son entièreté. Nous vivons dans une époque où l’économie est fragile et le taux d’endettement très élevé ; près de 160 % au Québec. Lors des deux dernières années (2016-2017), c’est environ 40 000 consommateurs ou entreprises qui ont déclaré faillite ou soumis une entente de paiements à leurs créanciers. Des records. </p>
<p><br/>Il est inutile alors de préciser que, pour la majorité des gens, le visage de la finance et de ses dirigeants n’est pas reluisant. Il représente l’ennemi, le rapace, le riche qui se plaît à creuser l’écart entre les classes sociales. </p>
<p><br/>Sans croire que la pensée populaire bifurquera entièrement, nous considérons que ce spectacle offre des pistes de réflexions et de nouvelles visions sur ce monde complexe et difficile à défricher. En 2008, la faillite de la banque d’investissement Lehman Brothers est devenue le symbole de la crise de tout un système. Un système qui avait fini par échapper à ses créateurs, de même qu'il échappe encore aujourd'hui à la compréhension des non-initiés. Avec cette pièce, chaque spectateur mènera sa propre réflexion grâce aux indices, préfigurations et pressentiments de la chute qui jalonnent la pièce. </p>
<p><br/><strong>La force théâtrale et politique de Chapitres de la chute est de remettre l'humain au cœur de l'élaboration d'un système qui, aujourd'hui, nous apparaît dépourvu de visage humain. </strong></p>
<p>Voici quelques extraits de critiques du spectacle, ils démontrent, selon nous, la grande pertinence du projet : </p>
<p>""Franchement, le Théâtre Périscope démarre sa nouvelle saison en force avec cette pièce qui fait plus que jamais écho à notre société.""</p>
<p>Ici Radio-Canada</p>
<p>""La proposition est on ne peut plus costaude — plus de 4h30 de représentation, 150 ans d’histoire à traverser — mais les personnages et les épisodes sont si bien amenés qu’on regarde la saga des Lehman Brothers avec autant d’appétit qu’une série addictive sur Netflix. »</p>
<p>Revue Jeu</p>
<p>« Le théâtre de la rue Crémazie ne fait pas les choses à moitié en ouvrant sa saison avec Chapitres de la chute, une costaude, ambitieuse et solide proposition  (…) on ne peut que lever notre chapeau aux comédiens qui portent ce spectacle ambitieux sans jamais lui laisser perdre son souffle. »</p>

<h3>PRENDRE DES RISQUES </h3>
<p>Nous avons pris un risque en choisissant cette oeuvre théâtrale.</p>

<p>Nous croyons fermement en la pertinence de cette pièce mais sommes bien conscients que, même avec un appui financer de diverses formes de subventions, le salaire de chacun des gens impliqués au sein du projet ne sera pas à la hauteur de leur investissement.</p>

You want to shake your big hips as you are in control of everything and everyone around you. You want to possess and be possessed without seeming a little bit too slutty or whore like. You are in control of your own body and your fantasies, as you energetically type those words onto your friend’s type writer “I’m into you. Please be mine”.

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Theatre is a place full of risk. As experimental creators we are at risk of being misunderstood, not understood or simply hated. But that's the risk that we are willing to take as theatre makers. Our shows always divide audiences and now after couple of years of being in this industry, we realise that this can work in our favour.</p>
<p>We are at a big venue so our biggest challenge will be to fill the auditorium with plenty of people. However with the right marketing strategy and the support we have already started gathering from creating feminist work, we are positive about our potential audiences.</p>

<p>Help PlayGround Publications publish
this year’s anthology of the season’s best scripts by pre-ordering a copy of
<i>The Best of PlayGround-Los Angeles (2015)</i></p>
<p><b> THE BACKSTORY</b></p>
<p>Since 1994, the mission of PlayGround
has been to support the development of new voices for the theatre. For over two
decades, PlayGround has been a leading playwright incubator, providing unique
opportunities for the cultivation and development of early-career local
playwrights and partnerships with leading professional directors, actors,
theatres and theatre lovers. In 2012, PlayGround expanded to Los Angeles with
the launch of PlayGround-LA and its inaugural season in residence at the Zephyr
Theatre.</p>
<p>Through the development of original
short (and eventually full-length) plays, PlayGround-LA creates a microcosm of
the greater theatre scene, supporting emerging playwrights' experimentation and
risk-taking, while helping them hone their style and technique.</p>
<p><b> PUBLISH OR PERISH</b></p>
<p>For the past fourteen years,
PlayGround Publications has promoted the work of scores of emerging new
playwrights and their short plays through the <i>Best of PlayGround</i> series of
anthologies.</p>
<p>In mid-May, PlayGround Publications
will print two new <i>Best of PlayGround 2015 </i>anthologies. You can help us in this
mission by pre-ordering copies of the Los Angeles book through this Indiegogo
funding campaign.</p>
<p>The book contains six scripts as
performed at this year’s Best of PlayGround Gala new plays showcase (May 11,
2015). These six plays were selected as the best this season from more than 100
submissions and thirty-six works developed through the Monday Night PlayGround
staged reading series.</p>
<p>Each script is printed in its
entirety, creating an historical record of the development of these plays, with
dates of first reading and premiere, original casting information and
playwright biographies.</p>
<p>Proceeds of this funding campaign
will be used exclusively to print and distribute the <i>Best of PlayGround-Los
Angeles</i> anthology.</p>
<p>The <i>Best of PlayGround</i> anthologies:</p>
<p></p><ul>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Celebrate the best short plays of the
past season;</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Provide an economical way to bring

The Best of PlayGround-Los Angeles (2015)
 THE BACKSTORY
Since 1994, the mission of PlayGround
has been to support the development of new voices for the theatre. For over two
decades, PlayGround has been a leading playwright incubator, providing unique
opportunities for the cultivation and development of early-career local
playwrights and partnerships with leading professional directors, actors,
theatres and theatre lovers. In 2012, PlayGround expanded to Los Angeles with
the launch of PlayGround-LA and its inaugural season in residence at the Zephyr
Theatre.
Through the development of original
short (and eventually full-length) plays, PlayGround-LA creates a microcosm of
the greater theatre scene, supporting emerging playwrights' experimentation and
risk-taking, while helping them hone their style and technique.
 PUBLISH OR PERISH
For the past fourteen years,
PlayGround Publications has promoted the work of scores of emerging new
playwrights and their short plays through the Best of PlayGround series of
anthologies.
In mid-May, PlayGround Publications
will print two new Best of PlayGround 2015 anthologies. You can help us in this
mission by pre-ordering copies of the Los Angeles book through this Indiegogo
funding campaign.
The book contains six scripts as
performed at this year’s Best of PlayGround Gala new plays showcase (May 11,
2015). These six plays were selected as the best this season from more than 100
submissions and thirty-six works developed through the Monday Night PlayGround
staged reading series.
Each script is printed in its
entirety, creating an historical record of the development of these plays, with
dates of first reading and premiere, original casting information and
playwright biographies.
Proceeds of this funding campaign
will be used exclusively to print and distribute the Best of PlayGround-Los
Angeles anthology.
The Best of PlayGround anthologies:


Celebrate the best short plays of the
past season;


Provide an economical way to bring
high-quality audience-tested scripts to the attention of producers and
educators;


Promote the work of new generations
of talented playwrights;


Provide students and new dramatists
with models of plays that have proven popular with audiences;


Creates an historical record of the
development of these plays.


This year PlayGround is expanding the
role of these books to help move the work of its talented emerging writers from
page and into production.

<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;"">Hi, <span>
<br/>
</span>I’m Martina Marini, a dancer and choreographer living and working in Italy/Southtirol. I’m the Director of the MartinaMariniDanceTheatre who wants to give professional dancers, which live abroad due to lack of job opportunities, the possibility, to do high quality work in Italy.</p>
<br/>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;"">With my creative work I want to express my visions, ideas and thoughts, but above all, I want to tell a story. The expressive language I therefore use, is movement not only in it's form, but especially in it's intention. For the company, the most important thing is the content; dance is a mix of theatrical elements and everything is composed in a very experimental way. For the new project “Gender Play” I decided to work with two young and very motivated dancers, Anastasia and David.</p>
<br/>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;"">The new project is a piece about gender identity, which plays with typical male or female movements or what the society perceives as. The dancers started from the question what a typical male or female movement could be, observing people on the street, discussing about the reasons. Do the difference depends on hormons, physics or education? Experimenting with our observations, playing with clichés and changing roles, we come up with interesting interpretations. During the working process which is based on movement research the dancers are developing their own material which is surrounded by gender topic and includes personal experiences but also stereotypes. The issue is treated in an ironic way, without neglecting the dramatic aspect of all the people, which are born in a wrong body.</p>
<br/>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;"">We won an initiative, that allows us to take part in a big dance festival in Italy (Oriente Occidente 2015, 18th september 2015) where emerging companies can show their work, and we are very excited and grateful for this fantastic opportunitiy. What we do need from you in order to complete our choreography and to make the performance happen, is your support. We kindly ask for your help to cover the production costs for dancers, choreography, light design, costumes and video.</p>Our time and passion flows to our dancing and with you as a partner we would be able to cover the financial gap! Any help you could provide is highly appreciated and we  would be deeply grateful for any support from your side. <p></p>

I’m Martina Marini, a dancer and choreographer living and working in Italy/Southtirol. I’m the Director of the MartinaMariniDanceTheatre who wants to give professional dancers, which live abroad due to lack of job opportunities, the possibility, to do high quality work in Italy.

With my creative work I want to express my visions, ideas and thoughts, but above all, I want to tell a story. The expressive language I therefore use, is movement not only in it's form, but especially in it's intention. For the company, the most important thing is the content; dance is a mix of theatrical elements and everything is composed in a very experimental way. For the new project “Gender Play” I decided to work with two young and very motivated dancers, Anastasia and David.

The new project is a piece about gender identity, which plays with typical male or female movements or what the society perceives as. The dancers started from the question what a typical male or female movement could be, observing people on the street, discussing about the reasons. Do the difference depends on hormons, physics or education? Experimenting with our observations, playing with clichés and changing roles, we come up with interesting interpretations. During the working process which is based on movement research the dancers are developing their own material which is surrounded by gender topic and includes personal experiences but also stereotypes. The issue is treated in an ironic way, without neglecting the dramatic aspect of all the people, which are born in a wrong body.

We won an initiative, that allows us to take part in a big dance festival in Italy (Oriente Occidente 2015, 18th september 2015) where emerging companies can show their work, and we are very excited and grateful for this fantastic opportunitiy. What we do need from you in order to complete our choreography and to make the performance happen, is your support. We kindly ask for your help to cover the production costs for dancers, choreography, light design, costumes and video.Our time and passion flows to our dancing and with you as a partner we would be able to cover the financial gap! Any help you could provide is highly appreciated and we  would be deeply grateful for any support from your side. 

Thank you very much!
