The last track I released was 4 years ago back in 2012. Since then I still get people emailing and messaging me almost every day asking when there will be new music. I put AC130 on hold so I could focus on my full band (Burn It To The Ground) but I feel that the time is right to give you guys what you want. For the past few months I've been planning and working on a full length AC130 album. I had originally planned to record and mix everything myself with all of my old gear just like I usually did back in the day. But I think you guys deserve better than that and I want to make this album sound better than anything I've released previously. In order to do that I'm going to need your help. I'm going to be putting all my effort into making this album sound incredible for you. In the album reveal video above you can hear a demo clip of a song that will be on the album. At the bottom of the page you can check out some of my old songs. I hope the teaser clip gets you guys excited for the full album!</div><div><br/></div><div>
<h3>What Your Funding Will Be Used For</h3>
<div>As I stated before, I want this album to sound as good as it possibly can. In order to do that I'm going to need access to better gear than I have now. I don't want to skimp out on any aspect. If I end up exceeding my funding goal I'd also like to get some guests on the album as well as a few other extras. Every cent of funding will be used to make this album sound as perfect as it can possibly be. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<h3>How you can help</h3>If you don't have the cash to pre order and still want help out, you can share this on facebook, twitter, instagram, or any other social media outlet. Every share counts and will help me get closer to reaching my goal. I can't do this without you guys and anything you can do to help out would be greatly appreciated. </div>

Since then I still get people emailing and messaging me almost every day asking when there will be new music. I put AC130 on hold so I could focus on my full band (Burn It To The Ground) but I feel that the time is right to give you guys what you want. For the past few months I've been planning and working on a full length AC130 album. I had originally planned to record and mix everything myself with all of my old gear just like I usually did back in the day. But I think you guys deserve better than that and I want to make this album sound better than anything I've released previously. In order to do that I'm going to need your help. I'm going to be putting all my effort into making this album sound incredible for you. In the album reveal video above you can hear a demo clip of a song that will be on the album. At the bottom of the page you can check out some of my old songs. I hope the teaser clip gets you guys excited for the full album!
What Your Funding Will Be Used For
As I stated before, I want this album to sound as good as it possibly can. In order to do that I'm going to need access to better gear than I have now. I don't want to skimp out on any aspect. If I end up exceeding my funding goal I'd also like to get some guests on the album as well as a few other extras. Every cent of funding will be used to make this album sound as perfect as it can possibly be. 


How you can helpIf you don't have the cash to pre order and still want help out, you can share this on facebook, twitter, instagram, or any other social media outlet. Every share counts and will help me get closer to reaching my goal. I can't do this without you guys and anything you can do to help out would be greatly appreciated. 


Regarding Shirt Sizes
If you purchase one of the shirt packages please be sure to message me directly with what size of shirt you need.

<p><strong>Who Are We?</strong></p>
<p>We are <strong>Duo van Vliet</strong>, and we take our name from Don van Vliet, more commonly known by his avant-garde rock persona <strong>Captain Beefheart</strong>. We aim to preserve and honour his love of experimentation and genre-mashing.</p>
<p>More specifically, we are<strong> Ian Anderson </strong>(Scottish viola) and <strong>Rafał Łuc</strong> (Polish accordion). We met while studying at the Royal Academy of Music, London, forming Duo van Vliet in 2011. Our love of interesting programming and contemporary music brought us together as a duo, and is the driving force behind this album: we want to present interesting, themed music from across the centuries together, from the very old to the very new. (Short individual biographies at bottom of page.)</p>
<p><strong>How Can You Help Us?</strong></p>
<p>We are asking for you to contribute to an incredibly important moment in our development as a duo: the release and launch of our first studio album. Being able to release it will have a massive impact on our future ability to attract audience, receive invitations to perform at festivals, and to commission composers to write for us.</p>
<p>We have recorded all the tracks, had photos taken for the artwork by photographer Bartek Sadowski (Vladimir Ashkenazy, Lukas Podolski), and found a fantastic label in <strong>Orchid Classics</strong> (Brodsky Quartet, Jennifer Stumm). We now need to raise £1500 to cover production costs of the album (both physical and digital), the PR campaign (including getting reviews placed in national publications), and the album launch recital in London.</p>
<p><i>Any money raised over our £1500 target will go towards commissioning composers in the future.</i></p>
<p><strong>Listen to 3 of the tracks on our Soundcloud page:</strong> <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/duovanvliet"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://soundcloud.com/duovanvliet</a></p>
<p>The album is based around Britten’s <i>Lachrymae</i>, which in turn is based on the two Dowland songs on our album: <i>If My Complaints Should Passions Move </i>and<i> Flow My Tears</i>. This theme of tears is then extended through Rory Boyle’s <i>Such Sweet Sorrow</i> for viola solo, while the other tracks on the album by Adam Porebski, Gavin Higgins and Toshio Hosokawa were then chosen to compliment and add shape to the disk. (Full track listing at bottom of page.)</p>
<p><strong>Is That It?</strong></p>
<p>No! This album is just the beginning: working with Orchid Classics will raise our profile and allow us to reach more of an audience, in turn allowing us more recitals. We will then build our profile and funds so we are able to commission more and more composers to write new and fascinating works for us. We have many bold plans for the future, and we need your help to take the first steps.</p>

I'm not a millionaire and can't pay for promotion, so please, support it, I know you can, because it doesn't require much to do that but it's very helpful.<br/><b><br/>HELLo!</b><br/><br/>Let me introduce myself. My name is Anton and I live and breathe music since I could remember myself. Thanks to my Dad for bringing Deep Purple into my life. And then the story began. Now I listen to many bands of various genres from jazz to death metal, collect CDs, go to concerts. And now my Dad discovers the new bands to him with my help. He's 53 and it's great to see him listening to black metal. So a few weeks ago I came up with an idea: why won't we gather on some day, no matter what age, to show unity of people, for whom rock, metal, punk music and other sub-genres mean more than just a fashion or pop culture. <br/>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>The idea is simple:</b></p>

<p>You pull an ANTIPOP DAY t-shirt, go out in your city (bar, club, concert, etc), meet each other (t-shirt will help it), talk about music, future plans, recollect the past, drink beer or just enjoy the summer Saturday evening. <br/></p>

""Break It Down Boston"" at MIT on April 16th, and one we will record and include on 
our CD.</p>
<h3>Thank you for choosing to support X.ado in our CD Recording and Giving project!</h3>
<p></p>
<p>X.ado's purpose and mission is ""To Sing For Christ"", and we make 
lasting memories by singing for various audiences around then 
world--sharing Christ's love through song. But what if we could leave 
something more substantial with every audience, so that they could 
continue to be inspired and encouraged even after we're done performing?
 This is our vision in recording a CD. We want to be able to keep the 
hope of Christ ringing in the ears of our audiences, as well as give 
them a special physical gift to share with others.</p>
<p>Every 
dollar of this donation will go towards the project: $500 for further 
recording, $1,000 for mixing/finalizing, and $1,000 for raw material.<br/></p>
<p>We realize this is an 
ambitious amount to ask from our already extremely generous supporters. 
However, this project is of utmost importance in our mission as an a 
cappella group. Many groups on campus record albums, and we as members 
of the body of Christ are especially responsible for spreading His love 
continuously through a more permanent embodiment of our music.</p>

<p><b>&gt; about TEMPLE TREE</b></p>
<p>TEMPLE TREE is an offering, a prayer, a collection of songs that my antennas picked up from the great spirit radio, that got in tune with inspiration from all the guest musician friends.</p>
<p>All the 21 songs in this double album are prayers. To love, to nature, to the elements, the divine, the force, to gods and goddesses, healing sounds for the future generations. Some are very old mantras that got to me in a particular vibration.</p>
<p>It is being recorded since spring 2015 in rishikesh (in), pushkar (in), barcelona (cat), london (uk), santa cruz (ca, usa), porto (pt) &amp; aljezur (pt). Most of it is already done. There are songs in portuguese, spanish, english, sanscrit, punjabi and some words in other languages (hindi, lakota, wirarika, kichua, mapuche…).</p>
<p>Now is the time for the MIXING, the MASTERING and the PRINTING of TEMPLE TREE to take place. This CROWD FUND has been set up with the intention of collecting SUPPORT to help pay for the final stages of this independent production. The goal is to have the work ready and printed to send under the crescent moon of July, in this year 2016. TEMPLE TREE will be made out of 2 CDs: TEMPLE and TREE.</p>
<p>In this new moon of April, a renowned moon for planting healthy seeds,I open this call for support to this sung prayer in the form of a music double album, so it can spread its vibration into the 4 corners of this land in these times of turbulence and transformation. </p>
<p>I plant this TEMPLE TREE seed in the sacred ground calling in for your support, </p>
<p>&amp; the permission of the sacred fire &amp; the 7 directions.</p>
<p>Blessed be (y)our way,</p>
<p>Grateful,</p>
<p>m*</p>

<p><b>&gt; about music + me + TEMPLE TREE</b></p>
<p>My name is Mariana, I was born in Portugal and I've been singing since before I started talking. As there is a musical predisposition in my blood family I also studied music when I was young.</p>
<p>Through my life I've discovered and explored singing as my main way of offering and connecting to the divine force. I've been listening and singing in different sacred circles, from tipis to malocas, from vision quest to sat sang halls, around the world for a while.</p>
<p>In different circumstances, after listening to me live, people have come up to me and asked how could they listen to my songs again, and that was the reason why I decided to record a first album, “Roda dos Ventos”. After 3 years of more singing and new songs that is also on of the main reasons that makes me want to release this second one, TEMPLE TREE, into the wild ;)</p>
<p>As my heart family is around different places of this planet, the Internet is a good vehicle to spread the word and the news about this TEMPLE TREE.</p>
<p>And with a “little help from my friends” as the Beatles say, it makes it more magical and easier to manifest.</p>

> sobre musica + yo + TEMPLE TREE
Me llamo Mariana e nasci en Portugal e creo que empece a cantar antes de hablar. 
Hay una tendência musical em mi família e estudei musica de pequeña. Durante la vida fui descobriendo y explorando cantar como la manera principal de me conectar a la fuerza divina. Hace tiempo que  al rededor del planeta escucho e canto en distintos circulos sagrados. De tipis a malocas, de temascales de busca de vision a salones e sat sangs.
Em distintas circunstancias depuse de haver escuchado cantar la gente me preguntava como tener acesso a mis cantos e de ai salió el “roda dos ventos” em 2013, ahora 3 años después de cantar e de muchos cantos nuevos esta sigue siendo una de las razones para soltar TEMPLE TREE así al universo.
Como la familia de corazón está por distintas partes de est@ planeta, el internet es um buen medio para lanzar el llamado y compartir las noticias de TEMPLE TREE.  E com el apoyo de la comunidade se torna mas magico e mas fácil de manifestar.

I own a little indie studio called Featherhead Media, and the <strong>Change My Mind</strong> full-length CD and book are the first out in a series of inspirational materials that are planned. <a href=""http://www.featherheadmedia.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.featherheadmedia.com/</a></p><p>The idea behind<strong> Change My Mind: </strong>you can listen to it just to be entertained - the songs are beautifully positive and flowing- but there is a deep message in the album for those who want to receive it. And this is the message:</p><p><strong><i>“Although there are many things that are important in life, perhaps one of the most important is knowing that you are unconditionally loved by someone. When you know that your worth comes from being loved and not by what you do, you are secure and happy.”</i></strong></p><p>So, get that love, whatever it takes, no matter what. It is there and it’s available to you. This album shows a way to listen to your heart and come home to unconditional love.The 12 songs take you on a journey from a person who protests the status quo that causes stress and starts listening to her hungry heart to a place where she finally rests in an unconditional love from above. </p><h3>Change My Mind will encourage you in these ways:</h3><p>- By helping you dust off your talents and get them going - no matter how young or old you are. If I can do it, you can do it too! </p><p>- By hitting you with some powerful lyrics that will lift your eyes up out of your situation and help you focus on the solution</p><p>- By pointing the way to an unconditional love that is available to us all, every one. This will have a tremendous impact on everything you think or do in a positive way.</p><p>And by giving you positive and dance-friendly original music from my heart to yours.</p><h3>About the Change My Mind Album:</h3><p>Change My Mind will take you on a journey from a stressful life to one based on unconditional love. You will find a “smorgasbord”, (Swedish word for a table full of all sorts of great dishes) of country, pop, rock, and gospel, and ballads on this album - all with a flow that soothes the soul. We will release the album digitally during 2017. If we reach our goal, we will print physical CD:s as well.</p><p><strong>About the Change My Mind Book</strong></p><p>The book will give some practical tips on how to deal with stress, on how to listen to your inner man and how to take steps to see yourself through the eyes of unconditional love. The idea is to create an e-book but, if we raise enough funds we will print physical copies.</p><p><strong>About the Change My Mind Music Videos:</strong></p><p>I am almost completely done with three music videos from the Change My Mind CD, (to get see these videos before they go public is an important part of the perks). The music videos are to the songs Just How Good (Psalm 23) filmed in a sheep pasture; Don’t Worry (John 14) filmed by a lake and Come to Me (Mathew 11)filmed by the ocean.</p><p><strong>About me: </strong></p><p>             <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1476450005/wq0zv25to2mlkloaqjnu.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Born in New York, living in Southern Sweden, I started songwriting when I was ten and toured with a band in the greater New York area in my teens, singing and playing guitar, flute and banjo. I was in an elite choir in high school and was offered a Scholarship at a music college when my dad put his foot down and said I should do something else - anything else, that would “bring in the money”. So, I gave up and chose another path than music and lost faith in my musical abilities for years. But I kept on singing and songwriting….. Back then you couldn't record your own album the way you can today - but the new technologies available today have made Change My Mind possible.</p><p>I am the songwriter, producer, singer, multi-musician and the ""glue"" for this CD. But without the “band” I could never have gotten this done.</p><h3><strong>About the “Band”:</strong></h3><p>We aren’t really a band, but a project made up of 10 musicians/soloists from three different countries. Because of their expertise, Change My Mind is evolving into a beautiful patchwork of different genres with a professional sound.</p><p><strong>Per G Imsen</strong> - a humble man, gifted pianist and audio engineer who is not only a great musician but a great friend. <strong>Albin Ekman</strong> - probably the best fiddle player in Sweden and he is VERY tall - over 2 metres! <strong>Johan Malmberg</strong> - banjo, member of the Original Five, an amazing bluegrass band from Malmoe. <strong>Jesper Nordberg:</strong> A mere 19 yrs. old and already a PRO at the bass, Jesper is addicted to coffee but who isn’t these days… <strong>Anna Löwenmark</strong> - the beautiful and powerful solo singer of the Gospel track  “Every Day” has a powerfully positive personality and this shines through the whole song. <strong>Rebecka Wendesten</strong> hopped in over a night and hit up the solo on the song “Don’t Worry” just right in a few takes. Very few can do that and do it so well. I stand amazed. <strong>Marko Jelaca</strong> is the versatile jazz drummer playing hip hop, rock and country beats on three tracks.  (His first album, where he played the drums and produced it, won him an award for best jazz album of the year in Spain). <strong>Dan Holmström</strong> has a way with the saxophone that fits my style perfectly. He, too, is a professional jazz artist and is always doing a concert somewhere soon. <strong>P O Larson: </strong>dobro, has his own production company in the Northern part of Sweden his solo on the song Those Eyes is magic, simply magic. <strong>And then there is me, Elisabeth Kitzing: </strong>song, background vocals, guitars, loops, keyboards, mixing, flute and percussions.</p><h3>Our Needs &amp; Your Rewards</h3><p><strong>Why is this campaign important? </strong>This campaign is to help us get the necessary funds to do the mixing, mastering and digital distribution of the CD and to proofread, set and publish the book(e-book format). This is our primary goal. The more funds we get in the better and the faster it goes. And... the world needs more unconditional love!</p><p><strong>If we exceed out goal</strong> we will be able to print physical copies of the book and/or CD. Selling them will, in turn, give us some funds to start doing the next album. It’s all up to you how far this goes! </p><h3>Cost Breakdown for the Change My Mind Project </h3><p><strong>Here is the breakdown of the costs in a diagram form: </strong>and this can be obtained through email.

<li><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">I wanted to create more than just a crowdfunding campaign, I wanted to create a simple, and unique way that you could be involved in an integral part of the project. </span></li>
</ul> <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Your picture(s) will become a part of the mosaic that creates my album art, while your contributions will become the reason I am able to release it. </span><h3> </h3>
<h3><b>Who am I?</b></h3>
<p>If you've stumble across this page, then you probably already know me; <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">But, on the off chance that you don't, I'd like to introduce myself. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">My name is Joey Clarkson, and I am a singer/songwriter from Vancouver Island, Canada. When I'm not writing, recording and touring my music in Canada/USA/Europe: I can be found teaching choral/songwriting workshops for the Wild heart Music program on North Vancouver Island, and musical theatre workshops through my own company in towns throughout Canada and as far away as the UAE, to hundreds of children and youth. I volunteer for various charities on a regular basis - giving back is a priority, and a huge part of my life. </span></p>
<h3><b>Part of the BIGGER picture (continued)</b></h3>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">This will be my first release since 2013, and in a way: I feel like it is really the first release that will accurately represent me as an artist. I couldn't feel more emotionally ready or excited to share it with you!<br/><br/>This EP is comprised of songs from the heart - exploring the dynamics of different relationships, and the experiences and feelings that are a result of those relationships. </span><span style=""background-color: initial;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Working with Steven McClintock and Kevin Fisher to bring these songs to life, we have created an </span>intricate<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> collection that is both relatable and honest. Their support and belief in this project means the world to me. </span></span></p>
<p>I have never been more proud of a something before in my life. Every time I think about what we are doing as a team, I feel like I am going to burst. It's like I just fallen in love with music, all over again, and I want to scream it to the world.</p>
<h3>About Steven and Kevin:</h3>
<p><strong>Steven McClintock </strong>is a Los Angeles based singer/songwriter, and a music producer with a handful of top 40 hit songs under his belt. Steven has recorded two solo albums, and he won a BMI Songwriter Award for Tiffany's <em>Billboard</em> Hot 100 #6 hit ""All This Time"". </p>
<p><strong>Kevin Fisher </strong>is a multi-platinum selling songwriter. Rascal Flatts, Sara Evans, Uncle Kracker and many others have recorded his songs. As an artist himself, and a writer for others, his songs are being played all over the world. </p>
<p>Steven and Kevin are currently working as a co-producers on my upcoming album</p>
<h3>The Perks:</h3>
<p>The perks involved in this campaign are all based around the concept of your photograph being a part of the album art for the EP. </p>
<p>They start at $25 for the basic contribution, to have your photo included in the Mosaic, and move up in price to include other cool things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Official Poster</li>
<li>Thank you in the liner notes</li>
<li>Listed as an official sponsor</li>
<li>Listed as an executive producer</li>
<li>Private Concerts </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>They make GREAT gifts, and are truly a unique way to contribute to a musical project!</strong><br/> </p>
<h3>$10,000 - The Break Down.</h3>
<div>$10,000 is enough to cover <u>approximately 80% the Studio, Musician, Producer, Mixing and Mastering fees</u> for this project. Please see below for a full breakdown of the expected costs for the entire project, including our stretch goals. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>$10,000 is enough to get the ball rolling, so we have a project that is ready to pitch and promote for a release in the late spring of 2017.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>If we are lucky enough to exceed this goal, we have a <strong>stretch goal of $13,400</strong>. This would pay for all of the studio, musician, producer, mixing and mastering fees, including the fees incurred using Indiegogo as a fundraising platform.<br/><br/>If we manage to exceed our first stretch goal, <strong>we have a DREAM GOAL of $35,000.</strong> This number would greatly help to cover costs that will be associated with the planned promotion and preparation surrounding this project's release.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Why $35,000, you ask? </div>
<div> </div>
</div><div>
<h3>$35,000 - The Break Down.</h3>
<p>This scares me.</p>
<p>When I look at it, it seems like such a huge number. Because it is. </p>
<p>The scariest part is being able to break it down and know that <strong>it is actually the bare minimum </strong>of what we need to release this project, properly. </p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Studio Fees - $4400</span></li>

</div></div>","Part of the BIGGER picture.
 
I am currently recording a new EP with 37 Records (Los Angeles) and I need your help!
Part of the BIGGER picture is a campaign to raise the funds for the production of my new EP with 37 Records (Los Angeles). 
I wanted to create more than just a crowdfunding campaign, I wanted to create a simple, and unique way that you could be involved in an integral part of the project. 
 Your picture(s) will become a part of the mosaic that creates my album art, while your contributions will become the reason I am able to release it.  
Who am I?
If you've stumble across this page, then you probably already know me; But, on the off chance that you don't, I'd like to introduce myself. 
My name is Joey Clarkson, and I am a singer/songwriter from Vancouver Island, Canada. When I'm not writing, recording and touring my music in Canada/USA/Europe: I can be found teaching choral/songwriting workshops for the Wild heart Music program on North Vancouver Island, and musical theatre workshops through my own company in towns throughout Canada and as far away as the UAE, to hundreds of children and youth. I volunteer for various charities on a regular basis - giving back is a priority, and a huge part of my life. 
Part of the BIGGER picture (continued)
This will be my first release since 2013, and in a way: I feel like it is really the first release that will accurately represent me as an artist. I couldn't feel more emotionally ready or excited to share it with you!This EP is comprised of songs from the heart - exploring the dynamics of different relationships, and the experiences and feelings that are a result of those relationships. Working with Steven McClintock and Kevin Fisher to bring these songs to life, we have created an intricate collection that is both relatable and honest. Their support and belief in this project means the world to me. 
I have never been more proud of a something before in my life. Every time I think about what we are doing as a team, I feel like I am going to burst. It's like I just fallen in love with music, all over again, and I want to scream it to the world.
About Steven and Kevin:
Steven McClintock is a Los Angeles based singer/songwriter, and a music producer with a handful of top 40 hit songs under his belt. Steven has recorded two solo albums, and he won a BMI Songwriter Award for Tiffany's Billboard Hot 100 #6 hit ""All This Time"". 
Kevin Fisher is a multi-platinum selling songwriter. Rascal Flatts, Sara Evans, Uncle Kracker and many others have recorded his songs. As an artist himself, and a writer for others, his songs are being played all over the world. 
Steven and Kevin are currently working as a co-producers on my upcoming album
The Perks:
The perks involved in this campaign are all based around the concept of your photograph being a part of the album art for the EP. 
They start at $25 for the basic contribution, to have your photo included in the Mosaic, and move up in price to include other cool things like:

Official Poster
Thank you in the liner notes
Listed as an official sponsor
Listed as an executive producer
Private Concerts 

They make GREAT gifts, and are truly a unique way to contribute to a musical project! 
$10,000 - The Break Down.
$10,000 is enough to cover approximately 80% the Studio, Musician, Producer, Mixing and Mastering fees for this project. Please see below for a full breakdown of the expected costs for the entire project, including our stretch goals. 
 
$10,000 is enough to get the ball rolling, so we have a project that is ready to pitch and promote for a release in the late spring of 2017.
 
If we are lucky enough to exceed this goal, we have a stretch goal of $13,400. This would pay for all of the studio, musician, producer, mixing and mastering fees, including the fees incurred using Indiegogo as a fundraising platform.If we manage to exceed our first stretch goal, we have a DREAM GOAL of $35,000. This number would greatly help to cover costs that will be associated with the planned promotion and preparation surrounding this project's release.
 
Why $35,000, you ask? 
 

$35,000 - The Break Down.
This scares me.
When I look at it, it seems like such a huge number. Because it is. 
The scariest part is being able to break it down and know that it is actually the bare minimum of what we need to release this project, properly. 

Studio Fees - $4400
Musician Fees - $5000
Mixing/Mastering - $1200
Production - $1800
Travel - $1500
3 Months of Radio Promotion to Canadian radio for 2 singles - $8000
Canadian RADIO TOUR fund x2 - $2000
Album Photo shoot - $1000
Music Videos - $3500
CD/Cassette/Vinyl Printing - $4000
Indiegogo admin/payment fees - $2600

 

If we do not reach this, or any of our targeted goals: All funds raised will still be put directly towards the production of this project, and we will be exploring alternative methods of funding. This project is my life, and we are prepared to do whatever it takes to make this happen. 


One last thing...
To put it simply: your contributions will actually give this release a fighting chance. 
Your contributions will be the lifeboat in the current sea of sexism, body shaming, low paying streaming websites and declining physical sales that we currently call the music industry. They will be the boat that gives this EP the chance it deserves for survival. I am ready to work my butt off to stay above the water, but I can't do it alone. I need your help!

<p><strong>Short Summary</strong></p>
<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>The New Division is my biggest passion. I vividly remember sitting in my college dorm in Riverside, CA, nearly 8 years ago, after purchasing my first synth, an Alesis Micron. What began as a few experimental songs later developed into a record named ""The Rookie."" Shortly thereafter, I wrote ""Shadows,"" and the rest is history.</p>
<p>I made a decision early on that I wanted this project to be completely DIY, and fortunately, The New Division continues to remain vibrant all these years later. That, is all because of YOU. Every time you've purchased a record on iTunes, streamed it on Spotify, purchased a CD/Vinyl, or even shared it with a friend, YOU are the reason The New Division has made it this far.</p>
<p>I started The New Division all those years back with a very clear objective--one that remains true today --If The New Division is to ever succeed, it would have to do so in a DIY fashion. As many of you are aware, over the past few years, the music industry has taken a significant hit, and for artists like myself, it has become nearly impossible to make ends meet solely from putting out records.</p>
<p>This campaign is my way asking you, the loyal fan, for help. I need you to help me release this next EP, <i>Precision</i>. If The New Division is to move forward, it will be because of your contribution.</p>
<p><strong>What I Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>Here's the deal. On average, every record I've released over the past 7 years has cost roughly around $10,000-$15,000+ (out of my own pocket) per release. Some records, like <i>Gemini, </i>cost even more than that!</p>
<p>If you're wondering how on earth it costs that much to put out a record, here is a breakdown of typical expenses I've encountered over the course of the past few years:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Marketing ­</strong>- Average cost $7,000 - This one should be pretty self-explanatory. From social to digital marketing, this is a crucial area of promotion that goes in hand with any release. Of course, the amount I've budgeted could always be higher, but the resources aren't always available.</li>
<li>
<strong>CD/Vinyl Printing - </strong>Average cost $3,000 - People always ask, ""why no vinyl?"" The simple answer is vinyl is incredibly expensive to print, about 8x the amount of CDs. They also don't sell nearly as well, given vinyl's tend to appeal more to Americans (versus the rest of the world!). Regardless of sales or cost, I've always printed CDs and have plans to press <i>The Rookie, Shadows, Night Escape, </i>etc.</li>
<li>
<strong>Mastering </strong>- Average cost $1,200. Mastering is the final stage in the production process. While in the ""old"" days I used to master my own records, I stopped during the production of Night Escape, as I realized it was better to leave it to a professional, in an actual mastering house, with proper mastering techniques.</li>
<li>
<strong>Music Videos</strong> - Average cost $3,000. This is an area I haven't spent a great deal on, and if anyone wonders why The New Division doesn't have a large amount of music videos, it is because they are quite expensive to make and few are willing to do them for free. With that said, <i>Precision </i>will feature two awesome videos that will hopefully be pleasing to you.<br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>Radio Play</strong> - Average cost $2,300 - It's odd to think that one has to pay to get played on the radio, but it is a fact, unless you happen to write a summer anthem that charts incredibly well.<div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/ug31PKs4dgY"" width=""640""></iframe></div>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Production </strong>- Average cost: Unknown - This is the area that many take for granted, but actually to likely the highest bracket. I typically spend anywhere from 30 to 120 hours on each New Division song you've ever heard. If you don't believe me, I would be happy to send you a screen shot from one of my many project files that I’ve worked on.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, enough with all the boring stuff. Let's talk about what YOU GET when you help support my next release.</p>
<p>There are a number of prizes in this campaign. Please refer to them on them sidebar.</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I've always hoped, that The New Division extended beyond my ambitions, and actually meant something to you. Over the years I've received so many awesome letters from several of you, sharing your experiences with how you've interpreted or digested the music, and it's made me realize that what has kept me going all these years has been the immense support you've all given me.</p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The question is, ""What happens if we don't reach the goal?"" It's a simple answer, but essentially <i>Precision</i> will not be available in CD/Vinyl format for quite some time (until I can recuperate other, pending expenses), the release will have to get delayed probably until Summer of 2017 (instead of January, 2017), and quite honestly, will probably have to be my last releases for quite some time. It also means that <i>Shadows</i>, <i>The Rookie</i>, and several other releases, will not receive re-issues anytime soon.</p>
<p>While this sounds quite depressing, I'm not worried about it as I'm confident that you can help me reach this goal!</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>It makes complete sense to me that some of you cannot contribute financially, and that is perfectly okay. I only ask that you spread the word, and share this campaign with everyone in your life if you are not in a financial position to make a contribution.

Dear Friends,
The New Division is my biggest passion. I vividly remember sitting in my college dorm in Riverside, CA, nearly 8 years ago, after purchasing my first synth, an Alesis Micron. What began as a few experimental songs later developed into a record named ""The Rookie."" Shortly thereafter, I wrote ""Shadows,"" and the rest is history.
I made a decision early on that I wanted this project to be completely DIY, and fortunately, The New Division continues to remain vibrant all these years later. That, is all because of YOU. Every time you've purchased a record on iTunes, streamed it on Spotify, purchased a CD/Vinyl, or even shared it with a friend, YOU are the reason The New Division has made it this far.
I started The New Division all those years back with a very clear objective--one that remains true today --If The New Division is to ever succeed, it would have to do so in a DIY fashion. As many of you are aware, over the past few years, the music industry has taken a significant hit, and for artists like myself, it has become nearly impossible to make ends meet solely from putting out records.
This campaign is my way asking you, the loyal fan, for help. I need you to help me release this next EP, Precision. If The New Division is to move forward, it will be because of your contribution.
What I Need & What You Get
Here's the deal. On average, every record I've released over the past 7 years has cost roughly around $10,000-$15,000+ (out of my own pocket) per release. Some records, like Gemini, cost even more than that!
If you're wondering how on earth it costs that much to put out a record, here is a breakdown of typical expenses I've encountered over the course of the past few years:


Marketing ­- Average cost $7,000 - This one should be pretty self-explanatory. From social to digital marketing, this is a crucial area of promotion that goes in hand with any release. Of course, the amount I've budgeted could always be higher, but the resources aren't always available.

CD/Vinyl Printing - Average cost $3,000 - People always ask, ""why no vinyl?"" The simple answer is vinyl is incredibly expensive to print, about 8x the amount of CDs. They also don't sell nearly as well, given vinyl's tend to appeal more to Americans (versus the rest of the world!). Regardless of sales or cost, I've always printed CDs and have plans to press The Rookie, Shadows, Night Escape, etc.

Mastering - Average cost $1,200. Mastering is the final stage in the production process. While in the ""old"" days I used to master my own records, I stopped during the production of Night Escape, as I realized it was better to leave it to a professional, in an actual mastering house, with proper mastering techniques.

Music Videos - Average cost $3,000. This is an area I haven't spent a great deal on, and if anyone wonders why The New Division doesn't have a large amount of music videos, it is because they are quite expensive to make and few are willing to do them for free. With that said, Precision will feature two awesome videos that will hopefully be pleasing to you. 

Radio Play - Average cost $2,300 - It's odd to think that one has to pay to get played on the radio, but it is a fact, unless you happen to write a summer anthem that charts incredibly well.


Production - Average cost: Unknown - This is the area that many take for granted, but actually to likely the highest bracket. I typically spend anywhere from 30 to 120 hours on each New Division song you've ever heard. If you don't believe me, I would be happy to send you a screen shot from one of my many project files that I’ve worked on.

Now, enough with all the boring stuff. Let's talk about what YOU GET when you help support my next release.
There are a number of prizes in this campaign. Please refer to them on them sidebar.
The Impact
I've always hoped, that The New Division extended beyond my ambitions, and actually meant something to you. Over the years I've received so many awesome letters from several of you, sharing your experiences with how you've interpreted or digested the music, and it's made me realize that what has kept me going all these years has been the immense support you've all given me.
Risks & Challenges
The question is, ""What happens if we don't reach the goal?"" It's a simple answer, but essentially Precision will not be available in CD/Vinyl format for quite some time (until I can recuperate other, pending expenses), the release will have to get delayed probably until Summer of 2017 (instead of January, 2017), and quite honestly, will probably have to be my last releases for quite some time. It also means that Shadows, The Rookie, and several other releases, will not receive re-issues anytime soon.
While this sounds quite depressing, I'm not worried about it as I'm confident that you can help me reach this goal!
Other Ways You Can Help
It makes complete sense to me that some of you cannot contribute financially, and that is perfectly okay. I only ask that you spread the word, and share this campaign with everyone in your life if you are not in a financial position to make a contribution. Literally, all you need to do is spread the word, and remember to use the Indiegogo share tools that are provided in this campaign. Set a goal, share it with 5 friends! Who knows, maybe they'll become fans as well!

</h3> <p>Over the past 9 months an Experiment in Musical Exploration has been incubating here in the Studios at Vacation Land. It is called DISASTA and it is the first Chainsaw Red album! DISASTA is an old Country/Folk album, the likes of which hasn't been seen in Nashville in a long long time. We call it Jimmie Rodgers' Velvet Nihilism and Narcotic Ragtime and I feel confident if you get all of that you will love this record. If not... Well you will probably still like it you just don't know it yet! Check out the video for 'Little Brown Stain', the first track on the Album, posted above to get a good idea of what we are talking about.<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>We have the Album Recorded, Mixed, and Mastered. 13 Beautiful Tracks are ready to go! We have the Digital Release date set for June 30th and everything is in order for the iTunes, Spotify, etc. to happen on that day (digital pre-sale begins June 23rd). Now we want to make some Physical Media! <br/></p> <ul> <li>CD's are expensive if you want them done right. We don't want CD-R's that won't work in your Playstation or your 94' Corrola. We want real deal, glass master, Compact Discs... And the minimum cost for that is just under $800 for 300 copies (the minimum quantity order amount).<br/>
</li> <li>So we want you to buy a copy now! $10 gets you your very own copy of the CD mailed to you at your home or dwelling; once the Campaign is completed and the CD Order is made. So when we get them you get yours mailed to you!<br/>
</li> <li>IF we don't make the full amount to print real CDs we will sell what we need to make up the difference. Just watch for our Kidney Sale on the Black Market. Seriously. We will get this done by hook or crook but it would be a lot better to just do it with advance sales to you!<br/>

<h3>The Who and the Why</h3>
<p>My name is Joel Procter and I am a Christian worship songwriter from Australia with a passion to see people experience Jesus in a profound way through music.</p>
<p>My wife Tamika and I, along with our children, have a goal to raise $6000 to fund and release my second Christmas EP.</p>
<p>In 2015 I recorded 'Let Us Sing - Christmas', a dynamic and fresh compilation of 5 classic Christmas carols. The purpose of the project was to record Christmas songs that contain the message of Jesus. The encouragement and support I received from this release has birthed a new desire to release part 2 of this Christmas project.</p>
<p>Christmas carols are incredibly powerful in that they are a natural and accepted part of the Christmas season. For this reason, I have specifically chosen songs for this new project that speak about Jesus and His birth. This EP is an <strong>opportunity</strong> to spread the message of Jesus to people that do not yet know Him.</p>
<h2><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1499835159/fcq0emrb3cgrhrnljvey.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></h2>
<h2>The Songs</h2>
<p>This year I need your help to record 5 brand new versions of these classic carols:</p>
<p>Angels we Have Heard on High<br/>Away in a Manger<br/>O Holy Night<br/>Mary Did You Know<br/>Hark the Heralds Angels Sing</p>
<p><i><strong>*Remember that this project does not get recorded if we do not reach our fundraising goal*</strong></i></p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>To create an excellent and incredible project we need to raise $6000.</p>
<p>These funds go towards:</p>
<ul>
<li>Studio costs - $3450</li>
<li>Musician Hire - $1200</li>
<li>Physical CD Printing - $1200</li>
<li>Graphic Design and Video - $150</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What You Get!</strong></p>
<p>To thank each and every contributor we have some exciting and unique perks for those who give at every level.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Every donation</strong> over $10 gets a digital pre order of the new Christmas EP.</li>
<li>Other great perks on offer are digital and physical copies of the original Christmas EP, signed copies of my worship album 'In The Fire', inclusion in the EP credits, personal phone and skype calls, <b>exclusive access to pre-production audio from the EP</b>, cover songs of your choosing and much more. (see to the right for full list)</li>
<li>If we do not reach $6000 I will create as many songs as possible to be released at Christmas. Sadly physical CD's and some perks are only available if we reach our total goal.</li>
<li>Feel free to donate any amount or claim a unique perk of your choosing.<br/> </li>
</ul>

<h2> </h2>
<h2><strong>Stretch Goals</strong></h2>
<p>If we are able to raise more than our initial goal it will enable us to add two extra acoustic carols to the EP and increase our marketing reach as well as releasing funds to record YouTube videos of some of the songs.</p>
<p>Stretch Goal 1: $7000 - 2 additional acoustic songs<br/>Stretch Goal 2: $8000 - 2 additional acoustic songs + YouTube Video</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>In every project there is a risk that it may not be successful. My greatest hope is that this campaign raises all the funds needed to create an incredible recording. If this doesn't happen however, it does not mean the end, but it does mean a change to the project.</p>
<p>If the campaign goal is not reached the achieved funds will be used to record as many single songs as possible that will be released during the Christmas period.</p>
</div><div>
<p><strong>Please share this campaign with your family, friends and networks so that we can achieve something amazing this Christmas.</strong></p>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>Things to Remember</h2>
<ul>
<li>We need $6000 to create 5 incredible Christmas songs that <strong>you</strong> will love.</li>
<li>This project only happens if we reach our goal.</li>
<li>This project is designed to reach people that don't hear about Jesus at any other time in the year.</li>
<li>Your contribution goes towards helping with the costs of making this EP happen.</li>

If we do not reach $6000 I will create as many songs as possible to be released at Christmas. Sadly physical CD's and some perks are only available if we reach our total goal.
Feel free to donate any amount or claim a unique perk of your choosing. 


 
Stretch Goals
If we are able to raise more than our initial goal it will enable us to add two extra acoustic carols to the EP and increase our marketing reach as well as releasing funds to record YouTube videos of some of the songs.
Stretch Goal 1: $7000 - 2 additional acoustic songsStretch Goal 2: $8000 - 2 additional acoustic songs + YouTube Video

 
Risks & Challenges
In every project there is a risk that it may not be successful. My greatest hope is that this campaign raises all the funds needed to create an incredible recording. If this doesn't happen however, it does not mean the end, but it does mean a change to the project.
If the campaign goal is not reached the achieved funds will be used to record as many single songs as possible that will be released during the Christmas period.

Please share this campaign with your family, friends and networks so that we can achieve something amazing this Christmas.
 
Things to Remember

We need $6000 to create 5 incredible Christmas songs that you will love.
This project only happens if we reach our goal.
This project is designed to reach people that don't hear about Jesus at any other time in the year.
Your contribution goes towards helping with the costs of making this EP happen.

<h3>""Reason Why They're Green"" by Shining Lion: A Short Summary</h3>
<p>Aho and many blessings to all of our loved ones, friends and fans both new and old!  </p>
<p>This crowd funding campaigned has been created to repay and honor all of the people involved with the filming and production who have been working for free for the last four months in order to complete the ""Reason Why They're Green"" music.  Shining Lion believes that contributors fund ideas they can be passionate about and give money to people they trust. The idea that is being highlighted here is a unique and exciting piece; it is the most anticipated, eco-friendly, holistic hip-hop song ever composed!  ""Reason Why They're Green"" and it's visual representation exceeds expectations in terms of artistic merit, social impact and revolutionary content!  Shining Lion has a proven track record of producing incredible, revolutionary reggae &amp; hip-hop music.  They are now on their fourth album and ""Reason Why They're Green"" will be the fifth large scale music video produced and by far the most elaborate!  For over fifteen years environmental justice, world peace and universal love have become reoccurring themes in Shining Lion’s musical repertoire. Shining Lion downloads cosmic sounds from the Universe to inspire change and gives a voice to the growing alternative lifestyles, the green energy movement and cross-cultural consciousness. Shining Lion is a transformational reggae, world music and hip hop ensemble influenced by greats like Bob Marley, the Fugees and the Roots.  The group founded by Shine Rilling whose lyrics are paradigm shifting and uplifting and has featured the voices of incredible female vocalist such as Shyla Ray Sunshine and Juno Brown, both recorded and live.  For over ten years environmental justice, world peace and universal love have all been reoccurring themes in Shining Lion’s repertoire. The combination of the male-female vocal dynamic creates a divine swirl of beautiful harmonies paired with revolutionary ideas which paint a gorgeous portrait of musical talent and a creative, sustainable vision for the future.  The mission of Shining Lion is to inspire people to heal and harmonize with the highest good of the earth! </p>
<ul>
<li>The ""Reason Why They're Green"" music video is important to the global community because it expresses sentiments of divestment, progression and environmental justice, all topics which are usually discussed in traditional folk music styles,traditionally accompanied by banjos and acoustic guitars, however this song is sharing an eco-friendly message on top of a hiphop beat, crossing over genres, cultural, racial and economic barriers.  The lead character in the video is George Washington, played by Shine, brings a full-circle feeling to the American narrative, an opportunity to create our own future instead of living in the mistakes of our ancestors, giving a moment for the wrongs to be rectified by learning new ways and means to repair the damages of the industrial age and to evolve our modern world. Shine, the band’s lead vocalist and song-writer, dresses up as a time-traveling George Washington who enters 2017 to learn how money (green papers) to heal the earth.  It is a true story of divestment and environmental rehabilitation.</li>
<li>The magnitude of what you as a contributor will help us achieve is immense.  Shining Lion isn't a one-trick pony.  The musical multi media empire is in it's incubation phase and with your donation, you can expect to see not only the ""Reason Why They're Green"" music video, but visuals for at least three more music videos from the ""One Love Vibration"" album.  With your donations Shining Lion can finally release the earth-shifting music video!  The music video has already been filmed, however in order to complete and release the music video globally, the editors, camera people, casting directors and cast need to be paid. Reaching the initial goal of $11,111 will enable Shining Lion to pay our diligent film and editing crew, casting director and members of the cast.  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
</div><div>
<p>Let's break it down in more detail:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>This campaign calls on the power of community to manifest an initial fundraising goal of  $11,111 within only 14 days to pay for the production fees of the music video ""Reason Why They're Green"". Donations received will go directly to recouping Shining Lion for all up front cost associated with the filming of the music video including camera rentals, costume rentals, editing fees, casting agent, cast, transportation, administrative fees, and everything in between.</p>
<p>There are three possible tiers to the campaign as mentioned earlier, we are in the seeding phase of a musical multi media empire. With the power of $11,111 one music video “Reason Why They’re Green” will be completed and that would be such a phenomenal achievement.  We would like to stretch our goal when we reach our initial goal of $11,111 the second goal of $22,222 two music videos will be completed.  At the $33,333 there would be more than enough to complete all three music videos and devote a portion of the funds to recording and releasing another EP and album in 2018.</p>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>Perks &amp; Prizes</strong></p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Shining Lion wants you to know as much about this campaign as possible. Your difference their contribution will make a difference, not just in their pocket, but in the Global Green Scene!</p>
<ul>
<li>Shining Lion's project is valuable to the you as a contributor and to the world.  <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">You will not just be contributing to the funding of one music video, you are bringing to fruition the life long dream of the Shining Lion Team, particularly Shine and Juno Brown. It is their Divine Purpose to share their voices, ideas and music with the world.  You have the power to make their creative dreams turn into a reality.  This is something you will not see on your teLIEvision, this is not a music video that would come out of this current system or our modern civiLIEzation, you and the greater transformational community will essentially serve as the executive producers and producers for this music, WE are becoming our own network.  You ARE the change maker in this world!  Making incredible, revolutionary musical content is one of the major career goals of Shining Lion!  This fundraiser exist because Shining Lion and the entire production crew believes that this is possible and you are in control of the future of media; jump in a cast your votes with your money.  Tell the world what you want to see! If you support progressive, positive music for all generations, donate to this campaign.  Independent artist can continue producing amazing content, but only with </span><i style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">your </i><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">help.</span>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Shining Lion has a</span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;""> successful track record with projects like this.  I mean, George Washington traveled through time,</span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;""> all the way from 1789, to give this project a thumbs up! </span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Shining Lion has independently funded four independently recorded albums and a handful of powerful music videos including their ""Loving the Water (Standing Rock Song)"" music video which currently has  147,000 views.  Projected estimates for the viewing of the ""Reason Why They're Green"" video will be in the millions.  </span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Shining Lion believes that contributors fund ideas they can be passionate about and to people they trust. Shining Lion has a proven track record of producing incredible revolutionary music.  They are now on their fourth album and ""Reason Why They're Green"" will be the fourth large scale music video and by far the most elaborate!  For over fifteen years environmental justice, world peace and universal love have become reoccurring themes in Shining Lion’s musical repertoire.</span>
</li>
<li>To be really real, Shining Lion is a modern day family band composed of adults who hold down entrepreneurial enterprises, day jobs, not to mention raising children; this creative group is composed of individuals, who despite what society says you have to do once you reach a certain age or have a certain amount of responsibilities should or shouldn't do, persisted with their careers as professional recording artist and musicians.  Knowing the full story helps to build trust with you as a donor.  No one in the production crew has a trust fund; this is a campaign by real artist who genuinely request your help to bring this project to fruition. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>You as a donor value transparency. Shining Lion wants to be open and provide insight into the risks and obstacles that may come up on the way to reaching this goal.</p>
<ul>
<li>What qualifies Shining Lion to overcome these hurdles?  Hmm, good question.  Well, for starters the Shining Lion production team is composed of five young, yet experienced and highly dedicated entertainment professionals.  There's a very slim chance that the ball will be dropped. Shining Lion also has elders and experts from the Elevate Conscious Production company/team advising us on how to utilize social media to its highest power.  Among the five individuals, at any juncture of obstacle one of the five people are fully willing to jump in to save the day, whether that means brainstorming or calling in 'special favors'.  Shining Lion anticipates a smooth and successful campaign.  Having more than one person involved in the production and the projection of the fundraiser gives them all a feeling of security and hopefully gives you, as the donor, a feeling of security moving forward. Not to mention, that the product that the money is being raised for has already been shot.  The music video for ""Reason Why They're Green"" is in the post-production phase, meaning that the video is almost done, and what needs to happen will happen in the editing room.</li>
<li>Shining Lion's strategy for solving these challenges entails relying on our human resources team.</li>
</ul>

Aho and many blessings to all of our loved ones, friends and fans both new and old!  
This crowd funding campaigned has been created to repay and honor all of the people involved with the filming and production who have been working for free for the last four months in order to complete the ""Reason Why They're Green"" music.  Shining Lion believes that contributors fund ideas they can be passionate about and give money to people they trust. The idea that is being highlighted here is a unique and exciting piece; it is the most anticipated, eco-friendly, holistic hip-hop song ever composed!  ""Reason Why They're Green"" and it's visual representation exceeds expectations in terms of artistic merit, social impact and revolutionary content!  Shining Lion has a proven track record of producing incredible, revolutionary reggae & hip-hop music.  They are now on their fourth album and ""Reason Why They're Green"" will be the fifth large scale music video produced and by far the most elaborate!  For over fifteen years environmental justice, world peace and universal love have become reoccurring themes in Shining Lion’s musical repertoire. Shining Lion downloads cosmic sounds from the Universe to inspire change and gives a voice to the growing alternative lifestyles, the green energy movement and cross-cultural consciousness. Shining Lion is a transformational reggae, world music and hip hop ensemble influenced by greats like Bob Marley, the Fugees and the Roots.  The group founded by Shine Rilling whose lyrics are paradigm shifting and uplifting and has featured the voices of incredible female vocalist such as Shyla Ray Sunshine and Juno Brown, both recorded and live.  For over ten years environmental justice, world peace and universal love have all been reoccurring themes in Shining Lion’s repertoire. The combination of the male-female vocal dynamic creates a divine swirl of beautiful harmonies paired with revolutionary ideas which paint a gorgeous portrait of musical talent and a creative, sustainable vision for the future.  The mission of Shining Lion is to inspire people to heal and harmonize with the highest good of the earth! 

The ""Reason Why They're Green"" music video is important to the global community because it expresses sentiments of divestment, progression and environmental justice, all topics which are usually discussed in traditional folk music styles,traditionally accompanied by banjos and acoustic guitars, however this song is sharing an eco-friendly message on top of a hiphop beat, crossing over genres, cultural, racial and economic barriers.  The lead character in the video is George Washington, played by Shine, brings a full-circle feeling to the American narrative, an opportunity to create our own future instead of living in the mistakes of our ancestors, giving a moment for the wrongs to be rectified by learning new ways and means to repair the damages of the industrial age and to evolve our modern world. Shine, the band’s lead vocalist and song-writer, dresses up as a time-traveling George Washington who enters 2017 to learn how money (green papers) to heal the earth.  It is a true story of divestment and environmental rehabilitation.
The magnitude of what you as a contributor will help us achieve is immense.  Shining Lion isn't a one-trick pony.  The musical multi media empire is in it's incubation phase and with your donation, you can expect to see not only the ""Reason Why They're Green"" music video, but visuals for at least three more music videos from the ""One Love Vibration"" album.  With your donations Shining Lion can finally release the earth-shifting music video!  The music video has already been filmed, however in order to complete and release the music video globally, the editors, camera people, casting directors and cast need to be paid. Reaching the initial goal of $11,111 will enable Shining Lion to pay our diligent film and editing crew, casting director and members of the cast.  

What We Need & What You Get

Let's break it down in more detail:

This campaign calls on the power of community to manifest an initial fundraising goal of  $11,111 within only 14 days to pay for the production fees of the music video ""Reason Why They're Green"". Donations received will go directly to recouping Shining Lion for all up front cost associated with the filming of the music video including camera rentals, costume rentals, editing fees, casting agent, cast, transportation, administrative fees, and everything in between.
There are three possible tiers to the campaign as mentioned earlier, we are in the seeding phase of a musical multi media empire. With the power of $11,111 one music video “Reason Why They’re Green” will be completed and that would be such a phenomenal achievement.  We would like to stretch our goal when we reach our initial goal of $11,111 the second goal of $22,222 two music videos will be completed.  At the $33,333 there would be more than enough to complete all three music videos and devote a portion of the funds to recording and releasing another EP and album in 2018.

The Impact
Shining Lion wants you to know as much about this campaign as possible. Your difference their contribution will make a difference, not just in their pocket, but in the Global Green Scene!

Shining Lion's project is valuable to the you as a contributor and to the world.  You will not just be contributing to the funding of one music video, you are bringing to fruition the life long dream of the Shining Lion Team, particularly Shine and Juno Brown. It is their Divine Purpose to share their voices, ideas and music with the world.  You have the power to make their creative dreams turn into a reality.  This is something you will not see on your teLIEvision, this is not a music video that would come out of this current system or our modern civiLIEzation, you and the greater transformational community will essentially serve as the executive producers and producers for this music, WE are becoming our own network.  You ARE the change maker in this world!  Making incredible, revolutionary musical content is one of the major career goals of Shining Lion!  This fundraiser exist because Shining Lion and the entire production crew believes that this is possible and you are in control of the future of media; jump in a cast your votes with your money.  Tell the world what you want to see! If you support progressive, positive music for all generations, donate to this campaign.  Independent artist can continue producing amazing content, but only with your help.


Shining Lion has a successful track record with projects like this.  I mean, George Washington traveled through time, all the way from 1789, to give this project a thumbs up! Shining Lion has independently funded four independently recorded albums and a handful of powerful music videos including their ""Loving the Water (Standing Rock Song)"" music video which currently has  147,000 views.  Projected estimates for the viewing of the ""Reason Why They're Green"" video will be in the millions.  Shining Lion believes that contributors fund ideas they can be passionate about and to people they trust. Shining Lion has a proven track record of producing incredible revolutionary music.  They are now on their fourth album and ""Reason Why They're Green"" will be the fourth large scale music video and by far the most elaborate!  For over fifteen years environmental justice, world peace and universal love have become reoccurring themes in Shining Lion’s musical repertoire.

To be really real, Shining Lion is a modern day family band composed of adults who hold down entrepreneurial enterprises, day jobs, not to mention raising children; this creative group is composed of individuals, who despite what society says you have to do once you reach a certain age or have a certain amount of responsibilities should or shouldn't do, persisted with their careers as professional recording artist and musicians.  Knowing the full story helps to build trust with you as a donor.  No one in the production crew has a trust fund; this is a campaign by real artist who genuinely request your help to bring this project to fruition. 


Risks & Challenges
You as a donor value transparency. Shining Lion wants to be open and provide insight into the risks and obstacles that may come up on the way to reaching this goal.

What qualifies Shining Lion to overcome these hurdles?  Hmm, good question.  Well, for starters the Shining Lion production team is composed of five young, yet experienced and highly dedicated entertainment professionals.  There's a very slim chance that the ball will be dropped. Shining Lion also has elders and experts from the Elevate Conscious Production company/team advising us on how to utilize social media to its highest power.  Among the five individuals, at any juncture of obstacle one of the five people are fully willing to jump in to save the day, whether that means brainstorming or calling in 'special favors'.  Shining Lion anticipates a smooth and successful campaign.  Having more than one person involved in the production and the projection of the fundraiser gives them all a feeling of security and hopefully gives you, as the donor, a feeling of security moving forward. Not to mention, that the product that the money is being raised for has already been shot.  The music video for ""Reason Why They're Green"" is in the post-production phase, meaning that the video is almost done, and what needs to happen will happen in the editing room.
Shining Lion's strategy for solving these challenges entails relying on our human resources team.

<h2 align=""center""><strong>The Vision</strong></h2>
<p align=""center""> </p>
<p>I have been crafting these songs for years and bringing them near close to perfection (because nothing is really perfect). Some are newer than others, some you’ve never heard before. One thing they all have in common is that they tell my story, because I’ve been through a lot over the years and I want to bare it all. It’s been quite the growing process for me the last few years and I’ve learned a lot. I want to share it all with you through my music.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The sound will be pure rock ‘n’ roll mixed with electronic and blues sounds. Heavy guitars, haunting melodies that tell a story, deep gritty bass and drums that make you want to move. The album will include slower, more intimate songs that really make you think about life and hard hitting fast tunes that make you want to throw your hands up in the air. I’ll take you from sultry bedroom songs straight into the mosh pit!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When I got sober almost four years ago there was a lot that was unknown to me, but one thing that was clear was that I wanted to reach out and connect with people through my music. Whether you’ve battled addiction or other hardships in life there are two common factors in recovery and those are hope and faith. We tend to shut down and become silent when we are going through really trying times but I decided to do the exact opposite because I wanted to help others by sharing my experiences. We all deal with really hard stuff in life and it’s ok to feel down, but when we can unite and heal one another with love, compassion and honesty the suffering isn’t so bad.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This album will tell my story and spread hope to the world. I invite you to come along!</p>
<p> </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>The Production</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>After many rehearsals with my amazing band we have everything locked down and are ready to get into the studio. We have already started laying the foundation for some of the tracks. We will be recording most of the album at <u>The Dungeon Recording Studio</u> in North Miami, FL helmed by Fred Freeman. There is a great vibe and great sound in that studio which is exactly what this album needs!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I am working with an amazing and well accomplished producer, Francisco Del. Del has written and produced music for: Pitbull, Gloria Estefan, Jon Secada, KC &amp; The Sunshine Band and many more. He is credited with 1 gold and 1 platinum record and during his solo career signed to WEA he landed on the charts in 2005. Billboard R&amp;B at number 52 with the remake of the George Michael classic “Careless Whisper”. That same year, Del performed on Soul Train. He also remixed a number 1 dance single for Kabah in Puerto Rico. In the Latin market, Del has written and produced with artists Thalia, Celia Cruz, Soraya, AB Quintanilla, Yuri, Paulina Rubio to name a few.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As an actor and extra, He appeared in several music videos and movies: Ricky Martin’s “She Bangs”, Celine Dion’s “A New Day”, Shakira's ""Me Quedes Tu"" as her hairstylist, CSI Miami, Bad Boys II, and Out of Time. Del has recorded movie soundtracks for Cellular (Kim Bassinger), Private Lessons, Miami Hustle and Stonerville. Del has also produced a song for the award winning video game “Fight Night 2005”.</p>

Del’s band received international and national recognition through the reality T.V. show on FUSE, Bodog Battle of the Bands. 10,000 bands battled and Big Bang Radio placed 3rd and received 3 months of international television time on the show also starring Johnny Rotten and Billy Duffy.</p>

<p>Something that is very important to me with this project is involving like-minded creatives—people I know and respect as musicians. Tony Alarcon, a well known Miami guitarist and front man, will be providing this album with killer guitar solos and riffs. Sean Bauzay, who played drums for my last project, <i>Revlover</i>, will be taking percussion to the next level. I’ve already had one day in the studio with him and all I can say is “wow”! I knew I had a good drummer, but you don’t REALLY know until you get into the studio. This guy destroys it! Lastly, the newest member of the <i>MORRISON</i> outfit, Jian Beckford, will bring you bass lines so deep and fuzzy you might need to shave after listening. This guy brings it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Once tracking is completed, the songs will be mixed by my dear friend and extraordinary engineer Dave Albert. This guy’s ears are like gold. He mixed my last two singles and brought them to a whole other level. After all the songs are sent out for mastering I’ll be distributing to every major streaming service and then some—making sure you can listen along virtually anywhere you want. In this day it doesn’t make too much sense to distribute CDs because who still buys those? And for the few people that do, I’ll be happy to burn you a CD. By saving money on that I’ll be able to invest in some really cool merch for you. Instead of having a CD that sits on a shelf and collects dust, you’ll be able to rock a really cool t-shirt or hat.</p>

</div></div>","The Vision
 
I have been crafting these songs for years and bringing them near close to perfection (because nothing is really perfect). Some are newer than others, some you’ve never heard before. One thing they all have in common is that they tell my story, because I’ve been through a lot over the years and I want to bare it all. It’s been quite the growing process for me the last few years and I’ve learned a lot. I want to share it all with you through my music.
 
The sound will be pure rock ‘n’ roll mixed with electronic and blues sounds. Heavy guitars, haunting melodies that tell a story, deep gritty bass and drums that make you want to move. The album will include slower, more intimate songs that really make you think about life and hard hitting fast tunes that make you want to throw your hands up in the air. I’ll take you from sultry bedroom songs straight into the mosh pit!
 
When I got sober almost four years ago there was a lot that was unknown to me, but one thing that was clear was that I wanted to reach out and connect with people through my music. Whether you’ve battled addiction or other hardships in life there are two common factors in recovery and those are hope and faith. We tend to shut down and become silent when we are going through really trying times but I decided to do the exact opposite because I wanted to help others by sharing my experiences. We all deal with really hard stuff in life and it’s ok to feel down, but when we can unite and heal one another with love, compassion and honesty the suffering isn’t so bad.
 
This album will tell my story and spread hope to the world. I invite you to come along!
 
The Production
 
After many rehearsals with my amazing band we have everything locked down and are ready to get into the studio. We have already started laying the foundation for some of the tracks. We will be recording most of the album at The Dungeon Recording Studio in North Miami, FL helmed by Fred Freeman. There is a great vibe and great sound in that studio which is exactly what this album needs!
 
I am working with an amazing and well accomplished producer, Francisco Del. Del has written and produced music for: Pitbull, Gloria Estefan, Jon Secada, KC & The Sunshine Band and many more. He is credited with 1 gold and 1 platinum record and during his solo career signed to WEA he landed on the charts in 2005. Billboard R&B at number 52 with the remake of the George Michael classic “Careless Whisper”. That same year, Del performed on Soul Train. He also remixed a number 1 dance single for Kabah in Puerto Rico. In the Latin market, Del has written and produced with artists Thalia, Celia Cruz, Soraya, AB Quintanilla, Yuri, Paulina Rubio to name a few.
 
As an actor and extra, He appeared in several music videos and movies: Ricky Martin’s “She Bangs”, Celine Dion’s “A New Day”, Shakira's ""Me Quedes Tu"" as her hairstylist, CSI Miami, Bad Boys II, and Out of Time. Del has recorded movie soundtracks for Cellular (Kim Bassinger), Private Lessons, Miami Hustle and Stonerville. Del has also produced a song for the award winning video game “Fight Night 2005”.
 
As an intern, Del has worked for Dallas Austin producing sound libraries as well as an apprentice for Scott Storch. In 2005, he formed the rock band Big Bang Radio and opened for Duran Duran, Modest Mouse, The Strokes, Foreigner, All American Rejects, Ashlee Simpson, Gnarls Barkley, Common, Nine Inch Nails, VHS Or Beta, Brazilian Girls and many more.

<p>I've been making music my whole life: as a kid on Long Island, NY, in the Boston area as a student at Berklee College of Music and later in numerous rock bands, jazz groups, and musical theater productions, as well as internationally as a performer onboard cruise ships.  I earned my masters in music at Portland State University a few years ago and regularly perform around the Rose City.  Special Purpose started about two years ago, and this recording is a distillation of my professional and personal experiences. </p>

<p>I've been able to cover the costs for recording, however, this is only the first step in the process.  Mixing is the next step, which involves blending the instruments together as well as fine-tuning their sound.  Check out an early mix of the song we've spent the most time on so far, Password:  </p>

<h3>From the #WomenCrush Music Team</h3>
<p>#WCM launched in Spring 2017 and since then has put on over 80 events for rising women songwriters across 13 different cities in the USA and Canada. A project that started with Founder Ashley Kervabon's own desire to find a local music community has now become a small but mighty operation powered by 30 volunteers. Now, with a full board of directors including radio hosts, national touring &amp; recording artists, producers, and experienced industry professionals, #WomenCrush Music is ready to take the next leap and file our 501c3 application so that we can be a tax exempt organization. This will allow us to apply for government grants, corporate sponsorships and so much more!</p>
<p>We have already accomplished so much on little to no budget, but with your help, we can continue to build upon our foundation to reach artists and songwriters across the country and soon, across the world...Our goal is  to raise at least $10K in the next six weeks to be able to cover some startup costs as we prepare for our first huge fundraising push for the new year. The money will go towards the tax exemption process, merchandise, marketing, program costs, and staff education.</p>
<p>Check out our ""About"" video to learn more about our mission, and take a look at the awesome perks we are offering to say “thank you” to our generous donors.  Your support means so much to me, the entire #WCM team, &amp; most importantly, the women in music we are connecting, educating, and inspiring in our current and future chapters</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our goal is to raise $10,000 which will go to the following:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Our 501c3 Tax Exemption Status Application</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Administrative Costs</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">#WCM Merchandise</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Reserve (Savings/Staff Education)</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Program costs (chapter expenses)</p>
<p>If we don’t reach our goal, priority will be given to our tax exemption status application and program costs, followed by administrative costs and merchandise. If we exceed our goal, we will put the rest of the money towards our program costs for 2019 &amp; savings.</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
</div><p>Since the organization’s launch in Spring 2017, our team has made it their mission to connect, educate and inspire rising women songwriters. The organization has hosted over 80 events across 13 cities in the USA and Canada including showcases, networking events, and educational workshops, landing us local and national features in notable media outlets such as Lenny Letter, SF Station, KGW News, and more!</p><p>The aim of this campaign is to raise money for the tax exemption application, program costs, merchandise, and staff education. As with most startup nonprofits, our team has been working out of their passion for the cause, without pay. This crowdfunding campaign, however, will bring #WCM closer to some of its long-term goals which include: providing a salary for the core staff members, stipends for the chapter leaders, competitive base pay for artists and speakers who are a part of ongoing #WCM events, and hiring even more creative women to provide photography/videography services at events.</p><p><i>“This is only the beginning of our ultimate vision  for the organization,” </i>says #WCM Founder Ashley Kervabon. “<i>Longer term, I’d love to be able to get A-list celebrities involved in mentoring our artists and promoting the organization. It is also my ambition to award recording scholarships,  host songwriting retreats, own properties to accommodate touring women artists, and much more!”</i></p><p>#WomenCrush Music has entered the picture at a precise cultural moment when the value of supporting women is being emphasized by individuals and industries stronger than ever. At the same moment, this concern has brought to light the personal challenges and systemic obstacles many women still encounter in their careers. A recent study cited in Billboard reported that in 2017, 83.2% of artists in popular content were men and only 16.8% were women. Of the study’s sample of 2,767 credited songwriters, only 12.3% were female.  Statistics such as these have inspired #WCM to start The Crush blog, where readers can hear stories from women within the music industry; and The #WomenCrush Music Collective, a career-focused Facebook mastermind group. </p><p>With the help of our generous donors, we can continue to spread our mission and create more opportunities &amp; safe spaces for women songwriters everywhere. </p><p> </p><div>

A project that started with Founder Ashley Kervabon's own desire to find a local music community has now become a small but mighty operation powered by 30 volunteers. Now, with a full board of directors including radio hosts, national touring & recording artists, producers, and experienced industry professionals, #WomenCrush Music is ready to take the next leap and file our 501c3 application so that we can be a tax exempt organization. This will allow us to apply for government grants, corporate sponsorships and so much more!
We have already accomplished so much on little to no budget, but with your help, we can continue to build upon our foundation to reach artists and songwriters across the country and soon, across the world...Our goal is  to raise at least $10K in the next six weeks to be able to cover some startup costs as we prepare for our first huge fundraising push for the new year. The money will go towards the tax exemption process, merchandise, marketing, program costs, and staff education.
Check out our ""About"" video to learn more about our mission, and take a look at the awesome perks we are offering to say “thank you” to our generous donors.  Your support means so much to me, the entire #WCM team, & most importantly, the women in music we are connecting, educating, and inspiring in our current and future chapters

What We Need & What You Get
Our goal is to raise $10,000 which will go to the following:
Our 501c3 Tax Exemption Status Application
Administrative Costs
#WCM Merchandise
Reserve (Savings/Staff Education)
Program costs (chapter expenses)
If we don’t reach our goal, priority will be given to our tax exemption status application and program costs, followed by administrative costs and merchandise. If we exceed our goal, we will put the rest of the money towards our program costs for 2019 & savings.
The Impact
Since the organization’s launch in Spring 2017, our team has made it their mission to connect, educate and inspire rising women songwriters. The organization has hosted over 80 events across 13 cities in the USA and Canada including showcases, networking events, and educational workshops, landing us local and national features in notable media outlets such as Lenny Letter, SF Station, KGW News, and more!The aim of this campaign is to raise money for the tax exemption application, program costs, merchandise, and staff education. As with most startup nonprofits, our team has been working out of their passion for the cause, without pay. This crowdfunding campaign, however, will bring #WCM closer to some of its long-term goals which include: providing a salary for the core staff members, stipends for the chapter leaders, competitive base pay for artists and speakers who are a part of ongoing #WCM events, and hiring even more creative women to provide photography/videography services at events.“This is only the beginning of our ultimate vision  for the organization,” says #WCM Founder Ashley Kervabon. “Longer term, I’d love to be able to get A-list celebrities involved in mentoring our artists and promoting the organization. It is also my ambition to award recording scholarships,  host songwriting retreats, own properties to accommodate touring women artists, and much more!”#WomenCrush Music has entered the picture at a precise cultural moment when the value of supporting women is being emphasized by individuals and industries stronger than ever. At the same moment, this concern has brought to light the personal challenges and systemic obstacles many women still encounter in their careers. A recent study cited in Billboard reported that in 2017, 83.2% of artists in popular content were men and only 16.8% were women. Of the study’s sample of 2,767 credited songwriters, only 12.3% were female.  Statistics such as these have inspired #WCM to start The Crush blog, where readers can hear stories from women within the music industry; and The #WomenCrush Music Collective, a career-focused Facebook mastermind group. With the help of our generous donors, we can continue to spread our mission and create more opportunities & safe spaces for women songwriters everywhere.

<p> </p>
<h3>Love &amp; Loss</h3>
<p><strong>Love &amp; Loss</strong> is my first solo album, featuring some of my favorite songs and arias by Purcell, Handel and Bach. It includes Purcell's charming ""If music be the food of love"" and lovely ""Evening Hymn,"" beloved arias by Bach including ""Komm' in mein Herzenshaus"" and ""Phoebus eilt,"" Handel's devastating ""Per te lasciai la luce,"" and ""Quel fior che all'alba ride,"" which Handel later recycled into a Messiah chorus!</p>
<p>I recorded in May and September of 2018 in two acoustically beautiful halls: Moeser Auditorium at UNC and Fletcher Recital Hall at ECU. I had a fantastic crew of collaborators: Jennifer Streeter on harpsichord &amp; organ, Brent Wissick on viola da gamba and baroque cello, Nicholas DiEugenio on baroque violin, and Stephanie Vial on baroque cello. Our production team was Nathaniel Yaffee, engineer, and Nathan Leaf, producer. Nathan and I have listened to the first edits on some of the tracks, and they sound GREAT. And the album artwork is by the very talented <a href=""https://www.rhianswierat.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Rhian Swierat</a> and is stunning.</p>

<h3>Why I'm Asking You to Help</h3>
<p><strong>Love &amp; Loss</strong> has been years in the making. I'm so proud of all the work that went into it, and excited to share it with the world. The total production cost of this album will be $6,800, and I am looking to raise the first $5,000 of that (or more!) with this campaign. Help me bring <strong>Love &amp; Loss</strong> to life! With your contribution you can be a part of this project along with me, and you'll also get a choice of some great perks, from a sticker to a copy of the album, a sung greeting, an invite to the release listening party, or a private concert in your home.

<div align=""center"">
<b>A Shared Message</b><br/>
</div>It may come as a surprise to those who know me and my mission that I knew very little about Pete Seeger before we met in 2003.  I had heard his name and knew he had written ""Where Have All the Flowers Gone?"" and ""If I Had a Hammer,"" but I had no idea what an amazing human being he was.  After getting to know him, I agree with Harry Belafonte that Pete's image should be carved into Mount Rushmore.  Pete was as much the embodiment of the American Soul as the others represented there.<br/><br/>What got me most about Pete was his belief that we have all the
tools we need to shape ourselves and our world into what we wish them to
be.  For some, these tools are within our
grasp.  For some, they are at arm’s
length.  And for others, they are just
beyond arm’s length.  But they are still
attainable IF we work together.  That belief - that message - was embedded in all of Pete's songs and stories, all of his actions and in every interaction he had with others.  I share that belief wholeheartedly.  I feel it is so important that it MUST be made more present in our public consciousness.  So, I set out shortly after Pete passed to share that message everywhere I go.  It is the thread that holds the ""Keep the Flame Alive"" CD and the ""Remembering Pete Seeger"" World Tour together.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1456788327/hdx3ekzqkozhjoppf2eo.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>                       ""Love Wins"" Concert - September 11, 2011, Kimmel Theater, NYC<br/><br/>
<h3 align=""center""><b>The Songs and the Artists</b></h3>Here's what you'll find on “<i>Pete, Woody and Me, Volume I – Keep the Flame Alive.”</i>  
 It will be a collection of six Pete Seeger songs, two Woody Guthrie songs 
that influenced Pete, and four of my songs profoundly influenced <i>by</i> Pete.  All of them, in one way or another, sing of the tools available to us and where to find them. 
<p><br/>The dozen songs span the spectrum of old to new; songs sung in 
their familiar style or closer to Pete’s original style.  Some songs 
will be sung in a completely new way.  Some are pure fun.  Some are a 
call to arms.  Some are performed solo or with my band.  Some will 
feature special guests like:</p>
<ul>
<li>David Amram (the human intersection of folk, jazz, classical, and movie music)</li>
<li>Freebo (bass player who played with Bonnie Raitt and many others)</li>
<li>Catie Curtis (acclaimed singer-songwriter)</li>
<li>The Local 1000 Traveling Musicians Union Singers</li>
<li>23 young singers from Oklahoma </li>
<li>Paul Prestopino (who toured and recorded as a backup musician for Peter Paul &amp; Mary and John Denver)</li>
<li>Ron Greenstein (bass player for the Chad Mitchell Trio)</li>

<p><br/>Above is a picture from the very last ""Pete Seeger and Friends"" concert.  At age 94 with his voice, dexterity and memory barely working anymore, Pete gave a concert of pure love and humanity.  It was the last time I saw Pete and in many ways it was the best concert he ever gave.  David Amram – recipient of
the 2nd annual Pete and Toshi Seeger Power of Song Award - said this after Pete passed:<br/></p>
<p>“Spook Handy
honors the spirit of Pete Seeger, so excellently, by sharing the <i>music</i> with everyone - on stage and in
the audience - in the same way that Pete did. 
He makes music the star.  That’s
why Pete loved to play with him so often.”  If any of that is true, it is because I learned it from Pete.<br/></p>

 “Pete Woody & Me, Volume I – Keep the Flame Alive” 



After
playing alongside Pete Seeger more than 50 times from 2003 to 2013, I am   recording a CD and touring throughout
the U.S., Canada, and other parts of the globe to share Pete’s songs, stories and message because  I am determined to “KEEP THE FLAME ALIVE.""  I need your help!



A Shared Message
It may come as a surprise to those who know me and my mission that I knew very little about Pete Seeger before we met in 2003.  I had heard his name and knew he had written ""Where Have All the Flowers Gone?"" and ""If I Had a Hammer,"" but I had no idea what an amazing human being he was.  After getting to know him, I agree with Harry Belafonte that Pete's image should be carved into Mount Rushmore.  Pete was as much the embodiment of the American Soul as the others represented there.What got me most about Pete was his belief that we have all the
tools we need to shape ourselves and our world into what we wish them to
be.  For some, these tools are within our
grasp.  For some, they are at arm’s
length.  And for others, they are just
beyond arm’s length.  But they are still
attainable IF we work together.  That belief - that message - was embedded in all of Pete's songs and stories, all of his actions and in every interaction he had with others.  I share that belief wholeheartedly.  I feel it is so important that it MUST be made more present in our public consciousness.  So, I set out shortly after Pete passed to share that message everywhere I go.  It is the thread that holds the ""Keep the Flame Alive"" CD and the ""Remembering Pete Seeger"" World Tour together.                       ""Love Wins"" Concert - September 11, 2011, Kimmel Theater, NYC
The Songs and the ArtistsHere's what you'll find on “Pete, Woody and Me, Volume I – Keep the Flame Alive.”  
 It will be a collection of six Pete Seeger songs, two Woody Guthrie songs 
that influenced Pete, and four of my songs profoundly influenced by Pete.  All of them, in one way or another, sing of the tools available to us and where to find them. 
The dozen songs span the spectrum of old to new; songs sung in 
their familiar style or closer to Pete’s original style.  Some songs 
will be sung in a completely new way.  Some are pure fun.  Some are a 
call to arms.  Some are performed solo or with my band.  Some will 
feature special guests like:

David Amram (the human intersection of folk, jazz, classical, and movie music)
Freebo (bass player who played with Bonnie Raitt and many others)
Catie Curtis (acclaimed singer-songwriter)
The Local 1000 Traveling Musicians Union Singers
23 young singers from Oklahoma 
Paul Prestopino (who toured and recorded as a backup musician for Peter Paul & Mary and John Denver)
Ron Greenstein (bass player for the Chad Mitchell Trio)
and Bob Harris (who played on and produced Johnny Cash recordings).


You Can Help Keep the Flame AliveWith your help through this Indiegogo campaign, the CD will
be distributed and promoted all over North America and beyond.  It will be supported by my “Remembering Pete
Seeger” World Tour of all 50 U.S. states, all 11 Canadian
provinces, and as many other countries as possible (and all 21 New Jersey counties) - in arts centers, concert halls and
theaters, schools and senior centers, colleges and churches.  You can read all about it at www.spookhandy.com/wp/pete.  You can help Keep the Flame Alive with your support of this campaign.                         

I will tell you all about How I Met Pete and ""Founder’s Disease"" in a future video - so stay tuned.

If you have no clue what this page is about or who we are, we’re going to fix that right now. Our name is Pitch Slapped and we are a 14-member co-ed A Cappella group from Berklee College of Music which is located in Boston, Massachusetts. We like to sing, and you can describe our genre as jazz-influenced, contemporary A Cappella music. Since we were founded in 2006, we have done a lot of pretty crazy cool things. We have made appearances on NBC’s The Sing-Off and America’s Got Talent, won the International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella in 2011 and 2014, and this past May, completed a two-week tour through various parts of California (during that tour we also had a video of one of our arrangements go viral, hitting 2 million views in just 3 days).So yeah, with all of that being said, Pitch Slapped wants to do more crazy cool things, and that’s why we have this page! We have been offered a ridiculously amazing opportunity to travel to Xi’an and Beijing, China and perform at different middle schools and high schools in the cities! Who wouldn’t want to travel to a different country to do what they love and help others at the same time? Are we right? During our time in China, we will be performing and working with middle school and high school students on music as well as acting as student ambassadors for Berklee.</strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Though the company that has invited us, our lodging, food, transportation throughout the cities, and attractions are all covered. The only cost we are responsible for is our airfare. That’s pretty great right? Well, with your help, we can do it!</strong></p><h3><u><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></u></h3><p><strong>Pitch Slapped is a self-funded group, meaning that we gig in order to make the money we need to do the activities that we want. This past school year, we saved up all of the money we earned to go on our California tour which took place in May. During our tour in California, we were offered this trip to China and there was no doubt in our minds that we wanted to go. We knew that we would have to figure out how to raise money for China since we used what we had for California. So, we decided to come to Indiegogo and take our chances making some money through donations. </strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>In order to make it to Xi’an and Beijing, we need to raise $15,000. This is how it is broken down: One round-trip ticket to Xi’an, China is $1,000. There are 14 members in our group meaning we need $14,000 for plane tickets. You must then include the taxes and fees that are charged for creating this campaign and the stamps and packaging that will be required to send out the perks we are offering you. So, this is why we are asking for $15,000. If we do not meet our $15,000 goal, we will use the money we have raised for our plane tickets and come up with a bunch of ways to raise the rest!</strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>What’s in it for you? Oh there’s a plenty! For those that donate, there are a list of perks to choose from including:</strong></p><p><strong>A shoutout on our Facebook page</strong></p><p><strong>A video of our tenor, Tyler Pinder-Hudson singing his fastest vocal run</strong></p><p><strong>A Pitch Slapped goodie basket with t-shirts, CD’s, and stickers</strong></p><p><strong>The gift of being an Honorary member of Pitch Slapped. </strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>These are only a few of the perks that we have! The rest are on the right side of this page so check them out!</strong></p><h3><u><strong>The Impact</strong></u></h3><p><strong>Pitch Slapped’s best and most rewarding experiences are the workshops we have done for middle school and high school students. During our time at these schools, we warm-up with the students and listen to some of the songs in their repertoire to give some suggestions and critiques that can better their blend, sound, and overall stage presence. If asked/allowed, we teach them one of our own arrangements to challenge and improve the students sight-reading skills as well as other aspects of music such as dynamics and interpretation of the piece. Lastly, we close out our time in these workshops by singing the arrangement altogether and by answering questions about college and specifically Berklee College of Music. Having the opportunity to work directly with students and give them advice for their music and for their lives is so special because they whole-heartedly listen and appreciate the time and experiences that we share. Watching them learn and receive what we are trying to give them and enjoying each and every moment is what keeps the joy in this group.</strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>This is how our workshops have impacted us, and how they have impacted students around the United States. Now, we are ready to take what we have and bring it outside of the U.S. Middle-and high-school students deserve to have mentors and people around their age that truly believe in their talents and their minds. This can only spread a message of love,  encouragement, and positivity which is what we are striving to do because the world is in need of all of these things.</strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>We have successfully done workshops and performances at a multitude of high schools in New York, Boston, New Hampshire, Idaho, New Jersey, and most recently, California, where we had a 2-week tour traveling to 12 schools from San Francisco to Los Angeles. Workshops play such an important role in our purpose as a group and to take them international to make a difference in a few children’s lives would be a great moment of accomplishment.</strong></p><p> </p><h3><u><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></u></h3><p><strong>Traveling with a student-run group of 14 people to another state is difficult, but traveling to a different country? That is rarely heard of. Most collegiate clubs are happy to host their own events on campus. We have been offered this phenomenal opportunity to travel outside of the United States to share our gift of music to students and their parents in Xi’an and Beijing. This is our shot at breaking the invisible barrier for student-run organizations. This tour to China can not only be a moment of giving back, but a moment of helping others move forward. We as a group are very aware that this tour is a privilege and do not take that for granted, but this trip is not just for us to say we went around the world. This trip is our way of giving back to students, the Berklee community, and the Pitch Slapped members before us. This is our way of proving that we have come so far because of the love and support we have received for the past 10 years, and to show other clubs that it is possible to do what has never been done before. Yes, there are risks taking 14 college kids to China; teaching them to adapt to the Chinese culture, performing in front of a new crowd of people who probably don’t know who they are and may not like what they do, and returning to school and to work. But are these challenges worth going? Apparently, or else we wouldn’t be asking for your help! Pitch Slapped understands all of the potential risks of traveling to China,but they are ready and excited to share their music to the people of Xi’an and Beijing! </strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Pitch Slapped’s overall goal is to bring our jazz-influenced, contemporary A Cappella music to new places and new heights. </strong></p><p><strong>Share what qualifies you to overcome these hurdles.</strong></p><p><strong>Describe your plan for solving these challenges.</strong></p><h3><u><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></u></h3><p><strong>If you are not able to contribute to this Indiegogo, that is perfectly fine! We can still use your help and here’s how! You can share our page on your own social media accounts, follow us on the social media platforms, and spread the word to anywhere and everywhere you can!

If we do not meet our $15,000 goal, we will use the money we have raised for our plane tickets and come up with a bunch of ways to raise the rest! What’s in it for you? Oh there’s a plenty! For those that donate, there are a list of perks to choose from including:A shoutout on our Facebook pageA video of our tenor, Tyler Pinder-Hudson singing his fastest vocal runA Pitch Slapped goodie basket with t-shirts, CD’s, and stickersThe gift of being an Honorary member of Pitch Slapped.  These are only a few of the perks that we have! The rest are on the right side of this page so check them out!The ImpactPitch Slapped’s best and most rewarding experiences are the workshops we have done for middle school and high school students. During our time at these schools, we warm-up with the students and listen to some of the songs in their repertoire to give some suggestions and critiques that can better their blend, sound, and overall stage presence. If asked/allowed, we teach them one of our own arrangements to challenge and improve the students sight-reading skills as well as other aspects of music such as dynamics and interpretation of the piece. Lastly, we close out our time in these workshops by singing the arrangement altogether and by answering questions about college and specifically Berklee College of Music. Having the opportunity to work directly with students and give them advice for their music and for their lives is so special because they whole-heartedly listen and appreciate the time and experiences that we share. Watching them learn and receive what we are trying to give them and enjoying each and every moment is what keeps the joy in this group. This is how our workshops have impacted us, and how they have impacted students around the United States. Now, we are ready to take what we have and bring it outside of the U.S. Middle-and high-school students deserve to have mentors and people around their age that truly believe in their talents and their minds. This can only spread a message of love,  encouragement, and positivity which is what we are striving to do because the world is in need of all of these things. We have successfully done workshops and performances at a multitude of high schools in New York, Boston, New Hampshire, Idaho, New Jersey, and most recently, California, where we had a 2-week tour traveling to 12 schools from San Francisco to Los Angeles. Workshops play such an important role in our purpose as a group and to take them international to make a difference in a few children’s lives would be a great moment of accomplishment. Risks & ChallengesTraveling with a student-run group of 14 people to another state is difficult, but traveling to a different country? That is rarely heard of. Most collegiate clubs are happy to host their own events on campus. We have been offered this phenomenal opportunity to travel outside of the United States to share our gift of music to students and their parents in Xi’an and Beijing. This is our shot at breaking the invisible barrier for student-run organizations. This tour to China can not only be a moment of giving back, but a moment of helping others move forward. We as a group are very aware that this tour is a privilege and do not take that for granted, but this trip is not just for us to say we went around the world. This trip is our way of giving back to students, the Berklee community, and the Pitch Slapped members before us. This is our way of proving that we have come so far because of the love and support we have received for the past 10 years, and to show other clubs that it is possible to do what has never been done before. Yes, there are risks taking 14 college kids to China; teaching them to adapt to the Chinese culture, performing in front of a new crowd of people who probably don’t know who they are and may not like what they do, and returning to school and to work. But are these challenges worth going? Apparently, or else we wouldn’t be asking for your help! Pitch Slapped understands all of the potential risks of traveling to China,but they are ready and excited to share their music to the people of Xi’an and Beijing!  Pitch Slapped’s overall goal is to bring our jazz-influenced, contemporary A Cappella music to new places and new heights. Share what qualifies you to overcome these hurdles.Describe your plan for solving these challenges.Other Ways You Can HelpIf you are not able to contribute to this Indiegogo, that is perfectly fine!

<h3>Bishop Lake : The Story!</h3>
<p>In 2011 Bishop Lake was founded by vocalist Zane as a studio project, releasing a 4 song EP in 2012.</p>
<p>In 2013 Bishop Lake added guitarist David Prince and began writing new music, later that year they enlisted drummer Scott Prian to drum for live gigs which extended into Scott producing their first full length album "" The Meritocracy of Hell"". ""Meritocracy"" was released Halloween night of 2014.</p>
<p>After several successful live shows in 2015 (with drummer Joey Stewart), they enlisted Dave Jackson to pound the skins for 2016 and to write new music. Later in 2016 saw the addition of Sam Abernathy (Uberstout) on guitar alongside David Prince. This leads us to now, the imminent release of ""When Lucifer Fell""!</p>
<p>Far from being a mere studio project, this album contains the collective vision of all members in order to bring you the best dark heavy metal rock and roll album of 2017. If you are a fan of Danzig, Ozzy era Black Sabbath, Volbeat or Ghost, then Bishop Lake is the band for you!</p>
<p>We have worked incredibly hard to write the best music we can, and we know this release will become part of your music rotation for years to come. Support indie rock! Support Bishop Lake and make metal great again!</p>

<h3>Hello Everyone</h3>
<p>Contributors fund ideas they can be passionate about and to people they trust. Here are some things to do in this section:</p>
<ul><li>Jacob Martin formed in early 2011 in Nashville,Tennessee through the underestimated power of Craigslist. Converging from all parts of the country, Jacob Martin (vocals/rhythm guitar), Josh Carlson (drums/background vocals), Mike Guy (bass/background vocals), and Jeff Coggins (lead guitar) came together to form a powerful, melodic band that captivates both country and rock listeners.</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<ul>

Jacob Martin formed in early 2011 in Nashville,Tennessee through the underestimated power of Craigslist. Converging from all parts of the country, Jacob Martin (vocals/rhythm guitar), Josh Carlson (drums/background vocals), Mike Guy (bass/background vocals), and Jeff Coggins (lead guitar) came together to form a powerful, melodic band that captivates both country and rock listeners.

<h3>The Graveface Museum </h3>
<p>The Graveface Museum is a labor of love and an ode to all things odd. I (Ryan Graveface) moved to Savannah in 2010 and opened Graveface Records &amp; Curiosities in the Starland District in 2011. I also moved my independent record label operation and have started two more labels since being here. I've been collecting morbid historical artifacts, horror sci-fi pinballs, death row artwork from infamous criminals and more basically all of my life. It's always been a dream of mine to have a means of sharing my collection publicly and I couldn't imagine a more perfect city to do this in. </p>
<p>When I first moved to Savannah the city was genuinely weird. It felt like one of the last remaining authentically strange places in the country which is part of what drew me in. One of the main reasons I left Chicago was to escape the rampant gentrification of unique neighborhoods that I cherished; unfortunately, Savannah is heading down a similar road. The city I adore is losing its character and charming grit to craft cocktails and overpriced food popping up on every corner. My goal with the museum is larger than putting interesting oddities on display; it's to offer something deeper and more impactful than what's currently being offered in the city. My hope with the museum is to get people talking or at least thinking about larger topics like morality, life, death, problems we still face with the criminal justice system, experiencing things of the past, and appreciating history to help reflect on today's culture. Or you can just go look at cool stuff and play spooky pinball. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><strong>The barebones: $18,500</strong><br/>There are many expenses when you're trying to build a museum out of a giant, historic warehouse. The barebones goal is what we need to completely finish the build-out. The goal with this build-out is to actually keep the aesthetic and all the original components of the building; we're fixing several components to make sure it's safe and installing a few things to appease the city. </p>
<p><strong>Outfitting and Displays: $29,000</strong><br/>So once the build-out is done all the fun stuff can start going into homes but wait-- what homes? This next goal will go toward building displays, framing artwork, and overall preparing to open and ensuring the experience is as next level as possible. </p>
<p><strong>Opening: $47,500</strong><br/>The overall goal is $47,500 to open the museum. </p>
<p>We are trying to open the museum on/around Halloween and with your help, we can make it happen. If the goal is not met whatever funds are raised will still go toward the eventual opening of the museum.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Savannah is known as being ""America's Most Haunted City."" Personally, I find this to be a joke. That phrase was created by the ghost tour industry in conjunction with the board of tourism as a means of getting people here. And golly gee it has worked. I'm sure they didn't realize 30 years ago the city would be completely different in 2019 and thus, not feel even remotely spooky in most parts of the city anymore. That being said I feel it's totally salvageable and we hope to make a MASSIVE impact in regards to all of this with the museum. The Graveface Museum will have authentically spooky stuff (not fake scary garbage the tourist industry sells) presented in an artistic and fun way WITH context. This will NOT be gory for the sake of gory.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you're broke as a joke but want to help please consider sharing this campaign, listen to the bands we release records of, listen to the soundtracks we release, come into the shop, spread the word. There are people that come to the shop daily that ask how long we've been around. When I say almost a decade they seem shocked. ""How could I have not heard about you sooner?"" </p>
<p>Word of mouth is everything to me. I cannot afford to advertise. Also, follow us and the museum on social media. Those numbers DO oddly help somehow. </p>

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><h3>Hi and thank you for being here!</h3><p>Welcome to the crowdfunding campaign for my debut album Lion of Love. My name is Carl Jonas and I’m a Swedish singer songwriter. Music has always been a part of my life, but it wasn’t until I had a spiritual awakening in 2007 that I realized that it was truly my purpose. It was literally like the flipping of a coin where I from one day til the next started to write songs in a way I had never done before.</p><p> </p><p>I didn't imagine at the time that it would take more than a decade before I would be ready to fully embody this purpose. However it wasn't until last summer that I wrote the song Lion of Love which turned out to be the key that finally enabled me to embody it. That song established a leap in my ability to both express and personally embody the realisation that broke through in 2007. Since then I’ve written a string of new songs that I’m so eager to share with the world. This album is therefor basically the flowering of the realisation that broke through around 13 years ago. If you choose to contribute to this campaign, you'll therefor help me manifest what I perceive to be the very purpose of my embodied existence.</p><p><br/>If you resonate with what I’ve been sharing and want to contribute to my campaign just choose the option that speaks to you and I will be so very grateful for your contribution. Cause you will not only help me generate and align all the aspects needed for recording and spreading my music in the best way possible. You’ll also help me show my inner skeptic that the way of the heart works beautifully as long as I follow it. Another great way to show your support is to share this message wherever you believe it will be appreciated and valued.</p><h3>
<br/>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p>As an emerging and independently empowered artist I rely fully on receiving backing from people that wants to support me. That makes crowd funding a true blessing, cause it enables me to reach out to you and ask for your support. At this stage there are a lot of things that need to be put into place. Apart from the cost for renting a studio, hiring a producer and musicians, there are costs for mastering, artwork, distribution, homepage, campaign gifts, travel expenses. Basically all of these costs can be modified to match an existing budget. However the more funds at my disposal the more resources can be deployed in each step of the project resulting in a greater end result.</p><p> </p><p>If you choose to contribute to my campaign you're not only helping me realize my greatest dream. You're also actively making a difference in this world by being part of a community based, co-creative event with the only motive to manifest and spread this music. Being funded this way also gives me a greater freedom to stay true to the vision of my heart without the need to compromise, which is very very valuable.</p><p> </p><p>If there are any specific perks that you wish to see being offered, please let me know and I will do what I can to make it available. But honestly I believe that the biggest take away for contributing to my campaign is the fact that you will be part of manifesting these songs so that you can both enjoy them for yourself, help me realise my greatest wish as well as making them available to the rest of the world.</p><p> </p><h3>The Impact</h3><p>This album is about embodied self-realization. It’s arising in response to a desire to nourish this realization to unfold where ever it is ready to unfold. By choosing to contribute to this campaign you will therefor not only help me realize my highest wish, to get my music out into the world. You will also play an active part in a co-creation that I believe will be a contribution to the shift in human consciousness that is indicative of our times. For the last 13 years I have, on and off, done my best to share this realization with people by mainly using dialog. My experience is that when I perform these new songs my ability to get people into the vibrational reality of this realization is greatly enhanced compared to when I use dialog alone. And this has barely started</p><h3>
<br/>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3><p>The most prominent challenge is to gather the right team. Apart from myself the most important person for this team is a producer that has the knowledge, the experience and the ability to generate the vision into a well crafted creation. Of course I have my eyes and ears open in every direction and I believe that this campaign may function as a platform from which I can reach and connect with the right people. If you happen to have any ideas or leads for me to check up please let me know.</p><h3>
<br/>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p>Lastly, if you feel that you want to help but don’t have the resources to make a contribution it’s always highly appreciated if you share this campaign where ever you believe it will be appreciated and valued. Either by using the Indiegogo share tools, or what ever works best for you.

If you choose to contribute to this campaign, you'll therefor help me manifest what I perceive to be the very purpose of my embodied existence.If you resonate with what I’ve been sharing and want to contribute to my campaign just choose the option that speaks to you and I will be so very grateful for your contribution. Cause you will not only help me generate and align all the aspects needed for recording and spreading my music in the best way possible. You’ll also help me show my inner skeptic that the way of the heart works beautifully as long as I follow it. Another great way to show your support is to share this message wherever you believe it will be appreciated and valued.
What I Need & What You GetAs an emerging and independently empowered artist I rely fully on receiving backing from people that wants to support me. That makes crowd funding a true blessing, cause it enables me to reach out to you and ask for your support. At this stage there are a lot of things that need to be put into place. Apart from the cost for renting a studio, hiring a producer and musicians, there are costs for mastering, artwork, distribution, homepage, campaign gifts, travel expenses. Basically all of these costs can be modified to match an existing budget. However the more funds at my disposal the more resources can be deployed in each step of the project resulting in a greater end result. If you choose to contribute to my campaign you're not only helping me realize my greatest dream. You're also actively making a difference in this world by being part of a community based, co-creative event with the only motive to manifest and spread this music. Being funded this way also gives me a greater freedom to stay true to the vision of my heart without the need to compromise, which is very very valuable. If there are any specific perks that you wish to see being offered, please let me know and I will do what I can to make it available. But honestly I believe that the biggest take away for contributing to my campaign is the fact that you will be part of manifesting these songs so that you can both enjoy them for yourself, help me realise my greatest wish as well as making them available to the rest of the world. The ImpactThis album is about embodied self-realization. It’s arising in response to a desire to nourish this realization to unfold where ever it is ready to unfold. By choosing to contribute to this campaign you will therefor not only help me realize my highest wish, to get my music out into the world. You will also play an active part in a co-creation that I believe will be a contribution to the shift in human consciousness that is indicative of our times. For the last 13 years I have, on and off, done my best to share this realization with people by mainly using dialog. My experience is that when I perform these new songs my ability to get people into the vibrational reality of this realization is greatly enhanced compared to when I use dialog alone. And this has barely started
Risks & ChallengesThe most prominent challenge is to gather the right team. Apart from myself the most important person for this team is a producer that has the knowledge, the experience and the ability to generate the vision into a well crafted creation. Of course I have my eyes and ears open in every direction and I believe that this campaign may function as a platform from which I can reach and connect with the right people. If you happen to have any ideas or leads for me to check up please let me know.
Other Ways You Can HelpLastly, if you feel that you want to help but don’t have the resources to make a contribution it’s always highly appreciated if you share this campaign where ever you believe it will be appreciated and valued. Either by using the Indiegogo share tools, or what ever works best for you. Thank you so much for your time!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>I'm a guy who grew up in the quiet corner of Connecticut who loves coffee, bacon, Jesus, Boston sports team, and my family. Not always in that order. I chase two young kids around at home and herd about fifteen rogue teenagers in my youth group. I drive all over New England for my day job and down to St. Paul's in Brookfield to lead music. </p>
<p>I've been playing music since 4th grade. I started out playing horn in the school band, but always wanted to learn to play guitar. One summer while in high school, my dad surprised me with a guitar as a birthday present and I started teaching myself how to play. Within a few weeks I was helping to lead music at church and I've felt called to do that ever since.</p>
<p>About eight years ago I began writing some of my own music for worship. Once I felt I had something worth sharing, I began playing my song at the church where I currently serve as a worship leader. It turned out that people actually connected with it and that encouraged me to keep writing. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1507934732/iririj8lsinvtrjv3mrr.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<p>Over the next couple of years I continued to write songs, and slowly introduced them to my church. Soon after, I began seeking out opportunities to share my music, but kept running into road blocks. It seemed like my music wasn't meant to go anywhere outside my home church.</p>
<p>From time to time, someone at church would ask me about one of my songs and where they could find it to listen to again. Sadly, the songs didn't 'exist' outside of our Sunday morning services. It made me think that maybe I should write more songs and try to record an album. </p>
<p>But it was during this time that my family went through a difficult season with the loss of two pregnancies.  I nearly gave up writing music. It was difficult to continue to write songs of praise when it was the last thing I felt like doing. It was a long struggle to get back to a place where I wanted to write songs again.</p>
<p>Then God's light broke into my darkness and I decided it was time to get back into songwriting. I dusted off some old ideas and even signed up for a songwriter's retreat. It was there that I met the guys from the band Brothers McClurg. I had to opportunity to get fresh ears on my songs and it inspired me to begin writing again.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, I had several people ask me again about my songs, all within a matter of a few weeks. My wife suggested that maybe it was God trying to tell me something. I didn't believe it.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1508185796/coewtpds5mhczncupvtc.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<p> </p>
<p>Eventually, God broke through my stubbornness and a plan began to come together for recording my songs. Chris and Anthony from Brothers McClurg have a studio up in Batavia, NY called Old Bear Studio. I'll be partnering with them on this project. They're going to help me finish up the songs for the EP, produce &amp; record the album. I can't wait to get to work with them.</p>
<p>The studio is a little outside Buffalo, NY and I'm headed there at the end of January to spend a week recording the album. After that, the good folks at Old Bear will work their magic and send me the completed songs. From there I'll be making the CD's and getting ready to release the album in May 2018.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Getting a project like this going is a lot of work, and costs a bit of money. I'm looking to raise $8500. The funding from this campaign will go towards the cost of producing, recording, &amp; mastering the album. There are travel expenses to the studio in Batavia, NY, costs involved with producing the actual CD, plus some administrative costs involved in producing the album and running this campaign. Finally, there are some costs in making the album available for purchase. </p>
<p>I've put together a number of different ways you can support the album - from a basic pre-order of the EP, either in digital form or a physical CD, to getting some personalized memorabilia or a t-shirt. There will be an album premiere concert next May, you can have me write a song just for you, or I can come lead worship at your church or home event. Check out all the perks listed on the right hand side of this page.</p>
<p>You might be concerned with what will happen if you contribute and the project isn't fully funded, which is completely understandable. I believe that I am answering a clear call that God has placed in front of me and I trust that He will find a way to make this happen. I plan to see this project through to the end. If I'm not 100% funded at the end of the campaign, I'll continue to move forward as far as I can. It might take longer than I plan right now, but I do believe by God's grace that this project will get completed one way or another.</p>

</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>These are songs that I lead at my church regularly; songs that people in my church use to worship and connect with God. I've also been asked by folks outside my faith community about using these songs in their churches. I want to equip my congregation, and others around me, to have these songs to take with them to worship our Savior throughout their week.  With your support of this project, I'll be able to finally put these songs into a form that can be used by others - and who knows what plans God has for this project beyond that.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>This project is my top priority - right after my wife, my kids, my full time job, my job as a worship leader, and my job as a youth leader. There's a lot to accomplish over the next few months and many challenges ahead, but I have a great team supporting me on this project, mainly my amazing wife and kids. I also have those at my home church, St. Paul's in Brookfield and others within my community who are backing me with their prayer and support throughout this project. </p>
<p>The studio time is booked and the concert date is set. I will be faithful to the call given to me and get the job done. I know that with your support, both financial and in prayer, that this album will be completed for God's glory.</p>

<h2>Joshua's first LIVE ALBUM in almost 10 years at the Tower of David, Jerusalem</h2>
<p>2009 is when it all began for me. It was the year I was moving to Israel. My dream was to move to my mother's home country (my inheritance!)and be a light unto my people. I knew MUSIC was my tool so we recorded a very low-budget live album, called ""Bo Yeshua"". That's what started it all! Now over 9 years later, 4 studio albums later and with over 30 MILLION YouTube views on our page... it's time to do a LIVE album again. THIS TIME in the old city of Jerusalem!</p>
<p>Although three years ago I began a great relationship as a songwriter with integrity music, I'm still an<strong> independent artist</strong>. That means, I still don't have a record company to back this album. BUT WAIT, I have you! I've always had you. In fact almost every one of my albums have been crowdfunded right here on Indiegogo. But this is the biggest project we've ever done. </p>
<p><strong>WE NEED YOUR HELP!</strong> This event is the first of its kind. To our knowledge, never has a Messianic-Jewish gathering like this happened before within the Old City Walls! Imagine folks from all over the country and the world coming to the <strong>City of David worshiping</strong> in one accord. Sounds pretty biblical to me! I know this is the year, and time to hold this event and I thank you for helping us accomplish such a holy, for-such-a-time-as-this event. </p>
<p>Please note, contributions are not tax deductible. Thank you for investing in us and helping reach across the world from Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Praise awaits you, our God, in Zion; to you our vows will be fulfilled. Psalm 65:1 </p>
<p>He put a new song in my mouth, a song of praise to our God; Many will see and fear and will trust in the Lord. Psalm 40:3 </p>
<h3>You Can Help Us Hit Level 3</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Level 1: $100,000</strong> Funds the full live video &amp; audio production, budget for the full band, helps us fly in our artists, to rent/purchase the best equipment and helps us turn the City of David (and the old city) into a House of Worship! </li>
<li>
<strong>Level 2: $120,000</strong> Allows us to hire the best audio and video engineers/producers to take this live album to Disc, DVD &amp; YouTube to share with the world! Helps print our first run of discs &amp; DVD's. </li>
<li>
<strong>Level 3: $150,000</strong> This is reaching high! BUT we'll be recording a shabbat album next spring and will not be crowd-funding again. *IF our funds exceed our Level 2 goal during these fall feasts, all addition funds will be directed to complete the classic ""Shabbat Album"" featuring my sweet Messianic Singer friends from Israel and the nations. </li>

<h3>A little bit about me...</h3>
<p>I'm a solo acoustic blues/roots artist from Melbourne, Australia. I've been playing guitar for 27 years, and have also been singing &amp; writing songs for 20 years. During this time, I've recorded &amp; released 8 albums, played thousands of shows all over the world, and have been fortunate enough work with some incredible producers, engineers &amp; musicians over the course of my recording career. In addition to this, I've also been fortunate enough to do some extra cool things like open up for &amp; sing with The Doobie Brothers, and win the Singer/Songwriter Of The Year title at the most recent Australian Independent Music Awards.</p>
<p>I'm extremely pleased to be working on my next studio album, which will be followed by a 20-date national release tour covering metro &amp; regional centres all over Australia. For this project, I will be making every effort possible to push the creative envelope further than I've ever done before as an artist. As the things that inspire me the most at the moment is the attempt of creating some completely new &amp; innovative sounds for modern-day blues/roots music, and also the acoustic guitar in general.</p>
<p>Yes, I'm fully aware that these ambitions are incredibly lofty, so therefore I am asking for your help to assist me with bringing these ultimate visions to life.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I am looking to raise $20,000 all up from this campaign, which will go towards the costs of making the album to the absolute best of my ability, and also taking it on the road around the country to present it in a live setting. This will equate to around half of the total desired expenditure, as I am planning on covering the rest of these costs myself.</p>
<p>Here's a breakdown of estimated costs-</p>
<p>Recording/Mixing-$8,000</p>
<p>Session Musician Fees-$2,000</p>
<p>Mastering-$1,500</p>
<p>Artwork/Graphic Design-$1,000</p>
<p>CD Pressing x 1000 Units-$1,800</p>
<p>Limited Edition 12-inch Vinyl Pressing x 100 Units-$3,000</p>
<p>Music Videos x 3 Singles - $3,000</p>
<p>T-Shirt Printing x 100 Units-$2,000</p>
<p>Album Release/Tour Publicity-$8,000</p>
<p>Tour Travel Costs-$4,000</p>
<p>Digital Marketing(Spotify/Apple Music etc)-$5,000</p>
<p>TOTAL ESTIMATED EXPENDITURE - $39,300</p>
<p>If I can achieve this target, I'll be able to deliver all of these things to the highest level of quality possible. However if I do fall short with hitting it, I'll still do my absolute best to deliver as many of these things as feasibly possible.</p>
<p>And now to the fun stuff, what are you gonna get? I've thought long &amp; hard about the types of rewards I could include as part of this campaign, and have even asked many of my existing fans already about the types of things they would like to receive. So I'll be including a wide range of things like digital downloads, signed CD's, signed vinyl, signed T-Shirts, house concerts, intimate dinner table performances, guitar/singing lessons, in-depth music career consultations(for aspiring artists/musicians), studio session sit-ins, your name in the album artwork liner notes, live video performances of your favorite song, me writing &amp; recording a song just for you(preferably with your lyrics), handwritten signed lyric sheets, golden ticket(which gives lifetime free entry to any/every show anywhere in the world), and last but not least, I am EVEN offering to shave off my beard(this is at extreme resistance &amp; reluctance...).</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As an artist, it has always been of upmost importance to me to attempt the practice of presenting records &amp; live shows that are deeply engaging, emotional, passionate, inspiring, thought-provoking &amp; ground-breaking for listeners/receivers. I certainly don't think I'm anywhere near close to achieving my full potential with any of this, but with this particular project, I will make every endeavor possible to bring this vision one step closer to life in a way that I've never done before.</p>
<p>Naturally, breaking new ground in the blues/roots genre and also with how the acoustic guitar can sound &amp; be played is extremely important to me. It'll never be up to me to decide if I achieve this or not, however with your assistance on this project, I truly feel that I'll have the greatest possible chance of realising this vision &amp; sharing it with as many folks throughout the world as possible.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Beyond the obvious financial challenges with making a record of this magnitude, the greatest risk with this project I face from a creative/musical perspective is to create something that is too grandiose &amp; lacks musical direction &amp; purpose. This often happens when artists attempt to break new ground with genre-bending ideas etc. It's an incredibly challenging undertaking to make bold &amp; new statements in music, especially in genres that have been around for long periods of time, and where there's the obvious thought process of ""it's all been done before"". I am of the belief that with my experience, passion, tenacity &amp; great interest in musical growth &amp; diversity, I'll be able to overcome this challenge.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you are unable to contribute to this campaign financially by purchasing one of the many rewards, all good! One way you can help is by spreading the word about this campaign with shares on your social networks, and telling a few of your friends about it that might be at all interested. Of course I'll appreciate any type of assistance possible in relation to getting the word out about this campaign!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Muddy High Heels Entertainment, Inc., is a non-profit company founded by a talented singer/songwriter and the author of the book, <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Muddy-High-Heels-Breakdown-Breakthrough/dp/1500924792/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=muddy+high+heels&amp;qid=1599177915&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Muddy High Heels: 14 Lessons Learned from my Breakdown, Breakup, and Breakthrough</a>. The purpose of this company is to produce performances that cleanse the soul of all women who have experienced abuse at the hands of a male. The performers are low-income, Black, single moms who have experienced physical, emotional, verbal, sexual, financial, and spiritual abuse but no longer want to be defined by it. When the founder dealt with the abuse she experienced as an adolescent, she felt compelled to share with other women how she found healing. The songs these performers share will inspire healing and self-confidence in all women across the globe who also have experienced abuse at the hands of a male. The music video that is produced from the funds of this campaign will help mothers find the internal strength to take back their power, capture resilience, and redefine their worth. With funding from contributors, MHHE will (1) coach and mentor the performers; (2) teach them how to monetize for wealth creation; and, (3) produce a music video for purchase.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need funding at the level of $13,000. These funds will be used to create and produce our first music video of the six (6) performers we coach, mentor, and train. The song for the music video is an original, <a href=""https://itun.es/us/aDfz9"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Woman of Destiny</a> (available on itunes), that the Executive Director of this non-profit co-wrote and recorded the lead vocals back in 2001. Our performers will be ready to star in this music video after they are coached, mentored, and trained. Exclusive to contributors, they get to: (1) attend the viewing parties of the music video before it goes public for purchase, (2) interact LIVE with the performers in a virtual Q&amp;A format; and (3) learn from our Grammy-nominated music producer how to express your soul through music.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Sigmund Freud said, “Unexpressed emotions will never die. They are buried alive and will come forth later in uglier ways.” </p>
<p>Every 9 seconds, a woman is assaulted. Yet, too often she keeps silent about the experience and internalizes her emotional pain. She “keeps it moving”, as they say. However, the experience creates ""ugliness"" like bitterness, haunting memories, and beliefs about not being good enough. These experiences weigh heavily on her psyche, making single motherhood as a low-income minority even harder. Your contribution offers her an outlet for self-expression, recognition that her pain is real, and that resilience is possible. Redirecting pain into productive expression opens an opportunity to be more successful as a woman, mother, employee, and community contributor.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Although the “Me Too” movement has given voice to abused women, admitting abuse remains a taboo, for many cultural, political, and practical reasons that are too numerous to name here. We recognize that just because we provide a platform for these moms to transform pain into resilience, they may remain silent and in the shadows. This is why the Executive Director will lead with her personal story and the music that she has already written and recorded. She will provide a safe place for these moms to share. We also recognize that we may be looking for a needle in the haystack: low-income, Black, single moms who have talent AND who are willing to be coached, mentored, and trained by us. While we recognize this challenge, we are prepared to look far and wide for her. Our pilot group is a minimum of six moms and a maximum of 8. We are confident that we can identify a sufficient number of prospects from the greater Philadelphia, PA region to yield 6-8 ideal performers.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Financial contributions will help us produce a music video that can ""cleanse"" the soul of women who have experienced abuse. However, financial contributions are not the only way for contributors to help. Other ways are: (1) share our purpose with women you know who could benefit from what we offer; (2) become a member of the Muddy High Heels Entertainment Family; (3) use the Indiegogo share tools.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
</div></div>","Short Summary
Muddy High Heels Entertainment, Inc., is a non-profit company founded by a talented singer/songwriter and the author of the book, Muddy High Heels: 14 Lessons Learned from my Breakdown, Breakup, and Breakthrough. The purpose of this company is to produce performances that cleanse the soul of all women who have experienced abuse at the hands of a male. The performers are low-income, Black, single moms who have experienced physical, emotional, verbal, sexual, financial, and spiritual abuse but no longer want to be defined by it. When the founder dealt with the abuse she experienced as an adolescent, she felt compelled to share with other women how she found healing. The songs these performers share will inspire healing and self-confidence in all women across the globe who also have experienced abuse at the hands of a male. The music video that is produced from the funds of this campaign will help mothers find the internal strength to take back their power, capture resilience, and redefine their worth. With funding from contributors, MHHE will (1) coach and mentor the performers; (2) teach them how to monetize for wealth creation; and, (3) produce a music video for purchase.

What We Need & What You Get
We need funding at the level of $13,000. These funds will be used to create and produce our first music video of the six (6) performers we coach, mentor, and train. The song for the music video is an original, Woman of Destiny (available on itunes), that the Executive Director of this non-profit co-wrote and recorded the lead vocals back in 2001. Our performers will be ready to star in this music video after they are coached, mentored, and trained. Exclusive to contributors, they get to: (1) attend the viewing parties of the music video before it goes public for purchase, (2) interact LIVE with the performers in a virtual Q&A format; and (3) learn from our Grammy-nominated music producer how to express your soul through music.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I’m Asher Saiz and this campaign has been created to help fund my first album. I’m an indie alternative musician/ artist. Recently, I released a demo quality cut of my first single, The Traveller.  After it received positive reception, I knew I was on the right track and decided to move forward with recording an album. Many of the songs featured in this cardinal project mean very much and have been waiting to see the light of day. By contributing to this campaign, you’ll not only fund my very first album - you’ll also be investing into me as a recording artist and helping me establish myself as an independent musician.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Right now, where things stand, I’m looking at approximately $1,000 in recording expenses. Base studio costs are currently $500 (approximately three days in the studio). The other $500 would be used for related expenses from potentially including extra studio time to having a limited amount of hard copies of the album being made and shipped. Part of why I created this campaign as opposed to a Go Fund Me is because I want you, the investor, to have a return on your investment!</p>
<p>Everyone who invests a minimum of $10 will get a digital copy of the album upon completion, 1 week prior to the official release date of 12/29/2020. Other perks include signed hard copies of the album and live, private performance of the album! Whether the fundraising goal isn’t met or is completely surpassed, all funds will go to the funding of the album and all related expenses.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>If you’ve heard my single, The Traveller, and thought it was good, then imagine how much better this will be. The Traveller didn’t have a budget - meaning $0 went into it. No studio. No nothing. With your help, I can really polish The Traveller and the other songs going into this project. 7 songs. 7 moments. 1 story. Something as small as having an engineer present when you’re recording can help traverse the fine line between a successful and unsuccessful project.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest risk being faced right now will be ensuring the tracking process is completed within the initial timeframe planned for. I don’t doubt that recording can be done in 2-3 days. I will take it upon myself to ensure I am adequately prepared for each day in the studio to really make the most of my time. The goal is to track for 2-3 songs per day. By following this estimate, the likelihood that I will need extra recording time is minimal</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I understand if you cannot fincancially invest into my project and respect that. These are difficult times. But! There are other ways you can help ^__^</p>
<p>You can follow me on all social media platforms @ashersaiz; and share them so your friends can follow, too! Subscribe to my YouTube channel and follow along with the project’s process in my soon to come vlog, Asher Saiz: The Road to The Album. Lastly, you can share this campaign with your friends.

<h3>10 Reasons why the world needs Jeeni</h3>
<p>My name is Mel Croucher. I'm a record producer and computer nerd, and over the years I've worked with a whole bunch of superstars like Prince, Frank Zappa and Eminem, to build smart databases and sell stuff direct to fans. In other words, I've been around successful musicians all my working life.</p>
<p>A few years back I was hearing from more and more artists how unhappy they were with the big streaming services. That's the reason I polled 4,200 of them via social networks about their Top-Ten Problems with Spotify, Apple Music, Soundcloud, Deezer, and the rest. The poll result was a shocker! So I asked a bunch of the best brains in the music business to help me create an ethical alternative. It's taken us two years, and we call our alternative JEENI.</p>
<p>Here's what the artists we polled told us, and here's our Jeeni solution to their problems.</p>
<p><strong>1 - Money.</strong> <i>Artists get paid a pittance. Platforms like YouTube pay $0.00069 per view, so even 10,000 views earns us less than the cost of a pizza per month.</i><br/><strong>Jeeni solution.</strong> OK, we get it. You do all the hard work, so you deserve all the rewards. How about a Jeeni deal where you to keep 100% of all music sales, ticketing, and merchandise sold through our platform.</p>
<p><strong>2 - Recognition.</strong> <i>We try really hard, but streaming platforms just don't get us more fans or recognition. </i><br/><strong>Jeeni solution.</strong> Right. Let's make Jeeni an artist development platform. Our founder invented viral marketing in 1994. Then he achieved the world's first million-user viral campaign. Now he's designed all the tools you need to grow your fanbase and get recognition: all part of the Jeeni service.</p>
<p><strong>3 - Communication.</strong> <i>We don't know the identity of who's streaming our stuff, so we can't get in direct contact with anyone who wants to know more about us.</i><br/><strong>Jeeni solution. </strong>OK. Here's the deal. With Jeeni you get a built-in fan database to contact everyone who votes for you or likes your work, and you communicate direct with them as often as you like. Safely, legally and all opt-in.</p>
<p><strong>4 - B*llsh*t.</strong> <i>The big streaming platforms are full of it. We hate the adverts, we hate the artificial likes, we hate the paid-for recommendations, we hate the hype.</i><br/><strong>Jeeni solution.</strong> The answer to this is an ethical alternative. We guarantee that Jeeni will stay advert-free. We pledge our charts are the result of democratic votes by real people. And we promise that all Jeeni content comes from genuine unpaid sources. Oh yeah, we'll also pay our taxes in full, because we believe we should make a positive contribution to the society we live in.</p>
<p><strong>5 - Rip Offs.</strong> <i>We just can't break through, and even when we think we're making progress as artists we get ripped off.</i><br/><strong>Jeeni solution. </strong>Yep. The entertainment business has always been full of shysters. Let's be honest here, the people behind Jeeni have all made it to the top somehow, and between us we've made every mistake in the book. Our mission is to help you achieve success and avoid the rip-offs. That's why our Jeeni Mentors, Ambassadors and Masterclasses have joined forces to do exactly that.</p>
<p><strong>6 - Choice.</strong> <i>The big streaming services all offer similar content, dominated by the same big star names. </i><br/><strong>Jeeni solution.</strong> Agreed, so let's ignore the content everyone else uses and leave our competitors to fight it out! Jeeni is designed for undiscovered artists to break through, based on talent alone, not ad-spend.</p>
<p><strong>7 - Channels. </strong><i>My work doesn't fit into mainstream channels. For example, what about channels for spoken-word?</i><br/><strong>Jeeni solution. </strong>No problem. Jeeni already has dedicated spoken-word channels for poetry, comedy, and voice actors, plus channels for entertainments ranging from dance to videogame soundtracks. And if we don't already have a channel that suits your need ... we'll sit down and create it!</p>
<p><strong>8 - Visibility.</strong><i> People either don't know about our work, or can't find it even if they do. </i><br/><strong>Jeeni solution.</strong> We've designed the smartest user interface we can. On Jeeni, you can search by name, type of channel, instrumentation, latest uploads, popularity, even by influences and heroes. But above all, our artists have complete control over publicising their own announcements to their specific Jeeni audience.</p>
<p><strong>9 - Fakes.</strong> <i>What's the difference between the Jeeni Awards and the fake results dominated by celebrity voting?</i><br/><strong>Jeeni solution. </strong>Simple. Jeeni doesn't have celebrity voting. Our Awards will always be based on one member - one vote. No ifs, no buts.</p>
<p><strong>10 - Live performance.</strong> <i>I'd like to stream an event, and charge people to watch it. Can Jeeni do that?</i><br/><strong>Jeeni solution. </strong>Um, not yet, but we're working on it! Come on now, we're not perfect, so we need your help. Please read on ...<br/> </p>

Agreed, so let's ignore the content everyone else uses and leave our competitors to fight it out! Jeeni is designed for undiscovered artists to break through, based on talent alone, not ad-spend.
7 - Channels. My work doesn't fit into mainstream channels. For example, what about channels for spoken-word?Jeeni solution. No problem. Jeeni already has dedicated spoken-word channels for poetry, comedy, and voice actors, plus channels for entertainments ranging from dance to videogame soundtracks. And if we don't already have a channel that suits your need ... we'll sit down and create it!
8 - Visibility. People either don't know about our work, or can't find it even if they do. Jeeni solution. We've designed the smartest user interface we can. On Jeeni, you can search by name, type of channel, instrumentation, latest uploads, popularity, even by influences and heroes. But above all, our artists have complete control over publicising their own announcements to their specific Jeeni audience.
9 - Fakes. What's the difference between the Jeeni Awards and the fake results dominated by celebrity voting?Jeeni solution. Simple. Jeeni doesn't have celebrity voting. Our Awards will always be based on one member - one vote. No ifs, no buts.
10 - Live performance. I'd like to stream an event, and charge people to watch it. Can Jeeni do that?Jeeni solution. Um, not yet, but we're working on it! Come on now, we're not perfect, so we need your help. Please read on ... 

What We Need

All the hard work has been done. Our support networks are in place. Jeeni is up and running. Now we need your help, your feedback, your votes, your talent and your videos, as we scale up globally. And if you're not an artist yourself, then you can gift a Jeeni membership to anyone you like.
We need to ramp up the funding for our hosting servers and bandwidth as we grow, and above all we need to fund the cost of outreach to new fans on behalf of Jeeni artists.
Our funding goals are really simple. Our user acquisition cost is around £0.18, so for every £5,000 we raise, we grow our fan capacity by around 28,000 - directly targeting audiences from festivals, clubs, educational centres and our huge network of existing fan-bases and partnerships.

<h2>Flo Chase and the making of 'Toi'</h2>
<p>Flo Chase is an indie pop singer-songwriter inspired by the striking sounds of Sufjan Stevens and Bon Iver, born to French parents and raised mostly in Australia before making the trek to Los Angeles. Since the early age of seven when Chase started learning his first instrument - piano, he felt a connection with music right away. At 12, his family moved to Australia. Not knowing a single word of English, he fully immersed himself in music - a place he could find comfort and express himself. Shortly after, Chase started taking vocal lessons and learning composition, and soon later taught himself to play drums, banjo, harmonica, bass and ukulele. From then, the multi-instrumentalist was all in. </p>
<p>Chase, now living in Los Angeles, has created a record reflecting that experience of leaving his home, family and friends to start fresh and embrace the unknown. His debut album titled Toi is symbolic of the solitude and feelings that came with saying goodbye and pursuing his dream.</p>
<p>“I feel listeners will still find a ground of resonance from my first EP Le Debut, however this new record feels even more personal to me for multiple reasons,” he says. “Over the years, I believe I have grown as an artist and man in general while the experience of moving to Los Angeles and re-adapting to a new culture and way of life has definitely allowed me to dig deeper into my feelings.”</p>
<p>“I hope my fans will find some sense of relatedness, comfort and cheerfulness in this new record,” says Chase. ""I hope it will be one of those records fans will turn to whenever they feel the urge to escape the real world even if it’s for a minute, and also one they will smile and dance to.”</p>

<p>Why are there certain songs we return to again and again? Songs are connected to memories - painful, exhilarating, funny, terrifying, joyous memories. Music is the emotional marker that reminds us of “that time when” - sometimes it’s the medicine that gets us through, sometimes it’s the anthem we sang once we made it. There’s no feeling like the one when you hear the opening chords of a track that takes you back.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In the first iteration of THIS SONG REMINDS ME OF, I’m singing some of my fav emo songs from middle school and telling stories from that time in my life. For me, no genre holds more loaded stories than this one!! I promise it will be your inner emo kid’s greatest dream!!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It is my hope that by singing these songs and telling these stories - and in future iterations of this show, inviting my talented friends to do the same - we can all remember together, and we can all feel less alone. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Why do I need this initial funding? I have a kickass band and I believe in paying artists what they deserve! I also want to have enough money set aside to pay for extra equipment we may need, renting rehearsal space and covering any upfront venue costs. The idea is that eventually our band will require less rehearsal time and that with ticket sales the show will eventually pay for itself. But I need your help to get it off the ground!</p>

<p> </p>
<p>My name is Pauls Pokratnieks, and I am a drummer, composer and educator from Latvia.</p>
<p>Since I started to play music professionally I have had amazing opportunities to be part of so many great projects as a side-man and visit more than 20 countries. I love to make other people compositions alive and add my interpretation and experience to them. </p>
<p>In the last few years, I have started to compose more regularly and I find it so fulfilling to express myself through writing songs and lyrics. To share my own music with fellow musicians and audience gives me such satisfaction and meaning. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I want to document a period of my life, period like a rollercoaster - up and down, up and down. A period during which I was lost and in many ways still am, a period I lost my best friend, but also met so many new ones, a period in which I started to live my dream, but at the same time felt like dying.  The period during which I started to shape into new version as a human being, as a man, and as an artist. I think for the better, but who am I to say -  time will tell.</p>
<p>While living in Sweden I have met two truly amazing human beings who happen to be outstanding musicians as well - Swedish pianist <strong>Fabian Kallerdahl </strong>and Finish double bass player <strong>Olli Rantala</strong>.  They have helped me to make my compositions more than alive and I am so grateful to learn from them and grow as a band together. On the west coast of Sweden, we are known as <strong>""PULSE TRIO""</strong>. </p>

<p>I have paid 15.000 sek (1500 eur) from my savings already for the recording process in the beautiful Epidemin studio, but there are much more expenses to cover - </p>

<p>To make this album reality it would be amazing if YOU could support us and join us in this process. <strong>I am determined to finalize this project no matter if we reach our financial goal or not</strong>, but your contribution and support would mean so much to do it in the best possible way and to share with you high-quality products what you deserve. </p>

We would like to invite you to be part of the process of making our album reality and support us by choosing one of the 12 rewards/perks listed here. You can also donate any amount you can. Every bit counts! 
 
A bit longer story
Who? What? Why?

 
My name is Pauls Pokratnieks, and I am a drummer, composer and educator from Latvia.
Since I started to play music professionally I have had amazing opportunities to be part of so many great projects as a side-man and visit more than 20 countries. I love to make other people compositions alive and add my interpretation and experience to them. 
In the last few years, I have started to compose more regularly and I find it so fulfilling to express myself through writing songs and lyrics. To share my own music with fellow musicians and audience gives me such satisfaction and meaning. 
 
I want to document a period of my life, period like a rollercoaster - up and down, up and down. A period during which I was lost and in many ways still am, a period I lost my best friend, but also met so many new ones, a period in which I started to live my dream, but at the same time felt like dying.  The period during which I started to shape into new version as a human being, as a man, and as an artist. I think for the better, but who am I to say -  time will tell.
While living in Sweden I have met two truly amazing human beings who happen to be outstanding musicians as well - Swedish pianist Fabian Kallerdahl and Finish double bass player Olli Rantala.  They have helped me to make my compositions more than alive and I am so grateful to learn from them and grow as a band together. On the west coast of Sweden, we are known as ""PULSE TRIO"". 
 


 

 
I have composed music, through musical interactions we have made it awake and now we are ready to share our debut album ""THE END IS THE BEGINNING"" with YOU. 
 

Why I want YOU to be part of it?
 
I have paid 15.000 sek (1500 eur) from my savings already for the recording process in the beautiful Epidemin studio, but there are much more expenses to cover - 

mixing 
mastering
original cover artwork
creative photo session
print of CD's
print of LP's
print of the T-shirt's

All together future expenses make around 20.000 sek (2000 eur).
 
To make this album reality it would be amazing if YOU could support us and join us in this process. I am determined to finalize this project no matter if we reach our financial goal or not, but your contribution and support would mean so much to do it in the best possible way and to share with you high-quality products what you deserve. 
 
What do YOU get?
 
I deeply appreciate any support, be it a share, thumbs-up, donation or contribution, and in return I will give you:

A social shout-out and at every contribution level.
Early access to the album. 
Physical rewards such as CD's, LP's, T-Shirts.
A personalized composition, private lesson.
VIP experience during our concert.

 
Other ways YOU can help
 
If you for any reason can't join us for the journey to make this album or have other journeys to take part I would kindly ask you to share this campaign video with your friends on social media and beyond. I would appreciate that a lot and it can make the difference.

<h3>About our project:</h3>
<p>Hello Everyone!</p>
<p>We are <strong>Trio Resonance</strong>, comprised of Noé Garcia Jacinto, Zhi Li and Héctor Alfonso Torres González, a classical guitar trio based in the DFW area of North Texas. Since we started playing together in 2016, it was always one of our goals to eventually put out a recording that could represent our sound, ideas and experience, and after touring for 3 years, arranging multiple pieces and exploring different repertoire we finally have come up with a project which we believe in and are hoping that will be to the enjoyment of the public!</p>
<p>This album is a collection of carefully selected pieces which we feel represents us as artistically culturally and emotionally. From the subtle and beautiful melodies of the Chinese traditional landscape pieces to the moving and energetic tangos of Piazzolla and Maximo Diego Pujol, Sound and Motion represents our personal relationship between music, movement and resonance. Sound and Motion directly relates to the debut recording of The Art of Sound and Motion by New Zealand composer Bruce Paine. This is an incredibly unique and beautiful piece which was inspired by the kinetic sculptures from the Len Lye Centre in New Plymouth, New Zealand. As the composer explains, this piece ""explores a range of interesting and unusual classical guitar timbral effects entirely in keeping with the subject matter and likely to fascinate audiences."" </p>
<p>Here is our <strong>Track Listing</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fin de Siglo - Maximo Diego Pujol</li>
<li>O Trio Magico - Roland Dyens</li>
<li>Concertino no. 1 - Guido Santorsola</li>
<li>Mishima - Philip Glass (arr. Zhi Li)</li>
<li>Silver Clouds Chasing the Moon 0 - Guang Ren (arr. Zhi Li)</li>
<li>Spring Breeze - Yusian Deng (arr. Zhi Li)</li>
<li>Fuga y Misterio - Astor Piazzolla (arr. Héctor Alfonso Torres)</li>
<li>Oblivion - Astor Piazzolla (arr. Héctor Alfonso Torres)</li>
<li>The Art of Sound and Motion - Bruce Paine *debut recording **arr. for three guitars by Bruce Paine</li>

<p>We are extremely happy to be able to share this project and hope that it will catch your interest. Thanks so much for reading and for your time!</p>

<h3>About Us:</h3>
<p>Trio Resonance is a classical guitar trio comprised of Noé Garcia Jacinto, Li Zhi and Héctor Alfonso Torres González. They started playing together in 2016 while working as Teaching Fellows at the University of North Texas where they were studying towards their Doctor in Musical Arts degree.  From the very beginning they experienced an amazing and fufilling chemistry as a group and decided to explore the guitar trio repertoire, as well as arrange music that they felt could push their artistry and sound. </p>
<p>They have devoted themselves towards expanding the guitar trio repertoire by arranging works of great composers like Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Johann Sebastian Bach and Astor Piazzolla, also by playing new works written for guitar trio like the Second Brasileira Suite by composer Sergio Assad, Suite Seattle by Kevin Callahan and Fin de Siglo by Maximo Diego Pujol. Recently, they commissioned composer Bruce Paine to arrange for them his piece The Art of Sound and Motion, originally for guitar quartet, which they will make a recording debut in their upcoming album Sound and Motion. Their vision is to tap into the potential and expressiveness of the guitar trio ensemble in order to generate more ""resonance"" with their listeners. Apart from playing throughout the U.S, for the past three summers they have toured China playing in cities like Jinan, Suzhou, Dalian, Beijing, Guangzhou, Shenzhen and many others.</p>
<p>Apart from their active ensemble performing career, they have been top prize winners in many solo international guitar competitions, including Classical Minds (Houston), Southern Guitar Music Festival and Competition (South Carolina), Appalachian State Guitar Music Festival (North Carolina), Mountain View Classical Guitar Competition (Texas), Lone Star Guitar Festival (Texas), International Tennessee Guitar Festival (Tennessee), Baldwin Wallace International Guitar Festival and Competition (Ohio) and many others. They have also studied with many world-renowned artist including, Pepe Romero, Roland Dyens, Eliot Fisk, Zoran Dukic, Adam Holzman, Aniello Desiderio, Denis Azabagic, Rene Izquierdo, Marcin Dylla, the LAGQ and many others.</p>
<h3>Funding Breakdown:</h3>
<p>We are looking to raise $2500 which will help cover the following expense:</p>
<ul>
<li>Recording Engineer (Mixing, Editing, Mastering) <a href=""http://michaelsterlingsmith.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://michaelsterlingsmith.com/</a>
</li>
<li>Manufacturing (Printing)</li>
<li>Royalties, Licensing, Publishing</li>
<li>Shipping</li>
<li>Album Design</li>
<li>Merchandise</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<p>We are also planning on making some really cool merchandise, shirts and stickers to go with our campaign, these will be limited so we hope that as many of you grab them!!</p>
<p>Our album has already been recorded and mastered by our great friend and recording engineer Michael Smith, he did some fine work and we are eternally grateful for this! We started recording this album at the end of February and it was our original plan to finish early in March for a summer release, but as March came by COVID hit hard in Texas, and we had to delay the recording. Thankfully we got a super tight window to go into the studio for a couple of hours in June, right before Michael was moving out of state! </p>
<p>We have 30 days to reach our funding, if we fail to reach our goal it might slow down our production time but no matter what happens this album will eventually come out.</p>

<h3>The Wicc-id Woman (of Wexford)</h3>
<p>Over the past 12 months or so, I have  been feverishly spending weekends and every other free day in a rural house in Wexford, writing and recording what has developed into a double album suite of songs under the project name The Wicc. The name just sort of arrived on the back of these strange modern folk tales and murder ballads I started writing down there. That's Wexford for you. It's a modern folk murder ballad sort of place. That or it's me.</p>
<p>Anyway I am now at the point where I need a capital injection to get the project where it needs to go. Stuff is fully written and recorded to a certain standard but the limitations of my set-up are starting to grind and truth is it's just not going to sound as good as it could without some technical investment. Listed below is the gear that would do the business.</p>
<p>I'd love to get both albums out by February 2020, but at very least one of them (Lupercalia) will be released at that time with the other as yet untitled to follow within a short time frame and definitely also next year. Both albums together will comprise The Wolf Chronicles (Parts 1 and 2). Though I won't commit to it, there's always the possibility of a Part 3 birthing itself at a later time. In addition to recording, I've also started making my own short films/videos and I will be looking at setting up a subscription service (which will be free to you funders) to deliver other media and extra audio content.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Wicc-ar Basket</h3>
<p>I need:</p>
<ul>
<li>Full version audio software</li>
<li>New audio interface</li>
<li>Studio quality near-field monitors</li>
<li>A great mic (or two)</li>
<li>High quality orchestral samples</li>
<li>New plug-ins (production software add-ons)</li>
<li>Novation Bass Station</li>
<li>Stage electric keys (secondhand is fine)</li>
<li>Some gewgaws, accessories and things what none of this will work without</li>
<li>Mastering of the double album</li>
</ul>
<p>Last one is pretty important actually. Where some bobs can be saved on individual items of tech this is a cost that has to be met for me to deliver the goods that you're all paying for. So even though this is a flexible goal, I guess that means I'd need a bottom line of a few thousand even to release the material in its present condition (which I'd rather not do). </p>
<p>You get:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Digital download of Lupercalia for 10 euros</p></li>
<li><p>Digital download of Lupercalia and limited edition CD of same for 20 euros</p></li>
<li><p>Digital downloads of both Lupercalia and untitled second half of The Wolf Chronicles for 20 euros</p></li>
<li><p>Digital downloads of the above (parts 1 AND 2) as well as limited edition CDs of each for 40 euros</p></li>
<li><p>To support foreseeable future releases with anything additional you can donate</p></li>
<li><p>To be gratefully remembered by my eternal soul for all time (or at least until I lose my faculties) </p></li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Wicc-id Truth</h3>
<p>My experience of reward-making has been that additional ones beyond the work itself, even if handcrafted to save money, end up being cumbersome, time-consuming and ultimately distracting from the core purpose. So I want to keep it simple this time. I took the trouble to ask some friends and followers for their input on the rewards base. Most people were down with just the album itself and the opportunity to donate above and beyond the asking price. Some would prefer if the digital material was available from streaming platforms. My own instinct on that is to hold off on streaming availability until a more artist-friendly option comes along, though I may decide to use established channels once the material is released. However, in the first instance the digital albums will be downloadable from my Bandcamp page and, since others I consulted said they would like a hard copy, I will also be printing a limited run of CDs for those that want them.</p>
<p>The main challenge for me apart from the obvious financial one which is the reason for this campaign, is time. This is the only reason I'm reluctant to commit to delivering both halves of the double album within a given timeframe. These two factors are also the reasons why I'm not offering a vinyl option at this point. The fact is that vinyl is so expensive to produce that committing to it might raise the premium for the campaign beyond the achievable and also would delay the entire project as I would only be prepared to produce vinyl of the completed double album. So vinyl is something that I will be happy to look at down the line but, unfortunately, it is not for now.</p>
<p>There is no risk that I won't finish this work. However, the ease with which I do this and to some extent the quality of the final product will be dictated by the funds raised.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>No Funds for Finance? You Can Still Help</h3>
<p>If you are not in a position to buy or donate but still want to support this project, I will be delighted if you just share it as best you can. Indiegogo provides share tools to make this easy for you.</p>

Welcome to the fundraising efforts of an indie art-pop siren. I'm Virginia Marcs and I've put together an important story. Five powerful songs and their accompanying videos will comprise my next EP, Reckoning:

Reckoning: A self-reflective operatic-in-scope, Portishead-style dreamscape about realizing the gaslighting that has happened in my life and learning to trust my instincts again (demo featured in the video above)
Strung: An acceptance of the rage that comes from being a trauma survivor
This Time: An anthemic battle cry against misogyny and all of its trappings
Good Enough: An anxiety-ridden ode to an ever-plaguing impostor syndrome that turns on its head and ends with hope
Dark: ""You can sit in the dark my friend, I will hold your hand. I have known darkness too, so I will sit by you."" (demo featured at the end of the video above)

I believe these stories will help people heal, connect them to the collective and pull them out of the isolation they may feel, even if for only a moment. 
I'm teaming up again with badass, whiskey-drinking, indie-pop producer Katie Buchanan for the recording and production. Then I will work with MTV VMA award-winning editor and director Alexander Hammer to create videos for you to experience each piece of this story.
In order for this project to move forward now, instead of taking 2-3 years longer, I need you. Consider yourselves: The Recording Contract of the People. <3

The additional cost of perks, the marketing materials, PR fees, photography and other miscellaneous costs will come out of my pocket.
On October 1, I applied for the NYC Women's Fund for Media, Music and Theatre and intend to use any additional funds awarded toward music videos.

Destiny
Making my second large recording effort at the (super young) age of 37 and working on video projects like this is a dream. Unfortunately, doing this on my own without industry support means taking many years to finish a project like this. Preorders and crowdfunding from colleagues, neighbors, friends, family, fans in Sarasota, Orlando, Mount Dora, Saint Petersburg, London, New York, Jersey City, Virginia, West Virginia, Arkansas, Missouri, California, Boston, Australia, Chile, and elsewhere, will make this project possible and provide a springboard for my career so that I can share my music with the whole world. 
Why this project needs to be made:

This project is unapologetically feminist and addresses the issues of gaslighting, trauma, misogyny, cultural stigmas and more. 
I'm bringing these powerful songs to life with the help of my badass female producer, Katie Buchanan - collaborating two strong female visions to get this story told in a world of primarily male producers.
I've learned the power of adding visual storytelling to the mix and am blessed with the friendships/relationships to make this a reality. There is a reason that Alexander Hammer has made a name for himself in the industry. The work he does is unparalleled. It would be remiss of us to leave this opportunity on the floor.


Risks & Challenges
There's a chance I won't receive any funding from the grant. In that case, the video-making process will take much longer and I need to start releasing videos when the actual song comes out in order to garner proper press and gain capital in the industry. If I do not receive the grant, there are a few ways I will handle it.

To prepare for this possibility, I am creating flex goals during the campaign, so that once we've secured funding for recording, production, mixing, mastering and distribution, I will open it up for funding for a cinematographer for the first video.
I'll then open up a second goal to add funds for effects and color-correction.
If we don't come up with that funding and I am not awarded the grant, Alex and I will take the long road and create 2-3 videos. The story will not be shown in full, but something will be better than nothing. We have discussed some storytelling alternatives as backup plans

Other Ways You Can Help
If you can't preorder or contribute financially - I still love you. I promise. Here are some things that can help that cost nothing:

Please share this campaign with at least one person, individually, who you think would be interested.

<p><strong>Hi! I am a songwriter and performer from Virginia. I have been writing and performing in various bands since around 2006. A few years ago I became a mother and decided to take a huge step back to focus on my family.  Now I am returning to music with my very first SOLO ALBUM!</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Most of the songs and ideas for this record have spent YEARS on the back burner and I am so very excited to have finally brought it to life.  </li>

Most of the songs and ideas for this record have spent YEARS on the back burner and I am so very excited to have finally brought it to life.  
This album has given voice to my humanity, my desires, my hurts and is incredibly meaningful to me. I have placed my full self into it and have been extremely fortuitous to have gotten to create it with the help of some tremendously prolific voices, instrumentalists, and minds.

<h3>Who is MilArt?</h3>
<p>Milana has been playing piano and singing since her early childhood, it really ran in her family: her first teachers were her grandma and her dad. Arty has been an audiophile for two decades, also following his dad's footsteps. Five years ago we started our shared musical journey: from the first shy recordings of Milana's improvisations on a digital piano to the fully equipped home studio with an acoustic grand piano and recording equipment. We released eight original albums and participated in several collaborative ones, performed on radio and TV shows, festivals and solo concerts, gained thousands of followers on social platforms. We are proud of making it the indie way, without any label to back it all up, while also being able to support other artists too.</p>
<p>We are dreamers and what do they say? Dream BIG? So, we tried to and now we need your help to make the Dream happen!!</p>
<h3>A Prelude to the Dream</h3>
<p>On one Canadian wintry day, back in December 2016, Milana wrote a new song. It was a wintry song, a wondrous theatrical blend of Waltz and Tango, Jazz and Classical. Arty immediately fell in love with it. We both felt like this song is way bigger than any song we ever wrote before.</p>
<p>So, we started this project by arranging the song, inviting a vocal coach to shape Milana's singing and then recording it in our home studio - all this was done this Spring of 2017. In May, we wrote the video script together, it turned into a musical story, a story about magic and a dream, a fantasy and the reality.</p>
<p>The following month we spent scouting for different locations and designing the decorations. In August we hired a friend to improve the orchestration we did ourselves and then we hired a remote sax player to record the sax solo. We also found a professional cinematographer to work on the video and had the first session with him, recording the intro and the finale of the video.</p>
<h3>Intermezzo</h3>
<p>These days we are working with a choreographer to create a dance for her dancers - they will play the role of Snow Queen's court. We are also working with a theatrical makeup artist to design the look of the Queen.</p>
<p>The big day of filming the main part is approaching - 28th of October is when we are going to make the Dream happen on the stage of Kailash Mital Theater in Carleton University of Ottawa!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Crescendo</h3>
<p>So, what is going to happen on 28th of October. Below is the plan:</p>
<ul>
<li>7:30am - wake up and have the first coffee;</li>
<li>8:30am - head out to the theatre;</li>
<li>9:00am - unload all the rented decorations, do the makeup for Milana, set up the lighting for filming the first scenes on an empty stage;</li>
<li>10:20am - have the second coffee;</li>
<li>10:30am - film ~40 seconds of the video script involving the scenes on the empty stage;</li>
<li>12:30pm - have the third coffee and a lunch for the entire crew.</li>
<li>13:00pm - set up the decorations, change costumes, work on the theatrical makeup for Milana and dancers.</li>
<li>4:00pm - have the fourth coffee (yes, we will need it!);</li>
<li>4:10pm - film ~1:30 of the video script in the setting of Snow Queen's Ice Castle, including dancers who will play the role of Queen's court;</li>
<li>6:30pm - move the decorations to change the setting to a new scene;</li>
<li>7:30pm - film ~30 seconds of scenes with a sax player;</li>
<li>9:00pm - take off the decorations;</li>
<li>10:00pm - go home;</li>
</ul>
<p>It's going to be a long-long day, involving 8 actors on the stage and 12-15 more people to run the production: a video director, camera and light assistants, stage decor director, stage assistants, makeup artists, behind-the-scenes video operator, sound operator etc etc. Milana is going to be the main actor, Arty will manage the whole production.</p>
<p>This day is the most challenging part of the project, both scheduling and budget-wise (half of the project's budget is invested into this single day!). This is where your help and funding will be greatly appreciated:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cinematographer services (including camera and light assistants) - $3000;</li>
<li>Choreographer and dancers (including the creation of the dance and rehearsals) - $1500;</li>
<li>Second half of theatre rental fees (the first half is already paid) - $800;</li>
<li>Makeup artist services (two different makeups for Milana and dancers) - $600;</li>
<li>Decor and additional lighting rental - $800;</li>
<li>Lunch for the entire crew - $300;</li>
</ul>
<p>This is where <strong>YOUR HELP</strong> is <strong>MUCH NEEDED</strong>! And if you happen to live in Ottawa, we'll gladly accept any assistance on the filming day (you will be credited in the video, for sure!).</p>

<b>Good morning, campers, and thanks for checking out The Sound Field's fundraiser page.</b>
</span><br/></p><p></p>
<p><b>Who We Are</b></p>
<p>The Sound Field is a three-piece electric band in San Francisco, performing
entirely original music. Singer and guitarist Deborah Grabien, who's
responsible for all the songs, has been playing guitar since age 10 (a very,
very long time ago) and songwriting since her teens. Deb and her husband, bassist Nic Grabien, have been making music together since 1976. (I did say a long, long time ago, yes?)<br/><br/>She's also co-written songs performed and recorded by guitarist Mark Karan with his own band <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9Zp4tKQFaI"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9Zp4tKQFaI</a>, and with Lansdale Station founder Lauren Murphy (<a href=""http://www.laurenmurphymusic.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.laurenmurphymusic.com/</a>)

<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">. </span></p>
<p>The band in its current form came together entirely because
of ace drummer Larry Luthi. Larry heard Deb and Nic jamming, really liked the
songs, and leaned on the others to put a band together. So, in late Autumn of
2013, The Sound Field began rehearsing.</p>
<p><b>A Little History</b></p>
<p>Shortly after we started, we played an hour-long fundraiser
for South Bay radio station KKUP. Not long after that, we decided we had it together enough to try the waters at the Monday night open mic night at Mill
 Valley's Sweetwater, hosted by local keyboard legend Austin DeLone. Since then we've become the house band on Monday nights, playing a handful of our own songs, usually with Austin on keys <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVdhjxy0dig"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVdhjxy0dig</a>, <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">and then backing some of the guests. </span></p>
<p><b>Gigging Locally</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>The Sound Field is settling into a once-a-month regular gig
at Second Act, on San Francisco's legendary Haight Street. We can also be found playing the second Tuesday of every month for a song or two at El Rio, San Francisco's best dive bar, playing with the fabulous Los Train Wreck.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Now That We Hopefully Have Your Attention...</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>We're looking to raise <b>$10,000 </b>to get ourselves into the
studio and cut an EP of completely original songs. One song in particular
""Fearless"", will be cut separately. All proceeds from that one will go directly to our friend Tracy, who is battling late stage disseminated Lyme
disease. No medical insurance covers any treatment for this, and Lyme patients
must pay for it out of their own pockets. We're hoping this will put a little
money into her fund. <i>Let us know if you specifically want your contribution to go to this part of the project.</i></p>
<p>The EP will be recorded locally, with Mark Karan producing. </p>
<p>A large chunk of that $10k will go primarily to the costs of producing the EP: studio time for tracking, mixing and mastering, plus Mark's guidance as producer. Another chunk will go to hire guests such as Austin DeLone (we love his keyboard work and he likes playing with us, so it's Austin for the win), and hopefully a couple of other local and national giants.</p>
<p>If we come up short, we'll scale back a little, but still produce as much of a project as we can afford. If we raise more than the above-mentioned $10K, we'll happily stretch it out to an LP.</p><p><b>Take a Look and a Listen</b></p><p>For a very good idea of who we are, what we play and what we sound like, click the <b>Gallery </b>link up above. We've uploaded a few videos from various shows, and a handful of photos and logos and so forth.</p>
<p><b>Perks!</b></p><p>Please have a look at the perks offered, and see what rocks your socks. You'll notice all the usual perks (tee-shirts, downloads, CDs) with a few slightly more unusual ones (handmade hula hoops, hour-long massages by a master, and some killer desserts).<br/></p>
<p><b>Thanks for reading this far!</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>And there you go: what we're doing and what we're offering.
Please share this on your social media - we really want to get into the studio,
get it together, get it on, and get it out!</p>

<div>As young musicians passionate about opera and about the city they grew up in, Emily Nelson and Bethany Schweitzer Goshorn thought to themselves one day, why don't we have an opera on tap chapter in a city known for it's microbrews and amazing wines and spirits? After some contemplation, they decided if anyone should make it happen, it might as well be them! So they contacted the national organization and got a charter for a Portland chapter. </div>
<div>Why be so passionate about opera? Because it speaks to the human condition. It expresses human emotion and relationship in a very unique and profound way. The human voice in all its glory has an almost visceral effect on us.

 is a small monastery in the north of Serbia where I visit occasionally.
 It’s the home to two dozen monks who begin their days with a 4am 
service, work in the monastery during the day producing candles and 
honey, cook meatless meals, and keep the rare and ancient musical 
tradition of Byzantine chanting in their services and choir practice. 
Over the years I made friends there and had been invited to join in the 
evening service and stay for their simple meals. During one of the 
visits two years ago, I recorded a Byzantine chant in the small 
monastery chapel. <br/><br/>I incorporated that recording in <i>Beyond Zero</i>, a 
piece with music and film that Bill Morrison and I made for Kronos Quartet for the centennial of World War One.  <i>Beyond Zero</i> ends with fragments of a 
Byzantine hymn, “Eternal Memory to the Virtuous,” chanted by the monks in remembrance to all who lost their
 lives in the Great War and every single war since then.  When 
Kronos Quartet came to perform <i>Beyond Zero</i> in Serbia this fall, I invited my friends from 
the monastery to the concert. To my surprise, they not only accepted to 
come to the concert, but offered to perform their part live! It was an 
amazing, emotionally charged event, with several distant worlds merging 
on the stage.<p></p>
<p>Kronos Quartet will perform <i>Beyond Zero</i> in 
Carnegie Hall on March 7th. Your generous contribution will enable 
the Kovilj monastery monks perform live at this event, and three 
days later at a concert in Urbana, IL. <br/></p>

friends!  These funds are to support the travel, lodging, visa expenses,

organizing a project helping support the musical needs for the people of
Cuba.  Cuba's music organizations and related school programs need
instruments and music accessories. Our objective is bringing musically related items
to help them continue their musical interest with up-to-date equipment and accessories. We
spent the last 2 years planning a way to get to Cuba and it's finally becoming a
reality. </p>
<p>Our original plans included taking an
industrial container full of instruments to Cuba and distributing them to
school systems with a shortage of music items. Our dreams met reality when we
discovered a great idea is not as simple as it sounds. We realize starting
small is the best way to approach our music instrument drive.  This April
we will donate music accessories to a Cuban orchestra while also building
relations with other music organizations to learn about their music needs.</p>
<p><b><i>Milton's thoughts:</i></b></p>
<p>On April 5th we venture on our
mission ""Sembrando Semilla"" (Planting Seeds). Our current goals are downsized
to reflect reality. Jeff and I will meet with organizations in Cuba, visiting
schools and getting to know the people we hope to help.  Furthermore
there are current discussions in the media about the embargo and how our government
is easing restrictions on Cuba relations. Does this mean we should not go forth
with our dreams and goals?  I don’t think so. That’s why on April 5th, approaching
quickly, we will be on our way! It may take years to undo what over 50 years of
the embargo has done to the progress of Cuba and we are not waiting any longer
- the time is now! I have always taken an interest in music and
Cuba.  Latin music has been an inspiration to me; it’s instilled in my
heart and culture. Planting this seed in Cuba and in our local community will
guarantee us the development of future artists and exceptional music. </p>
<p>Our concept for this project is to
plant seeds, not actual seeds, but a seed of hope, enjoyment, and opportunity
that will last a lifetime for many. Our message is with the right tools and
education there is nothing a child cannot accomplish. I had a seed planted in
me growing up in the city of Philadelphia. I had several seeds planted in me my
whole life; from Aspira that taught me how to find my first job, to a father
who taught me the value of hard work.  As a child I was exposed to music
but never had the opportunity to take lessons and grow.  It took 30 years
but I finally enrolled in ALMA (Artístas y Músicos Latino Americanos). The
instructors took a seed of music that was dormant and brought it to life. In
the short period of time I was there I came to realize that I must be involved
in the arts one way or another. I am continuing my education Studying Digital
Video Production at CCP (Community College Of Philadelphia) and now I hope to
plant seeds in others to help them grow their musical talents. So planting
seeds in Cuba is our first stop.  Wow I’m excited about this project to be
able to help a student become the musician of tomorrow by planting this seed
and I hope you are also.</p>
<p><b><i>Jeff's thoughts: </i></b></p>
<p> Cuba has so many genres of music
including Son Montuno, rhumba, Afro-Cuban jazz and salsa; all of these have
influenced so many new styles in our society throughout history. We wish to
support the next generation of Cuban musicians and you can be a part of this
experience.  A little over 2 years ago Milton and I met with my
friend Pamela Martin to discuss Cuba where she has traveled in excess of 65 trips.
She expressed the desperate need for music instruments and accessories from her
personal experience with the Cuban people. Pamela has a close relationship with
a Cuban orchestra called Camerata Romeu (this is our first recipient of our
donated strings and accessories) in addition to many others in the related arts
field. I have known Pamela's family for
over 15 years and it's great to be visiting Cuba with her. My background
includes working in music related fields such as composing, recording and music
licensing. I current live in the Philadelphia suburbs and have known Milton for
over 5 years; it's a great pleasure to be working Pamela and Milton on this
Cuba venture. </p>
<p><b>What
We Need &amp; What You Get </b></p>
<p>We are very excited about this
project but it will not be successful without your financial support. Our main
goal is to purchases musical supplies (violin, viola, cello and bass stings,
rosin, blank sheet music, pencils and anything else) and to transport to those
most in need.   Your financial support is critical to our success. 
Should funding exceed our goals than even more supplies will make it to Cuba on
our initial trip<b>. </b></p>
<p>We will document our activities
through still images and video recording to share with our donors. See Perks
for Details. </p>
<p>Thank you for your help in
supporting our project!</p>
<p><b>The
Impact</b></p>
<p>What impact will your donations
make? As our instrument drive develops, students in Cuba will have the tools
they need to learn to play a musical instrument and continue to fill our future
with new artistry. Not every one of these students will become great musicians,
but we believe music makes an impact in all of our live. “Learning music
facilitates learning other subjects and enhances skills that children
inevitably use in other areas. A music-rich experience for children of singing,
listening and moving is really bringing a very serious benefit to children as
they progress into more formal learning,” says Mary Luehrisen, executive
director of the National Association of Music Merchants (NAMM) Foundation, a
not-for-profit association that promotes the benefits of making music. </p>
<p>We have both seen the impact music
plays in people’s lives and without the proper tools it’s just a little more difficult
to achieve. We can only imagine what the music future holds when you pair music
skills with basic music necessities.<span>  </span></p>

<p><b>Other
Ways You Can Help</b></p>
<p>We know not everyone can help fund
this project but there is still something you can do. If you have a new or used
small instrument or accessory that are not being used consider donating it to
our cause. Please share this worthwhile cause with friends and family. So make
some noise about our campaign. Use the Indiegogo share tools! It’s just a
little click away to begin Planting Seeds /Sembrando Semillas.</p>
