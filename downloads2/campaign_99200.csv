<p>Our campaign is to have umbrella stations around University allowing students, at a small cost to 'hire' an umbrella for a certain number of hours to allow them to get home, or to a next class without getting caught in the rain. As students ourselves we are always getting caught in the rain and as the campus is big we will end up getting wetter walking back to our accommodation to get an umbrella.

<p> </p>
<p>We need £596 for our start-up costs. This breaks down too:</p>
<p>- Umbrellas - £1 = £560 to buy = £560</p>
<p>- Baskets - £3 = £10 to buy = £30</p>
<p>-Poster - £100 = £0.06 = £6</p>
<p>So, overall we are looking for an investment of £596 so we are able to buy all the essentials to start our business. If our goal is not met we aim to donate the money to a local Liverpool homeless charity.</p>
<p>The risk with our campaign is lack of funding, if our goal is not met we will not be able to buy all the essentials to start up. Also, we face admin issues as we want to integrate our usage system into an existing platform at University which may prove tricky.</p>

This makes it a positive material for the earth and as a building block for the development of extraordinary products. Our bamboo is grown naturally without any pesticides or cutting down of local forests. The harvesting process is also plant friendly because instead of cutting down the plant and killing it as you do with trees, we simply trim the bamboo without harming the plant core. It is a great relationship because by trimming the plants they are not harmed and typically grow back to their pre-harvest size within a year. Within 3-5 years the pole will harden and can be harvested again. This process will last the lifetime of the plant which is around 100 years. During the growing process, these plants convert large amounts of CO2 from the atmosphere into usable oxygen and usable plant material. Pair that with the fact that we plant a tree for every board we sell and you can see how quickly of a positive impact we can make together.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1532805361/sbfnivgru9s1ib5b534c.png"" src=""""/></p><p><u>Cork</u></p><p>Cork is one of the most amazing and underused natural materials on the earth. It requires little to no alterations and produces products that are waterproof, supple, and when ground into smaller pieces can be molded into thousands of possible creations. Our cork products start out their life growing on the beautiful hillsides of Portugal. Every 10 years the cork oak trees bark is harvested. This harvesting does not harm the trees and instead only removes the outer bark. The amazing thing about the cork tree is that it can have its bark completely removed and remain unharmed. The harvested cork bark is then taken and stamped out into wine stoppers. The excess scraps from this process are ground into smaller pieces and molded into deck pads. It is an amazing process that requires little to no additional additives. We like to joke that we are picking deck pads from a tree just like you would apples from an apple tree.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1532805410/ekatb40fiij0n9of3d1a.png"" src=""""/></p><p><u>Coconut</u></p><p>Our coconut products start out their lives in the trees high above the jungle. Once the coconuts reach maturity they are carefully harvested so as to leave the tree completely unharmed. The coconuts are then used either in food production for their sweet meat or their delicious coconut water. We then take the husks, which used to be thrown away, and create beautiful products. This is an awesome process because it takes something destined for a landfill and turns it into something extraordinary instead.

Realizing this, we wanted to create a board that would not only outperform standard boards but would also impact the world in a positive way. What we ended up with was beyond anything we could have ever dreamed of.    The BoardsAll of our boards are 100% sustainable and Eco-Friendly. They are stronger, more buoyant, and last up to 5 times longer than standard foam boards while remaining extremely lightweight. There are a few other companies out there that claim to create Eco-Friendly boards by using recycled foam and super sap resins, but in reality, they are just continuing to use the same toxic products that continue to pollute and harm the earth. Our boards are the FIRST AND ONLY TRULY ECO-FRIENDLY BOARDS. They are made with naturally grown bamboo, plant-based cloths, and a plant-based epoxy. After the bamboo is responsibly grown and harvested, it is then pushed through a cutting dye to produce long thin strips. These strips are then trimmed to form equal width and length sizes and glued together to form flat sheets of bamboo. The frame for the board is then cut from the sheet and assembled. Most of the shape of the board (except the rails) is created from our patent-pending frame designs that have been designed over years of prototyping and testing rounds. We then glue a sheet onto the bottom of the bamboo frame.After the bottom has dried and trimmed we build up the rails by gluing small strips of bamboo to created the rail shape.Then we glue on the top sheet and hand shape it all down to the finished board design. This process creates a massive pocket of trapped air inside the center of the board which allows the board to be ultra light and extremely buoyant. Finally, we coat the board in a plant-based epoxy and plant cloth to create a long-lasting waterproof seal. We use a similar process to create all our other products including: Skimboards - Made from 2 opposing grain sheetsHandplanes - Made from 3 opposing grain sheetsGlasses - Made from a single sheetDeck Traction Pads - Made from natural cork The Clothing While we put a large emphasis on our boards (and rightly so) we also offer other amazing eco-friendly products like our clothing. All of our clothing is made out of eco-friendly bamboo and coconut fiber.Bamboo ClothingOur bamboo clothing is mixed of approximately 95% bamboo fiber and 5% spandex. This mix allows for ultra comfort while remaining extremely breathable. If you have never owned a piece of bamboo clothing you are missing out because not only is it extremely comfortable it is also UV protectant. These attributes make it great for athletic, pleasure, or beach wear.Coconut Clothing Our coconut clothing is made with a similar mix of approximately 95% coconut fiber and 5% spandex. It breathes and feels similar to our bamboo cloth except when using coconut we get a much denser packed fiber. This densely packed fiber makes it much better suited to clothing that will last a long time without breaking down. These attributes make it great for beach and swimwear. Sustainability BambooWe chose bamboo because it is one of the fastest growing plants on the earth while also exhibiting extraordinary strength to weight ratios. This makes it a positive material for the earth and as a building block for the development of extraordinary products. Our bamboo is grown naturally without any pesticides or cutting down of local forests. The harvesting process is also plant friendly because instead of cutting down the plant and killing it as you do with trees, we simply trim the bamboo without harming the plant core. It is a great relationship because by trimming the plants they are not harmed and typically grow back to their pre-harvest size within a year. Within 3-5 years the pole will harden and can be harvested again. This process will last the lifetime of the plant which is around 100 years. During the growing process, these plants convert large amounts of CO2 from the atmosphere into usable oxygen and usable plant material. Pair that with the fact that we plant a tree for every board we sell and you can see how quickly of a positive impact we can make together.CorkCork is one of the most amazing and underused natural materials on the earth. It requires little to no alterations and produces products that are waterproof, supple, and when ground into smaller pieces can be molded into thousands of possible creations. Our cork products start out their life growing on the beautiful hillsides of Portugal. Every 10 years the cork oak trees bark is harvested. This harvesting does not harm the trees and instead only removes the outer bark. The amazing thing about the cork tree is that it can have its bark completely removed and remain unharmed. The harvested cork bark is then taken and stamped out into wine stoppers. The excess scraps from this process are ground into smaller pieces and molded into deck pads. It is an amazing process that requires little to no additional additives. We like to joke that we are picking deck pads from a tree just like you would apples from an apple tree.CoconutOur coconut products start out their lives in the trees high above the jungle. Once the coconuts reach maturity they are carefully harvested so as to leave the tree completely unharmed. The coconuts are then used either in food production for their sweet meat or their delicious coconut water. We then take the husks, which used to be thrown away, and create beautiful products. This is an awesome process because it takes something destined for a landfill and turns it into something extraordinary instead. While you may think of coconut fiber as a hard course material, we have created a process that makes it as comfortable and soft as cotton. Trees and Supersoil/Particle BoardFor every board that we sell we have made a promise to plant a tree. There are many places in the world where deforestation and unsustainable harvesting of trees is causing the extinction of animals and their habitats which leads to erosion and ultimately the destruction of our planet. The first step in healing this broken system is to replant and replace everything taken.All of the extra bamboo, unusable pieces, and dust that are created during the harvesting and shaping of our boards are collected up and made into either super soil (a composted mixture of bamboo and cow dung) or particle board (a mixture of bamboo pieces and plant-based epoxy) which we then donate to local communities. This along with our solar power factory is all part of our push for a carbon negative zero waste production process. The PlanPhase 1 - Idea Creation (3 Months)When we came up with this idea we spent about 3 months researching and developing how we could actually take it from the initial idea through development and into production. Countless hours were spend and many miles were traveled to find the correct materials and the correct personnel to make our dream a reality.Phase 2 - Design and Development (8 Months)We then spend the next 8 months with the best and brightest engineers, shapers, and surfers on the planet designing and prototyping our products. Everyone really came together and pushed through long weekends and countless hours spent refining designs to create the perfect products.  Phase 3 - Fundraising (2-3 Months) This is where we are today. We need your help in funding our project so that we can continue our dream and start producing products on a commercial scale.Phase 4 - Manufacturing (5 Months)After obtaining funding from you we are going to move quickly into our new factory and get to work producing products. We will continually update you with videos and updates on our progress. Based on our current timeline we plan on having our first set of boards shipping out in March of 2019. We have confidence that we can achieve this goal because between our engineers and management staff we have over 15 years of experience bringing products to market.  Support UsWhile we are extremely excited to get up and running, we know that without your help we will not be able to make the positive impact we set out to. So please help us in any way you can. Whether that’s buying a board, joining us on one of our tree planting trips, or simply helping us get the word out; we would appreciate every little bit you could do for us. Thank you for taking the time to view our campaign and we hope you join us in creating a sustainable future we can all be proud of.",25.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Where is The Jam?</h3>
<p>Where is the Jam? is an idea which wants to help people to know places before visiting them. This idea born a Year Ago when we have to throw a party to a boss that was going into a long trip, The problem was that the day we have to do it was a Wednesday. We were searching for a good place to go for more than two hours. Finally, we surrender and went to our boss's house to watch movies... a lame farewell.</p>
<p>With where is the Jam? you will always know how a place is going, what they are doing there and additional information about this places. Also, you could look at photos and videos of this place in real time. You will not give a bad farewell again.</p>
<p>If we suceed, we will develop a free app around the world suited to every one that wants to hang out despite the day. Also, we could help new business to shine, showing the people the magic of new business.</p>
<p>To develop this idea we will have to achieve at least 20.000 USD (Just to pay a company to make the App) The other 10.000 Will be used in marketing campaigns. (We will always upload an excel tab with every expense and billing information.)</p>
<p>If we can´t achieve this goal, we will try to make the app with someone that could give us a lower price. If we can´t also achieve this, we will use the money into the development of a new idea with the help of every donor. </p>
<p><font>Risks:</font></p>
<ol><li><font>Not achieving the first stage users.</font></li></ol>
<p>How to solve them:</p>
<p>1. There is some risk in the development of this APP. First of all we need to reach every place than we can and let them know about the app, this to register them to the app. At least at the beginning, we have to move very fast this app because if it doesn´t have the correct amount of places the user will get bored about it. </p>
<p>To solve this issue we are working right now with people that works in different type of places promoting them. They will let us make a connection between many places and Where is the Jam.</p>
<p>Other ways to help:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can always share our campaing to every one you know, the more people that know us easier will be to achieve the market.</li>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>

<ul>
<li>Sabreena is a seasoned yachtswoman who happens to be Transgender, she has spent the last 3 years training and preparing by sailing on the Great Lakes in the State of Michigan.</li>
<li>Project REVOLUTION’s Mission is three fold, the first being to break the World Record for Fastest Around Alone in an Open 40, Second is for Sabreena to shatter the glass ceiling in the sailing world by not only claiming the World Record but to be the First Transgender Woman to Sail Solo Nonstop Around the World. Third is to change the conversation about Transgender, to send a message that is loud and clear, that Transgender people are just people, who have dreams and aspirations like everyone else, that they just want to be respected and appreciated for the courage it takes to be who they are and for the passion with which they pursue their dreams.</li>
<li>By donating to Sabreena’s Campaign you are helping her to do what all her critics have already told her can not be done, the cost of pursuing this challenge can be overwhelming financially, Public Relations is near the top of that list. To achieve her dream she needs representation which she now has, but has been difficult to cover in terms of dollars, having her PR Team she has now allows her to focus on her sailing and training while her PR Team of Amy Taeuber and Sophie Taeuber of The PR Bible reach out to media and sponsors, without their vast wealth of contacts and networking experience Sabreena would not be able to make the inroads that her PR Team has access to.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>

<ul><li>At present we need $6000 to cover Public Relations expenses for the next 6 months until we have the sponsors required to financially handle the costs going forward, without that support Sabreena’s Mission can not go forward. One of the cool ideas we want to offer is when you make a donation of $20 or more your name will be a part of a wrap around Sabreena’s Boat and your names will make the historic and record breaking journey around the world, the names will be seen in images taken of Sabreena and her boat while in Sydney and underway from start to finish.</li></ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>We live in a time where we thought we had made significant inroads, but due to recent political upheaval Transgender people have now been placed in great danger by a reckless and bigoted Government  that has gone out of its way to harm Transgender people like Sabreena by stripping them of the protections they fought so long and hard for, violence against them has not only been tolerated it has been encouraged. By donating to Sabreena and her quest, we are hoping that her journey will swing the pendulum back the other way to a conversation about love, acceptance and tolerance for others deemed different. By showing her remarkable courage and commitment to not just her dream but to her community, she will be telling them that if you have a dream, believe in that dream and work hard that it can come true, that no matter what the coomunity’s enemies say otherwise. It will hopefully show to not just Sabreena’s detractors but the Transgender Community’s as well that there nothing to fear from her or her community, that in fact Transgender people are brave, courageous, loving and compassionate human beings who deserve to be accorded the same respect that is demanded of them by their enemies.</li>
<li>Think about how hard this challenge is that Sabreena has chosen to take on, over 200 people have sailed solo nonstop around the world, of those 200 or so people only 12 have been girls/women, and no Transgender man nor woman has so much as attempted to do what Sabreena is trying to accomplish, make no mistake this is a goal that has brought even the toughest of people to strife.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>Solo Sailing is a dangerous endevour that requires total focus and an unwavering commitment from the moment Sabreena unties from the pier until she is safely moored once more upon her return. There are any number of hazards involved with sailing solo nonstop around the world, from submerged objects, to rogue waves, equipment failures, the list goes on. To mitigate the risk Sabreena has the most capable Project Adviser anyone could ask for in Bruce Arms of Gold Coast Queensland Australia. Bruce is an accomplished solo sailor in his own right and was responsible for Jessica Watson becoming the youngest to have ever sailed solo nonstop around the world in 2010. It was Bruce’s meticulous attention to every detail that allowed the then 16 year old Jessica to achieve her dream, it was his forward thinking that allowed Bruce to prepare Jessica for every eventuality including the things no one would remotely think of and it is that same attention to detail that Bruce will bring to bear to ensure Sabreena is as safe as possible and to give her the best shot at being safe and successful.</li></ul>

Think about how hard this challenge is that Sabreena has chosen to take on, over 200 people have sailed solo nonstop around the world, of those 200 or so people only 12 have been girls/women, and no Transgender man nor woman has so much as attempted to do what Sabreena is trying to accomplish, make no mistake this is a goal that has brought even the toughest of people to strife.


Risks & Challenges
 
Solo Sailing is a dangerous endevour that requires total focus and an unwavering commitment from the moment Sabreena unties from the pier until she is safely moored once more upon her return. There are any number of hazards involved with sailing solo nonstop around the world, from submerged objects, to rogue waves, equipment failures, the list goes on. To mitigate the risk Sabreena has the most capable Project Adviser anyone could ask for in Bruce Arms of Gold Coast Queensland Australia. Bruce is an accomplished solo sailor in his own right and was responsible for Jessica Watson becoming the youngest to have ever sailed solo nonstop around the world in 2010. It was Bruce’s meticulous attention to every detail that allowed the then 16 year old Jessica to achieve her dream, it was his forward thinking that allowed Bruce to prepare Jessica for every eventuality including the things no one would remotely think of and it is that same attention to detail that Bruce will bring to bear to ensure Sabreena is as safe as possible and to give her the best shot at being safe and successful.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>The 411</h3>
<p>Picture this - two girls from Los Angeles, taking part in a global road rally in order to raise money for charity, barreling through the deserts of Kazakhstan in a glorified tin can moonlighting as an actual car.  </p>
<p>The Mongol Rally is a worldwide rally put on by The Adventurists.  We will be driving from London to Siberia across deserts and mountain ranges, driving on roads ranging from pavement to not-an-actual-road.  No Google Maps, no route, no back-up - just the delusion of a good idea, a language barrier and a prayer. </p>
<p>As you can imagine, driving 10,000 miles across 1/3 of the globe involves a few expenses.   From visas and insurance to petrol and unexpected costs, there's quite a bit that goes into pulling off this bucket of adventure.  That's where you come in.</p>

<li>$1000 (plus any extra we can get) for Cool Earth</li>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Since we have the privilege of traipsing across so much of the planet that we live in, it only seems fair to give back to it and try to leave it just a tiny bit better. </p>
<p>In hopes of doing so, we have chosen <a href=""http://www.coolearth.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Cool Earth</a> as our charity.  Cool Earth works alongside rain forest communities to halt deforestation and its impact on climate change.  From setting up an in-country team to working directly with communities and local NGOs to develop their capacity, Cool Earth's partnerships are community-led and adaptable to each location.</p>
<p>FUN FACT - Over the years, The Adventurists have raised over $8M for Cool Earth!</p>

<p>There aren't a whole lot of vacation spots owned and operated by Queer and/or Racialized people. Most of the hospitality industry, especially in the travel &amp; tourism sector, has been dominated by people with more social power. </p>
<p>While we know we can create an environment that would be safe for everyone to enjoy and thrive in, we haven't received the same treatment in return from the majority of vacation rental spots we've been to.</p>
<p>We have been inspired by the way a few select B&amp;B and hostel owners have created warm and nurturing environments for us as a couple over the years and have had enough experiences to know that they were the exceptions to the rule.</p>
<p>Vacations should be restorative, and full of opportunities to feel treated and cared for. We want to make a place where anyone can come and feel treated well, which is why we are also explicitly affirming for Queer/Trans, Racialized, Disabled, Fat and/or Polyam folks, so everyone feels freer to connect deeply to themselves, their partner(s), and the natural world around us.  </p>
<p>Supporting our vision for Golden Gaze B&amp;B<strong> </strong>means you're supporting a place of healing, transformation, and connection for everyone. It means you're investing in Queer and Black businesses, and helping create a world that is a healthier, more vibrant place for everyone to enjoy and thrive in. </p>
<p> To make Golden Gaze come to life it will have to be because people believe in it and want to see more places like this exist. We know we aren't alone! There are thousands of Queer, Racialized, and/or Disabled folks who have a dream just like ours.  When our campaign is successful, we commit to helping those with similar dreams come to life in return, and have already been cross-promoting other community oriented projects, artisans, and healers.<br/> </p>

<p>As any new business or enterprise comes with risks and challenges, we are prepared to face whatever may try and get in the way of realizing our dream.</p>
<p>While owning a business that involves housing people might have other maintenance challenges down the road, there are very few challenges we foresee impacting our ability to open an amazing and affirming B&amp;B.</p>
<p>The biggest challenge we have anticipated is the initial funding--which is why you are here! As a young, Queer, Interracial couple, who has predominantly worked in the non-profit and hospitality industries, we have gained the years of experience necessary to manage a successful business, and gained none of the financial capital that is typically rewarded to people who pursue more capitalism-driven industries and/or those who have other privileges that involve wealth. </p>
<p>Second, is securing the land. The location of Golden, B.C. is idyllic, and tourism has seen a noticeable increase (~7% annually) in the last few years. While there are many beautiful properties available in Golden, B.C, we have our eyes set on a 40+ acre property just a short drive from Golden. We have the funds secured to pay for a down-payment on this land, but didn't want to purchase a property without knowing if we'd be able to fund the remainder of building. Once we reach our funding goal, we will be able to go forward with land acquisition. There are many properties available nearby, so we are confident this will not be a problem in going forward with this location. But just in case, we are encouraging people to back the vision, not the specific location in case we have to move our project elsewhere in the mountains. </p>
<p>The last challenge is delayed paperwork. The housing we would provide would be made of sustainable resources using Green Magic Homes,<strong> </strong>creating both a unique looking, eco-friendly, and long-lasting environment. With sustainability being a top priority, our utilities will be run on renewable energy sources to ensure a more cohesive relationship with our environment. Green magic homes is certified to build in 30+ countries, including the USA, Mexico, and many South American and European nations. The permit process for Canada has been slower due to Covid-19, but they are confident they will have the final necessary approvals to build soon. Should there be any further delays, we will diligently update our backers. Because we would be the first in Canada to build Green Magic Homes, this gives you the opportunity to be among the very first to stay in this unique housing!

Optional packages for self- and relationship- coaching using the Enneagram
Sustainable dome style cabins to feel truly a part of nature
Relaxing and nature inspired amenities (see below)

Whether you're interested in a romantic getaway, or looking for a place to reconnect with yourself, search no further than Golden Gaze B&B for the refreshing oasis of your dreams.
​Our vision for Golden Gaze stands upon 5 core values:

We are willing to create a website platform for everyone who stand in aware of global warming. We believe that there are many benefits of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Government, business, community, households and individuals are all helping. Everyone’s efforts can make a difference.It is now more profitable than ever to be green. The profit we can make from the solutions is greater than the profit from the problems. We reverse global warming then we make the profit, because it’s less expensive, more beneficial and more jobs.There are 4.6 billion people are aware of global warming. The median of people perceiving it as a threat were 47%. If we were one nation, we would be bigger than 28 nations in the Europe union. We would also be bigger than 31 developed countries together.They estimate that, right now, more than 7,000 cities from 133 countries and 6,000 companies with at least $36 trillion in revenue have pledged to take climate action, but this is far beyond that target. Global greenhouse gas emissions need to drop by 55% by 2030, according to the UN. With over 500,000 publicly traded companies worldwide, there are many more that can take steps that cumulatively would have a significant impact on the gap.We need do something together.We will create a platform for everybody to talk and discuss then action. This place can create green projects come to life and will help achieve our target.Our goal is to let 4.6 billion people get involved and create new green businesses, new green jobs, new projects and perform the duties of a good citizen in the Eco Earth community.Now is the moment to let ecoearthcitizen.com come to life.Welcome to join us. Climate change is realAccording to Climate NASA, there are more than nine evidences for rapid climate change:Global Temperature RiseWarming OceansShrinking Ice SheetsGlacial RetreatDecreased Snow CoverSea Level RiseDeclining Arctic Sea IceExtreme EventsOcean AcidificationWe cannot wait for someone do it for us. We need to do it ourselves and do it together, because this is our home, a beautiful planet. Board GameThe Eco Earth board game is a knowledge for climate change and to learn how to solve the problems. The more you help the more prizes you’ll get the more prizes you get the faster you’ll win!Ages 8+ 2-4 playersSuitable for children, adults, travelers, parties, communities, schools, public places………. etc.Contents:1 Game board, 1 spinner, 4 characters, 8 problem cards, 8 solution cards, 8 action cards, 4 clime change cards, 20 citizen board meeting projects, carbon credit award pack, and game guide. Game board 8 Problem CardsCover Problem 1Over the last 250 years we have burned over 1.4 trillion tons of carbon into the atmosphere.Problem 2We look at the rising seas and melting Polar Caps. Those are evidence of climate change. Problem 3The impacts of the climate change: Substantial melting of the ice sheets, rise in sea level, permanent droughts in mid-latitudes and the list goes on. Problem 4Catastrophe would be melting the major ice sheets: the Greenland ice sheet and the West Antarctic sheet, as all the major coastal cities of the world are flooded. Problem 5When the ice sheets melt, we get less land. We’ve got environmental refugees.People leaving the tropics because it’s getting too hot for human habitation, it’s getting too hot for agriculture. Problem 6When the world gets less land, less food, less water and more people, that’s a recipe for national security disaster. Problem 7The threshold is somewhere around six to seven hundred parts per million CO2. That’s warm enough to melt all the ice land and ice in the planet and we have about 80 meters higher sea level. Problem 8Scientist’s predictions are coming true sooner than expected. We are tragically suffering through severe storms, droughts, floods and fires, these would be more intense and unpredictable. 8 Solution CardsCover Solution 1 The current climate crisis is a problem we’ve created, but it is also a problem we can fix. There are only two things we can do about the atmosphere: 1. Stop putting greenhouse gases in the air. 2.

With our first product, the Drive It to Win mobile app, you compete against other drivers for a chance to win cash and prizes. Our app calculates the ideal time it takes for your chosen route. All you have to do is get there closer to the ideal time than the other competitors and you could win!
Compete against anyone, anywhere, anytime!
Target times are based on speed limits and current traffic conditions and there is no phone interaction required while driving. Paying attention to your driving and driving safely, with traffic, results in your best chance of winning. If you're speeding and day dreaming that's a sure fire way to come in last!

Why Help Us?
By contributing to our campaign, you'll be helping us to bring fun back to the morning commute and help relieve the stresses associated with it.
In addition, you'll be helping us turn more commuters into safer drivers and hopefully reduce the number of traffic related injuries and deaths.

What We Need
We need your help in two ways:

Your funding contributions will be used to complete our security testing, add customer retention features (to keep users coming back and driving safe), and to finish development of our IOS version and backend administration features.
We need your feedback. We need a select group of early users who are passionate about our cause and will test the app and help shape it prior to our full launch.


What You Get

All Backers get the satisfaction of knowing that you're contributing to making our roadways safer!
All contributions get you early access to the app. You can  compete in unlimited events during beta testing to prefect your skills and be ready to blow away the competition when we go live!
Basic Tester Package contributions will get you 1 Entry Fee Tokens, a $1 value, which can be used to compete towards winning cash prizes when we go live!
Premium Tester Package contributions will get you 10 Entry Fee Tokens, a $10 value, which can be used to compete towards winning cash prizes when we go live!

NOTE: Cash prizes are not available in Arizona, Delaware, Iowa, Louisiana and Montana. Some additional country restrictions may apply. 
Current Project Status?
We are currently about 90% through our android development, which is fully funded, and we expect to be completed in late May 2017. IOS development is at about 75% and expected to complete in Late June. With your help, we can quickly get through our security testing and get the app in your hands so you can provide feedback for the finishing touches.

Risks & Challenges
We've come a long way since the original idea was hatched. We want to make sure that our app is fair and safe for everyone. Our biggest risk right now getting the right business logic and fraud prevention measures in place to ensure no one can ""cheat the system"".

Other Ways You Can Help
We welcome any level of contribution you can provide. We understand that not everyone is in a position to contribute monetarily. If you believe in our cause and in our product, whether you contribute funding or not, please help us get the word out and share this campaign with your friends and family.   The more people we can reach, the safer our roads will be.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>After 3 years, we believe it has finally arrived. This is the first product we've come up with, but we so many other things ideas for future products that are going to be line with our simple principals. </p>
<p>Our campaign is going to fund patents, trademarks, and designs for our future innovations that are going be environmentally conscious, made with the highest quality materials, and fairly priced for everyone.    </p>

<h3>The Bottle &amp; Challenges We Overcame</h3>
<p><u><strong>One biggest challenge was finding technology that prevents temperature change for what you put in the bottle.</strong></u> After extensive research, we found that vacuum insulation was the best way. With vacuum insulation, air is removed between the bottle walls. With no air, the transfer of heat or cold doesn't penetrate the inside of the bottle. That keeps everything inside the temperature consistent. </p>

<p><u><strong>We also had to overcome a problem of odor and taste transfer.</strong></u> We know people don't just want to put water in the bottle. There coffee, soup, juice, etc. We searched for just the right steel to prevent the odor and taste sticking to the bottle. We found it in 18/8 stainless steel.

<p><u><strong>The design of bottle and lid was also a challenge. </strong></u>We knew that we wanted to make it easier to customize without making additional purchases.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The bidet (also called a Lota) is, for all intents and purposes, superior to toilet paper when it comes to cleaning yourself in the bathroom. The facts are clear:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using a bidet is more hygienic than using toilet paper</li>
<li>Using a bidet is eco-friendly</li>
<li>Using a bidet is cost-effective</li>
</ul>
<p>  Introducing the GoLota:</p>

<h3>Product Features:</h3>
<p>The GoLota features a collapsable silicone top that allows it to fold small enough to fit in the smallest of spaces.  Supported by its sturdy base, the GoLota can hold up to 2 liters of water.  The GoLota will come with a carrying case that will allow it to be separated from your belongings and make it convenient to carry.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The majority of people in the world use water when they go the bathroom. However, there are still countries, such as the United States, where bidets are little-heard-of.

For over twenty years I have dreamed of an organic farm where people can vacation with their families and have a great time.I have worked hard in the last six years to save money for the farm. I recently sold a successful remodeling business and was able to buy the perfect farm!The farm has million dollar views and has water so clean, you can drink right out of the creeks on the farm. ( By the way, there are two creeks like that on the farm.) It is located on the northern most Fjord in northern Patagonia. I know it might sound like  a cliché, but Patagonia is truly a magical place. It is one of the last unspoiled areas in the world and it is incredibly beautiful. It really should be on your bucket list to visit.This is what you see from the farm.Looking over the farm. Makes you  just want to sit down and relax.The farm also is right on the water so boating and fishing is available at the farm. There is about 750 feet of shoreline. At the top of the farm is a national forest that goes up to the top of a snow capped mountain. It is  near a valley called Cochamo valley which is known as the Yosemite of Chile. When you come to vacation, we can take you there!Less than twenty miles from the farm are two national parks, Alerce Andino and Hornopiren.  There is also a private park called Parque Tagua Tagua in the area. I'm not great at photography, but I have a few pics of the area for you here. If you look up any of these parks or Cochamo valley on Instagram, you can get  better pics of the area.Nearby Puelo River. Beautiful and great for catching salmon and trout.Did I mention the fishing in the area? Within a few miles of the farm is Puelo river. It is known for it's great trout and salmon fishing. There are numerous lakes in the area, that are good for fishing. And of course salt water fishing is also available right at the farm!One of the first views as you enter Cochamo Valley. Another of the many great views in Cochamo valley. One of the lakes near our farm, called Lago Tagua Tagua, is turquoise blue and has a 90 foot waterfall flowing into it that you can kayak under.Now I want to raise money to build cabins and develop the farm. I want to buy a boat, build a zipline on the farm, buy horses (so you can go horseback riding), other animals and so much more.If we raise enough money, I would love to have a helicopter and a ride in it would be included with your vacation. In addition, I think it would be really cool to raise enough money to get a submarine for you to take an underwater tour in. I also would love to be able to put on shows in the evening. I think it would be neat to have drama productions, music, maybe a mystery dinner theater, and have movie night under the stars. I want to provide the greatest vacation you have ever had!A giant Alerce tree in Cochamo valley.If you can help me raise the money I need, you can get a vacation at a large discount. Help me make my dream come true and I want to share this great place with you!Do you want to see the farm and surrounding area right now?To see the farm and area on google earth, go here .We need to raise at least $75,000 and you can get a great vacation for contributing toward our goal!I set the initial goal at $75,000 because it will take that much for me to be able to build one cabin and provide what I need to start hosting people at our farm. I made it a fixed goal rather than flexible, because I don't want to take anyone's money unless I know I can deliver on my promises.I would really like to raise more than that so that I can develop even more things for people to enjoy while vacationing at our farm. I want to be able to serve the best food to my guests.  I want to take people fishing, hiking, horseback riding, sightseeing and much more!Our featured perk is for you to be able to become a founding member of God's Country. It costs less than $50 and has great benefits! As a founding member you get-A t-shirt with our logo-A 2019 calendar, (The calendar will feature views from our farm and surrounding area, Chilean holidays, joke of the week, and quote of the month.)-$300 off any vacation you book with us - Your name on our founding wall to see when you come down-You will get access to the founding member web page with our latest recipes and how we do things, like build a zip line or ninja course.! Any perk that is priced higher than $50 will also include a founding membership. So don't be afraid to choose a higher priced perk if you want to!Another perk will be a vacation for four people that will be all-inclusive except for the airfare. We will pick you up at the airport and bring you to our farm. We will provide all lodging, food and entertainment for 7 days. We will try to plan things for you that you like to do.For instance, if you like to fish, your wife likes to relax, and your kids like to hike, we will do our best to accommodate each person in your family to do what they love! We will even provide some child care services if you and your wife just need some alone time. Our goal is to make this the greatest vacation of your life.When I say we provide your food, I mean that we do all of the cooking. Personally, I love to cook and I have a lot of specialties that I'm confident you will love.These vacations are at a huge discount! (Shoot, buy ten, they make great Christmas gifts!)I want to build very nice two bedroom, two bath cabins for people to stay in.I want to raise natural fresh organic food for people to enjoy while they are on the farm. I want to tailor your vacation to your interests while you are here!If camping and hiking are what you love to do, there is an option for that! You can choose a very reasonably priced vacation to go camping for a week. These vacations are initially for two people, but you can add extra people for only $275 per extra person. We will pick you up at the Puerto Montt airport and bring you to our farm. We will provide you with a tent, sleeping bags, backpacks and other items for camping.We will also provide your food for the week, but in this option, you can either choose trail type of food or food that you can cook over a campfire. You can stay at the farm or we will take you to your choice of excursions for you to go hiking.There are two national parks within 15 miles of our farm, there is Cochamo valley nearby which is called the Yosemite of Chile, and Tagua Tagua Park is also nearby. It is a private park that requires advance notice to visit. The whole area is breathtakingly beautiful!If you are not able to fund a full vacation at this time, you can donate a lessor amount for a huge discount on a vacation later. This discount will not have an expiration date.We need to enjoy real food again!I think we have gotten too far away from where our food really comes from. It is my opinion that many of the diseases like cancer and heart disease happen to us because of our American diet. Our food is so full of chemicals and too processed for our bodies to be truly healthy!By supporting my campaign, you can help me to teach people how good real food can taste. I want to provide a place where people can get back to nature and enjoying all of God's creation in it's purest form. I want to provide food grown right on the farm.I make the best homemade salsa and guacamole. When you taste it, I think you'll agree!I've built and sold one successful business. Now I want to build a business of helping people to have a lot of fun, while getting healthy again.A piece of my delicious fruit pizza sweetened with maple syrup and honey.Your help with my campaign will make it possible for you and others to enjoy the beauty of nature and to eat some of the healthiest food there is.Just to prove I was there.I know I have my work cut out for me.It will take a couple months of work to build the cabins and get the farm ready.

OnPark Find 3 is an electric longboard with dual brushless hub motors, whose speed is up to 31 MPH within 23 KM on a single battery, so boring routines will become exhilarating adventures. 
High-Quality & Quickly Disassemble Samsung Battery
Best skateboard deck material - bamboo and two layers of glass fiber
2.4G RF Wireless Smart Remote Control
100 mm Swappable Dual Hub Motors
8-inch Wide Bridge
Multi-colored LED Light for Night Riders
   The swappable function makes it easy to change the battery after the battery life ends. On the other hand, it also makes it possible to travel in a long distance if you carry a back-up battery during your trip. We select a high-quality Samsung 25R high-rate battery that has 1000 cycles of battery life. The capacity is 5A/h, and means you can use up the battery 1000 times but still has the most capacity of your battery. Powered by a high-performance 1360W hub motor, OnPark Find 3 gives you strong brake, fast acceleration, and steep hill climbing. The hub motor can store electricity when it's on the downhill and convert part of the potential energy to electric energy and avoid damage to the motor caused by overload. Reaching a speed of 15 mph and climbing 30° hills, OnPark  Find 3 is perfect for users looking for a powerful yet affordable way to get around. The integrated sensor system allows you to quickly accelerate, brake in an instant and even go reverse. As soon as you step off your OnPark Find 3 the sensors will activate the braking system instantaneously to make sure that you are safe and to keep your board within reach. Just by slowing down, our regenerative braking automatically adds an average of a 10% range.On OnPark Find 3 hub motor is chosen over belt motor for several reasons. As most electric skateboard users know, belt motor can provide more torque which can generate higher acceleration. However, the belt motor needs frequent maintenance and makes loud noise during cruising. The hub motors are quieter and more energy-efficient. Those motors on OnPark Find 3 are also swappable. When the outside layer wears out, you can easily change it without changing the entire motor which is much more expensive. We also include a different size spare pair of wheels in the package.   OnPark Find 3’s electric skateboard deck is made of bamboo and two layers of glass fiber which is the best skateboard deck material in the industry. The combination makes a balance between flexibility and strength. The shape of the deck is designed for more comfort and stability. It is extremely flexible and suitable for all kinds of riding conditions.Differing from a traditional skateboard -which cannot change speed,  OnPark Find 3 has four modes:  Novice, Standard, Advanced and Pro, which make switching speeds possible. Making this skateboard suitable for beginners, enthusiasts and professional riders. OnPark Find 3 is simple to use, efficient, and exhilarating to ride.Onpark Find 3 was joined the fixed speed cruise function - free your hands.On our LED display system, you can display the driving speed,  skateboard power, remote control power, real-time current, single mileage, total mileage, riding mode, break mode, and signal connection status in real-time. Creative structural design not only means you can ride the OnPark Find 3 smoothly and safely at high speeds, a clever melding of sci-fi looks and it’s slim, fashionable appearance clearly displays its reliability, carefully conceived quality and oozes futuristic character.  OnPark Find 3 is ready to go everywhere.

It fits perfectly to your keys or lanyard without adding extra bulk, each edge precision honed to create a minimal yet functional tool. Finding your keys too bulky already? Use the PYK's bag / belt hook to securely fasten it to your person. SPECIFICATIONS  Measuring 85mm from end to end, the PYK has been designed to be sleek and unobtrusive during daily use. Precision machined and featuring a brushed finish, the PYK's sharp contours are contrasted by its bevelled edging. We've also made it 5mm thick making PYK super strong and up to whatever task life throws its way. LYMB CO prides itself on providing high quality and sustainable products. Stainless steel and brass have been chosen thanks to their qualitative elemental properties as well as their recyclability allowing them to be sourced responsibly and stand the test of time.  MATERIALS The PYK has been crafted in two different metals; S420 (420L surgical grade stainless steel) & CuZn (an antimicrobial brass plated zinc-alloy). The choice is yours depending on which suits your lifestyle.   S420 is ideal for those looking for a strong and reliable multi-tool, capable of completing every day tasks whilst being corrosion and tarnish resistant. This means it easy to clean & maintain - just use, clean and forget. Commonly used in surgical tools and blades, 420 stainless steel has a high tensile strength, making it long lasting and durable.   CUZN is perfect for use as a touch-tool with its anti-microbial properties.  Interact with doors and public touch points without the use of your hands, and let PYK's brass surface disinfect itself within hours*. Brass is also naturally corrosion resistant and will develop a beautiful patina over time. We have selected a brass alloy with a high zinc content to ensure that the CUZN is strong enough to use as a multi-tool whilst still maintaining its intrinsic anti-microbial properties. WHY BRASS?  Copper and its alloys (including brass) are naturally anti-microbial materials that have been used for thousands of years for their beneficial properties. It has been scientifically proven that copper kills more than 99.97% of microbes within 2 hours. It is widely used - on door fittings to hospital fixtures -as it is observed by the scientific community to effectively fight the spread of harmful microbes such as bacteria and viruses. How does copper kill bacteria and viruses? When a microbe makes contact with copper surfaces, it absorbs copper's electrically charged ions, which destroy the cells genetic material, killing it and preventing it from mutating or replicating. According to many studies, this process sees the lifespan of microbes on surfaces reduced from several days in most cases to approximately 2 hours.  This anti-microbial property also extends in what is observed as a ""halo-effect"", due to the unstable nature of copper ions. Studies show that adjacent surfaces to a copper object exhibit 70% less contamination than would otherwise be expected due to their proximity to copper ions. Copper is safe to touch, being found in many foods we eat, and is actually essential in assisting with the production of red blood cells. Having PYK on your keys or in your bag may help reduce the efficacy of germs and bacteria contaminating your essentials. * DISCLAIMER: We do not claim that PYK will cure, treat, or prevent any specific illness or condition, and encourage the use of good personal hygiene practices as well as following the latest medical advice. 15+ FUNCTION MULTI TOOL  In addition to its uses as a touch tool, PYK has been thoughtfully designed to serve as an all in one multi tool. We researched a wide variety of the most useful everyday tools and combined as many as possible into one slimline package. More than 15 different tools with countless functions have all been incorporated into the PYK's design, meaning it is the only EDC you will ever need.   From a flat-head screwdriver to a bottle opener, PYK is sure to come in handy when you are stuck with just your essentials and need to complete a task. PYK has also been designed so that it is travel and aircraft safe, making it the perfect companion on trips. INCLUDED WITH THE PYK:

We need your backing to help us cover the tooling costs and minimum order quantities outlined by our manufacturers to bring PYK to life. With your help PYK can change the way we live & interact with the world around us.  See below the timeline outlined for our campaign...  We have followed the journey of many crowdfunding campaigns and understand that while setbacks and delays are inevitable, transparency and open communication are essential in a positive experience. The schedule outlined above is extremely generous in its time-frames, allowing for further prototyping, delays in manufacturing, and padded out shipping estimates to account for the global situation.  LYMB CO endeavours to stick to this timeline whilst updating backers weekly on progress and developments. We have an ongoing relationship with our manufacturer and are confident in both the quality of their work and their commitment to delivering on time. We will be fulfilling all orders from our studio in Melbourne, Australia, but will be monitoring the response to this campaign to decide if alternative fulfilment is optimal.   We hope that you share our belief in the difference that PYK can make to the lives of so many people around the world. With your backing you can help us bring this project to life. Feel free to follow us on social media below where we will be posting regular updates in tandem with the campaign. There is also more information regarding PYK on our website...http://www.lymbco.com.auFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/lymbcoInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/lymb.coYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgCg4TD3uPa4CXPGLZfqMLQ",17.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>BRIIDGS was built on the belief that traveling should be easy. We set out to create a weekender bag that was built to serve both the frequent flier and the first-time explorer. It fits everything you might need for trip to San Francisco or Las Vegas and is designed to fit as your carry-on of all major airlines, ensuring that you get to your destination while avoiding the hassle of checking-in luggage and fitting under your airline. And while designing amazing backpacks is important, we want to make the travel experience better, for everyone. For every backpack purchase, we donate a bag of goods to displaced persons. Whether it be Hurricane Harvey victims or Syrian refugees, we believe everyone has the right to travel with ease.</p>
<p>Come join us and find your journey.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Risks and challenges</p>
<p>We believe communication and planning is key when developing a product. We have spent nearly 2 yearly testing and perfecting our design with 12 prototypes made. Each sample was field tested for durability, functionality, and style over a variety of weekend trips like a trips. We even tested taking two Travel Packs (one backpack + one duffle) on a 2 week trip to Colombia. They held up we great and learned a ton about our product.</p>
<p>A challenge we had with our branding was picking a perfect brand name that resonated with our mission and audience. We decided to go with BRIIDG Supply Co. because we wanted to connect with displaced people on a global level for those that may have lost it all for reasons beyond there control. From victims of the California Wildfires and Hurricane Harvey here at home to the refugees from Syria and the Rohingya people in Bangladesh, we want to bring awareness to the struggles they face while also helping out to the best we can.</p>

That is until fate gave me the chance to travel- and that changed my life. <strong>Travel became my life and as I grow older and as my list of destinations grow, I meet more wonderful people and enjoy more experiences. Little by little, I'm starting to understand and connect with the real meaning of LIFE.</strong> And I still have a long journey to go. <i>I hope that more people will start their travel journey too by going out of their comfort zones, exploring and finding their purpose.</i></p><p>Being a traveler is easy. But the question is, <strong>what makes you different? Who are you? What can you contribute in this world? </strong> I founded a small group of travel enthusiasts and we started a prototype to reinvent the way people  travel in which they will not just do the typical travel to observe and sightsee, but to<strong> travel to find purpose in life, learn, and give hope.</strong> The first design prototype was for individuals, couples and a small group of people. We followed a design for groups minimum of 30 people where there are activities to boost their SOUL, MIND, BRAIN AND BODY in which they will not just enjoy and learn something valuable but also connect with people.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1509682598/evzmxhrgllvxodga5isi.png"" src=""""/></p><p>There are around 200 people who successfully completed the prototypes and around 300 people who attended our events and seminars in under one year. the prototype was really successful!

It was a good offer and more than enough money to pay for all the necessities to expand. However, having some experiences in investments, I've realized that having an investor is the same as borrowing money with high interest. My partner and I decided not to have any investors as we don't want to have any debts and obligations. If we can do it ourselves without asking for a huge amount of money from someone, then why not do it just ourselves.

<p>Taking it to the next level for us means building the legitimacy of the business and reaching more people. It will only happen if we hire professionals or companies who will: </p>
<p><strong>1.) Process the business papers and permits so we could start paying taxes and fullfil our obligation as citizens. </strong></p>
<p><strong>2.) Build and design our website and social media accounts so it will look more pleasing and professional. </strong></p>
<p><strong>3.) Manage our social media and SEO so we could reach more people.</strong></p>
<p><strong>4.) Create an automated software for the manual system that we are currently using to process all projects/events and as well as the quotations and bookings of our clients. </strong></p>
<p>Our minimum estimated cost for these is 10,000.00$ that includes 5% Indiegogo cut and other fees and as well as the actual booking costs of the raffle draws<i>(see perks)</i>. Sometimes, there are things that you really can't achieve or it is not yet the right time; if we don't reach our campaign's goal, we will still use whatever amount of funds we were able to raise for improvement of the business. The business will still continue its operations and you can still book with us your future travels! </p>
<p> If in case we reached more than the campaign's goal,funds will proceed on the following:</p>
<p><strong>5.) Renovate our proposed office so we could have a decent space where we could accept and assist clients physically</strong></p>

That is until fate gave me the chance to travel- and that changed my life. Travel became my life and as I grow older and as my list of destinations grow, I meet more wonderful people and enjoy more experiences. Little by little, I'm starting to understand and connect with the real meaning of LIFE. And I still have a long journey to go. I hope that more people will start their travel journey too by going out of their comfort zones, exploring and finding their purpose.Being a traveler is easy. But the question is, what makes you different? Who are you? What can you contribute in this world?  I founded a small group of travel enthusiasts and we started a prototype to reinvent the way people  travel in which they will not just do the typical travel to observe and sightsee, but to travel to find purpose in life, learn, and give hope. The first design prototype was for individuals, couples and a small group of people. We followed a design for groups minimum of 30 people where there are activities to boost their SOUL, MIND, BRAIN AND BODY in which they will not just enjoy and learn something valuable but also connect with people.There are around 200 people who successfully completed the prototypes and around 300 people who attended our events and seminars in under one year. the prototype was really successful! I, as a travel entrepreneur, have been published by some of the world's largest media companies such as BuzzFeed and Huffington Post! Today, the team wants to take it to the next level. We want our voice- our mission and vision: a world with PEACE, HOPE and NO BOUNDARIES, to be heard not just in Manila, not just the Philippines but the whole world! I had this idea to expand TRAVEL-REINVENTED to the next level when an investor asked to buy 50% income share of this business. It was a good offer and more than enough money to pay for all the necessities to expand. However, having some experiences in investments, I've realized that having an investor is the same as borrowing money with high interest. My partner and I decided not to have any investors as we don't want to have any debts and obligations. If we can do it ourselves without asking for a huge amount of money from someone, then why not do it just ourselves. Hence, this campaign was born.Know more about the prototype at www.travelinnovations.org/about watch some of our successful group prototypes below  to have a glimpse on what we are doing in this world :)





I've never asked anyone for anything for myself... But I've learned that asking for help and support is not a bad thing. I am not asking for your money nor donations. I am asking for your support. Support to help me serve my mission and purpose in life and for you to experience what I and my small company could offer. 
Supporting this campaign also means you support in giving HOPE to people. If this campaign succeeds, I will have more privilege to reach more people in the world- to share my life story, inspire them and give hope, that even after all the struggles that I've been through in my life, I still managed to get up and build a beautiful life. If I can and I did, they could too!
""When you buy from a small business, you are not helping a CEO buy their 3rd vacation home. You are helping a little girl get dance lessons, a little boy get his team jersey, a mom put food on the table a dad pay mortgage or a student pay for college"" This is true indeed! You are not just supporting me and my team, you will also be able to help our employees feed their family as they would be the one fixing and assisting you on your travel bookings(see ""TRAVEL PACKAGE DISCOUNT"" perks).  
Not only that, you will not just become an instrument to achieve our mission and vision, you will also be an instrument to help unprivileged children because for every 50$ that this campaign will reach, we will give 1 book to 1 child in an isolated destinations in the Philippines-soon in the whole world- where children don't have access to proper education. 

You can support us by sharing this campaign in your social media accounts or sharing the word to your colleagues, bosses, family and friends. Get the word out and make some noise about this travel innovation! You can support by joining some of our travel events or getting some of our travel-reinvented packages and other perks so we could start changing your life. 

Interested to be part of our team? Tell us why you want to be part of us and what skills you could offer to achieve our mission and vision. Email your answers to jeyvie@dlcbackpackers.com

Taking it to the next level for us means building the legitimacy of the business and reaching more people. It will only happen if we hire professionals or companies who will: 
1.) Process the business papers and permits so we could start paying taxes and fullfil our obligation as citizens. 
2.) Build and design our website and social media accounts so it will look more pleasing and professional. 
3.) Manage our social media and SEO so we could reach more people.
4.) Create an automated software for the manual system that we are currently using to process all projects/events and as well as the quotations and bookings of our clients. 
Our minimum estimated cost for these is 10,000.00$ that includes 5% Indiegogo cut and other fees and as well as the actual booking costs of the raffle draws(see perks). Sometimes, there are things that you really can't achieve or it is not yet the right time; if we don't reach our campaign's goal, we will still use whatever amount of funds we were able to raise for improvement of the business. The business will still continue its operations and you can still book with us your future travels! 
 If in case we reached more than the campaign's goal,funds will proceed on the following:
5.) Renovate our proposed office so we could have a decent space where we could accept and assist clients physically
6.) Future company improvements hoping that one day, I will be able to reach my dream for my team- to bring the whole team in other country and hold an event there.

<p align=""center""><i>Shot in Ex-Yu deserted military base / airport in Zaton, Croatia, 2016</i></p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Short Summary Of A Journey Of A Lifetime</h2>
<p>I am a man who was given a name Nikica by the names of my both grandfathers who were both called Nikola. Just recently St. Nicholas was celebrated in Croatia &amp; he is a protector of travelers too. Due to my name &amp; my vocation as a traveler along with my Twingo, there surely ain’t no end to my voyage!</p>
<p>Twingo is kind of a cult car which was made to last long &amp; very rarely breaks down but even if it breaks down it’s not so expansive to repair it! My Twingo &amp; me are together since the early 2016 &amp; in the middle of the same year it drove me on the long way from Croatia to Bulgaria. On that voyage I made a lot of photos on which we posed together. Some of these photos along with the texts were posted on several web sites &amp; exposed to a large number of people (links to these posts you can find in this document).</p>
<p>I am mostly interested in natural &amp; cultural heritage of the people &amp; the countries I’m planning to visit. Most of all I like combining those two in an unbreakable oneness of unity, cause almost always nature of some place/area defines its people’s culture. But the process can be completely the opposite: Culture effects the nature too!</p>
<p>So, I’ll be visiting the local traditional &amp; underground events of art &amp; culture like: concerts, parties, exhibitions, celebrations, street parades, etc. I will also try to get involved in those happenings contacting &amp; meeting the people in charge – the organizers of all these activities to participate directly &amp; actively in them. I hope in collaborating with other artists on the way… In every activity I which I manage to get involved, I will try my best to document it with photos &amp; videos!</p>
<p>I’ll be exploring the natural beauties everywhere around &amp; learning about the local naturally growing wild plants &amp; mushrooms &amp; picking them if it would be the right time. In these activities my Twingo will surely help me by driving me here &amp; there, from the sea level to the high mountain peaks, from the ferry boats in urban environments to the off road sights of the natural jewels! I’ll also be volunteering in projects if I sense &amp; recognize that somewhere my help is needed! As usual, I will surely continue to play music in the streets of many different cities I visit!</p>
<p>Every day I’ll try my best to record &amp; edit videos, shoot photos &amp; write texts &amp; report about everything happening to me. These reports will be visible on several pages where I regularly interact with public every day &amp; there you will be able to follow my travel progress! I can assure you that you’ll be witnessing one unique, unusual &amp; exciting travel experience!</p>
<p>Why did I decided to travel with my personal car – Renault Twingo? Mainly cause of the practical reasons: Till now, I had only positive experiences with it. It took me everywhere I wanted to go. The longest distance was my trip to Bulgaria in 2016 when I passed the Croatian coastline of Dalmatia &amp; several islands, Monte Negro, Kosovo, Macedonia, Bulgaria, Serbia &amp; back home – altogether approx. 3 700 km – on this distance it broke down only once &amp; it was the gas pump &amp; when we changed it, Twingo was ready to fly again! It gives me a higher level of independence in moving around, carrying all of my work equipment (drums, laptop, photo-video gadgets…) &amp; other luggage. It’s giving me the opportunity to give someone a lift if needed. I’ll be also offering a lift over the car sharing apps &amp; sites!</p>
<p>I calculated that I will pass 10 648 km in total starting from Croatia &amp; passing through Slovenia, Italy, Monaco, France, Spain, Morocco (where I’ll stay the longest – 54 days), Portugal, than again Spain &amp; France, towards the North to Belgium, Netherlands, Germany, Czech Republic, Austria, Slovenia again &amp; back home. The trip will last for 163 days what is approx. 4,5 months during which I will need to eat something &amp; sleep somewhere – so that’s another reason for asking for your help! I calculated that my travel expanses will be in total of 12 535,23 €.</p>
<p>To achieve all of this I need your help – every donation is very welcomed &amp; appreciated!</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">What I Need - <strong>Financial back-up</strong>:</h2>
<p>10 684 km x 0,3 €/km + 360 € (ferry Spain-Morocco-Spain) = <strong>3 565,20 € for gas &amp; other road expanses</strong></p>
<p>163 days x 20 €/day = <strong>3 260,00 € of pocket money</strong></p>
<p>163 days x 25 €/day = <strong>4 075,00 € for accommodation</strong></p>
<p><strong>Altogether</strong>: 10 900,20 € + 15 % (insurance if anything goes out of the plan) = <strong>12 535,23 €</strong></p>
<p>I'm actually asking 7 000,00 € of the whole amount of my travel expanses but every cent exceeding the amount will be spent in achieving many of the goals of this voyage, for example for car breakdowns, designing &amp; publishing the book, editing &amp; publishing the DVD documentary, etc.</p>

The longest distance was my trip to Bulgaria in 2016 when I passed the Croatian coastline of Dalmatia & several islands, Monte Negro, Kosovo, Macedonia, Bulgaria, Serbia & back home – altogether approx. 3 700 km – on this distance it broke down only once & it was the gas pump & when we changed it, Twingo was ready to fly again! It gives me a higher level of independence in moving around, carrying all of my work equipment (drums, laptop, photo-video gadgets…) & other luggage. It’s giving me the opportunity to give someone a lift if needed. I’ll be also offering a lift over the car sharing apps & sites!
I calculated that I will pass 10 648 km in total starting from Croatia & passing through Slovenia, Italy, Monaco, France, Spain, Morocco (where I’ll stay the longest – 54 days), Portugal, than again Spain & France, towards the North to Belgium, Netherlands, Germany, Czech Republic, Austria, Slovenia again & back home. The trip will last for 163 days what is approx. 4,5 months during which I will need to eat something & sleep somewhere – so that’s another reason for asking for your help! I calculated that my travel expanses will be in total of 12 535,23 €.
To achieve all of this I need your help – every donation is very welcomed & appreciated!

What I Need - Financial back-up:
10 684 km x 0,3 €/km + 360 € (ferry Spain-Morocco-Spain) = 3 565,20 € for gas & other road expanses
163 days x 20 €/day = 3 260,00 € of pocket money
163 days x 25 €/day = 4 075,00 € for accommodation
Altogether: 10 900,20 € + 15 % (insurance if anything goes out of the plan) = 12 535,23 €
I'm actually asking 7 000,00 € of the whole amount of my travel expanses but every cent exceeding the amount will be spent in achieving many of the goals of this voyage, for example for car breakdowns, designing & publishing the book, editing & publishing the DVD documentary, etc.
What You Get / What Do I Offer - In Return?

To Donors:

As I am a president of NGO Akt (https://www.facebook.com/udruga.akt/) where many of our members produce different handmade accessories (woolen clothes - caps, scarfs, sweaters, gloves, socks, jewelry, bags...), there will be a rich perk program for donors! (more info under ""perks"") For almost each donation, a handmade item will be sent to your home address!
Some of the perks will be in the form of a copy of the book & / or a copy of a DVD documentary about the voyage which will be sent to your home address for free!
Every donor will be listed in my Google Contacts (if wanted) & will be receiving a newsletter of every step of my voyage (optional).

To Sponsors:
PLATINUM SPONSORSHIP - 1 000,00 €

GOLDEN SPONSORSHIP - 700,00 €

SILVER SPONSORSHIP - 500,00 €

BRONZE SPONSORSHIP - 300,00 €

If you choose to be a sponsor, goodwill about your sponsorship will be heard far & wide!

If you choose to be a donor, you will be able to experience & live through all of my adventures like you are travelling with me cause I'll do my best to give you the best materials to enjoy in them & you'll be the first to know about them! (& don't forget to see the perks!)
In both cases, if you become a sponsor or a donor, you will enable my goals come true! These goals are not only of my personal growth to gain experience in life cause due to my acts along the way you will also enable connecting of people, nations & mixing of their cultures reaching a higher mutual respect. I'll be spreading only the messages of love, peace, unity & respect. I'll put a special accent on ecology (even thou Twingo is powered by gas) & respecting the natural wealth all around us, together with all the other living creatures by promoting the vegetarian diet. The journey will have educational & artistic purpose too! As I said before, I'll get involved in the local artistic programs as much as possible & surely be studying about the new edible & medicinal species of plants & mushrooms & be presenting them to the world!

Risks & Challenges
I'm always trying to think positively but there are always possibilities of troubles. The first way to cope with troubles & problems is to not to think about them cause your thoughts can materialize! So, I have no particular plans for coping with any particular problem cause there's not gonna be any! If still any problem / trouble turns up, I won't approaching it as it is a problem or a trouble! It's just a test.

Other Ways You Can Help
If you can't back me up with the financial resources, you can help me in many different ways:
1. You can share this campaign among your friends who maybe have some spare finances & are ready to support these kind of adventures.
2. You can host me somewhere on my journey if I'm passing close / through your town.
3. Engage me to make photography on some event in your town or to record a video, to perform music on a festival or whatever goes through your mind! Present me your idea, so that I can see if I like it & would want to join your project!
4. Maybe you have some other idea which can help me on my voyage & in the same time I can help you with something else?!

They decided to combine both of their passions of snowboarding and teaching people with disabilities to create Ride de Vuelta with the ambition to provide everyone equal opportunities to learn these incredible sports and to experience amazing places in Chile while providing absolute quality and safe services.</span><br/>

</div></div>","Ride de Vuelta is one of the first premier inclusive adventure travel companies that focus on providing snowboard and surf classes, courses and tours to the general public but with a focus on people with different disabilities.  Mick Jackson who is from California and the founder of Ride de Vuelta has been to Chile several times during his snowboard career.  As of three years ago, Mick decided to move to Chile after meeting Carolina Gonzalez, a former special education teacher from the Institution of Teresiana in Santiago. They decided to combine both of their passions of snowboarding and teaching people with disabilities to create Ride de Vuelta with the ambition to provide everyone equal opportunities to learn these incredible sports and to experience amazing places in Chile while providing absolute quality and safe services.


With the Southern Hemisphere snow season right around the corner, we have discovered an innovative snowboard rig from Dutch start-up Prodaptive that can transform access to the winter sport. The state-of-the-art Twinrider rig offers people without use of their lower body full control of their snowboard, providing them with a truly independent riding experience.
We look to incorporate this innovative tool into our service in 2015 to provide people with disabilities the opportunity to experience something they never thought possible. 
These rigs will allow Ride de Vuelta to break barriers and enable people to build self-esteem by achieving demanding goals, learning from adversity and being part of a group effort.  We have already seen firsthand how people’s lives can change with this leaning experience and with these products and your support we can trigger a paradigmatic change allowing more people with disabilities to enjoy Chile’s the slopes and debunking myths that a person's disability prevents them from learning how to ride. 
We all can do it!
What We Need 
 Ride de Vuelta requires $10,000 US to purchase two adaptive snowboards for the upcoming snow season.  One is for adults and the other is for children ages 9+. We want to be the first to provide this wonderful learning opportunity in Chile.  Let's make it happen!
What You Get
Perks you ask? Set your faces to stunned!
1.)  $10.00: Free tip on how to snowboard or surf.
2.)  $25.00: A photo of the first day with the lucky person riding the product.
3.)  $50.00:  A photo of the first day with lucky person riding the product along with a signature from one of our professional Chilean snowboard athletes.
4.)  $100.00: A Ride de Vuelta T-shirt and a Thank You card.
5.)  $250.00:  We will provide 2 trips free for 2 people with different disabilities to use the product and send you a signed photo of them using the product.
6.)  $500.00:  One free snowboard trip with Ride de Vuelta and a Ride de Vuelta T-shirt.
7.)  $1,000.00:  2 day snowboard course in Chile with Ride de Vuelta  and a Ride de Vuelta T-shirt.
    Impact
The impact will be ferocious. There are very few opportunities for people to utilize adaptive sports equipment in Chile and it is Ride de Vuelta's vision that everyone has the opportunity to participate.  We aim to make it happen by being the first in Chile to provide this adaptive snowboard machine for peope with disabilities and demonstrating that everyone has the ability to join in.

OUR STORY
Mick Jackson, California native and founder of Ride de Vuelta, visited Chile several times during his snowboarding career and as of 2012 calls the South American nation his home.  After meeting Carolina Gonzalez, a special education teacher at the Teresiana Institute in Santiago, they decided to combine their passion for snowboarding, surfing and teaching people with disabilities to set up Ride de Vuelta in 2014. Their goal is to promote social inclusion by providing unified opportunities to experience these incredible sports and to experience amazing places in Chile. 
Over the past year Ride de Vuelta has had the privilege of working with many amazing people with and without disabilities and has seen how these sports can dramatically improve the quality of ones' life. 
We have provided an abundant amount of pro-bono snowboard classes, courses and tours for people with disabilities throughout Chile in a unified environment with family and friends.  We have even given lessons to Paralympian Athletes such as   gold medalists Juan Carlos Garrido.
We are also in the process of organizing Chile’s very first snowboard championship forpeople with disabilities with the participation of professional snowboard athletes.
Not only this, Ride de Vuelta is also developing a program to take students from low income families to the mountains for one weekend during the season each month to teach them how to snowboard along with many other activities.  
Ride de Vuelta has even been feature in various newspapers and on the radio and is constantly in the process of discovering new ideas to provide everyone the opportunity to learn how to snowboard along with the therapeutic advantages involved.

Our Challenge

One of the biggest challenges we face is that there is very little funding and support these types of initiatives.  However, our objective is to demonstrate the emotional benefit gained by participating in something was never thought possible and to encourage those around to do the same in order to strengthen understanding, community and appreciation for diversity.

</p><p>What would you do with an old hotel that
stands at the highest mountain-port in the Pyrenees (southern Europe) at 2400m high (8,000 ft)
and needs a complete refurbishment after 30 years of running it during the
winter seasons under severe weather conditions and with low year-long profitability?<br/></p>
<p>What would you do it there is also an
increasing demand for practising all year long countless types of mountain
sports that provides excellent aerobic conditions and high altitude acclimatization
like sky-running, ski touring, mountaineering and climbing, road and off-road
mountain biking, swimming in altitude and alike?</p>
<p>Hi, my name is Pierino and I'm a confirmed entrepreneur expert in marketing and strategy that loves disruptive business models. I'm passionate of nature, photography, adventure sports and traveling.<br/></p><p>I want to completely refurbish this
100-room hotel and turn it into the most energy efficient and sustainable construction
with key improvements in all areas including water collection and re-use, thermal insulation, electricity efficiency, and the set up of top renewable energy technology. I’m talking about turning this
energy and resources-glutton building, into a water supply and energy independent hotel
(known as a “passive building”), dropping its environmental footprint from
current untenable levels to nil, but keeping higher than expected comfort
standards. The project will be a prototype that can be replicated to any other
mountain guesthouse.</p>
<p>The site is perfect for outdoor activities.
In summer there is off-road biking, trekking or trail racing (GR11.7 crossing
right there and GR7 not far away), high performance mountain cycling like the
“Purito” race (currently the hardest in the Pyrenees), and the possibility to
organise the most exciting competitions in this mountain range, not to forget
high-altitude accommodation for any mountaineer willing to acclimatize and
train before any serious climb. Any mountain geek will be delighted with the
calmness and enchantment of the area. In winter it sits on top of the biggest
skiing resort in this range and one of the biggest in Europe, and is perfect
for ski touring, snowshoes hiking, excursions in snowmobiles or even snow
driving and watching the car races on ice Trophy “Andros” in the nearby
Andorran Circuit for speed lovers. Great fun! </p>
<p>At 2400m high with snow up to second floor during the winter, log fires and spectacular views, the hotel will deliver an outstanding mountain experience. However this isolation means the building has been damaged by use and extreme weather conditions. It urges an entire refurbishment and a new market orientation.<br/></p><p>This fundraising part will cover the first
stage of the project: completing the draft that will pre-design the future
premises and confirm the final project’s projection. Then another fundraising
campaign will be launched to get the necessary funds to start with the retrofit
works. 
Seen the complexity of the project is clear that I will carry it out with
a team of experts in each field, contacts that I already have: a team of architects specialized in energy
renovation and bioclimatic architecture, an expert in organizing sports events
and an expert group in hotel operation.</p>
<p>So this is my project, my visions and my
legacy. Turning a unique high mountain old hotel into a reference in mountain
sports following an energy efficiency and sustainability retrofit program.
Besides it will also offer new and outstanding outdoor activities so that
anybody can discover new experiences and, of course, the magic of this place.
Your very welcome contribution will prevent the building to become another
mountain wreck before long.</p>

</div></div>","We know that some of the best memories are created after dark. Designed to capture the pulse of nightlife, the Next Selfie Stick has a built-in light, helping you get the most out of your night experience. To activate the flashlight just push the button. With 1000 Lumes, you can be sure that the flash you get from this selfie stick is more than enough life to see it all in your pictures. Night clubs, here we come! Moreover, the flashlight has a two hour battery life with a one-hour charge time w/ USB charger.Another challenge we are facing today is the constantly dying battery of our smart phones. You may have had the intention of charging your device, and may not realize you didn’t until your phone dies in the middle of a fabulous selfie – don’t let it happen again! The Next selfie stick is promptly equipped with a 2600 mAh power bank to make sure you can charge your devices any time any place. The Next Selfie Stick takes the guesswork out of how to capture a group selfie to ensure complete selfie freedom! The sticky mount allows you to attach the Next Selfie Stick to just about anything. Using Bluetooth technology, you can get the perfect picture no matter where you are or who you are with. Even when your phone or GoPro sticks on the window, the lights can be controlled from a 10 meter distance by pushing the button on the remote.


The Next Selfie Stick is demountable since most selfies are taken on the go. We call this the activity mode because in this size the stick is perfect for outdoor activity, city hopping and filming your favorite festival! We specially made this ''activity mode'' to make sure you can bring this selfie stick everywhere with you, even when the normal selfie stick isn't allowed.







It also fits phones of every type – and your GoPro camera – with a strong clamp that holds your phone in place. The material of the clamp is soft, so no worries about scratching the phone while it’s in the holder.



                            
  




 

















                             

We did research and talked to a lot of different people and it turned out everybody needs the Next Selfie Stick in their lives! As young people who enjoy having fun, traveling and being active, we’ve been using it every day: while doing sports,hanging out with friends, aimlessly walking in the city, on holidays, on parties, on a motorcycle (as a passenger), even while caving in the mountains. This selfie stick ensures that you can make memories – and be in the shots to prove it! We love selfies!

    
                          

                           
Let’s face it – until now, a selfie stick wasn’t exactly trendy. The Next Selfie Stick is changing that, both in the way it performs and the design of the stick. It’s simple, sleek look and functions make it a must-have for travel, parties, outdoor activity and more. In fact, it’s lightweight enough to take just about anywhere.


You don’t have to worry about easily damaging the stick – or your phone for that matter. The durability of the aluminum material of the stick makes it extra light and not prone to damage. 
The Next Selfie Stick combines four components together to solve problems we noticed using a regular selfie stick. Taking the selfie technology to the next level! 
Mobile giants like iPhone®, Android® and GoPro® have all done a great job making photos and videos way more accessible for everybody, but they are restricted by battery power, flash-light and sight reach. That’s why we’ve created the Next Selfie Stick – it is for all people who enjoy living their life to the fullest and like capturing their memories especially after dark! 


                 

So, why Indiegogo? Indiegogo rewards innovation. Period. The Next Selfie Stick takes something existing and makes it better. Everyone takes selfies and doing it with a selfie stick has become more common than ever. We just took that concept and improved it –immensely!

What’s more, it’s the revolution of the selfie stick! The only problem: production is a huge expense… If you like what you see, show us some love and pledge whatever amount you wish to make the Next Selfie Stick a reality. 











                             The selfies here are a snapshot of who we are: a group of three co-students and friends from Amsterdam, The Netherlands, blessed with a great mentor. Our love for traveling around the world and having fun brought to life the idea of this revolutionary product. We wanted a stick that was better than what we could find.

<h3>What's it all about?</h3> <p></p>
<p>You step off your flight, eager to get to the next stop on your journey. It doesn’t matter if you were on that plane for one hour or twelve. When it lands, you want off. When that door opens, you want out. The last thing you want to do is worry about missing luggage. Often, however, this is exactly what awaits the weary traveller next. Your bag has been <i>lost </i>or <i>misdirected</i>. Wherever you were going, you’re not getting there on time. You’re delayed.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1456171344/efaqscbatppvrdksyvad.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Unfortunately, losing time is the least of your worries because the real fear is never finding it again. Maybe your bag is on the next flight, maybe your belongings are sitting on a conveyor belt a thousand miles away, or maybe your luggage really is gone. The only thing you know for sure is you don't have your bag, or worse, know where it is. Until now, that is. With the introduction of <b>CarryCado</b>, the whole luggage game is about to change. Put a <b>CarryCado</b> tag in your luggage and track your belongings wherever they go. Your bag's location is now simply a button press away using the <b>CarryCado </b>smart phone app. With the FAA, CAA, and EASA approving the use of Bluetooth Low Power in all flight modes, you'll never not know the location of your bags and suitcases again.</p>

You step off your flight, eager to get to the next stop on your journey. It doesn’t matter if you were on that plane for one hour or twelve. When it lands, you want off. When that door opens, you want out. The last thing you want to do is worry about missing luggage. Often, however, this is exactly what awaits the weary traveller next. Your bag has been lost or misdirected. Wherever you were going, you’re not getting there on time. You’re delayed.


Unfortunately, losing time is the least of your worries because the real fear is never finding it again. Maybe your bag is on the next flight, maybe your belongings are sitting on a conveyor belt a thousand miles away, or maybe your luggage really is gone. The only thing you know for sure is you don't have your bag, or worse, know where it is. Until now, that is. With the introduction of CarryCado, the whole luggage game is about to change. Put a CarryCado tag in your luggage and track your belongings wherever they go. Your bag's location is now simply a button press away using the CarryCado smart phone app. With the FAA, CAA, and EASA approving the use of Bluetooth Low Power in all flight modes, you'll never not know the location of your bags and suitcases again.


Our team have been lucky enough to have travelled the world and each one of us still gets on the plane and stares out of the window looking at the bags getting loaded thinking ""I can't see mine, where is it! Oh no! they have lost it already!!!""  We are based in Scotland which usually means we often make short connections in larger airports before getting on with our journey, and we go through the whole experience again.  I always laugh at people getting off the plane and running to get to the front of the queue to collect their bags, most of whom gather around where the bags come out, pushing and sneaking into gaps.

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Why Vanlifers Need The Driftr App</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Vanlife is not just about stopping at the most photogenic places to snap a photo for Instagram, it was built on the idea of connecting like-minded vandwellers and outdoor adventure enthusiasts together in one community.</p>
<p>Being experienced vandwellers ourselves, we realized that life on the road can get lonely. We knew we were missing out on incredible experiences that could be shared with others because we had no means of finding other vanlifers nearby.</p>
<p>To us, the next logical step was to use technology and our mobile phone to quickly and efficiently connect with people in real-time.</p>
<p>Traveling solo or with a partner can be really exciting and life-changing but after a certain amount of time you desire human interaction.  With the Driftr App now we no longer need to dream of what it would be like to organize a surfer beach tailgate or a bonfire party in the bush; it can be done in minutes.</p>
<p>The size of the vanlife community is much larger than we can even imagine. This lifestyle has become a growing trend over the last few years and there are no signs of it slowing down. We want to make the driftr community an inclusive place for everyone passionate about the lifestyle. </p>
<p>Not only do we want to connect people on the road, our goal is to continue to develop ideas for the driftr app that will focus on the community and lifestyle aspects of vanlife. We hope that people who aren't necessarily vanlifers themselves can also be part of the community within the app by reading the content and connecting with driftrs to learn more about their experiences.</p>
<p>This is what vanlife means to us and we designed the Driftr App with this in mind. </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""> </h2>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">The Driftr Team</h2>
<h3>The Founders</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Hi! We are Jelena and Thibaut: your typical millennial couple. You know, the ones that meet on Tinder, spend their second date at a 3 day music festival and eventually buy a used van to renovate into their home on wheels. One of THOSE couples.  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1489420095/ffwkbdqrhhqsvfdwsb54.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>After nearly two years of dating and two years spent daydreaming of owning our own van, we had finally found the ONE. Thibaut and I joined the vanlife community in July 2016 when we adopted our first vanchild, a '93 Renault Trafic named Jean-Claude Van Dinic.</p>
<p>We quickly became addicted to the lifestyle and truly passionate about the community while on the road. However, we realized something quite quickly during our travels. It can get lonely on the road. We would arrive at a certain location and crave cracking open a beer with some new friends to chat about life on the road. But, there was no one around. Sure its great to swipe through photos on Instagram of other people doing the same thing as we were, but we wanted real human interaction. This is how the idea of Driftr App was born.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>App Developers - Hypercube </h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1489996445/ufenhsasmvqg4jewx6gm.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We have teamed up with top-notch app developers in Niš, Serbia who are helping us bring our idea to life. Established in 2013 as Hypercube LLC, they specialize in helping startups like Driftr from all over the world to create their minimum viable product (MVP), prepare it for market launch and aid in scaling. Hypercube has successfully delivered more than 50 projects, creating more than 100 iOS and Android apps with millions of users. Their success is attributed to having a well-rounded team of: 4 iOS developers, 4 Android developers, 1 QA engineer, 1 UI/UX designer, and 1 backend developer. Their diverse skills and experience allows them to take on any new idea and build it from scratch. They have been a tremendous support in helping the Driftr App team determine the possibilities and the best course of action to bring a high-quality, market-ready app to you. However, without fully funding this project, we will not be able to continue with developing the app.</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Budget Breakdown </h2>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1490003216/x2r2ynnafyojbx3hcncp.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The majority of funds will be spent on the development of the Driftr app, and on costs surrounding that development. There are also the mandatory fees to IndieGogo as well as ordering the awesome perks for you!</p>
<p>Our Goal is to raise $20,000, which gets us an iPhone app. If we raise even more than our goal, 30,000 raised gets us an Android app as well! </p>
<p>Typically a project of this magnitude would be well into six-figure range. Due to strategic partnerships and the team’s experience level, we will be able to make the driftr app with much less.</p>
<p>Funds above $30,000 will be spent on Stage II development, which includes further optimizing the application based on community feedback, improving premium features, readying the app for monetization, and sharing the app with thousands of people around the world.  </p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">How You Can Help</h2>
<h2> </h2>
<h3>1. Back the Project</h3>
<p>Make a pledge by clicking the BACK IT button above, and choose whatever reward fits you. Feel the magnitude of your pledge. You aren't just contributing to something that can be of benefit to you; you are also supporting vanlifers all over the world who want to make the community more active and attractive. Note: we cannot develop the app without this funding!</p>
<h3>2. Share Our Story</h3>
<p>Share our IndieGogo Campaign via email, Facebook, Twitter, phone calls, text messages and through old fashioned conversations. The Driftr app will continue to come to life because a community wanted and created its emergence!</p>
<h3>3. Leave Your Mark </h3>
<p>At the end of the campaign you’ll be able to tell us what kind of features and functionalities you are most looking forward to using and suggesting new ones we may have not thought of just yet. Please do this! We want to use our community feedback as an important pointer as we build the production version of the app!</p>
<p> </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Risks &amp; Challenges</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>The app developers at Hypercube are very experienced, but there will always be risks in any app development effort:</p>
<ul>
<li>This is a mobile, web, and server based software project, with all the risks normally associated with software development.</li>
<li>There are also various risks in approval and deployment from Apple that are out of our control. We do not anticipate any problems but it’s a process that we do not control.</li>
<li>Project costs and schedule estimates are the result of our evaluation of the technical and approval risks and Hypercube's deep familiarity with this type of project. There will, of course, be some unforeseen glitches, which will promptly be reported in the Updates section. We are committed to completing this project once the funding goal has been achieved, and keeping you informed every step of the way.</li>

Why Vanlifers Need The Driftr App
 
Vanlife is not just about stopping at the most photogenic places to snap a photo for Instagram, it was built on the idea of connecting like-minded vandwellers and outdoor adventure enthusiasts together in one community.
Being experienced vandwellers ourselves, we realized that life on the road can get lonely. We knew we were missing out on incredible experiences that could be shared with others because we had no means of finding other vanlifers nearby.
To us, the next logical step was to use technology and our mobile phone to quickly and efficiently connect with people in real-time.
Traveling solo or with a partner can be really exciting and life-changing but after a certain amount of time you desire human interaction.  With the Driftr App now we no longer need to dream of what it would be like to organize a surfer beach tailgate or a bonfire party in the bush; it can be done in minutes.
The size of the vanlife community is much larger than we can even imagine. This lifestyle has become a growing trend over the last few years and there are no signs of it slowing down. We want to make the driftr community an inclusive place for everyone passionate about the lifestyle. 
Not only do we want to connect people on the road, our goal is to continue to develop ideas for the driftr app that will focus on the community and lifestyle aspects of vanlife. We hope that people who aren't necessarily vanlifers themselves can also be part of the community within the app by reading the content and connecting with driftrs to learn more about their experiences.
This is what vanlife means to us and we designed the Driftr App with this in mind. 
 
The Driftr Team
The Founders
 
Hi! We are Jelena and Thibaut: your typical millennial couple. You know, the ones that meet on Tinder, spend their second date at a 3 day music festival and eventually buy a used van to renovate into their home on wheels. One of THOSE couples.  

After nearly two years of dating and two years spent daydreaming of owning our own van, we had finally found the ONE. Thibaut and I joined the vanlife community in July 2016 when we adopted our first vanchild, a '93 Renault Trafic named Jean-Claude Van Dinic.
We quickly became addicted to the lifestyle and truly passionate about the community while on the road. However, we realized something quite quickly during our travels. It can get lonely on the road. We would arrive at a certain location and crave cracking open a beer with some new friends to chat about life on the road. But, there was no one around. Sure its great to swipe through photos on Instagram of other people doing the same thing as we were, but we wanted real human interaction. This is how the idea of Driftr App was born.
 
App Developers - Hypercube 

We have teamed up with top-notch app developers in Niš, Serbia who are helping us bring our idea to life. Established in 2013 as Hypercube LLC, they specialize in helping startups like Driftr from all over the world to create their minimum viable product (MVP), prepare it for market launch and aid in scaling. Hypercube has successfully delivered more than 50 projects, creating more than 100 iOS and Android apps with millions of users. Their success is attributed to having a well-rounded team of: 4 iOS developers, 4 Android developers, 1 QA engineer, 1 UI/UX designer, and 1 backend developer. Their diverse skills and experience allows them to take on any new idea and build it from scratch. They have been a tremendous support in helping the Driftr App team determine the possibilities and the best course of action to bring a high-quality, market-ready app to you. However, without fully funding this project, we will not be able to continue with developing the app.
 

Budget Breakdown 

The majority of funds will be spent on the development of the Driftr app, and on costs surrounding that development. There are also the mandatory fees to IndieGogo as well as ordering the awesome perks for you!
Our Goal is to raise $20,000, which gets us an iPhone app. If we raise even more than our goal, 30,000 raised gets us an Android app as well! 
Typically a project of this magnitude would be well into six-figure range. Due to strategic partnerships and the team’s experience level, we will be able to make the driftr app with much less.
Funds above $30,000 will be spent on Stage II development, which includes further optimizing the application based on community feedback, improving premium features, readying the app for monetization, and sharing the app with thousands of people around the world.  

 
Timeline
 
We have a very ambitious timeline that we have discussed in-depth with the Hypercube team who are determined to bring you the Driftr App just in time for your summer road trip! We will work non-stop to reach this target and ensure we get it to you as quickly as we can. 

Run Indiegogo Campaign: Mid-March -  Beginning of May 2017 (~45 days)
App Developed: May- End of June 2017 (2 months)
Beta Testing: End of June - beginning of July 2017
Launch App in the App Store: end of July 2017

Risks & Challenges
 
The app developers at Hypercube are very experienced, but there will always be risks in any app development effort:

This is a mobile, web, and server based software project, with all the risks normally associated with software development.
There are also various risks in approval and deployment from Apple that are out of our control. We do not anticipate any problems but it’s a process that we do not control.
Project costs and schedule estimates are the result of our evaluation of the technical and approval risks and Hypercube's deep familiarity with this type of project. There will, of course, be some unforeseen glitches, which will promptly be reported in the Updates section. We are committed to completing this project once the funding goal has been achieved, and keeping you informed every step of the way.",10.0,1,"1 Campaign

From the ""Heat Dome"" over the Pacific Northwest to temperature records shattered around the world, the Earth's climate is entering a new era marked by extreme heat. Is This the Best We Can Do?When we looked at current solutions to stay cool outside we found zero good options. What the heck, it’s 2021... is there really no good way to stay cool? In 100-degree weather it's going to take more than a sun hat, a bottle of water, and a wicking t-shirt to survive outside. Meet the Honu Cooling BackpackThe Honu Cooling Pack was designed for this hotter reality, standing at the fore of a new wave of climate-adaptive equipment as a new active cooling pack designed specifically for outdoor adventure.In contrast to passive cooling wearables—wicking fabrics, evaporative bandanas, and ice pack pockets—the Honu Cooling Pack is designed to actively remove heat from the wearer's body by circulating cool water through patented, thermally-conductive polymer tubing integrated throughout the pack. Honu leverages the body’s natural cooling biomechanics to reduce the experience of atmospheric temperatures by up to 20°F.[Insert ""Damn, that's nice!"" video]Honu's active cooling is achieved via a highly flexible and form-fitting network of ThermoCore™ thermoconductive microtubes, which circulate icy cold water from a custom designed reservoir. More than 60 feet of microtubing is built into the body of the pack’s lightweight taffeta nylon mesh, specifically targeting key heat extraction zones. The History Behind The TechnologyThe ThermoCore™ Active Cooling Technology was originally developed for the U.S. Army and Navy to lower core thermal temperatures in extreme environments. Designed to be maximally conductive and work in conjunction with the body’s physiological responses to temperature, the cooling technology performed extremely well in lab testing, achieving twice the heat extraction of other wearable cooling products. But the real proof came from the field, naval shipyard workers were blown away by the cooling capabilities of our cooling shirt.Made to support up to a half-day of high-exertion activity, the Honu's active cooling system was tested and refined by feedback from professional triathletes and avid hikers in Hawaii's hottest and most demanding environments. In controlled laboratory testing, the Honu achieved 2x the heat extraction of other wearable cooling products.The Honu uses ice cubes or gel packs to keep the pack’s water reservoir cold. Easy recharge in 30 seconds or less! Hugs Your Body Like a Turtle ShellHonu is the Hawaiian name for the endangered green sea turtle whose habitat is threatened by the effects of climate change and human activity. The Honu pack was designed by a team of engineers and designers in Hawaii as a personal cooling system that lowers body temperature, increases comfort, and extends the duration of hot-weather outdoor pursuits. Ready, Set, Go! - Ready to go in 30 secondsDesigned to get you up and outside as quickly as possible, the Honu can be prepped and ready to go in under 30 seconds. Simply fill the cooling bladder with ice or gel packs from the freezer, plug in the included power bank, and you’re ready to face the heat. The 3L cooling bladder provides up to 4 hours of maximum cooling duration.On the leading edge of a new wave in climate adapted equipment, the Honu Cooling Pack is a new breed of active cooling packs designed specifically for outdoor adventures - from mountain biking to hiking, and anything that keeps us active and outside. Designed to keep you outdoors - feeling cooler and adventuring longer. The Honu pack has been many years in the making. What first started as an idea for the US military turned into the pack you see today.

I immediately began thinking through how this tool might work and I eventually came up with a basic concept of the top and bottom piece. At that point, however, the tool's only real functionality was that it could very quickly tighten or loosen the hardware. Despite my excitement about this new idea, I recognized that other universal skate tools had a lot more functionality than my concept. This reality caused me to simply ""shelve"" the idea and move on with living my life.</p><p>Then, two months later, I experienced a light bulb moment.

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<div>As with any new business venture, there are certainly some risks and challenges. We've done our best to minimize these risks and challenges by doing as much leg work as possible prior to launching this campaign. So far, we've pitched this idea to several members of our local skateboarding community and these individuals have expressed an overwhelming amount of interest and excitement. Furthermore, as shown earlier, we've had a local engineering firm create a STAT prototype which proves the feasibility of our design. The engineers are now confident that they can bring STAT to life, if we are able to move forward!<p></p>
<p>As a backer, your risk is even smaller because we've chosen to launch a ""fixed funding"" campaign! This means that, <b>if we do not meet the $79,500 goal needed to actually produce STAT, you will receive a full refund at the end of the campaign.</b> In other words, your contribution will either help us bring STAT to market if the goal is reached or you will get your money back if the goal is not reached. There's really no downside to contributing!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3> <p><a href=""http://www.MassDomes.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>Mass Domes</strong></a> is an event and retreat center made of 9 geodesic domes that also serves as a center for storage &amp; shelter for local people in times of natural disasters like earthquakes, hurricanes, and storms. The name Mass Domes was carefully chosen as it has two meanings. The first means masses of people, the public in general. The second is Music, Arts, Spirituality, and Sustainability. The mission of Mass Domes is to empower people to live a happy, healthy and peaceful life by hosting events that would indulge them in music, arts, spirituality, yoga, and the celebration of life on a day to day basis.</p> <p>This magnificent humanitarian project is Initiated by a prudent team of highly accomplished, bold and creative MBA professionals from California State University. Mass Domes aims to create a better life for people by indulging them in Music, Arts, Spirituality &amp; Sustainability related events throughout the year while providing them organic food, natural views, beautiful hikes and overnight stays in glamping (read glamorous camping) dome tents.<br/> </p>

<p>Some key facts according to the <a href=""http://www.who.int/en/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/depression"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">World Health Organization</a>:</p>
<p>“Depression is a common mental disorder.”</p>
<p>“Globally, more than 300 million people of all ages suffer from depression.”</p>
<p>“Depression is the leading cause of disability worldwide, and is a major contributor to the overall global burden of disease.”</p>
<p>“At its worst, depression can lead to suicide.”</p> <p>Serving as a venue for a variety of concerts and other music events is the primary way that Mass Domes fulfills its mission. Music <a href=""https://www.massdomes.com/events.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">events</a> at Mass Domes will consist of electronic dance music, international live music performance, live jazz music, music lessons, open mike nights and popular music concerts with a full band. In addition to music, Mass Domes will execute its mission by hosting various other arts events. The arts events include dance classes, martial arts, live painting events, talent shows and theatre arts. In addition to this, others events will take place at Mass Domes with a spiritual focus. These include guest speaker events, meditation camps, spiritual teachings camps, team building events, share-your-journey events and yoga sessions.</p> <p>Through this campaign, the contributors will not only be creating an event and retreat center for themselves, but also for their future generations to come. Since these Geodesic domes are very strong in structure and strength, these domes can withstand earthquakes up to 8 Richter scale, hurricanes and storms up to 180 miles / hours. Due to their enormous strength and energy efficiency, these are self-sustainable, almost indestructible structures that would live on forever. The contributors of this campaign will become a part of the History for generations to come- a commonplace for music, arts, spirituality and sustainability that also serves as a storage and shelter for mankind in times of great natural disasters, created by the masses, for the masses.</p> <p>The structure’s design is inspired from the works of an architect <a href=""https://www.bfi.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Buckminster Fuller</a>, who created the concept of Geodesic Domes and promoted their superior strength. Compared to regular box-shaped homes, Mass Domes are 30% more energy efficient and cost effective to build. (Buckminster Fuller Institute, 2018) Mass Domes offer various small and big scale events for people of all ages.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>The events that will be held in the Mass Domes are:</strong></h3>
<p>Electronic Dance Music Events</p>

<p><strong>What We Need:</strong></p>
<p>Mass Domes will consist of one big dome and eight smaller geodesic domes and the estimated cost of constructing the event center are outlined below:</p>
<p>Main Dome: Approx Cost $100,000</p>
<p>8 Domess: $50,000/ dome = Approx $400,000</p>
<p>Land Improvement = Approx $100,000</p>
<p>Land= Approx $1,000,000 (Max)</p>
<p>Operational cost= $400,000</p>
<p>Total Cost = $2,000,000</p> <p>The funds raised from this campaign will be used to first purchase land in a strategic location where there are more chances of a natural disaster. Once the land is bought (Glad we have a Realtor in our Team!), we will then start building out the structures. Please note that our $1M budget for the land is considering a popular place like Ojai to serve as the first center, but that doesn’t mean that we will not be opening it anywhere else if in case our objectives to raise $2M in total is not reached. If we don’t reach our entire goal of the funds, we will find another location (Texas is our second choice) to buy the land and create Mass Domes there.</p> <p>Basically, we have decided to build Mass Domes wherever there is a human population in need of cultural camaraderie, human interaction, music, peace, love, happiness, sustainability, safety &amp; security and make their life feel fulfilled and meaningful.</p> <p><strong>What You Get:</strong></p>
<p>A place that could actually become your second home (or should we say dome?)</p>
<p>A place where you can visit alone or as a family and indulge in all the different experiences that we offer.</p>
<p>A place where you know you will be safe in times of great natural calamities, now and forever.</p>
<p>A place that will be visited by people of all generations and those of the next generations as well.</p>
<p>A place where you can learn more about natural living, self-healing and self-sustaining.</p> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>This campaign was built keeping in mind the need for humans today to live a more peaceful, safe and secure life that is constantly immersed in music, arts, spirituality, and at the same time promotes sustainability.</p>
<p>Each and every dollar that you contribute to this campaign will turn around to become a blessing for generations to come.</p>
<p>With a team of over 20 MBA professionals by our side and access to a lot of industry experts and consultants/mentors in specific fields such as Entertainment &amp; Sustainability, we are sure to make Mass Domes a great success and are eagerly waiting to begin our work.</p>
<p>The 3D renderings and motion graphics that you see in the video and the images are created by an Australian architect for us and she is as excited as we are in making this mission a successful one.</p>
<p>We are confident that this project will not be the only one of its kind after it is funded and it’s operations begin. We know that Mass Domes will create a new way of living life and very soon the world will start witnessing Mass Domes in every city, every state, and every country.</p> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>We are all Masters in Business Administration and no business model is created before a detailed SWOT analysis of the business and its environment is done. For the past couple of months, we have been diligently diving in deeper details of the entire business model and have come to a conclusion that this will not just turn around to be a profit-making business from the 3rd year onwards in its operations, but will also pave way for several more such event centers to be created in other cities like New Orleans, Texas, Puerto Rico, etc. </p> <p><strong>Strengths</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Versatile event space can be utilized by a variety of lucrative markets including Fortune 500 companies, weddings, and live music events which are all strong industries.</li>
<li>A strong brand which includes inspiring and encouraging people to live a happy, healthy and peaceful life.</li>
<li>Architecture is three times more efficient for many reasons. Its decreased surface area requires less building materials. Exposure to cold in the winter and heat in the summer is decreased because, being spherical, there is the least surface area per unit of volume per structure. (Buckminster Fuller Institute, 2018)</li>
<li>Provides emergency shelter especially for earthquakes. Its dome shape, the lack of a need for posts and beams in construction, and it's extremely lightweight the domes are highly earthquake resistant. (Real Estate Japan Inc., 2016)</li>
<li>Not lots of competitors</li>
<li>Creates employment opportunities</li>
<li>Promotes local talent- Acts as Platform for everybody to showcase their talent.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Weaknesses</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A requirement of a large amount land</li>
<li>A requirement for extensive permitting and licensing from local, state, and federal agencies</li>
<li>Budget: Large capital investment needed. The time frame to raise $2,000,000 is hard to predict.</li>
<li>Labor intensive and low availability of workers. The unemployment rate is currently in Ventura County was 3.6% in March 2018. (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2018)</li>
<li>Location of the event center poses a challenge since it is not close to the city (Los Angeles).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Opportunities</strong></p>
<ul>

</div></div>","Short Summary Mass Domes is an event and retreat center made of 9 geodesic domes that also serves as a center for storage & shelter for local people in times of natural disasters like earthquakes, hurricanes, and storms. The name Mass Domes was carefully chosen as it has two meanings. The first means masses of people, the public in general. The second is Music, Arts, Spirituality, and Sustainability. The mission of Mass Domes is to empower people to live a happy, healthy and peaceful life by hosting events that would indulge them in music, arts, spirituality, yoga, and the celebration of life on a day to day basis. This magnificent humanitarian project is Initiated by a prudent team of highly accomplished, bold and creative MBA professionals from California State University. Mass Domes aims to create a better life for people by indulging them in Music, Arts, Spirituality & Sustainability related events throughout the year while providing them organic food, natural views, beautiful hikes and overnight stays in glamping (read glamorous camping) dome tents. 
Quick A-Z about the team:
Ardavon Mohtashamnia: Electrical Engineer, Accounting certificate, Masters in Business Administration, Operations Supervisor.
Tom Nash: Bachelors in Business Administration, Executive Recruiter, Father of a 3 Months Old Boy, Electric Bassist - 'Hammersmyth', Masters in Business Administration, Sales & Operations Expert.  
Vania Marfo: Bachelors in Business Management, Finance Specialist, Human Rights Activist, Masters in Business Administration
Varun Ish Nanda: Author, Computer Engineer, FilmMaker, Masters in Media & Communications, Masters in Business Administration, Marketing Director, Product Development Expert, Realtor, Spiritual Director, Yogi. Do you know?
Some key facts according to the World Health Organization:
“Depression is a common mental disorder.”
“Globally, more than 300 million people of all ages suffer from depression.”
“Depression is the leading cause of disability worldwide, and is a major contributor to the overall global burden of disease.”
“At its worst, depression can lead to suicide.” Serving as a venue for a variety of concerts and other music events is the primary way that Mass Domes fulfills its mission. Music events at Mass Domes will consist of electronic dance music, international live music performance, live jazz music, music lessons, open mike nights and popular music concerts with a full band. In addition to music, Mass Domes will execute its mission by hosting various other arts events. The arts events include dance classes, martial arts, live painting events, talent shows and theatre arts. In addition to this, others events will take place at Mass Domes with a spiritual focus. These include guest speaker events, meditation camps, spiritual teachings camps, team building events, share-your-journey events and yoga sessions. Through this campaign, the contributors will not only be creating an event and retreat center for themselves, but also for their future generations to come. Since these Geodesic domes are very strong in structure and strength, these domes can withstand earthquakes up to 8 Richter scale, hurricanes and storms up to 180 miles / hours. Due to their enormous strength and energy efficiency, these are self-sustainable, almost indestructible structures that would live on forever. The contributors of this campaign will become a part of the History for generations to come- a commonplace for music, arts, spirituality and sustainability that also serves as a storage and shelter for mankind in times of great natural disasters, created by the masses, for the masses. The structure’s design is inspired from the works of an architect Buckminster Fuller, who created the concept of Geodesic Domes and promoted their superior strength. Compared to regular box-shaped homes, Mass Domes are 30% more energy efficient and cost effective to build. (Buckminster Fuller Institute, 2018) Mass Domes offer various small and big scale events for people of all ages.
 
The events that will be held in the Mass Domes are:
Electronic Dance Music Events
International Live Music Performances
Live Jazz Events
Music Teaching Sessions/ Lessons
Open Mike Night
Popular Music Concerts with a Full Band
Dance Classes
Live Painting Events
Martial Arts
Painting Classes

Marriage / Private Events
Trade Shows / Events
Virtual Reality Events What We Need & What You Get
What We Need:
Mass Domes will consist of one big dome and eight smaller geodesic domes and the estimated cost of constructing the event center are outlined below:
Main Dome: Approx Cost $100,000
8 Domess: $50,000/ dome = Approx $400,000
Land Improvement = Approx $100,000
Land= Approx $1,000,000 (Max)
Operational cost= $400,000
Total Cost = $2,000,000 The funds raised from this campaign will be used to first purchase land in a strategic location where there are more chances of a natural disaster. Once the land is bought (Glad we have a Realtor in our Team!), we will then start building out the structures. Please note that our $1M budget for the land is considering a popular place like Ojai to serve as the first center, but that doesn’t mean that we will not be opening it anywhere else if in case our objectives to raise $2M in total is not reached. If we don’t reach our entire goal of the funds, we will find another location (Texas is our second choice) to buy the land and create Mass Domes there. Basically, we have decided to build Mass Domes wherever there is a human population in need of cultural camaraderie, human interaction, music, peace, love, happiness, sustainability, safety & security and make their life feel fulfilled and meaningful. What You Get:
A place that could actually become your second home (or should we say dome?)
A place where you can visit alone or as a family and indulge in all the different experiences that we offer.
A place where you know you will be safe in times of great natural calamities, now and forever.
A place that will be visited by people of all generations and those of the next generations as well.
A place where you can learn more about natural living, self-healing and self-sustaining. The Impact
 
This campaign was built keeping in mind the need for humans today to live a more peaceful, safe and secure life that is constantly immersed in music, arts, spirituality, and at the same time promotes sustainability.
Each and every dollar that you contribute to this campaign will turn around to become a blessing for generations to come.
With a team of over 20 MBA professionals by our side and access to a lot of industry experts and consultants/mentors in specific fields such as Entertainment & Sustainability, we are sure to make Mass Domes a great success and are eagerly waiting to begin our work.
The 3D renderings and motion graphics that you see in the video and the images are created by an Australian architect for us and she is as excited as we are in making this mission a successful one.
We are confident that this project will not be the only one of its kind after it is funded and it’s operations begin. We know that Mass Domes will create a new way of living life and very soon the world will start witnessing Mass Domes in every city, every state, and every country. Risks & Challenges We are all Masters in Business Administration and no business model is created before a detailed SWOT analysis of the business and its environment is done. For the past couple of months, we have been diligently diving in deeper details of the entire business model and have come to a conclusion that this will not just turn around to be a profit-making business from the 3rd year onwards in its operations, but will also pave way for several more such event centers to be created in other cities like New Orleans, Texas, Puerto Rico, etc.  Strengths

Versatile event space can be utilized by a variety of lucrative markets including Fortune 500 companies, weddings, and live music events which are all strong industries.
A strong brand which includes inspiring and encouraging people to live a happy, healthy and peaceful life.
Architecture is three times more efficient for many reasons. Its decreased surface area requires less building materials. Exposure to cold in the winter and heat in the summer is decreased because, being spherical, there is the least surface area per unit of volume per structure. (Buckminster Fuller Institute, 2018)
Provides emergency shelter especially for earthquakes. Its dome shape, the lack of a need for posts and beams in construction, and it's extremely lightweight the domes are highly earthquake resistant. (Real Estate Japan Inc., 2016)
Not lots of competitors
Creates employment opportunities
Promotes local talent- Acts as Platform for everybody to showcase their talent.

Weaknesses

A requirement of a large amount land
A requirement for extensive permitting and licensing from local, state, and federal agencies
Budget: Large capital investment needed. The time frame to raise $2,000,000 is hard to predict.
Labor intensive and low availability of workers. The unemployment rate is currently in Ventura County was 3.6% in March 2018. (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2018)
Location of the event center poses a challenge since it is not close to the city (Los Angeles).

Opportunities

It may grow quick locally and internationally
Brand support from Fortune 500 companies. By offering our space to large corporations, the Mass Domes brand will be very well known which will help drive business to other events such as weddings and concerts.
Incorporating clean energy technology. For example, Dome-Tech could collaborate and be partnered with Mass Domes to build on-site renewable and clean power systems and delivers hands-on energy conservation services for Mass Domes. (Connell Foley, 2012)

Threats

The land hasn’t been purchased yet and there is low inventory. This could create a bottleneck.
Solution: Buy a lesser expensive land in a different location.

Security because of the isolated location. Live music events can be targets for violence. 58 people were murdered in a Las Vegas concert on October 1st, 2018. (Brean, 2018) A live event can be risky and dangerous in terms of security concerns.
Solution: Create security checkpoints at all entries and exits with metal detectors.

<p style=""margin-left:200px;"">    IT’S UP AND RUNNING!</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">The lowest online prices for hotel, villa, and apartment accommodation.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">The highest payments &amp; benefits for hotel owners. </p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">FAR2LOW.COM is revolutionising the hotel booking industry, by selling hotel rooms for the lowest online price anywhere. </p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">We’ve created the FAR2LOW formula to be very different to other online hotel booking websites, by selling FAR2LOW nights with a long use by date and changing the commission structure. This means customers purchase FAR2LOW nights online from FAR2LOW, and then book their FAR2LOW nights directly with the hotel within the use by date we’ve negotiated.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Confirmation is immediate and you’re ready to go!</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">OUR New Commission formula is just this. No Greed, Just Growth! </p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">We want to be known worldwide for offering the cheapest hotel accommodation and for our customers to be able to buy FAR2LOW nights at hotels anywhere in the world. </p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">At the same time, our intention is to improve the online hotel sales experience and to help hotels with our no commission, no fees, and free advertising model. </p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Let’s explain how hotels get a better deal and make more money with FAR2LOW. </p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Most hotel booking sites, expect a big percentage of the room rate in order to make money from sending business their way. We’ve made our service totally free. </p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">FAR2LOW will be offering our hotels free advertising, no commission, and no fees to get them to sign up with us. Yes, we did say no commission.               </p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">We will ask the hotel that with the savings they make by using our service, for example, the commission and fees they lose to pay the hotel booking sites, we ask them to take this off their room price and let us advertise the room for the amount they receive after their commission and fees are paid.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">This means the hotel gets the same amount and we make 12% on every night sold online by charging the customer, not the hotel. Doing this means we can sell nights at the lowest price anywhere online and create the same profit for the hotels, and save customers up to 50% and more on prices currently available online. </p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">FAR2LOW has even more unique benefits to offer the hotels compared to other booking sites. We give the hotels 100% upfront payment for every night sold so the hotels don’t have to wait until the customers stay at their accommodation for the money.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Some of the biggest complaints we hear from hotel owners are about cancellations and having to wait until the customer stays at their accommodation to receive payment. FAR2LOW solves this problem by having a no cancellation policy and upfront payment to the hotel from the moment the customer purchases online.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">To protect the hotels from current contracts and price wars, we have included in our contract a clause to protect them from any contract they currently have. This unique clause guarantees the hotels will not be penalised by other booking sites for them advertising a lower price with us. </p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Our purpose and mission is to help people and improve the future. So, we’re sharing our big idea.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">JOIN US FOR OUR NEW CAMPAIGN! </p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Over the last few months, we have shared our vision for FAR2LOW.COM. And we are overwhelmed with the response. Our team of professionals have come together to get this up and running, we’re proving to everyone that this is a winning formula and is making a positive change in the hotel accommodation and travel industry.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">New enquiries and positive feedback are flowing in everyday and these have generated new opportunities for us to see how much further FAR2LOW can reach. This is our first Indigogo campaign and first new goal. Scroll down to see all the details!</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">New things are happening with online Hotel Booking!</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">We’re up and running and we’ve identified how much we need to raise to take our idea to the next stage. Sure, we still hope we raise as much as we can, but by creating a smaller goal we can upscale faster and maintain the flexibility we need to grow at the right pace. So, we’re launching this crowd funding with a smaller incremental starting goal of $25,000. </p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Reaching our goal of $25,000 allows us to complete our marketing strategy for promoting our site throughout the whole of Indonesia. This will complete our first phase.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">And we are looking to grow fast; just capturing 1% of the available market shows great returns. We are currently in Bali, and soon to be expanding throughout the whole of Indonesia – hotel market 3.5 million rooms per night. Our first year goal is to be adding at least 10 hotels per month, so 120 new hotel signings a year.  By 2022 we will be expanding into other Asian markets, and in 2023 we’ll be taking our brand worldwide… imagine the potential.  We ask hotels to guarantee us a minimum 100 FAR2LOW nights per year, but most long term deals will be for 1000 nights or more, you do the maths on those figures but we think they are pretty impressive.</p>

<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">We are also creating this concept so that nights sold on FAR2LOW will benefit families and children in need.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">We’re automatically donating 2% to charity for each booking made. We are currently working with BALI 2020 AID, and we’ll be signing up other charities as we expand.

<p>But don't take our word for it, check out what everyone else is saying. With 15 million video views and counting, crowd intelligence suggests the concept could be disruptive.</p>

<h3><strong>Advantages of the Mollusc Design</strong></h3>
<p><strong>1. Effortless temperature control.</strong></p>
<p>Ordinary tents are a nightmare in the sun. They are mini greenhouses which you can't stay in when its warm - a shame really, as 95% of all camping is done in the summer! If your Nano gets too hot, just unzip, pull back the canopy and breathe in the fresh air by the lungful. You can have your breakfast in there, sunbathe or just hang out.  If it starts raining or the clouds come in, simply draw the canopy back over, zip up and snuggle down - simple but effective.</p>
<div style=""text-align: center;""><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/4qt5SB4PvGU?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<div> </div>
<p><strong>2. Incredible versatility.</strong></p>
<p>You can have the tent fully open or closed but also fix it pretty much anywhere in between. This means you can morph the tent shape to the particular environmental conditions or the purpose you want. These are the six main configurations or <a href=""https://www.mollusctents.com/nano-2-slideshow"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">go here to see them full screen</a></p>

<p>The best laid plans can and do go wrong.

This is a totally new design of tent - we cant tell you yet how it will perform in sub-zero conditions, up at 18,000ft or under 3ft of snow. We can't promise that there wont be a single problem with delivery, manufacturing schedule or quality control. All we can say is that we will deal with any problems honestly and promptly as they arise and will be 100% transparent with our backers - We have a growing community of 2500 followers on social media which we can't afford to alienate.

</div></div>","Most tents are designed to be used in one way. Mollusc is different. It is a completely new, versatile design of tent that can be used in at least 6 different ways.
All we've done is take the simple open and close functionality from a babies pramhood and put it into a tent. When you think about it that way, its amazing that no one has done it before because it gives the camper an array of benefits that ordinary, static tents simply don't have.
But don't take our word for it, check out what everyone else is saying. With 15 million video views and counting, crowd intelligence suggests the concept could be disruptive.
  ""Good tent or best tent?""  
     ""revolutionary new design""
    ""one of a kind shelter, great for car camping""
""panoramic views while  camping""
    ""The most revolutionary tent ever"" 

       ""your new camping essential""    
     ""the perfect tent to get you through the festival season""

     "" I love this thing!""   
     ""will change the way you go camping""
      ""exceptionally cool""     
   ""could shake up camping industry""                                               
 
Advantages of the Mollusc Design
1. Effortless temperature control.
Ordinary tents are a nightmare in the sun. They are mini greenhouses which you can't stay in when its warm - a shame really, as 95% of all camping is done in the summer! If your Nano gets too hot, just unzip, pull back the canopy and breathe in the fresh air by the lungful. You can have your breakfast in there, sunbathe or just hang out.  If it starts raining or the clouds come in, simply draw the canopy back over, zip up and snuggle down - simple but effective.

 
2. Incredible versatility.
You can have the tent fully open or closed but also fix it pretty much anywhere in between. This means you can morph the tent shape to the particular environmental conditions or the purpose you want. These are the six main configurations or go here to see them full screen
Fully open for sunbathing, star-gazing or just hanging out

(Double click all images to enlarge)
Picnic setting, a perfect windbreak for the lake or beach

Parasol for when you need a little shade from the sun

Clamshell - enjoy the outside world from inside your space

Closed - use like an ordinary tent. Just roomier and racier

Storm setting - pinned down hard for high wind

 
3. Spacious, rugged, storm proof
With over 9 square metres of floor space, there is plenty of room for 3 big adults and even 4 if you're good friends. It weighs in at 10.3Kgs so its not a backpackers tent (unless a group of you are sharing the load) but with that weight comes a lot of strength and durability. In bad weather the canopy is fully drawn over and the perimeter arc frame is pegged down directly giving limpet-like adhesion. If that isn't enough, 7 storm guys can be fixed to the frame at different points depending on the wind direction. Its unique tubular exoskeleton means that in hard ground it can be pitched totally without any pegging at all! (There is an optional perk of 8 sand bags for people who want to put it up at the beach where pegs wouldn't hold).
No-peg pitching - use rocks or sandbags

 
4. Enjoy the outside world from your inside space
With standard tents you are either inside or outside. With the Nano that no longer applies. in its 'Clamshell' setting you can enjoy that panoramic view whilst keeping out the weather.

5. Easy setup
 1 person - 15 minutes, With a bit of practise, 2 can do it in 10. We'll email all backers the download link for our mobile-friendly guided, step-by-step set up PowerPoint - you can put it in on your phone and use it in the field.
       Watch me do it in 48 secs

 
6. Integrated solar light string (optional)
50 cool white LEDs hung from underside of peak arc and external micro panel with mount. Its obviously not a floodlight but on a days charge it will give good ambient light all night and enable you to find that torch. IP68 rated (can submerge) and unaffected by opening/closing. (Light unit ships separately).

                                          
 
 
 
 
 
7. Lockable rear door with fly screen
Optional lightweight combination lock (no key to lose) secures the tent from an opportunist thief when you're not around. Door is double zipped so can be locked from the inside as well. Fly screen independently zipped.

8. Packs up small

 
 
 
 
 
   
9. Everything you need 

                             (Click through image to see all components labelled)
10. Eleven trees planted in Kenya to compensate for the resource and delivery footprint
GPS co-ordinates of trees emailed after planting so in time they will be viewable on Google Earth. It doesn't make the tent sustainable - just better than doing nothing

<p>Navigatio is born to approach those companies that offer different and quality tourist activities that go unnoticed for the general public. From Navigatio we believe that the future of tourism is directed towards less crowded activities that allow travelers to enjoy destinations in a more personalized way.<br/>The digital revolution has shaken the tourism sector, however, the customer still has to travel the Net to find a specific activity at the risk of not finding what they are looking for.<br/>Navigatio gives companies the possibility to advertise on the web and gain greater visibility at cost 0. Our positioning system classifies the tourist options according to the opinion of the users registered in the portal. Advertisers publish their own offers on the web according to defined requirements that ensure visibility. The main objective is to promote the dissemination of advertisers on the Internet.<br/>Navigatio does not appear as an object of competition for companies in the tourism sector, but as a resource that allows the expansion and growth of advertisers.<br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1496514011/hwfe27x56gq35p7zzreu.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The Navigatio website allows you to find your ideal activity due to its organized and intuitive structure. Our purpose is that the users have easy access to the tourist content of Catalonia.</p>
<p>In our website you will find the activities organized by categories and destinations. You will also be able to search among the best valued activities by our users or those that are fashionable among the Navigatio community.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1496751290/qvnhclfthk01arhinx6d.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>The positioning of advertisers on the Navigatio website is based on users' opinions about the activities. Those companies or brands with better ratings will be the first to appear on the web. Thus, Navigatio's community is responsible for regulating what is promoted on the web. Our goal with this positioning policy is to promote those companies that offer quality that go unnoticed in the immensity of the Net.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1496513692/ixrfzwcxjvahuewsords.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The arrival of the Internet has changed our way of traveling, as well as our concept of tourism. New technologies have allowed us to personalize our holidays. One of Navigatio's mottos is: your trip, your rules. For this, the Navigatio project integrates several options that will allow the user to make their trip perfectly tailor-made.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1496593903/cf3lfxilpq6jjohgt5fm.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>- <strong>Easy Choice</strong>. This tool helps you create unique activity packs for you. The option allows, through a form indicating your preferences and your destination, the creation of a pack of activities unique to you.</p>
<p>- <strong>I'm in!</strong> This tool is another of the innovations that you will find in Navigatio for those who do not want to miss anything. I'm in! Allows users to create lists or groups in different activities. In this way, Navigatio allows direct contact between users and companies.</p>
<p>- <strong>Geotag</strong>. This tool allows you to search for activities by geolocation. Select from the best activities available near you from anywhere.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1496513758/itpcl62tpg9ri1lm20wr.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>Our current funding is purely crowdfunding and we have started this campaign to launch our project. For the development of Navigatio we need to have a logistic support to help us in the final design of the website. The main part of what we collect will go to touch up and improve the website. What we want with the IndieGoGo campaign is to create a structure of Navigatio on the Net that allow us to shape all of our proposals to the web portal.</p>
<p>Another of the investment aspects will be the initiation of a campaign of marketing in social networks and Internet. We are aware of the importance of a good publicity and marketing campaign for the promotion of the brand, so we want to destine a portion of what we collect to Navigatio advertising on Facebook, Instragram and other social networks.</p>
<p>Finally, another part of the crowdfunding will go to the active maintenance of the web page, managements derived from the project correct working or as a reserve fund for possible contingencies that may arise during the growth of Navigatio.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1496513882/wekiljjh0rpzrhjhrhlw.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Any little contribution to our campaign will help us greatly in the development of Navigatio. The objective of posting the project in IndieGoGo is to receive financial aid through this crowdfunding campaign, however, any other contribution either in disseminating the Navigatio project or in advertising the IndieGoGo brand or campaign through social networks. From the page of Navigatio we will start different promotional actions and campaigns to make us known in Catalonia first, and expand through the Spanish territory later. Thus, our goal in IndieGoGo is to boost the project financially through the donations we receive in crowdfunding, however, any contribution to Navigatio will be well received. With this we want to point out that the monetary contributions are as important as the actions of diffusion of the project in both IndieGoGo and social networks.</p>

<p><strong>- Is it free to register at Navigatio?</strong></p>
<p>The Navigatio Services for the users is 100% free, you can book as many activities as you want without any cost.</p>
<p><strong>- What future ideas does Navigatio have?</strong></p>
<p>At the moment we start with Catalonia, but we have the objective to finish working in all the Spanish territory, and in the future we will expand as much as possible. Also in the future we want to expand to all platforms.</p>
<p><strong>- How will Navigatio earn money in the future?</strong></p>
<p>Navigatio will be left with a small part of the profits obtained with the sale of each activity published on the web, that is why, if our method does not favor the growth of your activities you will not spend nor a euro.</p>
<p><strong>- What activity can I choose if I win the draw?</strong></p>
<p>The list of activities is the same for the draw either for the reward of 1 or 2 activities. The list will be made public in the updates section.</p>
<p><strong>- Can I choose an activity other than in Catalonia?</strong></p>
<p>The Navigatio Work area is Catalonia, and that is why we can not offer activities outside Catalonia.</p>
<p><strong>- With the perk Taste the city what activity will I have?</strong></p>
<p>With this reward you will get an activity to visit the best tapas bars in Barcelona, ​​so you can learn about their customs and traditions from another point of view.</p>

Navigatio is for those who want to discover without getting lost among thousands of Internet pages, for those who doesn’t want to lose a second discovering new experiences.
 
Navigatio is born to approach those companies that offer different and quality tourist activities that go unnoticed for the general public. From Navigatio we believe that the future of tourism is directed towards less crowded activities that allow travelers to enjoy destinations in a more personalized way.The digital revolution has shaken the tourism sector, however, the customer still has to travel the Net to find a specific activity at the risk of not finding what they are looking for.Navigatio gives companies the possibility to advertise on the web and gain greater visibility at cost 0. Our positioning system classifies the tourist options according to the opinion of the users registered in the portal. Advertisers publish their own offers on the web according to defined requirements that ensure visibility. The main objective is to promote the dissemination of advertisers on the Internet.Navigatio does not appear as an object of competition for companies in the tourism sector, but as a resource that allows the expansion and growth of advertisers.
The Navigatio website allows you to find your ideal activity due to its organized and intuitive structure. Our purpose is that the users have easy access to the tourist content of Catalonia.
In our website you will find the activities organized by categories and destinations. You will also be able to search among the best valued activities by our users or those that are fashionable among the Navigatio community.


The positioning of advertisers on the Navigatio website is based on users' opinions about the activities. Those companies or brands with better ratings will be the first to appear on the web. Thus, Navigatio's community is responsible for regulating what is promoted on the web. Our goal with this positioning policy is to promote those companies that offer quality that go unnoticed in the immensity of the Net.

The arrival of the Internet has changed our way of traveling, as well as our concept of tourism. New technologies have allowed us to personalize our holidays. One of Navigatio's mottos is: your trip, your rules. For this, the Navigatio project integrates several options that will allow the user to make their trip perfectly tailor-made.

- Easy Choice. This tool helps you create unique activity packs for you. The option allows, through a form indicating your preferences and your destination, the creation of a pack of activities unique to you.
- I'm in! This tool is another of the innovations that you will find in Navigatio for those who do not want to miss anything. I'm in! Allows users to create lists or groups in different activities. In this way, Navigatio allows direct contact between users and companies.
- Geotag. This tool allows you to search for activities by geolocation. Select from the best activities available near you from anywhere.


Our current funding is purely crowdfunding and we have started this campaign to launch our project. For the development of Navigatio we need to have a logistic support to help us in the final design of the website. The main part of what we collect will go to touch up and improve the website. What we want with the IndieGoGo campaign is to create a structure of Navigatio on the Net that allow us to shape all of our proposals to the web portal.
Another of the investment aspects will be the initiation of a campaign of marketing in social networks and Internet. We are aware of the importance of a good publicity and marketing campaign for the promotion of the brand, so we want to destine a portion of what we collect to Navigatio advertising on Facebook, Instragram and other social networks.
Finally, another part of the crowdfunding will go to the active maintenance of the web page, managements derived from the project correct working or as a reserve fund for possible contingencies that may arise during the growth of Navigatio.

Any little contribution to our campaign will help us greatly in the development of Navigatio. The objective of posting the project in IndieGoGo is to receive financial aid through this crowdfunding campaign, however, any other contribution either in disseminating the Navigatio project or in advertising the IndieGoGo brand or campaign through social networks. From the page of Navigatio we will start different promotional actions and campaigns to make us known in Catalonia first, and expand through the Spanish territory later. Thus, our goal in IndieGoGo is to boost the project financially through the donations we receive in crowdfunding, however, any contribution to Navigatio will be well received. With this we want to point out that the monetary contributions are as important as the actions of diffusion of the project in both IndieGoGo and social networks.

- Is it free to register at Navigatio?
The Navigatio Services for the users is 100% free, you can book as many activities as you want without any cost.
- What future ideas does Navigatio have?
At the moment we start with Catalonia, but we have the objective to finish working in all the Spanish territory, and in the future we will expand as much as possible. Also in the future we want to expand to all platforms.
- How will Navigatio earn money in the future?
Navigatio will be left with a small part of the profits obtained with the sale of each activity published on the web, that is why, if our method does not favor the growth of your activities you will not spend nor a euro.
- What activity can I choose if I win the draw?
The list of activities is the same for the draw either for the reward of 1 or 2 activities. The list will be made public in the updates section.
- Can I choose an activity other than in Catalonia?
The Navigatio Work area is Catalonia, and that is why we can not offer activities outside Catalonia.
- With the perk Taste the city what activity will I have?
With this reward you will get an activity to visit the best tapas bars in Barcelona, ​​so you can learn about their customs and traditions from another point of view.
- With the Lovely Navigatio reward, what activity will I have? With this reward you can also choose an activity from a list that will be published later in the updates section.",14.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Flory and Scott want you want to experience the only beach in the Western Hemisphere where people live longer and happier, with less stress and a lot more joy. A sense of calm and peace that is unmistakable... and unforgettable.</p>
<p>Flory, fluent in Spanish and English, was born just a few miles from where her little hotel will be built. Scott just happens to have years in the hotel business learning under a very successful hotelier.</p>
<p>They love people and together they form a hospitable team ready to welcome friends, new and old, to the most unforgettable beach in Costa Rica.</p>

<h3>Flory's Dream</h3>
<p>Flory Loria Segura was born in Costa Rica with a dream to share the magnificent natural beauty of her country by building a beautiful little boutique hotel on the beach. A place where people could come to relax, unwind and enjoy romantic nights following a breathtaking sunset. </p>
<p>Twenty years ago Flory bought land so close to the beach that you can hear the ocean, and for twenty years the only occupants have been the monkeys in the trees. It's time to make Flory's dream come true.</p>
<p>Have you ever dreamed of taking an unforgettable vacation without having to get a second mortgage? Let's help each other. Become one of our backers. To make your dream come true we need to build Flory's little hotel.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We already own the land and we've drawn up all the plans. We know how long the project will take to construct and we have the contractors already lined up to build Flory's little hotel. In addition to the money we've already spent, and the money we have in the bank, we need an additional $50,000 to build four rooms. </p>
<p>Even though most of our perks are designed to give you years of amazing vacations we designed them so you get more than your money's worth if you only stay with us one time.</p>
<p>For example, our $297 perk includes 10 nights over two years, including two bonus nights. All rooms are double occupancy with king sized beds and air conditioning. By the way, king size beds and air conditioning is rare in Santa Teresa and Playa Hermosa.</p>
<p>A comparable room in our area would cost about $150. Let's say you stay for 6 nights. You'd normally pay $900, but since you are one of our backers you saved more than $600. And you have another 4 nights for next year.</p>

<h3>Give Your Nights Away or Sell Them</h3>
<p>Know anybody who'd love to take an extraordinary vacation? You may gift your nights to anyone or you can sell them one time. (Special thanks to Gabrielle for coming up with this idea.) </p>
<p>Let's say you choose the $497 perk which includes 5 nights a year for 3 years plus 5 bonus nights. You come and spend 7 nights your first year. (5 nights plus 2 of your bonus nights.)</p>
<p>You have a friend who gets married or somebody you know is celebrating an anniversary and you want to do something special for them. You could give them your 5 nights and your 3 remaining bonus nights. That's 7 nights for you, 8 nights in Costa Rica for your friends and you still have 5 nights left for you the next year!</p>
<p>You get all of that for only $497 one time.</p>
<p>With our $997 perk you could spend 7 nights a year in our little boutique hotel for 6 years and you could give somebody 14 nights. (Gift your 7 nights and your 7 bonus nights.)</p>

<h3>No Blackout Dates and No Restrictions</h3>
<p>You want a vacation you will cherish forever, we want to build our hotel.</p>
<p>With that in mind we're doing something a little different from all the other hotels in the area. When demand is high some hotel owners raise their rates considerably. They just consider that good business.</p>
<p>But it wouldn't be right to take your money and not give you, the most desirable dates. So here's our promise to you, our backers: you can choose any nights you want to stay with us, and if a room is available it's yours! </p>

<p>We want to build Flory's little hotel.</p>
<p>Some people have asked us this question, ""How do I know you'll even be in business 3 years from now?"" Great question. When we successfully raise $50,000 we will build our little hotel with no debt. All businesses that fail do so because they run out of money. Our little boutique hotel will generate cash every week, and with no debt it'll be easy to pay the bills.</p>
<p>This is where we are going to live for the rest of our lives. It's a fundamental lifestyle decision, and passion.</p>
<p>Please remember that when you back our project you will receive a 100% refund if we fail to reach our goal. When we succeed, however, you can stay with your friends in paradise for the number of nights that you choose!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1585848575/js7lln9trek3du312nhx.png"" src=""""/></p>
<ul style=""list-style-type:circle;""><li>The main <strong>goal</strong> is to continue 8000 years of ancient Qvevri winemaking tradition which contributes romantic ideal that celebrates the Georgia’s history and to preserve the tradition for future generations.</li></ul>
<p>Qvevri winemaking tradition - Georgia is generally considered the ‘cradle of wine’, as archaeologists have traced the world’s first known wine creation back to the people of the South Caucasus in 6,000 BC. On the territory of the country during various excavations ancient jugs called “Qvevri” with the remnants of grape seeds and skins were found, indicating that the people who lived in these lands, had knowledge of the cultivation of the grape and making wine long  before our era. The wine-making process involves pressing the grapes and then pouring the juice, grape skins, stalks and pips into the Qvevri, which is sealed and buried in the ground so that the wine can ferment for five to six months before being drunk. In 2013 Georgia’s traditional winemaking method of fermenting grapes in earthenware, egg-shaped vessels has been added to the world heritage list of the United Nations educational, scientific and cultural organization (UNESCO). This means, that qvevri winemaking method is part of the Intangible Heritage of Humanity.</p>
<p>Winemakers use kvevris of various sizes, from 20 to 5000 liters, while currently the most popular are those with a capacity of 1-2 thousand litres.  Kvevris are produced   from sticky clay using only hands without a potter's wheel and fired to dry out in a special ceramic furnace.  This is a very labour-intensive and hard job, requiring precision, skills and patience, and today only a few potters throughout Georgia continue such production. Good quality kvevri can be used to make the wine for a hundred years and more, without losing its flavor.<br/> </p>

<p>We are startup enterpreneurs with great enthusiasm and knowledge to support the tradition in most famous winemaking part of Georgia in Kakheti region (Kvareli municipality) where we built a vintage style<u> </u>wine cellar, with underground floor for wine storage and ground floor with kitchen.  We already start to buy some old things that we can use after the building will be done.  The wine also  will be made in Georgian traditional way.</p>
<p>The total investment we have already undertaken is approximately 80,000 Euros (30,000 land, 40,000 buildings and 10,000 grape plants) and at this point 50% of the work is done. We will harvest the first grapes in the fall of 2020. The underground cellar floor is also complete which was about 60% of the total cost of the building.</p>
<p>Since we have already purchased several qvevri wines we will be able to produce our first 4500 liters of qvevri wine this year. But we will need one more year to finalize all the necessary items (Cellar, house interior, outdoor interior, garden, etc.).</p>
<p>We are planning to start receiving guests in our cellar next year. Guests will be able to experience a real wine making tradition and enjoy Georgian hospitality.</p>
<p>In order to make all this happen we need contributors who will help raise 25,000 Euros. This amount will give us an opportunity to finalize the remaining work, produce high quality wine and start receiving guests.</p>

The main goal is to continue 8000 years of ancient Qvevri winemaking tradition which contributes romantic ideal that celebrates the Georgia’s history and to preserve the tradition for future generations.
Qvevri winemaking tradition - Georgia is generally considered the ‘cradle of wine’, as archaeologists have traced the world’s first known wine creation back to the people of the South Caucasus in 6,000 BC. On the territory of the country during various excavations ancient jugs called “Qvevri” with the remnants of grape seeds and skins were found, indicating that the people who lived in these lands, had knowledge of the cultivation of the grape and making wine long  before our era. The wine-making process involves pressing the grapes and then pouring the juice, grape skins, stalks and pips into the Qvevri, which is sealed and buried in the ground so that the wine can ferment for five to six months before being drunk. In 2013 Georgia’s traditional winemaking method of fermenting grapes in earthenware, egg-shaped vessels has been added to the world heritage list of the United Nations educational, scientific and cultural organization (UNESCO). This means, that qvevri winemaking method is part of the Intangible Heritage of Humanity.
Winemakers use kvevris of various sizes, from 20 to 5000 liters, while currently the most popular are those with a capacity of 1-2 thousand litres.  Kvevris are produced   from sticky clay using only hands without a potter's wheel and fired to dry out in a special ceramic furnace.  This is a very labour-intensive and hard job, requiring precision, skills and patience, and today only a few potters throughout Georgia continue such production. Good quality kvevri can be used to make the wine for a hundred years and more, without losing its flavor. 
 
 
The wine-making process involves pressing the grapes and then pouring the juice, grape skins, stalks and pips into the Qvevri, which is sealed and buried in the ground so that the wine can ferment for five to six months before being drunk.
                       
 
After six month the wine can be replaced to other Qvevri and save for many years
      
 
We are startup enterpreneurs with great enthusiasm and knowledge to support the tradition in most famous winemaking part of Georgia in Kakheti region (Kvareli municipality) where we built a vintage style wine cellar, with underground floor for wine storage and ground floor with kitchen.  We already start to buy some old things that we can use after the building will be done.  The wine also  will be made in Georgian traditional way.
The total investment we have already undertaken is approximately 80,000 Euros (30,000 land, 40,000 buildings and 10,000 grape plants) and at this point 50% of the work is done. We will harvest the first grapes in the fall of 2020. The underground cellar floor is also complete which was about 60% of the total cost of the building.
Since we have already purchased several qvevri wines we will be able to produce our first 4500 liters of qvevri wine this year. But we will need one more year to finalize all the necessary items (Cellar, house interior, outdoor interior, garden, etc.).
We are planning to start receiving guests in our cellar next year. Guests will be able to experience a real wine making tradition and enjoy Georgian hospitality.
In order to make all this happen we need contributors who will help raise 25,000 Euros. This amount will give us an opportunity to finalize the remaining work, produce high quality wine and start receiving guests.

<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Aviation is one of the most harmful means of transportation for the environment. We all travel by plane from time to time, and huge amounts of CO2 are emitted. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>THE SOLUTION </b></p>
<p>Our free app provides an opportunity to neutralize – or offset – those emissions. Every time you travel by plane a considerable amount of CO2 is emitted into the atmosphere. Using our app you can both offset these emissions and invest  into green energy projects – solar, wind or small hydro – around the world. </p>

<p>Your modest contribution into these projects will prevent CO2 emissions in the future that are equal to CO2 emissions from your flight.BINGO – your carbon footprint from the flight is completely neutralized.  </p>
<p><b>THE </b><b>EFFECT</b></p>
<p>By using our app you are not only offsetting your CO2 emissions, you help to create green jobs in developing countries, improve power supply and level of life locally.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>
<p>If just 5% of air travelers will use our app, we’ll be able to achieve amazing results:</p>
<p>-<span>  </span>That would offset <b>45 million</b> <b>tons</b> of CO2 a year. Is it much or little?</p>
<p>-<span>  </span>1,8 billion trees absorb this much CO2 a year!</p>
<p>-<span>  </span>200 million people would breathe entire year to exhale this much CO2!</p>
<p>-<span>  </span>12 million cars off the road – that’s the effect (total number of cars in the state of New-York, or half of all vehicles in a huge country like Canada!)</p>That much CO2 is emitted by such economically developed countries as Finland, Sweden or Norway. </div>
<div>
<p><b>HOW IT WORKS</b></p>
<p><b>We have to confess that what we have done so far was made exclusively by ourselves, hence there are no design specialists or developers in our team the following images are rather an explanation of the features than a finished prototype.  (THESE ARE ONLY A FEW IMAGES, THE APP IS MORE COMPLEX SOLUTION, HOWEVER INTUITIVELY EASY TO USE)</b></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1461937027/Mock_up_1_jg4vxy.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The app allows you to choose from the list the airport you depart from and the airport of your arrival, automatically calculating the total distance. One may also need to fill in the number of passengers as well as cabin class and press “Offset”. Done. It’s that easy! </p>
</div>
<div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1461937074/Mock_up_2_vg0kcr.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><b>Now all you have to do is to choose between types of renewable energy projects and continue. The app would show you how much it would cost to completely offset CO2 emissions from your flight which usually does not exceed a couple of bucks and take you to payment page. <u>Just a few clicks – and a great job of reducing greenhouse effect is done</u>! And think about it – it costs peanuts.</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1461937225/Mock_up_3_kowf5v.png"" src="""" style=""""/></b></p>
<b>We are going to make the process for you as easy and as fun as possible.</b>
</div>
<div><b>One of the features is global ranking or ranking by country. As well, all stats would be at hand with elements of gamification. You can always buy certificate for more CO2 or buy a gift certificate thus involving more people in our network!</b></div>
<div><b><b><u>Hard to think of something as easy as pie and as awesome possum! </u></b></b></div>
<h1>IN A NUTSHELL</h1>
<p><b>The Product</b><b>: </b>An innovative and unique tool that gives a possibility for every individual to take real action to reduce carbon emissions.</p>
<p>A step in the right direction to solving global warming problem and investing into green renewable technology.</p>
<p><b>Goals:</b></p>
<p><b>1.</b>To Expand and develop our current prototype app and a website.</p>
<p><b>2.</b>To involve in the process as many ecological organizations and influencers as possible but not only them, we plan to get commitment of tertiary sector too.  <b>3.</b>Reach <b><span>1</span></b><b>% of air travelers using our app within 3 years period</b>!</p>
<p><b>What your financial support will do:</b></p>
<p><b>1.</b>Enable the development of our prototype app, realizing it's full potential of being a comprehensive tool for offsetting carbon footprint of your air travels.</p>
<p><b>2.</b>Marketing the completed product to individuals, funds, companies and anyone who can get involved.</p>
<p><b>3.</b>Popularization of “green thinking” and “green doing” and making it a habit for many rather than a way of thinking for just a few. </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We have analysed the potential risks and believe that literally all of them can be minimized. <br/>One of the possible challenges is the transparency of investments' proper utilization. However we see how to deal with this risk to make all projects come to life. <br/>Firstly, all of the projects have been certified by either of the two most respected third-party standards in the world – United Nations’ CDM Standard and the Gold Standard (which are intensively audited on regular basis). <br/>Secondly, we plan to provide opportunity for anyone to implement constant control by means of access to live streaming video through our website.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
Hello, world! We are a team of young professionals willing to decrease the negative effect of human activity on our planet. We are multilingual and multinational, have absolutely various backgrounds in social and professional life. We are Olga from California, Alex from Russia, Andrei from Estonia and Hanna from Belarus. A little more details on who we are can be found further on or you can visit our website http://carbonfreetravel.com/. Now let us introduce you to our project.
 
THE PROBLEM  
 

 
We all know how great of a problem global warming is. Global temperatures keep increasing, mainly because of CO2 emissions from human activities. 
 

 
 
Aviation is one of the most harmful means of transportation for the environment. We all travel by plane from time to time, and huge amounts of CO2 are emitted. 
 
THE SOLUTION 
Our free app provides an opportunity to neutralize – or offset – those emissions. Every time you travel by plane a considerable amount of CO2 is emitted into the atmosphere. Using our app you can both offset these emissions and invest  into green energy projects – solar, wind or small hydro – around the world. 
 

 
 
Your modest contribution into these projects will prevent CO2 emissions in the future that are equal to CO2 emissions from your flight.BINGO – your carbon footprint from the flight is completely neutralized.  
THE EFFECT
By using our app you are not only offsetting your CO2 emissions, you help to create green jobs in developing countries, improve power supply and level of life locally.

For our backers we offer:

Everyone who donates regardless the sum of money would have the opportunity to try our App among the first users in the world and would have a unique version of it! 
As well, we shall mention each and every one of you our website among our sponsors. 
We shall send personalized postcards to everyone as well as give you great 1-100 tons of CO2 emissions offset certificates (on average every person produces around 5 tons of CO2 annually)    
If we manage to reach the goal, that would be the first step to help the whole project be a success, however if we don't manage to collect the necessary amount, we still would go on with the project, trying to get funds from all possible sources and get involved as many people as possible into this network. All the perks and pledges would still be provided to the backers.



The Impact

If just 5% of air travelers will use our app, we’ll be able to achieve amazing results:
-  That would offset 45 million tons of CO2 a year. Is it much or little?
-  1,8 billion trees absorb this much CO2 a year!
-  200 million people would breathe entire year to exhale this much CO2!
-  12 million cars off the road – that’s the effect (total number of cars in the state of New-York, or half of all vehicles in a huge country like Canada!)That much CO2 is emitted by such economically developed countries as Finland, Sweden or Norway. 

HOW IT WORKS
We have to confess that what we have done so far was made exclusively by ourselves, hence there are no design specialists or developers in our team the following images are rather an explanation of the features than a finished prototype.  (THESE ARE ONLY A FEW IMAGES, THE APP IS MORE COMPLEX SOLUTION, HOWEVER INTUITIVELY EASY TO USE)

The app allows you to choose from the list the airport you depart from and the airport of your arrival, automatically calculating the total distance. One may also need to fill in the number of passengers as well as cabin class and press “Offset”. Done. It’s that easy! 



Now all you have to do is to choose between types of renewable energy projects and continue. The app would show you how much it would cost to completely offset CO2 emissions from your flight which usually does not exceed a couple of bucks and take you to payment page. Just a few clicks – and a great job of reducing greenhouse effect is done! And think about it – it costs peanuts.
 

We are going to make the process for you as easy and as fun as possible.

One of the features is global ranking or ranking by country. As well, all stats would be at hand with elements of gamification. You can always buy certificate for more CO2 or buy a gift certificate thus involving more people in our network!
Hard to think of something as easy as pie and as awesome possum! 
IN A NUTSHELL
The Product: An innovative and unique tool that gives a possibility for every individual to take real action to reduce carbon emissions.
A step in the right direction to solving global warming problem and investing into green renewable technology.
Goals:
1.To Expand and develop our current prototype app and a website.
2.To involve in the process as many ecological organizations and influencers as possible but not only them, we plan to get commitment of tertiary sector too.  3.Reach 1% of air travelers using our app within 3 years period!
What your financial support will do:
1.Enable the development of our prototype app, realizing it's full potential of being a comprehensive tool for offsetting carbon footprint of your air travels.
2.Marketing the completed product to individuals, funds, companies and anyone who can get involved.
3.Popularization of “green thinking” and “green doing” and making it a habit for many rather than a way of thinking for just a few.

Risks & Challenges
We have analysed the potential risks and believe that literally all of them can be minimized. One of the possible challenges is the transparency of investments' proper utilization. However we see how to deal with this risk to make all projects come to life. Firstly, all of the projects have been certified by either of the two most respected third-party standards in the world – United Nations’ CDM Standard and the Gold Standard (which are intensively audited on regular basis). Secondly, we plan to provide opportunity for anyone to implement constant control by means of access to live streaming video through our website.


You Can Help!
We are thinking globally but acting locally, so your investment may help not only to offset carbon emissions but also influence millions of peoples’ lives in different regions of the world.

We now need your support to bring our vision of establishing an easy and affordable new standard in personal safety into reality .Find more information at the ProteGear website https://www.protegear.de/english/ RISKSThe SmartSafety Service is already working and operating on various places around the world since 2014, with different hardware (trackers) from third parties (operating in Europe, Brazil, Morocco, Egypt, Antarctica, Mauritius etc).As these trackers always had some limitations (range, detection of crash, reliability of connection, costs etc) in 2015 we decided to start the development of our own hardware which combines GSM (2G), UMTS (3G) or LTE (4G) and Iridium connectivity in one device. This is the A*LIVE.There are already concepts and working prototypes available with 95% of the functionality we need, but not in the casing we have designed. It has been checked and tested by several very experienced outdoor sportsmen. All found the concept and functionality great.The next major steps are to match the electronic design with the casing to get it 100% waterproof as well as get the accompanied iOS & Android APP ready. We already have the waterproof standard of IP67 but we strive for IP68. We did our homework, checked, re-checked, tested and got everything ready to start the production of the first series of A*LIVE tools.3G/LTE features depend on availability of networks and hybrid modules for LTE-M1 or LTE-NB1 by late summer 2017So it is only a question of your support and time to get all parts fixed. Help us to reach a new level in personal safety standard! A perfect personal safety solution should not remain a privilege for specialists!",20.0,1,"1 Campaign

<p>To solve this problem, Miss Mayfly created a line of color-coordinating fishing gear products made exclusively for women. The Miss Mayfly Wader entered the market in 2018 and has swiftly gained popularity with it’s reputation of exceptional fit, performance, durability and flattering design, with a special emphasis on appropriate sizing for curvy, full and plus sizes. </p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Women's Fishing Gear- An Under Served Market</h3>
<p>Women are one of the fastest growing demographics in the outdoor space making up 32% of all anglers, totaling 9.8 million women and yet they are still an under-served market, often forcing them to either wear ill-fitting men’s gear or pay up to $900 for custom made waders. There are many women who simply can not enjoy the sport fully because the competitors gear does not meet the majority of women’s sizing and performance needs. Miss Mayfly's mission is to raise the industry standards for women by creating gear that empowers women to enjoy the sport.  </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1560016975/c6hfpxdvf7wabss3mbnv.png"" src=""""/></p>

<h3 style=""margin-left:80px;""> Women Anglers Struggle with Gear Barriers</h3>
<p>Typically, women's wader sizing is created in a mirrored system of the men's scale, but as we all know, women's bodies are very different than men's. Fitting many body sizes and foot sizes together into appropriate fitting gear, while maintaining low SKU's and shelf space, is quite hard to accomplish, but Miss Mayfly has figured it out! To solve this dilemma Miss Mayfly has created an innovative sizing system that fits women up to 61"" width in just 12 sizes, while the leading brands only fit up to 45-48"".                     </p>
<p>                <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1560016048/x9ukhr0bgvygtioafbj8.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/>                                                                                            Gear is a common barrier that women face when entering the sport. Usually waders are scaled by height, coming in standard, petite, tall and then they might throw in a plus size. The problem this creates is that the sizes scale along with a foot size so that the bigger the wader, the bigger the bootie is. This doesn't account for women with full bodies and small feet, women with small bodies and large feet, or any of the women in-between.</p>
<p>     </p>
<p>The Same fit and sizing problems persist throughout most women's gear products. Adding a 'girly"" color to a man's product doesn't improve it's performance for women. Tackle bags are big, bulky and heavy. The straps don't allow for freedom of movement or consider a woman's curves. Wading boots are over-sized to accommodate the over-sized booties. The shirts don't consider coverage for the in-between stops along a fishing journey and they definitely do not consider that women come in various shapes and sizes.  </p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><b>Miss Mayfly Designs Products that Women Anglers Need</b></h3>
<p>​Miss Mayfly's innovative wader sizing system breaks the sizing barriers by creating 4 body types for each bootie size range. So now no matter what body type a woman has, there is a bootie to fit. The tailored fit of our plush neoprene bootie, allows for an expanded  bootie size range, fitting sizes from 6 to 11.  The body types are offered in Slim, Curvy, Full and Plus, with the largest sizes fitting up to 61"" in hip widths, making Miss Mayfly the largest women's sizing option on the market. </p>

<p><strong>Kim Ranalla, founder and designer at Miss Mayfly, explains:</strong> <i>“As an angler myself,  I am very passionate about women's diversity within the fishing industry. I have set out on a mission to make sure all women are accounted for by developing solutions for women’s common gear problems that often interfere with their ability to fully enjoy the sport. The key to our  wader sizing solution is our Polyflex fabric which is flexible, lightweight and moves comfortably with a woman’s body. Our customers rave about how easily they can move, bend and sit in them while they state that they feel like they are wearing their favorite pair of jeans. Miss Mayfly has put the same women-focused thought into all of our product designs and we are extremely proud to introduce these fabulous products that so many women need""!</i></p>

<p><strong>Taking Body Measurements: </strong> The most important measurement is the hip, followed by the others. The least important is height . When taking measurements, take them while wearing the thickest layers you would wear with your wader, such as winter layers. Do not stretch the measuring tape tight, let it lay naturally. If you do not have a fabric measuring tape, you can use a belt, rope, string etc, mark it and measure it out with a ruler.</p>
<p><strong>Hip:</strong> Take your hip measurement around the fullest part of rear at hip joint.</p>
<p><strong>Waist:</strong> Take your waist measurement at or 1 inch above the navel.</p>
<p><strong>Bust:</strong> This is not your bra size. Take the measurement around fullest part of bust</p>
<p><strong>Inseam:</strong> Waders only extend to the mid inside ankle, not to the floor. Take this measurement from center crotch to center inside ankle. </p>
<p><strong>Bootie:</strong> Is equal to your standard US shoe size. </p>
<p><strong>Recommended Height:</strong> Although we have a recommended height range for best fit, we do so to simply help you decide which size will give you the ""best"" fit, so if you picked the best size and are an inch or two over or under in height, it will still fit you. Just trust us.</p>

<p><strong>Choosing the best size: </strong>To choose a size, find the correct bootie size and then pick out a corresponding body type.</p>
<p><strong>Bootie/Body Match:</strong> We have designed our sizes so you can scale up and down the bootie size by 1 shoe size. If you fall into an odd sizing combination, find the body that fits you first and choose the bootie size that is closest.

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">For Supporting Women Anglers!!!</h2>
<p> </p>
</div></div>","Miss Mayfly Waders Are SO Wonderful that Even Men Want to Wear Them!
Bobbie Turner, a fly angler from British Columbia, states:
“What Miss Mayfly has created is something really wonderful. Now my husband and his friends are complaining “Hey we don’t have that”! “Too bad” says Bobbie.
 

 
As female anglers, the Miss Mayfly team struggled to find gear that fit, performed & looked flattering 
To solve this problem, Miss Mayfly created a line of color-coordinating fishing gear products made exclusively for women. The Miss Mayfly Wader entered the market in 2018 and has swiftly gained popularity with it’s reputation of exceptional fit, performance, durability and flattering design, with a special emphasis on appropriate sizing for curvy, full and plus sizes. 
 

 
Women's Fishing Gear- An Under Served Market
Women are one of the fastest growing demographics in the outdoor space making up 32% of all anglers, totaling 9.8 million women and yet they are still an under-served market, often forcing them to either wear ill-fitting men’s gear or pay up to $900 for custom made waders. There are many women who simply can not enjoy the sport fully because the competitors gear does not meet the majority of women’s sizing and performance needs. Miss Mayfly's mission is to raise the industry standards for women by creating gear that empowers women to enjoy the sport.  




 Women Anglers Struggle with Gear Barriers
Typically, women's wader sizing is created in a mirrored system of the men's scale, but as we all know, women's bodies are very different than men's. Fitting many body sizes and foot sizes together into appropriate fitting gear, while maintaining low SKU's and shelf space, is quite hard to accomplish, but Miss Mayfly has figured it out! To solve this dilemma Miss Mayfly has created an innovative sizing system that fits women up to 61"" width in just 12 sizes, while the leading brands only fit up to 45-48"".                     
                                                                                                            Gear is a common barrier that women face when entering the sport. Usually waders are scaled by height, coming in standard, petite, tall and then they might throw in a plus size. The problem this creates is that the sizes scale along with a foot size so that the bigger the wader, the bigger the bootie is. This doesn't account for women with full bodies and small feet, women with small bodies and large feet, or any of the women in-between.
     
The Same fit and sizing problems persist throughout most women's gear products. Adding a 'girly"" color to a man's product doesn't improve it's performance for women. Tackle bags are big, bulky and heavy. The straps don't allow for freedom of movement or consider a woman's curves. Wading boots are over-sized to accommodate the over-sized booties. The shirts don't consider coverage for the in-between stops along a fishing journey and they definitely do not consider that women come in various shapes and sizes.  
 
Miss Mayfly Designs Products that Women Anglers Need
​Miss Mayfly's innovative wader sizing system breaks the sizing barriers by creating 4 body types for each bootie size range. So now no matter what body type a woman has, there is a bootie to fit. The tailored fit of our plush neoprene bootie, allows for an expanded  bootie size range, fitting sizes from 6 to 11.  The body types are offered in Slim, Curvy, Full and Plus, with the largest sizes fitting up to 61"" in hip widths, making Miss Mayfly the largest women's sizing option on the market. 

                                                                                                                                                                                        No one knows a woman anglers needs as well as a woman angler.  100% of our products are designed by female anglers who know exactly what works and what doesn't work, what women want and what women don't want. How do we know better than the big competitors? Because we  listen to our sister anglers needs and focus all of our time and resources to developing gear solutions just for them.  
Miss Mayfly utilizes lightweight fabrics, streamlined designs with superb functionality, and are sized to optimize a woman's freedom of movement. 
 
Kim Ranalla, founder and designer at Miss Mayfly, explains: “As an angler myself,  I am very passionate about women's diversity within the fishing industry. I have set out on a mission to make sure all women are accounted for by developing solutions for women’s common gear problems that often interfere with their ability to fully enjoy the sport. The key to our  wader sizing solution is our Polyflex fabric which is flexible, lightweight and moves comfortably with a woman’s body. Our customers rave about how easily they can move, bend and sit in them while they state that they feel like they are wearing their favorite pair of jeans. Miss Mayfly has put the same women-focused thought into all of our product designs and we are extremely proud to introduce these fabulous products that so many women need""!

WHAT HAPPENS IF WE DO NOT REACH OUR GOAL?
BACK UP PLAN
In the case that we do not reach our goal, we have secured a line of credit to ensure that we are able to manufacture the products and deliver your perks. However, the line of credit is expensive so the campaign funds will be used to offset the cost of production while we seek an equity investor to fund our future operational, sales and marketing costs. If you have any questions or comments please email us at customerservices@missmayfly.com

<p>Demand is there:</p>
<p>According to Chicago Tribune, ""Whether it be for business or pleasure, visitors poured into Chicago at record-breaking levels last year 2018, with 57.6 million visitors — a 4.3 percent jump over 2017’s record of 55.2 million. There is definitely lost of people getting around.</p>
<p><strong>Successful Market Research</strong></p>
<p>Our market research was very successful and everyone loved the idea and ready to back our campaign. We are confident we will sell out fast.</p>
<p>Question was not about demand but about our price point. We are priced at our break even point, a bare minimum, lowest price. Starting at $10, you get one full day limo pass of city of Chicago. You get unlimited pickup and drop off between 10:30am-4:30pm everyday, 7 days a week.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>What we need and what you get?</strong></p>
<p>We need to reach our minimum goal of $120k . This funds go to pay for the drivers, gas and cover financing of 5 limousine payments for 120 days or 4 months. It is bare minimum, where we break even without including overhead costs, taxes or any other expenses. </p>
<p>Starting at $10 per person, you will get unlimited pickup and drop off for one full day, from attraction to attraction, any points on the preset routes. Like Double deck bus or free trolly, or boat, or segway tour, they all go around a preset route.</p>
<p>There are many perks to choose from at different support levels. </p>
<p>If we do not reach our goal any contribution or pledge you have made... you will get full credit 100% toward any limousine service you use through our other limousine services like airport pickup or drop and anything you may desire and your credit will never expire. It is also transferable to anyone you choose,  you will never use any of your money. Just hold on to your receipt or proof of payment.</p>
<p>You will get unlimited pickup and drop off for all day from attraction to attraction, or to your hotel, restaurant or any place in downtown Chicago in limousine for only $18. Hold on to your wallet yet. I know it is a awesome deal but wait a little bit for us to explain in details. I promise, you will get your chance to purchase our offer. </p>
<p>Not only you will help us launch this project but help create a wonderful memory for other people.  Just looking at a limousine or being inside one gives you that excitement and different state of mind and emotion. It might recall your memory of high school prom or, birthday, or wedding, your first date or special event.</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The impact your are creating is that late model limousines will be a part of everyday Chicago experience. It will be only such limousine service offered, in action in the world. Tours will love Chicago even more and help bring more tourist to the city.</p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Anything you do in life there is always risk and challenges.  I want you to understand that you are not only one making commitment here. We actually have much bigger commitment than you are. Minimum support from one person is about $18 yet you will get full credit toward using our other limousine services in case this project does not reach our goal or launch. </p>
<p>Because of the initial purchase cost of a new or newer limousine, we need to have this project go on for at least next three years. Why? Let's say we purchased new limo at $85k and need to pay it off in three years. That is where you get minimum three years.</p>
<p>We can't purchase new limo and use it only for 4-5 months and have no business after that. The biggest challenge on our end would not be financing of a however many limousine we need for the project but find and hiring good limousine drivers. To drive these limousine in the city of Chicago one must have chauffeurs license. </p>
<p>We have a great company behind us, American Coach limousine will  do our all the limousine pickups not related to Chicago limousine tour. They have over 200 cars including sedans, SUVs and party buses. </p>
<p>AutoCab will do our software side of the business and it will be similar to shared ride apps like Uber and Lyft. Customers be able to see where limousines are and when they are arriving as well as be able to make a reservations. </p>
<p>We have few companies to do financing side of this project. They will do the financing and we will lease or purchase limousine from them for this project.</p>
<p>Everyone can make this project a success even though you may be in a different part of the world and not visiting Chicago any times soon, but just getting the words out there will help your friends, relatives, someone be able to experience Chicago in this unique way, riding a limousine</p>

We created new virus-risk free tours for you and your family, in nature rich locations where contact with other people is limited to the minimum and the prevention measures are being taken to the highest levels.
We created a new segment on our tour business, where while we understand the social awareness of the population regarding causes in need and the simultaneous desire to enjoy life to the fullest, we organised combo Solidarity/Vacation trips for many different causes to find the closest to your heart, while being able to enjoy your vacations during the same period/trip. The goal is to allow you to have an active participation on charity while still living your dream vacations, increasing your personal satisfaction and decreasing your overall costs.

Our solidarity tours are divided into three categories, depending on the objective to be achieved and the type of help required in that location, as well as the one you identify with the most.

<p>Hi, I’m Audrey.</p>
<p><strong>I’m a mother, surfer, lawyer, and entrepreneur.</strong></p>
<p>After years of surf travel and spending nearly every single day at the beach, it all came down to a hot day in July as I crossed the US/Mexico border with a car seat on my head and a boxy, non-collapsible cooler weighing me down.</p>
<p>After that, I looked everywhere but I couldn't find a soft cooler that was lightweight, packable, but not made from cheap plastic or super ugly.</p> <p><strong>Why The Coolio? </strong></p>
<p>Last year, during COVID, life became all about micro-adventures.  My family and I couldn't travel to far-flung surf destinations, but we could enjoy our local beaches, parks, and hikes with a picnic and a cold beverage.  COVID taught me that I couldn't count my blessings, that's how the slogan ""Make Everyday Count"" came about.  The Coolio is exactly what you need to carry supplies on your everyday adventures and not miss a chance to celebrate, no matter what life throws your way.  </p>
<p>That's why I built the Coolio. </p>
<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1620181773/pxwmkbebdvrvdh9iozme.jpg"" src=""""/></h3>
<h3> </h3>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Everything You Need, Nothing You Don't</h2>
<p>In our experience, when it comes to coolers, less is definitely more.  Coolers with too many bells and whistles break easily, are rarely used, and when they do, they get trashed.  At Everyday Makai, we believe in simple design that works.  </p>

</div></div>","Meet the Coolio, the lightweight cooler for everyday adventurers.  
Nobody likes lugging a bulky cooler to the beach, on trips, or on the trail. We designed a versatile, slim, discreet cooler made from recycled materials so you can Make Everyday Count with frosty cold drinks, fresh food, and clean ice.



 

A Lighter, Simpler Cooler
For Better Everyday Adventures
 

Hi, I’m Audrey.
I’m a mother, surfer, lawyer, and entrepreneur.
After years of surf travel and spending nearly every single day at the beach, it all came down to a hot day in July as I crossed the US/Mexico border with a car seat on my head and a boxy, non-collapsible cooler weighing me down.
After that, I looked everywhere but I couldn't find a soft cooler that was lightweight, packable, but not made from cheap plastic or super ugly. Why The Coolio? 
Last year, during COVID, life became all about micro-adventures.  My family and I couldn't travel to far-flung surf destinations, but we could enjoy our local beaches, parks, and hikes with a picnic and a cold beverage.  COVID taught me that I couldn't count my blessings, that's how the slogan ""Make Everyday Count"" came about.  The Coolio is exactly what you need to carry supplies on your everyday adventures and not miss a chance to celebrate, no matter what life throws your way.  
That's why I built the Coolio. 

 
Everything You Need, Nothing You Don't
In our experience, when it comes to coolers, less is definitely more.  Coolers with too many bells and whistles break easily, are rarely used, and when they do, they get trashed.  At Everyday Makai, we believe in simple design that works.  

Perfect for a Sunset Session
Holds 3 Bottles of Wine, 10 Cans + Snacks and Separate Ice 
 
3 Comfortable Ways to Carry
By reinforced handles, throw over your shoulder, sling cross-body
 
Leakproof, For Reals
Waterproof Exterior, Water-Tight Interior, Badass Zipper
 
Easy to Clean
Simply wipe down with a damp cloth
 


The Coolio is meant to go with you... Everywhere.  Life is too short, we don't want you to miss a thing because you don't have a snack or a drink. 
 
The Perfect Travel Companion
We got sick and tired of cooler-woes while traveling,  The choice between buying a cheap styrofoam or crappy plastic cooler when we arrived at our destination or lugging a bulky, non-collapsible soft cooler all over the world just plain sucked.

Because You Love Pockets...
 Easy organization to stash things away but not out of reach. Plus, a safe home for your clean ice for drinks or easily squished fruit.

it?Well, you can’t put a price on healthy, glowy skin!!!Not only that, but we've also sourced with sustainability and ethics in mind.Our materials are high-quality, upcyclable/recyclable, and sustainably dyed to ensure that traveling in style doesn't compromise the environment.And our amazing production partner with over 40 years of experience has shown us how they put people over profits when it comes to their health and safety during these times!Besides, maintaining your skincare and beauty routine while you travel is difficult.You make the decision to leave your things behind by telling yourself that your sister has great stuff you can use…Or, maybe you’ve tried to “pack light” and only bring a few things, thinking that it would be less of a headache to deal with on vacation.But, anything that’s not YOUR complete routine will break you out and your healthy, glowy skin is broken out, unhappy, and irritated...And it can take MONTHS to recover after what was supposed to be your ""relax and restoration"" period . . .Spring Green will be available when we meet our first stretch goal of $10K!The On-the-Go Organizer is a MAJOR upgrade over most toiletry and cosmetics bags!It organizes and can store even the most sizable, complicated skincare and beauty routine in a totally antimicrobial space that is chic and compact.Whether you’re in Manhattan or Milan, you’ll have no excuses but to keep up with your regimen!Because our mission is to make sure you feel beautiful inside and out no matter where you are in the world.And you know, our skincare and beauty products need to travel with us more than we realize!We're always on the move, not just when we're on vacation — so, we've sourced the best materials to ensure On-the-Go will stand up to the amazing adventures you'll go on.As Seen In . . . (Download our Press Kit HERE)Become an affiliate during our campaign:What others are saying about On-the-Go:This is the SAME bag holding ALL this stuff.Keep everything inside and accessible.Clear pockets are perfect for smaller items (also antimicrobial)Traditional hanging toiletry bags are just focused on being containers of stuff.On top of being made of absorbent and difficult to clean (and keep clean) fabrics, there’s no organization or segmentation of your shower products, morning makeup, or night routine.And I hated the idea of having to sprawl out all my stuff across the bathroom counter or shower of a hotel!Truth be told, I’m a bit of a germaphobe...So, all I can think about is how your stuff harbors all those germs and bacteria, which make their way onto your hands and face and eventually onto your clothes...And if you’re staying at a hotel, then you know that the cleaning staff typically has 30 minutes to clean your entire suite due to daily quotas.There's no way that they can do a thorough clean!The market was missing an antimicrobial toiletry bag that you could use WITHOUT taking everything out while still being able to find what you need easily!So, I got to work on my dream beauty travel case that would address all my concerns as a skincare and beauty lover!That's me, Diane! (Learn a little more about me here)I’m Diane Chang, the founder and Creative Director of Akushio, a sustainable specialty brand for skincare and beauty lovers, and I’ve struggled with acne since I was eleven years old.In my quest for clear skin, I became more and more interested in skincare and makeup as tools for self-care and creativity — not something I had to do for validation of my self-worth.As I came out of my shell, I found a love for traveling! But, packing was always something I struggled with, especially in the toiletries and cosmetics department.Not only is the size of my collection daunting and overwhelming to sort through, but I’m also not the most organized!And if you’ve tried to use your skincare savvy friend’s stuff or cut things out of your own routine like myself, then you understand the frustration of breaking out while you’re supposed to be enjoying your time off...So, I started designing what would be the perfect solution to a major beauty girl's sensitive skin and her disgust for germs and bacteria in the dirtiest room of any hotel: the bathroom.The very first concept sketch!Official concept sketch:1. Grab On-the-Go to have one of the two compartments facing you.2. Open said compartment (easy enough yet?)We recommend filling the mesh pockets first with smaller items that don't stand up on their own (psst... the mesh pockets on the side are perfect for droppers).3. Fill the center with all your must-haves!4. Place smaller items, like your toothbrush, tweezers, or even cosmetics in the clear pockets.Easy to clean and see where all your things are!Easily accessible when the On-the-Go Organizer is fully open.Or half way closed — making it super easy to place on top of the bathroom counter!Zipper at the top means you don't have to fidget around for your stuff!Whether you keep On-the-Go fully open or closed, you have access to everything.TIP: Have something that requires you to take the cap off, but not sure where to put it?Mesh pocket over the clear one is a CAP HOLDER. Never place a thing on the gross bathroom counter!You have the mesh cap pocket to hold it on the bathroom counter or hanging in the shower!It's also treated with SILVADUR™ and GreenShield® Stain Protection, so it's just as easy to clean and keep clean — thanks to the antimicrobial and water-and-oil resistant properties.See how easy it is to grab what you need?Forgot something in the clear pockets, but don't want to open everything back up? Fret not! Your items are still accessible even when the bag is fully closed.5. When you're headed into the shower, pull out the hanging hook in the hidden compartment!Final product will have a swivel brass hanger!Slip pocket is perfect to stow away discretely! Manufactured in Japan by a US and UK-based company, this polyurethane (PU) leather is infused with silver-ion technology that makes maintenance low and hassle-free!Water-resistant and durable, this PU leather won't crack or wear down like real leather.And what's great is that the manufacturing process does not include PVC and plasticizers, reuses the silver-ions and water (a huge issue in the fashion industry), and is certified by SCS Global Services for Air Quality.You won't have to worry about the bacteria and germs from your hotel bathroom since it is easy to wipe clean of stains and not worry about bacteria and germs making their way to you — compare all of those requirements to the porous and absorbent materials of other toiletry bags!Luxuriously soft, yet incredibly resilient against tough stains.Simply wipe clean with alcohol!Not only does this off-gold color look so chic against our Navy Blue and Spring Green faux leather, but it's also naturally antimicrobial thanks to the copper, which also makes it one of the easier metal alloys to maintain against water stains!NOTE: Final Product will have a swiveling brass hanger!!These treatments make taking care of your On-the-Go Organizer easy, effective, and hassle-free!SILVADUR™ maintains the freshness of the recycled polyester and nylon fabrics. Silver ions are meant to disrupt the replication process of bacteria and germs, so you never have to worry about unwanted things growing where they shouldn't be!And best of all, the application process recycles and reuses all materials, saving both water and energy :)GreenShield® Stain Protection is a low fluorocarbon nanoparticle-based water and stain repellent finish, inspired by a plant leaf and how it allows water and oil droplets to roll right off.Using up to ten times less fluorocarbons and a third of the chemicals, this finish is the preferred moisture and stain-resistant finish amongst the natural, eco-friendly community!Look at the suspended water droplets!

<p>My name is Damir Zupanovic and I am a passionate angler and nature lover. During my fishing trips I often have to conquer uninhabited and sometimes harsh environment, especially during the winter fishing season. You can never predict what can happen in the wilds, and, after a few ""incidents"" I decided to make my weekend fishing trips safer and the idea of <strong>Trailblazer Survival Kit</strong> was born. It is funny how we sometimes don`t think about our own safety until one day we find ourselves in a life-threatening situation! After the research and after getting advice from survival experts, the contents of the survival kit was completed. I also want to make this kit available to everyone because I cannot emphasize enough the importance of being safe, warm, with shelter over your head and with food &amp; water supply when you are stranded deep, alone in the unknown territory, with only your personal belongings, skills and luck by your side. <strong>Trailblazer Survival Kit</strong> turns the odds in your favor in these situations and really becomes your best friend in emergency situations. It is also a kit you can keep and store in your home, knowing you`ll be ready if any disaster strikes.</p>

<p> </p>
<h3>FAQ:</h3>
<p><strong>1. Does Trailblazer Survival Kit has all that I really need?</strong><br/>Trailblazer Survival Kit contains tools &amp; gadgets essential for your survival. It does not contain bottled water, canned food, energy bars, warm clothes, underwear and things like that. You should add those things to the backpack yourself.</p>
<p><strong>2. Is it all too heavy to carry on your back?</strong><br/>When you look at the list of stuff you get with the Trailblazer Survival Kit, it is easy to imagine you need a pack mule to carry it for you. But, in fact, all the tools and gadgets were carefully selected and the weight of each tool was extremely important so that the whole kit is easy to carry on your back. Hiker Edition weighs only 2.5 kg (88 oz) and the Survivor Edition weighs 5.1 kg (180 oz). The backpack itself weighs only 600-700 grams (approx. 24 oz). So, you don`t need to be afraid that it will be heavy or that it will slow you down - it is easy enough for anyone to carry.</p>
<p><strong>3. Is the backpack too big for a girl?</strong><br/>No, the backpack is the ideal size for men and women. It is the perfect size and, more important, perfect width. We strongly encourage not to put stuff on the outside of the backpack that will make the backpack wider. When you face the narrow corridor, any thing you have on your backpack that is wider than your body will present an obstacle and it could be harder for you to get through.</p>
<p><strong>4. How can I charge my phone or other gadget while I`m in the wilds?</strong><br/>Yes, you can use our handcrank / solar radio/flashlight/charger to charge your phone, waterproof LED headlamp, GPS tracker or any other device that operates on 5V or uses micro USB connection.</p>
<p><strong>5. How does the Life Straw Water Purifier work?</strong><br/>Life Straw has a 2-stage filtration process. The activated carbon filter removes some chemicals like chlorine and the hollowfiber micro filter removes 99.9999% of bacteria and 99.9% of protozoa. It also reduces turbidity, filtering down to 0.2 microns. The activated carbon filter removes some chemicals (like chlorine) and some pesticides and fertilizers.</p>
<p><strong>6. How can I start the fire with Fresnel Lens?</strong><br/>Move the fresnel lens closer and farther from what you’re trying to light (dry leaves, tinder,...) until the focused light spot is smallest. Then flex the sheet to make the light spot as small as you can get it. The smaller the focused light is, the higher the density of light there is, so the hotter it will get. You’d want to have your kindling and the rest of your wood close by so it could catch before the leaves go out. In some cases, you’ll want to move the light around a bit to catch more of the leaves on fire, especially if you have clouds coming.</p>
<p><strong>If you have more questions, <a href=""mailto:zupanovicdamir@gmail.com?subject=Trailblazer%20Survival%20Kit%20-%20IndieGoGo"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">please ask</a>, we will be more than happy to answer them :)</strong></p>

<p>My wife, kids and I love road trips, and we’ve tackled routes all over the southwest, midwest and northeast.</p>
<p>So this is a blog post idea I love and have personally searched for (and written about) over the years.</p>
<p>This is also a great blog post category because of the number of variations you can include in your itineraries.</p>
<p>A road trip with kids in the southwest, for example, looks a lot different than an romantic outdoorsy road trip in the Pacific Northwest.</p>
<p>You can also throw in all sorts of helpful content, including where to stay, what to eat and the best times to plan your road trip.</p>
<p>  3. Weekend trips  </p>
<p>Living in Phoenix, we’re also big on weekend trips – anywhere to get out of the heat during the summer.</p>
<p>Weekend trip posts are great because you can string together a few places together, or focus on one city or destination.</p>
<p>Example: The best weekend getaways from NYC</p>
<p>  4. Scenic drives  </p>
<p>Like road trips, scenic drives are a great topic because of the endless variation and customization you can add to your content.</p>
<p>Just about every region or state gets searches related to scenic drives, so this is an easy one to cover wherever you live or travel.</p>
<p>Example: Famous Roads for Great Drives in California</p>
<p>  5. Train rides   </p>
<p>Train rides have a romantic throwback vibe that make them a timeless classic in the world of travel blogging.</p>
<p>You can review a specific route, or curate a list of the best train rides in a region.</p>
<p>Example: 7 of the Best Train Trips in Canada and What You’ll See Along the Way</p>
<p>  6. Dog-friendly trips  </p>
<p>Traveling with four-legged friends isn’t always easy, so many travelers find it helpful to look up things to do and places to stay with their dogs.</p>
<p>For more ideas on traveling with pets, check out BringFrido, a directory for travelers with dogs.</p>
<p>Example: 19 Texas Attractions You Won’t Believe Are Dog-Friendly</p>
<p>  7. Public transportation options  </p>
<p>In big cities or foreign countries, travelers like to know which public transportation options are best.</p>
<p>You can also write about places where it’s best to get a rental car, or where you’ll want to rely heavily on subways, taxis or walking.</p>
<p>This can be part of a larger “what to do” article, but if you find a place that has enough options and content, it can work as a standalone article.</p>
<p>Example: Tips for Getting Around in Rome</p>
<p>Things to Do (or Not!)</p>
<p>  8. Things to do with kids  </p>
<p>Traveling with kids – especially babies and toddlers – brings a whole new level of research and prep work to the table, even for quick weekend trips.</p>
<p>The first few trips my wife and I took with our baby twins were a real wake-up call compared to the casual, jam-packed trips we normally took as a couple.</p>
<p>Fortunately for blogger, this means lots of content opportunities for travelers with kids.</p>
<p>In addition to things to do, you can also look at where to eat with kids or which places are kid-appropriate.</p>
<p>Example: 100 Things To Do in NYC with Kids Before They Grow Up</p>
<p>  9. Things to do at night  </p>
<p>Most travel destinations have laundry lists of things to do, but things to do at night is a different story.</p>
<p>These might by more nightlife-based attractions, but it also may include tours and places to see that are best at nighttime.</p>
<p>This particular article is great for big cities with a lot going on – think New York City, Barcelona, Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Example: Things to Do at Night in Barcelona</p>
<p>  10. Things to do alone  </p>
<p>Solo travelers need ideas too, and this is a great way to niche down into a unique “things to do article.”</p>
<p>These articles can include places to visit, where to eat and where to stay if you’re traveling solo.</p>
<p>Example: NYC Solo Travel: 22 Things To Do Alone In NYC</p>
<p>  11. Things to do in specific seasons  </p>
<p>Travel attractions vary by place and season – what you do in NYC during the summer is a lot different than what you do there in the winter.</p>
<p>By covering one specific season, you’re able to make a useful, unique list of things to do that’s more helpful than a generic checklist that might not apply throughout the whole year.</p>
<p>Example: Beat the winter blues by visiting these Chicago attractions</p>
<p>  12. Romantic things to do  </p>
<p>There are a few variations here, but the idea with these articles is to write about things to do for couples.</p>
<p>Of course, there are more romantic places than others, but you’d be surprised to learn how many people are looking up stuff like “romantic things to do in Prescott,” which means you can write these types of posts for just about anywhere.</p>
<p>Example: Featured Itinerary: 48 Hours of Romance in Sedona</p>
<p>  13. Non-touristy things to do  </p>
<p>Here’s where this type of post gets really interesting: the tourist looking to do non-touristy things.</p>
<p>They’re tired of the same old attractions and want something off the beaten path. So give it to them!</p>
<p>If you’re relying just on research, this article can be difficult to write, but if you have firsthand knowledge of a place where you’ve explored non-touristy attractions, it’s a great way to differentiate your content.</p>
<p>It’s also a great topic to keep in mind for future travels – when you hit a new city, see if you can find under-the-radar attractions and places that would work well for this type of travel post.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Find the Coin is a treasure hunt to find the sixpence spliced into the first ever transatlantic communications cable, which transformed the way the world communicated forever.</p>
<p>Our mission is to find the coin, and in the process reclaim a central section of the cable. Join us as we make history.</p>
<p>We've found a boat, assembled the expedition team - all that's missing is you. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1615304877/zsg0dkpe8hw0zvv2tth8.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Pitch</h3>
<p>Few people realise that, over 150 years ago, before the American Civil War had even started, the first near instantaneous global communications were being born. The original, working transatlantic subsea communications cable was laid in 1858.</p>
<p>Cyrus West Field, a visionary entrepreneur, changed the way the world communicated forever by laying a cable from Eastern Newfoundland, to Western Ireland. For good luck, Cyrus welded a sixpence into a joint in the cable somewhere in the mid-Atlantic.</p>
<p>At the time, the fastest ships would take two weeks to send a message, this cable meant a full message could be relayed in hours. Its impact was immediate and revolutionary.</p>
<p>For the first time, the Old World was directly connected to the New World.</p>
<p>At the time, the event was celebrated on both sides of the Atlantic, with the Smithsonian Museum and others collecting and displaying much of the excess cable and Tiffany’s turning the cable into souvenir items, such as letter openers, paperweights, and walking cane handles.</p>
<p>The original cable has remained etched in the history of finance as well, introducing same day exchange rates and leading to the invention of the ticker. In fact, to this day USD/GBP currency pairing is still called “The Cable”.</p>
<p>People are often surprised to hear that over 99% of global communications still take place via the 3 million+ miles of undersea cables. The internet and related technologies we enjoy wouldn’t exist if it wasn’t for the early pioneers like Cyrus West Field.</p>
<p>This is the cable that changed the world, and you can be a part of the next chapter of its history.</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Team</h3>
<p><strong>Sebastian Stephens</strong></p>
<p>Sebastian spent 17 years in the undersea communications industry and left with one remaining mission to complete.... Recovering that coin!</p>
<p>He co-built Wisper – Europe's then-largest private data network – before selling it to Cable &amp; Wireless in 1999.</p>
<p>In 2000 he moved to the Caribbean, where he spent 8 years building the Southern Caribbean Fibre Network. In 2009 he co-founded SubSea Environmental Services, a recycling business buying, collecting and processing our service undersea cable on a continuous basis, which he led until 2015.</p>
<p><strong>Russell Parsons</strong></p>
<p>Russell is the other co-founder of Subsea Environmental Services and Wisper. Once a director of several international property development companies, he was the Finance Director of JFP – a property fund and specialist BES management business, which managed over 200 firms with £1.7bn of property assets. </p>
<p>Russell is also the founder and principal shareholder of Profusion Media – a data science, business intelligence and digital marketing agency based in London.</p>
<p><strong>Richard Wills</strong></p>
<p>Richard is a team member and advisor for the project, working closely with the team to bring it to life. He is also the Governor and Trustee of an independent school called Rendcomb College and has been farming organically for the last 20 years, as well as developing renewable energy projects and renovating buildings.</p>
<p><strong>Joe Wheatley</strong></p>
<p>Joe is the videographer on the project who will be filming the documentary. He has been working closely with Sebastian so far to build the story and is in some exciting talks already regarding the film.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Rewards</h3>
<p>From owning a small piece of the cable, to having your name on the boat as we go on our adventure, we have plenty of awards available that you can claim when backing our project.</p>
<p>Arguably the most exciting reward we have to offer is the unique piece of artwork, which we will be commissioning later on in the year once we reach our stretch goal. The artwork will depict the historic map of the 2 continents that were connected by the transatlantic telecommunications cable back in 1858 by Cyrus West Field. The artwork will feature elements of the cable’s material, and be a completely unique and valuable piece of history. It would also look great as a statement piece in a reception, or in your home/library.</p>
<p>We're working on the piece with the artists and will be able to share more details with you soon.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Our Stretch Goals</h3>
<p>We’d like to keep our adventure going for as long as possible to increase the chances of finding the coin, so here is what we will be able to do if we manage to exceed our initial goal.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1615304900/lftqaqzefpxa5mmv3n72.png"" src=""""/></p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The team behind this are founders of a successful subsea cable extraction company that has deep expertise in this specialist field. We don’t know if the coin is still there – that’s what makes it a treasure hunt!</p>
<p>However, we are very confident we’ll find the original cable and bring a significant section of it back. GPS coordinates were understandably unreliable in 1858, but we have a fair estimation of where the cable is. When we find it we will flip a coin and either go East or West and leave it up to fate. If not, we'll have to turn around and try again.</p>
<p>There is of course a possibility that someone else has already found it. But the fact we need to organise an exhibition like this demonstrates how difficult that would be to do under the radar.</p>
<p>We've already leased a boat for a short period in the summer, and your contribution will allow us to extend that lease and continue our treasure hunt for longer, giving us a better chance of finding the coin. </p>
<p>We’re confident of getting the cable, hopeful that we’ll find the coin, and are certainly the most experienced team possible to organise this treasure hunt!</p>

We had to realize, that all travel agencies and portals are basically the same.We have been working in the corporate tourism industry for decades and we have seen it all – especially the ruthless fight for clients by the big travel platforms and the enormous profit margin each travel platform makes, just by selling you a hotel room. Upon our research and the collected experiences, we discovered that each travel platform is making their profit the same way.Adding a percentage on each booking to maximize their profit and promoting it to you as the ultimate deal. All online travel platforms get more or less the same rates from the hotels, the wholesale price or in other words, the cost price. They just add whatever they feel the consumer will pay.Making a profit is positive as long as it is FAIR to the customer, wholesaler and as we think, is eco-friendly and gives something back to the global community.  When we founded this company we had one goal in mind, that nobody else considered possible: to cut off the many middle men in hotel reservation!

<li>Land Acquisition and Preparation: We need to purchase or lease suitable land and the equipment to make the land safe for play. That will include roping off the boundaries, creating paths, building structures and clearing out grasslands for the Arena.</li>
<li>Briefing Room:  We will be constructing a building to hold 50 people.  This is where everyone gets briefed on the rules and safety before heading out to the Arena.</li>
<li>Helmets and Pads: We want our players to be safe, so we are going to provide 50+ helmets, elbow pads and knee pads.</li>
<li>Weapon Construction: We put great care into each weapon we create to ensure they are safe for action.  All 250+ weapons will be handmade by us, and requires the purchase of proper materials. </li>
<li>Arena Construction: We will be building 50 podiums and the centerpiece that will hold all the weapons at the start of the game.</li>
<li>Safety Gear: To ensure that people will have the proper safety equipment, everyone will be given a map, compass, and storm whistle to signal in case of injury.</li>
<li>Insurance: Players will be covered by a general group insurance policy in case of accident. </li>
<li>Supply Crates: We have to build and paint 30 supply crates. </li>
