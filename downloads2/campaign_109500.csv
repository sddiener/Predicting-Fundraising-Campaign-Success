</div><p><b>Short Summary</b></p>
<p>Hi everyone! I’m Sophia. I’m
passionate about fantasy fiction and a couple of years back, I began writing
stories. </p>
<p>A few months ago, i had to leave my job because of debilitating pain issues. At the same time, I had this idea of
gifting people personalized fantasy stories. I started with gifting my friends
and they loved it. Then I decided I wanted to make it my business, if you can
call something so pleasurable that! </p>
<p>Fb page link: <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/fantastories42"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>www.facebook.com/fantastories42</span></a>
</p>
<p>See? It’s got 42 in it. It’s the
answer to the universe!</p>
<p>So far in the personalized gifting
market, we’ve got stories where the name is changed according to the customer’s
wishes. But with Fantastories, you just have to tell me a few facts about the
person to be gifted and I will create a delightful fantasy story around it,
design it nicely and get it printed. Since no one can ever be too old for
fantasy, stories are written for all age groups. You can view some sample
stories at the link above.</p>
<p>Apart from the highly personalized
stories, there will also be fixed stories where only names will be changed to
suit the wishes of the customer.</p>
<p><b>Reasons you should contribute:</b></p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>This is a relatively unique gifting idea that
few people know about. Gifting shouldn’t be generic. It should be made with a
lot of love which is what I do when I write any story. </p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>With digital stuff overtaking the
world, reading habits are dying. With your help to set up and promote, you
might just save it from extinction. One day books might just be as much a myth
as dragons. It is a scene to horrible to contemplate.  </p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Stories spread happiness and
personal stories even more so. Happier people will make the world a happier
place.</p>
<p><b>Setting up:</b></p>
<p>1.<span> 
</span>Although I have already started
Fantastories and received assignments, my current workspace is a netbook where I
cannot use designing software and have to depend on others. The cost of the
laptop I can work with: Rs 38,180 (around US$ 608 )<br/></p>
<p>2.<span> 
</span>I want to hire an illustrator to
make original illustrations for my stories.</p>
<p>3.<span> 
</span>While I have a logo in place, I want
the website designed. I have designed it on wix, but my design is simpler than
I’d like it to be. The cost of hiring a designer: Rs 1 lakh (around US$ 1557 )<br/></p>
<p>4.<span> 
</span>Apart from writing the stories, I want
to sell merchandise related to the stories. Like original superhero costumes, props,
stationery etc.</p>
<p>5.<span>  </span><span></span>A team of writers and designers will
have to be hired when Fantastories goes viral and demand increases
exponentially.</p>
<p><b>For promotion:</b></p>
<p>Digital is taking the world by storm
and it’s necessary for Fantastories to ride the wave to make the best of the
opportunities it presents.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Promoting the Facebook page and posts
require money pumped in to facebook whose algorithm is such that without investing money,
people would not be able to see the page. </p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>As the creator of Fantastories, my
busy schedule leaves me little time to regularly update the Facebook page. I
have to hire someone to handle the Facebook and Pinterest page and keep it
visible on timelines and fresh in memory. Cost of hiring someone: Rs 20,000 (around US$ 311 ) for a month.<br/></p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Social media campaigns need to be
created and promoted to generate buzz and excitement about Fantastories. Cost:
depends on the campaign. Will include cost of the campaign and cost of
promoting it</p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>Although Fantastories will be
available for everyone, the main market is children. Making personalized
stories the norm for parents instead of the generic stories in bookstores, will
generate maximum profit for Fantastories. Therefore ad campaigns will be
majorly aimed at this.</p><br/><p><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p><b>Risk:</b> It’s
a new concept so the public may take time to catch on to it.</p>
<p><b>Solution:</b> Before
I started Fantastories, I was working in advertising as a copywriter so I have
good idea of what it will take to publicize it and make it the norm for the
masses.</p><p><b>Challenge:</b> To bring scalability to Fantastories when demand goes high</p><p><b>Solution: </b>I will hire and train writers to write Fantastories<br/></p>
<p><b>Your contribution does not have to

<p>·<span> 
</span>I would welcome all the help I can
get if you’re a website designer willing to design my website.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>It would be great if you want to and
have the necessary skills to handle the social media pages.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Spread the word about Fantastories.</p>
<p>Please contribute! This is my only means of earning a living. Looking forward
to hearing from you. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>As an Industrial Designer, my job is to bring ideas to life. Somehow, that translated into bringing my Plushie Heroes came about by somehow bringing my travel companion to life through storytelling. Years ago, when I left home to study in Europe, I took my plushie travel companion with me. Everytime I would come back home, my little cousins would ask me about the adventures that Tyler had, while I was in school. I would make up bedtime stories for them and this tradition somehow brought Tyler to life. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Plushie Heroes has been on the works for years. It started out with a thought of turning my travel companion into the next ""Winnie the Pooh."" The first story has been written, and the illustrations have been drafted. To keep moving forward we need help with printing costs.  </p>
<p>We've tested out the charm of a plushie by creating a social media account, and have proudly gained a little bit of popularity within the community. We've even gained real friends and pen pals throughout the process. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Children's books are so important in a child's early development. Children's toys also earn a special bond with babies as they grow up. Using a plushie as a voice to teach kindness and life lessons can be effective.  For us this is just the beginning, we think that Plushie Heroes can be a series of stories, and one that we hope can be a part of future generation's lives. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We've never done a project like this before. As designers we're equipped with storytelling and problem-solving skills that comes in handy as we push through every challenges that a crowdfunding campaign and publishing a book might throw at us. </p>

<p>My name is J.T. McDaniel, and I write. I write books, I write plays, and now and then I write the odd essay. I'm officially retired, so I don't have much income these days. Back in the late 1960s, I did a tour in Vietnam with the 1st Aviation Brigade and the 101st Airborne Division. More recently, I've been a newspaper editor, an actor, and one of those nameless guys sitting in a cubicle. I also narrate audiobooks, though I don't plan to narrate the one I'm currently writing.</p>
<p>So, what's this campaign about? I'm writing a book. It's called <i>Returning</i>, and it's set 109 years in the future. When a giant spaceship shows up in orbit, people react differently. The Russians wonder if it's the prelude to an invasion. The British are nervous, but calm. The Americans dismiss it as propaganda, despite the fact that the ship is so big it can be seen from the ground without a telescope. It can't be real, the Americans say, because the people aboard it claim to come from the earth of 87,000 years ago, and everyone knows the earth is barely 6,000 years old. (<a href=""http://jtmcdaniel.com/return.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Read excerpts on my official site</a>.)</p>
<p>Why do I need money? Silly question, really. Authors like to eat. More pertinently, publishing a book means there are editing expenses, living expenses while writing (that eating thing), cover artists like to be paid, and, if you're doing a fund-raising campaign, there are perks to be paid for. </p>
<p>What sort of perks? For starters, everyone who contributes anything gets his/her name in the contributors section of the book. There will be thank you cards, digital and paperback copies of the finished book, tee-shirts, polo shirts, and even a few leather-bound copies for particularly generous patrons of the arts.</p>
<p>This started out as a fairly straightforward science fiction adventure book, if perhaps a little unusual in having a female starship captain. But I couldn't help noticing the trend in this country, the tendency for too many people to prefer an authoritarian solution to every problem, and the increasingly strong efforts of the religious right to force everyone else to comply with their views on every subject. Then, too, there is the new regime, which so far seems bent on running the country as a business. It sounds good in the abstract, but when actually applied the results are likely to be appalling, as government begins to value the citizenry not as individuals, but as disposable parts in a machine, to be discarded once they become old or infirm. The United States of Returning simply takes these tendencies and allows them to reach the inevitable result if they're not stopped. An evangelist has been President for 29 years, having or performing an abortion will get you executed, as will any homosexual conduct. Everyone pays an annual tax that goes, not to the government, but to their church. Blasphemy is punishable by jail time. A corner of Wyoming, invisible in all satellite images, contains a vast compound that has become the last stop for anyone who causes the government too much trouble. And a 15-year-old girl from Denver, who unwittingly becomes the first person to talk to the returning space travelers via HAM radio, ends up having the adventure of a lifetime once she manages to escape.</p>
<p>Why $10,000? Simply put, it's a combination of production needs and living expenses. Social Security doesn't pay very much. Good covers help book sales, but I think it's fairly obvious I'm not the best cover designer, nor do I have the artistic skills needed to pull off what this book needs. All books need editing. The audio version of this book will need a narrator, and while I do that sort thing, in this case I think a woman would be more appropriate.  </p>
<p>What happens if the goal isn't met? Obviously, I hope that it will be met, or even exceeded. Even if it isn't, it all helps. Everyone who contributes will still get their name in the book, and on my official website. Perks will still be produced and distributed. Things like cards and shirts should be sent out within 30 days of the campaign's end. Books may take a bit longer, since there's still some writing to do, and there's editing and production after that. </p>
<p>This book has an important story to tell. While it's wrapped in a science fiction tale, the story serves as a reminder that people, even politicians, sometimes mean exactly what they say. It's a reminder that ""he's just saying that to get elected"" isn't a reliable predictor of outcomes. Germans said that about Hitler's anti-Semitism, after all, and it turned out he meant it. It's a reminder that any democracy is a fragile thing, that people are too often willing to trade freedom for security (or the illusion of security). It's a reminder that many prefer an authoritarian government, which relieves them of the need to think, and that even ""good"" people can do horrible things in the name of conformity.</p>

<h3>Help us Share Daphne's Coloring Book</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Karen Black : </strong>Artist &amp; Author lives in Sullivan County, Pa. Although Self-taught during childhood, Karen received training from Masters from Society of Decorative Painting and a private Atelier. Karen specializes in murals, miniatures, and commissions of all sorts, and writing historical non-fiction. She loves the challenges of various mediums and venues.</li>
<li>
<strong>Kathleen Godwin : </strong>A child of Swedish immigrants grew up immersed in the arts of all kinds. Her sisters and Kathleen, when young, performed as the Jonsonn Sisters. In college she fell in love and married a brilliant creative Irishman. After 31 years and his passing Kathleen moved to Southeastern Pennsylvania and still enjoys theater, music, song and dance.</li>
<li> <strong>Daphne</strong> was born one memorable evening and her subsequent sporadic appearances during Kathleen's first marriage were always joyful, sometimes hilariously funny, occasionally bittersweet, but  always appreciated.  </li>
<li>
<strong>Coloring Book : </strong>By creating an adult coloring book we hope to share with as many people as possible Daphne's joy and fun and help bring stress relief in this hectic world. Once the book is colored it can be used as a story book. Imagine a storybook that you colored yourself! How fun! You can enjoy it again and again.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>Kathleen and I need $500 to print the minimum of 250 coloring books.  They will be 34 pages of fun and adventure to color. We know it's a meager sum, but we are hoping you will help us bring Daphne to print through the donations levels listed. If we go over the $500 we will print as many copies as the monies allow.</li>
<li>
<strong>$15 </strong>USD +shipping : With a $15 donation you will receive a personalized copy of Daphne's Coloring Book. Karen will sign the inside cover with a personal message.  Relieve your stress with hours of coloring fun. Thanks for making this project happen.</li>
<li>
<strong>$20 </strong>USD + shipping : With a $20 donation you will receive your personalized copy of Daphne's coloring book <u>PLUS</u> an exclusive 4 pack of Postcard Prints of Karen's work. You will be able to choose your set of postcards. Thanks for making this project become a reality!</li>
<li>If we don't reach our entire goal the money will be used to cover miscellaneous costs like copyright fees, ISBN Number, and prototype printing costs.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>The publication of Daphne would mean so much to us both. To see an idea from a creative mind and make it a visually enjoyable for young and old is an honor beyond compare. I hope this whimsical house fairy brings a smile to anyone who colors in her book.</li>
<li>Karen has published coloring books before through private funding and they have been well received in their target audience. Creating an Indiegogo  campaign is new to both of us and very exciting.  Karen, being retired, and on limited income Indiegogo seems a great way to continue sharing my artistic and creative books with the world.</li>

<h3><strong>Why Now? </strong></h3>
<p>Over these last 20 years, I have observed several other local LGBT publications from the regional mags (Guide, 99) to Seattle focused (Seattle Gay Standard, Mo' Magazine) and have weighed the pros and cons. Is print media truly dead? Hell No! Is blogging and online social media the only way to go? Yes and no: All it needs is a strategic business model.</p>
<p>I personally have experience in all aspects of journalism going all the way back to 1991 including TV, radio, film, print and blogging. I have been fortunate this past year to learn the publishing business from the master, George Bakan, as a contributor to the Seattle Gay News (SGN). Since the new magazine will be quarterly, I will continue working for the SGN.</p>

<p><strong>Artdigiland books </strong>is an Irish-based publisher dedicated to cinema, theatre, performance and visual arts, in contact with the Italian Cultural Institut in Dublin, too.<br/><br/>We would like to introduce our new editorial project: it is an interview-book (to be released in October 2017) to cinematographer Luciano Tovoli. The volume, entitled <strong><i>On Suspiria and Beyond: A Conversation with Cinematographer Luciano Tovoli</i></strong>, edited by <strong>Piercesare Stagni </strong>and <strong>Valentina Valente</strong>, will be issued worldwide (Italian and English version) during the release of the blue ray of a new restoration of the film <strong><i>Suspiria</i></strong> by Dario Argento, supervised by Tovoli himself and realized by the American company <strong>Synapse Films</strong>.  </p>
<p>Luciano Tovoli (AIC ASC) has worked with very famous directors, such as <strong>Michelangelo Antonioni</strong>, <strong>Marco Ferreri</strong>,<strong> Ettore Scola</strong>,<strong> Luigi Comencini</strong>,<strong> Liliana Cavani</strong>,<strong> Barbet Schroeder</strong>,<strong> Vittorio De Seta</strong>,<strong> Dario Argento</strong> and more. He has been awarded with <strong>two silver ribbon prizes</strong>, in 1976 for <i>The Passenger</i> by Antonioni and in 1989 for <i>Splendor</i> by Scola, plus <strong>a David di Donatello award</strong> for Scola's<i> Captain Fracassa's Journey</i> (1990).</p>
<p>The volume retraces <strong>all the stages of making</strong> <i>Suspiria </i>from test shots to printing. It describes in detail the making of various sequences, relations with the director, explores the cultural premises of this immortal work and the historical context of the struggle for innovation in the cinematography of the Seventies. Above all, it reveals <strong>Luciano Tovoli's passion </strong>and tireless search for an expressive use of <strong>color in films</strong>, providing us with a first-hand experience of an incredible adventure in aesthetics.</p>
</div><div>
<p>We need help to pay for the <strong>translators</strong>, the<strong> graphics</strong>, the<strong> images' copyrights</strong>: in fact, we need support just to cover our outcomes. And your support will make this work become a published and readable book!<br/>We offer for each investor a<strong> pre-sale</strong> of the book at<strong> 25€ instead of 35€</strong> (final cost after the end of this campaign).</p>

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><h2>The history of this book<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 0px;""> </span><br/> </h2><p>Hi, my name is Sabine Wojcieszak. Since 1992 I am working with people on topics like communication, teamwork, soft skills and leadership. A few years ago I stumbled into the tech business by ""accident"" and discovered that the occurring problems in tech teams are nearly the same as in other businesses but the solutions have to differ because of the history and development of tech and the individuals working in it.</p><h3><strong>New methodologies and their effects on the individuals</strong></h3><p>With doing some research on the tech industry I found out that this business struggles with issues like depression, burn out, other mental illnesses and psychosomatic disorders above the average of all industries. This surprised me very much, because most people working in ""tech"" have made their hobby to their profession - which is some kind of living your dream.</p><p>But with diving deeper into the field of software development I found out that the jobs are permanently and rapidly changing - not only according to the tools and programming languages. </p><p> </p><p>All the new hyped agile methods like Scrum, Devops, pair programming and others are changing the process of software development - and new demands on the <strong>soft skills</strong> of each single individual popped up. The changing frameworks needed a new typ of employee as well as a new kind of leader. The ""lonesome fighter"" should now be a teamplayer; the introvert developer should start to communicate openly; the top developer should be a leader and coach; the ""number crunching"" manager should become a servant leader. The goal was and still is to deliver software ""better and faster"". Numerous companies adopted or tried to adopt those approaches by only concentrating on the processes and tools and not on the fundaments of these systems like culture and soft skills. The gap between what teams and people are able to achieve and what is really needed sometimes looks more like the Gran Canyon. The result was that a lot of attempts of going agile, Scrum or Devops failed. In other teams agile approaches are not running in a proper way so that they are not able to work at their optimum because the second, but game changing  goal of making working happier and healthier has been neglected.</p><h3><strong>Communication matters!</strong></h3><p>Communication is the key to teamwork - in a good way as well as in a negative way!</p><p>But communication is more than just talking. It is about listening; it is about perception , respect and tolerance. And a good communication can build trust - really important for successful teamwork! Feedback is a necessary tool for continuous improvement - but it is only possible with a good communication <strong>culture</strong> and accepted <strong>values</strong> ! Leadership and change also demand a well working communication. And at least there is also the topic of meetings - which could be time guzzlers or productive come togethers - where communication is essential. At many points a good communication can save time and money with bringing simultaneously more fun, happiness, motivation and success to the team and the company by causing more engagement instead of only compliance. More engagement and motivation will again save more time and bring more and better ideas to the team. The loop of continuous improvement may start!</p><h3>What´s new about the book?</h3><p>As teams in the tech industry have other main and important tasks than becoming ""communication experts"", I prefer a lightweight way to improve their skills.</p><p><i>You can spend thousands of Euros and months of precious working time in becoming an expert in one special communication tool if you really like it or need it from the professional point of view. But in most cases some smart and slight changes will have unbelievable effects on the team.</i></p><p>I believe it is more important for being successful in an agile environment to have a holistic view on communication so that you can create and develop your own ideas and approaches which will fit to the individuals, to the situation and - to you. Whenever individuals should work together there is no one-size-fits-all-solution. But with a little help everyone is able to evolve the individual communication skills.</p><p>This book will not concentrate on one single communication approach. It will rather focus on real daily work situations I have experienced during my work as a consultant as well as on the results of the survey - an other way of contribution for this project. These real life experiences will be mixed up in the sample company of my book - called ""Lorem Ipsum Ltd."", which is a mid-size software development company with around fifteen employees. I have chosen this company size because they struggle with those issues in a totally different way than all those big players or ""unicorns"". And they have to find other solutions to keep their business alive.</p><p>Examples will include face-to-face communication as well as communication in distributed teams. In this book I will show possible effects of emojis and the exorbitant use of shortcuts and acronyms. It will also deal with communication via Collaboration Software like Issue Trackers, Blogs, Messengers or Slack channels. The book will give an insight on absolutely ""no-gos"" in communication as well as on the difficulties of communication between different stakeholder groups. The reader will see how important it is to listen  and perceive very well to decode the implicit messages. With this book I will emphasise that a good communication is always a question of personal attitude and that it is always depending on both parts - sender as well as receiver!</p><p>There will be examples of feedback as a blame game and what to do to turn it into a game changer. I will highlight the topic of meetings where a lot of companies burn not only money but also motivation and the opportunity for more efficiency.</p><p>To all described dysfunctional situations the book will try to explain what has happened. It will show (a) possible solution(s), the readers can try to adopt or to customise for their individual purposes. </p><p>In addition to this book you can download some open sources team exercises, posters and templates for your team - free for readers as well as none-readers!</p><p>As I am not a native speaker the book will be proofread by an American lady. For getting helpful feedback each chapter of the book will be sent to a bunch of  ""people working tech"" all over the world, which will include different cultural backgrounds and point of views.</p><p>The NerdShirt Challenge is another way of contribution. People from the tech industry can send in a picture of them wearing their favourite NerdShirt. I will publish a selection of those NerdShirts in the book. All pictures will be published on my instagram account.</p><h3>Why do I run this NerdShirt Challenge and the survey?</h3><p>It is a book for the tech community with the contribution of the tech community and their experiences!

Since 1992 I am working with people on topics like communication, teamwork, soft skills and leadership. A few years ago I stumbled into the tech business by ""accident"" and discovered that the occurring problems in tech teams are nearly the same as in other businesses but the solutions have to differ because of the history and development of tech and the individuals working in it.New methodologies and their effects on the individualsWith doing some research on the tech industry I found out that this business struggles with issues like depression, burn out, other mental illnesses and psychosomatic disorders above the average of all industries. This surprised me very much, because most people working in ""tech"" have made their hobby to their profession - which is some kind of living your dream.But with diving deeper into the field of software development I found out that the jobs are permanently and rapidly changing - not only according to the tools and programming languages.  All the new hyped agile methods like Scrum, Devops, pair programming and others are changing the process of software development - and new demands on the soft skills of each single individual popped up. The changing frameworks needed a new typ of employee as well as a new kind of leader. The ""lonesome fighter"" should now be a teamplayer; the introvert developer should start to communicate openly; the top developer should be a leader and coach; the ""number crunching"" manager should become a servant leader. The goal was and still is to deliver software ""better and faster"". Numerous companies adopted or tried to adopt those approaches by only concentrating on the processes and tools and not on the fundaments of these systems like culture and soft skills. The gap between what teams and people are able to achieve and what is really needed sometimes looks more like the Gran Canyon. The result was that a lot of attempts of going agile, Scrum or Devops failed. In other teams agile approaches are not running in a proper way so that they are not able to work at their optimum because the second, but game changing  goal of making working happier and healthier has been neglected.Communication matters!Communication is the key to teamwork - in a good way as well as in a negative way!But communication is more than just talking. It is about listening; it is about perception , respect and tolerance. And a good communication can build trust - really important for successful teamwork! Feedback is a necessary tool for continuous improvement - but it is only possible with a good communication culture and accepted values ! Leadership and change also demand a well working communication. And at least there is also the topic of meetings - which could be time guzzlers or productive come togethers - where communication is essential. At many points a good communication can save time and money with bringing simultaneously more fun, happiness, motivation and success to the team and the company by causing more engagement instead of only compliance. More engagement and motivation will again save more time and bring more and better ideas to the team. The loop of continuous improvement may start!What´s new about the book?As teams in the tech industry have other main and important tasks than becoming ""communication experts"", I prefer a lightweight way to improve their skills.You can spend thousands of Euros and months of precious working time in becoming an expert in one special communication tool if you really like it or need it from the professional point of view. But in most cases some smart and slight changes will have unbelievable effects on the team.I believe it is more important for being successful in an agile environment to have a holistic view on communication so that you can create and develop your own ideas and approaches which will fit to the individuals, to the situation and - to you. Whenever individuals should work together there is no one-size-fits-all-solution. But with a little help everyone is able to evolve the individual communication skills.This book will not concentrate on one single communication approach. It will rather focus on real daily work situations I have experienced during my work as a consultant as well as on the results of the survey - an other way of contribution for this project. These real life experiences will be mixed up in the sample company of my book - called ""Lorem Ipsum Ltd."", which is a mid-size software development company with around fifteen employees. I have chosen this company size because they struggle with those issues in a totally different way than all those big players or ""unicorns"". And they have to find other solutions to keep their business alive.Examples will include face-to-face communication as well as communication in distributed teams. In this book I will show possible effects of emojis and the exorbitant use of shortcuts and acronyms. It will also deal with communication via Collaboration Software like Issue Trackers, Blogs, Messengers or Slack channels. The book will give an insight on absolutely ""no-gos"" in communication as well as on the difficulties of communication between different stakeholder groups. The reader will see how important it is to listen  and perceive very well to decode the implicit messages. With this book I will emphasise that a good communication is always a question of personal attitude and that it is always depending on both parts - sender as well as receiver!There will be examples of feedback as a blame game and what to do to turn it into a game changer. I will highlight the topic of meetings where a lot of companies burn not only money but also motivation and the opportunity for more efficiency.To all described dysfunctional situations the book will try to explain what has happened. It will show (a) possible solution(s), the readers can try to adopt or to customise for their individual purposes. In addition to this book you can download some open sources team exercises, posters and templates for your team - free for readers as well as none-readers!As I am not a native speaker the book will be proofread by an American lady. For getting helpful feedback each chapter of the book will be sent to a bunch of  ""people working tech"" all over the world, which will include different cultural backgrounds and point of views.The NerdShirt Challenge is another way of contribution. People from the tech industry can send in a picture of them wearing their favourite NerdShirt. I will publish a selection of those NerdShirts in the book. All pictures will be published on my instagram account.Why do I run this NerdShirt Challenge and the survey?It is a book for the tech community with the contribution of the tech community and their experiences! This may help readers to identify themselves with special situations and transfer possible solutions to their own teams. The question of moneyGiving money has always to do with trust and with believing in something and / or somebody.My goal is to collect € 8.500 for this project. This money will be spent to give me enough time to run the survey, evaluate it and build in the incoming examples. I want to publish this book latest in March 2018. It will be self-published by Books on Demand as a print version and as an ebook. The book will be a full-colored book with about 250+ pages. The price for the print version will be between € 35 and € 40. To promote this book beforehand I have to speak up at different conferences which is always linked to ""days with no income"" and travel expenses.Due to the fact that I am not a native english speaker I need to pay for a proofreader to find the mistakes, look up for my grammar and polish some of my formulations.After the ""release"" of the book I will have to send out or raffle free examples for further promotion, so that the whole campaign will be a success.As there will be numerous downloads ""for free"". The money is also a contribution to this open source area of the project.Ways of contributionThere are different ways of contribution.1.

<p>Hi! I'm <strong>Gracy Yap</strong>, an Intuitive Master Numerologist, author and teacher with a passion for touching lives. I am reaching out to my friends and supporters for crowdfunding my latest non-fiction book project.The idea for a baby name book was sparked by coffee with friends at a private maternity hospital last year, followed by a baby name numerology reading and an obsession with baby names. So I wrote and released my first baby name ebook ""Destined For Greatness: The Most Popular Baby Boy Names Decoded"" in February this year on the Amazon Kindle Store. It soon became a bestseller on the Top 100 Paid list for Numerology and Baby Names. I have since started work on a baby name guide for girls. This time I decided to put the romance back into books and produce a paperback (which can be an expensive exercise). This is where you come in. You can be a backer to bring my next book to life.</p>
<p><strong>What We Are Hoping To Raise:</strong></p>
<p><strong>- </strong>Our Funding Goal is USD10,000.</p>
<p>- I have already completed my book manuscript and I have print ready printing materials (Artwork).</p>
<p>- I don't foresee any challenges in production as I've already set up my CreateSpace account and passed the Book Review process.</p>
<p>- Once the basic goal of a minimum USD3000 is reached to cover basic printing and design costs for 500 copies, we are good to go! I'm really excited!</p>

So I wrote and released my first baby name ebook ""Destined For Greatness: The Most Popular Baby Boy Names Decoded"" in February this year on the Amazon Kindle Store. It soon became a bestseller on the Top 100 Paid list for Numerology and Baby Names. I have since started work on a baby name guide for girls. This time I decided to put the romance back into books and produce a paperback (which can be an expensive exercise). This is where you come in. You can be a backer to bring my next book to life.
What We Are Hoping To Raise:
- Our Funding Goal is USD10,000.
- I have already completed my book manuscript and I have print ready printing materials (Artwork).
- I don't foresee any challenges in production as I've already set up my CreateSpace account and passed the Book Review process.
- Once the basic goal of a minimum USD3000 is reached to cover basic printing and design costs for 500 copies, we are good to go! I'm really excited!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>How I became The NECKspert </strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Firstly, I should point out that I'm a physiotherapist and have dedicated my career to neck pain. But let's rewind a few years and I'll explain how I got here.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My first ever memory of neck pain was when I was about 5 years old. One night, I slept in front of a fan and the next morning I got out of bed, took my shirt off and my neck locked up. I couldn't move it for 3 days, it was incredibly painful, I missed the school athletics carnival (there were only 81 kids in my whole school, just 10 in my year, so I liked my chances at winning) and decided then and there that neck pain sucks.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As a teenager I was completely obsessed with surfing (and still am to this day), and given the demands of paddling for hours on the neck, I was no stranger to neck pain during my high-school years.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>But my experience with truly crippling, life-impacting neck pain didn’t arrive until I was at university.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It seemed as though university was the perfect storm for my neck - hours and hours of sitting in lectures and studying with bad posture; lifting heavy weights in the gym to impress my new female classmates; incredibly high levels of stress and poor sleeping habits. By my second year at university I had developed chronic neck-pain, postural headaches, migraines and neck-related dizziness, which for a physiotherapy student seemed like a cruel irony.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I began seeking answers and treatment from my university lecturers, who were some of the brightest minds in neck research, but despite seeing over 10 different health professionals (physio’s, chiro’s, doctors, neurologists), not one of them was able to fix my neck.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>After several months of failing to improve and thousands of dollars later (which for a self-funded university student felt like millions), I began to feel depressed. I started having anxiety attacks. My mental health was starting to reflect my physical health.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Rock-bottom came one day when one of my neck-related headaches progressed into a migraine with flashing lights, dizziness, crippling pain and I ended up in the office of a neurologist having CT scans on my neck and brain to see if I had a tumour. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>After an hour of sitting in his waiting room, nervously awaiting results, he came out to collect his next patient. As he was walking away I called out, “Any results yet doc?”. He looked back at me, searched his brain for who I was (despite seeing me just one hour earlier), and then replied nonchalantly, “Oh, results were all fine, you can leave”. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I couldn’t believe that this was how a “specialist” treated his patients. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Is there anything you can do for me?” I asked. “I could give you a script for pain and migraine tablets if you want, but I don’t think you need them...”. He turned and walked away.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I have come to find that more often than not, our lowest points in life can light a fire inside us that provides a catalyst for change. They inspire massive action and set us on a new path. This was one of those days for me. At that moment I became determined to fix myself and also to focus my physio career on helping others who had struggled with neck-related pain and dysfunction.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Over the following months I began to implement the steps that you will come to learn about in the NECKcellent method. These steps were a trial-and-error blend of things I had learnt at university, strategies and concepts I had read about outside of the university walls, ideas and techniques I learnt through yoga and a dash of intuition.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It didn’t take long before the strategies I was implementing began to work. Within 2 weeks I felt better. Within 3 months my neck pain was gone. I still haven’t had a migraine in over 10 years.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>With a new lease on life I forged ahead with my physiotherapy degree and upon graduating was awarded The University Medal (High Distinction average), The Dean’s Scholar Award (first place in the cohort) and went on to do an Honours Thesis where I wrote an academic paper on neck pain which was published in a medical journal. I tell you this not to boast or brag, but to reinforce my passion, hard work and drive in my field.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Over the past 10 years I have been honing and refining my treatment methods for fixing neck pain and creating healthy and strong necks. I have stayed true to my dedicated pursuit of helping as many people as possible live a life without neck pain. My physiotherapy clinics help thousands of people with neck pain every year, my corporate health company has taught thousands of people how to have a healthy neck at work, and I continue to work with schools to implement postural strength programs for their students.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Writing NECK PAIN SUCKS was the next logical step in achieving my mission as the NECKspert: To help 100,000 people achieve NECKcellence: a strong, pain-free and healthy neck forever.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Book</h3>
<p>I have structured the book very deliberately to ensure that you get better, and stay better:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Section 1 will give you a basic overview of the neck in terms of anatomy, all of its amazing functions and how all of the systems in the body are connected (especially to the neck).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We will also explore the concept of pain science and why there is much more to the complex experience of pain than meets the eye. I will also give you a framework for how to best approach the 5-steps to NECKcellence that will be explored in section 2, through the science of behaviour change and habit formation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Section 2 will unveil the 5 practical aspects of achieving a pain-free, strong and healthy neck forever.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Section 3 explores life beyond pain, maintaining NECKcellence and ensuring your new healthy neck remains that way forever. In section 3, you will also learn the one true secret of how to heal your neck forever.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The reality is that everything in the body is connected. All systems. This means that everything within the body influences the health of our neck; alignment of the hips or feet, health of the gut, eye function, even our heart and lungs. The same is true in reverse; the health of the neck can and does influence every other system in our body! I’ll explain this in more detail in the book, but for now just take my word for it - the body is amazing!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>With that in mind, it is worth noting that whilst this book is focused on the neck, the interconnectedness of everything in the body also means that many of the concepts and principles in this book can also be applied to other areas of pain in the body (e.g. lower back pain, knee pain, hip pain, shoulder pain and chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, gut and digestion disorders, and even mental health conditions such as depression and anxiety).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Let’s get started - I’m very excited about helping you achieve NECKcellence.</p>

How can the city get cycling right in the 21st century—and help to secure a sustainable future?These are the questions we ask, and answer, in Cycling Cities: The Johannesburg Experience. Back our book project with the last bit of funding we need and help us bring this important story to a larger audience. Cycling Cities: The Johannesburg Experience challenges the inevitability of today’s Johannesburg, a city  synonymous with highways and rush hours, cars, minibus taxis, and 4x4s. The book shows that Johannesburg wasn’t always like this: it once was a cycling city. Author Njogu Morgan brings to life that once-thriving cycling city. His ground-breaking research and historical photos detail the sustainable profile of Johannesburg’s past. Well into the 20th century, everyone from mineworkers to the city’s elites found cycling a viable way of getting around. Cycling Cities: The Johannesburg Experience documents the forward-looking bike lane built in the 1930s, the tens of thousands of bicycle licences sold well into the 1950s, and the role that people of colour played in the city’s cycling history before Apartheid put a stop to it. Morgan shows how taking cycling seriously can help it to reinstate it as a mainstay of daily life.  So far, we have raised most of the funds we need, covering the costs of the author's research, as well as editing and image rights to a total of 40,000 Euro. Our printing costs have been covered by a single generous donation. Now we need to raise the funds still needed to pay for the book’s design, typesetting, and distribution. By donating to this project, you can help to bring awareness to a broader audience of cyclists and urbanists, as well as everyone interested in how to make their car-dependent communities more sustainable and rewarding places to live.The BookThe book is a full-colour, beautifully bound A5 hardcover of approximately 80 pages. It will resemble the mockup image found here. More information on other books in the series is available at cyclingcities.info.Risks and Challenges: Raising the funds to publish a physical bookBecause we have raised funds for actual printing of the book, and because the manuscript is complete and image rights have already been purchased, we are confident that we can bring this book to print, if needs be, with varying amounts of money. For that reason, this is not an all-or-nothing fundraising campaign, but one in which we keep all the funds raised, at whatever total amount. We will use these funds to pay for the book's design, typesetting, etc, as described below. If we fall far short of our target, some aspects of the book's production may have to be revised. If these changes push the book's publication date far beyond what we have promised you, our backers, we will communicate this with you timeously and provide alternatives where we can.Producing a book in an untested environmentTo date, the Cycling Cities authors have produced 5 books. This  is the first volume to be produced in a city outside Europe, however. That means printing and distributing the book in a new way. We’ve sourced an experienced South African printing company that produces high-quality books. To ensure a hassle-free post-production process, we plan to pack and send the books personally and distribute them separately from Amsterdam (Europe, the USA, and other countries) and Johannesburg (South Africa). When and where will the book be published and distributed?The manuscript is in final editing stages and printing funding and image rights have already been secured.

<p><strong>Darkness Within</strong></p>
<p>Welcome!  I'm Marz, AKA The Baroness.  I am a writer, artist, costume designer and character concept creator.  I have been writing short stories since I was a child.  3 years ago I began designing and creating my own characters and costumes.  The costumes can have elaborate headdresses, leather work, body jewellery.  I use a lot of foraged bones and other natural products (I make cool stuff out of dead stuff).</p>
<p>Last year my creations were noticed by a number of photographers, and used in multitudes of really awesome shoots.  All these shoots were other people's vision of my creations, and this year I wanted to highlight my vision.</p>
<p>All my characters are strong women; some are crazy, psychotic, merciless, others are compassionate, honourable.  All of them are a little (or a lot) damaged, but they rise above it.  This idea that we can make peace with the darkness within us and still be strong and capable is incredibly important to me.  One of the reasons I love to work with photographers, models, make up artists is that I want to really showcase that while bad things happen, it doesn't have to break us forever.</p>
<p>So this year I am writing a dark fantasy anthology.  There will be 10 strong women characters, their stories and images to reflect both the story and my art.</p>
<p>The money that I raise during this campaign will be to pay for the photographers, models and make up artists.  I am fortunate enough to know some very talented people and am excited to introduce you to them.</p>
<p>Even if I don't reach my goal, every penny will go to the books images.  Part of this will also be self funded.  It may take longer than I originally estimate if I don't reach my goal, but it will still get completed.  </p>
<p>I have some awesome perks for contributors, including the first story and images - which is complete and waiting for you.  I will be updating regularly, and giving you glimpses behind the scenes, introducing you to some of the fantastic people I will be working with.</p>
<p>If you are unable to contribute financially please share my campaign far and wide and encourage others to contribute.  </p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Hi, I'm Dorsey, Gustavo's Mom</h3>
<p>My name is Dorsey Barger and I own and operate HausBar Farm in East Austin. Before I became an urban farmer in 2009, I was in the restaurant business.  I opened my own restaurant, The Eastside Cafe, in Austin, Texas in 1988 when I was 24 years old. (24 years later, I sold it to my business partner so that I could be a full time farmer.) I had hung out in restaurants throughout my childhood because I grew up with a mom who thought that vegetables came frozen in bags with sauce already on them.  She just dropped the entire bag into boiling water. I’m absolutely positive this is why I became a restaurateur and then an urban farmer, who grows tons of vegetables. </p>
<p>HausBar Farm isn't only about our garden and the amazing things we raise for Austin's restaurants, it's also about the wonderful farm animals who bring us so much joy. Gustavo, the most famous of them all, came into our lives 7 years ago when I thought it might be fun to raise a few geese and some ducks.  He arrived in a box from the hatchery.  I had to drive to the post office to pick him up. He was just 2 days old.  When I got him back to the farm, he jumped out of the box and took over the whole farm with his enormous personality, his huge heart, and his gift for making people feel loved. Geese have a well-deserved reputation for being aggressive towards people. But Gustavo loves <i>to <strong>kiss</strong></i> people and even lead them on tours of the farm, sticking out his big, proud chest as he walks. He's a veritable goose goodwill ambassador.</p>
<p>Gustavo brings so much joy to so many, that we wanted to share his story in a book. I wrote about his adventures in his voice. His grandmother, my mother, Barbara Adams, (the very same boiler of bags of veggies) spent three years painting beautiful portraits of Gustavo and his family and friends to illustrate the book. Gustavo supervised the whole project, making sure we both got his story exactly right. The children's book, <strong>'On Gustavo's Farm'</strong> is now ready to go to print.  You can help us share his story with the world by supporting our Indiegogo campaign. </p>

I have been involved in the literary / book arts for my entire life – from obsessively reading classic literature as a child to majoring in creative writing at The University of Tampa; editing literary magazines to forming local poetry groups; combining poetry and photography and creating handmade books.</p><p>I worked for Barnes &amp; Noble for eighteen years (in the Jensen Beach store for the past eight). Before that, I was a retail store manager for eight years. A couple of things I constantly heard from customers at B&amp;N was how meagre the poetry section was and “Where is the local authors section?” We tried to build a larger poetry department, but found the problems of obtaining books from small and micro publishers – where the majority of poetry is published – a difficult to impossible hurdle in the corporate structure. Many of the poets I would look for were simply unavailable through our supply chain. This left the customers with a selection of ""big name"" and corporate choices. The same issues popped up again and again for local authors – especially those just starting out on their literary adventure. Independent magazines were virtually invisible.</p><p>Literature, and poetry in particular, is an art appreciated through exploration. Recommendations by booksellers, artists, and well-read friends help direct those explorations. Each work, hopefully, leads to new discoveries.</p><p>Port Saint Lucie has a couple of used bookstores, but where does that stock come from? It’s the castaways from the big chains – so still no variety. Our closest independent bookstore on the Treasure Coast is the Vero Beach Book Center about 35 miles away, and they are a general interest store – albeit a wonderful one. PSL is the eighth largest city in Florida, with a population greater than Fort Lauderdale and quickly catching Tallahassee, and yet we don’t have an independent bookstore, a community place to celebrate our creative souls.</p><p>The idea of Poetic Justice Books and Arts is to create that place of discovery. To provide a place to support and share creativity. We will host regular readings, signings, and events with a focus on local poets, authors, and artists. Our stock will be a finely curated mix of poetry, literary fiction and non-fiction, bringing in the titles that are not featured in national chain stores or are buried under the weight of a national bestseller list that has little-to-no relationship with Florida’s Treasure Coast. And we will have a gallery featuring local artists.</p><p>We will offer a great rewards program: every dollar you spend gets a point; 100 points gets you a $5 credit. 10% discount for students / military / seniors. 15% educator discount.</p><p>Throughout the early planning stages, I have received an immense amount of support and encouragement. People are obviously interested in what we are doing. We plan to bring the community space that we (and you) desire. We aim to represent you, Port Saint Lucie, to the best of our ability.</p><p> </p><p><strong>What We’ve Done So Far</strong></p><p>Poetic Justice Books and Arts, LLC is registered with federal, state, county and city agencies. A POS, inventory and computer system has been invested in and a website is in the process of being created. The domain name PoeticJusticeBooks.com is secured. Accounts have been established with a variety of vendors. Locations have been scouted. Local artists have expressed interest in consigning work for a gallery wall.</p><p> </p><p><strong>What’s Needed Now</strong></p><p>The two big hurdles facing us right now are rent and inventory (though we have made a small dent in the inventory). So, the goal of this campaign is to secure funding for a physical presence in Port Saint Lucie. Rental space along the busy US1 corridor is running about $15 – $20 per square foot for a 1000 square foot storefront, so we’re looking at $15,000 - $20,000.

I have been involved in the literary / book arts for my entire life – from obsessively reading classic literature as a child to majoring in creative writing at The University of Tampa; editing literary magazines to forming local poetry groups; combining poetry and photography and creating handmade books.I worked for Barnes & Noble for eighteen years (in the Jensen Beach store for the past eight). Before that, I was a retail store manager for eight years. A couple of things I constantly heard from customers at B&N was how meagre the poetry section was and “Where is the local authors section?” We tried to build a larger poetry department, but found the problems of obtaining books from small and micro publishers – where the majority of poetry is published – a difficult to impossible hurdle in the corporate structure. Many of the poets I would look for were simply unavailable through our supply chain. This left the customers with a selection of ""big name"" and corporate choices. The same issues popped up again and again for local authors – especially those just starting out on their literary adventure. Independent magazines were virtually invisible.Literature, and poetry in particular, is an art appreciated through exploration. Recommendations by booksellers, artists, and well-read friends help direct those explorations. Each work, hopefully, leads to new discoveries.Port Saint Lucie has a couple of used bookstores, but where does that stock come from? It’s the castaways from the big chains – so still no variety. Our closest independent bookstore on the Treasure Coast is the Vero Beach Book Center about 35 miles away, and they are a general interest store – albeit a wonderful one. PSL is the eighth largest city in Florida, with a population greater than Fort Lauderdale and quickly catching Tallahassee, and yet we don’t have an independent bookstore, a community place to celebrate our creative souls.The idea of Poetic Justice Books and Arts is to create that place of discovery. To provide a place to support and share creativity. We will host regular readings, signings, and events with a focus on local poets, authors, and artists. Our stock will be a finely curated mix of poetry, literary fiction and non-fiction, bringing in the titles that are not featured in national chain stores or are buried under the weight of a national bestseller list that has little-to-no relationship with Florida’s Treasure Coast. And we will have a gallery featuring local artists.We will offer a great rewards program: every dollar you spend gets a point; 100 points gets you a $5 credit. 10% discount for students / military / seniors. 15% educator discount.Throughout the early planning stages, I have received an immense amount of support and encouragement. People are obviously interested in what we are doing. We plan to bring the community space that we (and you) desire. We aim to represent you, Port Saint Lucie, to the best of our ability. What We’ve Done So FarPoetic Justice Books and Arts, LLC is registered with federal, state, county and city agencies. A POS, inventory and computer system has been invested in and a website is in the process of being created. The domain name PoeticJusticeBooks.com is secured. Accounts have been established with a variety of vendors. Locations have been scouted. Local artists have expressed interest in consigning work for a gallery wall. What’s Needed NowThe two big hurdles facing us right now are rent and inventory (though we have made a small dent in the inventory). So, the goal of this campaign is to secure funding for a physical presence in Port Saint Lucie. Rental space along the busy US1 corridor is running about $15 – $20 per square foot for a 1000 square foot storefront, so we’re looking at $15,000 - $20,000. For initial inventory, we are hoping to fill approximately 2500 linear feet of display shelves, so that should be in the neighborhood of $15,000. That gives us a goal of $35,000 to get a secure location, utilities, and stock. Risks and ChallengesThe first thing everyone asks when we tell them we’re opening a bookstore is “What about Amazon?” Well, your typical Amazon customer is not your typical bookstore customer.

<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
</div>
<h3>What about our first issue?</h3>
<p><strong>estranged #1. <i>Photo album of Icelandic drag family</i></strong> is like having a kiki with Icelandic drag performers. From their life experiences at the intersection of various prejudices based on sex, gender, sexuality, age, ethnicity, class, handicap or beliefs, <strong>estranged</strong> analyses how the art of drag is a mean of escape and a form of resistance. </p>
<p>Gathering conversations with many astonishing drag artists like the internationally-famous musician and Icelandic icon, <strong>Páll Óskar</strong>, or the current reigning drag queen of Iceland, <strong>Gógó Starr</strong>, cabaret performer <strong>Miss Mokki</strong>, drag queens: <strong>Jackie Moon</strong>, <strong>Jenny Purr</strong>, <strong>Deff Starr</strong>, <strong>Atli Freyr Demantur</strong>, <strong>Wonda Starr</strong>, musician <strong>Skaði Þórðardóttir</strong>, drag kings <strong>Yan Nuss</strong>, <strong>BoyToy Tony</strong>, and many others, this zine addresses their uncommon life experiences.</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Impact of the campaign and estranged #1</h3>
<p>By documenting and gathering the personal experiences of the members of Icelandic drag family, we highlight their condition in society and their resistance to the discriminations in social practices and in legislation (for example - the stigmatisation of non-binary people by the use of term ""gender identity disorder"" in 2012 Icelandic law). Therefore, we create a community of experience and we offer a visibility of issues that we should face together, rather than isolated.</p>
<p>This is why <strong>estranged #1. <i>Photo album of Icelandic drag family</i></strong> is a <u>unique project</u>. It is not only a gathering of interviews but also articles addressing directly how we can improve society. To make this ambition possible, we are willing to collaborate with local associations, especially <a href=""http://trans.samtokin78.is/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Trans Ísland</a>, to raise awareness, and have a solid contribution to human equality - with a special consideration for non-human animal rights.</p>
<p>And of course, <strong>estranged </strong>is an artistic experience. In our first issue, we celebrate the fantastic visual dimension of the art of drag, and every photography aims to see what's happening beneath the surface of drag makeup.</p>

<h3><strong>So, what do we have for you?</strong></h3>
<p>Of, course, the zine.</p>
<p>If we reach our goal, <strong>estranged #1. <i>Photo album of Icelandic drag family</i></strong> will be ready in <u>September</u>! During the summer, we'll finish collecting the last interviews of the members of community - those who are on the stage, but also the ones behind the curtains.</p>
<p>Our first issue (in English) is designed for a paper format (225 × 297mm). You can enjoy full <strong>estranged #1 </strong>reading<strong> </strong>experience with our <strong>printed version</strong>. But a digital version is also available.</p>

<p>For every one of you, dear contributors, you will receive a <strong>personal postcard</strong> from portrait photography project ""F*CK GENDER"" by Kaspars Bekeris, signed by himself and Strell Ytzia, and a shoutout on social media (<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/estrangedmag/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Facebook</a> and/or <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/estrangedmag/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Instagram</a>) on our <strong>estranged</strong> accounts.</p>
<p>With our ""F*CK GENDER"" tote bag (organic and handmade), you will be able to bring everywhere the rebellious spirit of <strong>estranged</strong>! With this reward we wanted to stress out that the art of drag manipulates the attributes called ""feminine"" or ""masculine"" in a given culture. Drag is a way of expression and/or entertainment, it considers genders as a social and cultural material. Therefore, it is probably better - to stop defining our identities according to genders. So… F*CK GENDER.</p>
<p>We also have some <strong>exceptional rewards</strong> including a <strong>Signed Art Photography Print</strong> of your choice from a very special selection of Kaspars Bekeris for <strong>estranged #1 </strong>(see the perk ""<u>Matron Of Art</u>""). We will contact you right after your amazing contribution, to choose which Photography you would prefer. You can already check some of his <a href=""https://estrangedmag.com/photos/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">portrait photography</a> for <strong>estranged #1. <i>Photo album of Icelandic drag family.</i></strong><br/><br/>Kaspars and Strell Ytzia are also offering you a <strong>privileged moment for a personalized drag </strong><strong>makeover</strong><strong> and a photoshoot</strong>! (see the perk ""<u>Drag Goddess</u>"" - Reykjavik, Paris, Riga only.) Right after your incredible contribution, we will discuss when and where, and what are your desires for this drag transformation (makeup, wig, outfit...). Kaspars will be here to capture this moment!</p>

<p><strong>Thursday, 07th of June 2018</strong> - 21:00-23h30<br/>At <strong>Gaukurinn</strong> (Tryggvagata 22, Reykjavik)</p>
<p>« STRELL YTZIA BLOSSOM: A Utopian Drag Show » is the culmination of the fundraising campaign. On the 7th of June, 2018 you are heartily invited to this story of wonder and liberation. Before moving away from Iceland, she wanted to transport you to her secret garden, a fairy place where she sings live, lip-syncs, dances and does poetry to express and flourish herself. And as you could expect, your intersectional diva will perform for good causes.</p>
<p>As an emergency against oppressive ideologies, it is time for her to bloom before your astonished eyes. Your bird of paradise will beautifully challenge sexist and gendered nonsense, racialist absurdities and capitalist foolishness. A spectacle of how peaceful fantasies shatter those pipe dreams. With the wonderful <strong>Queen Jackie Moon</strong> and <strong>Hans</strong>, Strell Ytzia will create a utopia.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We are willing to work on the project, even if we don't achieve the goal, but that could mean that the first issue of <strong>estranged</strong> and the perks could be ready later than September. Because of the fact that it would not allow us to work full-time on <strong><i>estranged #1 Photo album of Icelandic drag family</i></strong>. It could involve an additional work on advertising and searching for sponsorship. But our commitment and values will remain the same.</p>

<h3>Our story</h3>
<p>Our first issue began more than a year ago with the photo series:<strong> ""<i>The Secret Life of a Drag queen""</i></strong> (by photographer Kaspars Bekeris). The photo project has an exhibition at Gaukurinn, the principal venue of the drag life here in Reykjavik, and KKC, Riga, Latvia during the film festival ""2 ANNAS. Outsiders"". What emerged in front of the camera was the incredible diversity of life stories in this young yet talented local community of Icelandic drag.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Words from Kaspars (Co-founding editor):</strong></p>
<p>« <i>For more than 15 years, I have been guilty of “polluting the ether” professionally by covering the news as a TV reporter, writer, and photographer for different media. I have always been interested in ideas and life experiences of other people which can highlight both imperfections of the world and the ways to change it. Unfortunately, I was never fully satisfied with the limitations of modern media.</i></p>
<p><i>The last year and a half </i><i>has</i><i> been a period of transformation for me – I had the opportunity to reconnect with an artistic side within and dedicate myself to one of my biggest passions – photography, by making documentary portrait photography project of drag artists in Iceland “<strong>F*ck Gender”</strong>. After meeting Matthias aka. Strell Ytzia, we decided to reach out to all conscious rebels and make the first issue of </i><i>estranged</i><i> magazine on Icelandic drag family (hopefully, our own family now). Estranged is our attempt to create a media that offers a place for mindful conversations on art and politics to inspire everyone to develop new ideas and take action.</i> »</p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: right;""><strong>Words from Matthias (Co-founding editor): </strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: right;"">« <i>You can call me Strell, Strell Ytzia, your bird of Paradise.</i></p>
<p style=""text-align: right;""><i>I began to be engaged and focused on the common Good where I was born and grew up, </i><i>in</i><i> Reunion Island, France. There, I initiated the founding of the local movement of the Young Greens (Les Jeunes Ecologistes), before spending two years in Paris for my studies in social sciences and philosophy at Sciences Po Paris and La Sorbonne Paris IV. </i></p>
<p style=""text-align: right;""><i>Now, I live in Reykjavik where I met Kaspars and began to be a drag artist - a new chapter of my life. Nevertheless, I remain faithful to my values. Stating through the art of drag, so against the binarism of gender, my non-white non-heterosexual and vegan identity, and creating Estranged are my new contributions to the intersectional movement for justice. </i>»</p>

What is estranged? 
estranged, the intersectional zine on countercultures, by Kaspars Bekeris, the dedicated journalist and photographer, and Matthias “Strell Ytzia’’ Boyer, environmental activist and drag artist.
For each issue, we empathically gather personal experiences, as a source of inspiration for all of us, who have ever felt estranged. Intended to be a platform providing visibility to the figure of the “other’’, estranged highlights their existence and their resistance. 
By dint of an intersectional approach cultivating awareness on contemporary issues, we aim to improve and sustain human harmony. estranged is a contribution for a radical liberation.With our campaign focusing on estranged #1. Photo album of Icelandic drag family, we invite you to make a new step together in the history of anti-discrimination movements, especially LGBTQIA+ and anti-racism movements, Women and Non-human Animal Liberation.
""The convergence of struggles is real.""
 


Introduction to our first issue: We had a kiki with Icelandic drag artists
 

What about our first issue?
estranged #1. Photo album of Icelandic drag family is like having a kiki with Icelandic drag performers. From their life experiences at the intersection of various prejudices based on sex, gender, sexuality, age, ethnicity, class, handicap or beliefs, estranged analyses how the art of drag is a mean of escape and a form of resistance. 
Gathering conversations with many astonishing drag artists like the internationally-famous musician and Icelandic icon, Páll Óskar, or the current reigning drag queen of Iceland, Gógó Starr, cabaret performer Miss Mokki, drag queens: Jackie Moon, Jenny Purr, Deff Starr, Atli Freyr Demantur, Wonda Starr, musician Skaði Þórðardóttir, drag kings Yan Nuss, BoyToy Tony, and many others, this zine addresses their uncommon life experiences.
""Hence, drag is not (only) about ego, but about being equal.""
 

 
The Impact of the campaign and estranged #1
By documenting and gathering the personal experiences of the members of Icelandic drag family, we highlight their condition in society and their resistance to the discriminations in social practices and in legislation (for example - the stigmatisation of non-binary people by the use of term ""gender identity disorder"" in 2012 Icelandic law). Therefore, we create a community of experience and we offer a visibility of issues that we should face together, rather than isolated.
This is why estranged #1. Photo album of Icelandic drag family is a unique project. It is not only a gathering of interviews but also articles addressing directly how we can improve society. To make this ambition possible, we are willing to collaborate with local associations, especially Trans Ísland, to raise awareness, and have a solid contribution to human equality - with a special consideration for non-human animal rights.
And of course, estranged is an artistic experience. In our first issue, we celebrate the fantastic visual dimension of the art of drag, and every photography aims to see what's happening beneath the surface of drag makeup.

estranged is an independent slow-media, an artistic and ethical zine. It does involve that our work and its quality stand out from our mainstream counterparts, on the price, just slightly, but primarily on the form and content.All of the content that we produced for more than a year until now has been made from our limited resources. Now, your help is crucial to make the first documentation on Icelandic drag happen, and to support the local community!
Each donation makes a difference!

 
So, what do we have for you?
Of, course, the zine.
If we reach our goal, estranged #1. Photo album of Icelandic drag family will be ready in September! During the summer, we'll finish collecting the last interviews of the members of community - those who are on the stage, but also the ones behind the curtains.
Our first issue (in English) is designed for a paper format (225 × 297mm). You can enjoy full estranged #1 reading experience with our printed version. But a digital version is also available.
 

 
For every one of you, dear contributors, you will receive a personal postcard from portrait photography project ""F*CK GENDER"" by Kaspars Bekeris, signed by himself and Strell Ytzia, and a shoutout on social media (Facebook and/or Instagram) on our estranged accounts.
With our ""F*CK GENDER"" tote bag (organic and handmade), you will be able to bring everywhere the rebellious spirit of estranged! With this reward we wanted to stress out that the art of drag manipulates the attributes called ""feminine"" or ""masculine"" in a given culture. Drag is a way of expression and/or entertainment, it considers genders as a social and cultural material. Therefore, it is probably better - to stop defining our identities according to genders. So… F*CK GENDER.
We also have some exceptional rewards including a Signed Art Photography Print of your choice from a very special selection of Kaspars Bekeris for estranged #1 (see the perk ""Matron Of Art""). We will contact you right after your amazing contribution, to choose which Photography you would prefer. You can already check some of his portrait photography for estranged #1. Photo album of Icelandic drag family.Kaspars and Strell Ytzia are also offering you a privileged moment for a personalized drag makeover and a photoshoot! (see the perk ""Drag Goddess"" - Reykjavik, Paris, Riga only.) Right after your incredible contribution, we will discuss when and where, and what are your desires for this drag transformation (makeup, wig, outfit...). Kaspars will be here to capture this moment!
 


About the ""Strell Ytzia Blossom. A Utopian Drag Show"":
Thursday, 07th of June 2018 - 21:00-23h30At Gaukurinn (Tryggvagata 22, Reykjavik)
« STRELL YTZIA BLOSSOM: A Utopian Drag Show » is the culmination of the fundraising campaign. On the 7th of June, 2018 you are heartily invited to this story of wonder and liberation. Before moving away from Iceland, she wanted to transport you to her secret garden, a fairy place where she sings live, lip-syncs, dances and does poetry to express and flourish herself. And as you could expect, your intersectional diva will perform for good causes.
As an emergency against oppressive ideologies, it is time for her to bloom before your astonished eyes. Your bird of paradise will beautifully challenge sexist and gendered nonsense, racialist absurdities and capitalist foolishness. A spectacle of how peaceful fantasies shatter those pipe dreams. With the wonderful Queen Jackie Moon and Hans, Strell Ytzia will create a utopia.
""From glitters to the Cosmos.""
 

 
Why an ""intersectional approach""? 
""Because we all have a body and an identity, but we do not fairly experience them if we are “woman’’/“man’’ identified people, intersex, trans, in transition, cis, or non-binary. 
We all have desires, but we do not fairly experience them if we are Lesbian, Gay, Straight, Pansexual; If our desires are sexual or romantic. 
We all have a need for human relationships, but we do not fairly experience it when we are racialized, pathologized, or essentialized. 
And furthermore, we are all earthlings. But we do not fairly experience our life when we are human, or non-human.""
 



 

 

Risks & Challenges
We are willing to work on the project, even if we don't achieve the goal, but that could mean that the first issue of estranged and the perks could be ready later than September. Because of the fact that it would not allow us to work full-time on estranged #1 Photo album of Icelandic drag family. It could involve an additional work on advertising and searching for sponsorship. But our commitment and values will remain the same.
 

 
Our story
Our first issue began more than a year ago with the photo series: ""The Secret Life of a Drag queen"" (by photographer Kaspars Bekeris). The photo project has an exhibition at Gaukurinn, the principal venue of the drag life here in Reykjavik, and KKC, Riga, Latvia during the film festival ""2 ANNAS. Outsiders"". What emerged in front of the camera was the incredible diversity of life stories in this young yet talented local community of Icelandic drag.
 
Words from Kaspars (Co-founding editor):
« For more than 15 years, I have been guilty of “polluting the ether” professionally by covering the news as a TV reporter, writer, and photographer for different media. I have always been interested in ideas and life experiences of other people which can highlight both imperfections of the world and the ways to change it. Unfortunately, I was never fully satisfied with the limitations of modern media.
The last year and a half has been a period of transformation for me – I had the opportunity to reconnect with an artistic side within and dedicate myself to one of my biggest passions – photography, by making documentary portrait photography project of drag artists in Iceland “F*ck Gender”. After meeting Matthias aka. Strell Ytzia, we decided to reach out to all conscious rebels and make the first issue of estranged magazine on Icelandic drag family (hopefully, our own family now). Estranged is our attempt to create a media that offers a place for mindful conversations on art and politics to inspire everyone to develop new ideas and take action. »
 
Words from Matthias (Co-founding editor): 
« You can call me Strell, Strell Ytzia, your bird of Paradise.
I began to be engaged and focused on the common Good where I was born and grew up, in Reunion Island, France. There, I initiated the founding of the local movement of the Young Greens (Les Jeunes Ecologistes), before spending two years in Paris for my studies in social sciences and philosophy at Sciences Po Paris and La Sorbonne Paris IV. 
Now, I live in Reykjavik where I met Kaspars and began to be a drag artist - a new chapter of my life. Nevertheless, I remain faithful to my values. Stating through the art of drag, so against the binarism of gender, my non-white non-heterosexual and vegan identity, and creating Estranged are my new contributions to the intersectional movement for justice. »

<h3>Who am I, and what is <i>Dellie's Run</i>?</h3>
<p>I'm Laura Lee Cascada, a writer and animal advocate based in Portsmouth, Virginia. I have a master’s degree in environmental policy from Johns Hopkins and am the Director of Corporate Outreach for Compassion Over Killing (where I make vegan options like Starbucks’ macadamia oat cookie appear on menus nationwide). I also run <a href=""http://www.everyanimalproject.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Every Animal Project</a>, a collection of photographs and awe-inspiring stories of animals around the globe. I spend my free time advocating for imperiled wild hermit crabs through my <a href=""http://plightofthehermies.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Plight of the Hermies</a> campaign and managing marketing and PR for the annual Hampton Roads VegFest.</p>
<p>For my entire life, I have been moved and shaped by the power of words, and I believe that they truly can change lives and open hearts and minds. Four years ago, I began a journey to use my own words to share the truth about the oppressive animal agriculture system, which abuses and kills billions every year, through the eyes of a loveable, inquisitive, and headstrong character named Delaware.</p>
<p>The novel is already complete. And as a former editor, I've already given it an initial run-through. But I need your help to get it professionally edited and formatted and then to get it out of the depths of my computer's hard drive and into the world.</p>
<h2><strong>Book Synopsis</strong></h2>
<p>When you’ve lived your entire life mired in muck and filth, dreams might be the only thing you can cling to. And inside her prison, lost in a sea of thousands of other girls, Delaware has one colossal dream that revolves around a simple white ball. Captivating her from the screen of the portable television owned by one of the prison workers, it is her only glimpse of the place she calls Outside. Her dream is baseball.</p>
<p><i>Dellie’s Run</i> is an empowering story of one girl chasing the elusive home run in the name of freedom—not just for her, but for the thousands she left behind. Along the way, she comes face to face with who she really is and why, according to the laws of physics, she’s basically destined to strike out. As Dellie sets off to defy these odds along with the companionship and scientific ingenuity of a curious young boy named Austin, she might just change the game for her kind—and for all of us on the Outside.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I have decided to self-publish <i>Dellie's Run</i> because I believe it's the best way to stay true to my creative vision for this book. But to turn this project into a reality, I will need to raise at least $5,000. I will need help with copy editing, internal design, and (the biggie) marketing. I want to raise enough to launch my book into the world at full steam via press releases, book-signing events, interviews, ads, advance reviews, an online presence, and much more.</p>
<p>In return, I'm inviting you to join Dellie on her journey! See the different perks to the right to find out what you'll get in return!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><i>Dellie's Run</i> will reach thousands of Americans who will love a good adventure about our nation's greatest pastime, baseball--and through Dellie's story, they will find a spark of compassion inside themselves they never knew they had.</p>
<p>Words can deeply touch our souls and cause us to reflect on our very foundations. This book will prompt many readers to think about the choices they make in their daily lives, and to begin choosing compassion three times each day.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>If I don't reach my goal, <i>Dellie's Run</i> will still come to fruition--it's already written and (almost) ready to roll. But without sufficient funds, its impact will be limited. I don't want to just reach vegans and animal advocates -- I need your help to reach those who might never have thought about the animals behind their meals.</p>
<p>Although I've never published a book before, I've been writing my entire life. I have years of training and even professional experience as an editor. I have also dabbled in graphic design since I was a teen. And I've been working in public campaigning for animals (including through media outreach, event organizing, social media, and advertising) for nearly a decade.</p>
<p>Although you might be taking a gamble on me, know that I live and breathe to fight for animals. This book has been the biggest undertaking of my life thus far, and I will throw my entire self into making it a success.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Mike Cramer. I'm an actor, producer, writer and adjunct professor. I live in New York City, but I grew up in Northern California. The gold country, Yosemite, Tahoe, King's Canyon, plus the central coast, are the places I remember from my youth. I've written two books, a play, and I've optioned a screenplay, but this is my most personal work: a collection of short stories inspired by the Sierra foothills and my family. </p>
<p>I've been writing the Van Winkle County stories for several years. I also adapted two stories I'd written earlier to fit into the series. Only one of them has been published to date. Short Stories ain't easy.</p>
<p>This is a passion project for me. It was inspired by my love for my Grandfather, who died in 2009 at the age of 90. He was straight out of a Norman Rockwell painting. He was a hunter and fisherman, served in the Pacific, and was the best grandpa anybody could ever have wanted. I'd been reading a lot of Faulkner and Hemingway when he passed, and began writing stories about a fictional county named for my mom's family, and its odd denizens. There's maybe 10% truth in the stories, and a whole lot of BS, which is how Grandpa would have liked them.  </p>
<p>Money is needed both to finish the project and to pay overhead (rent, phone bill) in August/September, when the book will be laid out. It will be a short book, just three or four stories. In large part it is meant to introduce these stories to a broad audience, in hopes of attracting some attention to them so that others can be placed in a couple of journals and magazines.  Selling short stories isn't easy (especially since Amazon stopped accepting new submissions to their Kindle Singles program). This is a way to monetize a few of them and, hopefully, build interest for the others. </p>
<p>If enough is raised, it will go to hiring a copy editor and graphic designer.  For five years, I ran the ePublishing unit of VoxPop, a cafe, bookstore, and publishing house in Brooklyn. I set up print runs, formatted and laid out text, arranged for editing and graphic design, and oversaw publication for dozens of books, so I know what is involved in a project like this. This campaign will help me get three of the stories published.

<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><i>Two Faces of a Patriot</i></h2>
<p>Two of the best science fiction “what if” stories ever written are Aldous Huxley’s <i>Brave New World</i> and George Orwell’s <i>1984</i>.</p>
<p>In <i>Brave New World</i> people are controlled by pleasure. In <i>1984</i> they are controlled by pain.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is something else.</p>
<p><i>Two Faces of a Patriot</i> is a compelling science fiction novel for our time. This powerful “what if” tale combines adventure, new tech and politics to keep you entertained and turning pages into the night as it presents an impending course of events, created by serious wrongdoings in the past, that must be averted at all cost.</p>
<p>The main storyline is set primarily in the near-future, at a time when paranoia, control and power have changed virtually everything in American society, where social engineering has severely limited nearly every personal freedom.</p>
<p>Welcome to 2025 and beyond.</p>
<p>All U.S. citizens carry biometric ID cards with retinal scans and photographs. A.I. monitors people’s daily moods, reactions and activities. Roughly half of all high school students are labeled with one or more mental disorders, managed by mind-bending drugs and tracked with chip implants. By law, all books must be digital, allowing DHS to identify potential terrorists.</p>
<p>With all that has changed, by 2035, tensions have risen dramatically.</p>
<p>Sides have been taken. Lines have been drawn.</p>
<p>Join Jonathon, Ashley and a host of other characters, some you will love and some you will hate, in a captivating and daring tale of right and wrong, good and evil.</p>
<p>Coming May 25, 2020  </p>
<h3>From Chapter One</h3>
<p>When Ashley Lawford bolted through the screening portal at the entrance to Barack Obama High School, red strobe lights flared and a security alarm erupted into an ear-splitting alert.</p>

</div></div>","Two Faces of a Patriot
Two of the best science fiction “what if” stories ever written are Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World and George Orwell’s 1984.
In Brave New World people are controlled by pleasure. In 1984 they are controlled by pain.
Perhaps it is something else.
Two Faces of a Patriot is a compelling science fiction novel for our time. This powerful “what if” tale combines adventure, new tech and politics to keep you entertained and turning pages into the night as it presents an impending course of events, created by serious wrongdoings in the past, that must be averted at all cost.
The main storyline is set primarily in the near-future, at a time when paranoia, control and power have changed virtually everything in American society, where social engineering has severely limited nearly every personal freedom.
Welcome to 2025 and beyond.
All U.S. citizens carry biometric ID cards with retinal scans and photographs. A.I. monitors people’s daily moods, reactions and activities. Roughly half of all high school students are labeled with one or more mental disorders, managed by mind-bending drugs and tracked with chip implants. By law, all books must be digital, allowing DHS to identify potential terrorists.
With all that has changed, by 2035, tensions have risen dramatically.
Sides have been taken. Lines have been drawn.
Join Jonathon, Ashley and a host of other characters, some you will love and some you will hate, in a captivating and daring tale of right and wrong, good and evil.
Coming May 25, 2020  
From Chapter One
When Ashley Lawford bolted through the screening portal at the entrance to Barack Obama High School, red strobe lights flared and a security alarm erupted into an ear-splitting alert.
It was so shrill that Jonathon Carr, who had entered right in front of her, dropped to one knee, threw his hands over his ears, and squeezed his eyes shut as if blocking his sight would turn the screeching off. 
Ashley remained standing, but was also covering her ears when the team of flak-jacketed DAA agents, guns drawn, faces hidden behind black-visored helmets, charged at her screaming, “On the floor! Get on the floor. Face down. Now! Now! Now!”
Ashley turned toward the men. “I just forgot—” was all she managed to get out before she was tased, crumpled to the floor, and started flopping around in the hallway like a freshly caught tuna.

<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Story of My Book</span></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Living with a mental health disorder is often associated with the idea of being “insane”, ""crazy"", ""troubled"", and anything and everything that suggests a peripheral divide between the norms of human nature. Such beliefs have, on occasion, led individuals struggling with their mental health to view themselves in the same light—as tarnished, crazy, and broken.<br/><br/>In Musings of a Broken Mind: A Collection of Poems and Prose, you will read about lived experiences and reflections from the perspective of a broken woman living in an equally broken world. The book follows the author’s journey from childhood, to leaving home at sixteen, to being adopted by a new family. It includes emails sent to her therapist, a romantic relationship, and her struggles with OCD and C-PTSD. <br/><br/>Musings of a Broken Mind gives the reader deeper insight into the factors that play a role in the formation of an individual’s life and identity. Some factors include culture, religion, trauma, family, environment, socioeconomic status, education, the unconscious, and more. Suleman believes that before any labels, disorders, and illnesses, we are humans—complex in our many facets that shape who we are and who we will become.<br/> </p>
<h3>The Book - Musings Of A Broken Mind</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>In Musings Of A Broken Mind you'll learn about the nuances of mental health and the impacts it has on parts of the narrator's life, including within friendships, family, clash of two different cultures, romance, schooling, and more. Some stories from my book include:</p>
<p>“Broken” a poem regarding the word ""broken"".</p>
<p>“Better Times,“ where I share stories about the relationship between my biological family and then my later adoptive family.</p>
<p>“Anxiety,'” in which I explore my thoughts and feelings surrounding my OCD.</p>
<p>You will love this book if you’re interested in understanding what the world looks like to someone who is living with comorbid mental health diagnoses.</p>

It's an inspiring guide to finding joy and hope in the world around us, and to falling back in love with life and ourselves.More About this book:One of modern America’s gifted wildlife artists, JoAnne Helfert Sullam has created fine oil/acrylic paintings of animals and landscapes that have been featured in the New York Times and have received special Congressional recognition. But her beautiful images actually only hint at the full depth of her deep connection to nature.    Now, in her candid and compelling memoir, Evolution of a Wild Heart, JoAnne reveals how a lifetime of observing and caring for birds, deer, a racoon, wolf and other creatures has brought her closer to not only the natural world but also her true self. She also offers readers ways they, too, can let nature spark a powerful inner transformation.    Little about JoAnne’s childhood suggested her future as an accomplished artist and naturalist. Growing up in an impoverished Brooklyn neighborhood, she didn’t have easy access to nature. She struggled with a learning disability in school and was unfairly stigmatized —a “misfit” status she eagerly embraced for a time.    But encounter after encounter with unforgettable animals gradually led her to discover her life’s purpose and the peace she’d found so elusive.

<h3>ABCville - The Beginning</h3>
<p>When Karen's children were little, they often made handmade books together about things happening in their lives and in their community.  With Karen's background teaching young children, she developed a love for sharing beautiful picture books with a younger generation. Karen began dreaming about creating a book like this about her community, Charlottesville, Virginia.  </p>

<p>That's when Karen reached out to her friend, Cary, a Charlottesville artist and photographer and they got to work. By combining their skills, Karen and Cary were able to visualize this project together. They headed out into the community to photograph 26 different spots around Charlottesville. They considered each letter carefully so that the book will engage young children.  They then spent over a year researching different publishing options for ABCville, and realized that self-publishing their local book would be the best fit.  They are ready to publish their first round of hardcover alphabet books by this fall.</p>

<h3>ABCville - The End (but really the beginning)</h3>
<p>This is where THEY need YOU! </p>
<p>In order to publish their first round of books, Karen and Cary will need:</p>
<ul>
<li>$6,915.90 - Publishing of 1,000 books (the most cost effective)</li>
<li>$500 - Professional design and editing</li>
<li>$350 - 2 sample books</li>
<li>$204 - shipping of books</li>
<li>$50 - ISBN #</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Since their book celebrates Charlottesville, they are reaching out for support from their local community! Karen and Cary hope that the community will recognize and share the value of a book like ABCville. </p>
<p>There will be a simple map of Charlottesville in the back of the book to help locate the places and objects represented in the book. Young children love to explore their environment and often notice details that adults may miss. ABCville is a way for them to explore our hometown. Some places will be very familiar to children and others will be a new discovery.  Karen and Cary's goal is to help children get excited as they make connections by exploring their community through ABCville!</p>
<p>If the total funding is secured by the end of this campaign, Karen and Cary will send the book off to the publisher for printing. The actual printing process will take 6-8 weeks.  Their anticipated date for having books in hand is sometime in early November.  </p>
<p>They will plan to send regular updates on the campaign progress and keep people informed on any changes on ship dates for all perks.   </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>If they don't meet their funding goal with this campaign, the publishing schedule for ABCville will be delayed. However, they would plan to apply for a small business loan. As Karen and Cary are both <a href=""https://cicville.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Community Investment Collaborative</a> (CIC) graduates, they would have access to several loan options.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Lon Michaels is a father, husband, singer/songwriter and author of “The Jesus Dilemma”. Lon is 51 years old and lives in up-state New York with his family. Lon has five children and has spent most of his life as a believer of Father God. Lon attended parochial school as a child and was already challenging the teachers of his Missouri Synod church by age twelve. Lon has always had issues with organized religion, as many people do.</p>
<p>This IndieGoGo campaign is about support, not money. I only need a small amount of money to realize the goal of getting “The Jesus Dilemma” into printed format. I am hoping that this campaign will raise awareness of the validity of a book like this. The book is intended to make people think, as my video says. If wide is the road that leads to destruction and narrow the path that leads to righteousness, how can so many non-bible reading Christians all be right?</p>
<p>By lending your support, I expect that you will read all or most of the final draft PDF, and spread the word about “The Jesus Dilemma”. I hope to inspire as many people as possible with this book. I am not about selling millions of copies, but that would be nice. I am not in this for money, although that would be nice too. I am in this because it has been a work in progress for over 15 years in the making and I feel that I have been led and inspired to take this to the finish line. The goal is $2,000.00. With as little of a contribution of ten dollars to be among the first to read it. I hope you will give your support.</p>

<h2><strong>CHAPTER 1</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Father John Martin was stunned. His eyes watered, his legs buckled. He was in awe at what he had just read. He could not believe or comprehend the knowledge that had finally been given to him.  </p>
<p>       John was not sure what happened next. He was not sure if he fainted or collapsed. All he knew was that suddenly he was lying on the floor of the most sacred and secret room in the Vatican’s archives. He also knew that in his sudden state, his bladder functions had given out and that he had urinated all over the floor and himself.</p>
<p>       The tears in his eyes and on his face were like acid. They both burned and tasted like he was licking a battery. John prayed another prayer like so many, only this time he asked God to kill him. He prayed to die right where he was. He asked God to forgive him for being such a trusting dupe. He asked God to hold his heart and his hand. He asked God to take back all the prayers that he had prayed in vain. He asked God to forgive him for hating his father. He asked God one more time to take his life and then he passed out.</p>
<p>       When John awoke, he was not sure how long he had been out. There was no electricity in this cavern of the Vatican. Priests were not allowed to wear watches or any other types of jewelry that related to the secular world. The things that he could wear were his priestly robes, his white neckband and the beautiful golden cross around his neck.</p>
<p>       When he came to Father John was still very lethargic. He somehow mustered the strength to sit up and lean his solid frame against the rock hard stonewalls of the Vatican’s hidden room. His thoughts wandered and he cried over people that he once loved and abandoned because they did not believe as he once did.</p>
<p>       John grabbed his throat and tried in some feeble way to choke himself. The tears flowed even harder. Several minutes passed and he gave up trying to choke the life out of himself. His thoughts raced. He thought about his father, that he had always considered an asshole. He thought about his mother, who had taken him to church three times a week and was the reason he became a priest.</p>
<p>       John tried again to raise himself to his feet. He pulled on the desk he was collapsed next to. He pulled on the candlestick, but the candle just fell. He picked up the candle because he knew that if he did not the whole room could burn.</p>
<p>       Father John Martin yanked the white piece of cloth from around his neck. He looked at it and then held it up to the candle. The cloth took a moment to burn, then it quickly incinerated in his hand. John’s fingers started to burn as the cloth gave into the desire of the flame. Another tear came down his face. He knew that his life had been lived in vain.</p>
<p>       What John had read was inconceivable, but he knew it to be right. He knew with everything inside him that it was right. John had read, among other things, that the Vatican and the Catholic Church was hiding the true names of God and His Messiah and had been since 1611. The conspiracy went all the way up to the Pope and had for generations. The power had been stripped from God’s name and His Messiah and this was just the tip of the iceberg.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
Lon Michaels is a father, husband, singer/songwriter and author of “The Jesus Dilemma”. Lon is 51 years old and lives in up-state New York with his family. Lon has five children and has spent most of his life as a believer of Father God. Lon attended parochial school as a child and was already challenging the teachers of his Missouri Synod church by age twelve. Lon has always had issues with organized religion, as many people do.
This IndieGoGo campaign is about support, not money. I only need a small amount of money to realize the goal of getting “The Jesus Dilemma” into printed format. I am hoping that this campaign will raise awareness of the validity of a book like this. The book is intended to make people think, as my video says. If wide is the road that leads to destruction and narrow the path that leads to righteousness, how can so many non-bible reading Christians all be right?
By lending your support, I expect that you will read all or most of the final draft PDF, and spread the word about “The Jesus Dilemma”. I hope to inspire as many people as possible with this book. I am not about selling millions of copies, but that would be nice. I am not in this for money, although that would be nice too. I am in this because it has been a work in progress for over 15 years in the making and I feel that I have been led and inspired to take this to the finish line. The goal is $2,000.00. With as little of a contribution of ten dollars to be among the first to read it. I hope you will give your support.

CHAPTER 1
 
Father John Martin was stunned. His eyes watered, his legs buckled. He was in awe at what he had just read. He could not believe or comprehend the knowledge that had finally been given to him.  
       John was not sure what happened next. He was not sure if he fainted or collapsed. All he knew was that suddenly he was lying on the floor of the most sacred and secret room in the Vatican’s archives. He also knew that in his sudden state, his bladder functions had given out and that he had urinated all over the floor and himself.
       The tears in his eyes and on his face were like acid. They both burned and tasted like he was licking a battery. John prayed another prayer like so many, only this time he asked God to kill him. He prayed to die right where he was. He asked God to forgive him for being such a trusting dupe. He asked God to hold his heart and his hand. He asked God to take back all the prayers that he had prayed in vain. He asked God to forgive him for hating his father. He asked God one more time to take his life and then he passed out.
       When John awoke, he was not sure how long he had been out. There was no electricity in this cavern of the Vatican. Priests were not allowed to wear watches or any other types of jewelry that related to the secular world. The things that he could wear were his priestly robes, his white neckband and the beautiful golden cross around his neck.
       When he came to Father John was still very lethargic. He somehow mustered the strength to sit up and lean his solid frame against the rock hard stonewalls of the Vatican’s hidden room. His thoughts wandered and he cried over people that he once loved and abandoned because they did not believe as he once did.

<h3>Let's Build A Time Machine!</h3>
<p>I am not a quantum physicist.</p>
<p>Neither am I the leader of a psychedelic cult.</p>
<p>In my novel, ""Breaking Yesterday,"" it takes a man who is a bit of both to successfully build a time portal to the past.</p>
<p>But you don't have him. You have me. And the only way I know how to do this is through my imagination and a bit of inventive writing. To bring that to life, I need your help.</p>
<h3>The Story</h3>
</div><div>
<p><strong><i>You can have whatever you want. Under one condition.</i></strong></p>
<p>Laurel Martin and Jig Klein have nothing in common other than a smooth talking abductor offering an enticing reward for their cooperation. The mysterious kidnapper claims to have mastered time travel, and they are free to use it to fulfill their deepest desires…if they first step 2,000 years into the past, kill the young Jesus Christ and forever wipe Christianity from the pages of history.</p>
<p>Friends and family launch a desperate search for the missing pair. They uncover a puzzle of ruthlessly executed technology, dark family secrets and a shadowy cult seduced by an ancient evil. An evil that will stop at nothing to reshape eternity to its liking.</p>
<h3>Some Preliminary Reactions</h3>
<p>""Brent Baker has masterfully melded two exciting genres in this gripping novel - spiritual warfare and science fiction. Buckle up, it is fast paced reading, start to finish!"" - Steve M.</p>
<p>""The greatest compliment in my mind about how good a book is ... when you hate getting to that last page and you absolutely cannot wait for the sequel! That's THIS book!"" - Stephanie H.</p>
<h3>My Needs and Your Perks</h3>
<p>The initial estimates for a successful time-travel expedition: $7,500 for all the basics. Quite a deal compared to hiring your friendly neighborhood physicist / cult guru. And safer, too. (Note that I've already filled the VISA up with some of this stuff!)</p>
<p>So, what's that go to?</p>
<ul>
<li>An editor to professionally hone the manuscript. You wouldn't want to end up in the wrong year. Or have the story lead you into a dead end from which there is no return.</li>
<li>An artist to design a really cool cover so that people know what they're in for at their first glance. Besides, a time portal needs to look cool. At least, better than Marty McFly and Dr. Brown's DeLorean.</li>
<li>The first run of hardcover and softcover books so those who order up their voyage through time can be satisfied  in short order. Time travel should not involve delays.</li>
<li>A series of character portraits for the limited hardcover edition, created by my cover artist Caleb W. Knowlton.</li>
<li>Other production and marketing costs, like advertising, templating apps and a thousand other odds and ends that have to come together all at the same time.</li>
<li>What do you get? Check out the options in the ""perks"" boxes (you can get more information by clicking on them)!</li>
<li>If you have an idea for a different perk that you would like for donating feel free to contact me at brbaker@steepslope.pub.  There's probably things I haven't thought of! </li>
</ul>
<h3>Bonus Goals</h3>
<p>If we reach our $7,500 goal, there is more to be done that can take the book to another level! If we reach:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>$11,000 - A lot of people love their audio books. I'll have it done professionally - that means NOT BY ME - so that ""audio readers"" can have it in their favorite format.</p></li>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">$14,000</span><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">- There is a song involved with the climax of the book. I'll have the song professionally performed and produced to be released with the book. How many time travel adventures come with a song? This one could!</span>
</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The story is meant to be fun, but there's a lot to learn through even the craziest of tales. So, while the plot involves murderous time-traveling cultists, that's not all that's going on. At its heart, it's a story about faith and family, grief and betrayal, encountering God and deciding what that means. There are unlikely heroes and everyday villains, as well as ... well, I'm not going to give it all away here!</p>

<h2><strong>Summary of Purpose</strong></h2>
<p>I am very thankful you decided to share a bit of your attention. I know the value of attention and how many things are simultaneously competing for just a few precious moments.  Out of respect for your attention, I will try to be as brief as possible while still being thorough enough to convey the necessary information. I encourage anyone seeking more information to contact me for a more thorough discussion.</p>
<p>When I set out on the path that brought me here, I didn't have intentions of writing a book or developing new concepts. As a young adult, it became evident that the current worldview I held lacked any real explanatory power. Consequently, I spent many years in isolated and independent research, the depth of which was not designed to develop expertise, but to discern what I could about Reality.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong> Reality, objective: </strong><i>Capitalized in this context to denote that which is external of the mind. This use may refer to Reality as a whole or a specific part thereof, whereas the colloquial use of reality denotes an individual's personal, subjective definitions or assumptions of what is real.</i></p>
<p>The more I researched, observed, and interacted with others, it became very clear that there are two main categories of worldviews (approaches to interpreting Reality). The way we each interpret reality seems the obvious culprit for much of the world's strife and the difficulty found overall in addressing the human condition. The two main categories are:</p>
<p><i>a) Those based on belief, faith, or ideas of how it 'should' be.</i></p>
<p><i>b) Those based on what evidence, observation, data, and logic can describe.</i></p>
<p>Within these categories are all the religious, philosophical, and scientific worldviews, all of which have various interpretations. When these are embraced by their respective communities and take on specific methods and theories of how to view reality, they may be known as paradigms.</p>
<p>The lack of agreement on interpretation does appear to be the driving force of conflict between those operating within opposing paradigmatic views. However, what truly became a profound puzzle was that differing interpretations within the same paradigm also had dramatic negative effects and often with more dire consequences.</p>
<p>Moving downward in group size from populations that ascribe to a given paradigm to those that hold differing interpretations of the same paradigmatic fundamentals, downward again to the size of small and homogeneous sects, all the way down to any two individuals which outwardly share similar descriptions of their worldviews, will all have some variations in their interpretation and, likely, could hold to considerable differences of views with drastic interpersonal consequences. All of which supposedly exists under the auspices of a single paradigmatic worldview.</p>
<p>Yet, that is not where the disparity ends. Humans are capable of disagreement even within their own mind. Cognitive dissonance describes holding to thoughts and beliefs that are inconsistent with our behavior. Denialism refers to simply denying Reality in favor of something more comfortable or appealing. These and many other internal conflicts are quite avoidable within the correct frame of reference, but can be paralyzing when not addressed properly.</p>
<p>Disagreement upon reality is such a ubiquitous part of human nature it seems it is just simply accepted as unavoidable. However, I hope this book will demonstrate that disagreement only exists within subjective realities and there is no room for disagreement, or a great many other limitations on humanity, within Reality.</p>
<p>When you become aware of the inequality between what we think is real and what actually is real, you begin to see how this form of ignorance influences nearly every aspect of our daily lives and decisions. As I challenged my own views and eventually those of others, three principles, adopted early in my journey down this path, consistently guided the way.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>Adapted from the field of medicine:</i></p>
<p><strong>1) Symptomatic treatment has no place in a reality-based worldview:</strong> In other words, applying a feel-good bandage does nothing to stop the hemorrhaging caused by ignorance and false beliefs. You may kiss away the immediate sting of reality when it is not to someone's liking, but you have weakened your patient's immune system to further illness.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>Adapted from the field of computer science:</i></p>
<p><strong>2)</strong> <strong>Garbage in, garbage out:</strong> If your worldview is constructed from inputting nonsensical data, you should expect the output of your emotions and behavior to be equally nonsensical. If you hold a belief that is based on erroneous or misunderstood information, it is unlikely that your ability to affect or influence matters surrounding the 'bad data""will translate well to the real world, no matter how much you believe that it will.</p>
<p>As an example, if a friend tells you that today is August 1, but it is actually August 2, unless that is an important day, you may not be in too much trouble. However, if someone tells you that Friday is actually the day of the week that follows Monday, and you hold to this belief faithfully for the rest of your life, you are likely going to experience a great amount of turmoil that is going to make interacting with the rest of society quite challenging, even if it leads to a short work week! In addition, the more bad data you have in your programming, the harder it becomes to discern what is actually reliable information.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>Adapted from the field of law within the social sciences:</i></p>
<p><strong>3)</strong> <strong>Reserved Judgment:</strong> You should only ascribe to a belief or position if there is sufficient and justifiable evidence or logic to do so. In any situation where you hold to a proposition, you should constantly be willing to update or throw out the belief as new information becomes available. In the case that you are unable to reasonably support a belief or idea, you should withhold judgment until you have sufficient evidence to make a decision. Sufficient  evidence  is not satisfied by the notion of ""beyond a reasonable doubt"", but should be extended to ""beyond the shadow of a doubt"". When we adopt an incorrect view, it may prevent us from coming to the correct answer. To borrow further from the legal field, we should adapt what is known as Blackstone's ratio to read as; it is better that ten possible answers are denied rather than failing to arrive at one correct answer.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Bigger than a Book</strong></h3>
<p>From here, I trust that you will recognize the necessity of this work and the potential benefit it could bring to human society as a whole. If you have ever felt disheartened by the atrocities, injustices, or callousness of others, recognize the larger problem is that by giving credence to the implausible, you accommodate the existence of the injurious.</p>
<p>This book will not be presenting new research in the different academic fields it spans, nor will it be an attempt at a comprehensive education of the reader in those respective fields. However, I hope to bring relevant insights that offer the strongest support of the concept. Where appropriate, further readings and other informative content will be suggested should the reader desire to look deeper.</p>
<p>The first half of the book will address the supporting evidence and reasoning behind the concept. The second half of the book will be a complete presentation of the concept of <i>The Inequality of Consciousness to Reality</i>, including the conceptualized mathematical expressions and equations that offer an incredibly simple perspective and the philosophical argument which offers a compelling rationale for applying the concept in daily life. The book then concludes with what is meant by <i>A Common Paradigm</i>, why it is necessary, what humanity may look like united under such a common view, and what steps individuals and societies can take to embrace such a bold vision.</p>
<p>Although subject to change during the final stages of writing and editing, here is the current structuring of the book:</p>
<p> </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>The Inequality of Consciousness To Reality</strong></h2>

<h3><strong>Goals</strong></h3>
<p>To be clear, I am not affiliated with a university or organization and I have no publisher or any other resource to assist me in this monumental project. I have self-funded this every step of the way so far with an enormous investment of time and personal resources.</p>
<p>I believe, and hope you agree, that the time is now to bring this work to the public. We have made too much progress as an emerging global society to allow fake news, alternative facts, denial of evidence, and concerted deception to set us back.</p>
<p>I am setting the campaign goals in accordance with moderate to conservative cost estimates. In other words, I ask that the stated funding goal be taken as a minimum, and I would encourage those who are able, to give according to their means to propel this far beyond those minimum goals. </p>

<h3><strong>About The Perks</strong></h3>
<p>Of course, I believe that the greatest value is in the concept, itself. That being said, it is important to offer substantive perks that go beyond just pre-ordering the book. </p>
<p><strong>Paradigm Pioneers ($100 or more)</strong></p>
<p>The<strong> </strong>Paradigm Pioneers, so named because they are the first to support the concept, will have a special and honored place throughout the future of this endeavor. This will be further defined as the organization grows, but the following are some of the advantages of becoming a Paradigm Pioneer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lifetime membership to the organization: No dues or fees</li>
<li>Lifetime membership to the access the websites paid content and services upon its future launch</li>
<li>Recognition of your early support on a special section of the website dedicated to the Pioneers</li>
<li>A special letter of acknowledgment of the significance of your early support</li>
<li>A permanent discount of 50% off all promotional merchandise made available through the website</li>
</ul>
<p><i>These benefits are tied to the registration of the Paradigm Pioneer and are non-transferable, however, you may designate a recipient if you choose to gift the membership to another. At higher tiers, multiple memberships are offered and may be assigned as needed by the contributor.</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>List of Tiers</b></p>
<p>Be sure to read the descriptions of the perks, notes on pre-orders and memberships, shipping on add-on items outside of the continental U.S and conditions on coaching/consulting sessions.</p>
<p>Indiegogo limits 10 quantities total of items per perk, so there may be only a quantity of one listed in the perk, but may actually be multiple quantities in the descriptions. The quantities in the description are the correct amount associated with that perk.</p>
<p>If you have an idea for a perk or a special request, I am more than happy to negotiate! Be sure to contact me prior to your contribution if this is the case.</p>

<h3><strong>A Vision of the Future</strong></h3>
<p>It is my hope that you see the project as a vision of the future rather than as a snapshot of the present. To be successful, this will require a collective effort. Please share this page with your networks. Take the time to carefully consider just what this could mean for every individual and society and mention this in your discussions with family and friends.</p>
<p>I am willing to take as much time as necessary to have conversations about why I believe in this concept and to convince you to share my convictions. Feel free to contact me through any of the available means on this site, through my website, email, or social media.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></h3>
<p>If there is anyway you would like to contribute beyond crowd-funding, there are many needs that could be met through volunteering, pro bono, and other means. We'll find a way to work together no matter your skill set.</p>
<p>Some examples of needs are marketing, community organizing and campaigning, web design, legal support, expert consultations, testimonials, reviews, and any other way you feel could be supportive.</p>
<p>And that's all there is to it!</p>

</div></div>","Summary of Purpose
I am very thankful you decided to share a bit of your attention. I know the value of attention and how many things are simultaneously competing for just a few precious moments.  Out of respect for your attention, I will try to be as brief as possible while still being thorough enough to convey the necessary information. I encourage anyone seeking more information to contact me for a more thorough discussion.
When I set out on the path that brought me here, I didn't have intentions of writing a book or developing new concepts. As a young adult, it became evident that the current worldview I held lacked any real explanatory power. Consequently, I spent many years in isolated and independent research, the depth of which was not designed to develop expertise, but to discern what I could about Reality.
 Reality, objective: Capitalized in this context to denote that which is external of the mind. This use may refer to Reality as a whole or a specific part thereof, whereas the colloquial use of reality denotes an individual's personal, subjective definitions or assumptions of what is real.
The more I researched, observed, and interacted with others, it became very clear that there are two main categories of worldviews (approaches to interpreting Reality). The way we each interpret reality seems the obvious culprit for much of the world's strife and the difficulty found overall in addressing the human condition. The two main categories are:
a) Those based on belief, faith, or ideas of how it 'should' be.
b) Those based on what evidence, observation, data, and logic can describe.
Within these categories are all the religious, philosophical, and scientific worldviews, all of which have various interpretations. When these are embraced by their respective communities and take on specific methods and theories of how to view reality, they may be known as paradigms.
The lack of agreement on interpretation does appear to be the driving force of conflict between those operating within opposing paradigmatic views. However, what truly became a profound puzzle was that differing interpretations within the same paradigm also had dramatic negative effects and often with more dire consequences.
Moving downward in group size from populations that ascribe to a given paradigm to those that hold differing interpretations of the same paradigmatic fundamentals, downward again to the size of small and homogeneous sects, all the way down to any two individuals which outwardly share similar descriptions of their worldviews, will all have some variations in their interpretation and, likely, could hold to considerable differences of views with drastic interpersonal consequences. All of which supposedly exists under the auspices of a single paradigmatic worldview.
Yet, that is not where the disparity ends. Humans are capable of disagreement even within their own mind. Cognitive dissonance describes holding to thoughts and beliefs that are inconsistent with our behavior. Denialism refers to simply denying Reality in favor of something more comfortable or appealing. These and many other internal conflicts are quite avoidable within the correct frame of reference, but can be paralyzing when not addressed properly.
Disagreement upon reality is such a ubiquitous part of human nature it seems it is just simply accepted as unavoidable. However, I hope this book will demonstrate that disagreement only exists within subjective realities and there is no room for disagreement, or a great many other limitations on humanity, within Reality.
When you become aware of the inequality between what we think is real and what actually is real, you begin to see how this form of ignorance influences nearly every aspect of our daily lives and decisions. As I challenged my own views and eventually those of others, three principles, adopted early in my journey down this path, consistently guided the way.

Bigger than a Book
From here, I trust that you will recognize the necessity of this work and the potential benefit it could bring to human society as a whole. If you have ever felt disheartened by the atrocities, injustices, or callousness of others, recognize the larger problem is that by giving credence to the implausible, you accommodate the existence of the injurious.

The second half of the book will be a complete presentation of the concept of The Inequality of Consciousness to Reality, including the conceptualized mathematical expressions and equations that offer an incredibly simple perspective and the philosophical argument which offers a compelling rationale for applying the concept in daily life. The book then concludes with what is meant by A Common Paradigm, why it is necessary, what humanity may look like united under such a common view, and what steps individuals and societies can take to embrace such a bold vision.
Although subject to change during the final stages of writing and editing, here is the current structuring of the book:

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>In 2010, I wanted to quit my job and become an entrepreneur. In December 2012, I quit my job to become an entrepreneur and <strong>FAILED</strong> <u>miserably</u>! I lost everything because I did everything wrong and thought I could figure it all out myself. When I had to go back into the workforce, <i>I felt so defeated.</i> But going back to work was the <u>best decision I could have ever made</u>. While working I learned how to build and sustain several profitable businesses. And yes, I made some major mistakes along the way. While working with my business coaching clients, I share <strong>my mistakes,</strong> as well as how <strong>I built several successful and profitable side businesses</strong> the <u>right way</u>.</p>
<p>Now, I want to share this information to more people who want to start and grow successful and money making business while they are still working at their job. This book is a <strong>labor of love</strong> because I am transparent about my mistakes and failure (<i>so painful to relive them</i>). But, I feel it is necessary to let people know they are not alone and it is possible to be a <strong>DUALpreneur® (Employee + Entrepreneur)</strong> ... to eventually become a full-time entrepreneur, if that is their desire.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I am a screenwriter in Hollywood, but I have been in love with fantasy for ages. As a father of five children, I have personally navigated enchanting forests and bubbly brooks, and clever fairies of my own, while creating stories to tell my children at bedtime. I have a passion for storytelling and I believe that Georgiana learns some principles that  children and every parent, teacher, coach and business leader can also learn from.</p>
<p>A Pixie Day! encompasses the vibrant themes of self-discovery and healthy curiosity that are the pillars of solid character and good will. Through this work, I seek to inspire strength and confidence in children of all ages.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are seeking $15,000 to create and sell a  32-page beautiful hardbound and fully illustrated  children's book. We want to market this book to reach families who are seeking thoughtful and wholesome stories that they can read to their children. We also want to market this book to business leaders, parents, teachers and coaches who are looking for motivational messages, inspiration and insights into the art of setting and reaching goals and dreams.</p>
<p>We have several fabulous and unusual perks, one of which is rather amazing: The illustrator, Marina, will  draw you or a child right INTO an 11""x14"" illustration from the book. Suitable for framing. How amazing would that be for a child (or adult)?</p>
<p>Whether we reach our goal or not, we will still use the funds to print books and market our project on social media.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Feel free to explain more about your campaign and let people know the difference their contribution will make:</p>
<ul>
<li>We live in a world that has grown cynical in many ways. I hope that the stories of Georgiana can show how thoughtfulness, trust, curiosity and a little magic can help create a world of love, joy of discovery, and tolerance.</li>
<li>An important goal for anyone of any age is that of achieving success, discovering our unique talents, and grabbing hold of our dreams. This book offers a bright and cheery approach to dreaming and achieving those dreams. It's a bit of an old-fashioned approach in a world that could use some old-fashioned approaches.</li>
<li>I've written this story (and a few more) because I believe that there is a child in all of us that is searching for meaning and hoping to find out what our gifts and talents are. Georgiana has a unique journey. I think you'll be surprised at what she she discovers.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Every publisher and agent I've talked to loves the idea of my story and the illustrations, but they seem to be looking for something more relevant to todays issues of sexual identity and acceptance. My book swims against the current and simply looks into the world of a young girl who wants to feel the magic and wants to communicate to the forest creatures around her. So, ironically, this book is not what publishers are seeking even though it's what children need.</p>
<p>I've owned companies, consulted to many individuals and companies, and  written hundreds of business plans. I know what it takes to achieve my goals and succeed. My goal is to not only publish my children's book, but to also market it to several different segments of readers.</p>
<p>In order to be successful, I am committed to an aggressive social media and advertising campaign, and make effective use of my 29,000 contacts and followers on Linkedin, Facebook and Instagram.</p>

<p><u><strong>The ""Why"" </strong></u></p>
<p>“Seoul Girl” Lost then Found (Story of a Korean adoptee and her journey from South Korea to the USA)</p>
<p>The warmth of the Colorado sun comes thru the windows as I savor my morning coffee with my loving husband and puppies around me. I have a good life. Going back about 60 years ago a small, scrawny baby was left at the front door of an orphanage many miles away in a crowded city of Seoul, South Korea. That fragile baby hanging on to a thread of life was named Adela Kim. And this is my journey from South Korea to America. From feeling Abandoned to feeling Loved.</p>
<p>Truly, the story started before I was born with the Korean War in the 1950’s. During this time many babies were born out of wedlock or left orphans due to the war. A couple named Harry and Bertha Holt were touched and moved by the stories out of South Korea of many homeless babies. Traveling to Korea and seeing the huge need for families for these children they started an orphanage called Holt Adoption.</p>
<p>I was born on June 10, 1960. These orphanages were started by the Holts on their own money and in sparse places. Where many abandoned babies died. God had His hand in my life and I not only survived but I flourished. There was a plan and a way for my life that would unfold many decades later. The huge blessing showered on me by God would completely sink in as an adult.</p>
<p>The reason why this campaign is important to me is to share the life of an adoptee and those who feel like an ""outsider."" Also, to inspire and learn from my story.  Like everyone I have had some great successes and huge failures.  No matter your background you will take away a nugget you can apply to your life.</p>

Books are expensive and rare even in the capital, so we wanted to create a space where emerging and established Mozambican publishers and writers could sell their books. </p><p> </p><p>Ethale Publishing was founded in 2016 by British journalist Alex Macbeth and Mozambican journalist Jessemusse Cacinda. The publishing house was born out of Festival Fim do Caminho, and has since evolved to publish 15 print titles (including by Wole Soyinka and Ngugi wa Thiong'o), develop an app for e-books and to launching a broadcasting arm, among other projects. </p><p> </p><p>We set up the store because we had to act to address the dearth of books in Mozambique. We invested our profits from other projects, as well as our own savings, to start it – it has been hard work! But in order to keep this space for writers, readers and the literary scene alive during this difficult period, we need a little support from any fans of our work out there!</p><p> </p><p>Every donation is going to help us pay rent, which is literally going to help to keep the bookshop alive. By guaranteeing our two full-time staff (not the founders – we work pretty much for the love of the project) salaries, we can seek new business, which in turn helps offset any losses in the store. We need time to build a customer base and to market the store to make it sustainable. So every donation is literally going to contribute directly to making the bookstore a success. </p><p> </p><p><u><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></u></p><p> </p><p>We need a 6-month cushion to be able to weather the current pandemic. We had planned to fund the store with profits from other projects. Sadly some of those projects have fallen through or have been postponed because of COVID. All the money we get will go towards paying rent for the store, and to paying the salaries of our marketing and shop personnel (Halima and Winealine, see video).

Our campaign met its target goal and is now in what Indiegogo calls 'InDemand'.  If you would still like to make a donation, you can, by selecting one of the perk packages available below. Any contributions we still receive will help us navigate this difficult period and make a huge difference. Thank you again to everyone who contributed! You can also support our work on a permanent basis by becoming a 'Patron Member' of Ethale Publishing on Patreon.  Short SummaryLast year we opened a bookstore to sell African books in Maputo, Mozambique. Books are expensive and rare even in the capital, so we wanted to create a space where emerging and established Mozambican publishers and writers could sell their books.  Ethale Publishing was founded in 2016 by British journalist Alex Macbeth and Mozambican journalist Jessemusse Cacinda. The publishing house was born out of Festival Fim do Caminho, and has since evolved to publish 15 print titles (including by Wole Soyinka and Ngugi wa Thiong'o), develop an app for e-books and to launching a broadcasting arm, among other projects.  We set up the store because we had to act to address the dearth of books in Mozambique. We invested our profits from other projects, as well as our own savings, to start it – it has been hard work! But in order to keep this space for writers, readers and the literary scene alive during this difficult period, we need a little support from any fans of our work out there! Every donation is going to help us pay rent, which is literally going to help to keep the bookshop alive. By guaranteeing our two full-time staff (not the founders – we work pretty much for the love of the project) salaries, we can seek new business, which in turn helps offset any losses in the store. We need time to build a customer base and to market the store to make it sustainable. So every donation is literally going to contribute directly to making the bookstore a success.  What We Need & What You Get We need a 6-month cushion to be able to weather the current pandemic. We had planned to fund the store with profits from other projects. Sadly some of those projects have fallen through or have been postponed because of COVID. All the money we get will go towards paying rent for the store, and to paying the salaries of our marketing and shop personnel (Halima and Winealine, see video). Any additional funding will be used to increase stock, cover utility bills or marketing or personnel costs  We want the people who support us to become part of our work. Perks range from having a book edition dedicated to you, having a shelf in our store, or a section in our app, named after you.

David The Dreidel - the history

The first few stanzas of David the Dreidel were written years ago, during my time as ""Head of the Fun-raising Committee"" and Marketing Coordinator at the Boulder JCC. I had a knack for creating parody songs like ""Just Donate"" and ""Welcome to Purim"". 
The idea behind David the Dreidel actually started as a joke. While planning our young professional Chanukah party, my committee convinced me to lead the opening ceremony dressed in an adult dreidel costume. Then, on the day before the first night of Chanukah, I wore the costume to the preschool and the kids lit up with excitement when they saw an adult-sized dreidel. The costume quickly took a life of its own, showing up at Chanukah concerts and community events, all the while making children laugh and smile! 
I went home buzzing with the joy of the holiday after one of these events and the song idea hit me in the middle of the night. For years it never went beyond my notebook or a few stray bars hummed with friends. 
Then, 2 years ago, my daughter was born and she instantly had a deep love for books. After celebrating this past Chanukah with her and seeing her joy when I sang the David the Dreidel song, I was inspired to turn the song into a full-length children's book to share with my daughter and kiddos across the world!
I am thrilled to introduce this heartwarming Chanukah story to families across the country!

Brighton, MA 02135. I will be submitting my payment on June 30th because
 Indigogo takes 15 days to disburse the funds to me and because I'll be requesting a loan to make up whatever I can't fundraise. So even though the

consideration of the others arts—painting, music, cinema, dance, and new 
media. <br/><br/>The program consists of daily <b>
writing workshops</b>, <b>studio visits</b> with guest artists as well as<b> nightly 
readings</b> by visiting poets. At the Ashbery Home School I will study with award-winning poets such as <a href=""http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/adam-fitzgerald"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Adam Fitzgerald</a>, <a href=""http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/timothy-donnelly"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Timothy Donnelly</a>,  <a href=""http://www.cathyparkhong.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Cathy Park Hong</a>, <a href=""http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/monica-de-la-torre"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Mónica de la Torre</a>, and <a href=""http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/dorothea-lasky"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Dorothea Lasky </a>along with many more. I will get the opportunity to network and learn about the craft of poetry from mentors I have admired throughout my career and never thought I'd get the opportunity to meet. The Ashbery Home School is in partnership with the Bass Museum, Miami Beach Women’s Club, and the Wolfsonian-FIU Museum. <br/><br/>The Home School was created in the name of <a href=""http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/john-ashbery"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">John Ashbery</a>, a Pulitzer Prize, National Book Award, and National 
Book Critics Circle Award winner. President Obama presented Ashbery with <a href=""http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/books/2013/02/interview-with-a-writer-john-ashbery/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">a National Humanities Medal at the White House in 2012</a>. At the culmination of the workshop I will get to meet John Ashbery himself, and perform my poetry for him!!!<br/><br/><div> <h3>A Second Chance</h3>I was first accepted to The Ashbery Home 
School in Dec 2014. This was the first-ever opening of the program to 
take place in Hudson, NY in John Ashbery's very own 19th Century home. 
As you can imagine I was ecstatic to go, but was unable to make up the 
funds with my work-study student job. When I received the email from the
 Home School founder, Adam Fitzgerald saying there were only 5 available
 spots, my heart dropped knowing I would not be able to attend. <br/><br/>Months later I receive an email from Adam announcing the grand opening of <b>The Ashbery Home School Miami Beach</b>
 and I knew I have to find a way to fund my passion. Part of what makes 
the idea of attending the home school even possible is that my family 
lives in South Florida, so I will not have to pay for accommodation, 
making it more likely for me to be able to afford the costs. Also, because I was recently accepted to the Home School I do not have to reapply, but have only until June 1, 2015 to enroll, before they start their second wave of applications. If I let this opportunity slip me, it is unlikely I will get chosen to attend the Home School a second time, and even more unlikely for it to be hosted in my hometown, where I will have access to meals and housing free of charge. Please help me make this dream a reality, anything helps. <br/><br/>

donate, but the campaign is already closed. If you still wish to donate 
or know someone who does they are welcome to write a check for ""Mireidys
 Garcia"" and send it to my home address at 8 Colliston Rd. Unit 2 
Brighton, MA 02135. I will be submitting my payment on June 30th because
 Indigogo takes 15 days to disburse the funds to me and because I'll be requesting a loan to make up whatever I can't fundraise. So even though the 
campaign is closed they still have till June 30th. Thanks again,Mireidys Help fund my attendance at the Ashbery Home School Poetry Conference in Miami Beach, FL. Contributions for the purposes of The Ashbery Home School must be made 
payable to Mireidys Garcia and are tax-deductible to the extent 
permitted by law.More About the Ashbery Home SchoolI've been chosen to attend as 1 of 60 poets out of 200+ applications from all over the U.S. The Ashbery Home School welcomes poets seeking to redefine their practice through a radical 
consideration of the others arts—painting, music, cinema, dance, and new 
media. The program consists of daily 
writing workshops, studio visits with guest artists as well as nightly 
readings by visiting poets. At the Ashbery Home School I will study with award-winning poets such as Adam Fitzgerald, Timothy Donnelly,  Cathy Park Hong, Mónica de la Torre, and Dorothea Lasky along with many more. I will get the opportunity to network and learn about the craft of poetry from mentors I have admired throughout my career and never thought I'd get the opportunity to meet. The Ashbery Home School is in partnership with the Bass Museum, Miami Beach Women’s Club, and the Wolfsonian-FIU Museum. The Home School was created in the name of John Ashbery, a Pulitzer Prize, National Book Award, and National 
Book Critics Circle Award winner. President Obama presented Ashbery with a National Humanities Medal at the White House in 2012. At the culmination of the workshop I will get to meet John Ashbery himself, and perform my poetry for him!!! A Second ChanceI was first accepted to The Ashbery Home 
School in Dec 2014. This was the first-ever opening of the program to 
take place in Hudson, NY in John Ashbery's very own 19th Century home. 
As you can imagine I was ecstatic to go, but was unable to make up the 
funds with my work-study student job. When I received the email from the
 Home School founder, Adam Fitzgerald saying there were only 5 available
 spots, my heart dropped knowing I would not be able to attend. Months later I receive an email from Adam announcing the grand opening of The Ashbery Home School Miami Beach
 and I knew I have to find a way to fund my passion. Part of what makes 
the idea of attending the home school even possible is that my family 
lives in South Florida, so I will not have to pay for accommodation, 
making it more likely for me to be able to afford the costs. Also, because I was recently accepted to the Home School I do not have to reapply, but have only until June 1, 2015 to enroll, before they start their second wave of applications. If I let this opportunity slip me, it is unlikely I will get chosen to attend the Home School a second time, and even more unlikely for it to be hosted in my hometown, where I will have access to meals and housing free of charge. Please help me make this dream a reality, anything helps. 

Meet Mireidys Born in Cuba and raised in Miami, FL, within close distance of the sea, 
Mireidys aims to mimic that familiar fluidity of the ocean in her work while 
also capturing the sudden rupture of a wave. A writer of fiction, 
memoir, and poetry, she often plays with combining genres and 
incorporating visual, media, or sculptural elements into her work. 
Mireidys is also a bookbinder, aspiring publisher, and overall 
literature enthusiast. Her author website is www.mybefore.com/mireidysgarcia.A political poet, Mireidys is the author of Letter to the Immigrant's Child, an interdisciplinary writing and book arts project exploring the multifaceted identities of young adults living
 in-between cultures.  LTTIC comes alive in five poetry collections, five artist’s books, and a critical 
introduction on the process. During the making of this project she served as the researcher, writer, copyeditor, layout and graphic 
designer(s), publisher, book construction crew, illustrator (partially),
 and advertiser. Letter to the Immigrant's Child has won Commitee's Pick in BookBuilders of Boston's 58th New England Book Show. Letter to the Immigrant’s Child was nominated
 for the Massachusetts Poetry Festival in May 2014 where she participated 
in a reading and Q & A as part of a panel of young poets addressing 
issues of identity. A copy of Letter to the Immigrant's Child was purchased by the Benson Latin American Collection at the University of Texas and by the Harold F. Johnson library at Hampshire College.

Identifying the triggering infection can get you to the right treatment.""</b></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Times have changed. Mental health disorders traditionally “managed” through medication, therapy and special services are now thought by many credible scientists, researchers and doctors to be triggered by either a virus or a bacteria. Studies have shown that regardless of age of onset or how long the disorder has been active, knowing what may have triggered the symptoms and then treating any underlying cause, is critical to “recovering” one's mental health.</span></p>
<p>Unfortunately, no matter the research, no matter the papers, no matter the guidance from institutions such Yale, Harvard, Stanford and the National Institute of Mental Health, many doctors are not up to speed with current thinking, current testing and current treatments. Sadly, they are either completely uninformed or misunderstand what is happening to their patients. Their patients continue to suffer, often without ever knowing there could be something else wrong, something treatable, causing them or someone they love to suffer from mental health issues.</p>
<p>Our company is closely aligned with a non-profit organization that has been working to educate the medical community, schools and clergy about infection-triggered mental disorders since 2005 when three of the founder’s children became suddenly mentally ill. It turned out that the culprit, in their cases, was a common strep infection, not OCD, TICS, ADHD, Oppositional Defiance Disorder or Bipolarity, as the highly respected specialists at the time diagnosed. Once their mother's finally figured out what was really wrong, because they pushed for testing and were lucky enough to get it, all the children were treated for their underlying conditions, and in their cases, all three children returned to good mental and physical health. </p>
<p>While the non-profit organization has done  good work, it has become clear that they can not get the word out fast enough to really make the giant dent necessary to help people figure out what may be causing their symptoms. Getting doctors to order the necessary blood work has proven difficult in part, because most doctors do not know what to order. Even if a doctor orders the right tests, getting them to understand what they are looking at and why the results may be pointing to an underlying cause for their patient's symptoms is even more difficult.</p>
<p>This is where ThinkInfection.com comes in (A project of The Think People, LLC). We have decided to take the almost impossible step that most people have convincing their primary doctors to order lab tests to determine if their mental health issue may be caused by an infection and provide those lab test orders directly to the patient.</p>
<p>We have also decided to take comprehensive histories from patients so that not only do we make sure that our doctors are ordering the right tests, but also so that we can gather data about what symptoms match what blood results for the general population. This will then allow us to provide the patient with their results as well as how those results may correlate with their symptoms.  In mass, this data (with no names or identifying information, following all HIPAA laws and strictly with the patient's permission) may be a critical component in future treatments and cures. Our hope and belief is that this information will help establish a way for doctors, in the future, to prevent mental disorders from ever taking hold in a person. </p>
<p><b>**********As a side note, recent studies have shown that  many autoimmune illnesses such as Multiple Sclerosis, Parkinson's Disease, Autoimmune Encephalitis etc. may have been triggered by an infection or make a person more likely to suffer from ongoing co-infections as a result of a weakened immune system. As we grow, we hope to add blood tests that will help identify these triggering and co-infections as well, so that other avenues of treatment may be possible for patients suffering with an autoimmune illness. </b></p>
<p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>We are beginning our campaign by raising $20,000. These funds will allow us to complete our site, allow our team of doctors to develop a comprehensive health history questionnaire  and train and ready a small staff that will be there to answer questions and administer lab orders. With this initial amount, we will be able to accommodate 441  patients, providing them with lab orders and test results along with general guidelines for understanding those results. </p>
<p>Please be aware, the $68 cost of our service only covers our ability to review your health questionnaire, provide you with a written prescription for the appropriate blood tests and return to you your blood test results along with general information written guidelines explaining your results. Once we send you the prescription for the blood tests, the costs of the blood tests themselves will either be covered by your insurance company and the approved laboratories under your plan, or you have the option to take the prescription to any local lab that is able to run the test at your own out of pocket expense. Again, to be clear, our fee only covers the our <b><i>review</i></b> of your health questionnaire, a <b><i>prescription</i></b> for appropriate lab tests, your <b><i>results </i></b>and <b><i>general information </i></b><i><b>written guidelines</b></i> explaining how you and your doctor may interpret your results, <b><i>not</i></b>  the cost of the tests themselves and <b><i>not</i></b> an individualized result report. </p>
<p>Coverage by your insurance for the cost of the actual tests will depend on your own policy. After you have signed up and completed the health history questionnaire, if requested, we will gladly provide you with a list of the blood work that will be ordered on the lab slip, so that you can contact your insurance company and make sure you have coverage for those tests and so that you can find out which labratory your insurance requires you to use.  You may also want to contact your lab of choice to determine if they will be able to perform all of the tests in their facility or if you will have to go to another lab to complete the order. </p>
<p>If<span> you decide, for whatever reason, that you do not wish to use our service after all, just let us know <b><i>prior</i></b> to our issuing you your prescription and we will gladly refund your payment in full. You are then welcome to take the list of tests with you to your own doctor for further discussion. </span></p>
<p>We are planning to continue our campaign through Indiegogo's ""in demand"" program so that we will keep growing as more and more people become aware that we are providing these services. As time goes on we hope to expand our services to include direct doctor/patient consultations to people who wish to work with one of our specialists. For now, we will do our best to provide patients with documented lab results that they can take to their own doctors or to a doctor referred by several organizations that are online providing patient information and referrals. </p>
<p>If we do not reach our initial goal in full at the end of this initial 60 day campaign, we will use what funds we have to work with our doctors to complete our comprehensive health history questionnaire, and then we will make sure that those people who have paid for our services receive appropriate prescriptions for lab tests. At that point we will continue with our ongoing campaign to provide much needed lab test orders to individuals needing answers and we will work to complete our site.</p>
<p>Our ""Perks"" are set up based on future services rendered. If you are just a good person who wants to support us and our mission, you can ""donate"" your perk (see the Perk section) to someone in need. Once we launch, we will maintain a fund for people who tell us they can't afford our help. If the funds are there, we will use them. If not, people can choose to be on our waiting list and as the funds come in we will contact them. It is our ultimate goal to help as many people as we can to uncover what has caused their mental disorder and determine the best way forward to a healthier happier life. </p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>Believe it or not, according to the World Health Organization, there are 450 million people diagnosed with a mental health disorder each and every year. That number is expected to double by 2020.  We believe that as much as 60% of those 450 million people have or had a triggering infection that caused their symptoms. Even if that percentage turns out to be a smaller number of affected people, imagine how many people could be helped if they knew that an infection was causing their disorder. To say knowledge is power in this case is truly an understatement. At the most, this knowledge could save a life, at the least it could make life so much more livable for millions of people and the families and friends and teachers and coworkers who must make it through each day, through all the trials and tribulations that go hand in hand with caring about someone who is suffering with a mental disorder. </p>
<p><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p>Building a website such as ours is often more complicated than you think it is going to be. As you build it, you think of more and more things that will make the site better and that makes its creation more costly. We are working with some fantastic tech developers who are passionate about the topic and have pushed us to lay out the sites features to the best of our ability before they build it. They have agreed to stick with us as we grow and build the site in such a way that we can add new features as needed as cost effectively as possible.</p>
<p>Regulations and laws in each state are different regarding the new field of tele-medicine. Some states require that even though we are only providing prescriptions for lab work we must have a prescribing doctor in that particular state in order to write prescriptions. Other states simply will not allow us to operate. We are members of the Association of Tele-medicine. We are actively keeping tabs of what the new and upcoming laws in each state are. One thing is for sure...the changes will only be in our favor as the demand for services through technology grows. Tele-medicine is here to stay and grow, and so are we. If it turns out that we are unable to provide you with services due to specific state laws, we will provide you with a full refund. </p>
<p><b>Other Ways You Can Help</b></p>
<p>If you believe in what we are doing, but just can't contribute at this time, please pass on our information to all the people you know. We guarantee that there is almost no one you know that does not care about, work with, or is related to someone who is suffering with a mental disorder. Even if you are lucky enough not to need our help personally, they do. Please let them know we are here.</p>

ClownCelulaRoja, es una ONG conformada por artistas profesionales especializados en la metodologia de Clown de Hospital, que nació el 2007 en Chile y desde el 2011 también existe en Ecuador, nuestro objetivo es llevar nuestro programa de Clown de Hospital a niños y adultos hospitalizados para apoyar los procesos emocionales por los que pasan durante su enfermedad y tratamiento. Existen numerosas investigaciones sobre los beneficios que tiene el buen humor y la risa como apoyo de tratamientos médicos y nosotros trabajamos en ello creando un ambiente alegre y estimulante a través del humor, la música, el juego creativo y las relaciones saludables, mejorando su calidad de vida. 
Necesitamos financiar visitas de Clowns de Hospital semanales durante todo el año para llevar alegría a un Hospital de Quito. Los hospitales en Quito no tienen fondos para financiar este tipo de programas pero si muchas ganas de que se puedan realizar en ellos, y hay muchos que están esperando!Para conocer más sobre nosotros visita www.clowncelularoja.com

name is Tom Creaghan and I am asking for support in publishing my book
“Talented Miramichers in the Gilded Age”. It is the story of a successful Irish
family, the Adams, who made it big at home, in Colorado and New York. It covers
the history of each area including the spread of the industrial revolution, the
age of moguls, the gold standard and how the rich got richer. It deals with the
history of Miramichi from the days of timber exporting through the age of wind
and sail, the sawmill age down to the age of pulp mills. Because of the various
connections, it also touches on the history of silver mining in Colorado and
the department store industry in New York, including the “Ladies Mile” shopping
district. The story gives an account of politics from the days of Canadian
Confederation to New York’s Tammany Hall and onto Colorado’s struggle over
bi-metallic currency. The Miramichers in this story were active in each area.</p>

a crowdfunding nevű közgazdasági szupersztáré, amely legalább akkora paradigmaváltást hoz a tartalomgyártásban, mint maga az internet a kommunikációban.



Mi is ezért fordulunk most Hozzátok. 
Azt a 250 embert tervezzük megtalálni egy hónapon belül, akik a szívük egy kis darabját odaadják nekünk, mert megérinti őket mindaz az erőfeszítés, amit eddig tettünk azért, hogy egy álmunk valóra váljon.
Sok kis szívdobbanás sokra megy, sok kis vállveregetés sokra megy, sokszor 10 dollár sokra megy úgy, hogy mindez az egyénnek csekélység, gesztus, biztatás, az adakozás apró öröme - nekünk pedig minden.


A közösségi finanszírozás egyszerre piackutatás és értékesítés.Nincs érdektelen vagy ellopott digitális tartalom. 


Zseniálisan old meg egyszerre egy sor alapvető problémát, melyre eddig külön-külön hasztalanul kerestük a megoldást.
Adódik tehát a kézenfekvő döntés: a mi közösségi finanszírozás alapú projektünk feltőkésítéséhez naná, hogy a közösségi finanszírozás erejét vetjük be.

Mi a hangoskönyvek szerelmesei vagyunk.
""A projekt akkor indult, amikor egy napon azon merengtem a szobámban, hogy az évek során a könyvespolcra összevásárolt könyveim elolvasására talán soha nem lesz időm, miközben havi több ezer km-t vezetek teljes magányban. Nemsokára ezután azon kaptam magam, hogy színészekkel, hangmérnökökkel és programozókkal éppen a könyvpiac felforgatásának alapjait rakjuk le."" Dr. Peter Vaczi
A legnagyobb fejtörést a torrent jelentette és az a frusztráló tény, hogy a világ legnagyobbjai is tehetetlenül állnak a probléma előtt.

""Ami még nem készült el, azt el sem lehet lopni és csak az készül el, ami ki van fizetve! Szederjesre csapkodtam a homlokomat, amikor összeállt a kép a közösségi finanszírozás és a hangoskönyvgyártás vonatkozásában."" Dr. Peter Vaczi

Egy vadonatúj koncepció jelenti a frappáns megoldást a tartalomgyártást aláásó legkomplexebb probléma kiiktatására. A lelkes közönség fogja apránként előre összedobni azt a pénzt, amiből ki lehet fizetni például a profi narrátor tiszteletdíját. Nem nekünk kell törni a fejünket, hogy milyen címeket jelentessünk meg, miből finanszírozzuk a hangoskönyvek elkészítését és hogyan akadályozzuk meg a tartalmak tömeges ellopkodását.
Most először a közösséghez fordulunk. Azokból az emberekből építünk bázist, akik szeretik a hangoskönyveket és akiknek szimpatikus mindaz, amiért dolgozunk.



Ha olvasni nincs is mindig időd,

hallgatni szinte bármikor lehet a könyveket - most már magyarul is!




Visszaadja az eddig értelmetlenül elpazarolt időt, amit autóban ülve vagy házimunkával végzel. Ezentúl keresni fogod az ilyen alkalmakat.
Elérhető lesz idővel mindenféle könyv: szabadidőre, önképzésre, ismeretterjesztésre, a gyerekek lefoglalására.
A külföldön született ifjúság számára segít megőrizni a magyar nyelvet, megismerni a magyar irodalom legjobbjait - a meséktől, az ifjúsági regényeken át a tankönyvekig.


Mindez pofonegyszerűen: netről telefonra, tabletre vagy akár egy pendrive-ra az autóban. Pofátlanul olcsón.
A technológia és az első félszáz mű készen van, elérhető. Viszont minél gyorsabban szeretnénk az elérhető hangoskönyvtárat bővíteni. Ehhez most még szükségünk van vállveregetésedre és némi apróra Tőled. Nyomj egy barackot a fejünkre, vedd elő a hitelkártyád, merengj el mennyi legyen az annyi és küldd a lét! Nem leszünk hálátlanok. Összeraktunk egy kis svédasztalt itt jobbra, ebből lehet szemezgetni, szerintünk hűde korrektre sikerült.
Kérjük, támogass minket, ha szimpatikus számodra törekvésünk. Béta oldalunk még csak a jéghegy csúcsa, fejlesztéseink ott hevernek papíron és tőkeinjekcióra várnak.

Mire is fordítjuk majd a támogatásodat?

Célunk az, hogy be tudjuk fejezni legalapvetőbb fejlesztéseinket, pl. egy olyan adatbáziskezelő szoftvert, amely nem látványos, mert a háttérben fut. Ennek a költsége 2540 dollár, enélkül nem tudunk továbblépni.
Ha nemcsak pár dollárral segítesz, hanem azzal is, hogy megosztod ezt a kampányt másokkal, akik örömmel csatlakoznak hozzánk, akkor előfordulhat, hogy a célösszeg többszöröse is összejön. 20.000 dollárból pl. már le tudjuk programozni tervezett aggregátorunk mobil applikációját.
A továbbiakba egyelőre nem merünk belegondolni.

Mit is kínálunk cserébe támogatásodért?
Olyan viszonzásokat, azaz PERK-eket állítottunk össze, amelyek elegánsan bőkezű ár/érték arányt képviselnek és nem kell lesütnünk a szemünket, amikor átnyújtjuk.

Válassz egy PERK-et!
A választott PERK-nek megfelelő számú VOUCHER korlátlan ideig felhasználható, beváltása akár a tartalombővítés utánra is halasztható.
Regisztrálj honlapunkon, és váltsd be a VOUCHER-eket, vagy tárold el későbbre!
Ha van kedved, iratkozz fel hírlevelünkre, hogy kedvenc könyveid megjelenéséről időben értesülj.




A jövő

Könyv és olvasó - múzeumi fogalmakká halványulnak.
Cím lesz és fogyasztó.

Az irodalomfogyasztó a thevoicean.com aggregátoron kiválasztja a címet (az irodalmi művet) és eldönti, hogy milyen formában óhajtja befogadni. 
Eldönti, hogy ropogós, illatos, nyomtatott formában szeretné a művet vagy zsebrevágja többezer eBook-ja közé. 
Elolvassa vagy éppen meghallgatja, esetleg mindkettő.  
Mi már elkezdtük építeni az aggregátort, melynek részese lehetsz Te magad is. Nemcsak pár dolláros támogatásoddal, hanem azzal, hogy majd szavazol egy hiányzó formátumra. 



Nincs meg kedvenc műved hallgatható formában? 
Nincs belőle eBook? 
Szavazz rá és mi megcsináljuk!",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

The Poetry

ANCESTRAL HOME Eons from life’s birth
the sea still calls us by name.
And we still answer
This and many other poems have been gathered over the course of an incredibly productive year of writing. I’m looking for your help to get this book of poetry published. 


My name is Andrew Furst. I am the self-published author of Western Lights, a meditation teacher, Buddhist blogger, and a technologist. On evenings and weekends, I write at www.andrewfurst.net. 







The Book

What does it mean to be awake? 
What is it like to actually be alive?
The Buddha is the spark of life in each of us. What could be more important than being awake for life?  Nothing brings us back to it more than spending time in nature.
My book titled And We Still Answer, is a collection of poetry exploring the intersection of nature and our humanity. It includes traditional forms like haiku and tanka, free-verse, and others.
I invest time in writing poetry for two reasons 

It pushes me to be fully awake to the emotions and sensations that make me who I am. This helps me be a better human being.
It also invites you, the reader, to find your own awakening. Not by way of any particular wisdom that I have to offer, but by observing the act of someone noticing.


The Campaign

My campaign’s
goal is to raise money to design, edit, and publish my book And We Still Answer.  Self-publishing this book is not about making money, it’s about finding new ways to reach out with the Dharma. Proceeds from sales of the book will be used to provide free meditation classes and other Dharma activities.
Here's the breakout on the costs:

<p>Hi, my name is Graeme Innes, I dedicated the best part of 35 years to environmental well being, protecting sacred sights, supporting land rights for Australia's Aboriginal people, and fostering people's health through facilitating Earth initiation rituals, and now I require your help.</p>
<p> I need to raise $4000 to ensure Platypus Dreaming .. a prophecy can get the promotion it deserves at the International Book Fairs in London, Frankfurt, New York Beijing and Guadeloupe (Mexico),  encouraging people around the world to follow in  the foot steps of Australia's indigenous people, promoting peace by integrating this more logical AND intuitive way of being.</p>
<p>Life isn't meant to be lived as an either/or scenario, but by integrating intelligence that's rooted in the fullness of sustainable (in) formation.<br/></p>
<p>Devoting much energy over years sharing the things I've learned, including facilitating overnight earth burial initiations to promote the growth of moral excellence and resilience within individuals and in society. I've undertaken the work believing environmental and community well-being to be the birthright of all species, without thinking about the need for creating a bank balance.<br/></p>
<p> Platypus Dreaming is racy, insightful, provocative, passionate and deep, infusing the mind with a new way of
“seeing”, promoting peace and right relationship through the use of a profusion
of images too powerful to be easily dismissed.</p>
<p>I wish I could lay claim to its content, but it's been the result of product self-assembly, functioning rather like a 3D Printer whose program was laid down in my mind through experiences encountered during life lived beyond the bounds of 'good little boy' white fella conditioning.<br/></p>
<p>In the quiet of the Central
Australian bush there are people able to rely upon one another's senses as
though their own; intelligence magnified not only by the human group, but by
their animal, plant and ‘country’ co-inhabitants as equal informants.</p>
<p>Remote dwelling Aboriginals exhibit
a coherent collective intelligence, which in towns and cities gets drowned out by
the exponentially exploding babble of enfeebling trinkets, making the populace
more and more reliant on crutches of convenience which everyone apparently ‘needs’.</p>
<p>Ancient understandings lie at the heart of
Platypus Dreaming, depicting a peaceful yet radical departure
from humanity’s current role in life, having dominion over, rather than living in the Dominion of God.</p>
<p>It exemplifies a way of Being that opens a
path to world peace, using keys hidden in plain sight, keys to end environmental
degradation and foster new understandings that establish balanced, gender
based cultural architecture, in accordance with clear principles of creation. <br/></p>
<p>These were expressed following
a casual question to Senior Lore men and women from the Warlpiri culture in
Australia’s Tanami Desert.</p>
<p>“What's the point of relationship
between you mob and us white-fellas, given that you no-longer regard us as the
‘white ghosts’ of your forefathers returning”, the literal meaning of Kardia,
which was the name they used to signify their relationship to the first
European colonists.</p>
<p>""I dunn-know. Never thought about that one question. Can't answer him"". I left the community none the wiser.<br/></p>
<p>“Jappanangka, Jappanangka”, the
voice of an old man insistently called as I wandered along a path 1,000
kilometres distant and two and a half years later. I ignored him, after all,
one in eight Warlpiri men were of the Jappanangka ‘skin’. He kept calling until
finally I turned.</p>
<p>“Yeah you, Jappanangka. Remember
that one big question you asked me.....well just after you left us mob,we got
him television. All the old people talked for months and months, maybe one
year, ‘bout that one question you asked. That television, he carry two pattern.
One big one of mobs of people like yous, and one small one of mobs like us, everyone
dying slow way.Then we understand why our parents teached us that we wuz at the
end of The Dreaming, coz we only had
half a system, that female circle part. You mob, you’ve only
got the male side. <br/></p>
<p>None of us got future without everything being in proper
balance. It’s same way in all nature. To make him right decision, gotta have full circle of (in) formation, then him show proper which way, not just man side or woman side”.</p>
<p>Empowered
through fortuitous connections and years of work seeking the ‘right words’ to
forge cerebral switches to illuminate long hidden mind-paths, this book has
also been built on the unwitting participation of many people living in the
Rainbow Region of northern New South Wales. <br/></p>
<p>While many there already comprehend
life’s indivisibility and recognize that its component reflections carry differing
attributes, enhanced by location and exposure to readily available educative
nutrients, many others do not.</p>
<p>In order
to show the contemporary relevance and utility of that ‘way of seeing’, and
avoid being regarded as some sort of Aboriginal cultural specialist, this novel
was deliberately set in a ‘white fella’ setting.</p>
<p>My early questioning
of life lacked adequate appreciation and inquiry for skills in material financial
generation and management, attributes I now require to bring this project to
fruition, propelling it onto the world stage of International Book Fairs that
are held in London, New York, Frankfurt, Beijing and Guadeloupe (Mexico). </p>
<p>Raised to respond to the power of
intelligence and information for the betterment of all, clear links to
environment and life soon became unavoidably apparent, yet it still appeared as though
most people willingly accepted the notion of separation and isolation, cut off
from one another by the use of split moralities, leading to acceptance of
bullying and violence, afflictions many Aboriginal people have adopted as their
cultural integrity has been abused.</p>
<p>As I
traveled internationally, conflict was in broad evidence there also,
often fostered by ‘authorities’ to their personal and cultural advantage. They
show little regard for the misery, destruction and chaos split moralities
engender, and it became my mission to look behind the veil, finding points of
connection with them to create possible pathways for change.</p>
<p>Through
involvement in environmental actions, protecting rainforest and cultural sites
of tribal and world significance, I came to see I was composed of all life’s
parts. There was no thing that hadn’t somehow infused my body with its juices
and substance. Everything that’s (in) formed by light, provides our information
and isn’t just unreliable infirm ation like so much media noise.</p>
<p>Platypus Dreaming .. a prophecy is the
result of an endeavor to place the reader inside that understanding, to
realize the true vastness, the spaciousness and the accessibility of informed
intelligence, and give it wings, allowing people to recognize it as theirs,

their hands, arms, legs, feet, torsos and heads all appear to live in different cultures,
they do so without an internal battle for parts domination. </p>

<h3>We need a Champion</h3> <p>Like so many people of color I was struck deep in my soul by the incredibly outsized worlds of fantasy, sci-fi, heroes and villains.  I honestly cannot remember when I did not like stories about space, or hobbits, or caped crusaders and big blue boy scouts. </p>
<p>I lived for comics, I loved the TV serials, I jumped for the heroes on the big screen.  After the movies Star Wars and Superman my perspective on the world was set, I really did believe a man could fly.  But still, when it came to reading the written word, I was even more intrigued by the universes MY mind created from the magic of the author's words.   </p>
<p>But the question was always, where was I?  Where are the people who look like me?  Are we not heroes? Do we not exist in the future?  Can I read and enjoy something that mirrors the world I see in my mind's eye with my experiences and desires outside of the usual stereotypes?  With this question I knew then, there was some magic in me, magic I truly wanted to share. </p>
<p>Over the decades we have seen heroes of color appear.  Starship captains,  aliens, web-slingers, war-machines, a man of steel, and perhaps my favorite, a hero genius Prince come King of a mighty nation called Wakanda. I wasn't sure I could add to what was already so wonderful, and happily growing.  But then, I had to remind myself of what I tell others, we each have a story to tell.  If we have the gift to breathe life into what we see in our mind's eye, then we should endeavor to do so. However, few are those that can create something worthy on their own.  I am not one of those, I need your support.  </p>

I lived for comics, I loved the TV serials, I jumped for the heroes on the big screen.  After the movies Star Wars and Superman my perspective on the world was set, I really did believe a man could fly.  But still, when it came to reading the written word, I was even more intrigued by the universes MY mind created from the magic of the author's words.   
But the question was always, where was I?  Where are the people who look like me?  Are we not heroes? Do we not exist in the future?  Can I read and enjoy something that mirrors the world I see in my mind's eye with my experiences and desires outside of the usual stereotypes?  With this question I knew then, there was some magic in me, magic I truly wanted to share. 
Over the decades we have seen heroes of color appear.  Starship captains,  aliens, web-slingers, war-machines, a man of steel, and perhaps my favorite, a hero genius Prince come King of a mighty nation called Wakanda. I wasn't sure I could add to what was already so wonderful, and happily growing.  But then, I had to remind myself of what I tell others, we each have a story to tell.  If we have the gift to breathe life into what we see in our mind's eye, then we should endeavor to do so. However, few are those that can create something worthy on their own.  I am not one of those, I need your support.  


In the full darkness of the Great Gulf between Galaxies a
presence stirs, something that has not been seen for an age.  Its disruptive entrance into our reality does
not go unnoticed.  In the Majestic Galaxy
sentients observe this event, powers are alerted, and great fleets are on the
move.  
Two forces in this far off galaxy fight for control, waging
war on a horrifying scale.  The
appearance of this presence, The Kha’ahmpion, can tilt the scales of this

<h1 style=""text-align: center;"">Summary</h1>Indie Quill is an online book marketplace specifically for small presses and self-publishers. Smartly tailored to the special needs of this group (as well as for readers who love discovering new worlds to inhabit), Indie Quill is poised to be the next step in the self-publishing world. Our aim is to increase the quality, diversity, and discoverability of independent books by creating a centralized home online to buy, sell, and discover works. <br/><br/>Self publishers in particular have historically faced major hurdles to sustainable self-employment through writing because of lack of distribution, an unfair playing field online, and exploitation by unscrupulous providers.  We look to increase sales for authors by giving authors and readers better products, tools, and quality standards.  But we need your help getting off the ground!  <br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448591662/eb89wuczc2ow5x3tundd.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h1 style=""text-align: center;"">The Backstory<br/>
</h1>
<p>""Everyone has a story to tell, and it's my job to help you tell it better."" <br/><br/>That is the motto Founder and CEO Thalia Sutton uses while working as an editor, and it's a rare idea in the publishing world. Disenfranchised with the elitism found in the publishing industry and the writing schools that feed it, when Thalia graduated from Columbia University in 2012, she decided to put herself to work where she felt her skills were needed most: being a freelance editor for self publishers.<br/><br/>Over the years, she found a great diversity of authors and stories, but a lack of resources for them.  Yet people's goals, and troubles, were often the same. She was shocked to hear, time and again, these main troubles from the authors she served: <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448762776/aohljxbgrrzsux2i3q5w.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p>No one should ever feel like quitting something they love because the system is inefficient. Thalia waited for a website to address the needs of her clients, but over time, the issues actually got worse.  More companies hopped on the bandwagon to exploit uneducated author hopefuls, rather than giving them the resources they actually needed.  <br/></p>So Thalia came to the conclusion that, while the publishing industry works well for some, there are many good books and valuable stories that don't get seen, which is a shame.  There were thousands of books that should have been thriving in the self-published market based on what people wanted to read.  But they weren't.  And why?  Because the people who cared didn't have the means, and the people with the means didn't care.  <br/><br/>Because no one felt the art of the common man had value.<br/><br/><p>So she decided: <i>I'll make a marketplace specifically for you.</i><br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<h1 style=""text-align: center;"">Plot Twist</h1>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">(How We're Different)</h3>
<h4>1. Outlook<br/>
</h4>
<p>We're book people, innovating a home for each other--we want to help you achieve your goals of making a living off of your art and, as a reader, a better book to read.  We believe in good customer service and also that you're the one that knows your book, and your reading habits, best.  It's like being in your local bookstore, but with ""local writers"" from all across the country.<br/>
</p>
<h4>2. Tools &amp; Platform<br/>
</h4>
<p>Indie Quill wants to be the best place out there for selling indie books, so we take the best of what's out there, put it together in one place, and innovate on top of it. Author shops help sellers' works be collected easily in one place, so if you like an author or company, you can browse their book series quickly and efficiently.  Shops also have locations attached, so buyers can support local while online.<br/></p>
<p>Our search engine uses over 15 criteria, not just a few keywords, to bring up books, so books get seen more often.  Smart and fun filters help readers pick books by mood and taste and reading level, while a graphics-based layout (rather than text-based) lets you browse by covers, which is both entertaining and slows search-fatigue. A pop-out feature also assists in this, giving you the product at a glance.  Meanwhile, you can thumb through a few pages and learn more about the book and author on each product's detailed listing page.  While you're there, hand-crafted recommendations give you truly relevant subsequent reading material, keeping you from getting cliff notes and second editions as recs.<br/></p>
<p>In later stages of development, we want to integrate Goodreads and innovate sharing and discussion of books as well so that each book gets all the love and support it deserves. For authors, we look to provide high-quality reader circles of other authors for feedback support.<br/></p>
<h4>3. Empowerment &amp; Diversity<br/>
</h4>
<p>Indie Quill also believes that reading is a means to empowerment, and as such, every group should be represented. Special interest groups and ""rare"" forms of literature that we want to make sure have a home (and a search criteria) include:</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448762393/uggcrahtkz8yyraflmlw.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<h4>4. Ethics</h4>Your bookstore shouldn't be your publisher. Indie Quill will never publish books; we only offer you place to sell them.  This is because we care about doing one thing and doing it well. <br/><br/>There are many sites today that offer a place to sell self-published books, but in every case they also publish them, which crosses a long-standing ethical boundary that any scrupulous publishing professional knows is there for a good reason.  Simply put, if you both sell and publish books, you are not focused on either one, and everyone loses out because of a glut of bad books.  It becomes a business model based on how many units you can process, not how many return customers you have.  On the other hand, if you do one or the other with proper standards, you can make plenty of money.  Anyone who does both is not looking out for their authors' best interest. <br/><br/>
</div> <div> <h1 style=""text-align: center;"">The Crisis Point<br/>
</h1>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">(What We Need)<br/>
</h3> <h4>Baseline Goal:</h4>
<ul><li>$20,000 for initial website construction with its basic foundation of features.  Our website is being designed, tested, and implemented by the wonderful team at Fusionfarm, a division of The Gazette Company.  You can check out their portfolio at <a href=""http://fusionfarm.com/clients/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">their website. </a>
</li></ul>
<h4>$20,000 gets us:</h4>
<h4>
</h4>
<ol>
<li>The base website with all its necessary features, and a few special ones<br/>
</li>
<li>Testing, for a smooth website experience without bugs!</li>
</ol>
<h4>Stretch Goals:<br/>
</h4>
<ul>
<li>$25,000 - Cover unforeseen costs in web development, and pay an accountant to help us navigate sales tax in all fifty states and beyond.<br/>
</li>
<li>$30,000 - Help us get to our first trade shows and have the equipment necessary to sign people up on-site!</li>
<li>$40,000 - Hire our first extra staff to quality-check books and perform speedy customer service, as well as cover operating costs for the first year!<br/>
</li>
</ul>
</div> <div> <h1 style=""text-align: center;""><br/></h1>
<h1 style=""text-align: center;"">Rising Action</h1>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">(Impact)<br/>
</h3> <p>We're positioned to be the next step in the self-publishing revolution, the capstone of the drive for quality and community that's been building in the indie author industry for past decade.  But more than that, we want to change how the game is played: We want to level the playing field, and make treating authors well the name of the game...as well as treating readers like the intelligent consumers they are.</p>
<p>But more importantly, <b>Indie Quill's greatest potential lies in diversity.</b> Most good books go unpublished, or under marketed, because companies don't think they can make their money back on the project--not because there is anything wrong with the book.  This leaves minorities, women, foreign works, avant-garde works, and forms of literature with small markets (such as poetry) underrepresented or not represented at all.</p>
<p>Take, for example, the sci fi genre.  As popular as it is, there are only one or two authors of color in the genre that even die-hard fans can name, and just as few characters of color who lead the stories themselves.  If Indie Quill can get just two authors of color on our site selling books, we've double what's available to a kid in the Bronx who goes to his local bookstore (if he even has one).  <br/></p>
<p>Too, along with bringing national, and international, reach to authors, we bring a wonderful variety of books and author resources to people who live in small towns that may not have independent bookstores.  A nifty perk of Indie Quill is that author ""shops"" can have locations attached, so event organizers can easily search for authors in their area to bring to libraries, schools, festivals, and other events.<br/></p>
<p>Aside from diversity of authors and stories, Indie Quill is also positioned, with your help, to assist many authors achieve their dream of making a living off of their writing, in a way that hasn't been widely accessible before to self-publishers.  We hope this will help many small businesses, career writers, women writers, and minority writers achieve financial stability.<br/></p>
<p>Our aim is that all of the above finally get the robust national reach and recognition they deserve for pushing boundaries with works larger publishing houses have passed by.</p>

<h4>Q: <i>Tell me about this ""vetting"" process</i>
</h4>
<p></p>
<h3></h3>
<p>A:
 At Indie Quill, we will quality-check books before they go live on the site (as pioneered by that comics-selling website that has an X in its name), to produce, in a sense, ""curated content"" such that you get a decent book no matter what you buy.  <br/></p>
<p>But, rest assured that quality-checking is the name of the game, not censorship.  The books are evaluated based on industry 
standards: it's been professionally edited for readability and typos, 
the layout is consistent and works on various platforms, the cover is 
professional-looking.  Whether or not your story delivers well on its 
premises is up to the readers to decide!  </p>
<h4>Q: <i>What types of books will be sold on the website?</i>
</h4>
<p>A:
 Indie Quill will be a platform in which you can sell all types of 
books: Physical books, ebooks, and audiobooks.  Sellers will be 
responsible for mailing copies (digital copies can be downloaded from 
the site), which allows us to take a smaller commission than other sites
 that warehouse the books for you.  At first, only digital book files (E and Audio) will be available, but as we reach stage two, physical books will be available to buy and sell too.  Your donations will help us get there faster!<br/></p>
<p>Similarly, all genres of books
 are welcome!  Seriously, all of them: Got a book on cooking eggs? We'll
 take it.  Got a YA protagonist with egg-related magic powers?  We'll 
take that too.  Maybe a romance about a chicken farmer?  That's good 
too.  <br/></p>
<p>Extra points for books that censors might like to ban some day.</p>
<h4>Q: <i>What languages will books be in?</i>
</h4>
<p>The
 Indie Quill site will be in English at first, but you are welcome to 
sell books that are in any language--in fact, we encourage it!</p>
<h4>Q: <i>I work for a small press. I'm interested in getting our list on this site. </i>
</h4>
<p>Great!
 We're looking for early adopters as well as beta testers to give us 
feedback as we develop the site.  Our goal, in fact, is to get every small press in the US on the site.  If you'd like any part of that, just 
send an email to founder@indiequill.com.</p>
<h4>Q: <i>I have a manuscript to edit that's a lot longer than the perks offer.</i>
</h4>
<p>That's okay! Message us and we can work something out at the rate described in the perks.  IndieGogo limits the number of rewards visible at one time, so we tried to pick the sizes most likely to fit the greatest number of people.<br/></p>

Smartly tailored to the special needs of this group (as well as for readers who love discovering new worlds to inhabit), Indie Quill is poised to be the next step in the self-publishing world. Our aim is to increase the quality, diversity, and discoverability of independent books by creating a centralized home online to buy, sell, and discover works. Self publishers in particular have historically faced major hurdles to sustainable self-employment through writing because of lack of distribution, an unfair playing field online, and exploitation by unscrupulous providers.  We look to increase sales for authors by giving authors and readers better products, tools, and quality standards.  But we need your help getting off the ground!  
The Backstory

""Everyone has a story to tell, and it's my job to help you tell it better."" That is the motto Founder and CEO Thalia Sutton uses while working as an editor, and it's a rare idea in the publishing world. Disenfranchised with the elitism found in the publishing industry and the writing schools that feed it, when Thalia graduated from Columbia University in 2012, she decided to put herself to work where she felt her skills were needed most: being a freelance editor for self publishers.Over the years, she found a great diversity of authors and stories, but a lack of resources for them.  Yet people's goals, and troubles, were often the same. She was shocked to hear, time and again, these main troubles from the authors she served: 




No one should ever feel like quitting something they love because the system is inefficient. Thalia waited for a website to address the needs of her clients, but over time, the issues actually got worse.  More companies hopped on the bandwagon to exploit uneducated author hopefuls, rather than giving them the resources they actually needed.  So Thalia came to the conclusion that, while the publishing industry works well for some, there are many good books and valuable stories that don't get seen, which is a shame.  There were thousands of books that should have been thriving in the self-published market based on what people wanted to read.  But they weren't.  And why?  Because the people who cared didn't have the means, and the people with the means didn't care.  Because no one felt the art of the common man had value.So she decided: I'll make a marketplace specifically for you.

Plot Twist
(How We're Different)
1. Outlook

We're book people, innovating a home for each other--we want to help you achieve your goals of making a living off of your art and, as a reader, a better book to read.  We believe in good customer service and also that you're the one that knows your book, and your reading habits, best.  It's like being in your local bookstore, but with ""local writers"" from all across the country.

2. Tools & Platform

Indie Quill wants to be the best place out there for selling indie books, so we take the best of what's out there, put it together in one place, and innovate on top of it. Author shops help sellers' works be collected easily in one place, so if you like an author or company, you can browse their book series quickly and efficiently.  Shops also have locations attached, so buyers can support local while online.
Our search engine uses over 15 criteria, not just a few keywords, to bring up books, so books get seen more often.  Smart and fun filters help readers pick books by mood and taste and reading level, while a graphics-based layout (rather than text-based) lets you browse by covers, which is both entertaining and slows search-fatigue. A pop-out feature also assists in this, giving you the product at a glance.  Meanwhile, you can thumb through a few pages and learn more about the book and author on each product's detailed listing page.  While you're there, hand-crafted recommendations give you truly relevant subsequent reading material, keeping you from getting cliff notes and second editions as recs.
In later stages of development, we want to integrate Goodreads and innovate sharing and discussion of books as well so that each book gets all the love and support it deserves. For authors, we look to provide high-quality reader circles of other authors for feedback support.
3. Empowerment & Diversity

Indie Quill also believes that reading is a means to empowerment, and as such, every group should be represented. Special interest groups and ""rare"" forms of literature that we want to make sure have a home (and a search criteria) include:




4. EthicsYour bookstore shouldn't be your publisher. Indie Quill will never publish books; we only offer you place to sell them.  This is because we care about doing one thing and doing it well. There are many sites today that offer a place to sell self-published books, but in every case they also publish them, which crosses a long-standing ethical boundary that any scrupulous publishing professional knows is there for a good reason.  Simply put, if you both sell and publish books, you are not focused on either one, and everyone loses out because of a glut of bad books.  It becomes a business model based on how many units you can process, not how many return customers you have.  On the other hand, if you do one or the other with proper standards, you can make plenty of money.  Anyone who does both is not looking out for their authors' best interest. 
  The Crisis Point

(What We Need)
 Baseline Goal:
$20,000 for initial website construction with its basic foundation of features.  Our website is being designed, tested, and implemented by the wonderful team at Fusionfarm, a division of The Gazette Company.  You can check out their portfolio at their website. 

$20,000 gets us:



The base website with all its necessary features, and a few special ones

Testing, for a smooth website experience without bugs!

Stretch Goals:


$25,000 - Cover unforeseen costs in web development, and pay an accountant to help us navigate sales tax in all fifty states and beyond.

$30,000 - Help us get to our first trade shows and have the equipment necessary to sign people up on-site!
$40,000 - Hire our first extra staff to quality-check books and perform speedy customer service, as well as cover operating costs for the first year!


  
Rising Action
(Impact)
 We're positioned to be the next step in the self-publishing revolution, the capstone of the drive for quality and community that's been building in the indie author industry for past decade.  But more than that, we want to change how the game is played: We want to level the playing field, and make treating authors well the name of the game...as well as treating readers like the intelligent consumers they are.
But more importantly, Indie Quill's greatest potential lies in diversity. Most good books go unpublished, or under marketed, because companies don't think they can make their money back on the project--not because there is anything wrong with the book.  This leaves minorities, women, foreign works, avant-garde works, and forms of literature with small markets (such as poetry) underrepresented or not represented at all.
Take, for example, the sci fi genre.  As popular as it is, there are only one or two authors of color in the genre that even die-hard fans can name, and just as few characters of color who lead the stories themselves.  If Indie Quill can get just two authors of color on our site selling books, we've double what's available to a kid in the Bronx who goes to his local bookstore (if he even has one).  
Too, along with bringing national, and international, reach to authors, we bring a wonderful variety of books and author resources to people who live in small towns that may not have independent bookstores.  A nifty perk of Indie Quill is that author ""shops"" can have locations attached, so event organizers can easily search for authors in their area to bring to libraries, schools, festivals, and other events.
Aside from diversity of authors and stories, Indie Quill is also positioned, with your help, to assist many authors achieve their dream of making a living off of their writing, in a way that hasn't been widely accessible before to self-publishers.  We hope this will help many small businesses, career writers, women writers, and minority writers achieve financial stability.
Our aim is that all of the above finally get the robust national reach and recognition they deserve for pushing boundaries with works larger publishing houses have passed by.


Rewards
(Rewards!)


We have a lot of really cool rewards for you, including editorial services and snazzy merchandise goodies, though you can donate any amount of money without a reward attached. However, our dear friends at Out of Print Clothing--a Brooklyn, NY-based startup that uses out-of-print classic book covers on clothing and accessories--generously offered many of their best-selling products to the Indie Quill cause.  Like IQ, Out of Print believes in furthering the cause of reading to those who would otherwise not have access, and donates a book to Books for Africa for every item they sell. We are very grateful to have their help, and you should check them out after you're done visiting us today.


New rewards will be added as others sell out.
There is a shipping fee for physical rewards, but it's generally $5 
or less if you're in North America.  Please check for the specific 
amount when picking a reward.

We will make every effort to ship rewards such that they arrive for the holidays. If
 you would prefer expedited shipping, please message us and we can 
discuss expedited shipping options and their associated cost.
In an effort to stay green, your materials may be shipped in 
recycled/reused packaging materials--but never fear, they shall still

I could not find one wholesome, family oriented, Christian book in this list, and strongly believe this is a very sad reality.     Have you ever wanted to see a change, only to wait for someone else to come and effect the change you want to see? What if you got an opportunity to be the change you want to see?     You see, I am a story teller. One of my novels on amazon “Chloe” has won gold in competitions, and presently have over 12 5-star reviews. I am thinking that if I did it once, I must be able to do it again. So I have another book “Beyond Time – Journey Through Hell” with my publisher that is coming out this year.      I have been writing plays and movie scripts for over a decade now. I started writing plays in 2002, and have never looked back. Surprisingly, I have over 100 full length plays on my website (www.christianplaywright.org)      The Lord told me to write a novelette from each play, and publish it. I felt this strongly, and also knew it would be impossible, but it is just like Him to suggest such a thing (God of the impossible).      This is where you come in (I hope). Without a community like this, I know in my heart that what I desire would not even be possible.   I want to share one recent review with you.

I have just started my 6th year as a resident musician in the SICU.</span></p><p>Now, here is why I'm doing a crowdfunding campaign:</p><p>A year ago I received the first installment of a book advance from my publisher. As it turned out, I needed an extension of the manuscript deadline from September 2014 to May 2015. The money from that first installment, to pay our living expenses, has been spent and the next installment won't come until late May or June.</p><p>I needed the extension because my publisher had the keen insight that the book needed to be more than just a personal memoir - that the <i>science</i> of music and medicine had to underscore the book's anecdotal stories about what I have experienced and learned over these years as a patient and then as a musician - stories ranging from joyous to heartbreaking. I needed to include leading experts from the fields of music therapy, medicine, neuroscience, and other related areas.<br/></p><p>(See the Addendum at the bottom of this page for a list of the experts who will appear in the book.) </p><p>It took a LOT of time and effort to follow up on this as one thing led to another, all very interesting and valuable but also <i>very very</i> time consuming! </p><p>Furthermore, I had brought in my own editor, paid for from my advance. However, her commitment to the book was based on the original deadline and she was unable to continue beyond that because of other book committments.<br/></p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Wendy had extensive editing experience before she became a singer-guitarist and was an English major at Princeton to boot. Having recently completed producing a documentary film <a href=""http://www.agiftoffire.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.agiftoffire.com</a> with the aforementioned director Steve Yeager, she was able to step in as my book editor and keep the project going. Wendy also began to coordinate all the science research. (Yes, we are husband and wife and work well together. Another miracle.) </p><p>We have just had a lucky break; last week author/editor <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1032816.Lindsey_Tate"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Lindsey Tate </a>took over as the new editor of the book. Lindsey recently co-authored this wonderful book -  <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13203056-shouting-in-the-dark"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Shouting in the Dark: My Journey Back to the Light</a> and she felt a connection between John Bramblitt's story and mine. We are very fortunate to have her on board.</p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">A big part of what has subsidized the writing of this book this past year has been a three-night a week solo guitar gig I had for the last two years on New York's Upper West Side. That ended in November when they lost their lease. Because of that and the total committment required by both of us during this final stretch, this crowdfunding campaign will enable us to pay our living expenses until the manuscript is completed and submitted on May 1st. The second installment of the book advance will arrive some time in late May or June. </span></p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">(I continue to play as a volunteer twice a week in the SICU, cutting back a day because of the book, and will return to three times a week when the manuscript is completed.)</span></p><p>Everyone involved with this book is very excited about its potential to reach a large audience and contribute significantly to the rapidly growing field of Music and Medicine, which is growing by leaps and bounds throughout the world every year, by providing concrete evidence of something that most of us know intuitively and from personal experience - that music can reach into the soul and bring hope and healing during the most trying times of our lives, even in the setting of an intensive care unit. </p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">We thank you in advance and GREATLY appreciate your contribution, and also for sharing this Indiegogo campaign with anyone you think may be interested - through word of mouth, email, or social media.</span></p><p>Warm regards,</p><p>Andrew and Wendy</p><p>Addendum:</p><p>I am honored to include these experts in Music and Medicine in the book. I believe the reader will be fascinated by the brilliant insights from these extraordinarily gifted and accomplished people. </p><ul>

""Nothing activates the brain so much as music"" - Dr. Oliver Sacks, internationally acclaimed neurologist and author. This quote is at the heart of the book I'm writing, literally and figuratively.My name is Andrew Schulman. I'm a professional musician, a classical guitarist, based in New York City since 1975: http://www.abacaproductions.comThis fundraising campaign is for a book I've been writing for the past year called:       Waking The Spirit: A Musician's Journey Healing Body, Mind, and SoulMy publisher is Picador, an imprint of Macmillan Publishers. It's due for release in 2016.  http://us.macmillan.com/wakingthespirit/andrewschulmanAll donations are tax-deductible. Steve Yeager, a Sundance Film Festival award winning film director and longtime friend has a Not-for-Profit (501c3) Arts and Education Fund called Bay State Ventures, Inc., and has kindly agreed to be the fiscal sponsor for this campaign.Here are a few things directly related to the story: - The 3-minute video at the top of this page, called The Gift of Healing, won a NY Emmy in 2012 in the Human Interest category for WNBC-TV, and First Prize in the National Press Photographer Association's Best in PhotoJournalism series.  - There has been a lot of media coverage already on my story; I am especially proud to have been part of the superb BBC Radio 4 series called Soul Music. That program can be heard here: Bach's St Matthew Passion  - This is a link to an article I wrote for the November issue of Allegro Magazine, the Musicians Union monthly. (The writing is geared to my fellow musicians but you can get a good overview of the book):http://www.local802afm.org/2014/11/how-to-improve-your-playing - A 30-minute documentary film called ""Andrew & Wendy"", directed and produced by Academy Award nominated Josh Aronson, had its World Premiere at the Rhode Island International Film Festival last August and its New York Premiere at DOC NYC this past November. It has just been accepted for broadcast on Thirteen/WNET,  the PBS-TV outlet in New York, for the Fall of 2015. (We are offering autographed copies of the DVD as one of the Perks.)http://aronsonfilms.com/aw-info.html                                                                               *The book's title reflects the fact that my wife Wendy saved my life in the middle of a six-day coma in July 2009 by playing my favorite music for me via my iPod - Bach's St. Matthew Passion. The music did what modern medicine at its best couldn't - it pulled me back from the precipice by giving me the will to live. (Dr. Marvin McMillen, the Surgical ICU Director, and my surgeon, Dr. Martin Karpeh, Jr., talk about this in the Aronson film and in greater detail in the book.) After my recovery I returned as a volunteer in January 2010 to the same Surgical Intensive Care Unit (SICU) where I had been a patient, playing my guitar three days a week to help other critically ill people. Within a year I became the first Resident Visiting Artist of the world-renowned Louis Armstrong Center for Music and Medicine based at Beth Israel Medical Center (now called Mount Sinai Beth Israel). I have just started my 6th year as a resident musician in the SICU.Now, here is why I'm doing a crowdfunding campaign:A year ago I received the first installment of a book advance from my publisher. As it turned out, I needed an extension of the manuscript deadline from September 2014 to May 2015. The money from that first installment, to pay our living expenses, has been spent and the next installment won't come until late May or June.I needed the extension because my publisher had the keen insight that the book needed to be more than just a personal memoir - that the science of music and medicine had to underscore the book's anecdotal stories about what I have experienced and learned over these years as a patient and then as a musician - stories ranging from joyous to heartbreaking. I needed to include leading experts from the fields of music therapy, medicine, neuroscience, and other related areas.(See the Addendum at the bottom of this page for a list of the experts who will appear in the book.) It took a LOT of time and effort to follow up on this as one thing led to another, all very interesting and valuable but also very very time consuming! Furthermore, I had brought in my own editor, paid for from my advance. However, her commitment to the book was based on the original deadline and she was unable to continue beyond that because of other book committments.Fortunately, Wendy had extensive editing experience before she became a singer-guitarist and was an English major at Princeton to boot. Having recently completed producing a documentary film http://www.agiftoffire.com with the aforementioned director Steve Yeager, she was able to step in as my book editor and keep the project going. Wendy also began to coordinate all the science research. (Yes, we are husband and wife and work well together. Another miracle.) We have just had a lucky break; last week author/editor Lindsey Tate took over as the new editor of the book. Lindsey recently co-authored this wonderful book -  Shouting in the Dark: My Journey Back to the Light and she felt a connection between John Bramblitt's story and mine. We are very fortunate to have her on board.A big part of what has subsidized the writing of this book this past year has been a three-night a week solo guitar gig I had for the last two years on New York's Upper West Side. That ended in November when they lost their lease. Because of that and the total committment required by both of us during this final stretch, this crowdfunding campaign will enable us to pay our living expenses until the manuscript is completed and submitted on May 1st. The second installment of the book advance will arrive some time in late May or June. (I continue to play as a volunteer twice a week in the SICU, cutting back a day because of the book, and will return to three times a week when the manuscript is completed.)Everyone involved with this book is very excited about its potential to reach a large audience and contribute significantly to the rapidly growing field of Music and Medicine, which is growing by leaps and bounds throughout the world every year, by providing concrete evidence of something that most of us know intuitively and from personal experience - that music can reach into the soul and bring hope and healing during the most trying times of our lives, even in the setting of an intensive care unit. We thank you in advance and GREATLY appreciate your contribution, and also for sharing this Indiegogo campaign with anyone you think may be interested - through word of mouth, email, or social media.Warm regards,Andrew and WendyAddendum:I am honored to include these experts in Music and Medicine in the book. I believe the reader will be fascinated by the brilliant insights from these extraordinarily gifted and accomplished people.

<h3>EXCERPT FROM BOOK: <br/>
</h3>
With tears rimming her green eyes, she shared how she spent the last thirty years living a quiet life working as a librarian and married to a controlling man who would never look at her nude body in the light. She chronicled how she went from locked inside herself, ashamed of her body to gaining her independence from her husband and embarking upon a sexual revolution full of passion and self-discovery. <br/><br/>As she spoke of her new boyfriend taking his time in bed, the light on, all hours of the day, touching her, drinking in all that she is with his eyes, her face lit up and she exhaled a long sigh, like she was letting go of something she had been holding on to for three decades. It brought tears to my eyes.<br/><br/><p>Then the tender moment came to a jarring halt and went floppy as she<br/>turned to face me and said, <br/></p>

I couldn’t move.<br/><br/><i>Oh God, no. Please no.

<p>My name is Elle and this is my story…</p>
<p><i>The journey that unfolded in the physical world looks a lot like this:</i></p>
<p>The transformation of <i>myself</i> over the past ten years from an Australian Gold Coast “Barbie
doll”, sixty-something-year-old-widow, living in a gated security complex enclosed
with grills on all the windows and doors and now to a Bohemian Goddess, writer,
artist and spiritual healer-initiator is something my mind could never have
dreamed up in a million years.</p>
<p>To add to the outrageousness of it all, I
have been in an intimate relationship with a beloved for about eight years and
counting. Flying at 35,000ft above sea level, an act of providence sparked this
chance meeting with a slightly-built, long-haired “old soul” - who just happens
to be the same age as my son – a multi-talented “creative machine gun”: artist,
photographer, designer, educator, and an eco-compassion-activist as such. My
life as I knew it turned upside down, inside out, triggering bagsful of emotional
turmoil, eventually resulting in profound deep healing.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1435818677/j53c70sokmjrtvbwr6cp.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><i>And the Inner Journey of awakening and returning to the remembrance of oneself
as Soul is a whole different story. It goes:</i></p>
<p>The magical, mysterious and miraculous
weaving of events that have had me dancing in God’s Grace one moment, then down
on my knees in gut-wrenching agony in another, when ego shows up, is all part
of an exquisite tapestry revealing itself <i>thread
by</i><i> colourful</i><i> thread</i>. </p>
<p>I would love to share the interweaving of
both journeys through my writing. </p>
<p>The serendipitous chain of events that led
me to an ashram in Bali where I lived for seven years in a grass-roofed villa
on the side of a gorge; totally open to the jungle below; the bed netting being
my only security. </p>
<p>Moving to the Philippines in 2013, I call a
tree house home for a period of two months – a far cry from the security grills
and locks I imprisoned myself with in Australia. </p>
<p>Some of these experiences are written as
short blog articles with beautiful photographic images on my web site: <a href=""http://www.elledivine.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.elledivine.com</a>  </p>
<p>With the monsoon season just beginning, I am
making a commitment to fully support the creative muse that is now screaming at
me to write – <i>right, yes, write, write,
write</i>. With the temperature of the air a lot cooler, the overcast sky
gentle on my eyes, and the soothing sound of the rain, I feel the time is ripe
for me to channel through words of wisdom and laughter and joy and sadness and
ecstasy. </p>
<p>The three-month writing residency project, <i>Monsoon Writing</i>, will be self-directed
(with support from fellow writers) and crowd-funded to intensify the motivation
and discipline to focus into writing. </p>
<p>If there is an inquisitiveness arising
within you to know how this journey unfolds and the simple healing techniques I
have acquired to move from fear to love; from darkness to light; from merely
existing in this world to truly living a happy peace filled life, please take a
look at the options available for you to consider in supporting this project.
By doing so you will not only be helping fund the <i>Monsoon Writing Project</i> but energetically you will be supporting
yourself also; your own Soul’s journey to awakening, whatever that is for you. And
that is just how this loving <i>universe</i>
works. </p>

The available energy-exchange or rewards for sponsors will be in the
forms of original artworks; or art greeting cards and a pouch of ""Ancient Wisdom"" inspirational cards designed and handmade in our
studio; or an e-book copy of the completed work. And of course a personal “thank you” note (and a

In September, Tara will be reading her work at the 2015 International Poetry Festival in Sibiu, Romania, as she has done for the past two years. Tara is passionate about language and poetry, as well as sharing her love of these things through teaching.So, let's give Tara the send off she deserves! This is your chance to celebrate both Tara and the work that she loves by helping support her while she's in Romania this year. Tara is leaving her full-time position and apartment in Boston in order to pursue this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. The Fulbright award does provide a modest stipend for her teaching duties, of course, but will not cover all of her expenses for the year or the costs associated with her re-entry back to the U.S. Our aim is to lessen her financial concerns to make sure she can have the most productive and enriching experience in Romania.Any amount you can give will be greatly appreciated, but do consider making a contribution soon to nab one of the TRULY UNIQUE, hand-made ""limited edition"" perks from Tara!For more information about Tara and her work, go to her website at http://taraskurtu.com or follow her on Twitter at https://twitter.com/TaraSkurtu.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I am the author of six previous books: <i>Mal Occhio: The Underside of Vision </i>(North Point Press: 1981), <i>Dream Streets:The Big Book of Italian American Culture </i>(Harper &amp; Row: 1989), and <i>Una Storia Segreta: The Secret History of Italian American Evacuation and Internment During World War II</i> (Heyday Books: 2001), with both <i>Mal Occhio</i> and the <i>Big Book</i> now under my own Sanniti Publications imprint. Also under the Sanniti imprint are: <i>Esty: A Novel/Memoir</i> (Sanniti: 2008); <i>Branded: How Italian Immigrants Became ‘Enemies’ During WWII</i> (Sanniti: 2015) and <i>Earth Breath: Selected Blogs, 2009-2016</i> (Sanniti: 2016).   </p>
<p>Serious fiction of the kind I am interested in is an endangered species. It is for this reason that I started my own imprint in the first place, and that I am now publishing another novel, this time dramatizing  a love story during the dark days when 600,00 Italian enemy aliens were under U.S. government restriction. It is a story about star-crossed lovers that I believe will have timeless appeal for many many readers.  </p>
<p>By joining in this effort, you can help me to mitigate some of the risk, while acting as the book’s primary readers, supporters and publicizers.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In times past, book publishers often relied on “angels,” wealthy donors who wanted to associate with the gentile world of publishing. Now you, as a lover of literature, can become an “angel” for this book—helping to get <i>Suspect Love</i> into print and the little-known story about the Italian ordeal during WWII into the hands of hundreds, perhaps thousands of readers.</p>
<p>   I have the book designed and it’s ready to be printed. For a modest initial print run, and a little attendant publicity, I figure I need about $1500.00 to begin with.</p>
<p>   Here’s how you can help. For a donation of $50., you get an autographed copy of the book without charge. For $100., you get two autographed copies (give them as gifts). All those who give $150. and up will receive the two copies and be mentioned in print on the book's Acknowledgments page. Beyond that, a $150 donor will be acknowledged in print as a Sponsor, a $200 donor as a Patron, and for $300, you will be thanked as an Angel. Please note that in order to be acknowledged in the printed book, the donation must be received before we go to press on April 1. If there is a second or third printing, we should be able to acknowledge donors who miss this initial deadline. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This is my fourth Indiegogo campaign, all to produce books via my Sanniti Publications imprint. All have been successful, thanks to contributors like you, and I'm hoping you'll be able to help with this one as well. </p>
<p>I have been working on <i>Suspect Love</i> for over ten years and finally have it the way I want it. My intention to write a novel featuring the conflict in the San Francisco Italian community during the war years occurred to me almost as soon as I heard about the story, now known as <i>Una Storia Segreta</i>. Sadly, that story is still a secret to most Americans, and treating it in fiction for a wide audience is one way to make it better known. If the story were to make it into film, its impact would be multiplied many thousands of times. </p>
<p>Since I'm well-known now for my work on <i>Una Storia Segreta</i>, my hope is that this book will find an already-sympathetic audience to help extend its influence far and wide. You can be a part of this project by supporting <i>Suspect Love</i> in its early stages. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As  noted above, book publishing, particularly of serious fiction, has become a high-risk business. Still, there is a particular market for any book that dramatizes little-known histories like this one: the restrictions and internments of Italian immigrants during World War II. By telling the story  of a love affair between two young people on opposite sides of the political divide, key truths of this story--dramatic, emotional--can be conveyed in a way unavailable to historical renderings . My reputation, established via my previous books in this area, should make this all the more possible. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Everyone understands that money is tight these days. But even if you can’t contribute monetarily, you can still help get the word out. Indiegogo has share tools that allow you to spread the word on the web via social media. Personally, you can tell your friends about the book, and about this campaign. Suggest <i>Suspect Love</i> as a great gift book; request it at your local library. Every bit of help, no matter its size or reach, will be deeply appreciated. </p>

My wine training began in France, where I lived and studied for 10 years and was the Editor of Vintage International Magazine in Paris. Over the past decade, as I noticed my favourite wines changing in taste, I have become more specialised in wine and climate change and cool-climate viticulture, which prompted me to found <a href=""http://www.twacci.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">TWACCI</a>, The Wine and Climate Change Institute in Oxford, England.

This is because this is the choice that the world’s winemakers are currently facing as our most well-loved wine regions across the globe shrivel with heat and drought.

A veritable encyclopedia of weirdness!</p>
<p>Any fan can contribute to the site and that is why the SuperWiki is just as incredibly erudite, diverse and quirky as the fandom that creates it. We support fans in learning how to code on the Wiki, create and edit entries or in hosting their own projects on the site.</p>

<p>We want to give you a super-charged, extra awesome Supernatural Wiki that will be here until the end of days!  100% of the money we raise here goes directly into the costs of hosting and maintaining the site.</p>
<p>The Supernatural Wiki is a not-for-profit fandom project. We have always been ad-free and independent – run by fans for fans.  </p>
<p>Two years ago fandom raised  $6,000  for the SupernaturalWiki  and that money has covered our costs since that time.</p>

<p>Our budget for the next two years includes leasing a  server and paying IT support for upgrades, maintaining backup and security systems, and trouble-shooting issues such as spam attacks. The SuperWiki is a big site - in terms of content and the traffic we get - and so that means we need a dedicated server that can cope with that, as well as 24/7 IT support.</p>
<p>Our immediate project is to move to a new server. We've shopped around and will be moving to a server that will optimize performance, and is cheaper than our current one.  We will also get an upgrade of the MediaWiki software and improve our security.</p>

</div></div>","The Supernatural Wiki is a compendium of knowledge about Supernatural and our fandom.  We also will be expanding to cover Wayward Sisters when (hopefully) it airs! 
The Supernatural Wiki is a resource used by both fandom and the people who work on making Supernatural, with over four million visitors a year. There are over 3,500 entries on Winchesters and werewolves, angels and demons, music and mythology, 'ships and shapeshifters, fanfiction, fanart and folklore, the cast and crew, conventions and more.  It is the only online repository of a complete set of transcripts of the series. A veritable encyclopedia of weirdness!
Any fan can contribute to the site and that is why the SuperWiki is just as incredibly erudite, diverse and quirky as the fandom that creates it. We support fans in learning how to code on the Wiki, create and edit entries or in hosting their own projects on the site.
The SupernaturalWiki is supported by our awesome @SuperWiki on Twitter, and you can find us on Tumblr  and Instagram too!

We want to give you a super-charged, extra awesome Supernatural Wiki that will be here until the end of days!  100% of the money we raise here goes directly into the costs of hosting and maintaining the site.
The Supernatural Wiki is a not-for-profit fandom project. We have always been ad-free and independent – run by fans for fans.  
Two years ago fandom raised  $6,000  for the SupernaturalWiki  and that money has covered our costs since that time.

Our budget for the next two years includes leasing a  server and paying IT support for upgrades, maintaining backup and security systems, and trouble-shooting issues such as spam attacks. The SuperWiki is a big site - in terms of content and the traffic we get - and so that means we need a dedicated server that can cope with that, as well as 24/7 IT support.
Our immediate project is to move to a new server. We've shopped around and will be moving to a server that will optimize performance, and is cheaper than our current one.  We will also get an upgrade of the MediaWiki software and improve our security.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>""Set sometime pre the Industrial Revolution, Old Silence, the long-time village sweeper, becomes disillusioned with his vocation after a casual encounter with some of the village children. Whilst the old sweeper retreats to his bed and sinks into a deep melancholy, the village slowly becomes choked with dust. But when the village children realise what needs to be done to save the village they take matters into their own hands, awakening the sweeper from his slump and together they bring the village back to life...""</p>
<p>Several years ago whilst I was teaching at my local remote Goongerah Primary school in Far East Gippsland I wrote 'The Sweeper'. This story just flowed out of me in real time during a literacy lesson. I typed the story onto the Smartboard whilst the kids were working on their own creative writing projects. We then shared our stories. It was inspired modelling on my behalf! Fast forward &amp; after many people suggested I should turn it into a picture book I engaged Aviva Reed to do the illustrations. Once the illustrations were completed I engaged a graphic artist to do the lay out. The investment for this project to date has been $6000 out of my own pocket, as well as several years to get it from idea to print ready. I was certain that the book would be snapped up by a publishing house and sell many copies, so I set out pitching the book to publishers and literary agents, but to my great surprise &amp; dismay nobody offered to publish The Sweeper.</p>
<p>I now see this as an opportunity to self publish under my own boutique Bowler Hat Publishing label with the support of you all, and have a lot more control over my creative endeavours. I believe The Sweeper is good enough to be a Short Listed picture book, so let's make this happen!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>My goal is to do an initial print run of 500 books to get things rolling. Initially Paradigm Print in Queensland will do the first run.</p>
<p>500 books printed  AUD$2,500</p>
<p>Postage and handling AUD $1,500</p>
<p>Other costs AUD $1000 (including recouping some of my initial $6,000 investment)</p>
<p>My main goal is that the book gets published! This will allow me to start selling it through a variety of marketing strategies to recoup my initial investment, and go from there. These include, doing readings at Primary schools and libraries where I will be able to meet and engage with my audience, as well as sell books and do other cross-promotional activities including connecting folk with Zucchini Clan &amp; E3 musiQ. I also plan to do a solo performance of The Sweeper, including making the music for this production.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>My project is valuable as it is a wholly independent creative endeavour which will allow me to gain some control over my financial future. Too often creative folk struggle financially, and getting Bowler Hat Publishing up and running will enable me to work on creating a financially sustainable enterprise.</p>
<p>It is also worthy because my philosophy is to publish books of quality with a positive message, collaborating with various artists and building a credible brand that financially supports both the writer and illustrator.</p>
<p>I have a successful track record with the family friendly band I co-created, Zucchini Clan. Madeline and I have put a lot of time, money and hard work into building Zucchini Clan as a unique, family friendly entertainment enterprise with fantastic music and positive messages. Our upcoming release 'Heirloom Mix' will help us take the next step into growing our profile and brand.</p>
<p>I am also emerging electronic music producer E3 (Esquir3). You can check out my original, expansive electronica and follow me here: soundcloud.com/esquir3</p>
<p>I have always been motivated to make a positive difference and expressing my own unique artistic vision. I believe that providing quality music, literature and engaging experiences really helps kids develop into confident, creative, well adjusted people. A great picture book will stand the test of time, and be an enjoyable read not only for kids, but adults too!</p>
<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
<p>Just starting this project and putting my money where my heart is was risky, but such knock-backs have created the opportunity for me to take control of my own destiny and self publish. We only have to look at Dr Seuss (who I share the birth-date of March 2 with) to see how often publishers get it wrong. His first book, 'And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street' was initially rejected 27 times before being published, and it wasn't until 'The Cat in the Hat' 20 years later in 1957 that he became a household name. So publishers, like record labels, often get things wrong. Keeping this in mind has inspired me to move on and I am determined to get 'The Sweeper' published and distributed into the global marketplace. Once published, I will put in the next lot of hard yards in hitting the street to market the book and my Bowler Hat vision as I have several other stories I have written just waiting for the right illustrators. If you are one, hit me up please!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
</div><div>One can have the best product/service in the world, but if no-one knows about it, its potential can never be realized. I believe that every household with Primary school aged kids should have a copy of 'The Sweeper', so just letting your family/friends with kids know about the book, or better still, buying a copy as a gift helps so much. Books, like songs, are their own best advertisements, and word-of-mouth is always the best promotion.</div><div> </div><div>Also, if you have kids in a Primary school and would like me to come and do a reading and Q&amp;A with the kids, let the school know, and get the ball rolling.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><strong>My name is David D. Simons and I used to live a life of purposelessness. </strong>I grew up in a great home, with awesome parents, and an amazing family yet I still managed to spend a lot of my youth and young adult years living aimlessly. I am on a mission to remove purposelessness because I saw the affect it had on me. I wasn’t a stupid kid but I barely graduated 8th grade. In my junior year of high school I cracked into the system and changed my grades in one of my classes and I was expelled from my high school and also the entire school district. I was told in high school that I was most likely to end up in jail, and unfortunately they were right. I disappointed my family, my community and myself. If that wasn’t enough a few days after turning 18 I was hanging out with the wrong people and I went to cash a check at a bank not knowing the check was stolen. I was told that what I did was a felony and since I just turned 18 I was going to do 6 years in prison at a minimum for what I did.</p>

<p>Thank God for prayers, family, the $10,000 dollars in bail money my mom paid, and an accidental error of me not signing the back of the check. Thankfully I did not end up going to prison. Although I escaped prison, I was still a prisoner to a life of purposelessness, I partied, smoked a lot of weed, and got into more trouble while in college. It wasn’t until a life changing encounter that caused me turned my life around and shortly thereafter I discovered my gifts, my purpose, and who I was meant to be.</p>
<p>Today I run a successful digital marketing agency that helps influential leaders and leading organizations to leverage social media to grow their brands, increase income, and build authority. We also provide world class social media training. The same kid who was told he would end up being a sanitation engineer has now worked alongside Fortune 500 companies Kraft, Frito Lay, Huggies, leading non-profits, NFL players, NBA players churches, Government organizations The Department of Defense, and world renown speakers and entrepreneurs.

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>My aim is to help as many young people, young adults, and even adults who are struggling with the reason for their existence and have no clue at what they are meant to do. Today I live a life of purpose and the major reason why that is so is because I know the clues that lead one to discover themselves and find their God given gifts and abilities that are sometimes difficult to see especially when you are in your own way. I want to help as many young people as I can to find and discover their unique gifts and talents faster and quicker than I did. I want them to avoid spending their youth aimlessly because that time is precious and you can never ever get it back. I want to help young adults who have made their mistakes and do not see the treasures that are within them because their minds are clouded with their failures and disappointments. </p>
<p>I know what’s it like to be a failure, I know what it’s like to have a life but not know the reason for your life, I have experienced some of life’s toughest challenges and the one thing that has been able to help me persevere through it all is knowing my distinct and unique purpose.</p>
<p>Your contribution will aid in helping young people find their gifts, and identify their purpose at a much earlier age in life. This will reduce the amount of crime, hatred, suicide, deaths, poverty, and so much more from our world. You are not just helping to get a book out there, you are stirring up a movement to change societies, cultures, and transform generations. Mark Twain said, there are two important days in ones life. One is the day you are born, and the other is the day you figure out why. Help us to help people learn why they are here.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The only major or risk or challenge we could foresee is not having the book published by our November 2018 goal. We will strive hard to have the goal met and have all the perks and rewards sent out by January 2019.</p>
<p>The bulk of our funding needs are for printing the book and getting the audio version professionally recorded. We will be transparent with you as much as possible - if there are any issues during the production process, we will make it our responsibility to update you in a timely manner.</p>
<p>In the case that shipping gets lost, we will replace the items in your order for you at no additional cost.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Money is not the only type of contribution we value. If you can share on your social media networks, text some of your friends and family, or do an email blast letting people know about what we are doing, that would be much appreciated. </p>
<p>There are a lot easy share tools right on our Indiegogo page, so please feel free to share.</p>
<p>Thank you for help us to fight PURPOSELESSNESS! </p>

I know what’s it like to be a failure, I know what it’s like to have a life but not know the reason for your life, I have experienced some of life’s toughest challenges and the one thing that has been able to help me persevere through it all is knowing my distinct and unique purpose.
Your contribution will aid in helping young people find their gifts, and identify their purpose at a much earlier age in life. This will reduce the amount of crime, hatred, suicide, deaths, poverty, and so much more from our world. You are not just helping to get a book out there, you are stirring up a movement to change societies, cultures, and transform generations. Mark Twain said, there are two important days in ones life. One is the day you are born, and the other is the day you figure out why. Help us to help people learn why they are here.

Risks & Challenges
The only major or risk or challenge we could foresee is not having the book published by our November 2018 goal. We will strive hard to have the goal met and have all the perks and rewards sent out by January 2019.
The bulk of our funding needs are for printing the book and getting the audio version professionally recorded. We will be transparent with you as much as possible - if there are any issues during the production process, we will make it our responsibility to update you in a timely manner.
In the case that shipping gets lost, we will replace the items in your order for you at no additional cost.

Other Ways You Can Help
Money is not the only type of contribution we value. If you can share on your social media networks, text some of your friends and family, or do an email blast letting people know about what we are doing, that would be much appreciated. 
There are a lot easy share tools right on our Indiegogo page, so please feel free to share.

<p>I'm writing a book! A graphic novel to be precise. It’s about my last 4 years of trying to conceive a kid as a single woman. It’s been a journey rife in ups and downs, victories and tragedies, crazy-making moments, lonely wastelands, intense joys, and soul-challenging experiences. </p>
<p>Throughout it, I have found that there are very few books that delve into the wide range of ways that elusive pregnancies and fetal loss happen and affect the people touched by them. The books that do exist, aren't necessarily easily accessible, often don't cover a wide range of experiences, and are usually strictly targeted towards the women (and their partners) struggling to start or grow a family, creating a kind of secret society to which the rest of the world is not privy and therefore has difficulty understanding and supporting in a safe, considerate way.</p>
<p>I want to help break the silence and taboos surrounding the (non)discussion of a journey that can be extremely difficult. I want to create a resource that people can use to feel less lonely in their struggle, and perhaps laugh through their tears.  The book is an honest, compassionate, funny and devastating look into my journey. I want to write it for the other women who have gone, are going, or will go through similar journeys. I want to write it for their families and friends, acquaintances and neighbors, health-care providers and support networks so that they can get a glimpse into what their loved one might be going through, and what these women might or might not need from the people around them. </p>
<p>Because every story is different, and every woman's needs are different, I can only write it from what I have lived. I can only hope that there are enough common threads between my and others' stories that it will actually be helpful.  </p>
<p>Your contribution to the creation of this book will mean that these women will no longer feel quite so alone as they walk through their lives trying to create life.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>This book is no small feat! The goal is to have a 200(ish)-page book finished by the end of March 2019 and then launched by September 2019. As of right now (April 2018), the first draft of the script and storyboards is about half way done. I’m anticipating having the first draft finished by June. My illustrator, Christache Ross, has already started on some character development:</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1523514237/aqwgqrshmllvpqykztzn.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>This is where the need for your support comes in. In order to get the script and stick figure drawings translated into beautiful panels, I am working with the talented illustrator, Christache Ross, to get the book properly drawn, inked, and colored. I am also working with Page 2 Strategies to get the book edited, ready for publication, and, finally, out into the world (including hopefully your bookshelves and/or e-readers :) ).</p>
<p>This all costs some money - to the tune of <strong>$30,000</strong>.</p>
<p>Here's a taste of the kind of thing your donation will allow us to do:</p>
<p>I provide the script and VERY rough storyboards:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1523404603/g0imuppxncylohekl9kc.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>And Christache transforms them into the final product:</p>

<p>Magic!</p>
<p>(But a LOT of work)</p>
<p>That's three pages. We have another 200 or so pages to go! Help us make it happen!</p>
<p>(If you want to read the captions better, a higher res image of the three pager is on the photos page of this site - check 'em out!)</p>
<p>There are some great perks to tempt your tummies including making an appearance in the book (omg you'll be famous!), copies of the book, original storyboard pages, T-shirts or tank tops with some of the book’s fun characters (like Biological Clock, Acceptance Sloth {did you say sloth!}, and Bitterness Thundercloud) and other fun quirky prizes.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>This is a scary book to write. I fully realize that I'm leaving myself vulnerable to a bunch of things. I'm scared of being judged for some of my decisions. I'm scared of the sadnesses that will come up as I write this book. I'm scared of the intensity of feelings that will wash over me as I go over the joys and losses that I've experienced. I'm scared that it will all be too much and I'll have to stop.</p>
<p>But then I think of the potential impact such a book might have on other people. I think of the glimmers of hope, the fading of loneliness, and the relief from devastating secrets that might be an outcome of this graphic novel.</p>
<p>I've never really been known for giving up on big projects. One might say I'm a stubborn mule when it comes to birthing an extravagant project. And really... after everything I've already gone through trying to have a baby, this can't possibly come close to that level of challenge. So here's to a life richly lived and graciously shared! May it help you or someone you know in the same way that it has helped me.</p>
</div><div>

A graphic novel to be precise. It’s about my last 4 years of trying to conceive a kid as a single woman. It’s been a journey rife in ups and downs, victories and tragedies, crazy-making moments, lonely wastelands, intense joys, and soul-challenging experiences. 
Throughout it, I have found that there are very few books that delve into the wide range of ways that elusive pregnancies and fetal loss happen and affect the people touched by them. The books that do exist, aren't necessarily easily accessible, often don't cover a wide range of experiences, and are usually strictly targeted towards the women (and their partners) struggling to start or grow a family, creating a kind of secret society to which the rest of the world is not privy and therefore has difficulty understanding and supporting in a safe, considerate way.
I want to help break the silence and taboos surrounding the (non)discussion of a journey that can be extremely difficult. I want to create a resource that people can use to feel less lonely in their struggle, and perhaps laugh through their tears.  The book is an honest, compassionate, funny and devastating look into my journey. I want to write it for the other women who have gone, are going, or will go through similar journeys. I want to write it for their families and friends, acquaintances and neighbors, health-care providers and support networks so that they can get a glimpse into what their loved one might be going through, and what these women might or might not need from the people around them. 
Because every story is different, and every woman's needs are different, I can only write it from what I have lived. I can only hope that there are enough common threads between my and others' stories that it will actually be helpful.  
Your contribution to the creation of this book will mean that these women will no longer feel quite so alone as they walk through their lives trying to create life.


What We Need & What You Get
This book is no small feat! The goal is to have a 200(ish)-page book finished by the end of March 2019 and then launched by September 2019. As of right now (April 2018), the first draft of the script and storyboards is about half way done. I’m anticipating having the first draft finished by June. My illustrator, Christache Ross, has already started on some character development:

This is where the need for your support comes in. In order to get the script and stick figure drawings translated into beautiful panels, I am working with the talented illustrator, Christache Ross, to get the book properly drawn, inked, and colored. I am also working with Page 2 Strategies to get the book edited, ready for publication, and, finally, out into the world (including hopefully your bookshelves and/or e-readers :) ).
This all costs some money - to the tune of $30,000.
Here's a taste of the kind of thing your donation will allow us to do:
I provide the script and VERY rough storyboards:

And Christache transforms them into the final product:

Magic!
(But a LOT of work)
That's three pages. We have another 200 or so pages to go! Help us make it happen!
(If you want to read the captions better, a higher res image of the three pager is on the photos page of this site - check 'em out!)
There are some great perks to tempt your tummies including making an appearance in the book (omg you'll be famous!), copies of the book, original storyboard pages, T-shirts or tank tops with some of the book’s fun characters (like Biological Clock, Acceptance Sloth {did you say sloth!}, and Bitterness Thundercloud) and other fun quirky prizes.

Risks & Challenges
This is a scary book to write. I fully realize that I'm leaving myself vulnerable to a bunch of things. I'm scared of being judged for some of my decisions. I'm scared of the sadnesses that will come up as I write this book. I'm scared of the intensity of feelings that will wash over me as I go over the joys and losses that I've experienced. I'm scared that it will all be too much and I'll have to stop.
But then I think of the potential impact such a book might have on other people. I think of the glimmers of hope, the fading of loneliness, and the relief from devastating secrets that might be an outcome of this graphic novel.
I've never really been known for giving up on big projects. One might say I'm a stubborn mule when it comes to birthing an extravagant project. And really... after everything I've already gone through trying to have a baby, this can't possibly come close to that level of challenge. So here's to a life richly lived and graciously shared! May it help you or someone you know in the same way that it has helped me.

Other Ways You Can Help
If you're unable to give financially, here are some other wonderful and super helpful ways to help out:

Spread the word about the project and fundraiser directly to your friends, family, acquaintances, colleagues, and any fertility or pregnancy-related connections you may have.
Share the campaign and your vote of confidence over all the social media platforms: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, your blogs, your vlogs, and your dialogues. 
Write and publish an article in a magazine, newspaper, or on-line outlet about the book. Give a podcast, radio, or tv interview about the project. 

In whatever way you choose to and are able to contribute to the creation and dissemination of this book, I thank you in advance!

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>After printing issue 1 of FRIDAY Magazine I realized that the printing process can be tricky if you're not prepared for surprises. Sometimes things don't turn out as expected when they are translated from digital to tangible format. As with any printing endeavor, things can potentially go wrong during the printing and mailing process. Printing deadlines could get pushed back if there are mix-ups with layouts and proofs. Mail could get delayed. I will do everything I can to have rewards delivered when I say they will be delivered, but the mail can sometimes do strange things, so this could be a challenge.</p>
<p>My hope is that this project will help fund issues 2, 3, and 4 of FRIDAY Magazine, which will finish out the 2018 year! Issue 1 was a learning process on the design, curation, printing and mailing front and now we're ready to take what we learned and make issues 2, 3 and 4 bigger and better!</p>

<p>All I knew at the time about the characters were that they were best friends, and they were somehow going to become superheroes. This was 2007, a few years before social media took over our every day lives.</p>
<p>I wrote a screenplay featuring Rex and Ted and sent it to the industry contacts I had made while in film school. The few meetings I was able to setup did not go as planned. No one wanted to read a screenplay about two pop culture obsessed teenagers who came across a crashed UFO and became superheroes. I had been living with the characters for three years, but with no takers for my script, I was forced to move on.</p>
<p>For the next five years The Adventures of Rex and Ted would sit on a shelf above my work shirts.</p>
<p>Oddly enough, the big shot talent agencies that rejected my manuscript were looking to hire me to help develop two new projects.</p>
<p>Things were going great until both projects got locked up in turn around 48 hours apart. After witnessing my personal anguish, a literary agent at the Gersh talent agency suggested that I hone my skills at novel writing.</p>

The Backstory
Months before completing the One Year Screenwriting program at The New York Film Academy, I got an idea for my thesis project. It revolved around two ninth graders, one was African American, and the other was Hispanic.

All I knew at the time about the characters were that they were best friends, and they were somehow going to become superheroes. This was 2007, a few years before social media took over our every day lives.
I wrote a screenplay featuring Rex and Ted and sent it to the industry contacts I had made while in film school. The few meetings I was able to setup did not go as planned. No one wanted to read a screenplay about two pop culture obsessed teenagers who came across a crashed UFO and became superheroes. I had been living with the characters for three years, but with no takers for my script, I was forced to move on.
For the next five years The Adventures of Rex and Ted would sit on a shelf above my work shirts.
Oddly enough, the big shot talent agencies that rejected my manuscript were looking to hire me to help develop two new projects.
Things were going great until both projects got locked up in turn around 48 hours apart. After witnessing my personal anguish, a literary agent at the Gersh talent agency suggested that I hone my skills at novel writing.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>I am Khaya Maseko. I have been a Writer, mostly in the field of Poetry. I have been an executive member of Nowadays Poetry Organization for 15 years.  My work has always been driven by the ethic: Get people to read more. It is in this vein that I wrote a book about home while travelling South Africa in 2011.</li>
<li>The campaign of Mashu oMusha is important because it is rare. South Africa is criminally short of Black Science Fiction works.  Our townships are not venues for heroes and dreams, Rather than dwell on the lacking, I decided to fill at least a part of this void with my novella. it is 120 page A5 book that I believe will make changes bigger than it's diminutive size.</li>
</ul>
<p>I cannot express the magnitude of the importance of your contributions. As a creative thinker, I have many well-planned ways to pull off this project, but not the funds. Our government institutions have not paid attention, and so I seek the help of the global community to help fund this very important project. it is but a book, but with your help, it will be a global myth and legend.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Publishing is slightly expensive, especially for an independent publisher. Here is how much I explicitly need.<ul>
<li>ZAR2000 for softcover promo prints of the book.</li>
<li>ZAR6000 Perfect bind as many books as possible. </li>
<li>ZAR4000 for venue hire and admin</li>
<li>ZAR5000 for anomalous emergencies</li>
<li><p>If we raise more than this, any extra funds will go to the perfect binding of the book.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>South Africa needs this. The excitement that I have received and positive reinforcement has been stupendous! It seems high time for a unique story told from the vantage of the Nguni people. This has been in very short supply even though the private demand is high. We seek to make this book a global hit, and with your help, that will surely happen.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Books are a core part of any civilization. We can see how the story of the burning of Alexandria library can survive thousands of years. Well building myths to help a new age of youth find themselves is just as important. We need to fuel the minds of the impoverished to think beyond their station. To break confines and build their own frames of reference. When it comes to this end, SciFi is a great tool. It stimulates futurism and the ability to dream new solutions. I aim to publicize this book in this manner. To really emphasize the impace it can and will make if given the light of day.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The risks of funding a literary project are not so high, but they are there. I am not so deluded as to think that i am a literary master, but i have faith in this work.</p>
<p>If we miss the mark with sales or crowdfunding capital, we will have to re-evaluate our marketing strategy. At this point, it is about touring the country raising awareness to the existence of this book. It is also about getting our name out there so that funding of this and future projects becomes more possible.  The only way his can fail is if I sit on my ass and not work hard to get this book out there. That WILL NOT happen.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some of you may not be able to financially contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help:</p>

<li>Please spread the word about the book and upcoming events, there are Indiegogo share tools you can use!</li>

It is in this vein that I wrote a book about home while travelling South Africa in 2011.
The campaign of Mashu oMusha is important because it is rare. South Africa is criminally short of Black Science Fiction works.  Our townships are not venues for heroes and dreams, Rather than dwell on the lacking, I decided to fill at least a part of this void with my novella. it is 120 page A5 book that I believe will make changes bigger than it's diminutive size.

I cannot express the magnitude of the importance of your contributions. As a creative thinker, I have many well-planned ways to pull off this project, but not the funds. Our government institutions have not paid attention, and so I seek the help of the global community to help fund this very important project. it is but a book, but with your help, it will be a global myth and legend.

What We Need & What You Get
 

Publishing is slightly expensive, especially for an independent publisher. Here is how much I explicitly need.
ZAR2000 for softcover promo prints of the book.
ZAR6000 Perfect bind as many books as possible. 
ZAR4000 for venue hire and admin
ZAR5000 for anomalous emergencies
If we raise more than this, any extra funds will go to the perfect binding of the book.


South Africa needs this. The excitement that I have received and positive reinforcement has been stupendous! It seems high time for a unique story told from the vantage of the Nguni people. This has been in very short supply even though the private demand is high. We seek to make this book a global hit, and with your help, that will surely happen.


The Impact
Books are a core part of any civilization. We can see how the story of the burning of Alexandria library can survive thousands of years. Well building myths to help a new age of youth find themselves is just as important. We need to fuel the minds of the impoverished to think beyond their station. To break confines and build their own frames of reference. When it comes to this end, SciFi is a great tool. It stimulates futurism and the ability to dream new solutions. I aim to publicize this book in this manner. To really emphasize the impace it can and will make if given the light of day.

Risks & Challenges
The risks of funding a literary project are not so high, but they are there. I am not so deluded as to think that i am a literary master, but i have faith in this work.
If we miss the mark with sales or crowdfunding capital, we will have to re-evaluate our marketing strategy. At this point, it is about touring the country raising awareness to the existence of this book. It is also about getting our name out there so that funding of this and future projects becomes more possible.  The only way his can fail is if I sit on my ass and not work hard to get this book out there. That WILL NOT happen.

Other Ways You Can Help
Some of you may not be able to financially contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help:

Please spread the word about the book and upcoming events, there are Indiegogo share tools you can use!

<p>Hello all! I’m Akim Prettyman and I live in Maryland with
my 14 year old son and 1 year old daughter. I received my Master of Arts in
Teaching degree in Early Childhood Education in 2014. I am also a graduate of
the University of Maryland College Park. I've been teaching and caring for
young children for as long as I can remember.</p>
<p>I spent endless hours reading as a child, and now share
my love for books with both my children. One of my favorite things to do is to
snuggle up with my little one and read a good book. I consistently look for
books to read to her with diverse images of children especially those with
beautiful dark brown skin like hers. Unfortunately, people of color are still very
underrepresented in books for young children. What an awful message it sends to
children when they consistently read books that don't reflect images that look
like what they see in the mirror!</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Every child is beautiful!! </b></p>
<p><b>Every skin tone is beautiful!!</b></p>
<p><b>Every child is special!!</b></p>

<p>Recently, I began writing my first children's book,

 I'm a poet and graphic designer who has been self-publishing on scrolls for a few years. It is a really fun way to experience poetry and I want to take my poetry publishing to the next level!  
A mobile workstation for production and distribution.
Making DIY machines to speed up production.
Enough stock to submit to a distributor.
 An efficient website for better access to products.
  I'm starting primarily with my own poetry and that of a few close friends but plan to grow as I find more poets with inspiring messages. These scrolls are super cheap to make albeit time-consuming.  The packaging I have designed is also easy to make with a few more tools.   The Means of Production!
 To get this long term goal off the ground I need:  $3500 for my friends  old camper for use as a work station/office.
 $500 will make an awesome DIY die cutter for the boxes
 $500 will make my amazing invention THE SCROLL ROLLER come to life!
All the rest of the campaign covers the first run of 1000 scrolls 300 boxes and all the little odds and ends including LLC and publishing structure.    The FUTURE!
 It won't be immediately after the campaign ends, but after I am funded the work gets amped up. Collecting poets and reaching publishing agreements, editing and formatting with them and then on to production.  All of my poetry will be available right away and will be offered as perks. I have several printing shops I'm working with and ready to mass produce. Once the mobile studio starts rolling:  Physical products will be ready for shelves and the online shop with monthly new features.

I'll be on a regular open mic tour to find incredible new poetry.
Potential for advertising on the boxes and website.
Poetry reaches new audiences and a new era!!
    Why Crowdfunding?

</p><p>BITÁCORA TURISMO TIC Y TERRITORIO es una empresa joven formada por un
equipo multidisciplinar muy implicado en su principal proyecto, GEApp.
Comenzamos nuestra andadura en noviembre de 2015 y gracias a nuestro trabajo y
esfuerzo, GEApp está ya presente en seis ciudades españolas. María y Javier son
los responsables de esta iniciativa que pretende acercar al turista al
monumento más impresionante del mundo: la Alhambra de Granada.</p>
<p>Visitar la Alhambra de Granada de forma independiente y con un contenido
original y atractivo es la experiencia que estabas esperando. Por eso, desde
GEApp queremos que esta ruta multimedia en la Alhambra se haga realidad y que
pueda acercar a la gente a este monumento para que descubran sus secretos,
leyendas, palacios perdidos y todos los rincones que esconde en su interior.</p>
<p>Gracias a la colaboración de todo el que quiera aportar su granito de
arena, GEApp podrá sacar al mercado una nueva ruta multimedia del conjunto
monumental de la Alhambra y el Generalife de Granada, con un contenido único
que incluye información audioguiada, cómics, vídeos y fotografías.</p>
<p>Necesitamos 6.000€ que irán destinados a la creación del contenido de la
ruta para la Alhambra, ya que el soporte en la app ya está operativo. El
contenido consta de una serie de cómics con locuciones y música, así como varias
reconstrucciones en 3D de palacios y lugares perdidos. Además, estará
disponible en español, inglés y francés. Por todo ello, necesitamos contar con
profesionales como dibujantes, traductores e incluso músicos que creen un
contenido único e inigualable para que la ruta tenga la calidad que el usuario
merece.</p>
<p>Lo mejor de todo son las recompensas que ofrecemos. Por un lado, nuestros
colaboradores podrán disfrutar de la ruta multimedia de la Alhambra de forma
gratuita, una vez esté disponible en el mercado. Además, ofrecemos microtours
guiados por la ciudad de Granada, una nueva manera de conocer la ciudad. El
concepto es sencillo: pequeños recorridos por un precio igualmente pequeño y
acompañados por los mejores guías. </p>
<p>Si no logramos la meta total, los fondos que consigamos irán destinados a
lanzar la ruta de la Alhambra con el contenido básico monumental que podamos
incluir con el presupuesto alcanzado. Sería una pena no poder incluir todos los
cómics y contenido multimedia que tenemos proyectado, así que esperemos poder
conseguir crear todo el valor añadido posible a esta nueva ruta.</p>
<p>Nuestro proyecto es valioso para el colaborador y para el mundo entero
porque va a permitir visitar el monumento más bello por un módico precio, de
forma independiente y con un contenido único. El usuario podrá vivir una
experiencia inolvidable en uno de los entornos más impresionantes de la
historia: la Alhambra de Granada. Además, el contenido será audioguiado y
enseñará las claves para comprender este monumento y su relevancia patrimonial
e histórica.</p>
<p>GEApp ya ofrece rutas en seis ciudades españolas entre las que se
encuentran Granana, Madrid, Córdoba, Málaga, Sevilla y Palma de Mallorca. Está
teniendo muy buena acogida por la gente y día a día sigue aumentando el volumen
de usuarios.</p>
<p>La Alhambra es una ciudad única que puede estar más cerca de ti gracias a
GEApp. Con nuestra app podrás recorrer las calles de la medina, visitar la
Alcazaba y sus torres, el Generalife y sus jardines, los Palacios y los
rincones más impresionantes y bellos de este lugar. Además, podrás trasladarte
a épocas pasadas y descubrir cómo eran algunos de los palacios perdidos gracias
a reconstrucciones en 3D.</p>
<p>Desde que comenzamos nuestra andadura con GEApp nos hemos enfrentado a
numerosos retos y gracias a nuestra creatividad y constancia hemos conseguido
que los problemas de financiación no nos frenen en nuestro empeño por crear
rutas que permitan al turista descubrir una ciudad a su aire.</p>
<p>Nuestro principal plan es seguir trabajando día a día para salvar los
obstáculos y seguir consiguiendo los medios que necesitamos para seguir
funcionando. Por eso, seguimos trabajando con nuestra informática, Asun, para ampliar
las funcionalidades de GEApp y poder satisfacer todas las necesidades de
nuestros clientes.</p>
<p>Si no puedes colaborar con nosotros económicamente, sí puedes hacer que

<h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
<p>MACKENZY JOSEPH</p>
<p>PROFESSOR / WRITER / INVENTOR &amp; GLOBAL INNOVATIONS SERVICES INC FOUNDER</p>
<p>BIOGRAPHY</p>
<p>Having experiences working at private and public universities in Mexico (UREI,TEC DE MATEHUALA S,L,TEC DE DELICIAS CHIHUAHUA), for the last past 18 years, Mr. Mackenzy Joseph has held the position of an English Teacher. On February 25th, 2005 he has found a few methods through his own technique that could make learning English easier, thus he became the author of the English book titled ¨The Easiest Way to Learn and Teach English/Spanish¨. Facing the need to help those interesting in learning French, and using his own textbook in younger classrooms he came up with the idea of writing a French book on march 6th,2009 titled ¨La Meilleure Façon D´apprendre  et  D´enseigner  Le Français¨, wanted profusely to own an international company, he started to search for a non-compete product in the marketplace that could help families in their savings, thus show up the idea of Multi-belt, an invention  which will serve as four belts in one and which will help people in the combination of their dress code. From that idea came up the creation of his company named Global Innovations Services incorporated on March 15th, 2012 in New York. After a positive publication result of his invention, he acquired the permit to patent the idea in different countries to launch it to the Market under the rule section of the Worldwide Intellectual Property (WIPO). In 2013 he went through a financial hardship which stopped him moving forward with his projects. Through innovations and hard work; he has always motivated himself and those around him to do their best. he has been a creative Teacher and an excellent role model dedicated to his work, family, and friends maintaining a high standard for  himself as well as those he worked with, he has always provided the necessary support to help his students succeed as well try to make a change in the world through his belt innovative idea and his books.</p>

</div></div>","ABOUT THIS PROJECT
The Easiest Way to Learn and Teach English/Spanish is a bilingual book with the beginning and intermediate level course created especially for people whose first language is English or Spanish. That book has been designed to help both English/Spanish speakers to speak effectively the language or even help the others who would like to learn.
Over 18 years I have used my own textbook, and methods teaching English/Spanish in different schools and universities to  Foreigners and national Mexican students. This textbook has become a great success. I would like to give the books to orphan children by helping them to learn English or Spanish, I need to raise $7,700 dollars to get the recording book lessons done.We are willing to give out English and Spanish lessons at a huge discount. At my partners website www.LearnEnglish.mx
Risks and challenges
This book has already been printed and published on www.amazon.com  and www.westbowpress.com  for sale. The risks and challenges that remain are not having enough financial resources to pay professionals to finish recording the step by step.These Audio lessons will help orphan children and others who needed to speak correctly with the proper pronunciation. Recording, producing the digital CDs, packaging and shipping the books on time are other challenges. However, I will use Indiegogo

funding to ensure this project gets done in a timely fashion.

BIOGRAPHY
Having experiences working at private and public universities in Mexico (UREI,TEC DE MATEHUALA S,L,TEC DE DELICIAS CHIHUAHUA), for the last past 18 years, Mr. Mackenzy Joseph has held the position of an English Teacher. On February 25th, 2005 he has found a few methods through his own technique that could make learning English easier, thus he became the author of the English book titled ¨The Easiest Way to Learn and Teach English/Spanish¨. Facing the need to help those interesting in learning French, and using his own textbook in younger classrooms he came up with the idea of writing a French book on march 6th,2009 titled ¨La Meilleure Façon D´apprendre  et  D´enseigner  Le Français¨, wanted profusely to own an international company, he started to search for a non-compete product in the marketplace that could help families in their savings, thus show up the idea of Multi-belt, an invention  which will serve as four belts in one and which will help people in the combination of their dress code. From that idea came up the creation of his company named Global Innovations Services incorporated on March 15th, 2012 in New York. After a positive publication result of his invention, he acquired the permit to patent the idea in different countries to launch it to the Market under the rule section of the Worldwide Intellectual Property (WIPO). In 2013 he went through a financial hardship which stopped him moving forward with his projects. Through innovations and hard work; he has always motivated himself and those around him to do their best. he has been a creative Teacher and an excellent role model dedicated to his work, family, and friends maintaining a high standard for  himself as well as those he worked with, he has always provided the necessary support to help his students succeed as well try to make a change in the world through his belt innovative idea and his books.
