<p>Like many of you, we were using a bed-side charger plugged in to a wall 
outlet every night.  One day, one of the night lights on the wall was 
accidentally kicked, and the plate broke. As I was thinking where to move the 
night light, I realized that all the outlets were behind the sofa or a cabinet.  
I looked at the wall switch and thought it would be great if there was an 
available outlet that I could use. After checking Google, I found an existing 
wall combo switch that could do just that. I ordered it and replace the wall 
switch with the combo switch.  Simple enough, and the night light had a new 
home.  </p>
<p>Later, however, I found that my kids had unplugged the night light and 
instead plugged in their phone charger to charge their phones.  Since there was 
no place near the switch to put the phone, they just put it on top of the 
charger.  That's what gave me the idea to make something to hold the phone on 
top of the charger.  My daughter Joycelyn, who is a talented artist, came up 
with a nice looking design for the device, and the Switcharger was born. We 
applied for a patent on our invention and hope that it will bring sanity to 
people having to charge all of their electronic devices.</p>

<h3>What is Phonechievements?</h3>
<p>Phonechievements is an Android app that comes with a list of goals that gives more color to your daily phone usage. The main goal of the app is to give you tiny rewards for using your phone (e.g. send/receive a number of SMS, place a number of calls, keep your phone alive without charging for a given time, have a number of apps installed and many others)<span style=""font-size: 1.17em;""><br/></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Phonechievements can be ""used"" in different ways: you can just leave it in the background and enjoy when you get an unlock notification or be an achievement hunter and do everything you can to unlock as many as possible. It's up to you.</p>
<p>Besides that, Phonechievements is also social. You can share your accomplishments with friends via Facebook, Twitter or Google +, and you can also sync your progress on an online profile.</p>
<p>The app is FREE an can be found on <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pixelmark.phonechievements"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Google Play Link"">Google Play</a>. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The app is free, then WHY raising money?</h3>
<p>Well, as you can see in the video I am using an HTC Desire for the app development. Of course there is an emulator but with so many phones and android versions it is very difficult to identify some newer Android versions issues and fix them. The community that enjoys the app wants quality and I would like to provide it, but I need a new Android phone, with the latest version.</p>
<p>Why? Well, statistically most users have Android &gt;= 4.0 and also most of the issues come from these versions.</p>
<p>So, a new phone would help me a lot to debug and quickly fix any reported issues.</p>
<h3>More?</h3>
<p>If I can get enough funds (for a new phone and some coffee to keep me awake in the night when I develop :) ) I could also get into the iPhone world. If some of you would like to see this on their iOS based devices, I am willing to develop such a version, however, like the Android issue, I would need a phone. So it all depends of your support.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There's not much I can offer you but I also added some perks for different amounts.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

Enriched International Business Experiences for over 35 years based in Asia.</p>
<p>I was the first one to promote Primary School Computer Education in Hong Kong,, Taiwan and Malaysia about 20 years ago. During recent 11 years, concentrated to develop Health-care Products especially in China and Asean Countries. Now, being as Business Consultant for Asia EMT &amp; Paramedic in Malaysia, which is to develop EMT &amp; Paramedic Training Program uniquely for Asia people.. ( <a href=""http://www.asiaemtp.webs.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.asiaemtp.webs.com</a> )  Besides, I am also an Inventor, having invented some new Medical Devices under Patent Protection, in which only Safety &amp; Quality (S&amp;Q) Surgical Scalpel is focused in this Indiegogo Project.</p>
<p><strong>In order to solve HIV/AIDS problem, whole world has done at the utmost:</strong></p>
<p><strong>~ Relief to the HIV/AIDS people;</strong></p>
<p><strong>~ Gift of Condoms;</strong></p>
<p><strong>~ Exchange of Syringe Program;</strong></p>
<p><strong>~ etc…..</strong></p>
<p><strong>But all of these are PASSIVE OPERATIONS only, similar as surrender to HIV/AIDS, in my opinion!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Before valid medications of HIV/AIDS comes out, why don’t do some operations ACTIVELY to fight back HIV/AIDS?</strong></p>
<p><strong>One of Examples, such as: Sharps &amp; Needle Injuries!</strong></p>
<p>HIV/AIDS transmission should not be only arose from sex and drug-abusers , there is also not rare due to the sharps and needle injuries accidentally happen to the respectable healthcare workers and medical students who should not be ignored. Especially for the surgical nurses who are still nervous everyday to fix and drag the used bloody surgical blade from the current traditional surgical scalpel with which they still keep using over half of century, this may bring them the nightmare in any minute as according to the following Statistic:</p>
<p><strong>WHO Statistic</strong>: Globally, it is estimated that sharps injuries cause about 66,000 HBV, 165,000 HIV infections among health-care workers each year..</p>
<p><strong>OSHA Statistic</strong>: Estimates that only in USA 5.6 million workers in the healthcare industry and related occupations are at such risk. Nursing staff are most frequently injured. This bloodborne infections have serious consequence, including long-term illness, disability and death.    </p>
<p><strong>Statistics from Australia Medical Industry</strong><strong> Association</strong>: At least One in Nine nurses in NSW will suffer a sharps injury each year.</p>
<p>Now, this problem possible be mostly solved, pls. refer to my invention, S&amp;Q Safety Scalpel as shown on my Presentation Movie, which undoubtedly enables to safeguard any users, such as Surgical Nurses, Medical Students etc. from the bloody sharps injuries, resulting prevention of HIV/AIDS, further to minimize its transmission over the world as well.</p>
<p><strong>Traditional Surgical Scalpel</strong> is generally made of metal, its weakness is dangerous when fixing the blade, which is pressed and congested tightly into the groove on the Handle with fingers, so that, after use, the nurse must use same big force to drag the bloody blade out of the groove with fingers also. It makes the surgical nurses very nervous every day, afraid of being hurt by the bloody blade, resulting to get HIV/AIDS etc. possibly.</p>
<p><strong>My invented S&amp;Q Safety Scalpel</strong> is also made of metal, but with ease to pave the blade on the Handle surface for use without force, and feel relax to release the bloody blade without touch, just by turning the Handle over, the blade will fall off automatically and the user discards the bloody blade as usual.. (Pls. refer to the Movie )  Clinical trials taken in Singapore, China, Malaysia and Denmark, Surgeons gave good comments, especially the nurses generally like it, so that, once they use my S&amp;Q,  they must buy my specific blades which outlook, sharpness and cost are exactly the same as traditional blades, except that the “Groove” on my blade is tailor-made under my patent coverage.</p>
<p><strong>Marketing Strategies</strong>:</p>
<p>At beginning marketing for promotion, my SQ Handle will be sold without making margin to the hospitals through Regional Distributors, our benefit mainly derived from the Sales of our specific blades later for long term. .</p>
<p><strong>Business Profit</strong>: Initially, Margin is small, but later will grow bigger and bigger within the first year expectedly, until one day in future, all of nurses worldwide get used to use my S&amp;Q, they will abandon the Traditional Scalpel, this is my dream!</p>
<p><strong>Current Problem</strong>: Now, # 4 S&amp;Q Handles as seen on the movie are ready, but most hospitals like to get #3 Handles also together for their more convenience. This causes me into trouble, because of having already spent all my savings on related R&amp;D, so that I am now lack of funding to produce the #3 Handles, which outlook is the same as #4, but shorter only, therefore, no technical problem.</p>
<p><strong>REQUEST:</strong> May I hereby request for your HEROIC Support, targeting to raise up a funding about US$15,000. I will use the fund through Indiegogo to order the tool of #3 Handle for production in March 2013 , (the more if I get, will order more tools to produce handles of #5, #6, #7, #9 etc.)  and also to build a S&amp;Q Web-site, so as to let me expand  worldwide marketing through more Regional Sole Distributors ASAP, expectantly to minimize the transmission of HIV/AIDS &amp; other Virus, so as to save more lives in the world. Contrarily, if I don’t reach my entire goal, I still will keep my promise to fulfill the Rewards promptly,  and can supply #3 S&amp;Q Scalpel (made by mould) and Blades to the Perk of Distributor(s) when they place me the order because it can help me get the Bank loan to order the tool for #3 Handle and Blades without problem.

Enriched International Business Experiences for over 35 years based in Asia.
I was the first one to promote Primary School Computer Education in Hong Kong,, Taiwan and Malaysia about 20 years ago. During recent 11 years, concentrated to develop Health-care Products especially in China and Asean Countries. Now, being as Business Consultant for Asia EMT & Paramedic in Malaysia, which is to develop EMT & Paramedic Training Program uniquely for Asia people.. ( www.asiaemtp.webs.com )  Besides, I am also an Inventor, having invented some new Medical Devices under Patent Protection, in which only Safety & Quality (S&Q) Surgical Scalpel is focused in this Indiegogo Project.
In order to solve HIV/AIDS problem, whole world has done at the utmost:
~ Relief to the HIV/AIDS people;
~ Gift of Condoms;
~ Exchange of Syringe Program;
~ etc…..
But all of these are PASSIVE OPERATIONS only, similar as surrender to HIV/AIDS, in my opinion!
Before valid medications of HIV/AIDS comes out, why don’t do some operations ACTIVELY to fight back HIV/AIDS?
One of Examples, such as: Sharps & Needle Injuries!
HIV/AIDS transmission should not be only arose from sex and drug-abusers , there is also not rare due to the sharps and needle injuries accidentally happen to the respectable healthcare workers and medical students who should not be ignored. Especially for the surgical nurses who are still nervous everyday to fix and drag the used bloody surgical blade from the current traditional surgical scalpel with which they still keep using over half of century, this may bring them the nightmare in any minute as according to the following Statistic:
WHO Statistic: Globally, it is estimated that sharps injuries cause about 66,000 HBV, 165,000 HIV infections among health-care workers each year..
OSHA Statistic: Estimates that only in USA 5.6 million workers in the healthcare industry and related occupations are at such risk. Nursing staff are most frequently injured. This bloodborne infections have serious consequence, including long-term illness, disability and death.    
Statistics from Australia Medical Industry Association: At least One in Nine nurses in NSW will suffer a sharps injury each year.
Now, this problem possible be mostly solved, pls. refer to my invention, S&Q Safety Scalpel as shown on my Presentation Movie, which undoubtedly enables to safeguard any users, such as Surgical Nurses, Medical Students etc. from the bloody sharps injuries, resulting prevention of HIV/AIDS, further to minimize its transmission over the world as well.
Traditional Surgical Scalpel is generally made of metal, its weakness is dangerous when fixing the blade, which is pressed and congested tightly into the groove on the Handle with fingers, so that, after use, the nurse must use same big force to drag the bloody blade out of the groove with fingers also. It makes the surgical nurses very nervous every day, afraid of being hurt by the bloody blade, resulting to get HIV/AIDS etc. possibly.
My invented S&Q Safety Scalpel is also made of metal, but with ease to pave the blade on the Handle surface for use without force, and feel relax to release the bloody blade without touch, just by turning the Handle over, the blade will fall off automatically and the user discards the bloody blade as usual.. (Pls. refer to the Movie )  Clinical trials taken in Singapore, China, Malaysia and Denmark, Surgeons gave good comments, especially the nurses generally like it, so that, once they use my S&Q,  they must buy my specific blades which outlook, sharpness and cost are exactly the same as traditional blades, except that the “Groove” on my blade is tailor-made under my patent coverage.
Marketing Strategies:
At beginning marketing for promotion, my SQ Handle will be sold without making margin to the hospitals through Regional Distributors, our benefit mainly derived from the Sales of our specific blades later for long term. .
Business Profit: Initially, Margin is small, but later will grow bigger and bigger within the first year expectedly, until one day in future, all of nurses worldwide get used to use my S&Q, they will abandon the Traditional Scalpel, this is my dream!
Current Problem: Now, # 4 S&Q Handles as seen on the movie are ready, but most hospitals like to get #3 Handles also together for their more convenience. This causes me into trouble, because of having already spent all my savings on related R&D, so that I am now lack of funding to produce the #3 Handles, which outlook is the same as #4, but shorter only, therefore, no technical problem.
REQUEST: May I hereby request for your HEROIC Support, targeting to raise up a funding about US$15,000. I will use the fund through Indiegogo to order the tool of #3 Handle for production in March 2013 , (the more if I get, will order more tools to produce handles of #5, #6, #7, #9 etc.)  and also to build a S&Q Web-site, so as to let me expand  worldwide marketing through more Regional Sole Distributors ASAP, expectantly to minimize the transmission of HIV/AIDS & other Virus, so as to save more lives in the world. Contrarily, if I don’t reach my entire goal, I still will keep my promise to fulfill the Rewards promptly,  and can supply #3 S&Q Scalpel (made by mould) and Blades to the Perk of Distributor(s) when they place me the order because it can help me get the Bank loan to order the tool for #3 Handle and Blades without problem. (Handmade #3 Scalpel does not need mould, so that, no problem even under this circumstance.)  
HEROIC PERFORMANCE: It should be a great worthy achievement! Not only to me, your HEROIC Support on this Indiegogo Project will benefit to the whole world people! In order to express my gratitude, besides my own S&Q Scalpel, I also arrange some interesting Rewards which are supported by the friendly factories specially for this Campaign, such as: S&Q Not-fade Sticker, S&Q Whistle Key Finder, and quality Waterproof Touch Screen Mobile Phone Watches etc. (One Year Warranty), wishing you all to be the Hero to enjoy a significant coming Merry X’mas!
APPRECIATION ALSO! However, if this time you cannot help, never-mind, I still appreciate if you could kindly get the word out and make some noise about my campaign by using the Indiegogo share tools with thanks! 
Finally, most thanks to Indiegogo , for giving me the chance to online my Project here! Thank you all!

<p><b>The Single Screen Way to Manage Your Day!</b></p>
<p>myTIKR is a dynamic, new technology
mobile application that offers an innovative new way to view, engage, and
enjoy the content of a user’s most-used apps all at once on the smartphone
screen, instead of having to constantly open and close independent apps such as
emails, Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, Newsy, ESPN, and Nasdaq. </p>
<p>myTIKR uses ticker tapes displaying
real-time data crawling horizontally for each app, with multiple tracks stacked
on top of each other, comprising a full-screen matrix snapshot of the user’s
most used apps. </p>
<p>The user glances down at his phone
and sees all desired app content moving slowly in real-time across the screen,
and then taps a finger on the scrolling graphic or text hyperlink icon to view
the full-sized native content. Once finished with viewing that particular
content, one swipe takes the user back to the scrolling app matrix
dashboard. myTIKR is an app aggregator that brings all your social feeds
and content streams together into a simple, elegant, and customizable
application across all your digital devices.</p>
<p>Cheers, my name is Brad Simpson. I am the creator of the
myTIKR application. With myTIKR, you can access, check and manage your
“always-on” apps with an elegant, customizable single dashboard screen
(currently patent-pending technology). I created myTIKR to solve a few problems
I was having with managing my smartphone application use. To date, there are
over 1.5 million applications available for download from Apple iTunes and
Google Play. On average, each smartphone user checks apps over 35 times a day,
spending over 30 seconds per app. Whether or not we are ready to accept it, we
now live in a society of “App-Addicted” people controlled by their “Most Used”
apps. For me, having so many apps made my phone (and me) slow and inefficient.</p>

My concept became the brainchild of myTIKR: to design a smartphone app aggregator that brings all your social feeds and content streams together in a simple, elegant, and customizable application across all your digital devices.                      
myTIKR takes Manhattan!  Our team is heading to New
York to meet with our Golden Gekko development team and discuss some details,
not the least of which will be our official launch date!  Stay tuned here
or on www.mytikr.com
for more details.  All the TIKRheads are so excited to see the vision
moving forward.
The Single Screen Way to Manage Your Day!
myTIKR is a dynamic, new technology
mobile application that offers an innovative new way to view, engage, and
enjoy the content of a user’s most-used apps all at once on the smartphone
screen, instead of having to constantly open and close independent apps such as
emails, Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, Newsy, ESPN, and Nasdaq. 
myTIKR uses ticker tapes displaying
real-time data crawling horizontally for each app, with multiple tracks stacked
on top of each other, comprising a full-screen matrix snapshot of the user’s
most used apps. 
The user glances down at his phone
and sees all desired app content moving slowly in real-time across the screen,
and then taps a finger on the scrolling graphic or text hyperlink icon to view
the full-sized native content. Once finished with viewing that particular
content, one swipe takes the user back to the scrolling app matrix
dashboard. myTIKR is an app aggregator that brings all your social feeds
and content streams together into a simple, elegant, and customizable
application across all your digital devices.
Cheers, my name is Brad Simpson. I am the creator of the
myTIKR application. With myTIKR, you can access, check and manage your
“always-on” apps with an elegant, customizable single dashboard screen
(currently patent-pending technology). I created myTIKR to solve a few problems
I was having with managing my smartphone application use. To date, there are
over 1.5 million applications available for download from Apple iTunes and
Google Play. On average, each smartphone user checks apps over 35 times a day,
spending over 30 seconds per app. Whether or not we are ready to accept it, we
now live in a society of “App-Addicted” people controlled by their “Most Used”
apps. For me, having so many apps made my phone (and me) slow and inefficient.

	Diamond Nano Shield Clear 5 ml will protect approximately 4 square Ft of glass,<br/></p>
<p>
	 </p>
<h4>
	How long does it last?</h4>
<p>
	Depends upon the age of the surface and level of exposure to environmental conditions. Typically 2-3 years in most conditions.</p>
<p>
	 </p>

<p>
	 </p>
<h4>
	Does the surface need to be cleaned prior to application?</h4>
<p>
	Yes. Surface preparation is important to obtain maximum effects. A 
special glass cleaner is available (Quartz-Clean) and cleaning 
instructions are provided with each purchase.</p>
<p>
	 </p>
<h4>
	What if the surface has already been marked or stained?</h4>
<p>

 clean off), the damaged areas will need to be repaired before Diamond Nano Shield Coat 
Clear can be applied.</p>
<p>
	 </p>
<h4>
	Is an aftercare program needed?</h4>
<p>
	Treated glass becomes easy to clean, NOT self cleaning. Regular wiping 
with a wet microfibre cloth is all you need. Avoid the use of harsh 
chemical cleaners on the glass or ceramic surfaces as this may reduce 
the lifetime of the product, and are not needed to clean the treated 
glass or ceramic surface.</p>
<p>

<p>The commitment to Hercules PalmTop began in early 2014. Hercules evaluated all available base boards and dropped the idea of stick PCs, because the HDMI connector wasn’t firm enough with all connectors in use.</p>
<p>The chip sets available to the market were changing so rapidly and after Baytrail proved disappointing in both performance, Hercules Computing decided to wait for the sample run of Cherry Trail.</p>
<p>Combinations of integrated connectors were also limitless, but the optimum configuration was brought to the current Hercules PalmTop.</p>

Please consider this as an technical example to show how much heavy desktop applications can be used on your mobile devices through Hercules PalmTop for an urgent tasks. A Smartphone Running Desktop Version Powerpoint via Hercules PalmTop iPAD Running Desktop Version Photoshop via Hercules PalmTopDemonstration : iPAD - Photoshop by using a Third-party Remote Desktop ControlDemonstration : iPhone - Photoshop by using a Third-party Remote Desktop ControlSpecificationWho Needs Hercules PalmTop
The Development




The commitment to Hercules PalmTop began in early 2014. Hercules evaluated all available base boards and dropped the idea of stick PCs, because the HDMI connector wasn’t firm enough with all connectors in use.
The chip sets available to the market were changing so rapidly and after Baytrail proved disappointing in both performance, Hercules Computing decided to wait for the sample run of Cherry Trail.
Combinations of integrated connectors were also limitless, but the optimum configuration was brought to the current Hercules PalmTop.



The housing design also had a huge number of possibilities - from square, vertical / horizontal rectangles. Horizontal rectangle had the most stable position when installed on a table with wires, and has become the final design.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hillcrest High School (Midvale, UT, USA) started a robotics program to develop interest in science, technology, engineering, and math. Part of that effort was to create a team to compete in the FIRST Robotics Competition (see usfirst.org). This is an international  high-school level competition.  At our regional event, our rookie team was honored with the Rookie All-Star award for being the rookie team that best exemplified what FIRST is about, including gracious professionalism.  Part of that award was an invitation to the national/world championship in St. Louis, MO.   </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>To help get us there, we are trying to raise $25,000 in the short three weeks we have until nationals. We are also looking for long-term goals to be able to establish a permanent presence in our community by building robotics programs at our local middle and elementary schools. We were honored with a start-up grant from NASA and our district, the Canyons School District, but want to develop a self-sustaining program. We are looking both for help to get to nationals and help to start building our future.</p>
<p>We have several sponsorship programs that come with various levels of acknowledgements. The levels are Friend, Associate, Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, and Diamond. All levels are gratefully appreciated.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>FIRST robotics in general, and our robotics team specifically, are all about developing skills in students that will serve them in their adult lives.  Part of that is learning all aspects of an engineering project from start to finish.  This means that our team is comprised of engineering, programming, manufacturing, business, marketing, graphics, and media students as well as students from other disciplines.  We seek to engender partnerships with professional engineers and college professors to mentor the team. We seek to mentor other teams and sponsor elementary teams.</p>
<p>This program also seeks to find those students who might not otherwise be exposed to robotics, but for whom this field may prove to be choice.  Our school's demographics are varied by all metrics such as economic or racial diversity.  You could change the course of the life of one such child.</p>

<h1>Developers</h1>
<p>O6 provides an open-API platform to send and receive data and commands to its sensors and actuators. Open Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) APIs along with reference iOS code will be provided to integrate O6 directly with your apps or devices such as VR Headsets, Home automation controls, Toys, Car, among others. O6's open-APIs are only visible (exposed) to those devices that first pair with O6. O6’s APIs are not visible during standard advertising.</p>
<p>O6's APIs are exposed as custom BLE services such as Tactile State Service, Accelerometer Service, Haptic service and more, each with an unique Service and Characteristic UUIDs. The haptic motor can play a series of up to 8 distinct waveforms or time delays accessible through APIs to play complex and rich haptic effects in real time. O6 supports a library of 123 Haptic efforts, and complex haptic effects can be easily generated by combining waverforms that can be triggered in real-time. Documentation for developers will be provided during shipment of O6.</p>

Open Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) APIs along with reference iOS code will be provided to integrate O6 directly with your apps or devices such as VR Headsets, Home automation controls, Toys, Car, among others. O6's open-APIs are only visible (exposed) to those devices that first pair with O6. O6’s APIs are not visible during standard advertising.
O6's APIs are exposed as custom BLE services such as Tactile State Service, Accelerometer Service, Haptic service and more, each with an unique Service and Characteristic UUIDs. The haptic motor can play a series of up to 8 distinct waveforms or time delays accessible through APIs to play complex and rich haptic effects in real time. O6 supports a library of 123 Haptic efforts, and complex haptic effects can be easily generated by combining waverforms that can be triggered in real-time. Documentation for developers will be provided during shipment of O6.

Prototypes and timeline
We have spent over 2 years building our prototypes, and now are ready to take the next step to mass-manufacture O6 and bring them to you. We have working prototypes and a manufacturing partner lined up to help us make O6. Our target is to ship O6 by May 2017.
 
O6 early prototypes and current unit
April 2017 - Start of Production to build 3000 units.

We will also be adding exciting new software features to O6, including cloud-based hi-fidelity text-to-speech narration and hyperlink resolution. Backers will be able to vote and choose the priority of adding new content feeds as channels, such as Slack, Yelp, Reddit, Medium, Pocket, Instapaper, Documents, Wordpress, Tumblr, Facebook, Evernote, LinkedIn, or any of your other favorite websites and apps. And if your content includes hyperlinks, the app will automatically fetch and extract the content to audio or convert it to speech for a seamless experience.The possibilities are endless so we will focus on the most important features and on delivering O6 on time.

FAQ
1. How do I connect my O6 to the iPhone?
O6 connects to your iPhone via Bluetooth. After charging O6, please press any button on O6 and O6 will show up as ""Pair with O6"" under Bluetooth Setting. Tap on the prompt ""Pair with O6"" to connect and you are all set.
2. Does O6 support Android?
O6 currently only supports only iOS (eg iPhone, iPad, iPod) devices. Android is still in the works so please stay tuned.
3. What languages does O6 support?
O6 currently supports 27 languages.
The supported languages are as follows: Arabic, Chinese, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hindi, Hungarian, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Slovak, Spanish, Swedish, Thai, and Turkish.
4. How is O6 different from Apple Siri or other Voice Command Systems?
The primary purpose of O6 is not to quickly answer questions or set timers. It is to do with the the complex interactions and browsing that we now do every single day with our phones. On average, iPhone users open their phones 80 times a day. This is not generally to look up specific questions or set a timer. We open our phones to check-in, on email or social media. This is the problem O6 solves. O6 is far more reliable, interactive, and usable than Voice Command Systems can ever be.
5. Does O6 have a speaker?
No, the O6 does not have a speaker. O6 app stream audio via Bluetooth to Bluetooth speakers, Bluetooth earbuds, and car audio systems.
6. What is the Battery Life on the O6?
O6 typically lasts 5-7 days on normal use.
7. Where can I use O6?
You can use O6 while driving, outdoors or while walking or running, or at home.
8. How is O6 eyes free when the video shows the app while driving?
We show the app in the video to demonstrate the connection between the O6 device and the app. In practice, we expect the driver to use the app without looking because of speech feedback. The app works in the background and even when the phone is locked.
9. My question is not answered here. Where can I write to get my question answered?
You can reach us at hello@fingertipslab.com if you have a question.",19.0,3,"1 Campaign

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Alcoholipedia.com is your online Libation Information Station! We have thousands of pages covering just about anything and everything related to alcohol. Some of the categories on our site include: Drinking Games, Drink Recipes, Liquor and DUI Laws, Alcohol Quotes, Alcohol Facts, Hangover Cures, and even a map of every brewpub and brewery in the entire United States! Most of these categories have at least 100 entries and some have over 1000. The site is filled with everything you have ever wanted to know about booze, and even some stuff you probably didn't want to know. We have begun developing the most important portion of the site, the mobile app. Once this is complete you can access all of this information and more for free while you are out at the bar, or a wedding, or a football game, or wherever! We are a 100% wind powered and employee owned company and everything we do for you and the rest of the world is and will always be FREE!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The project you will be funding is our Blood Alcohol Content Calculator Mobile App. There are other BAC Apps on the market but ours is different, and dare we say.... better! Our proprietary formula for determining BAC along with our innovative methods and groundbreaking databases make our BAC Calculator the most accurate, fun, easy to use, and easy to integrate BAC Calculator in the world today. The possibilities are endless! And we have big plans for the calculator and for our contributors once we are fully online.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The code for our project does not currently exist. There is nothing remotely close to this on the market today. We have the best app, database, and website programmers in the world lined up and ready to make this totally awesome dream become a totally awesome reality. All we need is your support! Just so you know the specifics; 30K goes toward app development and design, 15K to database and website integration and compatibility coding, and the 5K will go to cover fees and to help pay for all of your awesome perks! Once the app is operational the basic version will be free to the world but will contain advertisements. The ad free premium version will cost a little money. But its important to note that all of you who contribute more than $10 will receive full access to the most advanced version of the app in addition to the other perks listed below. You will also have full access to the first versions of the app before it is released into the hot hands of the world. So grab a bottle o' rum and hop on board with us. I promise that you will be glad that you did.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Please check out our website! This is the next big thing and you are able to view it and use it pre launch! We have done zero advertising, and zero marketing in for the site thus far. You are among the first to be able to view and use the site. Enjoy it! Once the mobile app is finished we will begin advertising and opening up Alcoholipedia to the rest of the world. And then its off to the races. In the meantime please tell your friends and family about the site and the BAC Calculator app and please let us know what we can do better.

 How do you measure lumens? I see all of your products range quite high 
but most companies measure at the light source (1mm away)...so how to 
compare with working distance?<br/><br/><b>A:</b> Lumens are a measure of 
total light output, not the light intensity at a specific distance. We 
are reporting the total amount of light output from the LEDs themselves,
 inside the light chamber, prior to the diffusion technology.<br/><br/>If 
you buy an LED light bulb in any regular store you will see a Lumens 
rating (not lux). We think this is the best rating method to use for our
 lights because it is the most common, and is the best understood by the
 average consumer. If you know how bright a ""60 watt"" 800 Lumen LED bulb
 you bought at Wal-Mart is, you can probably make a reasonable inference
 about a higher Lumen rating. <br/><br/>You are probably seeing some other
 LED manufacturers use a Lux measurement which needs to include a 
specific distance. Lux more or less tells you how intense a light beam 
is at a specific point, at a specific distance. I'm not sure why some 
manufacturers use this measurement, but it doesn't really tell you a 
lot. A very narrow beam of light (e.g., a flashlight could have a very 
high lux, but low lumens). I highly doubt you would want to use a 
flashlight to light your subject though. <br/><br/>One of the reasons our 
LEDNatural technology is so special is precisely because our technology 
has a 120 degree coverage area, whereas, most traditional LED panels 
only have a 60 degree coverage area. In this scenario, a 60 degree LED 
light panel could conceivably measure higher on a Lux reading than a 
panel with a 120 degree area of coverage, but actually put out less 
light (Lumens). Hope some of this makes sense.<br/><br/>In short, its apples to oranges. We choose to report the more common measure of LED brightness.</p><p>

<ul>
<li>We decided on the name after a long process of finding a name that was meaningful, short and easy to remember. </li>
<li>In english, Huugga has a visual kinship with <b>Huge (time saver)</b>. We think that: ""If Huugga is used worldwide, together we can save millions of minutes around the world. These minutes without Huugga are spent daily searching."" </li>
<li>In spanish, Huugga has a phonetic relationship to spanish word: <b>Juega </b><b>(Play in English).</b> We like this phonetic similarity because  because Huugga will use gamification techniques to make the search process more fun.</li>
<li>For us, Huugga is synonymous with <b>Hottest guide </b>(about seaches). Because it allows quick access to frequently historical research and the hottest searches of the day or week.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/778294/files/20140810120909-Huge-Juega-Hot.png?1407697749"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

</div><div><b>Thanks!</b></div></div>","What is Huugga?




Huugga is a new way to search and find with 3 clicks or taps.
Huugga is a touch interface for search engines.





What are the advantages & benefits?



Accelerates the searches on PCs, Macs, Android and iOS!

Provides quick access to the latest hot topics!


Simplifies comparisons between the hottest!

Makes searches more fun!


How Huugga works?

Here's an example. Suppose you are looking for Angelina Jolie*. With a tradicional search you´ll have to type 15 times (13 letters, an space and the Enter key). 


*: Angelina Jolie has been at the top of searches during 70 months.With Huugga you only need 3 clicks on your PC/Mac or 3 taps on your mobile device. Easier! Faster! Huugga!


That means: ""With Huugga you skip the traditional search interface""






Why Huugga?



How we will invest the funds raised
A global development like Huugga has to face issues such as:


Expand the Team

Fast servers for Huugga website
Marketing, testing and online promotion tools

Translations, accounting, paperwork and legal issues






Goals and Languages 

If total funds raised reach 25,000 USD: we will develop the English version. It will be available for Web and Android.
If total funds raised reach 45,000 USD: we will extend the English version to iOS. Also we will develop the Spanish version. It will be available for Web, Android and iOS.
If total funds raised reach 65,000 USD: we will develop the German version. It will be available for Web, Android and iOS.If total funds raised reach 85,000 USD: we will develop the French version. It will be available for Web, Android and iOS. 


 




Answers to most likely questions:



What Huugga mean?


We decided on the name after a long process of finding a name that was meaningful, short and easy to remember. 
In english, Huugga has a visual kinship with Huge (time saver). We think that: ""If Huugga is used worldwide, together we can save millions of minutes around the world. These minutes without Huugga are spent daily searching."" 
In spanish, Huugga has a phonetic relationship to spanish word: Juega (Play in English). We like this phonetic similarity because  because Huugga will use gamification techniques to make the search process more fun.
For us, Huugga is synonymous with Hottest guide (about seaches). Because it allows quick access to frequently historical research and the hottest searches of the day or week.





For years, big tech companies have tried to reach Google and they didn´t have success. Why do you think that happened?

We have researched a lot about this topic and we detected 5 important reasons. The main reason is that: 

""They have been doing the same as Google, in the same way as Google""

Conclusion: ""To be different you need to make something different""


What are the areas where it is possible to innovate in Search Engines World? There are 4 important areas:




Search Interface:  The way how users get in touch with the search engine. The search interfaces are based on a box where we type texts. That system is slow, borry and uncomfortable for the 2 billion users of phones and tablets.

WebBot: The software that inspects websites in the Web. Improve this area requires a lot of investment, resources and time. Google and Microsoft have been investing billions here. 

Rankings: The way in which results are ordered and displayed. Again, the major search engines, shows the results in the same way.

Business Model: The way that advertising is shown on the web and on mobile devices. And again, there is little innovation here, everyone does it in a very similar way.




Has Huugga plans to innovate in these 4 areas?

We have plans to innovate in 3 of these 4 areas. But now we need to focus on the search interface. 


With Huugga the above diagram will be as follows:









Why do you focus on search interface?Because now there are 2 Billion people with smartphones or tablets around the World.  All these people have several years of experience using icon-based touch interfaces. But when they need to search for information they are forced to return to the alphanumeric keypad.




Huugga looks like a game. It is? 


Yes! Huugga will use Gamification techniques. For example:  While you are looking for information you accumulate points, as in a game. Also, there will be levels to overcome, as in a game.






Also you can collect badges as you play, as in a game.  Thus, the search process will be more fun and more enjoyable.



By it self, it can make ""the difference""








Is there another way to make it happen?Yes, there is. You can share this information with your friends, contacts and followers using social buttons, which are at the top of this page.

<p></p>
<p>A year ago I demonstrated a document management system, developed and deployed several years earlier, to a friend of mine who owns a small business.</p>
<p>Her initial skeptical and reluctant attitude to take a look at it quickly changed to a full blown excitement. She could hardly wait to start using it.</p>
<p>In her business, she often needs to quickly find old invoices (Excel, PDF files) and pictures of items associated with those invoices.</p>
<p>She also needs to archive and classify <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">documents and photographs of physical items, sketches, whiteboard drawings using a smartphone when traveling abroad and where internet is often slow or </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">unreliable. </span></p>
<p>When the integrated App was developed, I found that taking a good picture while trying to hold the phone <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">steady and horizontally was a challenge. Clicking the shutter would sometimes produce out of focus pictures.</span></p>
<p>Designing a portable copy stand for a smartphone was an obvious next step. </p>
<p>Looking through several designs using 3D modeling techniques, I realized that it would be prohibitively expensive to manufacture them without a big upfront <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">order. That's when the idea of utilizing a selfie stick placed in a ""brick"" was born. After all, many people already have a selfie stick - a simple accessory, the brick, turns the stick into a dual purpose item.  Not being as rigid as a copy stand, the stick could not prevent shaking caused by clicking, the Augmented Reality buttons solved the problem.</span></p>

<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Scan large objects, (i.e. newspapers, books, paintings), that don't fit into regular flatbed scanners</span><br/>
</li>
<li>No need to put a book upside down and/or press the lid to hold the book and potentially break the book's spine as can happen when using a flatbed scanner</li>
<li>You can sit at your desk instead of standing and holding the phone to maintain distance between the phone and the desk</li>
<li>Not touching the phone prevents out of focus images due to hand shaking</li>
<li>No need to constantly reorient the phone to prevent distorted or cropped images </li>
<li>Leaves your hands free to do other things (i.e. flip pages in a natural way)</li>

Stretch Goal - Compact Edition
The Story

A year ago I demonstrated a document management system, developed and deployed several years earlier, to a friend of mine who owns a small business.
Her initial skeptical and reluctant attitude to take a look at it quickly changed to a full blown excitement. She could hardly wait to start using it.
In her business, she often needs to quickly find old invoices (Excel, PDF files) and pictures of items associated with those invoices.
She also needs to archive and classify documents and photographs of physical items, sketches, whiteboard drawings using a smartphone when traveling abroad and where internet is often slow or unreliable. 
When the integrated App was developed, I found that taking a good picture while trying to hold the phone steady and horizontally was a challenge. Clicking the shutter would sometimes produce out of focus pictures.
Designing a portable copy stand for a smartphone was an obvious next step. 
Looking through several designs using 3D modeling techniques, I realized that it would be prohibitively expensive to manufacture them without a big upfront order. That's when the idea of utilizing a selfie stick placed in a ""brick"" was born. After all, many people already have a selfie stick - a simple accessory, the brick, turns the stick into a dual purpose item.  Not being as rigid as a copy stand, the stick could not prevent shaking caused by clicking, the Augmented Reality buttons solved the problem.
SelfieBrick Benefits



Scan large objects, (i.e. newspapers, books, paintings), that don't fit into regular flatbed scanners

No need to put a book upside down and/or press the lid to hold the book and potentially break the book's spine as can happen when using a flatbed scanner
You can sit at your desk instead of standing and holding the phone to maintain distance between the phone and the desk
Not touching the phone prevents out of focus images due to hand shaking
No need to constantly reorient the phone to prevent distorted or cropped images 
Leaves your hands free to do other things (i.e. flip pages in a natural way)

Works as fast as you flip pages



But why limit yourself to scanning?
You can point the Augmented Reality buttons at anything and have the App capture and send pictures automatically anywhere.
Examples of other use:

An overhead projector when used with Smart Personal Cloud locally or remotely
Door peephole camera motion sensor to automatically send/email pictures of any movement in front of it

Remotely controlled camera to take group/self pictures
While working (in a garage, backyard, kitchen) and having hands dirty/busy, take and send pictures without touching the phone to anywhere (for help, instructions, sharing)
Whiteboard drawings



How

 


When using a smartphone to take pictures of documents, people often face two challenges/problems:


Keeping the phone parallel to the document's surface and thus preventing distorted or skewed images

Holding the phone steady when pressing the shutter button, as tapping the phone may result in out of focus images


The SelfieBrick solves the first problem, while the App, with its Augmented Reality buttons solves the second.  In addition, the App provides numerous benefits that further simplify scanning, such as automatically converting images into single or multi-page PDF files, emailing or uploading them into the proper folder of one of the public cloud services (i.e. Dropbox), or multi-category classification when used with the Smart Personal Cloud system for which the App was originally designed.
When used with the Smart Personal Cloud, the App can automate a number of time consuming tasks. For example, when doing a comparative market research of a product, people often make bookmarks of similar products to create a list of candidates (Web pages) for a final review later. Instead of multi-step process and time consuming bookmark search, the App uses a single swipe to copy the Web page, assign categories and store it in the database. All this without leaving the page!  
Just like scanning books naturally, browsing the Web and saving pages in dedicated groups, is easy and natural. 


Selfie stick compatibility
Any Selfie stick (i.e. ReTrak) with the diameter of the handle at the bottom 3/4"" (19 mm) is compatible.

The App


Using patent-pending technology, the App can monitor ""hot"" areas defined by the position of the Augmented Reality Buttons relative to the pointed at image. Whether it is a desk below or a group of people doing a selfie snapshot at a distance, the change within the ""hot"" area will trigger the corresponding action (a snapshot or a file upload, email, classification).

FAQ
1)  Great idea! Is there an iPhone version coming soon?


Yes, the iPhone version is being investigated/prototyped and may be added as a Stretch Goal, if the campaign goal is reached.


2)  Is the idea of a SelfieBrick and Augmented Reality buttons patent protected?

Yes, several patents are pending.






Risks & Challenges
 The technology works (tested on the Samsung Galaxy S4 and S5 smartphones), but it needs more tests and optimization using a larger variety of Android phones, networks, usage patterns and cloud services.
The funds will be used to manufacture the SelfieBricks and hire Software Engineers.

 
Other Ways You Can Help
Even if you can't make a donation, you can contribute. You can tell all of your family, friends, and colleagues about the SelfieBrick project by sharing the campaign on social media.

<p>ACUI was born a few months ago from our disappointment for the

their Android smartphone as a media center on their cars. <span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">Armed with enthusiasm and patience, we then started developing an
application which would satisfy our needs in regards of aesthetics

<p> In order to describe what ACUI is we need to describe the four types

and two or more themes and they all designed to match everyone’s
tastes.</p><p></p><ul>
<li>ACUI Tab Set: This is our original project, a set of four different UIs designed to be used on devices with screens of 6” or more.<br/>

<li>ACUI Moto Set: A set of four apps designed to be used by motorcycle riders. This is a different case, in fact there are many ways to place a smartphone on a motorcycle’s handlebar, which is why our apps will be developed while focusing on three main factors: device placement on the handlebar, device orientation, and the hand used.</li>
</ul><p></p>

<p>We have developed two solutions in case you want to place your device
at the center of the handlebar.</p>
<p>
First solution requires the use of just one hand and a horizontally
placed device, this app will be released both for right-handed or
left-handed use ( pictures refer to the left-handed version).</p>
<p>On the other hand,
the second solution allows you to use your device with both hands, in
this case the device can be placed either horizontally or vertically.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/428437/files/20140312084352-Side_RightLeftHands_Horizontal.png?1394639032"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/428438/files/20140312084359-Side_RightLeftHands_Vertical.png?1394639039"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><p>

<p>If
IBOX can only be used as a mini PC and Android TV
BOX, it does not have any advantages
over other TV boxes in the
market indeed. Therefore, here we would like to introduce the
differences between it and
other boxes in more detail:</p>
<p>IBOX
can support multimedia functions that
other TV boxes support by adding with appropriate ROM. While compared to other TV boxes with closed properties, IBOX offers more freedom so that you can use various versions of
firmware easily, including
Android and various versions of linux
in both NAND FLASH version and
SD card version to meet your
special requirements .</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/406990/files/20140303074303-ROM.png?1393861383"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p></p><p><i style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">*<a href=""http://blog.iteadstudio.com/operating-systems-support-a1020-core-list/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Click here to download address of ROMs</a></i></p><p></p><p>In
addition to more choices in
software, IBOX offers an expansion interface to facilitate future expansion of
various types of functions. With this interface, it can realize a variety of functions that other TV boxes cannot by adding all kinds
of hardware modules externally. For
example, as mentioned above:
after an external data
acquisition card is added, data
accosted can be sent to IBOX via the expansion interface, and then
application running on IBOX will
analyze and display the data, thus realizes functions of
a virtual instrument.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/406992/files/20140303074345-iboxkz.jpg?1393861425"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p>
<p>Hardware
pins on expansion interface are
defined as follows :</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/494444/files/20140408195422-ibox32pinr_1_.gif?1397012062"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Expansion
interface provides most of the commonly-used buses which are operated via direct drive of ITEAD OS SDK, thus users are free to make various self-development.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">With open-source hardware and software design as well
as development based on ITEAD A20 core board, IBOX can be easily upgraded by
replacing the master control. To upgrade A20 from A10, simply open the box,
then remove the A10 core board and replace it with A20 core board. For future
A31 and other more powerful CPU modules, it also support upgrading by way of
plugging - of course, due to its open property, you can even plug in a CPU core
board customized according to your own needs.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/406897/files/20140303065023-IMG_0067.JPG?1393858223"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/408796/files/20140303224949-SHIPPING.gif?1393915789"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We guarantee that, once this
campaign is ended, you will get an intact IBOX and a development extension

<p>With regard to
software, IBOX will be pre-installed with Android system of NAND
FLASH version
when leaving the factory. Moreover, we will provide the linux
operating system that works on it, and you can download and install on your own when needed. Apart from the
operating system, all the other applications mentioned
above are temporarily not in our development schedule, thus we can
not guarantee that there are ready-made hardware extensions and
applications to
transform IBOX directly into an oscilloscope or an infrared repeater
controller when
you have it -
although it does

someone needs to

<h2>USB Connector for Portability</h2>
<div>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Did you know iSensor HD uses USB for its power and WiFi for its internet? Just look at all the places you can use it!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>First off, it can be wall or ceiling mounted anywhere in the house with the included bracket. </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/758760/files/20140801025455-IMG_0404.JPG?1406886895"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p>Or plug it into a USB power adapter and make it cordless!</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/758761/files/20140801025547-IMG_0422.JPG?1406886947"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p>The back of the iSensor HD can be manually rotated 90° for when the electric socket is near the ground. Here you can remotely 'tilt' 180° instead of 'panning'!</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/758766/files/20140801025757-IMG_0394.JPG?1406887077"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>You can even plug it into a portable USB power bank and carry it around the house! In this method, where ever you have WiFi you can place the iSensor!</p>

<h2>How Do I Control the Camera?</h2>
<div><br/></div>
<p></p>
<p> For all platforms, you can simply send Skype messages (L,R) to move the camera left or right. For Android devices, there are two more ways to do it. You can swipe the screen to move the camera (as the demo video shows below) or you can tilt the phone to move the camera. For iOS devices, both texting and tilting work well with that platform.</p>
<p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2Fvi7euwwkaYU%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dvi7euwwkaYU&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2Fvi7euwwkaYU%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p>

<h2>Skype Push Alert</h2>
<div><br/></div>
<p></p>
<p>iSensor HD has built-in audio and motion sensors. Once triggered, it will automatically send you push text or push picture alerts. You can also customize your device name. For example, I have re-named mine as ""iBabi Azure"" as shown below. The push message includes a time stamp, so you know exactly when the alert was triggered. Simply press the alert icon to download the picture at your command.</p>

<h4 style=""font-weight: bold; text-align: center;""></h4>
<p>Skype allows us to bring you the industry leading <b>256-bit encryption</b> on all of the iSensor HD's audio and video transmissions! Other companies often use unknown 3rd party servers that offer as little as 32-bit encryption. This low level of security renders them easily able to be hacked, as had happened to two major companies in the summer of 2013.</p>
<p>In addition, Skype software employs dynamic video channeling. This automatically adjusts the video quality according to the internet connection, always ensuring there is <b>less than 0.5 seconds </b>of delay and giving true real time communication.</p>

</h3>
<div><br/></div>
<h3>
<b>1. Most compact panning HD IP camera available</b> </h3>
<p>With its tiny size and super low power consumption, you can even plug it into a power bank for portable use!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3><b>2. Free 15 GB of online storage </b></h3>
<p>We charge NO subscription fees, other companies usually charge up to $200 per year!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3><b>3. 256-bit encryption</b></h3>
<p> Other companies simply can't afford to have the same level of encryption, that's why we leverage Skype's encryption technology to bring you by far the highest security in the home IP camera industry!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3><b>4. Skype's worldwide P2P servers provide real-time video/audio</b></h3>
<p>Through the use of Skype's massive P2P network, users will have less than 0.5 seconds of delay anywhere in the world. Other products suffer from servers being based in one geographic location and can experience severely long delays depending on location.</p>

The Most Trusted Home Security Camera! It's also the World's Smallest Too.





Amaryllo International


Please watch our introduction video below and meet the team!





The iSensor HD is a modular, self-installed, home security system that runs all of its communications through Skype. It is a small and unimposing security device that can be mounted on walls, ceilings, or even set atop a desk. 
Several sensors can be added around your home or small office, all connecting through Skype to your phone or tablet. Offering up to 1280 x 720 HD quality in real-time, the iSensor HD aims to bring the ease of self-installation and the ultra-high level of Skype's 256-bit encryption to the home security market!

Come check us out on Facebook, Twitter and our Amaryllo website!




Featuring


 








Super Compact

iSensor HD is slightly shorter than the iPhone 5. With a built-in motor and gears, iSensor HD is the world's smallest and lightest high definition IP camera that offers over 180 degrees of viewing. Powered by a standard 5 volt and 1 amp supply, iSensor HD is also the world's lowest power-consuming high definition IP camera with a panning feature. 






iSensor HD in action!







USB Connector for Portability


Did you know iSensor HD uses USB for its power and WiFi for its internet? Just look at all the places you can use it!

First off, it can be wall or ceiling mounted anywhere in the house with the included bracket. 


Or plug it into a USB power adapter and make it cordless!


The back of the iSensor HD can be manually rotated 90° for when the electric socket is near the ground. Here you can remotely 'tilt' 180° instead of 'panning'!




You can even plug it into a portable USB power bank and carry it around the house! In this method, where ever you have WiFi you can place the iSensor!

Even connect it to your computer or laptop to guard your desk at work!







How Do I Control the Camera?


 For all platforms, you can simply send Skype messages (L,R) to move the camera left or right. For Android devices, there are two more ways to do it. You can swipe the screen to move the camera (as the demo video shows below) or you can tilt the phone to move the camera. For iOS devices, both texting and tilting work well with that platform.


The video below shows how to remotely control different Amaryllo products (such as iBabi HD) with all 3 different ways.









Skype Push Alert


iSensor HD has built-in audio and motion sensors. Once triggered, it will automatically send you push text or push picture alerts. You can also customize your device name. For example, I have re-named mine as ""iBabi Azure"" as shown below. The push message includes a time stamp, so you know exactly when the alert was triggered. Simply press the alert icon to download the picture at your command.








Why Skype?




Skype allows us to bring you the industry leading 256-bit encryption on all of the iSensor HD's audio and video transmissions! Other companies often use unknown 3rd party servers that offer as little as 32-bit encryption. This low level of security renders them easily able to be hacked, as had happened to two major companies in the summer of 2013.
In addition, Skype software employs dynamic video channeling. This automatically adjusts the video quality according to the internet connection, always ensuring there is less than 0.5 seconds of delay and giving true real time communication.





Amaryllo in the News








""The iCam is every IP camera owners dream. It’s easy to setup, has 256-bit encryption, supports 1080 x 720 video without lag-time, and free cloud service. Then there are the little things like no contracts, no monthly fees, and a rocking Android app."" - SecurityGem (iCam HD)



""Your best bet would presumably be to use one that’s actually designed for – and licensed by – Skype."" -  Gizmag


""Simply connect via Skype and watch what’s going on in your home from your smartphone."" - City A.M.

""An internet-accessible real-time monitor/alarm for infants, pets, home security or other applications."" - PanTech Solutions
""[The setup was] simple, straightforward"" - Techno Traveler ""This cam is styled to fit in nicely on a kid’s shelf, rotates 360 and tilts up and down, and integrates with Skype. Plus, it’s adorable when it moves around."" - CES 2014 Blog (iCam HD)
""The Amaryllo iCam separated itself from the crowd."" - Linux.com (iCam HD)
""It’s a wireless baby monitor that I wish was around when my babies were in cribs!"" - Blue Suit Mom (iBabi HD)


Recognition & Awards


Amaryllo was selected as a Cool Vendor by Gartner in their Connected Home Report 2014. Gartner is the world's biggest investment research company.





 Amaryllo was also the recipient of 2 prestigious awards at Computex 2014. The iSensor HD was the top winner of the Best Choice Award in the ""SmarTech"" category.
















Design Patents

We have filed close to 20 patents in our design and innovation.  Shown below is iSensor HD's industry design patent granted by 26 European countries.

 



Why Choose iSensor HD?



1. Most compact panning HD IP camera available 
With its tiny size and super low power consumption, you can even plug it into a power bank for portable use!

2. Free 15 GB of online storage 
We charge NO subscription fees, other companies usually charge up to $200 per year!

3. 256-bit encryption
 Other companies simply can't afford to have the same level of encryption, that's why we leverage Skype's encryption technology to bring you by far the highest security in the home IP camera industry!


4. Skype's worldwide P2P servers provide real-time video/audio
Through the use of Skype's massive P2P network, users will have less than 0.5 seconds of delay anywhere in the world. Other products suffer from servers being based in one geographic location and can experience severely long delays depending on location.





HD Video Quality at Google Drive
Below is a snapshot of a recorded 1280 x 720 HD video at our assembling site. 



By clicking here, you can see the actual recorded audio and video from Google Drive. You can hear and see crystally clear sound and HD video.




Picture Quality

Here's a shot of the iSensor HD's 1280 x 720 taken live on Skype from a computer all the way across the world (the far wall is about 20 meters away). The image keeps its integrity without visual distortion.


Here's a shot of one of the competitor's HD cameras inside a small office (notice the strange curvature of their industry standard fish eye lens):





Comparison








Industry leading 256-bit encryption


Through Skype, the iSensor HD features 256-bit encryption, which is the highest found in the IP camera home security market. Be sure that no uninvited stranger will ever be looking in on your home, as had happened to other IP camera companies in the Summer of 2013.

Free  15 GB of Online Storage on Google Drive



Did we mention that there is a built-in memory to automatically upload recorded videos to your Google Drive account after setup? Did we mention that it is a FREE cloud storage service?  Amaryllo is the first security company to offer free online storage on Google Drive for all of its products! Simply enter in your Google account details and choose which kind of recording format you want. After that you can access your videos from anywhere in the world...at no additional charge!

Sleek and Stylish Design




iSensor HD comes in all white or all black. It can fit seamlessly inside any home or office while offering peace of mind without distraction.


Hand Motion Controlled Remote Panning

Our patent pending technology allows the user to call into the camera through Skype and remotely pan the sensor by tilting the smartphone left and right!

See Everything in Your Home

Being mounted on a wall or ceiling and with 180° of panning plus the lens angle of 60° makes sure the user can see everything in the room from anywhere in the world!
Audio and Motion Triggered Picture Alerts


All iSensor HD's come with built-in audio and video sensors to catch thieves in the act! The iSensor HD will send either a Skype picture or text alert to your phone as soon as the action takes place.Up to 1280 x 720 HD

With the 1.0 MP lens of the iSensor HD, the user can see all of the action going on in crystal clear imaging. Amaryllo's products also feature dynamic channel adjustment. This will automatically adjust the video quality according to the internet connection, always ensuring a delay of less than 0.5 seconds, giving you true real time communication! Other products on the market can have lag time up to several minutes, making two-way communication almost impossible.Intruder Warning Light
iSensor HD comes with a super bright white LED light for use at night time. This is the same type that is found in the iPhone 5s. The user can easily control the function of the light inside the iSensor HD app.Privacy Mode

 All of Amaryllo's products have a built-in privacy mode function that can be turned on or off from anywhere in the world via the app. If you do not want anyone else calling into the camera, or want to turn off all the detecting and recording, simply turn on privacy mode. This will rotate the camera to the side and shut off all transmissions, as well as change the sensor's Skype status to 'Do not disturb.'

<p>We are a team of three German engineers from
Berlin who love new and creative technology. Ringo and Kai worked several years
in a company for industrial automation. There they had built production machines, robots
and camera detection systems and installed them in different countries around
the world. Jonas on the other hand is currently finishing his studies of Business
and Engineering and is now helping us to communicate our project.</p>
<br/><br/><h5 style=""text-align: center;"">     Our goal is to create a robotic platform that everyone can use <br/><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: initial;"">and is compatible to existing systems, like <a href=""http://cagebot.com/wp-content/uploads/revslider/upgrades1/android1.jpg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">LEGO Mindstorms</a>.</span>
</h5>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>We are frustrated with the solutions on the market. If you are a 
technology enthusiast like us, but don't have the time to learn 
everything from the beginning you won't find any product that will 
satisfy you.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h5 style=""text-align: center;"">You can build whatever you have in mind.</h5>
<p><br/></p>
In order to accomplish this, we created very special bricks, so there is no limit in creation.
<p>You can build whatever you have in mind and will get a very stable structure that won't bend on your needs. Several creations are possible. You can create for instance robots, 3D printers, bridges, towers, buildings or you build just your own small fully automated factory. On top, we created a software that is easy to understand and will satisfy very fast, without a long manual to read. Check it out!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h5 style=""text-align: center;"">
<b>There are no limits for your creativity!</b>
</h5>
<p><br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Our easy-to-use software does not have any limits, even for advanced users. We are using the Arduino<b>®</b> Software Platform to support a growing and really awesome community. You will get help with your own ideas and you can spread yours to support others. It is a very satisfying experience.<br/>And on top of that you could still work with our windows, mac, android or future iOS software to control and set up your creation.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<h4 style=""text-align: center;""><b>To make this a reality we need your help!</b></h4>

After 3 years of research and development we now have fully functional prototypes in our hand. We are currently a small start up with limited capacities to finance production runs. With your support we will be able to produce our whole product range and to deliver complete sets to your homes for the first time. Additionally, you will speed up further research and development for even more fun and excitement in the future. It is you who can support us in doing so! It is you who enables us to deliver adventure and education to your home!<br/><br/><br/><h4 style=""text-align: center;""><b>Education means future! <br/></b></h4>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b><b>By supporting us you will invest in the future of many people, not 
only in our project! </b>Our goal is to support as many people as possible 
with the chance to learn more about our modern world and the technology within it.<br/></b></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Be one of the first users of Cagebot! Our awesome perks will enable you to become one of the first users in a growing community. Conventional technology is short-lived and fast disposed of. We would like to introduce a system which is modular and can be
 used even after years.

<br/>We already invested in the development and trial run with all the necessary parts which are vital for our prototype. We have contracts with all the important partners for a longterm relationship and want to create many varieties of upgrades. Then we will start our online shop and hope people like our idea as much as we do. We will ask you guys regularly what you need for your creations. All this will be available as upgrades, so you won't need to buy the same stuff again.</div>

<p>During our search for components we found the best electronics, like the most useful sensors and most powerful motors. If you have your own hardware, we offer you the possibility to acquire the single components you still need. Until now there is no sensor like ours on the market. With this reasonable price you will get a bus system ready sensor with a lot of functions.<br/></p>

<h3 align=""justify"" style=""text-align: center;""><b>Was ist Cagebot?</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p><span>                                                     Modular in allen Bereichen.</span></p>
<p><span>Cagebot ist ein modulares Robotik-System, mit dem du deine Vision der Zukunft verwirklichen kannst, und das schon heute. Steig ein in die futuristische Welt der Robotertechnik. Bei Cagebot erwarten dich eine Vielzahl modular aufgebauter Komponenten. Das heißt, sie können beliebig miteinander kombiniert werden und sind sogar mit anderen Systemen kompatibel. Motoren, Sensoren und Energiequellen werden zu Bausteinen deiner Ideen. Ob du ein vollautomatisches Chassis für Kamerafahrten entwickeln möchtest, ein Fernlenkauto oder einen intelligenten Staubsauger. Die Modularität sorgt dafür, dass am Ende alle Teile zu einer Einheit verschmelzen. Dann schnappst du dir PC, Tablet oder Smartphone und hauchst deinem Roboter Leben ein.</span></p>
<p><span><br/></span></p>
<p><span></span></p>
<h3>                               Benutzerfreundlich</h3>
<p><span>                                                        Vom Anfänger bis zum Profi. <br/></span></p>
<p><span>Uns, dem Cagebot-Team, war es besonders wichtig, dir den Einstieg so einfach wie möglich zu machen. Alle Komponenten können ohne Elektronikkenntnisse zusammengebaut und ohne Programmierkenntnisse gesteuert werden. Baue schon am ersten Tag deinen multifunktionalen Roboter. So entdeckst du spielerisch die Faszination dieser neuen Welt. Entwickle dich Schritt für Schritt weiter, um komplexere Projekte zu realisieren und mehr Kontrolle zu gewinnen. Hinter der benutzerfreundlichen Oberfläche von Cagebot verbirgt sich ein professionelles Robotiksystem, das im Advanced-Modus frei programmierbar ist. All dies wird kontinuierlich weiterentwickelt und mit euren Ideen, eurer Unterstützung und eurem Feedback sind Cagebot bald keine Grenzen mehr gesetzt.</span></p>
<p><span><br/></span></p>
Wir sind ein 3 Mann Team aus Berlin und lieben Neues und im speziellen besonders neue Technologien. Wir sind seit vielen Jahren in der Automatisierungsindustrie tätig, in welcher wir mit Produktionsmaschinen, Robotern und Kameras für Objekterkennung arbeiten. Unsere Arbeit führte uns um den ganzen Globus. <span><br/></span>Bei Jonas sieht es etwas anders aus, er ist beim Abschluss seines Studiums zum Wirtschaftsingenieur und hilft uns nun bei der Kommunikation unseres Projektes.</div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;""><br/></div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;"">
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>Unser Ziel ist eine modulare Roboterplattform, die jeder bedienen und nutzen kann, dazu noch kompatibel zu Systemen wie <a href=""http://cagebot.com/wp-content/uploads/revslider/upgrades1/android1.jpg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">LEGO Mindstorms</a> ist.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span></b></p>
<p>Wir waren auf der Suche nach einem System welches einfach bedienbar ist und jedem die Möglichkeit bietet komplexe Technologien in ein eigenes Robotersystem zu integrieren. Wenn Du ein Technikfan bist wie wir, aber nicht die Zeit hast alles vom Grunde auf zu lernen, dann wirst Du kein Produkt finden welches Dich befriedigt. <br/></p>
Um dies zu ändern kreierten wir spezielle Bausteine mit denen es keine Limitierung in den Möglichkeiten gibt.<br/>Baue was immer Dir auch in den Sinn kommt!<br/><p>Viele verschiedene Kreationen sind möglich. Du kannst Roboter, 3D Drucker, Brücken, Türme, Gebäude bauen oder Du baust Dir einfach Deine eigene kleine vollautomatische Fertigungsstrasse. Obendrauf kreierten wir eine Software die einfach zu verstehen und zu benutzen ist. Damit wirst Du schnelle Erfolge verzeichnen, ohne lange Anleitungen lesen zu müssen. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>                                 Es gibt kein Limit für Deine Kreativität!</b></p>
<p><br/></p>Bei einfach zu benutzender Software gibt es meistens Einschränkungen in den Anwendungen. Nicht mit unserer! Solltest Du weiter und mehr ins Detail gehen wollen, kein Problem! Wir benutzen die Arduino<b>®</b>
 Software Platform um das Wachstum einer herausragenden Gemeinde zu unterstützen. Diese kannst Du ebenfalls benutzen und die Systeme in der Dir bekannte Weise programmieren. <span><br/></span>Du wirst Unterstützung bei der Umsetzung Deiner Ideen erhalten. <br/><p>Natürlich kannst Du auch mit der Cagebot Windows, Mac, Android oder zukünftigen iOS Software arbeiten.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h4>         Um all dies möglich zu machen benötigen wir Deine Hilfe!</h4>

<br/>Wir verbrachten 3 Jahre mit der Entwicklung und nun haben wir voll funktionsfähige Prototypen. Derzeit sind wir ein kleines Start-Up mit limitierten finanziellen Kapazitäten. Mit eurer Unterstützung werden wir fähig sein die Produktion zu starten und euch fertige Sets nach Hause zu liefern. Zusätzlich werden zukünftige Entwicklungen beschleunigt. Dies verspricht noch mehr Spass für die Zukunft. <span><br/></span>Du bist es, der uns darin unterstützen kann! Du machst es möglich, dass wir mehr Abenteuer und Bildung bereitstellen können.</div>

Timeline

We are a team of three German engineers from
Berlin who love new and creative technology. Ringo and Kai worked several years
in a company for industrial automation. There they had built production machines, robots
and camera detection systems and installed them in different countries around
the world. Jonas on the other hand is currently finishing his studies of Business
and Engineering and is now helping us to communicate our project.
     Our goal is to create a robotic platform that everyone can use and is compatible to existing systems, like LEGO Mindstorms.



We are frustrated with the solutions on the market. If you are a 
technology enthusiast like us, but don't have the time to learn 
everything from the beginning you won't find any product that will 
satisfy you.

You can build whatever you have in mind.

In order to accomplish this, we created very special bricks, so there is no limit in creation.
You can build whatever you have in mind and will get a very stable structure that won't bend on your needs. Several creations are possible. You can create for instance robots, 3D printers, bridges, towers, buildings or you build just your own small fully automated factory. On top, we created a software that is easy to understand and will satisfy very fast, without a long manual to read. Check it out!


There are no limits for your creativity!




Our easy-to-use software does not have any limits, even for advanced users. We are using the Arduino® Software Platform to support a growing and really awesome community. You will get help with your own ideas and you can spread yours to support others. It is a very satisfying experience.And on top of that you could still work with our windows, mac, android or future iOS software to control and set up your creation.



To make this a reality we need your help!







After 3 years of research and development we now have fully functional prototypes in our hand. We are currently a small start up with limited capacities to finance production runs. With your support we will be able to produce our whole product range and to deliver complete sets to your homes for the first time. Additionally, you will speed up further research and development for even more fun and excitement in the future. It is you who can support us in doing so! It is you who enables us to deliver adventure and education to your home!Education means future! 

By supporting us you will invest in the future of many people, not 
only in our project! Our goal is to support as many people as possible 
with the chance to learn more about our modern world and the technology within it.

Be one of the first users of Cagebot! Our awesome perks will enable you to become one of the first users in a growing community. Conventional technology is short-lived and fast disposed of. We would like to introduce a system which is modular and can be
 used even after years.

How it works

 With the Motion Editor you can simply tell your Cagebot what to do.



You want Cagebot to paint for you? No problem!



A small demonstration of how solid are our bricks.


That will be the size of our Cagebot Starter Edition Kit.


                                                Stretch goals

If we reach our founding goal and above following stretch goals become available





On our way to the final product there are some steps.


First thing will be the molding forms and first batch of bricks. Second, we will start the printed circuit board production and third, we will do additional tests so we can deliver a satisfying product!
Furthermore, there are several certification goals to achieve, like CE or UL. 
We will use the money to start up our production line in Taiwan. We 
worked and lived there for a long time and are very close with this nation. For those, who are further interested in this country, please visithttp://www.lonelyplanet.com/taiwan


We already invested in the development and trial run with all the necessary parts which are vital for our prototype. We have contracts with all the important partners for a longterm relationship and want to create many varieties of upgrades. Then we will start our online shop and hope people like our idea as much as we do. We will ask you guys regularly what you need for your creations. All this will be available as upgrades, so you won't need to buy the same stuff again.




During our search for components we found the best electronics, like the most useful sensors and most powerful motors. If you have your own hardware, we offer you the possibility to acquire the single components you still need. Until now there is no sensor like ours on the market. With this reasonable price you will get a bus system ready sensor with a lot of functions.



Risks and Challenges



 

We tried to minimize the risk but our way is still full of challenges. The system is very complex and contains a lot of components and parts. We prepared ourselves as good as possible and we are quite confident to manage the coming obstacles together with our partners.
We are using Flexible Funding because even if we won't reach our funding goal we will start a small production line. We want to make our dream come true.
Even if you are not able to contribute money you can help us with sharing our idea/project with other people. You also can easily use the tool from indiegogo to share with others.

Neuigkeiten!Wir lassen gerade unsere Bausteinformen herstellen und können in etwa zwei Wochen mit der ersten Produktion unserer Bausteine starten. Es sieht gut für einen vorgezogenen Versandtermin aus.

Was ist Cagebot?

                                                     Modular in allen Bereichen.
Cagebot ist ein modulares Robotik-System, mit dem du deine Vision der Zukunft verwirklichen kannst, und das schon heute. Steig ein in die futuristische Welt der Robotertechnik. Bei Cagebot erwarten dich eine Vielzahl modular aufgebauter Komponenten. Das heißt, sie können beliebig miteinander kombiniert werden und sind sogar mit anderen Systemen kompatibel. Motoren, Sensoren und Energiequellen werden zu Bausteinen deiner Ideen. Ob du ein vollautomatisches Chassis für Kamerafahrten entwickeln möchtest, ein Fernlenkauto oder einen intelligenten Staubsauger. Die Modularität sorgt dafür, dass am Ende alle Teile zu einer Einheit verschmelzen. Dann schnappst du dir PC, Tablet oder Smartphone und hauchst deinem Roboter Leben ein.


                               Benutzerfreundlich
                                                        Vom Anfänger bis zum Profi. 
Uns, dem Cagebot-Team, war es besonders wichtig, dir den Einstieg so einfach wie möglich zu machen. Alle Komponenten können ohne Elektronikkenntnisse zusammengebaut und ohne Programmierkenntnisse gesteuert werden. Baue schon am ersten Tag deinen multifunktionalen Roboter. So entdeckst du spielerisch die Faszination dieser neuen Welt. Entwickle dich Schritt für Schritt weiter, um komplexere Projekte zu realisieren und mehr Kontrolle zu gewinnen. Hinter der benutzerfreundlichen Oberfläche von Cagebot verbirgt sich ein professionelles Robotiksystem, das im Advanced-Modus frei programmierbar ist. All dies wird kontinuierlich weiterentwickelt und mit euren Ideen, eurer Unterstützung und eurem Feedback sind Cagebot bald keine Grenzen mehr gesetzt.

Wir sind ein 3 Mann Team aus Berlin und lieben Neues und im speziellen besonders neue Technologien. Wir sind seit vielen Jahren in der Automatisierungsindustrie tätig, in welcher wir mit Produktionsmaschinen, Robotern und Kameras für Objekterkennung arbeiten. Unsere Arbeit führte uns um den ganzen Globus. Bei Jonas sieht es etwas anders aus, er ist beim Abschluss seines Studiums zum Wirtschaftsingenieur und hilft uns nun bei der Kommunikation unseres Projektes.


Unser Ziel ist eine modulare Roboterplattform, die jeder bedienen und nutzen kann, dazu noch kompatibel zu Systemen wie LEGO Mindstorms ist.
Wir waren auf der Suche nach einem System welches einfach bedienbar ist und jedem die Möglichkeit bietet komplexe Technologien in ein eigenes Robotersystem zu integrieren. Wenn Du ein Technikfan bist wie wir, aber nicht die Zeit hast alles vom Grunde auf zu lernen, dann wirst Du kein Produkt finden welches Dich befriedigt. 
Um dies zu ändern kreierten wir spezielle Bausteine mit denen es keine Limitierung in den Möglichkeiten gibt.Baue was immer Dir auch in den Sinn kommt!Viele verschiedene Kreationen sind möglich. Du kannst Roboter, 3D Drucker, Brücken, Türme, Gebäude bauen oder Du baust Dir einfach Deine eigene kleine vollautomatische Fertigungsstrasse. Obendrauf kreierten wir eine Software die einfach zu verstehen und zu benutzen ist. Damit wirst Du schnelle Erfolge verzeichnen, ohne lange Anleitungen lesen zu müssen. 

                                 Es gibt kein Limit für Deine Kreativität!
Bei einfach zu benutzender Software gibt es meistens Einschränkungen in den Anwendungen. Nicht mit unserer! Solltest Du weiter und mehr ins Detail gehen wollen, kein Problem! Wir benutzen die Arduino®
 Software Platform um das Wachstum einer herausragenden Gemeinde zu unterstützen. Diese kannst Du ebenfalls benutzen und die Systeme in der Dir bekannte Weise programmieren. Du wirst Unterstützung bei der Umsetzung Deiner Ideen erhalten. Natürlich kannst Du auch mit der Cagebot Windows, Mac, Android oder zukünftigen iOS Software arbeiten.

         Um all dies möglich zu machen benötigen wir Deine Hilfe!



Wir verbrachten 3 Jahre mit der Entwicklung und nun haben wir voll funktionsfähige Prototypen. Derzeit sind wir ein kleines Start-Up mit limitierten finanziellen Kapazitäten. Mit eurer Unterstützung werden wir fähig sein die Produktion zu starten und euch fertige Sets nach Hause zu liefern. Zusätzlich werden zukünftige Entwicklungen beschleunigt. Dies verspricht noch mehr Spass für die Zukunft. Du bist es, der uns darin unterstützen kann! Du machst es möglich, dass wir mehr Abenteuer und Bildung bereitstellen können.


Bildung heißt Zukunft! 

Wenn Du unser Projekt unterstützt, investierst Du in die Zukunft von vielen Menschen, nicht nur in unser Projekt! Unser
 Ziel ist es so viele Menschen wie möglich zu erreichen und ihnen die 
Möglichkeit geben, mehr über unsere moderne Welt und der darin 
enthaltenen Technik zu lernen.


Seid einer unser ersten Cagebot Anwender. Unsere herausragenden Perks werden Dich befähigen einer der ersten Benutzer in einer wachsenden Gemeinschaft zu werden!Viele Dinge sind nur für den Moment und werden später weggeworfen. Wir möchten ein System schaffen, welches modular ist und selbst noch nach Jahren benutzt oder erweitert werden kann.

</p><p><b>Short Summary</b></p>
<p>Welcome Supporters!</p>
<p>We are SafeTrek, currently the #1 personal safety mobile app for iOS and Android that is improving the way people request
emergency help! </p><p>Our app is available for download to your phone with either iOS/Android today!! <a href=""https://www.safetrekapp.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.safetrekapp.com/</a></p><p><b><b>We need your support to build our smart watch app! Every app supporter gets our current app for iOS or Android, which will allow you to use our watch app when it is launched or use our mobile app at a great discount!!!</b></b></p><p>SafeTrek is a group of tech geeks that aspired to devise a way to make the world around us a safer place, utilizing smart phones  as our mode of achieving this goal. Our
inspiration was first sparked by the blue-light safety stations we observed in our
respective colleges, their existence led us to wonder: why not build a mobile
app that goes beyond a stationary blue-light safety station? An app that has
the ability to quickly alert police or emergency services to individuals
by pinpointing their location and communicating their personal information.
And- if police or emergency services seem unnecessary by the user- our app simply
gives them peace of mind when in a unsafe or unknown area (Our trade marked “Hold
Until Safe<sup>TM</sup>” feature). Thus, arrived the birth of SafeTrek in 2014!</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1432150747/bzlxzqebbycuofkeokmw.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<p>We are excited tell our supporters that the SafeTrek mobile app has been out on both Android and iOS devices for the last 8 months maintain a rating
of five stars for both platforms! Users are so fond of our safety application due to its convenience,
accessibility, and simple- but effective- design. One can conveniently access
our Hold Until Safe<sup>TM </sup> button at anytime, which allows our users the peace of mind in unfamiliar and unsafe areas. It’s like having 911 emergency services on hold until you're safe. </p>
<p>As a company, we have
witnessed a positive trend over the last year involving smart watch purchases
and wish to keep up with our tech savvy users by constructing a SafeTrek app
for the Apple Watch.To achieve this
goal, we need your support to subsidize the costs of
design, engineering, and testing. It is imperative for us to build the smart
watch application because we believe in our product and know it has the ability
to save lives. We are a small, but passionate, four-person team that works
diligently around the clock to keep our users safe. We have everything laid out
and ready to build, however, we need additional funding to fully design, engineer, and test the smart watch app to our SafeTrek standards. </p><p>In addition to the current SafeTrek app features, our customers will have the ability on the smart watch app to set alerts to “check in” or “snooze,” while they are in an unsafe or unfamiliar area or situation. If they do not “check in” or hit “snooze,” emergency services will be alerted. This is an invaluable tool for an array of reasons: for the person who goes running by themselves, the real estate agent showing a home or apartment, an individual out on a hike, or any other circumstance that one can not have their finger on our  Hold Until Safe feature. This enables individuals to still have emergency services on hold until they are safe.<br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1432149743/auvcb4fbnqduoedexkbg.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>

a safer place. To show our appreciation, the SafeTrek team will also be
providing you with certain perks. We ask that you please check out our reviews
and see what users have to say about us on iOS and Android and help us make this project possible! </p>

<p></p></div>","Short Summary
Welcome Supporters!
We are SafeTrek, currently the #1 personal safety mobile app for iOS and Android that is improving the way people request
emergency help! Our app is available for download to your phone with either iOS/Android today!! https://www.safetrekapp.com/We need your support to build our smart watch app! Every app supporter gets our current app for iOS or Android, which will allow you to use our watch app when it is launched or use our mobile app at a great discount!!!SafeTrek is a group of tech geeks that aspired to devise a way to make the world around us a safer place, utilizing smart phones  as our mode of achieving this goal. Our
inspiration was first sparked by the blue-light safety stations we observed in our
respective colleges, their existence led us to wonder: why not build a mobile
app that goes beyond a stationary blue-light safety station? An app that has
the ability to quickly alert police or emergency services to individuals
by pinpointing their location and communicating their personal information.
And- if police or emergency services seem unnecessary by the user- our app simply
gives them peace of mind when in a unsafe or unknown area (Our trade marked “Hold
Until SafeTM” feature). Thus, arrived the birth of SafeTrek in 2014!
We are excited tell our supporters that the SafeTrek mobile app has been out on both Android and iOS devices for the last 8 months maintain a rating
of five stars for both platforms! Users are so fond of our safety application due to its convenience,
accessibility, and simple- but effective- design. One can conveniently access
our Hold Until SafeTM  button at anytime, which allows our users the peace of mind in unfamiliar and unsafe areas. It’s like having 911 emergency services on hold until you're safe. 
As a company, we have
witnessed a positive trend over the last year involving smart watch purchases
and wish to keep up with our tech savvy users by constructing a SafeTrek app
for the Apple Watch.To achieve this
goal, we need your support to subsidize the costs of
design, engineering, and testing. It is imperative for us to build the smart
watch application because we believe in our product and know it has the ability
to save lives. We are a small, but passionate, four-person team that works
diligently around the clock to keep our users safe. We have everything laid out
and ready to build, however, we need additional funding to fully design, engineer, and test the smart watch app to our SafeTrek standards. In addition to the current SafeTrek app features, our customers will have the ability on the smart watch app to set alerts to “check in” or “snooze,” while they are in an unsafe or unfamiliar area or situation. If they do not “check in” or hit “snooze,” emergency services will be alerted. This is an invaluable tool for an array of reasons: for the person who goes running by themselves, the real estate agent showing a home or apartment, an individual out on a hike, or any other circumstance that one can not have their finger on our  Hold Until Safe feature. This enables individuals to still have emergency services on hold until they are safe.
With that request in
mind, the way we like to think about our Indiegogo campaign is that in
being a supporter and funding this project, you are also helping make the world
a safer place. To show our appreciation, the SafeTrek team will also be
providing you with certain perks. We ask that you please check out our reviews
and see what users have to say about us on iOS and Android and help us make this project possible!

<p>The <strong>AIDS Memorial Quilt</strong> will be on display in Washington DC in June - July 2012.</p>
<p>The <strong>AIDS Memorial Quilt</strong> is an unique work of international ARTS ACTIVISM that reflects the worldwide scope and personal impact of the AIDS pandemic. </p>
<ul>
<li>The textile <strong>Quilt </strong>is composed of<strong> 48,000 individual PANELS</strong> that commemorate more than <strong>91,000 names.</strong>
</li>
<li>The size of the physical <strong>Quilt</strong> measures more than <strong>1.3 million square feet. If laid out in its entirety,</strong><strong> it would cover more than 29 acres of land.</strong>
</li>
<li><strong>It would take a visitor more than 33 days to view every panel—spending only 1 minute at each panel.  </strong></li>
<li>It is the largest LIVING MEMORIAL of its kind in the world. </li>
</ul><p>The year 2012 marks the 25th anniversary of the creation of the Quilt. In June 2012, the Quilt will be featured at the <a href=""http://www.festival.si.edu/2012/creativity_and_crisis/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Smithsonian Folklife Festival</a> in Washington DC.  In July 2012, te Quilt will be laid out—in its entirety—on the Mall of Washington for the<strong> first time since 1996</strong>. </p>
<p>It will take <strong>four days</strong> (July 21-25) to display all 48,000 panels.  These events are part of the <a href=""http://quilt2012.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Quilt 2012</a> program sponsored by the <strong>NAMES Project Foundation</strong>—the non-profit organization that maintains and displays the Quilt.</p>
<p>We know that not everyone who has an interest in the AIDS Memorial QUILT can make the trip to Washington, DC this summer.  Moreover, the entire QUILT has grown so large that all the panels cannot be viewed in one session.</p>
<p><em>We have designed a mobile web app called <strong>AIDS QUILT TOUCH</strong> that enables people to <strong>SEARCH</strong> for a specific NAME on a panel and to <strong>CONTRIBUTE</strong> comments to a Digital Guest Book. For visitors in Washington DC this summer, this application will ALSO enable them to <strong>LOCATE</strong> the display of a specific panel when it is laid out on the National Mall.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>OUR FUNDRAISING GOALS:</em></strong></p>
<p>We seek support through this fundraising campaign to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Complete</strong> the mobile web app -- this involves several groups of people working in small teams in different locations throughout the US;
<ul>
<li>$5k for web programmers</li>
<li>$5k for database re-configuration</li>
<li>$7.5k for image clean-up and recropping</li>
<li>$2.5k for site design </li>
<li>$5k for rewards, reward mailings, and printed materials</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Develop, print and disseminate</strong> user instructions for the several thousand visitors who are expected to view the Quilt this summer;</li>
<li>
<strong>Attract a group of supporters</strong> who will get early access to the first release of the mobile web app, and have the first opportunities to submit comments to the Digital Guest Book.</li>
<li>
<strong>Support a day-long set of panels</strong> discussing the <em>Historical Lessons of the AIDS Pandemic</em>, the <em>Cultural Significance of the AIDS Memorial Quilt</em>, and the plans for the creation of a <em>Digital Archive of the Quilt</em> and other materials.</li>
</ul><div><em><strong>THE IMPACT OF THIS PROJECT</strong></em></div>
<p>We consider the development of the <strong>AIDS QUILT TOUCH</strong> mobile web app an appropriate use of digital technologies in the service of cultural good.  The aim is NOT to replace or interfere with the experience of viewing the textile Quilt, but to augment that experience and to extend the opportunity to view the Quilt to people all over the world through on-line access. </p>
<p>After the <strong>Quilt 2012</strong> events, the <strong>AIDS QUILT TOUCH</strong><strong> </strong>mobile web app will continue to serve as a portal that enables people to browse the entire collection of Quilt panels, to read the many stories of the Quilt, to trace the travels of any single panel, and to participate in crowdsourcing information about individual panels.</p>
<p><em><strong>WHO IS PARTICIPATING IN THIS DEVELOPMENT PROJECT</strong></em></p>
<p>Anne Balsamo and the <a href=""http://www.designingculture.net/blog/?page_id=960"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Public Interactives Research Team</a> at the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism at the University of Southern California (USC) are collaborating with the NAMES Project Foundation in Atlanta, GA to create several interactive digital experiences designed to augment the viewing of the physical Quilt during the summer Quilt 2012 events.  We have begun development of the web-based application in collaboration with the <a href=""http://dsph.uiowa.edu/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Digital Studio for the Public Humanities at the University of Iowa</a>, under the direction of artist Jon Winet.  </p>
<p>Here are some of the WIREFRAMES for key pages of the <strong>AIDS QUILT TOUCH</strong> mobile web app.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p></div>","Quilt 2012:  The Digital Experiences
The AIDS Memorial Quilt will be on display in Washington DC in June - July 2012.
The AIDS Memorial Quilt is an unique work of international ARTS ACTIVISM that reflects the worldwide scope and personal impact of the AIDS pandemic. 

The textile Quilt is composed of 48,000 individual PANELS that commemorate more than 91,000 names.

The size of the physical Quilt measures more than 1.3 million square feet. If laid out in its entirety, it would cover more than 29 acres of land.

It would take a visitor more than 33 days to view every panel—spending only 1 minute at each panel.  
It is the largest LIVING MEMORIAL of its kind in the world. 
The year 2012 marks the 25th anniversary of the creation of the Quilt. In June 2012, the Quilt will be featured at the Smithsonian Folklife Festival in Washington DC.  In July 2012, te Quilt will be laid out—in its entirety—on the Mall of Washington for the first time since 1996. 
It will take four days (July 21-25) to display all 48,000 panels.  These events are part of the Quilt 2012 program sponsored by the NAMES Project Foundation—the non-profit organization that maintains and displays the Quilt.
We know that not everyone who has an interest in the AIDS Memorial QUILT can make the trip to Washington, DC this summer.  Moreover, the entire QUILT has grown so large that all the panels cannot be viewed in one session.
We have designed a mobile web app called AIDS QUILT TOUCH that enables people to SEARCH for a specific NAME on a panel and to CONTRIBUTE comments to a Digital Guest Book. For visitors in Washington DC this summer, this application will ALSO enable them to LOCATE the display of a specific panel when it is laid out on the National Mall.
OUR FUNDRAISING GOALS:
We seek support through this fundraising campaign to:


Complete the mobile web app -- this involves several groups of people working in small teams in different locations throughout the US;

$5k for web programmers
$5k for database re-configuration
$7.5k for image clean-up and recropping
$2.5k for site design 
$5k for rewards, reward mailings, and printed materials



Develop, print and disseminate user instructions for the several thousand visitors who are expected to view the Quilt this summer;

Attract a group of supporters who will get early access to the first release of the mobile web app, and have the first opportunities to submit comments to the Digital Guest Book.

Support a day-long set of panels discussing the Historical Lessons of the AIDS Pandemic, the Cultural Significance of the AIDS Memorial Quilt, and the plans for the creation of a Digital Archive of the Quilt and other materials.
THE IMPACT OF THIS PROJECT
We consider the development of the AIDS QUILT TOUCH mobile web app an appropriate use of digital technologies in the service of cultural good.  The aim is NOT to replace or interfere with the experience of viewing the textile Quilt, but to augment that experience and to extend the opportunity to view the Quilt to people all over the world through on-line access. 
After the Quilt 2012 events, the AIDS QUILT TOUCH mobile web app will continue to serve as a portal that enables people to browse the entire collection of Quilt panels, to read the many stories of the Quilt, to trace the travels of any single panel, and to participate in crowdsourcing information about individual panels.
WHO IS PARTICIPATING IN THIS DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Anne Balsamo and the Public Interactives Research Team at the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism at the University of Southern California (USC) are collaborating with the NAMES Project Foundation in Atlanta, GA to create several interactive digital experiences designed to augment the viewing of the physical Quilt during the summer Quilt 2012 events.  We have begun development of the web-based application in collaboration with the Digital Studio for the Public Humanities at the University of Iowa, under the direction of artist Jon Winet.  
Here are some of the WIREFRAMES for key pages of the AIDS QUILT TOUCH mobile web app.

Last year we received a small grant from the National Endowment of the Humanities to build a table-top browser that allows viewers to search through the massive database of Quilt images.  This interactive experience will ALSO be on display during the Quilt in the Capital events, but the size of the table limits the number of viewers who can use the browser at any given time.  

We want to make the Quilt images and information available to a greater number of people, so we are now building the AIDS QUILT TOUCH mobile web app.  
REWARDS for our BACKERS
We have a LIMITED time to create the digital application.
The public LAUNCH date for the first version of the AIDS Quilt Touch is June 27, 2012, in time for the opening of the Smithsonian Folklife Festival.  That version will launch with the NAME Search function.
If we reach our funding goal by July 8, 2012, we will proceed to finish and launch two additional functions for the AIDS Quilt Touch mobile web app:  the Digital Guest Book and the Panel Location Map.
We will make the mobile web app available early to all our financial backers, so that they can get the first experience browsing the extensive collection of digital images and information about Quilt panels and add the first entries to the Digital Guest Book.  During the Quilt 2012 events and afterwards, the mobile web app will be freely available for all users.
We appreciate all levels of support.  And we have a number of ""thank you"" gifts for our backers.  For supporters who have the means to contribute larger amounts, we offer rooms at a boutique hotel in Washington DC during the QUILT on the MALL events from July 20-25, 2012
If you have ever wanted to browse the AIDS Memorial Quilt, contribute a story about its meaning and significance, or support the work to make the Quilt stories available to a wider audience, this is your chance. 
Even if you cannot donate to this campaign, you can still contribute to the effort by spreading the word to your friends.  
Once the mobile web app is launched, please download it from www.aidsquilttouch.org.  Engaging with the Quilt panels and taking time to remember the activist efforts that are part of the history of AIDS in the US, helps raise awareness about the current status of HIV and AIDS not only in the US, but throughout the world.

<p>When the FuelBox idea
was first developing, we knew we had a great idea. But many people told us we
couldn’t make it happen. They said we were too young and too green to create a
new innovative and successful mobile charging solution in a market filled with
large companies. But we didn’t believe them and our first product –<i>The Ultimate Charging Solution</i>– has now launched!</p>
<p>It all started one day
as we searched for our roommate’s lost phone charger – again.. We realized
there’s got to be a better solution. We looked around at what was available on
the market and it was clear: nothing was good enough. </p><p>
</p><p>We quickly became passionate
about creating a BETTER universal solution – with everything you need in one
place. The ONLY charger you will ever need, at home and on-the-go. Less stuff,
less waste, no more cords to lose. More life-friendly. A better way to stay
connected. And more fuel to power our busy lives.</p>
<p>But we didn’t want to
just create a new product. We want to lead a revolution that will change the

</p>
<p>We are making an awesome-looking and simple-to-use wishlist service that works on the web and in mobile -
without ads, spam or selling user information to others. Unlike virtually any other social
service. WishSimply will be the best tool for co-ordinating
gifts/wishes. 
</p>
<p></p>
<h3>My Story<br/>
</h3>Have you or your kids ever received gifts that were unwanted,
duplicated or just inappropriate? Or wrong size? Or have you had problems
inventing gifts for somebody else?
<p>
</p>
<p>Wouldn't it be nice to be
able to tell others easily what you would like to get and also find out
what others would like to get?
</p>
<p>I would certainly like that.</p>
<p> Ever since I got married almost 15 years ago and made a wishlist for wedding gifts, I've been trying to find a good wishlist service. I've used several, but all of them have had big issues. Most of them are limited to the offering of one shop. Others have a user interface that is so bloated and messy I had a hard time figuring it out myself. There's no way I can share a list like that with anybody. The point of the wishlist is to save time, not to turn me into a help desk person. Also, many services have ads that may even make it hard to distinguish between what's actually being wished and what's just an ad. A media-savvy person will manage, but what about kids or senior citizens?</p>
<p>Later, it's also become a matter of protecting my personal data. A wishlist service would get data on what I like and wish and the people I know, including their email addresses. Do I want to give those data to a company that reserves the right to do what it pleases with them? Or to a company with shady affiliate agreements that are only mentioned in the small print? A company that places various cookies and beacons to my computer to make tracking me efficient? Most of all, do I want to ask others to use a service like that? Nope. I can make my own decisions, but I don't want to endorse a service that's not going to keep its hands off from  my friends' and family's data.</p>
<p>
</p>

I worked for an online stock brokerage company/exchange traded bank for almost 15 years. I led the software development department that made almost all the core services, from client applications and web pages to automated order management systems. After the bank was acquired, I got the opportunity to work on this project 
that I had long had in my mind, and I knew I could do well.<br/><p></p>
<h3>Solution - What does WishSimply offer?<br/>
</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>WishSimply does all you need it to do. It has a clean and nice GUI without ads. It's optimized for
simplicity. This is derived from stock trading applications, where time
 is
money and unclarity will make huge costs. <br/></p>
<p>It has very simple
processes, but still everything that is needed. Everything you need is in the
same view. This is possible, because the service doesn't have ads that take up space
from the screen. It also has
two layouts, one optimized for a big screen and the other optimized for
small mobile devices. We haven't made a compromise layout that
would serve neither screen size well.</p>

<h3>Beautiful and Simple GUI<br/>
</h3>
<p>
WishSimply service has a beautiful, clean and simple GUI. We've put everything you need in one screen, and in normal use you don't need to
change page. This might sound surprising at first, but the
GUI is very spacious and makes clever use of in-line pop-ups that keep the
context clear all the time. The controls are clear and big. The service
is used from a web browser, but it feels more like an application than a web page. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The first time you use the service, there is a wizard on top of the GUI that shows you hands-on how to use the service in 2 or 3 steps, depending on whether you are creating your own list or using somebody
else's list.
</p>
<h1></h1>
<h3>Not limited to any one shop<br/>
</h3>
<p>
WishSimply is not bound or
limited to any particular shop. This means that you can add to this service any
wishes you want. You can add items from any shop you like or you
can add wishes that are not available in any shop. You can use this
service for sharing the wishes of anyone, from your toddler to your grandmother. You can use it for name giving,
birthday, graduation, Christmas, wedding or any other event.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h1></h1>
<h3>No Ads<br/>
</h3>
<p>WishSimply doesn't serve
ads, send spam or have any affiliate agreements now or later. We consider this a very important aspect of the service we want to
provide and we are committed to not changing this part of the service in the
future.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Not showing
ads in the service enables us to provide you a better service by making the GUI clean
and pleasant instead of distracting. We can maximize the
page area and show you more of the stuff that really matters than other services. 
</p>
<h1></h1>
<h3>Protecting your and your friends' privacy</h3>
<p>
As WishSimply doesn't serve
ads, send spam or have affiliate agreements, it doesn't need
your information. WishSimply doesn't give or sell your information
further. WishSimply also excludes the option to change that part of the
service later on, so you will know that it won't change in the future
either. Quite an exceptional and refreshing approach compared other
social services, isn't it?</p>
<p>
All personal information
that is filled to the service is used for providing the service for
you and your friends that you have invited to the service. Connection
to the service is protected with the same SSL technology that banks
use, making it virtually impossible for outsiders to get your data.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h1>
</h1>
<h3>How does it work? <br/>
</h3>
<p>
Login to the service and
follow a wizard that shows you how to use the service in three
simple steps: 1) add wishes to your list, 2) fill in event
and list details, and 3) share your list with your friends.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The view your friends have to your
list is almost exactly like your own. The only difference is that
the only thing they can do is mark wishes fulfilled, and if you have many lists, they only
see the list that is shared with them.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The people you invite to
the service will receive your personal message (if you have typed
one) and a unique link to the service. By clicking the link they
are directed directly to your list and presented with a brief
introduction to the service. Then they are guided to use the service
with two simple steps involving two clicks. One on an image and one
on a button. And that's all! You can't make it simpler. The service
is easy to use for all, from children to seniors.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h1></h1>
<h3>End result</h3>
<p>No more duplicates and
gift replacements. No more gifts that end up hidden in the storage 
room
or garage.  
Less headache for inventing gifts. Event and gift
conversations are neatly in one place. 
</p>

<h3>Why IndieGoGo?</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>What I really want is to connect with people who value this project and its principles. And
putting your money where your mouth is is an easy way to prove it. I have set the pledges very low so that showing support won't be an issue for anyone. <br/></p>
<p>I am not so much collecting money with this project, although everything is very welcome and I hope that the funding goal will go over many times. So far, I've been putting money to this project from my own pocket, and
anything that this IndieGoGo campaign will manage to
collect
will be used to further develop this service for you and everybody
else.<br/></p>
<p>Later on, this service will be collecting the money needed for its upkeep from web shops that interact with it by using a 'Wish' button (similar to the Facebook 'Like' button or Pinterest 'PinIT' button). Shops will also love this service, but that is another story. If you want to find out more, you can find more information about that in the WishSimply.com About Us section.<br/></p>In this IndieGoGo project, I'm offering a limited-time opportunity for a very limited number of participants to be among the first to join
this service. To take part in making a great
service. Something that you can proudly recommend to your friends.
Something that looks great, works smoothly, is safe to use and won't
mess with your or their user data.
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>We've just seen how
another privacy-honoring project (ello) got over 5 million in funding, and
has 3 million users waiting invitation to the service. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Jump in now before the seats are
gone and help create a better world where companies will respect their
users.</p>
<p>(I have no doubt that this project would
get the money should I seek it, but with your small donations we can stay independent together.) <br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>A great feeling that you have participated in creating this unique, great and useful social web service that will help you, your family and your friends now and in the many coming highlight moments in their life.<br/>
</li>
<li>You take your privacy back by showing that there is a need for privacy-respecting services like this. You are not a product!<br/>
</li>
<li>An account in this service among the first users and updates in the future.</li>
<li>The privilege to participate in deciding how the service is developed in the future</li>
<li>A letter from the original Finnish Santa Claus (operated since 1950) with a personal message (written by me), where Santa Claus will thank you (by mentioning your name) for supporting this project and making his work easier. The letter will be franked with the Arctic Circle's special postmark that you can't get from anywhere else. It's so cool! You can hang that letter on your wall, and show it proudly to your whole family!  <br/>

We are making an awesome-looking and simple-to-use wishlist service that works on the web and in mobile -
without ads, spam or selling user information to others. Unlike virtually any other social
service. WishSimply will be the best tool for co-ordinating
gifts/wishes. 


My Story
Have you or your kids ever received gifts that were unwanted,
duplicated or just inappropriate? Or wrong size? Or have you had problems
inventing gifts for somebody else?


Wouldn't it be nice to be
able to tell others easily what you would like to get and also find out
what others would like to get?

I would certainly like that.
 Ever since I got married almost 15 years ago and made a wishlist for wedding gifts, I've been trying to find a good wishlist service. I've used several, but all of them have had big issues. Most of them are limited to the offering of one shop. Others have a user interface that is so bloated and messy I had a hard time figuring it out myself. There's no way I can share a list like that with anybody. The point of the wishlist is to save time, not to turn me into a help desk person. Also, many services have ads that may even make it hard to distinguish between what's actually being wished and what's just an ad. A media-savvy person will manage, but what about kids or senior citizens?
Later, it's also become a matter of protecting my personal data. A wishlist service would get data on what I like and wish and the people I know, including their email addresses. Do I want to give those data to a company that reserves the right to do what it pleases with them? Or to a company with shady affiliate agreements that are only mentioned in the small print? A company that places various cookies and beacons to my computer to make tracking me efficient? Most of all, do I want to ask others to use a service like that? Nope. I can make my own decisions, but I don't want to endorse a service that's not going to keep its hands off from  my friends' and family's data.



I worked for an online stock brokerage company/exchange traded bank for almost 15 years. I led the software development department that made almost all the core services, from client applications and web pages to automated order management systems. After the bank was acquired, I got the opportunity to work on this project 
that I had long had in my mind, and I knew I could do well.
Solution - What does WishSimply offer?



WishSimply does all you need it to do. It has a clean and nice GUI without ads. It's optimized for
simplicity. This is derived from stock trading applications, where time
 is
money and unclarity will make huge costs. 
It has very simple
processes, but still everything that is needed. Everything you need is in the
same view. This is possible, because the service doesn't have ads that take up space
from the screen. It also has
two layouts, one optimized for a big screen and the other optimized for
small mobile devices. We haven't made a compromise layout that
would serve neither screen size well.









Beautiful and Simple GUI


WishSimply service has a beautiful, clean and simple GUI. We've put everything you need in one screen, and in normal use you don't need to
change page. This might sound surprising at first, but the
GUI is very spacious and makes clever use of in-line pop-ups that keep the
context clear all the time. The controls are clear and big. The service
is used from a web browser, but it feels more like an application than a web page. 



The first time you use the service, there is a wizard on top of the GUI that shows you hands-on how to use the service in 2 or 3 steps, depending on whether you are creating your own list or using somebody
else's list.


Not limited to any one shop


WishSimply is not bound or
limited to any particular shop. This means that you can add to this service any
wishes you want. You can add items from any shop you like or you
can add wishes that are not available in any shop. You can use this
service for sharing the wishes of anyone, from your toddler to your grandmother. You can use it for name giving,
birthday, graduation, Christmas, wedding or any other event.



No Ads

WishSimply doesn't serve
ads, send spam or have any affiliate agreements now or later. We consider this a very important aspect of the service we want to
provide and we are committed to not changing this part of the service in the
future.


Not showing
ads in the service enables us to provide you a better service by making the GUI clean
and pleasant instead of distracting. We can maximize the
page area and show you more of the stuff that really matters than other services. 


Protecting your and your friends' privacy

As WishSimply doesn't serve
ads, send spam or have affiliate agreements, it doesn't need
your information. WishSimply doesn't give or sell your information
further. WishSimply also excludes the option to change that part of the
service later on, so you will know that it won't change in the future
either. Quite an exceptional and refreshing approach compared other
social services, isn't it?

All personal information
that is filled to the service is used for providing the service for
you and your friends that you have invited to the service. Connection
to the service is protected with the same SSL technology that banks
use, making it virtually impossible for outsiders to get your data.




How does it work? 


Login to the service and
follow a wizard that shows you how to use the service in three
simple steps: 1) add wishes to your list, 2) fill in event
and list details, and 3) share your list with your friends.


The view your friends have to your
list is almost exactly like your own. The only difference is that
the only thing they can do is mark wishes fulfilled, and if you have many lists, they only
see the list that is shared with them.


The people you invite to
the service will receive your personal message (if you have typed
one) and a unique link to the service. By clicking the link they
are directed directly to your list and presented with a brief
introduction to the service. Then they are guided to use the service
with two simple steps involving two clicks. One on an image and one
on a button. And that's all! You can't make it simpler. The service
is easy to use for all, from children to seniors.



End result
No more duplicates and
gift replacements. No more gifts that end up hidden in the storage 
room
or garage.  
Less headache for inventing gifts. Event and gift
conversations are neatly in one place. 



Why IndieGoGo?


What I really want is to connect with people who value this project and its principles. And
putting your money where your mouth is is an easy way to prove it. I have set the pledges very low so that showing support won't be an issue for anyone. 
I am not so much collecting money with this project, although everything is very welcome and I hope that the funding goal will go over many times. So far, I've been putting money to this project from my own pocket, and
anything that this IndieGoGo campaign will manage to
collect
will be used to further develop this service for you and everybody
else.
Later on, this service will be collecting the money needed for its upkeep from web shops that interact with it by using a 'Wish' button (similar to the Facebook 'Like' button or Pinterest 'PinIT' button). Shops will also love this service, but that is another story. If you want to find out more, you can find more information about that in the WishSimply.com About Us section.In this IndieGoGo project, I'm offering a limited-time opportunity for a very limited number of participants to be among the first to join
this service. To take part in making a great
service. Something that you can proudly recommend to your friends.
Something that looks great, works smoothly, is safe to use and won't
mess with your or their user data.




We've just seen how
another privacy-honoring project (ello) got over 5 million in funding, and
has 3 million users waiting invitation to the service. 



Jump in now before the seats are
gone and help create a better world where companies will respect their
users.
(I have no doubt that this project would
get the money should I seek it, but with your small donations we can stay independent together.) 
  What You Get

A great feeling that you have participated in creating this unique, great and useful social web service that will help you, your family and your friends now and in the many coming highlight moments in their life.

You take your privacy back by showing that there is a need for privacy-respecting services like this. You are not a product!

An account in this service among the first users and updates in the future.
The privilege to participate in deciding how the service is developed in the future
A letter from the original Finnish Santa Claus (operated since 1950) with a personal message (written by me), where Santa Claus will thank you (by mentioning your name) for supporting this project and making his work easier. The letter will be franked with the Arctic Circle's special postmark that you can't get from anywhere else. It's so cool! You can hang that letter on your wall, and show it proudly to your whole family!  

   


The Impact
In addition for being the best wishlist service, we will protect your personal data and respect your privacy. According the latest Peer Research survey, 90% of people believe that they have lost control over their privacy. If this project is a success, chances are that other services will follow suite, and users will start getting their privacy back piece by piece. I would like to see that and help make it happen.    Risks & ChallengesThe service is ready to use, and we
have been using it already for more than a year while developing it further. The mobile apps are also working already,
and are being fine tuned at the moment. They will be submitted in
app stores asap. There is a risk that Appstore won't accept our app in time, but we have done and submitted two other apps in appstore before, so we have quite a good understanding of the process, and we are confident that it will be there by the time this campaign is over. In case of any delays, I will be transparent about them and will update you.    

Our service has been load
tested, but real usage is always different from test data. Participation in this
project is limited, so we believe that the service can easily handle that. Should this
not be the case, we are determined to delay any further features and
put all focus on fixing possible churns and improving the service
for existing users. (We are using this service
ourselves, too, so we're in the same boat with everyone else.)  

  Other Ways You Can Help If you like this project please spread the word. Post it on Facebook, Twitter, or any social media that you use. All that is very valuable, and to encourage you to do it even more, we have also created for you a great financial incentive.
Possible financial gain 

We're offering a 50% commission on every pledge you bring in up to 100$. After that the commission is 30%.
 The baseline for this program starts at $30. Once you've referred $30

<h3><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">What's This Fund?</span></h3>
<p>This is a complicated case, and a situation that many of us car enthusiasts deal with every day on the track or the road. At the end of the day, a historically important car has been badly damaged and a well-known journalist has had a very bad start to the year. I'd like to raise as much as we can towards Mark's bill so that we car nuts can continue to see these great vehicles on the track as they were meant to be driven, and continue to read the writings of those given the opportunity to drive them for us. Let's put this particular event behind us and allow racing journalism to continue in future in the fashion it has for a hundred years.</p>
<h3>Where Will the Money Go?</h3>
<p>The money will be transferred into UK pounds and given as a cheque to Mark Hales. There are other moves afoot to raise money for the same purpose - if we all end up in the delightful position of having too much money, Mr Hales will be asked to nominate a motoring charity of his choice to which the remainder of the money will be donated.</p>
<h3>Who Set This Up?</h3>
<p>My name is Chris, and I'm just a car guy like you. I have a race car that I let other people drive (not a Porsche 917, sadly) and I'm passionate that this event shouldn't scare journalists or racers out of some great stories.</p>
<h3>How Else Can I Contribute?</h3>
<p>Mark is in touch with the UK magazine, Track and Driver, who have set up a fund <a href=""http://www.trackdriver.com/mark_hales_appeal.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>. If you know of other campaigns, let me know and I'll list them too.</p>

In 2009, Mark Hales, a respected journalist, was invited to drive a Porsche 917 belonging to David Piper, a former Formula 1 champion. He drove the car at the superb Cadwell Park circuit in Linconshire, UK.
The car blew up.
Mr Piper was not pleased, and a legal battle ensued. The car was repaired and sold, but the legal battle has only just ended.
After a long, drawn-out case, Mr Hales was ordered on January 22nd by a UK court to pay $174,000 in damages a mixture of legal fees and the cost of repairing the car.

on campus and in the city. Late in the evening, when streets are dark, our
safety concerns rise significantly. But one can’t call police just because he
is feeling unsafe. </span><br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Our application <i>Friendly
Help</i> provides secure and private way to be safe on the streets. When
feeling unsafe, user selects one of the modes of tracking, either friend option
or campus police (at participating colleges). Then selected friends get a
real-time track of the user with associated status. In case of police tracking
option, campus police receives anonymous tracking information and status. If
something happens on the way, user can send instant alarm, with his location
pinpointed on the map. The application also allows to send location to selected
friends and chat with individual users or friends circles.</p>
<p>The key features of our application include:</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary The idea came to life based on our experiences
on campus and in the city. Late in the evening, when streets are dark, our
safety concerns rise significantly. But one can’t call police just because he
is feeling unsafe. 


Our application Friendly
Help provides secure and private way to be safe on the streets. When
feeling unsafe, user selects one of the modes of tracking, either friend option
or campus police (at participating colleges). Then selected friends get a
real-time track of the user with associated status. In case of police tracking
option, campus police receives anonymous tracking information and status. If
something happens on the way, user can send instant alarm, with his location
pinpointed on the map. The application also allows to send location to selected
friends and chat with individual users or friends circles.
The key features of our application include:



Adult style safety application

Real-time tracking with an alert button: activated and controlled by user. No information is shared with user's friends until user decides to do so.
Location sharing with friends
Chat room

   What We Need & What You Get 

Right now we are testing application. To finish
application we need money to pay for communication services, beta-testing,
developing application for other platforms and web-interface. 
Our perks include beta-testing, contributor certificate, being featured as a contributor and a t-shirt. 
If we do not reach our entire goal (which hopefully would not happen) the funds raised will go to paying the most urgent expenses: communication services and beta-testing. Developing applications for other platforms is one of the most costly parts of our project.
   The Impact 

Our application will help to make the
world safer. It would contribute to lowering number of crimes on campus and
help freshman and their parents adapt to the changed situation.


Risks & Challenges 

We are determined to finish our
project and bring the product to life. However, no business project can omit analyzing and admitting existing risks and challenges. At the moment there are three types of
risks:


Technical risks:  Application has a complicated
implementation and is dependent on Apple, Microsoft and text-message operators
for successful functioning. Despite a high reliability of the operators listed,
there is always a chance one of them would malfunction.


Financial risks:  There is a risk that project will not
get enough funding to finance the starting costs of the application. (You can help us with this one!)


Conceptual
risks: This
can not be considered a universal safety system. If smartphone battery dies,
the application would not work. Smartphone with access to the Internet is
required for successful application functioning.

<h3>What is Park On The Fly?</h3>
<p><strong>Created by concerned UF students</strong>, Park on the Fly is a massively scalable parking management system designed to make buying, selling, and finding parking simple.  The system allows consumers to purchase parking before leaving home, removing the hassle of searching for an open lot.  Our clients are property owners looking to monetize unused or not fully utilized parking or land near high traffic areas.  Our clients are also individuals that want to sell their home parking spaces for special events and day to day parking.  We are currently active at 13 locations, even 1 parking garage, and are working hard to add locations daily, even in new cities!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>How Does It Work?</h3>
<p>Simply go to our website and tell us where you're going and when you're going there.  We'll show you the lots we manage and let you buy your spot hours, days, or even weeks in advance.  The day of your reservation just drive to the lot and park.  No printouts necessary!  We're also currently developing our mobile app which will allow you to find and buy parking in under 30 seconds.  We expect to release the app within the next two months. </p>

<h3>The Goal</h3>
<p>We intend to build a cluster of Raspberry Pi devices, initially configured as a build farm and tasked with compiling all the source code of Ubuntu Saucy (current stable 13.10), Precise (Current LTS 12.04) and Trusty (Next release, 14.04). The objective is to produce a bootable SD card image and host binary repositories for all packages that will build.</p>
<h3>The History</h3>
<p>Back when the Raspberry Pi was in development it was shown running Ubuntu 9.04, Jaunty Jackalope. This was the last Ubuntu release that supported the ARMv6 instruction set, from that point on Ubuntu was optimised for newer ARM chips and would not run on the Broadcom chip that the Pi used. I am the point of contact of the Ubuntu UK Local Community team and I was dead excited about this little computer with it's exposed PCB and low price point. I asked some of the Ubuntu ARM folk if they could support it going forward, but that wasn't going to be possible, they didn't have the resources to build for two ARM platforms and the bottom line was that the Pi probably wasn't going to provide a good user experience for the increasingly heavy Ubuntu user interface. This was sad, but it was the situation. I was a bit concerned that the Raspberry Pi foundation was proceeding on the basis that Jaunty was available - it was already old, going out of support and was a dead end, there were going to be no future updates for it. I was concerned that the UK Local community was going to be landed with a lot of new users who were having a poor user experience and there would be nothing we could do about it. Reluctantly I approached the Raspberry Pi foundation (I met the lovely Liz and Eben at an event in Oxford) and shared my concerns with them, and suggested Debian was the way forward, so the Pi would have a system based on a platform Ubuntu users would be familiar with, that would get updates.</p>
<p>So this was sad, I wasn't happy about it, the foundation wasn't happy about it, many users were not happy about it, but it was much better to have a new Debian with updates and prospects than an old dead end Ubuntu release.</p>
<p>Moving on to the present, the Raspberry Pi is a huge success, Rasbian is a great operating platform for it, the LXDE desktop is fine, the Wayland demo was brilliant and loads of cool projects are happening based on the Pi. We still want Ubuntu on it though. We are using it in embedded projects, it is also turning up in things like the OpenERP Point of Sale kit, situations where it doesn't need a responsive user interface (or a user interface at all). It would be great to know that all the libraries we are using on it are the same versions we are using on other computers that are running Ubuntu. It might be nice to see what the Ubuntu Unity desktop looks like on the Pi, especially Unity 8 running in Mir, but that explicitly isn't a goal. This project aims to build everything that will build from source without too much hassle. If that gets us a desktop then great, if it gets us a command line with python, that is great too.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We want to build a compile farm, based on the Raspberry Pi platform.<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> </span></p>
<p>We will construct a rack (wood, home made, probably based on something from IKEA) that contains 32 PI build machines and one or two controlling nodes with lots of disk space. The controller will run wanna-build and will host the source repository and built binaries. The build machines will all grab packages from the wanna-build queue, set up a build environment and build them.</p>
<p>Each node needs a Pi (£25), a 32GB SD card (£20), Power supply (£6), Networking (£8), power cabling and shelving (£11) so about £70 per node. 32 nodes sounds like a nice number, which is £2240, the controller nodes and assorted other costs and contingency bring us up to the £2500 target.</p>
<p>Should we raise more than the £2500 we are asking for then we will probably add more nodes to the cluster and spend more time fixing stuff that doesn't build from source. Should funds allow, we might get a second set of SD cards, so we can quickly re-task the cluster from one configuration to another.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>What will we call it?</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Probably not Ubuntu, because it isn't an official build of Ubuntu - and will probably have things that fail to build from source. We will need a name, maybe we will choose one, maybe someone will buy the naming rights perk!</p>

<h3>Who are we?</h3>
<div>Just a bunch of folk, this project is not associated with either Canonical or the Raspberry Pi foundation, it is more of a grassroots community effort, some of us as individuals are involved in the Ubuntu project. Libertus Solutions is a consultancy company that provides support and advice for Free and Open Source software to businesses, occasionally using the Raspberry Pi platform as part of a solution. This is a bit of a side project, but we will put it through the company accounts so we pay all the right taxes and are all official and above board. We welcome additional help from anyone with an interest in the cluster.</div></span></span></span></span></div>","The Goal
We intend to build a cluster of Raspberry Pi devices, initially configured as a build farm and tasked with compiling all the source code of Ubuntu Saucy (current stable 13.10), Precise (Current LTS 12.04) and Trusty (Next release, 14.04). The objective is to produce a bootable SD card image and host binary repositories for all packages that will build.
The History
Back when the Raspberry Pi was in development it was shown running Ubuntu 9.04, Jaunty Jackalope. This was the last Ubuntu release that supported the ARMv6 instruction set, from that point on Ubuntu was optimised for newer ARM chips and would not run on the Broadcom chip that the Pi used. I am the point of contact of the Ubuntu UK Local Community team and I was dead excited about this little computer with it's exposed PCB and low price point. I asked some of the Ubuntu ARM folk if they could support it going forward, but that wasn't going to be possible, they didn't have the resources to build for two ARM platforms and the bottom line was that the Pi probably wasn't going to provide a good user experience for the increasingly heavy Ubuntu user interface. This was sad, but it was the situation. I was a bit concerned that the Raspberry Pi foundation was proceeding on the basis that Jaunty was available - it was already old, going out of support and was a dead end, there were going to be no future updates for it. I was concerned that the UK Local community was going to be landed with a lot of new users who were having a poor user experience and there would be nothing we could do about it. Reluctantly I approached the Raspberry Pi foundation (I met the lovely Liz and Eben at an event in Oxford) and shared my concerns with them, and suggested Debian was the way forward, so the Pi would have a system based on a platform Ubuntu users would be familiar with, that would get updates.
So this was sad, I wasn't happy about it, the foundation wasn't happy about it, many users were not happy about it, but it was much better to have a new Debian with updates and prospects than an old dead end Ubuntu release.
Moving on to the present, the Raspberry Pi is a huge success, Rasbian is a great operating platform for it, the LXDE desktop is fine, the Wayland demo was brilliant and loads of cool projects are happening based on the Pi. We still want Ubuntu on it though. We are using it in embedded projects, it is also turning up in things like the OpenERP Point of Sale kit, situations where it doesn't need a responsive user interface (or a user interface at all). It would be great to know that all the libraries we are using on it are the same versions we are using on other computers that are running Ubuntu. It might be nice to see what the Ubuntu Unity desktop looks like on the Pi, especially Unity 8 running in Mir, but that explicitly isn't a goal. This project aims to build everything that will build from source without too much hassle. If that gets us a desktop then great, if it gets us a command line with python, that is great too.


What We Need & What You Get
We want to build a compile farm, based on the Raspberry Pi platform. 
We will construct a rack (wood, home made, probably based on something from IKEA) that contains 32 PI build machines and one or two controlling nodes with lots of disk space. The controller will run wanna-build and will host the source repository and built binaries. The build machines will all grab packages from the wanna-build queue, set up a build environment and build them.
Each node needs a Pi (£25), a 32GB SD card (£20), Power supply (£6), Networking (£8), power cabling and shelving (£11) so about £70 per node. 32 nodes sounds like a nice number, which is £2240, the controller nodes and assorted other costs and contingency bring us up to the £2500 target.

Why don't you get a bunch of fast PCs and cross compile?


It really needs to be built on the target architecture, that way packages that test themselves can run the tests in the right way. We also don't want a bunch of screamingly loud fans and lots of heat. The Raspberry Pi runs cool and silent, we think the price/performance is going to be OK too.


Why don't you use QEMU on cloud based computers and do it emulated?


Well that wouldn't be half as much fun.


What happens about packages that fail to build?


Depends why, if they fail to build due to lack of ram or disk space on a buildd then we can set up a beefier buildd with maybe an attached SSD and lots of swap, it might be slow but it should get there. If they fail to build because the code won't compile then we will probably just report a bug and leave it. We don't promise to build every single package.

What happens after it is done?

Well there is always more to build with a new Ubuntu distribution every 6 months. We would be very happy to use the cluster for other things too, if someone has a great idea and can give us some code to run on it then great, lets do that! It probably isn't going to be the future of Bitcoin mining, but if you want to do some experimental stuff that needs lots of modestly powered nodes then we are open to all suggestions.

We will build a smaller cluster, it will take longer to build things, we might have to scale back the number of packages built, but we will still do something cool.

<p>Roommates
is a smartphone social app dedicated to anyone chooses to live under the same
roof. Roommates has been created to solve the problems raised by those
cohabitations.  Who has never had a
shitty roommate? Most of the time is hard to distinguish a good one from a bad
one.</p>
<p>We
want to solve those problems. The app in fact associates to every user a “Roommate-Gamer-Card”
which is representative of the reputation and reliability of the user, so that
you could check on a possible future roommate and choose if you want to rent him
your free room.</p>
<p>You
could also manage the house’s chores thanks to the social-side of the app and try
to use the Roommates’ features to avoid silly fights with your pals.</p>

<p>We
started working on it as an android project, but soon we faced some
difficulties. First of all we saw that we would need money for a solid server
interface, for the server themselves and for the expenses of a proper working
place. </p>
<p>For
now we’re working in our garage (yes I know It’s a cliché but it’s true,
unfortunately) and we’re trying to do as much as we can. </p>
<p>Without
fund we could not improve some important features, such as an integrated ads system
which could help users to publish for FREE their ads to search for a house or a
roommate. </p>
<p>Without
fund we could not develop a proper iOS version of the app, making the app
worthless for the people who doesn’t possess an android device</p>

<p>Thanks
to the app you could get a better cohabitation with your roommates. No more
fights. No more post it on the fridge to tell your roommate to empty the trash
can. No more coming back home and find out there is an unauthorized party in
your room. </p>
<p>Thanks
to Roommates you could:</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>manage your shitty roommates</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>manage a chores calendar</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>vote your worst or best roommate with a reputation
to warn his or her future roommates</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>improve your own reputation and show it
to your landlord as a reference of your behavior</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>take the cohabitation as a game, where
you could earn points for good behaviors</p>

<p>Our
project is important because we were students in Rome and, after years of
forced cohabitations, we were tired of some people’s behavior. We were tired of
living with people who didn’t want to clean the house, who didn’t remember to
pay the bills. We were tired of people who ate your lunch for mistakes and tired
of not having a place were we could check or even choose our roommates. </p>
<p>Of
course, we are not asking money just for the sake of it.  We are already funding this by ourselves but
we need help. We need help because after two whole years in Ericsson Italy, developing
apps and videogame for big societies, we want to develop what we want, a
project like this that we believe in. </p>

<p></p></div>","Short Summary
Roommates
is a smartphone social app dedicated to anyone chooses to live under the same
roof. Roommates has been created to solve the problems raised by those
cohabitations.  Who has never had a
shitty roommate? Most of the time is hard to distinguish a good one from a bad
one.
We
want to solve those problems. The app in fact associates to every user a “Roommate-Gamer-Card”
which is representative of the reputation and reliability of the user, so that
you could check on a possible future roommate and choose if you want to rent him
your free room.
You
could also manage the house’s chores thanks to the social-side of the app and try
to use the Roommates’ features to avoid silly fights with your pals.
What We Need
We
started working on it as an android project, but soon we faced some
difficulties. First of all we saw that we would need money for a solid server
interface, for the server themselves and for the expenses of a proper working
place. 
For
now we’re working in our garage (yes I know It’s a cliché but it’s true,
unfortunately) and we’re trying to do as much as we can. 
Without
fund we could not improve some important features, such as an integrated ads system
which could help users to publish for FREE their ads to search for a house or a
roommate. 
Without
fund we could not develop a proper iOS version of the app, making the app
worthless for the people who doesn’t possess an android device
What You Get
Thanks
to the app you could get a better cohabitation with your roommates. No more
fights. No more post it on the fridge to tell your roommate to empty the trash
can. No more coming back home and find out there is an unauthorized party in
your room. 
Thanks
to Roommates you could:
· 
manage your shitty roommates
· 
manage a chores calendar
· 
vote your worst or best roommate with a reputation
to warn his or her future roommates
· 
improve your own reputation and show it
to your landlord as a reference of your behavior
· 
take the cohabitation as a game, where
you could earn points for good behaviors
The Impact
Our
project is important because we were students in Rome and, after years of
forced cohabitations, we were tired of some people’s behavior. We were tired of
living with people who didn’t want to clean the house, who didn’t remember to
pay the bills. We were tired of people who ate your lunch for mistakes and tired
of not having a place were we could check or even choose our roommates. 
Of
course, we are not asking money just for the sake of it.  We are already funding this by ourselves but
we need help. We need help because after two whole years in Ericsson Italy, developing
apps and videogame for big societies, we want to develop what we want, a
project like this that we believe in.

<h3>Hi there!</h3>
<p>I'm Patty Jean Robinson, and like my father before me, I like to smash cars in an arena where people can cheer me on and have my blood boil just so I can smack the crap out of someone else's car. HULKSMASH ON WHEELS.</p>
<p>This campaign is to fund the building of a derby car so that I can participate this August in the <a href=""http://www.placervillespeedway.com/2013/news/03/13a.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Placerville Speedway News "">40th Annual Hangtown Destruction Derby</a> in Placerville, CA.</p>
<p>Your donations will help me and my dad, (well mostly my dad and my brother), build an awesome derby car to smash and crash, and to get us to the derby.</p>
<h3>
<br/>We're Hoping to Raise $5,000</h3>
<p>I had no idea how much it costs to build a derby car. All this time, my dad had access to used cars and borrowed equipment. Now that I want to do this on my own, I need some help as this stuff adds up! Here's a bit of a breakdown:</p>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Car - $1000</li>
<li>Miller Welder -  $1,087.00</li>
<li>Gas bottle   -   $240.00</li>
<li>Welding cart  -  $150.00</li>
<li>Torches kit -  $245.00</li>
<li>Oxygen bottle -  $340.00</li>
<li>Acet Bottle -   $280.00</li>
<li>Car battery - $204.00(2 needed)     </li>
<li>Miscellaneous Parts (nuts/bolts etc,etc.) - $400.00</li>
<li>Car tires/rims  -  $500.00</li>
<li>Transportation/Gas/Food/Camping for a 3 day trip:  $800.00 (includes trailer rental)</li>
<li>Entry Fee to derby- $50.00</li>
<li>Tires for the car hauling truck-$600.00/$800.00</li>
</ul>
<div>The parts/tires include other needed parts: radiator, bumpers(if needed), carburetor, distributor, oil, and that kind of stuff. If we raise $5,000 or more that will afford me a new firesuit and helmet, (instead of borrowing my brother's), a nifty paint job for the car, a pop up tent that will protect Dad &amp; Rocky from the sun while they build the car. The more raised, the more Tools can be unlocked.</div>

We're Hoping to Raise $5,000
I had no idea how much it costs to build a derby car. All this time, my dad had access to used cars and borrowed equipment. Now that I want to do this on my own, I need some help as this stuff adds up! Here's a bit of a breakdown:



Car - $1000
Miller Welder -  $1,087.00
Gas bottle   -   $240.00
Welding cart  -  $150.00
Torches kit -  $245.00
Oxygen bottle -  $340.00
Acet Bottle -   $280.00
Car battery - $204.00(2 needed)     
Miscellaneous Parts (nuts/bolts etc,etc.) - $400.00
Car tires/rims  -  $500.00
Transportation/Gas/Food/Camping for a 3 day trip:  $800.00 (includes trailer rental)
Entry Fee to derby- $50.00
Tires for the car hauling truck-$600.00/$800.00

The parts/tires include other needed parts: radiator, bumpers(if needed), carburetor, distributor, oil, and that kind of stuff. If we raise $5,000 or more that will afford me a new firesuit and helmet, (instead of borrowing my brother's), a nifty paint job for the car, a pop up tent that will protect Dad & Rocky from the sun while they build the car. The more raised, the more Tools can be unlocked.
Perks
Well just what do you get in return? Aside from my never ending gratitude,
 
$5 - Thank you on Facebook and Twitter, and any other social media outlet I can get my hands on. 
$10 - Thank you on The Internets & your name on my car!
$25 - Thanks, and you can ask a question from me or my dad, and get a video response.
$50 - Thanks, a video response from either my dad or me, and a 15 minute Google Hangout with us. 
$75 - All of the above, a patch of the dragon that will hopefully be painted on Patty's car, made by Patty's Mom. Aww.  
$100 - All of the above and a dvd of the Big Day, shot and edited by my Awesome videographer of a brother, Rocky. 
$150 - All of the above and tix for 2 to watch the derby in the grandstands. (Bring sun block as it is usually very sunny. But bring something just in case it rains.) You must provide your own transportation to Placerville, CA. 
$200 All of the above and tix to the driver's pit area!! (You get to hang out and watch every one work on their cars and be up close and personal with the destruction. Ooooh).  If you go to the pits, you need to wear long pants and shoes. No sandals. Safety First! You must provide your own transportation to Placerville, CA. 
$500.00 - All of the above and you can camp with us on Saturday night, (includes a bar-b-q that night, and a breakfast at the Veterans Hall the next morning. All part of our Placerville Derby Tradition). Good for 2 people for each donation.
$1000 - All of the above and you can help pre-bend my derby car. That's right, you can HulkSmash my car with a sledge hammer. 

What happens if I don't make my goal?
If I'm unable to raise the $5k, I would like to use the funds raised to give back to the community. I would split it between


The Placerville Police Officer's Association - that's what the whole event is for
Red Cross - There's been so much going on lately.
If there's any leftover, I'd like to get my dad at least one new tire for his truck, as we blew one of them out going to the derby last year.



Why Is This So Important To You, Patty?
Because I have never known a greater thrill, a higher high, than to drive in a demolition derby. It's where I can turn into The Fearless Gladiator, look The Big Bad straight in the eye and yell, ""COME ON YOU BITCH! COME ON!!!"" (That's exactly what I did in 2009). Why? Because last year, when I watched friends compete, my heart quickened, my adrenaline shot up, and I wanted to be in the arena so bad I could taste it. Why?

<p></p>
<p>This uniquely
designed instrument enables wireless connection between smart phone and an EleUke
using bluetooth which can be used to enjoy karaoke play along with practicing
or live performances.</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Made up of solid
wood and carpentered with CNC machine, EleUke has one more variation made up of
plastic injection mould technique, priced lower than the wood body. Bluetooth
EleUke
has similar concept as traditional electric guitar but has
different
function with earphone output so that one can
play or practice without bothering anybody in night time.</span><br/></p>
</div><div>Below is Bluetooth EleUke's basic concept diagram.</div><div>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span></p>
<p>EleUke, a newly
designed instrument works best when connected with a smart phone using
bluetooth. All the operations of Bluetooth EleUke like start &amp; stop,
volume turn up &amp; down of a track etc. can be controlled using a smart
phone. Furthermore, its volume &amp; tone can be controlled by using independent
knobs on EleUke. The
instrument comes with 3.7V 500mA rechargeable battery that can be charged with
the help of an USB cable of smart phone charger.</p>
<p>Bluetooth
module installed in EleUke automatically turns on when 1/4” jack or earphone
jack is plugged in and becomes ready to connect with smart phone, which needs
to connect with EleUke’s bluetooth by pairing both the devices.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary Philip.K musical instrument inventor launched to make a new concept instrument named Bluetooth EleUke project.

This uniquely
designed instrument enables wireless connection between smart phone and an EleUke
using bluetooth which can be used to enjoy karaoke play along with practicing
or live performances.
Made up of solid
wood and carpentered with CNC machine, EleUke has one more variation made up of
plastic injection mould technique, priced lower than the wood body. Bluetooth
EleUke
has similar concept as traditional electric guitar but has
different
function with earphone output so that one can
play or practice without bothering anybody in night time.
Below is Bluetooth EleUke's basic concept diagram.


EleUke, a newly
designed instrument works best when connected with a smart phone using
bluetooth. All the operations of Bluetooth EleUke like start & stop,
volume turn up & down of a track etc. can be controlled using a smart
phone. Furthermore, its volume & tone can be controlled by using independent
knobs on EleUke. The
instrument comes with 3.7V 500mA rechargeable battery that can be charged with
the help of an USB cable of smart phone charger.
Bluetooth
module installed in EleUke automatically turns on when 1/4” jack or earphone
jack is plugged in and becomes ready to connect with smart phone, which needs
to connect with EleUke’s bluetooth by pairing both the devices.




Born and raised in Korea, Philip. K is an  inventor and designer for acoustic musical instruments. He has already launched
and successfully completed another Indiegogo campaign for BugsGear brand
soprano & concert size plastic Ukulele.

<h3><strong>Brilliant flashes of blinding light with blasts of ultrasonic waves (only audible to deer) scatter deer as if running “for their lives”!</strong></h3>
<p>DeerRepeller provides you the best protection by combining ultra-bright flashes of light with powerful blasts of ultrasonic waves (not audible to humans) triggered by infrared motion detection, all solar powered and mounted on a ground stake!  No wires, no mounting, no problem!</p>
<p>In addition to all that powerful artillery, the system alerts other ""field units"" of an intruder through its built-in radio communication gear.  When one unit “fires” a blast of light and ultrasonic sound, the other units ""fire"" simultaneously as well!  It drives the deer “crazy with fright”.  Poof! They are gone!</p>
<p>Just push the attractive strobe stake into the center of your flower bed or garden, and you’re protected. It’s that simple!</p>
<p>DeerRepeller is powered by the sun like your flowers and is equipped with a heat-triggered strobe light that blasts brief but brilliant flares of light and ultrasound whenever deer come close.  Unlike conventional yard lights that gently show the deer where their food source is, the startling light and sound “shots” from DeerRepeller will effectively and reliably provide the ultimate deer repellent.</p>
<p>Best of all, unlike other light “deterrents” that are hidden some safe distance from the area to be protected, DeerRepeller is boldly positioned in the center of your garden, prepared to blast any intruding deer the instant they come close from any direction.</p>
<p>Any human intruder will also be detected, and the homeowner can be immediately alerted via the optional remote wireless internet-caller module.</p>
<p>Please Note: The product is currently in development, and all images are professional drawings of the proposed final design.</p>
<p> </p>
<div class=""template asset""> <img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/638/736/1c772638cf4e8ce2a66339ce4fc3075d_large.JPG?1370154134"" src="""" style=""""/>
</div>
<p>DeerRepeller is also a must for improving home security.  One flash is normally all it takes to scare off any potential human burglar or night time intruder. – Who knows…, <strong><em>“Did someone just take a picture of me?”</em></strong><span>  Because the system itself is self-contained, you can stick it into any remote ground location you are concerned about.  All it needs are six hours of good sunlight to recharge its internal batteries, and it is ready to protect 24/7. </span></p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/638/745/7266515d80c5fd03d7bc2995225d30b1_large.JPG?1370154701"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Finally, DeerRepeller combines the best features of other existing products, such as the common solar powered garden lamp, a PIR, Passive Infrared (body heat), surveillance detector, ultrasonic pest control, and unit-to-unit radio communication.  What a wonderful winning combination!</p>
<p>Below is a block diagram showing the many functional modules inside each unit that make it all happen.  As you can see, the intruder detector, the DeerRepeller, is sophisticated and complex technology.</p>
<p> <img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/873852/pictures/original/20130615222525-New_Image.JPG?1371360328"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 150px;""> </p>
<p>Fully ready for its mission, just drive the stake into the center of any area that you want protected.  The PIR sensor, Passive Infrared sensor, covers a 360 degree area and approximately 25 foot radius (see drawing below), so there is NO sneaking up on it; sensitivity can be user adjusted.</p>

<h3 class=""dotty""><em>Product Accessories:</em></h3>
<p><strong>Command and </strong><strong>Control Center</strong>--The Control Center is a remotely mounted tactical information center with a lighted display.  The remote Control Center communicates with the field units by radio waves.  Critical tactical information is transmitted 24/7 by the field units to the Control Center so the intelligence officer (you) can properly assess battlefield conditions.  The Command and Control Center displays the number of intrusions that have occurred and were ""fired"" upon during any given time period.  Other critical operation information will be displayed such as ammunition supply level of each of the field units (power level of each field unit's batteries).  The intelligence officer (you) can set alarm thresholds if need be, such as an alarm if the power level of a field unit is too low to protect an area.</p>
<p> <strong>Delta-Force Surveillance Module</strong>--For even larger areas to be secured, you need the help of the Delta-Force Surveillance Module. The module is a remote PIR surveillance device which is strategically placed in known traffic areas, such as a corner, where deer or an intruder might enter your yard.  If an intruder is detected, a radio signal is sent to all the field units.  Immediately all units will provide a simultaneous response of heavy ""fire"" with bright light and an ultrasonic shotgun blast.  This event will shock, frighten, and abruptly terminate deer or human intrusion.  It’s like having a firework show in your back yard (but you will not be able to hear the sound--only the deer will).  It’s a sight you've got to see!</p>
<p><strong>Remote Switch</strong>–-A wireless activation and deactivation switch is an option.  This can be used to disarm the DeerRepeller system during any such occasion or time period the operator desires for the system not to be in use. </p>
<p>For those who want to stay in the know, an internet camera and alert system can quickly notify you of any DeerRepeller intruder activity. This product development will depend on demand and pledge amount received. </p>

<p>As with any high volume product, there is an inherent risk taking a product from a working prototype state to full mass production. There are two paths we can take depending on funding level.  One is to license it to a company to manufacture and market the product (all awards will given out as well), or we can produce it ourselves!  We are working with an experienced overseas manufacturing expert who has a reputable manufacturing facility in China ready to produce the DeerRepeller.  Since they already have experience in making solar powered yard lamps, the risk should be minimal. They have the full engineering staff to make sure quality remains high and the professionalism to deliver on time. Thus, with such a strong production facility as part of our team, we feel we can deliver high performing products to our supporters.  Our goal is to surpass customer expectations in all areas.  This will be an exciting and fun project to be part of!</p>

DeerRepeller is also a must for improving home security.  One flash is normally all it takes to scare off any potential human burglar or night time intruder. – Who knows…, “Did someone just take a picture of me?”  Because the system itself is self-contained, you can stick it into any remote ground location you are concerned about.  All it needs are six hours of good sunlight to recharge its internal batteries, and it is ready to protect 24/7. 

 
Finally, DeerRepeller combines the best features of other existing products, such as the common solar powered garden lamp, a PIR, Passive Infrared (body heat), surveillance detector, ultrasonic pest control, and unit-to-unit radio communication.  What a wonderful winning combination!
Below is a block diagram showing the many functional modules inside each unit that make it all happen.  As you can see, the intruder detector, the DeerRepeller, is sophisticated and complex technology.
 
 
Fully ready for its mission, just drive the stake into the center of any area that you want protected.  The PIR sensor, Passive Infrared sensor, covers a 360 degree area and approximately 25 foot radius (see drawing below), so there is NO sneaking up on it; sensitivity can be user adjusted.
 


 
Target Features:

Patent Pending-unique design features provide strong team defense.
Completely self-contained with solar-powered detector and strobe light—no need for wiring or mounting; just stake and go!
Built-in motion sensor activates when deer or human invader moves into the coverage zone (approx. 1960 sq. ft.)
Long flash life—over 1,000,000 high intensity flashes (estimated 3 to 5 years of operation)
Soft blue dome light with power indicator inside reveals system readiness when fully charged.
Environmentally safe
Maintenance-free
More cost effective and convenient compared to any fencing arrangement
Rugged ABS plastic design for long life
Allows for full garden/property visibility without unsightly fencing and view obstruction.
Protecting your garden investment saves loss of time and money.
Can also be used to as a nighttime human deterrent.
High power ultrasonic waves blast with corresponding flashes of high intensity light proving effective and reliable 24/7 property defense.
Customer support and consultation for more extreme, unusual, or hostile environments.
 
 
Product Accessories:
Command and Control Center--The Control Center is a remotely mounted tactical information center with a lighted display.  The remote Control Center communicates with the field units by radio waves.  Critical tactical information is transmitted 24/7 by the field units to the Control Center so the intelligence officer (you) can properly assess battlefield conditions.  The Command and Control Center displays the number of intrusions that have occurred and were ""fired"" upon during any given time period.  Other critical operation information will be displayed such as ammunition supply level of each of the field units (power level of each field unit's batteries).  The intelligence officer (you) can set alarm thresholds if need be, such as an alarm if the power level of a field unit is too low to protect an area.
 Delta-Force Surveillance Module--For even larger areas to be secured, you need the help of the Delta-Force Surveillance Module. The module is a remote PIR surveillance device which is strategically placed in known traffic areas, such as a corner, where deer or an intruder might enter your yard.  If an intruder is detected, a radio signal is sent to all the field units.  Immediately all units will provide a simultaneous response of heavy ""fire"" with bright light and an ultrasonic shotgun blast.  This event will shock, frighten, and abruptly terminate deer or human intrusion.  It’s like having a firework show in your back yard (but you will not be able to hear the sound--only the deer will).  It’s a sight you've got to see!
Remote Switch–-A wireless activation and deactivation switch is an option.  This can be used to disarm the DeerRepeller system during any such occasion or time period the operator desires for the system not to be in use. 
For those who want to stay in the know, an internet camera and alert system can quickly notify you of any DeerRepeller intruder activity. This product development will depend on demand and pledge amount received. 
Words from the Founder and Design Director ,Craig Coad:

Craig Coad:  ""As a gardener myself and wanting to have my plants survive to enjoy, we needed to develop a secure way to protect our invesment.  By combining the best technologies available for effectiveness and reliability, we have developed a device we can depend on.  Please join our family team in bringing this wonderful product to all who are concerned about their home security and value their gardens. 
Testimonials:
Neil Soderstrom, well-known gardening expert, nature author/photographer and expert on pest control:
""As a deer scare, your concept for solar-powered strobes, with ultrasound option, sounds promising.  This would be more cost-effective and less labor-intensive than unsightly solar-powered fencing, which of course also becomes a shock hazard for pets and people.  I'd be glad to help with field-testing.""  
Deer are scared of bright and sudden lighting:
“Motion control spotlights can effectively stop deer from eating garden plants”, suggests the National Sustainable Agricultural Information Service.
""What a great product!!!  ""Pam, Founder and CEO of Innovative Product Technologies, Inc.
""I have been a judge in Vegas for the National Lawn and Garden show for a few years... I can tell you that I would vote for that one!!!  ""Pam in Sagle, Idaho
“We have tried everything…”  Tim in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho:
“We sure need a product like this; because I have tried everything else, and nothing else works over the long run!  Even my dog used to scare them (the deer) away, and now he plays with them!”
 
   “I have just about given up…”  Laura in Hayden, Idaho:
“I have tried everything that is legal to keep deer away, but they keep coming!  This will be great to protect my large garden.”
 
Testimonial from Josiah in Sagle, Idaho, a witness to the effectiveness of the working prototype:
 “I was amazed at the effectiveness of protection a power strobe light placed in the center of our family’s flower bed could be!  We had bought about 20 mature and full blooming mum plants (with hundreds of flowers) and placed them in a flower bed near the woods, a place known to have frequent and heavy deer traffic; it was a place where flowers had not survived before.  We put the DeerRepeller in the center of the flower bed.  Even though deer were grazing in our neighbor’s yard, to my amazement, not a single flower of ours was touched!  The deer were around but effectively being kept at bay due to the awesome protection power of the DeerRepeller.”
 
                                              
 
Thank you for partnering with us through your generous investment in helping provide the long-awaited solution to the problem of unwanted deer intruder damage and an effective deterrent to human night invaders as well.  We hope that you will find satisfaction in contributing to providing the opportunity for improving enjoyment and yield for gardeners—including you!—everywhere.  
From the DeerRepeller Product Development and Marketing Team
 

Risks and Challenges:

As with any high volume product, there is an inherent risk taking a product from a working prototype state to full mass production. There are two paths we can take depending on funding level.  One is to license it to a company to manufacture and market the product (all awards will given out as well), or we can produce it ourselves!  We are working with an experienced overseas manufacturing expert who has a reputable manufacturing facility in China ready to produce the DeerRepeller.  Since they already have experience in making solar powered yard lamps, the risk should be minimal. They have the full engineering staff to make sure quality remains high and the professionalism to deliver on time. Thus, with such a strong production facility as part of our team, we feel we can deliver high performing products to our supporters.  Our goal is to surpass customer expectations in all areas.  This will be an exciting and fun project to be part of!

Who am I?
I've been working on this project for a little more than a year now, produced a lot of prototypes to get the result that I am showing to you in this video.
I'm also the creator of www.limpkin.fr , so you can see that I'm very active in the open hardware initiative.
I've already commercialized some products, so it is not the first time that I embark in this kind of adventure!


What is the Toktoktok Project?
The Toktoktok project aims to create a simple, intuitive, and unified interface for all aspects of home automation. This product converts any surface into a touch sensitive input device for home automation purposes. To do so, I propose a cheap, simple-to-use and easy-to-implement box that only needs to be attached to a surface to make it sensitive to user interactions. This new technology is remarkable because it does not require specific indoor conditions to function and provides an intuitive input interface that anyone can use.
You may ask why is that useful? Well, imagine being able to control your home within arm's reach... 



A Patent Free Idea!
I went to the Institute of Intellectual Property in Bern, Switzerland (where Einstein was working), and found that this idea of knock detecting boxes has not been patented.
Therefore, when this idea goes public, it falls into public knowledge and can't be patented anymore. 
Everyone can then use it but also twist it!


So who is it made for and how can you use it?
Toktoktok is made for everyone, as it is so simple to implement. 
But more specifically, it is particularly suited for persons having a low-mobility. So not only will you back an interesting project if you chose to do so, but you will also help elderly people to have a better everyday life.
Currently, the toktoktok system is composed of toktoktok boxes, lamp/power switching sockets and RF receivers for computers.
Therefore, it will allow you to:



add additional switches in convenient places

not spend 10 minutes looking for the light switch, especially if you are in the dark

switch off all electronic devices when leaving the house

control your computer music player from anywhere

quickly turn off your computer (not the hard way ;) ): this is for people (like me) that like watching films from their beds....
simplify your life...

What is wonderful is that you only need to get one toktoktok box to start your toktoktok install.

Power/lamp switching sockets can be bought in your country from various companies, and you can make the computer RF receiver yourself.

That's why I'm asking support to get these toktoktok boxes produced!



The Impact
If successful, I'm confident that this campaign will help toktoktok to be known around the world. 
I really think that if some people like one product, they will talk around them about it and therefore create a growing community of toktoktok enthusiasts.
You can be part of an initiative that may change the way people interact with their homes.
Knocking on one surface is a simple gesture that everyone is already used to!




Toktoktok logo design contest!


Here is the thing: I don't have a logo to put on the toktoktok box.
Therefore, I have decided to let people contributing to this project to propose their design.
Depending on how you contribute to the toktoktok project, you'll be able either to enter the contest or to vote for one design you like.
That's right... I will not have a say in the chosen toktoktok logo!



What I Need & What You Get
Well, I need funds to have a first batch of at least 1000 toktoktok boxes produced, as the interest on this project can only start with products actually built.
Please note that a lot of money will be used to buy the initial tooling required to get the production going. For example, the mould tooling costs 11000$.
Once the production is started, the toktoktok box price will decrease. For your information, a toktoktok box produced in a 10k batch is 3/4 the price of a box produced in a 1k quantity. So this project can only succeed if a lot of people are interested.
The finished product wil be neater than the one shown in the video above, as the production process will not be the same (from rapid prototyping to plastic injection).
Depending on your contribution, you can get presents from Switzerland (yay, chocolates!), get some toktoktok boxes, and even ask for a personalized toktoktok box.




Toktoktok and the open hardware/software initiatives

If the campaign is successfull, all the hardware and software files will be released under a TAPR open hardware license.
I know there are a lot of students out there that would like to play with toktoktok and may not have the money to buy one.
As i also want people to twist the toktoktok idea, everything will be available for you to download!




But wait, what if I dont reach this goal?

Here is what will happen. Since I can't start the project without full funding, if the campaign is not sucessfull, Indiegogo will refund the entire amount to you. So, you can support this project in full confidence. This is my promise to you and it's a risk I am taking.


Other Ways You Can HelpHow can we get people interested in this project?Please help me spread the word to friends, news papers, students and family that you think would be interested in the toktoktok project.  Thank you for reading all this and I hope to shout out your name and a big thank you on the toktoktok facebook page soon!",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><b>FUNDING</b> </p>

<p>We've turned to Indiegogo to open our idea to you in the hope that we can reach more people. And with your support, we can get iKlips DUO to the market much more quickly and cheaply. We can guarantee that those who back us will receive their perks. But the demand we hope to generate here will show that we’re right to commit iKlips to mass production. That means more people will be able to benefit from making it easier to manage their content on the go.</p>
<p><b>BUILDING OUR APP YOUR WAY</b><br/></p>
<p>We also invite your suggestions for building the app that suits how you want to manage your content iOS, which will be available for release in April. We want to improve workflow and manageability, so if you feel that is there anything else you’d like to see, then please contact us so we can build the features we can all benefit from: <u><a href=""mailto:indiegogo@adamelements.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">indiegogo@adamelements.com</a></u></p>

<p></p></div>","Manage iOS your way


Along with increasing iPhone camera capabilities, storage solutions are becoming increasingly important for taking and keeping better quality photos. But is it your iPhone that needs all that storage? With iKlips DUO it’s not about keeping everything on the go. It’s about managing your device better with the content you need when you need it.
Now can easily and securely share your music, photos, videos, work projects, and all your other creations between all your devices – iPhone, iPad, iPad Pro, Mac, and PC. Having the ability to organize, store more and share on the go with friends, family, and colleagues gives you the power to do more on the go.

   EXPANDIt’s a step we’re all familiar with – just plug and play. No need to sign up for a cloud account. No account details to remember. No need to backup with iTunes. Simply insert iKlips DUO into your device, and you’ll be able to expand your storage space on the go. So the next time you’re on vacation or on location doing photography, you’ll have the storage you really need to capture your moment.
   SHAREWith both Apple Lightning and USB 3.1 connectors, iKlips DUO lets you easily and securely share your content between all your devices – iOS, Mac and PC. But it’s not just about storage. It’s about performance. Produced with top quality MLC flash memory, iKlips DUO has the fastest flash memory type for iOS devices. All your music, photos, videos, and other content can be shared in an instant.  




    MANAGE
By using our companion iKlips 2.0 App, you manage iOS your way.  – all on the go. So you can load your iKlips DUO with the content you want from your PC or MAC, and then you can play, watch, listen, and edit your media and work on your device without using its storage. If it’s your HD/Full HD movie to watch on the plane or your HD/Full HD movie project to edit on your iPad, by managing iOS with the content you need, you can do things your way.







Manage iOS your way





iKlips App 2.0 is one half of what makes iKlips DUO even better. It’s an intuitive app that makes using your iKlips DUO an even easier experience, featuring 3D Touch support, multi-select, Split View, Touch ID password protection, Drop To, and even integration with Apple’s Music app to access your iTunes purchases. It's your go-to app for managing the content you want to share and use on the go. But with Airplay integration, it’s also mobile content ready for the big screen. Available for iKlips and iKlips DUO from mid-April.














The DUO you've been waiting for









If you became attached to iKlips the first time round, then you’ll love what we have in store with the new iKlips DUO. With a newly designed Lightning connector body that fits even more iPhone and iPad cases, a silicone body sleeve for total protection, a handy key ring, and a more powerful iOS app than ever before, it's quite the DUO.





Available in four vivid colors and four storage capacities, iKlips DUO has a style and purpose for everyone. When your iPhone is crammed full of photos, music, and games, iKlips DUO gives you the external storage you need – and with a style that complements your device and yourself. Available in 32GB, 64GB, 128GB and 256GB models.Design




A Step-up
It’s a design that’s been perfected to be more practical, with a redesigned Lightning connector stepped body to fit even more iPhone and iPad cases. Use your iKlips DUO and keep your iPhone where it belongs, scratch-free and snug inside the case you love.
Protection All-round
A protective silicone sleeve stretches around both ends of iKlips DUO, giving its connectors the much-needed protection for day-to-day use. And because it wraps around iKlips DUO’s body, losing protective connector caps is now a thing of the past. There’s nothing to lose.
Being Attached
The simplest ideas can be the best. We’ve added a handy key ring, so that you can always keep it close without fear of losing it. Attach it to a keychain on your bag, clothes, or your actual keys. It is an attachment worth having.





Hardware






 

Better connected
With USB 3.1 and a Lightning connector, you can get your content from your iPhone or iPad to your PC or Mac in record time. Make real, physical backups of your precious Camera Roll memories or your iTunes music library. Think of it as your backup for the cloud and as your tool for sharing on the go. It’s better to be connected when and where you need it.

exFAT – no limits
With iKlips DUO, you can forget about limitations. Formatted with exFAT, iKlips DUO doesn’t have restrictions on individual file sizes. Other drives with FAT32 are limited to a measly 4GB per file – not even enough for most HD movies. If you’ve got the capacity, use it how you want. 



MLC Flash memory.

Produced with top quality MLC flash memory, it has the world’s fastest memory for iPhone, iPad, and iPad Pro. Besides enabling greater speeds, it provides greater stability and a longer lifespan. It will last as long as you want it to.

Apple MFi-certified. 
Fully certified and licensed by Apple as a product Made for iPhone, iPad & iPod. Designed specifically for Apple, iKlips Duo meets strict performance and manufacturing standards and is guaranteed  by ADAM elements.














FUNDING 

We've turned to Indiegogo to open our idea to you in the hope that we can reach more people. And with your support, we can get iKlips DUO to the market much more quickly and cheaply. We can guarantee that those who back us will receive their perks. But the demand we hope to generate here will show that we’re right to commit iKlips to mass production. That means more people will be able to benefit from making it easier to manage their content on the go.
BUILDING OUR APP YOUR WAY
We also invite your suggestions for building the app that suits how you want to manage your content iOS, which will be available for release in April. We want to improve workflow and manageability, so if you feel that is there anything else you’d like to see, then please contact us so we can build the features we can all benefit from: indiegogo@adamelements.com

<p>As one of the most deadly diseases, alcoholism is highly dangerous and prevalent. But Alcoholics Anonymous has proven itself time and again to be the best treatment option. Even then, its success rate is mediocre at best: The majority of AA members leave the program -- and many of them don’t stay on this planet much longer than that. With meetings worldwide and over 2 million members, there is no shortage of an AA community, but there is a dire shortage of tools to help members find help and support in the most effective way.</p>

</ul><h3 dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height: 1.15; margin-top: 14pt; margin-bottom: 4pt;""> </h3>
<p><strong>HOW WILL WE DO THIS?</strong> Thanks for asking!</p>
<p><br/>This will be done in a few ways. The first is by going to local businesses and having them advertise with <strong>Condoms are Cool</strong>. Their is going to be a number of ways to do this as well, the first being on the condom wrapper itself. We will place the business logo and advertisement of its choice on the outside of package. Making sure of course no damage is done to the packaging. Ads can be anything the company would like to advertise from coupons to slogans. I will offer different options upon request such as flyers, leaflets etc. in any case the revenue raised from the ads will help fund free condoms as well as other business expenses.</p>
<h3 dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height: 1.15; margin-top: 14pt; margin-bottom: 4pt;""> </h3>
<p>I am offering zones in which companies can target there ads to be placed, such as, downtown and maybe NE Minneapolis for instance, they would be charged for each zone and the amount of circulation of condoms desired to be dispensed at local events. For example a concert or Friday night during bar hours etc. Say a company wanted to advertise on 1000 condoms in those two zones it would be spread out at a number of places by me and other volunteers. Therefore giving 1000 condoms out for free but giving a local business a possible new or returning customer.</p>
<h3 dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height: 1.15; margin-top: 14pt; margin-bottom: 4pt;""> </h3>
<p> </p>
<h3 dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height: 1.15; margin-top: 14pt; margin-bottom: 4pt;""> </h3>
<p>I am in the process of getting a website built that will be interactive for the guest with blogs and other information on how to get these condoms and where they will be. I will be putting advertisements for businesses on the website as well as opening that up to other advertisement opportunities which will create additional and substantial revenue.</p>
<h3 dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height: 1.15; margin-top: 14pt; margin-bottom: 4pt;""> </h3>
<p>All the while focusing on distributing condoms to the public for free. One thing I plan to do as well and something that this fundraiser could really help with is to make a type of vending machine that would give out free condoms at a specific location 24 hours a day. This is something that I won't be able to do unless I had some help from you all at <strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">indiegogo.com</span></strong></p>
<h3 dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height: 1.15; margin-top: 14pt; margin-bottom: 4pt;""> </h3>
<p><strong>The reason I am doing this?</strong> Why not? Also sex should be free safe or not. I just want to help people that's the bottom line!</p>

I had to get condoms and lubricant  alongwith  some other non related items.  Well as I realized that the other non related items with the lube added up to just about what I had left in cash, in hand I started to negotiate in my head what items to put back and which to keep. What amazed me was that of all of the items I could put back, I chose the condoms!! HOLD UP! Wait one second... Now why did I chose the one potential  thing protecting my life?  I wanted to give it up because it cost nearly $7.00 for 3 condoms! I tried to justify in my mind that I didn’t really need to buy the condoms. Fortunately for me I realized that the  $7.00 was not worth keeping compared, to the price of  becoming HIV +. </span></p>

But still it should be safe if desired.</span></p>

Every year countless people around the world become infected with an STD or become HIV positive as well as young teens  who become parents too early.  I believe that there are many communities  that are being unfairly managed when it comes to accessibility of free condoms such as low income or sexually active  teenagers.  I am not picking on the low income communities because I think they have a disadvantage to safer sex practices but urge look at any community, and you will see that there are not enough condoms being given out by government agencies (no offense I think ya'll are doing awesome!) their just always seems to be funding issues. </span></p>

This is a preview business plan for Condoms are Cool
 
Objectives
 

To make condoms accessible to anyone who would like them and give them away for free
To help anyone who is afraid to go buy them or just unable to buy them a chance to protect themselves. 
In the heat of the moment on the way out of a club you might see someone passing them out. Just in case you forgot to stop by the store. Here's one on us.
 
HOW WILL WE DO THIS? Thanks for asking!
This will be done in a few ways. The first is by going to local businesses and having them advertise with Condoms are Cool. Their is going to be a number of ways to do this as well, the first being on the condom wrapper itself. We will place the business logo and advertisement of its choice on the outside of package. Making sure of course no damage is done to the packaging. Ads can be anything the company would like to advertise from coupons to slogans. I will offer different options upon request such as flyers, leaflets etc. in any case the revenue raised from the ads will help fund free condoms as well as other business expenses.
 
I am offering zones in which companies can target there ads to be placed, such as, downtown and maybe NE Minneapolis for instance, they would be charged for each zone and the amount of circulation of condoms desired to be dispensed at local events. For example a concert or Friday night during bar hours etc. Say a company wanted to advertise on 1000 condoms in those two zones it would be spread out at a number of places by me and other volunteers. Therefore giving 1000 condoms out for free but giving a local business a possible new or returning customer.
 
 
 
I am in the process of getting a website built that will be interactive for the guest with blogs and other information on how to get these condoms and where they will be. I will be putting advertisements for businesses on the website as well as opening that up to other advertisement opportunities which will create additional and substantial revenue.
 
All the while focusing on distributing condoms to the public for free. One thing I plan to do as well and something that this fundraiser could really help with is to make a type of vending machine that would give out free condoms at a specific location 24 hours a day. This is something that I won't be able to do unless I had some help from you all at indiegogo.com
 
The reason I am doing this? Why not? Also sex should be free safe or not. I just want to help people that's the bottom line!
 
Thank you for checking out Condoms are Cool on indiegogo.comPlease feel free to donate to help make this a reality! If you can't donate please spread the word and use the indiegogo share tools on Facebook etc. or just tell someone you know. This could save someone's life someday.

Hello Everybody!!
Have you ever been in the situation where you were shopping for those things  we never like to speak of? 
 
You know, those things for.... um sex... Yes you know what I am talking about!! CONDOMS! Dun dun dun... So now that I have said the uncomfortable word... condom, hopefully we can talk about more important issues regarding them, Like their price for instance!
 
 Hi I am Thomas James Sederberg and I am a 29 yo guy living in Minneapolis, Minnesota and I recently was at the store purchasing those things that no one ever likes to speak of (condoms in case you weren't listening) and I had a dilema... I had to get condoms and lubricant  alongwith  some other non related items.  Well as I realized that the other non related items with the lube added up to just about what I had left in cash, in hand I started to negotiate in my head what items to put back and which to keep. What amazed me was that of all of the items I could put back, I chose the condoms!! HOLD UP! Wait one second... Now why did I chose the one potential  thing protecting my life?  I wanted to give it up because it cost nearly $7.00 for 3 condoms! I tried to justify in my mind that I didn’t really need to buy the condoms. Fortunately for me I realized that the  $7.00 was not worth keeping compared, to the price of  becoming HIV +. 
Now I asked myself.. why should something that is my right as a human being to have, SEX, be anything but how it is intended naturally to be.... yep people, I'm talking about SEX!  And SEX should be FREE! But still it should be safe if desired.
 
My reason to put myself out on Indieogogo.com is that I am starting a business as well as to make condoms accessable to everyone who wants them for absolutely free! Every year countless people around the world become infected with an STD or become HIV positive as well as young teens  who become parents too early.  I believe that there are many communities  that are being unfairly managed when it comes to accessibility of free condoms such as low income or sexually active  teenagers.  I am not picking on the low income communities because I think they have a disadvantage to safer sex practices but urge look at any community, and you will see that there are not enough condoms being given out by government agencies (no offense I think ya'll are doing awesome!) their just always seems to be funding issues. 
Well, I am proposing and am in the process of getting local businesses together that have some advertising leeway that want to access new clients/customers with a different medium of advertising to go where few have gone before, right in the condom package. I am going to utilize these businesses to advertise THEIR business on the condom with an ad.  So now there can be ads to, for example: $5 off your next meal or 50% of next oil change on the package of condoms.  Advertising on these will be very benneficial to those businesses because for one it is promoting a healthy and safe sex life as well get there name out there.  Even if there is no intent to use the condom at first, one might hang on to a ""free drink"" ticket, in turn, helping the advertiser and potentially keeping someone from throwing it away and possibly having a condom for the next romantic experience.  
I am so passionate about doing this as my business because its a great cause that can potentially save lives and/or futures.  
 
Now the part I'm sure you have all been waiting for... I will be going around with other volunteers to pass out these free condoms at permitted events such as bars and nightclubs, concerts and just on the corner of the street so people have more access to these sources (many many other avenues for them to be given out as well)
 
 I don't think the condom companies should be without their payment, they are a business after all and thats why my advertising as well as the group of followers I feel that will grasp this idea of change, which will be additionally funded by donations, will go to covering the purchase and printing costs for condoms and advertising.
 
I am so excited for the opportunity to not let anyone play ""russian roulette"" with there life over not being able to buy the protection they need.  
What I am asking for from the Indiegogo platform here is to come up with some starting up business/movement funds for initial start up.  $10,000 I feel will help out a cause that is bigger than any one person.  This will help everyone who wants it, I am not going to stop my personal journey and mission to bring condoms to the masses for free and as we grow as a business and grow as a movement towards our right to love our bodies with or without access to money at that time.... even if you have money there may come a time you don't have 4 quarters to put in the machine at the gas station or u don't have the time to go get condoms during the heat of the moment, but if you already had them because someone put them in your hand at the bar earlier that night or as you were walking down the street that afternoon then maybe, just maybe you will use it!
This is my goal and I hope to for everyone to have the opportunity to have sex as close to free as it was always intended.
 
If you are unable to donate I still need you your help if you believe in my mission! Please spread the word of what i'm doing and you can see some of my updates on facebook  under    Condoms are Cool    
For those of you who are able to donate, Thank you so much for your generosity! Every single dollar could help indirectly save the life of stranger someday!

<p>Sinookas is a private content-delivery platform you host yourself that unlocks the GPS-potential of your mobile devices without having to trust or depend on third-party services. It's a two-part system, an open-source web interface and a commercial mobile application, that allows you to replicate and customize common tasks, both single- and multi-user, found in many of today's popular apps, including but not-by-any-means limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Messengers</li>
<li>Geocaching</li>
<li>Shopping lists</li>
<li>Daily Planners</li>
<li>Tour guides</li>
<li>Map services</li>
<li>Trackers</li>
</ul>
<p>Sinookas takes advantage of the fact that many content-driven applications are very similar from a functional perspective. The major differences are things like how content is viewed, who can create content, how are pieces of content related, and in many cases simply what content is called. In other words, they are rehashed and repackaged ideas.</p>
<p>Sinookas abstracts these differences away giving you the control to create your own services and customize the behavior, look, and feel of your mobile device via a browser interface. It is flexible and highly configurable, but it's only as complicated as you want it to be. There are increasing levels of involvement from running a turn-key application that you never think about or touch all the way on down to manually extending the platform programmatically. <a href=""#works"" name=""examples"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_self"">See below for more details</a>.</p>
<p>Because the backend is open-source, you can host an instance yourself anywhere you'd like.

<p>This is a service that I've wanted to exist for a few years, so I've finally decided to do it myself.</p>

<h3> <a name=""needs"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">What I Need &amp; What You Get</a>
</h3>
<p>I've already been working on the project for 3 months, so a lot of progress has been made. Other than slight tweaks here-and-there, the web interface/backend is complete. I've built a quick prototype for Android™ to test the content creation and retrieval mechanisms so I know I can deliver Sinookas in a realistic time frame.</p>
<p>I've paid for hosting, domains, and TLS/SSL certificates, so the $5,041 goal will cover the cost of the bare minimum viable product, primarily going towards development time and covering the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shipping the Sinookas platform, both the web and Android applications</li>
<li>Increasing test coverage to 90-95% (currently at 67% for the web application and ~40% for the mobile application)</li>
<li>Writing setup and usage instructions</li>
<li>Creating video tutorials</li>
<li>Finishing the developer documentation</li>
<li>Seeking legal counsel</li>
</ul>
<p>Because so much more can be done to improve Sinookas, the perks are arranged in a modular way giving you influence over the direction the platform will take once the first stage is complete. Think of them as a voting system. </p>
<p>These are what I am putting the highest priority on, in no particular order:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating a Windows Phone app</li>
<li>Creating an iOS app</li>
<li>Building an ""installer""</li>
</ul>
<p>Lower-priority features I would like to implement eventually:</p>
<ul>
<li>Subscription/payment hooks so you have the option to earn money with a service you create</li>
<li>Sign in to multiple services from multiple hosts simultaneously</li>
<li>Integrate content with a publicly facing web view</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these features and goals have a corresponding $1 perk that behaves simply as a vote and a more expensive perk that unconditionally determines the next phases Sinookas will take. The upper-tier perks will be honored in a first-come basis and will trump the voting system. However I believe strongly in listening to users' requests and will otherwise prioritize further development according to the voting results. (One exception is the iOS app which will only be honored if the cost of an OSx computer is covered).</p>
<p>Other things I'm considering doing if enough interest is expressed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating a Wordpress plugin</li>
<li>Porting the backend to Ruby on Rails</li>
</ul>
<p>Should the project not reach its goal, I will still finish the project because this is something I want to use, but I can't guarantee <i>when </i>it will be launched. And of course I will keep any backers updated on progress being made.</p>

<h3> <a name=""impact"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Impact (Serious version)</a>
</h3>
<p>Sinookas is important for those who are concerned about privacy and wish to minimize their digital footprint without sacrificing the advantages technology brings. At such an early stage in the globalized, interconnected era, it's difficult, if not impossible, to predict what effect such open and easy access to our personal data will have. There's often a trade-off between protecting ourselves and our data and taking advantage of the tools and services that pop up so quickly in this age. </p>
<p>On one hand, keeping up with the terms and service (TOS) of one application as it changes is difficult enough. Keeping up with the terms and services of all your applications (Web, mobile, desktop, wearable, vehicular, etc) with all their affiliated legal documents approaches on the impossible.</p>
<p>On the other hand and regardless of TOS, sites get hacked. People get doxxed. Information is leaked. These things aren't necessarily malicious, but accidents happen.</p>
<p>Sinookas makes it so you don't have to choose between privacy/security and technology. The only person you have to trust to keep your information and your family's information safe is yourself--well, and maybe your web host depending on how you set things up.</p>

</div>
<div>
<h3> <a name=""impact2"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Impact (Not-so-serious version)</a>
</h3>
<p>While it's great for all the security-minded reasons above, it's not all doom-and-gloom! In fact Sinookas originated as the engine of a kid's book I'm writing.</p>
<p>Aside from plenty of single-user tasks, it's also intended for multiple users: think private services for you and your friends or colleagues what you might not want the rest of the world to see ;-) </p>
<p>Be creative. There's lots of ways you can make Sinookas stupid and/or fun :)</p>
<p><a href=""#top"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_self"">Back to the top</a></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3> <a name=""risks"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Risks &amp; Challenges</a>
</h3>
<p>Because of the nature of Sinookas, there is nothing really groundbreaking about its functionality, so the technological hurdles are minimal. It's not a matter of whether these things are possible, it's a matter of when they will be finished. And as I mentioned above, I've already finished the backend and started on the mobile app. So conservatively, I'm confident I can release Sinookas by May. In a worse case scenario with unforeseen difficulties, I would release a beta version to the backers at that time.</p>
<p>I've never developed for Windows Phone or iOS. To be honest I've never even programmed in C# or Objective-C--the languages required by those platforms, respectively. So there will be a bit of overhead as I port Sinookas to those operating systems. For those of you with no programming experience, that's not nearly as problematic as it sounds. It's common to have to switch to new languages for different projects. (As a comparison, the first time I ever tried developing for Android, I was able to turn my phone into audio controls for my PC in about 6 hours including download, installation, and reading documentation).</p>
<p>For the developers interested in extending the platform, I got the idea at a late stage to use HTTP Options to transmit meta-information about how fields should be rendered on the frontend. It's very basic at the moment, mostly just data type and whether a field is required or not when creating or updating. A more useful implementation will require a fairly significant refactoring which I don't plan to do for the first release.</p>

<h3> <a name=""works"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">How it works</a>
</h3>
<div>(Videos demonstrations will be uploaded soon.)</div>
<div>
<h4> <a name=""overview"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Overview</a>
</h4>
<p>In the most simple case, a user follows a three-step setup wizard, optionally skipping the second step, and selects from a list of 10 preset configurations to setup a working app with minimal effort in a matter of minutes.</p>
<p>More involved users can use the default services as templates, tweak the behavior, mix and match parts as they desire, or even skip the wizard all together and try building a service by hand from the ground up.</p>
<p>Developers will have the opportunity to extend the platform even further by taking advantage of hooks to create their own data models and queries then registering them with the API. The administration panel will detect them automatically and include further configuration, display, and settings options.</p>
<p>The truly adventurous won't even need to use the backend at all. The documentation will specify everything you need in case you want to start from scratch and communicate directly with the mobile app.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h4> <a name=""contenttypes"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Content Types</a>
</h4>
<p>Sinookas is a content-driven application, so most of its power and flexibility comes from fine-tuning the behavior of content. There are currently three categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Content: this is the core piece of, well, content. Often it is the center-point of a service
                <br/>Examples: messages, ingredients, historical sites</li>
<li>Content Groups: these are exactly what they sound like: groups of content.
                <br/>Examples: conversations, recipes, tour guides</li>
<li>Meta-Content: content about/connected to other content or content groups.
                <br/>Examples: Away messages, tips, warnings</li>
</ul>
<p>These categories are essentially text, geospatial information, and a file attachment with some additional information for each. You also find other attributes commonly found with digital data like the author, time-date information (publish, expiration, and deletion dates), who can view the content, who has viewed it, view counts, visibility rules, and some others.</p>
<p>You tailor the behavior by creating specific instances of each category, called Content Types, where you define default values and control what users can see and edit. It's a ridiculously simple idea, but a lot of ""different"" services and tasks can be squeezed out by changing minor things.</p>
<p>For example, take a shopping list, just a group of food items. It's a very basic Content Group. By allowing other people to contribute, the shopping list becomes dynamic so your family or roommates can add to it from wherever they are. But any list that accepts input from multiple users is functionally no different than a private messenger service. Because we're consenting adults, all it takes is to <i>just rename  </i> ""shopping list"" and ""food item"" to ""conversation"" and ""message"" to create the illusion of a different service. There are more subtle changes you can make to improve the user experience, but this is just a demonstration.</p>
<p>Then by enabling GPS-data for each of these, your shopping list alerts you to pick something up as you walk by a store and a location-dependent messenger where you continue conversations based on where you are.</p>
<p>Alternatively, requiring users to provide publish and expiration dates shifts the behavior from geospatial notifications to temporal ones, or in other words, a reminder system, the basis for daily planners, todo lists, project management, calendars. etc. etc.</p>
<p>Little tweaks open up lots of possibilities. Be creative. Ask yourself questions. What effect does adding users to a service have? What could a a maximum view count be used for? Does changing the order of content matter? What happens when all messages have the same value for X? What do you get when you limit titles to 140 characters? What happens when all content has a required duration after which it is no longer available? Why would I want all active users to be visible on the map?</p>
</div>
<div>
<h4> <a name=""services"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Services</a>
</h4>
<p>Once the content types are set up, you build your service. These are more general rules that tie everything together. You can require all activity to take place in certain geographic reasons, and if so, whether the map should be viewable. You set how often users can search and how fast users can travel--intended to protect against cheating and bots but maybe there are other uses?</p>
<p>Under certain circumstances users are considered to be a special type of content, so here you can define what should be visible and editable.</p>
<p>It's also where you include and exclude the content types you've created. You determine whether users can create content or just read it. For geospatial content, you define how far away a user must be to detect content.</p>
<p>You also have the opportunity to change the color scheme and some labels here.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h4> <a name=""globalsettings"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Global Settings</a>
</h4>
<p>Each Sinookas server can run multiple services simultaneously. Global settings are rules that apply to all of your services (e.g., the name of your server, a description, terms of service[if applicable], permissible file types to be uploaded, virus scanning policy), dictate what happens before a user logs in or registers (Design settings, registration methods) and where they are directed once they login.</p>

 What I Need & What You Get

I've already been working on the project for 3 months, so a lot of progress has been made. Other than slight tweaks here-and-there, the web interface/backend is complete. I've built a quick prototype for Android™ to test the content creation and retrieval mechanisms so I know I can deliver Sinookas in a realistic time frame.
I've paid for hosting, domains, and TLS/SSL certificates, so the $5,041 goal will cover the cost of the bare minimum viable product, primarily going towards development time and covering the following:

Shipping the Sinookas platform, both the web and Android applications
Increasing test coverage to 90-95% (currently at 67% for the web application and ~40% for the mobile application)
Writing setup and usage instructions
Creating video tutorials
Finishing the developer documentation
Seeking legal counsel

Because so much more can be done to improve Sinookas, the perks are arranged in a modular way giving you influence over the direction the platform will take once the first stage is complete. Think of them as a voting system. 
These are what I am putting the highest priority on, in no particular order:

Creating a Windows Phone app
Creating an iOS app
Building an ""installer""

Lower-priority features I would like to implement eventually:

Subscription/payment hooks so you have the option to earn money with a service you create
Sign in to multiple services from multiple hosts simultaneously
Integrate content with a publicly facing web view

Each of these features and goals have a corresponding $1 perk that behaves simply as a vote and a more expensive perk that unconditionally determines the next phases Sinookas will take. The upper-tier perks will be honored in a first-come basis and will trump the voting system. However I believe strongly in listening to users' requests and will otherwise prioritize further development according to the voting results. (One exception is the iOS app which will only be honored if the cost of an OSx computer is covered).
Other things I'm considering doing if enough interest is expressed:

Creating a Wordpress plugin
Porting the backend to Ruby on Rails

Should the project not reach its goal, I will still finish the project because this is something I want to use, but I can't guarantee when it will be launched. And of course I will keep any backers updated on progress being made.

 The Impact (Serious version)

Sinookas is important for those who are concerned about privacy and wish to minimize their digital footprint without sacrificing the advantages technology brings. At such an early stage in the globalized, interconnected era, it's difficult, if not impossible, to predict what effect such open and easy access to our personal data will have. There's often a trade-off between protecting ourselves and our data and taking advantage of the tools and services that pop up so quickly in this age. 
On one hand, keeping up with the terms and service (TOS) of one application as it changes is difficult enough. Keeping up with the terms and services of all your applications (Web, mobile, desktop, wearable, vehicular, etc) with all their affiliated legal documents approaches on the impossible.
On the other hand and regardless of TOS, sites get hacked. People get doxxed. Information is leaked. These things aren't necessarily malicious, but accidents happen.
Sinookas makes it so you don't have to choose between privacy/security and technology. The only person you have to trust to keep your information and your family's information safe is yourself--well, and maybe your web host depending on how you set things up.
Back to the top


 The Impact (Not-so-serious version)

While it's great for all the security-minded reasons above, it's not all doom-and-gloom! In fact Sinookas originated as the engine of a kid's book I'm writing.
Aside from plenty of single-user tasks, it's also intended for multiple users: think private services for you and your friends or colleagues what you might not want the rest of the world to see ;-) 
Be creative. There's lots of ways you can make Sinookas stupid and/or fun :)

 Risks & Challenges

Because of the nature of Sinookas, there is nothing really groundbreaking about its functionality, so the technological hurdles are minimal. It's not a matter of whether these things are possible, it's a matter of when they will be finished. And as I mentioned above, I've already finished the backend and started on the mobile app. So conservatively, I'm confident I can release Sinookas by May. In a worse case scenario with unforeseen difficulties, I would release a beta version to the backers at that time.
I've never developed for Windows Phone or iOS. To be honest I've never even programmed in C# or Objective-C--the languages required by those platforms, respectively. So there will be a bit of overhead as I port Sinookas to those operating systems. For those of you with no programming experience, that's not nearly as problematic as it sounds. It's common to have to switch to new languages for different projects. (As a comparison, the first time I ever tried developing for Android, I was able to turn my phone into audio controls for my PC in about 6 hours including download, installation, and reading documentation).
For the developers interested in extending the platform, I got the idea at a late stage to use HTTP Options to transmit meta-information about how fields should be rendered on the frontend. It's very basic at the moment, mostly just data type and whether a field is required or not when creating or updating. A more useful implementation will require a fairly significant refactoring which I don't plan to do for the first release.

 Other Ways You Can Help

It's contrived, but spread the word! It really does help. Don't be afraid to share the campaign page.
Invite me to do an AMA, casual or official. That'd be fun. I like answering questions and elaborating about what isn't clear.

 How it works

(Videos demonstrations will be uploaded soon.)

 Overview

In the most simple case, a user follows a three-step setup wizard, optionally skipping the second step, and selects from a list of 10 preset configurations to setup a working app with minimal effort in a matter of minutes.
More involved users can use the default services as templates, tweak the behavior, mix and match parts as they desire, or even skip the wizard all together and try building a service by hand from the ground up.
Developers will have the opportunity to extend the platform even further by taking advantage of hooks to create their own data models and queries then registering them with the API. The administration panel will detect them automatically and include further configuration, display, and settings options.
The truly adventurous won't even need to use the backend at all. The documentation will specify everything you need in case you want to start from scratch and communicate directly with the mobile app.


 Content Types

Sinookas is a content-driven application, so most of its power and flexibility comes from fine-tuning the behavior of content. There are currently three categories:

Content: this is the core piece of, well, content. Often it is the center-point of a service
                Examples: messages, ingredients, historical sites
Content Groups: these are exactly what they sound like: groups of content.
                Examples: conversations, recipes, tour guides
Meta-Content: content about/connected to other content or content groups.
                Examples: Away messages, tips, warnings

These categories are essentially text, geospatial information, and a file attachment with some additional information for each. You also find other attributes commonly found with digital data like the author, time-date information (publish, expiration, and deletion dates), who can view the content, who has viewed it, view counts, visibility rules, and some others.
You tailor the behavior by creating specific instances of each category, called Content Types, where you define default values and control what users can see and edit. It's a ridiculously simple idea, but a lot of ""different"" services and tasks can be squeezed out by changing minor things.
For example, take a shopping list, just a group of food items. It's a very basic Content Group. By allowing other people to contribute, the shopping list becomes dynamic so your family or roommates can add to it from wherever they are. But any list that accepts input from multiple users is functionally no different than a private messenger service. Because we're consenting adults, all it takes is to just rename   ""shopping list"" and ""food item"" to ""conversation"" and ""message"" to create the illusion of a different service. There are more subtle changes you can make to improve the user experience, but this is just a demonstration.
Then by enabling GPS-data for each of these, your shopping list alerts you to pick something up as you walk by a store and a location-dependent messenger where you continue conversations based on where you are.
Alternatively, requiring users to provide publish and expiration dates shifts the behavior from geospatial notifications to temporal ones, or in other words, a reminder system, the basis for daily planners, todo lists, project management, calendars. etc. etc.
Little tweaks open up lots of possibilities. Be creative. Ask yourself questions. What effect does adding users to a service have? What could a a maximum view count be used for? Does changing the order of content matter? What happens when all messages have the same value for X? What do you get when you limit titles to 140 characters? What happens when all content has a required duration after which it is no longer available? Why would I want all active users to be visible on the map?


 Services

Once the content types are set up, you build your service. These are more general rules that tie everything together. You can require all activity to take place in certain geographic reasons, and if so, whether the map should be viewable. You set how often users can search and how fast users can travel--intended to protect against cheating and bots but maybe there are other uses?
Under certain circumstances users are considered to be a special type of content, so here you can define what should be visible and editable.
It's also where you include and exclude the content types you've created. You determine whether users can create content or just read it. For geospatial content, you define how far away a user must be to detect content.
You also have the opportunity to change the color scheme and some labels here.


 Global Settings

Each Sinookas server can run multiple services simultaneously. Global settings are rules that apply to all of your services (e.g., the name of your server, a description, terms of service[if applicable], permissible file types to be uploaded, virus scanning policy), dictate what happens before a user logs in or registers (Design settings, registration methods) and where they are directed once they login.

 Ideas

These are just some multi-user services I would like people to create:

Local history guides/tours for cities, towns, and regions
Neighborhood watches
GPS guide to fiction that takes place in real locations (e.g., On the Road, and Confederacy of Dunces), with chapters mapped to where they may have taken place
Location-based news
Boycotts
Archaeology excavation aides
GEO-blogging
Human Trackers/Visual aids for sports that take place over large areas: paintball, cross country, mountain biking.

<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<div style=""text-align: justify;"">
<p><strong>How does SENSE communicate?<br/></strong></p>
<p>SENSE is controlled via a mobile APP that uses SMS commands for exchanging information between SENSE and your mobile phone. SENSE does not require the Internet connection and can be accessed in limited areas such as mountains, lakes or other rural areas. Thanks to this you will also save money on data services, especially when you are abroad.<br/></p>
<p><strong> Why do I need GPS/GLONASS localization?</strong></p>
<p>Thanks to GPS and GLONASS high quality antenna and chip, you will know exactly where your object (caravan, yacht,..) is located. You can use Guard functionality to receive notification whenever your object changes its position real time! Or even more, you can use it to easily navigate to your object's current location!<br/></p>
<p><strong>What happens if caravan/boat battery voltage drops?</strong><br/></p>
<p>SENSE is constantly monitoring input voltage and therefore you can set Voltage level alert to get a notification whenever your system is running on low power! SENSE has 4xAA batteries (not included in package), so even in case your power supply is completely off, you can still get notified!<br/></p>

<div style=""text-align: justify;"">
<p><strong>How accurate SENSE measures temperature?</strong><br/></p>
<p>SENSE is using precise digital temperature sensors in a small waterproof case for temperature measurement. SENSE is designed to measure two temperatures and gives you the option to set required hysteresis.<br/></p>
<p><strong>How SENSE temperature control works?</strong><br/></p>
<p>Based on first temperature sensor input, SENSE operates heating and cooling outputs to achieve desired temperature, while taking into account hysteresis. Second temperature sensor input is used for ambient temperature measurement and for antifreeze notification.<br/></p>
<p><strong>What kinds of temperature control modes are possible with SENSE?</strong><br/></p>
<p>SENSE can operate heating and cooling in automatic mode, timer mode or manual control mode. In automatic mode, you can enjoy temperature as you set it up. Timer mode gives you option to specify when heating or cooling should be active. Manual mode gives you complete control over heater and cooler control.<br/></p>
<p><strong>How can I use AUX?</strong><br/></p>
<p>SENSE is capable of operating 2 individual power outputs, each with manual or timer mode. This gives you the ability to operate boiler, lights, garden fountain, fan or anything else that you would like to turn on and off remotely or by the timer. Please keep in mind the technical limits of the outputs.<br/></p>
<p><strong>Alarm functionality, what does it mean for SENSE?</strong><br/></p>
<p>Do you like to get notification to your phone when something is happening? SENSE has potential free contact port where you can connect sensors such as door or window magnetic contact, warning output of some electronics and so on.<br/></p>
<p><strong>Does SENSE have antifreeze function?</strong><br/></p>
<p>Yes, you can setup alarm threshold and when temperature drops below, you will get notification to your phone!<br/></p>

<p></p>
</div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;"">
<p><strong>Is it possible to install SENSE to existing systems?</strong><br/></p>
<p>For sure! It is possible to connect SENSE to nearly all systems and installations. With installation manual which is part of the package, you will find easy to read connection schema that will guide you through. If you have some doubts, please let us know via contact form.<br/></p>
<p><strong>What kind of power supply is needed?</strong><br/></p>
<p>SENSE is working with 12V power input. You can use direct connection from your caravan/boat electrical system or use power adapter that suits your country specification and provide 12VDC@1A power.<br/></p>
<p><strong>What is included in the package?</strong><br/></p>
<p>In a package, you can find SENSE, 2x temperature sensors, GPS/GLONASS &amp; GSM combined external antenna, installation and user manual.<br/></p>
<p><strong>Why isn't the adapter a standard part of the package?</strong><br/></p>
<p>ISA watches every aspect of environmental protection within its products / packages. Before you add this accessory, please check at home, perhaps you might have an unused adapter for SENSE available :-). Thank you.<br/></p>
<p><strong>Where can I find the mobile application?&amp;</strong><br/></p>
<p>Mobile application for iOS and Android systems, which will be free of any charge, will be publicly available when in August 2016.<br/></p>
<p><strong>How can I install it myself?</strong><br/></p>
<p>Installation has to be performed according to installation manual. Installation can be performed by medium technically skilled person. When in doubts, please ask electrician to install it. Please always check and follow your local regulations.<br/></p>

With Sense on the job it's like having a 24 hour security and maintenance team on duty in your home, on your boat, in your RV or camper or even out on your pool or Jacuzzi deck.



If you're not amazed yet, then consider this!
ALL of this functionality is achieved WITHOUT an Internet Connection!







How is This Possible? How Can Sense Do All of This? How Does Sense Work?


This diagram shows you how Sense operates in a house and what it's capable of doing once installed.  Similar principles apply to campers, boats and even swimming pools.








Here's how you control Sense from your phone:







Sense is easy to install by anybody and easy to control from anywhere.




What We Need & What You Get



Sense is developed, tested and now we want to make it avaialable for YOU!

We need your help, so we can start with production, which is the driving force behind this crowdfunding campaign.

When we hit our $75,000 funding goal we'll thank our backers with very generous pricing on Sense of up to 30% off regular price.

If we fall short of our funding goal we will apply all of the funds raised to promotion and marketing of Sense to everybody around the world as much as is possible.











Frequently Asked Questions



How does SENSE communicate?
SENSE is controlled via a mobile APP that uses SMS commands for exchanging information between SENSE and your mobile phone. SENSE does not require the Internet connection and can be accessed in limited areas such as mountains, lakes or other rural areas. Thanks to this you will also save money on data services, especially when you are abroad.
 Why do I need GPS/GLONASS localization?
Thanks to GPS and GLONASS high quality antenna and chip, you will know exactly where your object (caravan, yacht,..) is located. You can use Guard functionality to receive notification whenever your object changes its position real time! Or even more, you can use it to easily navigate to your object's current location!
What happens if caravan/boat battery voltage drops?
SENSE is constantly monitoring input voltage and therefore you can set Voltage level alert to get a notification whenever your system is running on low power! SENSE has 4xAA batteries (not included in package), so even in case your power supply is completely off, you can still get notified!








How accurate SENSE measures temperature?
SENSE is using precise digital temperature sensors in a small waterproof case for temperature measurement. SENSE is designed to measure two temperatures and gives you the option to set required hysteresis.
How SENSE temperature control works?
Based on first temperature sensor input, SENSE operates heating and cooling outputs to achieve desired temperature, while taking into account hysteresis. Second temperature sensor input is used for ambient temperature measurement and for antifreeze notification.
What kinds of temperature control modes are possible with SENSE?
SENSE can operate heating and cooling in automatic mode, timer mode or manual control mode. In automatic mode, you can enjoy temperature as you set it up. Timer mode gives you option to specify when heating or cooling should be active. Manual mode gives you complete control over heater and cooler control.
How can I use AUX?
SENSE is capable of operating 2 individual power outputs, each with manual or timer mode. This gives you the ability to operate boiler, lights, garden fountain, fan or anything else that you would like to turn on and off remotely or by the timer. Please keep in mind the technical limits of the outputs.
Alarm functionality, what does it mean for SENSE?
Do you like to get notification to your phone when something is happening? SENSE has potential free contact port where you can connect sensors such as door or window magnetic contact, warning output of some electronics and so on.
Does SENSE have antifreeze function?
Yes, you can setup alarm threshold and when temperature drops below, you will get notification to your phone!







Is it possible to install SENSE to existing systems?
For sure! It is possible to connect SENSE to nearly all systems and installations. With installation manual which is part of the package, you will find easy to read connection schema that will guide you through. If you have some doubts, please let us know via contact form.
What kind of power supply is needed?
SENSE is working with 12V power input. You can use direct connection from your caravan/boat electrical system or use power adapter that suits your country specification and provide 12VDC@1A power.
What is included in the package?
In a package, you can find SENSE, 2x temperature sensors, GPS/GLONASS & GSM combined external antenna, installation and user manual.
Why isn't the adapter a standard part of the package?
ISA watches every aspect of environmental protection within its products / packages. Before you add this accessory, please check at home, perhaps you might have an unused adapter for SENSE available :-). Thank you.
Where can I find the mobile application?&
Mobile application for iOS and Android systems, which will be free of any charge, will be publicly available when in August 2016.
How can I install it myself?
Installation has to be performed according to installation manual. Installation can be performed by medium technically skilled person. When in doubts, please ask electrician to install it. Please always check and follow your local regulations.









Risks & Challenges
There are no risks or challenges. Sense is a reality and has been tested in homes, boats and campers across Europe.

<p>We thought of Shake A Date 14 months ago as we wanted to create a fun way for singles to meet and interact, and come away from the old fahsioned way of long, boring compatibility questionairres and leave love in the hands of fate! We set about raising funds to pay a development company to build the first version of the app for us, and launched 5 months later in March 2012. Since then we have built up a customer base of over 12,000 members purely through free social media marketing. We need to build the next version of the app plus a fully functioning web version that will have a 'premium account' option for our members to upgrade. This next build is vital to keeping our dream alive as we need a revenue stream to keep the project going. We have literally put everything into this so far and would love to have the opportunity to take it to the next level!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>HOW IT CURRENTLY WORKS</strong>...</p>
<p>Search for the person you want to find by choosing their Gender, Age Range and either Current Country and Current City or, GPS which will find the people closest to you within a chosen mile radius.</p>
<div id=""columns"">
<div>
<p>Once you've entered their criteria start the fun by shaking your iPhone (iPod or iPad) you'll then randomly find someone matching the criteria you entered. If you’re not feeling them simply keep shaking until you find someone you like.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>When you find someone you like you can start chatting to them, or if you’re feeling shy and want them to 'make the move' then send them a 'Like' and let nature shake its course.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>HOW WILL THE MONEY BE SPENT (NEW DEVELOPMENT)</strong></p>
<p>The £17,000 we need to raise will cover the developemnt costs for a version 2 of the Shake A Date app and for the build of a fully functioning website that will work on the same basis as the app.</p>
<p>Version 2 of the app will be developed with a premium account built in, which will include Video &amp; Voice chat through the users iPhone system. This development will cost £9,000</p>
<p>A whole new website will be built with the with the same features as the app but will have slightly different functionality to suit web. This development will cost £11,000</p>

Once you've entered their criteria start the fun by shaking your iPhone (iPod or iPad) you'll then randomly find someone matching the criteria you entered. If you’re not feeling them simply keep shaking until you find someone you like.

We spent a lot of time building something that is truly revolutionary. Klikr has inside in it, highly sophisticated and compact robotic technology, that needs expensive tooling for manufacturing. We want to be transparent on how we spend the funds from our supporters. Below is a projection of how the funds will be spent. </div>

<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>With a product that is highly sophisticated with very intricate tiny parts, the main challenge is quality control. Thus, we have gone through great lengths to choose our manufacturing and supply partners very carefully, to ensure they are well equipped to handle a project of this magnitude. Another challenge is the size of our order. With a larger order, the cost will reduce due to economies of sale, however, the manufacturing lead time might increase. That is a balance we will have to monitor very closely to avoid delays in the shipping schedule. In all circumstances we will keep our backers posted and in the loop, as we understand the importance of communication. More importantly, we really want to share this entire experience with our backers</p>

</div></div>","Klikr is unlike any other consumer product in the market. It symbolizes style and class. We believe it  will change the way people capture, store and share their memories. Thanks to our growing number of backers from Canada, USA, Hong Kong, Mexico, Israel, United Kingdom, Greece, India, Singapore, Australia and Vietnam for generously supporting Klikr. Join Us !!!!!in bringing klikr to the market.Introducing KlikrKlikr
is a cutting edge modular case, for iPhone 6, iPhone 6s and Samsung S6. It has
a built-in 16 megapixel robotic camera that is fully detachable. Klikr
comes equipped with a smart selfie stick, a 2400mAh battery for extra juice and
a super cool Magnetic charging system.Klikr has a ground breaking user interface with an elegant design. Klikr was crafted with only one thing in mind, to reinvent the camera and revolutionize the entire photo taking experience. Klikr boasts extremely advanced micro-robotic technology with sophisticated circuitry that creates a seamless photo taking experience.
A built-in selfie stick provides up to 2 feet of extension for perfect group or individual selfies.  The klikr camera, is the smallest action camera available in the market. When detached and laid horizontally, the selfie stick acts as a stable motorized base for the camera, making it the most advanced robotic camera system, that can be wirelessly controlled from a distance of more than 10 feet.






The wand and the camera has its own battery that makes it a fully functional action camera. The camera connects with every smartphone via WiFi and Bluetooth.


""Klikr Karry""  makes Klikr camera the smallest action camera for capturing those memorable and adventurous moments and works with every go-pro and other existing mount bases.



Klikr has a built-in 2400 mAh battery, that doubles your phones battery life. 






Klikr also comes in just the battery pack, for those who like to keep the Wand and Camera separate from the case. The klikr battery pack case has a 2400 mAh battery that gives an additional 24 hours of standby time.


Another thing that makes klikr a really futuristic gadget is its magnetic charging system, that charges the whole system simultaneously.


Klikr is fully modular. You can have the wand and the camera separate, the klikr battery pack case (without the wand and camera) or the full klikr experience. 




Klikr is built upon a groundbreaking media and photo sharing app. We are introducing for the first time ever, a Zero-Click share mechanism that sets new standards in user experience. Kapchaa lets you capture, share and organize your memories all from the same app.





Kapchaa has a built-in lock feature that lets you simply drag and drop your photo in a password secured folder for absolute privacy.








We spent a lot of time building something that is truly revolutionary. Klikr has inside in it, highly sophisticated and compact robotic technology, that needs expensive tooling for manufacturing. We want to be transparent on how we spend the funds from our supporters. Below is a projection of how the funds will be spent. 






OUR TEAM:
We are a small but talented team with years of technology experience in our bags. 
The Genius (Saad A)- When he’s not busy at the office, he can be found at a golf course working on his game. 
The Troublemaker (Ray S)- Outside of work, Ray’s interest vary from video games to reading comics, and sometimes traveling. 
Marketing Ninja (Anmol K)- Aside from marketing, Anmol loves cooking and claims to cook a mean lasagna. 
The Comic (Jazz S)- In his free time, Jazz loves playing guitar. You can also find him watching Jackie-chan’s movies.  
The Design Guru (Addy Z)- Apart from designing, Addy can be found with his telescope, looking at the sky, while enjoying a glass of wine with a cigar. 

Klikr is a groundbreaking idea, and we believe it will revolutionize the way people capture moments. But we’re a young start up and we need your support. All it takes right now is a pledge on Indiegogo.

<p>
<b>1. What does it mean that some place is marked with an actual color?</b><br/>
Colors match sense of safety marked by people. From clear green (the safest) to clear red (the most dangerous).
</p>
<p>
<b>2. On what basis should I mark places?</b><br/>
Every time you are/were at (or simply know about) a place which for you seems dangerous you a have chance to spread this info all over the word. Same thing with safe places.
</p>
<p>
<b>3. Can I mark area with different color than it is marked at the moment?</b><br/>
Yes, in fact this is what SafeThre is all about, anyone can have own opinion.
</p>
<p>
<b>4. I don't have Android device. Can I use SafeThru?</b><br/>
At this moment no, but if campaign will be realized in 200% iOS version will be developed.
</p>
<p>
<b>5. If I want to check or mark some place do I have to register an account?</b><br/>
Yes, the account registration is required.
</p>
<p><b>6. Where can I find instruction for this app?</b><br/>
You can get the instruction at <a href=""http://www.safethru.com/tutorial.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.safethru.com/tutorial.pdf</a>
</p>
<p>
<b>7. Is SafeThru powered by some data from police reports or any other sources?</b><br/>
SafeThru does not use data from police or any other publicly available sources. SafeThru represents sense of safety in regard to individual users' opinions.

After that, we are planing to adapt the application to smart watches.




FAQ:

1. What does it mean that some place is marked with an actual color?
Colors match sense of safety marked by people. From clear green (the safest) to clear red (the most dangerous).


2. On what basis should I mark places?
Every time you are/were at (or simply know about) a place which for you seems dangerous you a have chance to spread this info all over the word. Same thing with safe places.


3. Can I mark area with different color than it is marked at the moment?
Yes, in fact this is what SafeThre is all about, anyone can have own opinion.


4. I don't have Android device. Can I use SafeThru?
At this moment no, but if campaign will be realized in 200% iOS version will be developed.


5. If I want to check or mark some place do I have to register an account?
Yes, the account registration is required.

6. Where can I find instruction for this app?
You can get the instruction at www.safethru.com/tutorial.pdf


7. Is SafeThru powered by some data from police reports or any other sources?
SafeThru does not use data from police or any other publicly available sources. SafeThru represents sense of safety in regard to individual users' opinions.

<p><b>Key Features of ODIN2</b></p>
<p><b>Touch Screen </b></p>
<p>Big upgrade to ODIN2 - a beautiful 5 inch touchscreen.</p>
<p>In order to simplify the user interface experience and take full advantage of all the features of the Android OS, we’ve integrated the touch screen. Since it’s the same touchscreen you’ll find on your smartphone, you can get familiarized with ODIN in no time.</p>
<div data-id=""14248847""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/v1479849360/zljjded9denpxlvoybjj.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></figure></div>
<p> <b>Android OS</b></p>
<p>ODIN2 has an Android 6.0 OS installed inside, so you can access all your favorite entertainment and productivity apps such as Netflix, HBO Now, Skype, Youtube, Office 365, Pandora, Spotify, Chrome, and a million other apps. ODIN2 was designed as a standalone device so you can do most things that your smartphone can do - without your smartphone or computer. </p>
<p>Android 6.0 OS will be running a Quad-core ARM Cortex-A17, 1.8GHz chip with 2GB DDR RAM.</p>
<div data-id=""14144193""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img alt=""ODIN Prototype Home Screenshot"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/v1479849361/irhcfysjtpzatwhskw6x.png"" src="""" style=""""/><figcaption>ODIN Prototype Home Screenshot</figcaption></figure></div>
<p><b>Optical Projector</b></p>
<p>ODIN2's innovative LED light source generates 300 lumens of brightness with native HD resolution of 1280p x 720 and maximum resolution of 1080p; but is still efficient enough to connect to an external battery pack* and give you the portability to take it anywhere an electric socket is not readily available.  Moreover, ODIN’s LED light source will last over 30,000 hours or approximately 3.5 years of continuous play. </p>
<p>From 1 yard away, ODIN’s optical beam can produce a 37” screen size, and a 110” screen size from 3 yards - allowing you to bypass the difficult setup and exorbitant cost of traditional home theatre systems.</p>
<div data-id=""14341235""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img alt=""ODIN2 Optical Lens + Auto Focus Camera"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/v1479849361/fuaxksg8nkgkjr0wlkvt.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><figcaption>ODIN2 Optical Lens + Auto Focus Camera</figcaption></figure></div>

<p>* Requires 12V @ 3A or 19V @ 2A output external battery pack</p>
<p><b>Screen Sharing</b></p>
<p>While ODIN is a standalone device, you can also beam your phone screen to ODIN. This allows you to project content from all your iOS devices like iPhone and iPad, Android devices, and Windows computer.</p>
<p><b>Keystone Picture </b></p>
<p>Keystone will be especially useful when ODIN2 is tilted at an angle. Due to physics, if a projector beam hits the surface at an angle, it will distort the image into a trapezoid shape. Having keystone function will readjust the picture to a rectangle. </p>
<div data-id=""14144258""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img alt=""Keystone Correction"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/v1479849363/djifmqd13plhmuutangt.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><figcaption>Keystone Correction</figcaption></figure></div>
<p><b>Auto Focus</b></p>
<p>We added an extra camera in front of ODIN2 to automate the picture focus without a manual mechanism.</p>
<p><b>Wide Angle Camera </b></p>
<p>ODIN2 comes with an embedded wide-angle camera to allow for video calls using video apps like Skype and Google Hangouts. Unlike a smartphone, ODIN allows multiple people to gather around and be seen in a video call with your friends, family, or business . </p>
<p><b>Microphone </b></p>
<p>ODIN2 is equipped with microphones to pick up external sound, significantly increasing the number of voice apps compatible with the device. Microphones will enhance your experience when video calling through Skype, or using digital assistants like Google Now. </p>
<p><b>Speaker</b></p>
<p>We are using a 23.8 mm diameter speaker with custom designed sound cavity to provide quality bass and sound.</p>
<p><b>Kickstand </b></p>
<p>The ODIN series is the only smart projector line with a built-in kickstand to adjust the screen angle 90 degrees, so you can project all your content any way you like (we recommend tilting at 90º for a great ceiling projection!)</p>

<p><b>Tripod </b></p>
<p>We received a lot of requests from our ODIN1 backers to be able to mount ODIN on a tripod, so we included this feature in our second version.</p>

<h1>Connectivity </h1>
<p><b>WiFi + Bluetooth</b></p>
<p>ODIN2 features a dual band 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz WiFi chip (802.11 b/g/n) to give you a more stable wireless connection for video streaming. You can also pair your bluetooth speakers, keyboard, mouse, presentation clicker, etc. via ODINs’s integrated Bluetooth 4.0 standard.</p>
<p><b>Memory</b> </p>
<p>ODIN2 comes with an internal 16GB memory space for you to save files, pictures and movies and access them directly from ODIN without connecting to the internet.  You can also connect your Dropbox or Google Drive storage apps onto ODIN to access all your entertainment and business files.</p>
<div>
<p><b>MicroSD | USB | HDMI | Headphone</b></p>
<div data-id=""14086120""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/v1479849367/ri81kr3wagoofuauetzz.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></figure></div>
<p>We wanted to make it as easy as possible to showcase your GoPro videos by including a microSD card slot directly into ODIN. Now, it’s easy to share your experiences on the big screen with friends and family after a day of skiing, climbing, kayaking and more. </p>
<p>ODIN2 comes with two USB 2.0 ports - you can attach your flash drive to access your files and attach accessories like your wired mouse and keyboard.  </p>
<p>You can also easily project and play video games on the big screen by connecting Xbox, Playstation, Nintendo and computers directly to ODIN’s HDCP compatible HDMI port.  ODIN2 also comes with a regular 3.5 mm TRRS headphone port.</p>
<h1><b>Designing a digital world. </b></h1>
</div>
<div>
<p>Completely redesigned, we’ve made ODIN2 more beautiful, easy to use and intuitive.  Five-inch touch screen makes it easier to control and interact with ODIN2's Android operating system, thus we matched the touch screen width to the device's overall size dimension.  We also tilted the screen at a slight angle to make it easier to see when in use. </p>
<p><i>""The overall shape was designed to be more slender and less obtrusive. The black top allows it to blend into the background when it is being used so it doesn't disrupt the viewing experience. The white underbelly is slightly recessed to protect and cover the front lens area."" - Ed Mitchell</i></p>

<h1>Our inspiration.</h1>
<p>""Sometimes when a problem offers no apparent answers, the only solution is to radically alter the operating parameters. </p>
<p>After being continuously frustrated with paying for cable service I wasn’t using, I decided to make the bold move to cancel my subscription. I was getting all my news and entertainment via the Internet and my mobile phone – watching cable shows on my television was something I rarely did. </p>
<p>I decided to venture out and find a device that would meet my needs. I wanted a product that could handle all my viewing apps (Youtube, Netflix, Hulu, etc.) as well as something that would be as easy and intuitive to use as my smartphone. To my dismay, the only way I could achieve what I desired was hooking up my computer to a bulky projector (prone to inconvenient overheating) and separate, external speakers. </p>
<p>Long story short, that search morphed into the initial idea for the creation of the Dos Owls ODIN – a multi-functional, portable visual display that solves a slew of A/V problems and opens the door to a limitless universe of content sharing possibilities. </p>
<p>Necessity sparked invention and I haven’t looked back since.""</p>
<p>- Alex Yoo, Founder</p>
<h1>Why IndieGoGo? </h1>
<p>It’s thanks to the amazing backers from our successful campaign for ODIN1 back in 2014 that we were able to fund, expand, and bring this creative dream to life. Over 561 backers from over 37 countries supported ODIN1. We were amazed by the level of engagement and spirit of the global crowdfunding community. ODIN2 has been completely redesigned and re-engineered mostly based on feedback from our ODIN1 backers.</p>

<h1>Dos Owls Team</h1>
<p><b>ALEX YOO BIO - FOUNDER</b></p>
<p>Originally from the suburbs of Chicago and currently residing in Ditmas Park, Brooklyn, Alex Yoo earned his first professional experience in the fast-paced financial world of Wall Street. For five years, he plied his trade diligently at Houlihan Lokey, Nomura Securities and Tri Artisan Partners.</p>
<p>However, he soon grew restless with the repetitive PowerPoint presentations and Excel sheets, so he decided to make a change. His next venture came about as a matter of necessity. A habitual sharp dresser, he’d always had difficulty finding dress shirts that worked for his body frame. He took a bold risk and launched an online custom shirt company called Alexander West. He poured all his energy and resources into the business, and Alexander West is presently an established player in the NYC custom clothing market.</p>
<p>Alex’s newest project is a tech venture called Dos Owls. The idea stemmed from a desire to enjoy his Netflix /Hulu content on a more compact, multifunctional device. The first Dos Owls product is called ODIN, which has several distinct features including an Android processor, portable theater-like viewing, wireless connectivity, exceptional sound output and innovative design.</p>

ODIN2 combines the big picture experience of a projector with the smart and convenient functions of an Android tablet.  It’s the ideal product for people who consume most of their entertainment using Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime, the web and mobile applications.  

 
 

 With ODIN2, you can: 

Stream movies from HBO Now, Netflix or Hulu. 
Make video calls using Skype or Google Hangouts.
Mirror your iPhone and Android phone screens to ODIN.
Access files from Dropbox or Skydrive. 
Surf the web on Chrome or Firefox. 
Use Google Docs and Office 365.
Play Xbox or Playstation on a big screen. 
Stream music on Spotify, Pandora, and more.
Download movies and files onto the internal hard drive.
And enjoy just about as many more functions as there are apps in the Android store!

Utilize video calling apps like Skype to talk to family and friends
 
ODIN's simple easy setup allows movie nights on the roof, patio or anywhere
  
Watch movies on the ceiling or any surface
 
 ODIN1 in Action

 
A completely updated device.
ODIN2 is a two generation upgrade from ODIN1 in terms of hardware, software and user experience. We reviewed all the feedback we received from ODIN1 users in real life scenarios, and incorporated their suggestions into creating a completely redesigned and reengineered ODIN2 from the ground up. 
Keeping the same functions you know and love from ODIN1, we’ve made a more functional, beautiful, and powerful ODIN2. 

ODIN1 vs. ODIN2 
NEW features at a glance:

Camera and microphone to allow video and voice calls 
Full color touch screen for easy control and interaction
Keystone picture adjustment
Auto Focus
Micro SD slot
HDMI w/ HDCP compatibility
Smart Quiet Fan System
Tripod Mount
Mobile apps for screen sharing with iPhones and Android phones
Screen orientation control – Reverse, Side Flips, Rotations
Sleep mode for energy efficiency Open root access


Key Features of ODIN2
Touch Screen 
Big upgrade to ODIN2 - a beautiful 5 inch touchscreen.
In order to simplify the user interface experience and take full advantage of all the features of the Android OS, we’ve integrated the touch screen. Since it’s the same touchscreen you’ll find on your smartphone, you can get familiarized with ODIN in no time.

 Android OS
ODIN2 has an Android 6.0 OS installed inside, so you can access all your favorite entertainment and productivity apps such as Netflix, HBO Now, Skype, Youtube, Office 365, Pandora, Spotify, Chrome, and a million other apps. ODIN2 was designed as a standalone device so you can do most things that your smartphone can do - without your smartphone or computer. 
Android 6.0 OS will be running a Quad-core ARM Cortex-A17, 1.8GHz chip with 2GB DDR RAM.

Optical Projector
ODIN2's innovative LED light source generates 300 lumens of brightness with native HD resolution of 1280p x 720 and maximum resolution of 1080p; but is still efficient enough to connect to an external battery pack* and give you the portability to take it anywhere an electric socket is not readily available.  Moreover, ODIN’s LED light source will last over 30,000 hours or approximately 3.5 years of continuous play. 
From 1 yard away, ODIN’s optical beam can produce a 37” screen size, and a 110” screen size from 3 yards - allowing you to bypass the difficult setup and exorbitant cost of traditional home theatre systems.
ODIN2 Optical Lens + Auto Focus Camera
 
ODIN2 Connected to Battery Pack
* Requires 12V @ 3A or 19V @ 2A output external battery pack
Screen Sharing
While ODIN is a standalone device, you can also beam your phone screen to ODIN. This allows you to project content from all your iOS devices like iPhone and iPad, Android devices, and Windows computer.
Keystone Picture 
Keystone will be especially useful when ODIN2 is tilted at an angle. Due to physics, if a projector beam hits the surface at an angle, it will distort the image into a trapezoid shape. Having keystone function will readjust the picture to a rectangle. 
Keystone Correction
Auto Focus
We added an extra camera in front of ODIN2 to automate the picture focus without a manual mechanism.
Wide Angle Camera 
ODIN2 comes with an embedded wide-angle camera to allow for video calls using video apps like Skype and Google Hangouts. Unlike a smartphone, ODIN allows multiple people to gather around and be seen in a video call with your friends, family, or business . 
Microphone 
ODIN2 is equipped with microphones to pick up external sound, significantly increasing the number of voice apps compatible with the device. Microphones will enhance your experience when video calling through Skype, or using digital assistants like Google Now. 
Speaker
We are using a 23.8 mm diameter speaker with custom designed sound cavity to provide quality bass and sound.
Kickstand 
The ODIN series is the only smart projector line with a built-in kickstand to adjust the screen angle 90 degrees, so you can project all your content any way you like (we recommend tilting at 90º for a great ceiling projection!)

Tripod 
We received a lot of requests from our ODIN1 backers to be able to mount ODIN on a tripod, so we included this feature in our second version.

Internal Parts

Connectivity 
WiFi + Bluetooth
ODIN2 features a dual band 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz WiFi chip (802.11 b/g/n) to give you a more stable wireless connection for video streaming. You can also pair your bluetooth speakers, keyboard, mouse, presentation clicker, etc. via ODINs’s integrated Bluetooth 4.0 standard.
Memory 
ODIN2 comes with an internal 16GB memory space for you to save files, pictures and movies and access them directly from ODIN without connecting to the internet.  You can also connect your Dropbox or Google Drive storage apps onto ODIN to access all your entertainment and business files.

MicroSD | USB | HDMI | Headphone

We wanted to make it as easy as possible to showcase your GoPro videos by including a microSD card slot directly into ODIN. Now, it’s easy to share your experiences on the big screen with friends and family after a day of skiing, climbing, kayaking and more. 
ODIN2 comes with two USB 2.0 ports - you can attach your flash drive to access your files and attach accessories like your wired mouse and keyboard.  
You can also easily project and play video games on the big screen by connecting Xbox, Playstation, Nintendo and computers directly to ODIN’s HDCP compatible HDMI port.  ODIN2 also comes with a regular 3.5 mm TRRS headphone port.
Designing a digital world. 


Completely redesigned, we’ve made ODIN2 more beautiful, easy to use and intuitive.  Five-inch touch screen makes it easier to control and interact with ODIN2's Android operating system, thus we matched the touch screen width to the device's overall size dimension.  We also tilted the screen at a slight angle to make it easier to see when in use. 
""The overall shape was designed to be more slender and less obtrusive. The black top allows it to blend into the background when it is being used so it doesn't disrupt the viewing experience. The white underbelly is slightly recessed to protect and cover the front lens area."" - Ed Mitchell

Our inspiration.
""Sometimes when a problem offers no apparent answers, the only solution is to radically alter the operating parameters. 
After being continuously frustrated with paying for cable service I wasn’t using, I decided to make the bold move to cancel my subscription. I was getting all my news and entertainment via the Internet and my mobile phone – watching cable shows on my television was something I rarely did. 
I decided to venture out and find a device that would meet my needs. I wanted a product that could handle all my viewing apps (Youtube, Netflix, Hulu, etc.) as well as something that would be as easy and intuitive to use as my smartphone. To my dismay, the only way I could achieve what I desired was hooking up my computer to a bulky projector (prone to inconvenient overheating) and separate, external speakers. 
Long story short, that search morphed into the initial idea for the creation of the Dos Owls ODIN – a multi-functional, portable visual display that solves a slew of A/V problems and opens the door to a limitless universe of content sharing possibilities. 
Necessity sparked invention and I haven’t looked back since.""
- Alex Yoo, Founder
Why IndieGoGo? 
It’s thanks to the amazing backers from our successful campaign for ODIN1 back in 2014 that we were able to fund, expand, and bring this creative dream to life. Over 561 backers from over 37 countries supported ODIN1. We were amazed by the level of engagement and spirit of the global crowdfunding community. ODIN2 has been completely redesigned and re-engineered mostly based on feedback from our ODIN1 backers.
ODIN1 backers from around the world
 
Timeline 
After we complete our campaign in December 2016, we expect to ship ODIN2 in June 2017.

 
Dos Owls Team
ALEX YOO BIO - FOUNDER
Originally from the suburbs of Chicago and currently residing in Ditmas Park, Brooklyn, Alex Yoo earned his first professional experience in the fast-paced financial world of Wall Street. For five years, he plied his trade diligently at Houlihan Lokey, Nomura Securities and Tri Artisan Partners.
However, he soon grew restless with the repetitive PowerPoint presentations and Excel sheets, so he decided to make a change. His next venture came about as a matter of necessity. A habitual sharp dresser, he’d always had difficulty finding dress shirts that worked for his body frame. He took a bold risk and launched an online custom shirt company called Alexander West. He poured all his energy and resources into the business, and Alexander West is presently an established player in the NYC custom clothing market.
Alex’s newest project is a tech venture called Dos Owls. The idea stemmed from a desire to enjoy his Netflix /Hulu content on a more compact, multifunctional device. The first Dos Owls product is called ODIN, which has several distinct features including an Android processor, portable theater-like viewing, wireless connectivity, exceptional sound output and innovative design.

<p>There is a worldwide
unmet demand in the Fencing sport for a wireless method to
display scoring, replacing the hampering cables and reels and body cords. In 2013 the Federation Internationale
d'Escrime (FIE) issued the Wireless 2016 international Contest, for inventing, developing, &amp; proving a working system.  The winner of the contest will receive an
order for 1,000 systems.</p>
<p>SaEF Technologies has
submitted two Proposals toward this Contest. 
We are NOT basing this business venture on the presumption of winning
the Contest.</p>
<p>As our two systems will
satisfy the Fencing community's requirements, we shall request approval (""homologation"") by the FIE, and offer systems for sale
at a reasonable price.</p>
<p>A rough estimate of the
worldwide market at saturation is $170,000,000.</p><p><b>B1.  Introduction &amp; Team</b></p>
<p>Since the beginning of
Electronically Scored Fencing in the 1950's, Fencers have had to live with
electrical cords attached to and trailing behind their bodies, with spring operated
reels attempting to keep up with body movements, and living with restrictions
to formerly accepted actions such as “touch from behind back”, ""touch from
behind head"",  and more.</p>
<p>Moreover, the very
presence of electrical wires, connectors, contacts, and the like in the highly
dynamic sport of fencing always causes constant problems with equipment breakdowns, spoiling the dynamics and enjoyment of the
game.  There is no fencer on Earth that
does not loathe the incessant problems caused by the wires, cords, and connectors.</p>
<p>For twenty years a method
has been sought to create a wireless system.  To no avail. 
Indeed three companies attempted to resolve the problem, but ran afoul
of an electronic engineering hurdle that defeated them, namely the inherent absence
of a physically closable circuit between the fencers, in other words the absence of a
direct connection when using wireless.  A
bypass to the problem by arbitrarily declaring both fencers' bodies to having
the same electrical potential (ground), was found to be untrue, and causes the systems
to fail.</p>
<p>Within a very few years, a
good wireless system would sweep away the old cords-based technology.  Also open the sport to multitudes of potential fencers currently unable to afford the
expensive and cumbersome equipment that is plagued by frequent
breakdowns.</p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0.06em; line-height: 1.45em;"">Team:</span></p><p>Mr

Add Asia to the equation, for Asian Fencing (not European), and completely new markets open, as well as branches of the sport
Add the Elementary grades 3 thru 8 which
     could also be served by the SaEF improvements, and we get several thousand
     more schools and students.   BTW, Mr Shamir’s MA South Shore SaEF
     Fencing Clubs offers SabreK today for the 8-10 age group, with substantial
     success.
In other words, the adoption of SaEF
     technologies may multiply the Fencing Sport market several fold, expanding
     the business horizon by many, many $ Millions.
IMPORTANTLY:  the
     release into the marketplace of many hundreds, perhaps thousands, of old but serviceable cable
     & reel systems.  These could be donated to schools in third world countries,
     to enhance local expansion of the sport.

Because Slim pro?
One day when I was at my place of study (Complutense University of Madrid) I prepared, together with colleagues, for presentation of a work concerning the influence of Roman history in Spain. I remember that this work was group and we all had to agree to develop in the best way the presentation.
Without further ado develop work, but possessed a big problem, we could see the presentation on a screen of acceptable size, because we all had phones with small screens and also had no access to television, we could see the results of our hard work of research.
Between talks and jokes, my colleague (Johan) and I began to discuss the problem, (which was very recurrent among college students) and we wonder why the hell there is no projector audio and video that can bring in the pocket?
At that time we decided (Jonah and I) to
develop a video projector capable carried in a pocket ...
