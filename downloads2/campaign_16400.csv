<h3>Spanish Dance &amp; Me</h3>
<p>I am a Spanish Dance Instructor. Spanish Dance is predominantly a percussive dance; the dancer is also the musician, creating elaborate rhythms and counter-rhythms using castanets, footwork, clapping, finger snaps and an assortment of other methods.</p>
<p>There are four main categories of Spanish Dance, namely: Escuela Bolera, Clasico, Regional, and the most popular Flamenco. ​Spanish dance has since taken on various influences and expanded into a form with immensely diverse and distinctive styles. </p>
<h3>Soul of Spain</h3>
<p>This is a lecture demonstration on Spanish Dances, designed to introduce audiences to a wide range of dance genres from Spain, including but not limited to Flamenco.

<p>""Soul of Spain"" is being held as part of the Got To Move 2016 programme, and therefore has free registration. However, I still need a lot of help to cover the costs of presenting ""Soul of Spain""!</p>
<p>I'm looking to raise roughly SGD 4300, or USD 3200 (original budget was SGD 4800; SGD500 has been granted under the GTM2016 programme). This will go towards paying first and foremost for items such as: Mdm. Blacher's fees, rehearsal space, flooring, technicians' cost, and programme collatorals. I'd also like to be able to pay for a guitarist, and to leave something aside for the production team, who would otherwise be doing this without compensation.</p>
<p>I committed to this project despite limited funds and the heavy risk as I believe that there is much that needs to be done to dispel misconceptions about Spanish Dance, as well as to show the different nuances and evolution, and there is no better person to helm it than Mdm. Blacher, who has had over 60 years of experience in this field.</p>

I am a Spanish Dance Instructor. Spanish Dance is predominantly a percussive dance; the dancer is also the musician, creating elaborate rhythms and counter-rhythms using castanets, footwork, clapping, finger snaps and an assortment of other methods.
There are four main categories of Spanish Dance, namely: Escuela Bolera, Clasico, Regional, and the most popular Flamenco. ​Spanish dance has since taken on various influences and expanded into a form with immensely diverse and distinctive styles. 
Soul of Spain
This is a lecture demonstration on Spanish Dances, designed to introduce audiences to a wide range of dance genres from Spain, including but not limited to Flamenco. It covers not only the different categories of Spanish Dance, but also the use of unique props (eg: castanets, bata de colas). This provides audiences with a broader view of Spanish Dance and the understanding that there are many different areas of dance that a practitioner may choose to excel in.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Based off the tragic incidents of the LRA army in Uganda, Nankunda is a short story about a boy who is captured by the LRA. This tragic incident leads to the awful moment where he must decide to either kill his mother or watch her be killed before he dies as well. This moving story reflects the true essence of a mother's love and the sacrifice that is more powerful than hatred.</p>
<p>About The Director:</p>
<p>In the past seven years, Alyssa Sprague has traveled to China, Rwanda, Kazakhstan, and the Philippines where she’s gotten most of her inspiration for her stories. Her first book, A Step Outside is scheduled to be published within the next five months with Tate Publishing Company. She was assistant director of Willy Wonka at BellMar Theatricals and dance director for Alice and Wonderland at Hillcrest High School. She is an experienced dancer who started in gymnastics at the age of six. She’s trained in acro, tumbling, jazz, contemporary, hip hop, ballet, lyrical, modern and musical theatre. She performed in musicals like Chicago and A Chorus Line with BellaMar Theatricals where she directed her own original dance show, A Step Outside. She was also a member of the hip hop crew Natural State and did a series of choreography projects throughout the Inland Empire. Currently, Alyssa dances with the Blackbird Dance Company in Hollywood and is building a number of online markets. She lives in Fullerton with her husband and it looking forward to the prospects headed her way.</p>
<p>Alyssa Liu is a dancer and writer, with a heart of gold. She has made it her mission in life to help the children in undeveloped countries. She wrote Nankunda to raise awareness about the hardships that children in  Central Africa have to endure.</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>We are producing Nankunda to be a stage play, where many influential people will be invited to the premiere. We are confident that everyone in attendance will love the show, and our hope is that this will raise awareness for the cause. </li>
<li>If the play is well received and we are able to raise enough funds, the next step in the plan will be to turn Nankunda into a feature film. This of course, would be the ultimate way to help the children as a substantial portion of the proceeds from the film will go to organizations like UNICEF which dedicate themselves to helping children in these impoverished countries.</li>
</ul>
<p>Did you know...</p>
<p>-Because of a poor distribution of wealth, the Uganda government spends only 1.9% of it's GDP on health</p>
<p>-Uganda's GDP per capita is only $332, marking it as one of the poorest countries in the world.</p>
<p>-There are only 4 doctors and 28 nurses per every 100,000 people in Uganda.</p>
<p>- 23.1 million Ugandans are likely to fall into poverty and about 8.4 million are trapped in absolute poverty.</p>

<p>You can help us turn this project into a reality, no matter how much you give:</p>
<ul>
<li>We need at least $3,000 to rent a theater for a night. Everyone will be invited to come free of charge.</li>
<li>We would like to feed our guests as well. This will cost an additional $1,500.</li>
<li>Currently, the dancers and choreographers are rehearsing the play without getting paid for their time. If we can raise another $3,000 we can pay each dancer at least for doing the play.</li>
<li>If we can produce another trailer with footage from the actual play when it takes place, this will generate a great deal of energy and help us raise the necessary funds to turn the play into a movie! Production of another trailer will cost us $4,500 for a professional-looking video.</li>

<p>ANNE BOLEYN FOR PRESIDENT OF THE CLASS OF 2014 is the inaugural production of our company: Off With Her Head Productions. Inspired by the tragic ends of women like Anne Boleyn and Marie Antoinette, the mission of this company is to take stories about women and re-imagine them, whether that be by placing classic stories in a modern setting, or taking stereotypes of women that have pervaded until today, and turning them on their heads. We are also interested in exploring the ways that women have and can break out of social constructs that have been imposed on them.

The show uses haunting live music to tell the story of a young Boy who bottles up his heart and throws it into the sea. Original song-writing (Avi's job!) is set to breathtaking visuals centred around a beautifully carved wooden chest (Peter's creation!) that holds the secrets to the story.<br/> <br/>Intricate puppets are swept through a transforming wooden world created by the spectacular chest. Backdrops flip up, pirouette and change, sending the Boy tumbling through danger and discovery. Puppets roam on this unique contraption to recount the story of whales, tiny boats, sea captains and beards.<br/>  <br/><em>A Heart at Sea</em> was launched in April 2016 in a secret garden, in the pilgrim’s city of Canterbury at the <a href=""http://www.wisewords.co.uk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">WiseWords</a> Festival. Since then it has embarked on a Spring 2017 Tour, was nominated for Les Enfants Terribles LET AWARD, and landed a spot in The Pleasance programme at the Edinburgh Festival 2017. The production was grown out of a love for storytelling, live music and puppetry.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1499617785/ldjaaqqjfbkrtwgsfwyv.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/><strong>Why The Edinburgh Festival?</strong><br/><br/>The Edinburgh Festival is the worlds largest Arts Festival. Being a part of the festival, means having the unique opportunity to showcase your creative work to programmers, press and agencies. Out show will be on at highly credible venue, The Pleasance: Courtyard, and you can find our listing <a href=""https://www.pleasance.co.uk/event/heart-sea"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>. For us, this ultimately means the chance to reach more and more audiences with A Heart At Sea, in Edinburgh, in the UK, and internationally.<br/><br/>As many of you will know, taking work to the Edinburgh Festival is no small feat. The costs are high, and the only means to make your money back is tickets sales. It is hard to break even, and we are aware of the risks. The biggest way to get people through the door to the show, is to hand out flyers on the days. Our goal with this campaign, as well as the hard work we put in in the three weeks we are performing, is to help us do the Edinburgh Festival without making a loss.<br/><br/><strong>This is where your contribution comes in!</strong><br/><br/><strong>Important Contribution no.1:</strong>  We need help to foot the cost of posters and flyers, so we can  hand out flyers everyday to families, passersby, and audiences for other theatre shows. Pete has already designed a strategic flyer-ing schedule, to make sure we can maximise our audiences, but we need the print itself. The money raised in this campaign will cover the cost of printing thousands of flyers to help us sell the show.<br/><br/><strong>Important Contribution No.2:</strong> A bed for Peter. As we're sure you'll agree, a roof over the head is better than no roof over the head. Particularly when performing. For 26 days straight. SO we figured we should probably pay to put Pete up somewhere, as well as our lovely lighting designer Ines, and the few volunteers who are helping us flyer. Very Important! So the rest of the money will go towards the cost of accommodation for these lovely folk.<br/><br/> </p>

</div></div>","About The ShowA Heart At Sea is an epic musical folktale told on a miniature scale. The show uses haunting live music to tell the story of a young Boy who bottles up his heart and throws it into the sea. Original song-writing (Avi's job!) is set to breathtaking visuals centred around a beautifully carved wooden chest (Peter's creation!) that holds the secrets to the story. Intricate puppets are swept through a transforming wooden world created by the spectacular chest. Backdrops flip up, pirouette and change, sending the Boy tumbling through danger and discovery. Puppets roam on this unique contraption to recount the story of whales, tiny boats, sea captains and beards.  A Heart at Sea was launched in April 2016 in a secret garden, in the pilgrim’s city of Canterbury at the WiseWords Festival. Since then it has embarked on a Spring 2017 Tour, was nominated for Les Enfants Terribles LET AWARD, and landed a spot in The Pleasance programme at the Edinburgh Festival 2017. The production was grown out of a love for storytelling, live music and puppetry.
Why The Edinburgh Festival?The Edinburgh Festival is the worlds largest Arts Festival. Being a part of the festival, means having the unique opportunity to showcase your creative work to programmers, press and agencies. Out show will be on at highly credible venue, The Pleasance: Courtyard, and you can find our listing here. For us, this ultimately means the chance to reach more and more audiences with A Heart At Sea, in Edinburgh, in the UK, and internationally.As many of you will know, taking work to the Edinburgh Festival is no small feat. The costs are high, and the only means to make your money back is tickets sales. It is hard to break even, and we are aware of the risks. The biggest way to get people through the door to the show, is to hand out flyers on the days. Our goal with this campaign, as well as the hard work we put in in the three weeks we are performing, is to help us do the Edinburgh Festival without making a loss.This is where your contribution comes in!Important Contribution no.1:  We need help to foot the cost of posters and flyers, so we can  hand out flyers everyday to families, passersby, and audiences for other theatre shows. Pete has already designed a strategic flyer-ing schedule, to make sure we can maximise our audiences, but we need the print itself. The money raised in this campaign will cover the cost of printing thousands of flyers to help us sell the show.Important Contribution No.2: A bed for Peter. As we're sure you'll agree, a roof over the head is better than no roof over the head. Particularly when performing. For 26 days straight. SO we figured we should probably pay to put Pete up somewhere, as well as our lovely lighting designer Ines, and the few volunteers who are helping us flyer. Very Important! So the rest of the money will go towards the cost of accommodation for these lovely folk. 

What We Need & What You Get

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>Little Epic Theatre are Naomi Carter and Vince Stadon.  We met in 2011 when Naomi joined the cast of <i>The Bristol Sitcom Trials</i>, which Vince produced for 4 years. Naomi wrote and starred in several winning scripts (one of which made the finals of <i>So You Think You Write Funny?</i> at the Gilded Balloon), and as Vince branched out into writing and producing comedy plays (including <i>Checkpoint Dave</i> and <i>Sherlock Holmes and the Devil's Whisper</i>), Naomi wrote and starred in <i>Barbara and Jeffrey</i>, her first one act play, which was a hit in Bristol and Bath.  Vince and Naomi bring hilarious new writing to stages across the south west, without breaking any laws.  Well, not many.</li>
<li>We want to workshop key moments from our latest play, an ambitious two act comedy with four interlinked stories and complicated slapstick sequences.</li>
<li>Workshopping new writing is vital to the process because without seeing what the play looks like on its feet - with actors performing key moments - we have no real idea of what we've written, or how it can be staged.  We need to see bits of our play to understand it.  And perhaps to understand ourselves.  I mean, we wrote this thing.  What does it say aqbout us?  We urgently need to know.  Our Therapy depends on it. </li>
<li>Plus, filming/photographing the workshop is part of our pledge to share with the public every part of the process of writing and staging a play.  You can read all about the writing of the play on our blog here: <a href=""http://littleepictheatre.blogspot.co.uk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://littleepictheatre.blogspot.co.uk/</a>
</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>We need £500 to pay actors, hire a space, feed our cast and film the workshop.  We have a cast of twelve, but for the workshop we'll need only seven or eight actors (there will be some doubling-up of roles).  We need these actors for two days - we're looking at a weekend in November - and we'll need to pay them for their time and feed them while they do what they do so brilliantly. We'll be looking to hire a space in central Bristol (at £50 per day), and we'll record everything on camera, including the tantrums that inevitably erupt when we run out of biscuits.</li>
<li>We have unique perks to offer our backers!  We could have been lazy and just had a load of cheap mugs and t-shirts printed with the Little Epic logo, but we've gone that extra mile for you and we're creating unique items! (Plus, we couldn't get cheap mugs and t-shirts printed with the Little Epic logo). From sending you insulting letters, to singing songs about you, painting your portraits and remaking your favourite movies, we've got a personalised perks package tailored to our backers - you won't want to miss out!</li>
<li>If we don't reach full funding, we'll film ourselves crying.  But we were going to do that anyway (crying with tears of joy and relief), so you might as well give us the full funding.  If we don't get it all, we'll put whatever we have reached towards the workshop, fulfil the pledges, and we'll look to other means of reaching the full amount. </li>
</ul>
</div><div> </div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<ul><li>Getting new theatre made is very difficult.  By and large audiences prefer to go and see plays they've heard of starring people they've heard of, in theatres they've heard of.  The Bristol Old Vic, for instance, could stage <i>The Importance of Being Earnest,</i> starring Nigel Havers, forever and ever and ever, and sell out every night.  People really love Nigel Havers.  We have written something new, something complicated to stage, something that's a big risk.  We've staged new plays in small theatres above pubs, and it's been great fun - but with this play we need a bigger stage, which means we'll need to attract bigger audiences, and that's increasingly difficult.  The workshop will provide us with a wealth of visual material (including clips) that we can actually show to people in the industry to get feedback, and/or eventually funding and staging.  It's risky, but we have faith in our play, and we're determined to bring The Art of Getting Unlucky to the best theatres in the west country, and bring in the audiences that make the endeavour successful. </li></ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Please get the word out and make some noise about our campaign. And we mean that literally - get yourself a megaphone (everyone should have a megaphone!) and shout, ""Little Epic Theatre need your help!"" to people on buses and in chemist's.</li>
<li>And remember to use the Indiegogo share tools!</li>

<p><strong>The Project</strong></p>
<p>In “Elizabeth Wants a Sword Fight” a young girl sets out in search of adventure, as embodied by a real sword fight. She journeys through strange lands and wanders in and out of various Shakespeare plays. She meets Rosalind and Celia (from As You Like It) lost in the Forest of Arden, takes an ocean cruise with Prince Hamlet and his best friends Rosie and Gil, is drafted by some Scottish witches to replace a missing member of their trio. She fights Bohemian bears, tangles with pirates and knights, and lands right in the middle of the political intrigue surrounding the Empty Crown. And all the while, her nemesis is lurking in wait.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The original play, written by company co-founder Alan Irvine, combines both physical comedy and wit with high-energy action and sword play. We are currently hard at work preparing the play for its world premier at the 2017 Pittsburgh Fringe Festival March 31-April 2.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Your Help</strong></p>
<p>As a small company, we work hard to keep expenses low. Performing at Fringe Festivals helps with that. For example, we don’t have to rent an entire venue by ourselves. But we do need to cover our application and performance fees with the Fringe. And we always discover that we need  some props or costumes that none of us have stashed in our closets. And we want to publicize the show so that audiences can find us. The more of these costs we can cover up front, the more ticket revenue can go directly to the actors. And then they can buy things like food. Well fed actors give better performances.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Who is Brawling Bard?</strong><br/>We are a small company. Some of us are full-time performers, some of us combine performing with other occupations. Once or twice a year we come together to work on a new show. We do original works, written by company co-founder Alan Irvine, that mix comedy, Shakespeare, and stage combat. Since many members of the company have been with us since the beginning, Alan can write parts for specific actors, matching the characters to each actor’s strength and style, just as Shakespeare himself did. At the same time, we always look for new actors to invite in to join us. With two stage combat professionals in the company, we strive to include plenty of high quality, high energy, high enjoyment fight action in all our shows. And most important, we work hard to make sure our audiences have fun.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our first show won the Audience Choice award at the 2014 Pittsburgh Fringe Festival, our second show won the Golden Crow (Spirit of the Fringe Award) at the 2015 Pittsburgh Fringe Festival, and our third show won the Best Ensemble Award in 2016. With your help, our 2017 show will be even better than these.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Janet Aisawa and I created, direct and perform in ""Them,""   a multimedia dance that will be presented by The Performance Project at University Settlement.   After twelve years, “Them” will finally be complete.  It will include interviews with my aunts, uncles, and their friends, Japanese Americans, who were forced from their homes and placed in concentration camps in the United States during WWII.  </p>
<p>This project is important to me because it passes down these stories to a new generation.  I hope it will start conversations and questions about what it means to be “them” and “us”  and about seeing people as people, rather than ""others"" or enemies. </p>
<p>Yuko Takebe’s film, “Shadows of Hiroshima” will be shown with the dances.  The film asks, “How do we live in the world today with the atomic bomb?""</p>
<p>At the end of June, two new dances will be added to complete “Them” at the performances at University Settlement.  We will also have an exhibit of pictures, historical items, and some additional video interviews that are not included in the performances.  The exhibit will be shown on the second floor of the University Settlement and will give background to the dances in ""Them.""</p>
<p>Before the performances the audience members will be invited to make origami cranes containing their wishes for peace as part of the Cranes for Peace Project.   I will place a string of 1,000 of the cranes on Sadako’s Children’s Memorial in Hiroshima, Japan in August, to commemorate the 72nd anniversary of the atomic bombing of the city.  Sadako was a little girl who survived the blast but died at the age of 12 from leukemia caused by radiation from the bomb.  The cranes are a symbol of her legacy for hope and peace. </p>
<p>I want to express my deepest gratitude to all who have supported my efforts to tell the stories in “Them”.   This support has made a huge difference in the process of creating “Them.”  Now in order to complete this work, I am asking for additional significant support. </p>

<p>Can we have a serious conversation about a problem and still be able to laugh? That’s what we here at kamrDANCE are asking in our upcoming premiere of our newest work “Catch 22”, a satirical piece about the double bind that exists for women in society, especially in positions of power.</p>
<p>My name is Alexis Robbins and I'm the Artistic Director and choreographer of kamrDANCE, a tap and contemporary/modern dance company. We have been making work and performing in NYC and Massachusetts since 2015 and we are currently embarking on our biggest project yet - premiering a 35 minute piece at Dixon Place called ""Catch 22""! This campaign is important to us because we believe the message of this work is a vital conversation to be had. We also plan to continue creating new comedic, satirical, and important work to bring to as many audiences as possible. Any donation amount is helpful and will help us move forward in our preparation process for ""Catch 22"".</p>
<p>kamrDANCE is looking to raise $950 which will cover rehearsal space, costumes, stage manager compensation, and most importantly, dancer compensation. Often today, dancers in emerging companies have to rehearse for free due to lack of funds and with your help our dancers will be compensated the rates they deserve. As a company we rehearse for this show specifically 1-2 times a week for 2-3 hours at a time. Rehearsal space can cost anywhere from $15-30/hour.

This year marks the twentieth anniversary of RCP's Shakespeare Players program producing <i>free</i> Shakespeare in Highland Park!</p>
<p>Shakespeare’s witty comedy subverts the rules of gender and romance. The play contrasts the regimented court of Duke Frederick and the Forest of Arden, where freedom provides relief from fraternal conflicts. <i>As You Like It</i> already embraces the power of freedom, love, and rebellion, and our production will highlight those themes by setting the story within the musical backdrop of Woodstock.</p>
<p>Your support makes it possible for us to present the show for <i>free </i>and to share our work with thousands of people in the Rochester community.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Sharon and Kara met two years ago at a write-a-thon at Epiphany Space – a coworking office in Hollywood. We instantly hit it off, and have continued writing and brainstorming together ever since. The inspiration to work together on a play for Fringe came at a Christmas party last December, and next thing we knew, we were at one of the first Fringe Q&amp;A events to learn exactly how to make this crazy idea happen!</p>
<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">About the show</span></h3>
<p>Our show is an immersive comedy experience where the audience becomes part of the show. They'll move through three different rooms and see two different stories unfold, interact with the actors, complete tasks and laugh their way through the production that takes place in a real-life Hollywood co-working office.</p>
<p>The first play, written and directed by Kara Christensen is called <strong>“Rainbow Bright Power Naps.” </strong>It's a madcap comedy, where everything that can go wrong during a board meeting does.</p>
<p>The second play, written and directed by Sharon McKay is titled <strong>“John Stamos is My Baby Daddy.”</strong> It's the story of Audrey, who plans to make a big announcement when she throws a 4th of July party for her family and friends. But absolutely nothing about this party goes according to plan. This comedic play delves into the feminist ideal that women can have it all.</p>
<h3>How your contributions will help</h3>
<ul>
<li>Putting on a play is more expensive than we expected, even at a fringe festival!</li>
<li>Your support will help cover costs such as fees and insurance, props, costumes, food for our talented cast and crew, marketing, and a donation to Epiphany Space - our wonderful venue that brought us all together.</li>
<li>Through your support, we will be able to provide our audiences with the highest quality experience, one that will leave smiles on everyone's faces - even yours!</li>
</ul>

<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>What our budget looks like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Insurance for the actors and the audience members ($450)</li>
<li>Registration fee for Fringe ($250)</li>
<li>Costumes, props and consumables (office supplies, party supplies)</li>
<li>Meals for our cast and crew</li>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Today, making art that comments on our society is more important than ever. This project brings together a group of Hollywood creatives to achieve this goal,</p>

<p>Jessica Kurtzman, 23, and Ryan Evans, 20, both Santa Barbara natives, have collectively been part of the theater and dance communities of Santa Barbara for over 20 years. They have grown from performers to producers, directors and choreographers in this time, and have had the mentorship of many adults they respect over the years. Now they are ready to take on the role of mentoring others.</p>
<p>Jessica has trained in dance in the Santa Barbara community since she was four years old. She began her training with Steven Lovelace, whom she now counts as one of her mentors and best friends of almost 20 years. Her involvement in theater stretches from Stage Left Productions to choreographing and performing in the Santa Barbara School of Performing Arts' productions of RENT (2014) and Swing! (2015). Jessica served as Steven's dance assistant at Stage Left and later became an Assistant Choreographer. She has since become an integral part of the Stage Left family. She studied dance at University of Washington and hopes to work in the entertainment business after college.</p>
<p>Ryan Evans has been involved with theater from a young age and hopes to pursue theater production as a career. He is currently a second year student at SBCC and will be transferring to Marymount Manhattan College to study Producing and Management in the fall. Ryan studied performance with the Dos Pueblos Theater Company, and Stage Left Productions, in addition to many other companies. He served as a co-producer at SB TIYA for Swapped 2016, and as assistant producer at Stage Left Productions in 2016. </p>

<h3><strong>A Little About Me:</strong></h3>
<ul><li>I am a long time performer and dancer. At 26 years old, I have been dancing since the age of 10. Reluctant to express, I was not always the front runner, first draft pick or audition favorite. Therefore, I created a dance platform for normal people to be able to take classes without them being extremely difficult, yet still be exciting and fun!  Over the years I have studied Katherine Dunham technique,  performed with ""The Joffrey Ballet"" and taken various dance courses to perfect my craft.  This dance studio means the world to me! Not for personal reasons, but more so to have the opportunity to create a space for others to utilize.  When I first started I had ""Zero"" students for the first 6 months. You would think I would have quit right? Nope, I decided to keep having classes and eventually promoting them more professionally on social media.  Over the course of a year, I had over 2,000 clients.  I currently rent other venues and between the rent and not being stable this dance studio is mandatory for me at this point in my life. Every effort and donation helps!</li></ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>The funding is being broken down onto several portions. Rehab, construction, cosmetics, licensing, studio needs and marketing. The rental space is at an all time low. The location is wonderful location and convenient near an expressway, so I want to put the time to fix this place up. Let's begin! The flooring needs to be done to become dance appropriate, as the flooring is now carpet and cement. The building needs an entire professional cleaning and extermination  The walls need to be stripped and re-painted. The property needs air to keep us in a comfortable climate during class, especially with all that sweat. All of the electrical units needs to be repaired and new lighting needs to be installed. The entire bathroom needs to be remodeled from the tile, to the sink, paint, mirror, decor and all! The dance studio is not a studio with sound systems and mirrors. Body length mirrors need to be professionally ordered and installed. I want to purchase new software to run the business properly and completely organized. The outside of the property needs an entire new reface. New doors need to be installed throughout the space and a new walls needs to be installed to separate the lobby from the studio.  Studio props are also needed (Mats, bars, and fitness tools and weights)  for safe profesional training. The lobby needs to be equipped to give guests a wonderful first walk in experience and security systems have to also be in place. The property needs work, plenty of other ins and outs with construction and cosmetics. Material alone has estimated 12,000 and labor cost have estimated about $6,000 . No donation is too small, Every donation counts! I will be funding a large portion of my own savings to the project as well. </li>
<li>As for the business to properly run, funds for business license, trademarks, and company logos along with other legalities must be in place.</li>
<li>Perks for contributions are fantastic! Bags, T-shirts, Free classes and more! You will definitely be thanked for contributing to this project!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>Dance is an underrated stress reliever. So many people take the various classes I offer to relieve stress and simply put a smile on their face.</li>
<li>The adult classes I teach for women help them boost confidence, feel empowered,  lose weight, and become healthier mentally and physically. </li>
<li>There are no similar studios in the area I am opening in and the neighborhood could use something positive like this nearby. Not only for the adults but the teens and kids as well.</li>
<li>I have been teaching classes for almost 4 years now and went from a 2,000 client base to 6, 000 clients and have now begun teaching all over the world.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<ul><li>Challenges are always welcome to arise, that's life. However I have been in seminars, trainings and classes to better equip myself to handle the property. I have a team ready to be hired with excellent values and qualifications. This team will make this entire business run smoothly. </li></ul>

I performed this vulnerable poem during an open share and (to my surprise) my generally compassionate, mostly white classmates literally had no idea what I was talking about. They had never noticed these things happening to me or the power dynamics that affected me this way. I decided to reach out to my Philly friends to see if they had ever felt these hurdles in their art making. This project was born as a response to those forces that restrict our art, yet remain invisible to our white allies.</p><h3>What?</h3><p><strong><i>A Day in the Life of an Artist of Color </i>is an ongoing project that brings together Artists of Color in Philadelphia through the curation of both digital and physical spaces. </strong>It consists of three phases: a series of social media spotlights, social mixers, and collaborative photo series (Phase 1); a film project featuring materials from selected artists developed in the previous phase (Phase 2); and a live multimedia performance centered around the film (Phase 3).</p><p>Each part is purposefully designed to highlight Artists of Color in Philadelphia and showcase their work on their own terms. <strong>To create this project we are bringing together musicians, performers, dancers, craft-people, poets, filmmakers, and more to create a community that truly reflects the plurality of our experiences.</strong></p><h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Part 1</strong></h2><h3 style=""text-align: center;""><i><u>The Spotlight Series</u></i></h3><p><strong>This phase focuses on Spotlighting local Philadelphia Artists of Color on Social Media</strong>. Each artist is given the poem ""Drain Ourselves"" as a prompt.

During my time there I wrote a poem called ""Drain Ourselves"" about the tokenization, fetishization, and subsequent white washing I have felt as a performer in the Philadelphia theatre community. In my poem I wondered, if I have been praised as an artist due to my trauma and experience as a Person of Color, or due to the actual quality of my work. I performed this vulnerable poem during an open share and (to my surprise) my generally compassionate, mostly white classmates literally had no idea what I was talking about. They had never noticed these things happening to me or the power dynamics that affected me this way. I decided to reach out to my Philly friends to see if they had ever felt these hurdles in their art making. This project was born as a response to those forces that restrict our art, yet remain invisible to our white allies.What?A Day in the Life of an Artist of Color is an ongoing project that brings together Artists of Color in Philadelphia through the curation of both digital and physical spaces. It consists of three phases: a series of social media spotlights, social mixers, and collaborative photo series (Phase 1); a film project featuring materials from selected artists developed in the previous phase (Phase 2); and a live multimedia performance centered around the film (Phase 3).Each part is purposefully designed to highlight Artists of Color in Philadelphia and showcase their work on their own terms. To create this project we are bringing together musicians, performers, dancers, craft-people, poets, filmmakers, and more to create a community that truly reflects the plurality of our experiences.Part 1The Spotlight SeriesThis phase focuses on Spotlighting local Philadelphia Artists of Color on Social Media. Each artist is given the poem ""Drain Ourselves"" as a prompt. Using the images and concepts described in the text- artists conceptualize their own photo shoot that shows their experience as an Artist of Color in the Philadelphia Artist community.This also extends into our Artist Mixers which feature POC food/ art vendors, as well as other local businesses from all over Philadelphia. Our first Artist Mixer  took place on January 20th and had over 200 guests! In the weeks leading up to the event, each Vendor or Performer also received their own Artist Spotlight on Social Media. The vendors featured range from street performers who do their business at Rittenhouse or on Subway platforms, to recent High School grads, to local businesses and restaurants run by POC. All Artist Mixers are Pay-What-You-Can because we subscribe to the belief that anything that is inaccessible to the poor is neither Radical nor Revolutionary!The Spotlight Series is an ongoing portion of the project. It will evolve and grow throughout 2018 to always be showcasing more Artists of Color in new ways.Part 2The FilmUsing the poem ""Drain Ourselves,"" the film depicts the journeys of Philadelphia artists, activists, and makers, as they navigate privilege and art world access here in Philly. Each artist will will team up with our cinematographer to create their own individual piece to visualize, respond to, or even question a section of the poem.  Our post-production team will then turn these mini movies, individually called ""UnScenes"" into one integrated film. This film will be free and accessible to all online.Part 3The Live EventsThis phase is our version of a movie premier. It will wrap up the other two phases by featuring Artists/ Food Vendors/ Businesses of Color from all over Philadelphia.  The screening of the film will celebrate the work of the artists involved as well as all Artists of Colors. People of Color are so often silenced or policed in artistic spaces- this phase will celebrate and highlight the joy of People of Color, as well as create opportunities for Artists of Color to showcase their work and relate to the film.The essential message of the project- from the way it will be made, to the writing of the film- is community building over perpetuating broken systems of oppression within liberal institutions, all the while celebrating the joy with which Artists of Color make and create their own histories.How You Can Participate!The biggest hurdle in our art-making is money and access.This is where you come in.  We are committed to paying Artists of Color what they deserve for their work, but to tell this story we need your help! We are calling on you now to participate any way you can in this art-action.Part 1 requires- space rentals, vendor table rentals, donated alcohol, props and costumes for curated Photo-series.Part 2 requires- equipment rentals, on-location shooting space rental, costume costs, performer fees, lighting equipment, sound equipment, editing fees, and providing cooked meals and travel stipends to the artists on set.Part 3 requires- venue space rentals, vendor table rentals, projection equipment for filmTo accommodate Artists of Color of all kinds we are determined to create a process that meets artists where they are. Therefore, food on set and travel stipends are always calculated in order to ensure this process is accessible to all artists who participate in this project.These are just a few of the things your support will be directly funding.  Any small amount you are able to contribute will go towards Artists of Color in our community!Be an ally however you can!

<h3>About The Great Brown Bear</h3>
<p>Hi there! My name is Kierna Conner, and I'm an actress and creative living in the Big Apple. I graduated from the University of Arizona in 2016 with my BFA in Musical Theatre, and I have experience with project management, event planning, and entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>I've spent the past year writing, conceptualizing and workshopping a new work I've written called The Great Brown Bear. It's an immersive, surrealist adaptation of a classic Nordic folktale I loved as a child called 'East o' the Sun, West o' the Moon'. The Great Brown Bear uses the folktale as a lens to frame the journey of two lovers as they navigate what it means to relate to each other in a truthful way. This show is deeply personal to me because it's based on some of the most important romantic relationships in my life- my own, and more importantly, the one modeled to me by my parents. The show uses many important elements of my childhood and my family's culture to support our story, such as elements of my family's Finnish and Nordic heritage, poetry, and movement in honor of my late mother who was a dancer. </p>
<p>In May of 2018, I submitted the show to the competitive New York International Fringe Festival, and it was accepted! We've been given a week long run from October 12th-16th, 2018, but we need your help to make it happen!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In order to make The Great Brown Bear's inaugural run a reality, we're asking for $3,500 of financial help from you, our community. Putting on a theatrical production is expensive, and we're looking for financial support in order to allow this show to find the foothold it needs in the competitive New York theatre world. The $3,500.00 will cover: </p>
<ul>
<li>the $1,000.00 venue and technical fee charged to us by FringeNYC</li>
<li>$600.00 of advertising in the Fringe program guide, contained in TimeOut Magazine! </li>
<li>$400.00 for costume and set materials (I'll be doing the costume and set labor myself!) </li>
<li>a financial stipend to try to convey to each of our 9 cast members and our beloved choreographer, Josh Dunn, how much we appreciate their hard work and skill!</li>
</ul>
<p>Those who help support us in our very first efforts to bring The Great Brown Bear to life get some SUPER cool perks! Contributors can receive things like signed photos and posters, cast recordings of our original music, one-of-a-kind props from the show, and more! </p>
<p>Any financial support we receive will help us fund The Great Brown Bear. Whether we don't quite make our financial goal, or we soar over and above it, the funds will go straight towards making it the best that it can be! Any additional funds we receive over the original goal will go directly towards additional compensation for our team (who are each doing EXCEPTIONAL work for far less than they are worth!) and supporting the larger goal of finding a more permanent home for The Great Brown Bear.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The world of independent theatre is competitive, and it's easy to feel discouraged from creating original work when there are so many obstacles to overcome. But we believe the world needs to hear more new stories- and that the world needs to hear <u>this</u> story! Our story is a story of hope, of vulnerability, and of what it means to live in the present moment, in all of it's uncertainty and risk.

</div></div>","About The Great Brown Bear
Hi there! My name is Kierna Conner, and I'm an actress and creative living in the Big Apple. I graduated from the University of Arizona in 2016 with my BFA in Musical Theatre, and I have experience with project management, event planning, and entrepreneurship.
I've spent the past year writing, conceptualizing and workshopping a new work I've written called The Great Brown Bear. It's an immersive, surrealist adaptation of a classic Nordic folktale I loved as a child called 'East o' the Sun, West o' the Moon'. The Great Brown Bear uses the folktale as a lens to frame the journey of two lovers as they navigate what it means to relate to each other in a truthful way. This show is deeply personal to me because it's based on some of the most important romantic relationships in my life- my own, and more importantly, the one modeled to me by my parents. The show uses many important elements of my childhood and my family's culture to support our story, such as elements of my family's Finnish and Nordic heritage, poetry, and movement in honor of my late mother who was a dancer. 
In May of 2018, I submitted the show to the competitive New York International Fringe Festival, and it was accepted! We've been given a week long run from October 12th-16th, 2018, but we need your help to make it happen!

What We Need & What You Get
In order to make The Great Brown Bear's inaugural run a reality, we're asking for $3,500 of financial help from you, our community. Putting on a theatrical production is expensive, and we're looking for financial support in order to allow this show to find the foothold it needs in the competitive New York theatre world. The $3,500.00 will cover: 

the $1,000.00 venue and technical fee charged to us by FringeNYC
$600.00 of advertising in the Fringe program guide, contained in TimeOut Magazine! 
$400.00 for costume and set materials (I'll be doing the costume and set labor myself!) 
a financial stipend to try to convey to each of our 9 cast members and our beloved choreographer, Josh Dunn, how much we appreciate their hard work and skill!

Those who help support us in our very first efforts to bring The Great Brown Bear to life get some SUPER cool perks! Contributors can receive things like signed photos and posters, cast recordings of our original music, one-of-a-kind props from the show, and more! 
Any financial support we receive will help us fund The Great Brown Bear. Whether we don't quite make our financial goal, or we soar over and above it, the funds will go straight towards making it the best that it can be! Any additional funds we receive over the original goal will go directly towards additional compensation for our team (who are each doing EXCEPTIONAL work for far less than they are worth!) and supporting the larger goal of finding a more permanent home for The Great Brown Bear.

The Impact
The world of independent theatre is competitive, and it's easy to feel discouraged from creating original work when there are so many obstacles to overcome. But we believe the world needs to hear more new stories- and that the world needs to hear this story! Our story is a story of hope, of vulnerability, and of what it means to live in the present moment, in all of it's uncertainty and risk. We believe our story will connect people, and infuse them with the same hope and courage that we have! 
We are a team of creatives and leaders who have combined experience running successful small businesses, planning large scale events, and originating new works in festivals all over the world. We feel confident that this production of The Great Brown Bear will open the door to larger opportunities for the show and for us as creatives and professionals.

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>Hannah wakes up terrified in the middle of the night. She just had another bad dream, but this time her big sister Allie won’t allow them to keep happening. She takes Hannah to a place where she’s never been, at least not while awake - the Dream World. Here where everything is possible, Hannah meets the monsters, giant bugs, and clowns that have been tormenting her. Allie plays with the infinite possibilities to teach her sister how to demystify nightmares using magic and goofiness. But when Allie is faced with terrors of her own, the journey almost comes to an end. She’ll have to deal with the shadows of her fears and the voices of her own judgements. Dream and reality collide, and perception becomes her greatest weapon. Beyond Dreams is a play about family, awareness and courage. </p>
<h3>Why this show?</h3>
<p>No one is a stranger to the sensation of waking up in the middle of the night shaking, sweating and too scared to even turn on the lights. That feeling is even worse when you are unaware that you can protect yourself. I don't think we are helpless as children, we're just unaware of our capacities. </p>
<p>However, dreams are simply fabrications of our imaginary and our imaginary is just the result of what we see, hear, smell on a daily basis. So they happen due to external input. What if we can change that input or lead it in another direction?  And what if we can do that in life too? We can, because we do it all the time. We receive, interpret and register everything that happens unconsciously and we often hurt ourselves with our interpretations. So let's become aware of this process and choose how to interpret. In ""Beyond Dreams"" through games, fantasy and make believe we explore how we can own our fears no matter if we're 6 years old or 40. By the way, this isn't just about nightmares we have when we're asleep, but those we face when we're awake as well.</p>
<p>If you relate to anything that has been said so far, then you know why we're doing this and why we're asking you for your help. We believe that there are stories that need to be told, there are theatre shows that stay with us forever. That's how powerful art is and that's why it deserves support, because it can change anything as long as we let it.</p>

<p>None of the money raised here is intended for the creative team. I know what you're thinking, creators always get the short end of the stick. However that's where marketing and social media sharing comes in! Because if we sell out the show we will be able to pay the artists!</p>
<p>Even if we don't reach our goal this show is happening. Candlelight is always an option and jeans and a t-shirt are a valid costume nowadays.

<h3>Your Impact</h3>
<p>Now you know what we're doing, a family show in the Holiday season. Now you know why we're doing it, because our fears don't have to torment us forever. You even know how we'll do it, two actresses, a stage in Manhattan and a lot of creativity and support from friends. So what else do you need? To know what your participation brings to the table.</p>
<p>This is what you will help create and what your help will make possible:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use sales revenue to actually pay our workers, from the person that made the poster to the person who will be on stage performing.</li>
<li>Bring ticket's prices down! If we achieve our goal ticket's price will drop to half.</li>
<li>Reach more people. With more people spreading the word and funds to invest in marketing we can make sure everyone in New York knows ""Beyond Dreams"" is happening.</li>
<li>And last but not least: Keep the dream alive. We are artists because we believe in art and its contribution to our society. We won't stop creating, exploring, questioning unless it becomes physically impossible. And even then, we'll only accept defeat after every stone has been turned. I'm sure one of those stones is hiding the solution. Maybe that solution is you.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will shout ""Thank You"" from the highest mountain when you join our team! By the way, because we are in New York the highest mountain is the Empire State Building.</p>

<p>DIRECTOR - JOE BARROS</p>
<p>Joe Barros is best known for his work on Broadway such as Cagney, Little Shop of Horrors and Gigi along with many others. Having him on the team will certainly make this show well directed.</p>
<p>We want to bring the real New York City to the stage!  See what it's like for a struggling street performer, dreaming to make it big in one of the toughest cities in the world. This show is a unique experience that combines the art of live magic with film along with street dance, burlesque and live music with an original soundtrack. Our story follows Apollo...a MAGICIAN to be, who doesn't know it yet. He's a man down on his luck who's just looking for his big break. Until one night, when he sneaks into the subway and fate decides to step in. Will he figure out what to do with his life or will he fall flat on his face. Join the struggle, the love and the dream. Watch live as his magic show proves, that all it takes, to live the dream, is the courage to rise above. APOLLO RISING!</p>
<p>WHERE IS IT GOING?</p>
<p>Your pledges will help make our dream become a reality. We're seeking to raise $15,000 to help with production costs such as building stage illusions, custom sets, projector + screen, costuming and refillable prop supplies. </p>
<p>Illusions will make our show bigger and better! Purchasing illusions ""off the rack"" gets quite expensive and uncustomizable, so, we have an illusion builder that will allow us to put our unique stamp on these big stage illusions.</p>
<p>Custom Sets - Even our backdrop screams NEW YORK CITY! We're bringing everything from grafitti art by JB Magday to Broadway marquees. This will immerse the audience right into show.</p>
<p>Now for the good stuff! We've prepared some incredible perks for you! It varies from exclusive performance/rehearsal/blooper footage of Apollo Rising, the original soundtrack, one on one magic lessons, tickets to the show and even a private performance of Apollo Rising at your next event! Take a look and see which one suits you!</p>
<p>Just in case we don't reach the entire goal, we will make do with what we have and still bring you the best show possible. Of course, the show would not reach its full potential if we don't hit the mark so, with your help, we're hoping for the best in hitting our target amount to make this show as spectacular as possible.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I'm Brandon Sharkey.  I'm a playwright and actor and I'm working to bring LeRoy ""Phat Trane"" Johnson's story to the stage for the 2018 Hollywood Fringe Festival  (June 7th-24th, 2018) and I need your help.</p>
<p>Singer/Songwriter LeRoy Johnson was born at Charity Hospital in the city of New Orleans, sometime in the late 1950’s or early 1960’s (we think). In 2005 Hurricane Katrina flooded the hospital, and it’s record room, causing many old files to go unrecovered and the hospital to remain closed to this day.<br/>What happened to young LeRoy Johnson since those early days in New Orleans has always been a mystery. Until now.  Now, freshly out of prison (after 20+ years), with no shortage of rumor and gossip, this mystical musician, who has influenced fans worldwide, is looking for his story to be told to a few final audiences before he heads Home for good. <br/>From other musicians, to artists and politicians, LeRoy “Phat Trane” Johnson has managed to quietly nudge his way into American culture. Any support you can provide this show is incredibly appreciated. And please come hear some of the famous songs and the stories behind them in this new show we call…. <i><strong>Phat Trane: Found</strong></i></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1517774326/mhbkuh66ourkp1s5bd8o.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>------------</p>
<p>I first become aware of Phat Trane while I was vacationing in Spain with my wife.  There was a local Spaniard, our quasi-tour guide,  who wouldn't stop asking me about an American musician, a man he called “Fit Treen”.  He was astonished that I, being an American, hadn’t known more about Phat Trane.  Until finally, he brought me to “Cafe Populart,” a small bar in Madrid that was known for playing American music. As the drinks flowed and the music brought the room alive I was taught about the life of Phat Trane, at least the little that was known.   </p>
<p>Soon our tour guide was gone and our trip was over. With the real world waiting for us back in the United States, the life of Phat Trane Johnson became a hidden secret obscured by uncertainty.  </p>
<p>After doing some research I found out he was sentenced to prison in the 1990’s. I figured he probably died in confinement a few years ago.  So when I found out not only was he alive but that he had recently gotten out of prison, my journey to find him began with an urgency.  And when I found him, well, he was an inspiration for me.  And this show is a product of that inspiration. It is the result of late night storytelling and stack of VHS taped performances.  It's his songs, his stories, his life.  It is Phat Trane, found.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The Hollywood Fringe Festival (June 7th-24th, 2018) is the perfect place to introduce this show and see if we can spread the word about Phat Trane and some of the wisdom he’s slyly be giving to the world while it was busy looking at its phone.  We’ve been lucky enough to receive donations and are able to cover a small percentage of our performance budget but we are reaching out to see if we can get some additional support to cover the remainder of our financial needs.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Our basic expenses include venue costs, technical crew, marketing, and insurance requirements.  Every donation, even smaller dollars, helps us get closer to our goal and is sincerely appreciated.</p>
<p>We have flexible funding, which means that every dollar you give finds its way to us and helps us bring this show to the stage (June 7th-24th, 2018).  If we are lucky enough to get all our expenses covered additional monies will go to booking additional shows and possibly getting a recording of one or more of the live performances.  We can't stress how much every little bit helps.</p>
<p>There are perks for each level of financial giving but nothing can adequately repay the gift of support for the arts.  Your gift is truly a spark that can help ignite creativity and inspiration.  </p>
<p>The Hollywood Fringe Festival (June 7th-24th, 2018) is an annual, community-derived event celebrating freedom of expression and collaboration in the performing arts community.

<p>That includes (creating 3 new shows, re-staging an older show, presenting them for the audience more than 50 times, creating a partnership with students to encourage development, engaging with the dance community through direct talks, creating one festival and partnering in 3 other, getting prizes for one of our shows, being invited to play our shows in different parts of the country and abroad, organising15 workshops, etc).</p>

<p>For this, we decided to press pause for 2 months and not dance our shows in order to be able to focus our attention on what we need to do to create comfort and good visibility for our audience: new chairs and new platforms.  </p>
<p>We build a community around Linotip by constantly offering shows, classes and other events related to contemporary dance. And although this break is more than necessary it's very important to bring new chairs and platforms in this space as soon as possible, to be able to reconnect with the public. </p>
<p>In other words, we want to move fast but not furious and accomplish this new change we need to do. Here's how the space is gonna look with new platforms and a bigger number of chairs. Thanks to a friend architect we have some sketches to show you. </p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Why is this so important? </strong></p>
<p>We want our space to be a model for others to come. To offer our best shows and activities in optimal conditions. We want our team, dancers, audience and partners to feel that this is a place where quality, passion and good energies are highly respected. The modern look of the space and the functions that this space has, draw more and more attention towards contemporary dance and it’s ability to grow again and maybe one day become as visible as theatre and cinema are these days in our country.</p>

</div></div>","The LinoStory

For us, Linotip represents the time and space where we focus our attention on the multiple ways we can enhance the visibility of contemporary dance in the independent art sector.
How do we do that? 

Our artistic direction is mainly oriented towards contemporary dance show productions that are based on physical theatre and performance. Our main goals for the next years consists in

creating and offering to the public a contemporary dance repertory
creating a contemporary dance company
enhancing education through contemporary dance
developing and implementing transdisciplinary cultural programs
research and innovation involving contemporary dance and technology

 
Who's ""Us""?We’re a small yet daring team and if you want to meet us or find out more about us you can contact us at contact@linotip.ro.
 
What we did so far?
We started in 2016, full of energy and positive thinking, with our heads bursting with all sorts of creative ideas and with a little help from our friends, looking back from 2018, we did around 100 individual events successfully.

That includes (creating 3 new shows, re-staging an older show, presenting them for the audience more than 50 times, creating a partnership with students to encourage development, engaging with the dance community through direct talks, creating one festival and partnering in 3 other, getting prizes for one of our shows, being invited to play our shows in different parts of the country and abroad, organising15 workshops, etc).

<h3>Un parcours irrégulier... ça peut être riche!</h3>
<p>Je suis étudiante en danse contemporaine à L'École de danse de Québec. Je termine officiellement cette formation en mai 2019. Auparavant, j'ai terminé mes études en Arts Visuels au Cégep de St-Laurent en 2015. J'ai commencé à pratiquer la danse de manière constante l'âge de 18ans. Voilà pourquoi je suis toujours à le recherche de formations diverses qui pourraient enrichir mon parcours! </p>
<p><strong>Le Projet</strong></p>
<p>Dans un premier temps, ce projet me permettrait d'apprendre un vocabulaire gestuelle nouveau. En tant qu'interprète en danse contemporaine, il est important de pouvoir proposer une variété d'options gestuelles aux chorégraphes. La prochaine année scolaire sera ma dernière dans mon programme et j'aurai la chance de travailler avec plusieurs chorégraphes invités. Cette année déterminera largement mon initiation sur le marché du travail en tant que danseur interprète.</p>
<p><strong>L'importance </strong></p>
<p>Souvent les danseurs qui s'entrainent depuis l'enfance ont une très bonne technique mais n'ont pas nécessairement la chance de vivre autres choses que la danse. Pour un danseur initié tardivement à la discipline, il se trouve souvent à avoir beaucoup de choses à exprimer sans avoir la justesse technique, ce qui ressemble plutôt à mon cas. Ce projet me permettrait de prendre confiance en tant que créateur et danseur dans l'objectif de promouvoir la diffusion d'oeuvres dansées diverses. Encourager la danse! Encourager la relève artistique! Encourager les parcours irréguliers! </p>

Il sera en mesure de choisir le plan d'entraînement le plus approprié en fonction de mes besoins, de ma condition physique, de mon expérience et de mes exigences.</p>
<p>L'entrainement se fait en petit groupe. Je serai associé à une classe d'environ 10 étudiants dirigés par un maître avec une spécialisation de Kung Fu (Shaolin, Sanda, Wing Chun, ou Mantis Boxing). J'aurai aussi le privilège de suivre des sessions individuelles avec un maître de Shaolin.</p>

 Les arts martiaux comme le Kung Fu prend beaucoup de sa puissance technique du bassin. Dans mon cas, en danse, je me suis souvent blessée le bas du dos et le bassin à cause d'un manque de force. Cet entrainement m'est donc optimal pour prévenir d'éventuelle blessures.

<h2>About the show</h2>

<p>Established in 2017, Trip Hazards theatre company aims to innovatively stage fun, fresh and thought-provoking work for modern and diverse audiences. Their energetic, cross-disciplinary shows combine the autobiographical and the absurd, whilst finding creative ways to incorporate spoken word, live music, and rap into the telling of unheard stories.</p>

<h3>Cast &amp; Crew</h3>
<p>Love Songs has emerged due to hard work from a variety of kick-ass female creatives:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alissa Anne Jeun Yi (Writer/Performer)</li>
<li>Anna Jeary (Director)</li>
<li>Tanya Agarwal (Producer)</li>
<li>Mia Lewis (Assistant Producer)</li>
<li>Symoné Performing Artist (Hooping Choreographer) </li>
<li>Annelise Heaton (Illustrator/Animator)</li>
<li>Katt Webster (Fashion Photographer)</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h2>Why we believe in Love Songs...</h2>
<h2>and why you should too</h2>
<p>There are sadly a lot of shows about assault, but we believe we are developing something empowering, unique and fresh. Love Songs aims to present an different and ultimately ‘positive’ narrative about sexual assault arguably lacking in current discourse. This alternative narrative involves not painting those who have experienced rape as ‘survivors’ or ‘victims’, but instead focuses on embracing female vulnerability, allowing us to reclaim and ultimately own the moments we have felt violated and powerless. Regardless of the mistakes, the heartbreaks and the dark times, being able to grow as a person through challenging experiences is simply part of life, and life is worth celebrating.</p>
<p>As a newly-established BAME theatre company we are also driven to start a dialogue about the hyper-sexualised stereotypes East Asian women face daily, whilst giving other Asian women to see themselves properly represented on stage. Exoticised, submissive ideals about Chinese female bodies have long been ingrained in Western culture, but intersectional feminist critiques of this within theatre and other art forms continues to be lacking in proportion to the scope of this issue.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>What your money will support</h2>
<p>For transparency we have provided an outline of our budget for Love Songs below. We are looking to crowdfund a flexible target of £2000 to help cover these costs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fringe Registration, Brochure Entry and Venue Deposit - £1978.95</li>
<li>Accommodation - £2060</li>
<li>Print Marketing Materials - £500</li>
<li>Fuel for Transport - £190.80</li>
<li>Set, Props &amp; Tech Hire - £365.00</li>
<li>Miscellaneous - £50  </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h2>What you'll get in return</h2>
<p>We're delighted to have support from a number of great sponsors (Candy Kittens, Vegan Nights and more) to provide you with some sexy campaign perks to say THANK YOU! In keeping with the message of our show to embrace and enjoy female sexuality, check out our First Date, Treat Yo'Self and Date Night packages to the right...</p>

<h3>About ‘Curbside Players’</h3>
<p>The Curbside Players theatre company was founded in January of 2018 by Natalie Bennett, Ethan &amp; Madison Armstrong. The three met while studying theatre at the University of North Texas in Denton and were bonded by their shared love theatre. After realizing there was a need for innovative classical theatre in their community they determined that their first production as a company should be <i>A Midsummer Night’s Dream. </i>Our company is dedicated to to inspiring others, giving opportunities, and simply creating through the art of theatre. Our mission is to produce authentic shows that encompass the many important aspects of theatre.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><i>A Midsummer Night’s Dream</i></h3>
<p>Our production of William Shakespeare’s classic comedy will be set in America in the 1960’s. Themes of transformation are predominate in the show’s text as well as a defining feature of the sixties making this show an exciting and compelling combination as both the mundane and fantastical will be intermingled. This play, and its conceptualization, strive to emphasize the parallels of the struggles in the 1960’s and politics today, effectively forcing the audience to acknowledge that, while it may not repeat itself exactly, history does rhyme. Since January, our team has been working diligently on this production. We have cut the script ourselves while maintaining the iambic pentameter and rhyme scheme, thoroughly researched our concept, and in May met with Arts Mission Oak Cliff and put down the deposit for the space to stage our show! In June, we met for the first time as a company, to read through our script together and begin our rehearsal process. Since then this entire process has been more than rewarding, and with the help of our members (as well as our friends) we have a model for our set design as well as donated set pieces, posters and other promotional materials already designed, <u>and even an original score</u>!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>There are A LOT of costs involved in producing show and because we are an extremely new company we do not have a surplus of funds to pull from. To help ameliorate the costs we have set up this campaign and other fundraisers, in addition to selling ads in our program/ playbill. Any money donated from this campaign will go towards paying for our venue and event insurance, as they are our two most substantial costs. If we raise any additional funds they will go towards other necessities such as costumes and set dressing.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
</div><div><p>Our three founders have put an immense amount of work into this wonderful and fulfilling project.  They have also been lucky enough to come into contact with some amazing individuals, with out whom, this production would not have been possible. We have had an outpouring of help from our company members, friends, and family that have eased many of the stressors involved in starting a theatre company and staging our first show, which is why money has been our largest hurdle. Currently, this production is being funded entirely by our three founders. Regardless of the total money raised from this campaign or any others the three of them have committed to the costs of this production. This means that your donation is essentially <u>risk free</u>, because the outcome of your donation (the show) is guaranteed. </p></div><div><h3> </h3></div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We completely understand that not everyone can help us by contributing funds, but there are a couple of other ways you can help. Firstly, you can help us promote the show! Like us on Facebook (Curbside Players), follow us on Instagram (@curbsideplayers), and urge others to do the same!!! Secondly, if you or your business are interested in purchasing an ad in our program, email Natalie Bennett at nreneeb@verizon.net.

<h3>Welcome!</h3>
<p>I’m Adanna, the writer of ‘At The Feet Of Jesus’. ATFOJ is set in Brazil during the 2014 World Cup and explores family, football and the sacrifices made to protect your heritage at all cost. This is all brought to life through the oral storytelling of the Brazilian Candomblé tradition<strong>.</strong></p>
<p>We’re raising £3000 to help bring this play to the Omnibus theatre and Young Vic this summer.</p>
<p>By supporting you will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure we’re able to pay all contributors involved.</li>
<li>Support our mentor programme: subsidising two young creatives to join our team &amp; learn about the process of producing a show.</li>
<li>Help us connect with local communities in London via our community performance and workshop at the Young Vic (part of their Neighbourhood Theatre initiative).</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Show's Origins</h3>
<p>During the lead up to the 2014 World Cup and 2016 Olympics I began to watch lots of documentaries about the effect these global events were having on the local residents of Brazil. I was captured by how similar and relatable their stories were to Londoners who were also feeling the effects of gentrification and the impact social class has on communities across the city.</p>
<p>In 2014 a shorter version of my play was chosen as part of the Braziliance Festival by StoneCrabs theatre. In 2016 I developed the play and submitted it to Angelic Tales new writing festival at Theatre Royal Stratford East. It was staged for one night and had a sold out performance. Since then I’ve been working towards transforming the play into a full length production.</p>
<h3>The Show</h3>
<p><i>""...the very clay you walk on runs through our veins..."" </i><br/>Rio 2014, the World Cup. Brazil vs Germany. The streets are electric with excitement, politics, protests and violence.  The Cardoso family are at a crossroads. Hours away from being evicted, they have decide whether to fight to stay where their ancestors have lived for centuries or leave everything they know and love behind.</p>
<p>In their plight for freedom the family discover buried secrets that threaten to pull apart the very thing they treasure most: each other.</p>
<p>How far would you go to protect your family’s legacy?</p>
<p><i>At The Feet Of Jesus</i> is a vibrant and provocative play about family, football and the sacrifices made to protect the ones you love at all costs. All brought to life, through the vibrant oral storytelling of the Brazilian Candomblé tradition<strong>.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Much of the costs for the production has been catered for but we still need to raise additional funds to ensure the show's success. We need the help of contributors like you to make this show happen.</p>
<p>The money raised during this campaign will help to cover the cost of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lighting and Technical Support</li>
<li>Videography (to capture rehearsals and the production)</li>
<li>Costume</li>
<li>Set Design</li>
<li>Mentoring Programme</li>
<li>Marketing</li>
</ul>
<p>To express our gratitude for your support, all contributors will receive a Special Thanks in our program. Some support levels come with added bonuses, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Press night tickets</li>
<li>Signed copy of the script</li>
<li>Exclusive access to rehearsals</li>
<li>VIP ticket to Young Vic performance (entry via invitation only)</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I think it’s really important to explore how we all share the same hopes and fears regardless of country and culture. I wrote ATFOJ with the intention of connecting a British audience with a different perspective of Brazil that’s rarely shown on stage. My hope is that by showing this play, an audience can have fun and enjoy the relatability of the story.</p>
<p>We’re staging a free performance at the Young Vic and collaborating with the theatre as part of their Neighbourhood Theatre initiative. This will provide the opportunity for local communities in London (who don’t often have access to theatre) to watch our show for free. Followed by a fun Q&amp;A and workshop with a Paraiso School of Samba.  </p>
<p>With your support we can create a successful run and the Omnibus and Young Vic which will stand us in good stead to fulfill our future goals for the production: A UK tour of the production and and staging of the play in Brazil itself. Exciting!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Time is the biggest challenging factor as we only have 2 months to bring this project all together by May 2020.</p>
<p>When managing similar projects in the past, I learnt that organisation is the essential to key to succeeding within a tight schedule. We have a dedicated team behind ATFOJ which will maximise the our time by being able to delegate tasks and share responsibilities. This will ensure the best possibility of a successful production.</p>
<p> </p>

To express our gratitude for your support, all contributors will receive a Special Thanks in our program. Some support levels come with added bonuses, including:

Press night tickets
Signed copy of the script
Exclusive access to rehearsals
VIP ticket to Young Vic performance (entry via invitation only)

 

The Impact
I think it’s really important to explore how we all share the same hopes and fears regardless of country and culture. I wrote ATFOJ with the intention of connecting a British audience with a different perspective of Brazil that’s rarely shown on stage. My hope is that by showing this play, an audience can have fun and enjoy the relatability of the story.
We’re staging a free performance at the Young Vic and collaborating with the theatre as part of their Neighbourhood Theatre initiative. This will provide the opportunity for local communities in London (who don’t often have access to theatre) to watch our show for free. Followed by a fun Q&A and workshop with a Paraiso School of Samba.  
With your support we can create a successful run and the Omnibus and Young Vic which will stand us in good stead to fulfill our future goals for the production: A UK tour of the production and and staging of the play in Brazil itself. Exciting!
 

Risks & Challenges
Time is the biggest challenging factor as we only have 2 months to bring this project all together by May 2020.
When managing similar projects in the past, I learnt that organisation is the essential to key to succeeding within a tight schedule. We have a dedicated team behind ATFOJ which will maximise the our time by being able to delegate tasks and share responsibilities. This will ensure the best possibility of a successful production.

<p><strong>Short Summary</strong></p>
<p>“How do I begin when there are few words I can choose??</p>
<p>I’m a Los Angeles based writer who always thought the music of British Synth-Pop duo Erasure would make a fantastic musical.</p>
<p>So, in 2015, I began the journey of  “OH L’AMOUR: The Erasure Musical.”   It’s been a labor of love that ultimately placed me in the same room with legends Vince Clarke and Andy Bell at The Roundhouse London in 2017!!  Their support and encouragement  has fueled continued progress on the show - most recently a table read in L.A. March 8th of this year.</p>
<p>Now, we’re preparing a new, fully-sung OH L’AMOUR!  With a talented cast of actors and dancers, this showcase will be recorded and made available for streaming later this year.</p>
<p><strong>How Can You Help?</strong></p>
<p>The money raised in this campaign will be used to cover costs of a new production that will be used to attract theatrical producers to OH L'AMOUR such as recording new tracks for 24 Erasure songs!  “Phantom Bride” as a lullaby?  “Sometimes” as a country western ballad?  Telling the OH L’AMOUR story requires new versions of all our favorite Erasure songs.  </p>Benefits of your support to include show swag, signed show memorabilia.  These will evolve over the course of the campaign - so check in often!<p><strong>Why “OH L’AMOUR?”</strong></p>
<p>OH L’AMOUR’s theme - “If you’re not born into a family that will love you as-is, build one that does.” -  is as relevant today as it was in the 1980s when the show is set.</p>
<p>With a cast of characters as diverse as the world we live in, OH L’AMOUR is exactly the life-affirming, jubilant and fun show we need right now!  </p>
<p>First performed in 2016 to 300+ guests, screened in London and Erasure authorized in 2017,  additional readings in Chicago (2018) and Los Angeles (2020) plus over 7000 Vimeo views worldwide of the original performance recording …L’AMOUR’s music, characters and humor have kept fans wanting more!</p>
<p>Here’s your chance to join the ever-widening L’AMOUR family and to help it achieve its ultimate goal of a Broadway or West End theatrical run.</p>
<p><strong>What's the show about?</strong></p>
<p>Hideaway Records is where we find Sam at the open of OH L’AMOUR.   It’s 1985, the economy sucks, Reagan has a war on drugs and AIDS is a shadow that looms over every gay man.  Sam’s an aspiring writer and comes from a long line of…under-educated folk who don’t think that’s a respectable living.  Sam’s good; he’s got the acceptance letter to an elite writer’s program at San Francisco State to prove it.  But there is neither money nor support for him at home.  Sam’s only option, should he wish to honor his star that guides him and his warm heart that seeks romance, is to get to San Francisco somehow.</p>
<p>When all his belongings are stolen his first day out, Sam’s newfound friend Savannah offers him solace and a couch.  A smart, street savvy Black woman, Savannah’s no stranger to catastrophe herself, though hers usually come in the form of problematic boyfriends.</p>
<p>Sam immediately meets Bobby, a charismatic DJ who longs for spinning stardom.   Sam is drawn to Bobby like a moth to a flame.  Savannah, meanwhile, meets the one straight employee in the gay bar at which Bobby spins; a white Texas cowboy who spews Southern charm and who might be too good for a girl with brash self-esteem issues.  Beau is key in helping Sam emerge from his cocoon to win over the elusive Bobby, endearing himself to all.</p>
<p>Ignoring warning signs that Bobby might have one foot in their relationship and another in 80s promiscuity, Sam follows Bobby to San Francisco as it luckily coincides with his own dream.  That dream is sidelined, though, by the allure of the city and its nighttime denizens.  Sam’s creative productivity sputters.  Savannah stays behind and her relationship with Beau hits its own turbulence.</p>
<p>Sam and Bobby go sour quickly in the city of free love and limitless self expression.  Bobby’s need for attention and adulation, combined with a side career Sam uncovers, are more than Sam can handle.    </p>
<p>Sam’s new student reading at SF State is the moment he unexpectedly loses Bobby and meets Latinx social worker Gabriel.</p>
<p>The end of Act I finds Sam, alone and despondent, spiraling downwards.  Not even Savannah, who bought a one way ticket to San Francisco, can stop Sam’s descent.  She’s fleeing her own demons; finding herself pregnant after kicking Beau out, worried the child would force Beau to stick around to love the un-loveable…her.  Beau, working odd jobs along the way, is en route to find Savannah.</p>
<p>At the bottom of a spiral, alone on a smoky dance floor, Sam is lifted up by a drag queen (with a ""Hope"" tattoo - a star where the ""O"" should be) and lured to a bright new day.</p>
<p>ACT II starts a year later.</p>
<p>Beau arrives in San Francisco the day Savannah has come to end of her search for Sam, now living at a halfway house called “The Innocents.”  They’ve all survived journeys of hiding and searching - unable to realize that what they require most is the love and support they so rightly deserve from those dearest to them.  Savannah finds the house but is turned away.  Sam hides until she leaves, but Savannah notices Sam’s pale blue Smith Corona typewriter in the corner and knows he’s there.  They’re finally reunited.</p>
<p>Sam and Gabriel, The Innocents house manager, have a relationship akin to a sparring couple in a screwball comedy.   It started the moment that drag queen dropped Sam off on the front steps.  Everyone thinks Sam and Gabriel act like boyfriends, including Bobby who’s still around as the spirit to which Sam confides.  Bobby knows he needs to move on, that Sam’s inability to let go of the past is preventing him from enjoying the now and dreaming of the future again.  Gabriel just might be part of that future.</p>
<p>Beau finally sees Savannah and the son he’s never seen.  They come to discover that they share the same fears and those can be better dealt with as a team.   The unopened letters Beau has been sending Savannah have each included a check from his oil jobs.  Enough money to open the hair salon Savannah has always dreamed of.</p>
<p>Sam and Gabriel’s friendship ends in an argument-ending kiss.  A kiss that means Gabriel will have to resign.  The kiss also signals to Bobby that he can move on; his guilt was keeping him earthbound.  </p>
<p>At an Act-Up fundraiser at Wonderland, Sam discovers Beau has returned and the drag queen who saved Sam's life is revealed.  Sam says good-bye to Bobby.  United as friends and lovers, our leads prepare to love and fight against whatever will come their way.</p>
<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
<p>Should we fall short of goal, we'll adapt this step of OH L’AMOUR to fit within the amount raised.  Although this will not affect physical dividends, it might affect experiential dividends such as pre-show party.   This could also affect if, when and how the show is streamed.</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>Times are challenging right now and we know not everyone can participate financially.  Supporting us on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram is a HUGE help.   If you live in the LA area and can help in other ways, drop us a line!  We’d love to hear from you.</p>

</h3> <p></p>
<p>Rochelle
Perry is a writer/producer.<span>  She’s had a
number of plays produced, but this time it’s a little different… and much more
“ambitious” than any other project she’s produced herself. After reading Lewis Carroll’s <i>Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland</i> and <i>Through the Looking Glass</i>, she was
inspired like nothing’s inspired her in a long time.  Since she loves merging art and theatre, she
thought Wonderland would be the perfect springboard for creativity and imagination.  So she put a call out to writers around the country to submit ten
minute plays based on Carroll’s Alice books, and she and the literary
department chose the eight best plays of the bunch.</span></p>
<p>Having a campaign on Indie Gogo is a
valuable tool for spreading the word about your passion project.<span>  This is not only a dream for the
producers, but a dream for everyone involved. 
There are actors who have expressed they always wanted to play the Cheshire Cat.
There are artists who have said they have always wanted to paint their version of the Red Queen.  Even the costumers
have always wanted to put their spin on dressing the characters.  And now each of them have a chance to do
that.  It’s amazing that one man’s work
could inspire so many to get together and collaborate on such an exciting
project!  For many this has become a way
for artists to express themselves.  It’s
turned into a project much bigger than something anyone ever thought it would
be.  (And who doesn’t love Wonderland?!) </span></p>

</p><p>Wi111ow Theatre presents a physical poem in collaboration with poet Miriam Calleja and featuring live music by Fuzzhoneys. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Trap-ease is made
up of a bite-sized collective, with each member bringing what they love best to
the table. Starting on a zero budget is difficult, but when there’s a good mix
of drive and dedication you know you’re onto something good. </span></p>
<p>Over the last four
months, we’ve been taking care of every little detail from finding a place to
shelter our rehearsals, to designing props in synch to the physicality of the
performance, transcribing poems into script form, finding resources to aid our
concept and so on.</p>
<p>Starting from a
group of poems the script has flourished, and we can’t do this without your
help. The event is to consist of the band Fuzzhoneys to sustain the live performance;
therefore we need a sound system. Appropriate lighting is another crucial part
of any theatre performance. The rental of equipment and professional help are
the most costly parts of the project.</p>
<p>Considering the whole process of planning, collecting and setting this
is a low budget improvised project full of love and hard work. The team
consists of: </p>
<ul>
<li>Alba Florian Viton has a B.A.Hons degree in Theatre
     Studies and is the creator and director &amp; performer of Wi111ow Theatre
     - </li>
<li>Naomi Said is a professional actress, she's been working in
     performance since 2013 and has followed several international acting
     workshops.</li>
<li>Brandon Shaw is a dance professor at the University of Malta
     and the director of Cleave Dance Theatre. </li>
<li>Miriam Calleja is a pharmacist by profession, a foodie and writer by passion. She is about to publish a book of poetry called Pomegranate Heart.</li>
</ul>
<p>Not
familiar with these names? </p>
<p>Check
out the first collaboration of As the Dust Settles - the full performance

<p>Have a look at the

up of a bite-sized collective, with each member bringing what they love best to
the table. Starting on a zero budget is difficult, but when there’s a good mix
of drive and dedication you know you’re onto something good. 
Over the last four
months, we’ve been taking care of every little detail from finding a place to
shelter our rehearsals, to designing props in synch to the physicality of the
performance, transcribing poems into script form, finding resources to aid our
concept and so on.
Starting from a
group of poems the script has flourished, and we can’t do this without your
help. The event is to consist of the band Fuzzhoneys to sustain the live performance;
therefore we need a sound system. Appropriate lighting is another crucial part
of any theatre performance. The rental of equipment and professional help are
the most costly parts of the project.
Considering the whole process of planning, collecting and setting this
is a low budget improvised project full of love and hard work. The team
consists of: 

Alba Florian Viton has a B.A.Hons degree in Theatre
     Studies and is the creator and director & performer of Wi111ow Theatre
     - 
Naomi Said is a professional actress, she's been working in
     performance since 2013 and has followed several international acting
     workshops.
Brandon Shaw is a dance professor at the University of Malta
     and the director of Cleave Dance Theatre. 
Miriam Calleja is a pharmacist by profession, a foodie and writer by passion. She is about to publish a book of poetry called Pomegranate Heart.

<p><b>Hello friends! </b></p><b>
</b><p><b>I’m so happy to share the news that
Lola Lola Dance Theatre is making a short dance film. And to invite you to
become part of our process. </b></p>
<p>We are creating <b><i>Distant Anchors</i></b> in a tight time frame. We began in March,
the shoot is late May and post-production is in June. Afterwards, we'll
submit to festivals worldwide, and host a private screening in NYC
in September. Our brief time frame is an asset for staying focused and motivated,
but is challenging when pursuing traditional funding methods like grants.
<i>That’s why your support is so essential to realizing this production. <br/></i></p><br/><b>
</b><p><b>Here’s how your donation will help:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>$2,800 – Stipends for Performers &amp;

<li>$600 – Set, Costumes, Materials</li>
<li>$1,000 – Production Expenses, Equipment
Rental</li>
<li>$600 –Travel, Catering &amp;
Incidentals</li>
</ul>
<br/><p><b><i>Distant
Anchors</i></b> has been an important departure from my text-based and narrative driven way of working. It has been a return to the body, and to letting
the movement create the narrative. Though it's challenging to work differently, I am  growing from the experience. </p>
<p><i>Distant
Anchors </i>began percolating in my mind when looking at the beach
portraits by photographer Rineke Dijkstra. Her adolescent subjects are  on the
verge of transition – toward adulthood and toward movement. The simplicity of
their awkward poses against the vast blue-grey beachscapes is striking. In the
studio we are exploring embodying her work, which strongly influences the mood
of the film. </p>
<p>We are also working with rigor –
physiologically a sudden shiver, or the stiffening of joints (as in rigor
mortis) as a way to generate movement. Additionally, we are approaching the
process in a rigorous manner, meaning pushing our explorations as far as we can
and working with great detail. <br/></p><p><br/></p>
<p><b>PERKS!</b><br/></p><p>We want you to know how much your
support means to us. Everyone who donates will be thanked on the Lola Lola
Dance Theatre website and on Facebook if you use it. 
</p><p>Other perks include sending you a
postcard from the shoot, a print of a film still from the finished product, a
download of the film, and an invitation for you and a guest to the private
screening in September. </p>
<p>You (or your business) can become a
sponsor for $500 and we will include your name and logo in the credits of the
film. At the $1,000 level you receive a producer credit and a meet &amp; greet
with the performers. </p>
<p><i>We
would like to extend an extra special thank you to Mark Gilbert of Mark’s
Bookkeeping Services &amp; Nobody’s Perfekt Media for his advance commitment to
sponsorship! Your generous support has been a wonderful motivator for this
project. </i></p>

and working with great detail. 
PERKS!We want you to know how much your
support means to us. Everyone who donates will be thanked on the Lola Lola
Dance Theatre website and on Facebook if you use it. 
Other perks include sending you a
postcard from the shoot, a print of a film still from the finished product, a
download of the film, and an invitation for you and a guest to the private
screening in September. 
You (or your business) can become a
sponsor for $500 and we will include your name and logo in the credits of the
film. At the $1,000 level you receive a producer credit and a meet & greet
with the performers. 
We
would like to extend an extra special thank you to Mark Gilbert of Mark’s
Bookkeeping Services & Nobody’s Perfekt Media for his advance commitment to
sponsorship! Your generous support has been a wonderful motivator for this
project. 
Can’t
donate right now? No problem! 


You
can help us by spreading the word about our Indiegogo campaign. You can use the
“share” tools to post to social media 

If
you’re near Westport, CT, where the shoot will take place, we welcome
volunteers for the set up & take down of the set, or help with catering for
the crew. 

Do
you have a fabulous retro (and maybe striped) bathing suit you don’t wear
anymore? Maybe it will work for us as a costume.

Do
you have experience applying to film festivals you can share with us? Are you
great at proofreading?

I’ve been the Creative Director of Lola
Lola Dance Theatre since 2003. The company creates innovative dance theatre
full of striking imagery for traditional and site-specific spaces, as well as
film. We have produced six evening-length performances in New York City and
numerous shorter works that have been seen across the country. I have
participated in artist residencies in the U.S. and France, and have received
funding from the National Endowment for the Arts via Chashama’s Windows
Project. Distant Anchors is a welcome
next step in the company’s trajectory.

The show takes place in 1957 and is about a struggling Broadway playwright named Nathan Wood, who is constantly having his shows taken off Broadway because of - you guessed it - scathing critical reviews. But in a strange turn of fate, the three most powerful theater critics must put on a new musical that has to get good reviews. </i></p>
<p><i>The show will be performed July 23-27 at the glamorous Alice Griffin Jewel Box Theatre at Signature on 480 W. 42nd Street, New York, NY   </i>(see Gallery for pics!) </p>
<p>We are Matt Gurren (Book, Music and Lyrics) and James Campodonico (Music and Lyrics) - the writing team behind <i>What Do Critics Know?</i> Jim and I aren't exactly contemporaries - we have a couple generations between us - but we average out at about 50. All the same, we are kindred spirits who have put nothing but our love and passion for musical theater into this show. Jim's had an extensive career in musical theater studying at the prestigious BMI Workshop and had classmates that included Alan Menken (<i>Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin</i>), Ed Kleban (<i>A Chorus Line</i>), Maury Yeston (<i>Nine</i>). His shows have been presented at Goodspeed, the O'Neill, Luna Stage, York Theatre and many more notable venues. Matt's a playwright with presented works that include ""Appraiser's Desk"", ""Mrs., Widow"", and musicals ""No Lover's Fool"" and ""Last Dance"" and is a member of the Dramatists Guild. </p>
<p>After having a hit staged reading of <i>What Do Critics Know?</i> at off-Broadway's York Theatre Company in November with a stellar, Broadway cast, our show was selected out of hundreds of applicants to be one of ten shows presented as part of the New York Musical Theatre Festival's Next Link Project. This is an amazing opportunity for new writers and their works, giving them exposure to a wider audience and ensuring next steps in the show's development. Many NYMF shows have gone on to Broadway and Off-Broadway (<i>Next To Normal, Chaplin, [Title Of Show], Altar Boyz, Yank!</i> - to name a few) and have won Tony Awards, Drama Desks and the Pulitzer Prize for Drama. With your help, our show could be next!</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need and What You'll Get </h3> <p>While NYMF has provided our Next Link Show with a subsidized production slot (they think it's worth investing in!), a majority of the funding still falls on us writers. With a fully staged show that is a period piece and has a cast of 13 and a 7-piece orchestra  - our current budget stands at $62,000. We aren't going to make back a fraction of those expenses from ticket sales, so we depend on contributions from individuals like you to cover:</p>

The Story</b><br/>It’s the not too-distant future, and the tedium of everyday life is making Mariko restless — until the day she discovers a crate in her attic, filled with vinyl records that her mother collected.

We are ready to GO!It's been because of everyone's support  and constant encouragement in the last two years that we have taken on such an ambitious goal- TO GO TO INDIA! It has been a dream for two years!We can do it BUT we need your help! Furthermore, the group will undertake a research and creation residency in the village of India- working on a new piece, planned to tour in 2016. To perform in Delhi and undertake the residency, we want your support! We dont have a lot of time  and need the financial help to present a beautiful show and if possible, live well too.To do what we love takes a lot BUT we are stubborn artists. We know there is a lot of love in the world and we will take all we can take and hold in our hearts.What your support means to us?Everything!Your help and support would mean that we  will actually have a better place to sleep, sufficient food to eat, rehearse in an okay space and undertake the one-month residency after the performance.Without your support, we will be under a lot of financial pressure.Here is where your money will go:Accommodation (in Delhi and Auroville): 210 EurosTravel: 500 Euros for three actors from France and Norway (we are paying half our fares!)Rehearsal space (in Delhi and Auroville): 100 EurosFood (total food cost in India for the 1.5 months!): 190 EurosWe have raised 1200 Euros (through sponsorships from embassies and private companies, self-funding and in-kind support!)If we don't reach the goal we will still get the amount that has been donated, so partial win, we would have something...)Risks and ChallengesWe are performing in exactly 28 days before the premier work of our company!

<h1><b>LEFT at the Emerge Festival</b></h1>
<p>Neus Gil Cortés has been creating work for several years alongside a successful dance career.  Having danced with numerous choreographers, she is now developing her own artistic style and a repertoire that can be 
performed at festivals and in venues around the world.  <br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I believe in exploring our social
contexts and the reality we are involved in as artists. I often wonder why
contemporary dance is a minority artform when its source (the body) is the most
natural and knowledgeable of tools. I believe dance artists too often make
little effort to allow their work to be understood and that we as dance artists
have a shared responsibility to address that. This is not about underestimating
the intelligence of the audience, but about offering a context so that people
are in the right disposition to perceive or feel what is trying to be
communicated.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Neus has been invited to present a new work, <b>Left</b>, at C-12 Dance Company's Emerge Festival in November 2015, 
alongside new works by Co_Motion Dance, Tamsin Griffiths, Gemma Prangle,
 and What Is Written Dance Company.<b><br/></b></p>
<blockquote><p><b>Left </b>explores self-judgement, self-deprecation, and self-doubt: the 
feeling of being inadequate, and the fear that we are not good enough, 
smart enough, or interesting enough.  <em><strong>Left </strong></em>is a reflection on the power of the psyche to both effect and affect human nature.  <br/></p></blockquote>
<p><br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>Why are we fundraising?
</h3>
<p>We are committed to recognition of the value of professional artists by the awarding of proper and fair payment.</p>
<p>We will be working full-time for three weeks creating <b>Left </b>with two professional 
dancers, and performing every night for a week.  <br/></p>
<p>We have a designer, 
who will want to costume the dancers.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Reaching our target of £2,500 will allow us to pay these people.  <br/></p>
<br/><h3>What's in it for you?</h3> There's a feeling you get when you've helped realise someone's dream. We'll promise you that.  We'll also thank ever donor individually across all of our social media.  Top-level supporters will also become acknowledged Patrons of <b>Left</b>, and get tickets to the show!  <br/><br/>Your support - whether it's £5 or £100 - will make an enormous difference to what we're able to do.  You'll be  supporting the creation of a new work, as well as helping Neus to grow her repertoire and her business as a choreographer.<br/><br/>

alongside new works by Co_Motion Dance, Tamsin Griffiths, Gemma Prangle,
 and What Is Written Dance Company.
Left explores self-judgement, self-deprecation, and self-doubt: the 
feeling of being inadequate, and the fear that we are not good enough, 
smart enough, or interesting enough.  Left is a reflection on the power of the psyche to both effect and affect human nature.  



Why are we fundraising?

We are committed to recognition of the value of professional artists by the awarding of proper and fair payment.
We will be working full-time for three weeks creating Left with two professional 
dancers, and performing every night for a week.  
We have a designer, 
who will want to costume the dancers.



Reaching our target of £2,500 will allow us to pay these people.  
What's in it for you? There's a feeling you get when you've helped realise someone's dream. We'll promise you that.  We'll also thank ever donor individually across all of our social media.  Top-level supporters will also become acknowledged Patrons of Left, and get tickets to the show!  Your support - whether it's £5 or £100 - will make an enormous difference to what we're able to do.  You'll be  supporting the creation of a new work, as well as helping Neus to grow her repertoire and her business as a choreographer.
  Other Ways You Can Help If you can't contribute to this campaign, you can still help us by sharing it with people that you think might be interested - there are some sharing tools on this page.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

What We Need 
 Frolicking Divas would like YOU to help us bring HEATHERS THE MUSICAL to the York Theatre in January 2016.  We have formed an Equity Co-op entitled ""..Gently with a Chainsaw"" Artists' Collective (those of you familiar with the original movie will get the reference - the rest of you will have to see the musical) complete with fresh faces and seasoned professionals to bring you a great show to ring in the new year.  
We have already had some great sponsors come on board:
F As In Frank is our Vintage Clothing Sponsor for the show; and 
The Poster Guy will be providing assistance getting the word out around town with their fabulous postering skills.
What we need now is to raise some money to make this project truly great. 
    Where does the money go? There are a number of things to pay for on this productions and we certainly don't expect to have them all paid for by you, but for those of you that may not be familiar with all that goes in to making a big project like this happen, a few of the costs include:
- venue rental
- venue technicians
- box office, concession and front of house staff at the theatre
- our band 
- our actors
- set design/build
- photography/publicity and marketing
- the play rights 
- insurance, royalties, etc.
    Risks & Challenges It's tricky putting up independent theatre projects.  We all know that producing theatre in Vancouver is not going to make anyone rich.  We do it because we LOVE THEATRE.  It's as simple as that.  We love producing and performing in shows that are relevant, entertaining and enjoyable for audiences, even when the message may not always be the most comfortable one.  Heathers tackles such themes as bulimia, bullying, teen suicide and the werther effect.  We hope to have audiences walking away having not only having had a great time in the theatre but ALSO feeling inspired to talk about some of those  challenging issues that face teens today.  
We have an amazing team assembled and an incredible cast and we can't wait for you to see our show in January.  Tickets will be up for sale next week, but if you contribute to our indiegogo today, you can take advantage of some very special 'perks' as a thank you for helping us bring Heathers to Vancouver including tickets to our show.  As mentioned before - it will be very.
Before Mean Girls, before The Hunger Games - there were the HEATHERS. 
Other Ways You Can Help
 Short on funds but still want to show us your support?  Thank you for that! Please feel free to share, tweet, put on your Facebook wall - we are so grateful for anything you can offer to get us closer to our goal of raising $7050 for our show.",4.0,0,"4 Campaigns

</h3> <p>Hello! I'm Genny Yosco of Sour Grapes Productions. My mother and I both moved up from West Virginia to New York and started a theater company because, unfortunately for us, the arts is our passion. We love acting, writing, directing, producing, even costuming! That being said, we've never had the money to do so (but at this point, we just decided that it <i>needed to be done</i>, because you only live so long, and why waste it being sad and unfulfilled, right?). <br/></p>
<p>My mother had been raising me on her own since I was 2 years old, and she decided to further her education after my dad left in order to get a better career - but that landed us in a massive amount of college debts. She and I have always been so enthusiastic about our theater company, but we've never had the money to make our shows as good as they can be. I mean, we barely have the money to rent a decent amount of rehearsal space, so most of our shows rehearse right out of our apartment living room.<br/></p>If we manage to get any money at all - AT ALL - from this Indiegogo campaign, that would greatly help us out.<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need<br/>
</h3> <p>You might ask yourself ""Well, how much does a show really cost to produce?"" Here's an example of what it's going to cost us just for our Halloween show, <i>Countess Dracula</i>:<br/></p> <ul> <li>Since this show is under an AEA Showcase Code, we needed to buy accident insurance, which cost us a total of $295.<br/>
</li> <li>Royalties for all of the performances came out to $245.<br/>
</li> <li>The performance space (3 shows), tech rehearsals (2 nights in the theater), and audition space (2 days) cost us a total of $947.40.</li>
<li>Costuming, wigs, props, and set pieces have set us back $333.07</li>
<li>Under an AEA Showcase Code, we need to pay the actors a travel stipend, which will total out at $840.</li>
</ul>This comes out to about $2660. Now, not all of our shows are the same. For example, our New Year's Eve show, <i>A Fifth Dimension: An Unauthorized Twilight Zone Parody</i> is an original work (meaning that I wrote it myself) so we don't have to pay the royalties for the show, but that has more people in it, so we're going to have to pay more actors. The show that I wrote that got into the FRIGID Festival, <i>CSI: Mayberry - An Unauthorized Parody</i>, also required no royalties, but it also has more actors, it required cop uniforms, and the festival charges shows that they accept around $750 to be involved.<br/><br/>So while we are super excited for all of this to be happening, we are going to be driven into some <b>serious debt</b> over all of this.<br/><br/>Now, I know what some of you more dubious humans are thinking: <i>What about the ticket sales?</i> First of all, under AEA Showcase Codes, we can only charge up to $18 per ticket (so there is NO CHANCE of us charging any sort of ""Broadway prices,"" as some have put it). Secondly, there's no guarantee that people will come. While we have never had an empty audience, we have also NEVER completely made up our losses via ticket sales. We would love to sell out our theater for every performance, but that isn't our reality just yet.<br/><ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>What You Get<br/>
</h3> <p>Other than <i>the wonderful experience of the theater, </i>you mean? Okay, fine, we get it - you want perks! We totally understand. We have a multitude of options for your viewing pleasure, but here are some highlights:<br/></p> <ul> <li>T-shirts with logos from our three upcoming shows.</li>
<li>Sour Grapes Productions tote bag! Don't just ""go green"" with any old tote bag for your next grocery shopping trip - go PURPLE and GREEN! Save the environment AND help us achieve our theatrical goals!<br/>
</li> <li>Pens that look like lipstick that have our Sour Grapes logo on it (they're cute, we swear)<br/>
</li> <li>Chapstick! <b>Good chapstick.</b> I, personally, am a chapstick snob, and I will tell you right now that this stuff is SO NICE. We have stuff with our production company logo, as well as logos for our shows!</li>
<li>Makeup beauty books! Full sets of makeup, including false eyelashes, in several varieties: Vampire, Enchanted, Diva, and Wicked. Pssst, the Vampire one is my favorite.<br/>
</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>We Love a Good Challenge!<br/>
</h3> <p> We're not in any way saying that these shows aren't going to happen. We've put down payments on theater spaces, we've payed festival acceptance fees, we've fully cast our first show (and have even began casting our second!) - but we know that ""theater people"" are stereotypically flighty. Here's why you should trust us with your donations:<br/></p> <ul> <li>My mother and I each started acting at very young ages, so we're super determined. I myself have been interested in the theater since I was 8 years old, and I have not backed down since. We're both fighters, and we want this company to succeed more than anything.<br/>
</li> <li>I'm not sure if you've really noticed this, but our theater company is called <i>Sour Grapes Productions. </i>You know what the phrase ""sour grapes"" means, right? For those who don't, it basically means that we're bitter. <b>Anything or anyone that tries to get in our way only fuels our hate-fire. </b>We make things happen.</li>
<li>We don't quit on anything - even when we should. Bad relationships? Nah, keep trying. Too much pizza? Too bad, we gotta eat it all. Super late at night and we should have gone to sleep by now? No, we have costumes to make and scripts to write, our bloodshot eyes can match the pizza sauce all over our shirts.<br/>
</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>We know that not everyone can give us money. We ourselves can barely give us money. Here's other ways that you can help us out:<br/></p> <ul> <li>Share our campaigns with your friends! Especially if you know JK Rowling. I don't even need her to donate anything, I just think that she's neat.<br/>

Masaru Higasa, Pepper Proud and Jeff Kimes.Musical collaborators: Chryseph Honeybear and Isaac Cotec.VJ: Tommy NewbreyWhat we need:It is our mission to create a high-quality performance that also supports the local community by creating income for local artists.  All funds raised through the fundraiser will be distributed on a need basis to secure the success and quality of the performance.  Here is a projected budget:Rehearsal Space Rental: $1500Theater $700Dancer Fees:$3000Costumes: $500Musicians: $600Visual Artist and set design : $400Stage Manager: $500Rehearsal Manager:$1000Director/Choreographer: $1500Graphic Designer: $200Photographer: $200Extra Materials $200Total:$10,300We have already raised $4,600!  We need $5700 to reach our goal!The Impact of Your Donation:By contributing to this fundraising effort you are creating an opportunity for self-expression and creativity for many individuals.  Art making is inherently a process of self-development and self-expansion.  Donating to this dancing community supports building a community that is supported by vulnerability and authentic connection.Ron and Michael each bring over a decade of international professional dance experience into the creation of TransformOtion.  They have chosen Portland, OR as their new home and are thrilled to be able to contribute to the thriving communities in the Pacific Northwest. Their mission for the near future is to form a new professional contemporary dance company based in Portland, OR and to continue to offering high-quality educational programming that is rich in content for personal and communal development in the performing arts.Masters of Transition:We believe in the power of the creative process.  We believe that limitations serve us as an evolutionary catalyst, propelling us into unimaginable capacities of creativity.  We believe in the power of the collective and the impact of each individual's contribution in that collective.  We believe in working with the energy that is offered and being in harmony with our highest potential.  We believe in ourselves.  We believe in YOU!  We are LIONS and LIONESSES!  Let us ROAR TOGETHER!!Interested in more ways to contribute?Spread the word!

The play tells the true story of the house in Belgium that became a haven in hell for the British Troops in the trenches of the First World War. This house was run by the chaplain Philip 'Tubby' Clayton on the grounds that all men were created equal and therefore regardless of rank or religious leaning, all would be treated equally in Talbot House (the soldiers went on to refer to the house by the army signaller's code of 'Toc H').</p>
<p>It is a wonderful story that illustrates that in the worst of times, positives can be found and created. After the war this wonderful notion of equality inspired Tubby Clayton to establish the TocH Movement - a network of hostels that eventually spread right across the globe offering comfort, shelter and support to whosever needed it.</p>
<p>Talbot House itself still stands in Poperinge, Belgium and the welcome and ambience of the place still evokes friendship and support. It was a personal visit there that inspired me to pen the play with the desire to educate and illustrate a truly wonderful place and man.</p>

Ruby Red Burlesque is a Las Vegas-inspired pantomime informed by the foundations of traditional burlesque and musical theatre. Ruby Red Burlesque is produced by Concrete Vertigo Productions, an incorporated not-for-profit in Toronto, Canada.

What We Need & What You Get
 We are aiming to fund $15,000 to go towards building the costumes for Ruby Red Burlesque. Designed by up-and-coming fashion designer Blaise Crocker (Opera Atelier, Bustle Clothing, Joseph Mimran and Associates), Ruby Red Burlesque will be a runway minded take on OZ, revolutionizing live performance in the city of Toronto.

    The Impact Having already established critical and commercial success in Vancouver, Canada, Concrete Vertigo Productions' Ruby Red Burlesque will be setting the standard for independent Toronto theatre. Going on record as the biggest independent theatre production this summer in Toronto - spearheaded by the youngest and brightest Canadian talents - Ruby Red Burlesque is ready to strip away the precedents of what it means to be doing theatre on an ""indie"" level.

there! We are Tropical Arts, a Cairns based Theatre Company specialising in
producing unique, collaborative and diverse work. Our main stage production,
""Shakespeare at the Tanks,"" is an annual production now in its
9th year at the heritage-listed Tanks Art Centre.  Classical renditions of
Shakespeare's work is something we are NOT known for, we have always added a new
twist every year from SCI-FI to Tropical Surreal. Our Company's difference does
not stop there however!  Tropical Arts has a close partnership with ARC
Disability Services and more recently, Deaf Services Queensland who have helped
us build a cast TRUELY REFLECTIVE of the community we live in.  People with a disability and the Deaf are only the tip of our diverse community who are onstage, backstage and fully plugged in to the Tropical Arts experience.  <br/></p>

been able to make before. Tropical Arts has such a good message, but it needs
to be heard and seen. Every donation matters, not matter how small... From
little things, big things grow.</p>
<p>Please consider donating to this lovely little project of ours, as a not-for-profit we put every dollar from ticket sales back into the show and we have
little or nothing for stepping up our marketing game, but with this campaign, with your help, we can turn that around :)</p>

<div>
<p>Hi there! We are Cirque Roots, a
grassroots artist collective started in 2011 with a vision to inspire the
community to engage in circus-inspired arts.  We love to co-create in the
community through conscious events, classes, and workshops.  </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i><b>Cirque Roots is a magical place where we let
our imaginations run free.</b></i> </p>
<p>Our classes provide a space for the Tucson
community to participate in circus arts, stay in shape with alternative fitness
and fun, and discover ways that they can get involved with performance art.
 </p>
<p>We also have an active performance crew with a range of
experience in circus, and have been collectively performing over the past six
years.  We've directed and produced three original theatrical productions
and currently have two more big projects in production, one of which is what
this Indiegogo is ALL about! </p>

Hi there! We are Cirque Roots, a
grassroots artist collective started in 2011 with a vision to inspire the
community to engage in circus-inspired arts.  We love to co-create in the
community through conscious events, classes, and workshops.  
Cirque Roots is a magical place where we let
our imaginations run free. 
Our classes provide a space for the Tucson
community to participate in circus arts, stay in shape with alternative fitness
and fun, and discover ways that they can get involved with performance art.
 
We also have an active performance crew with a range of
experience in circus, and have been collectively performing over the past six
years.  We've directed and produced three original theatrical productions
and currently have two more big projects in production, one of which is what
this Indiegogo is ALL about! 
Let me
tell you more...

About Alice OnLine (AOL)
""If you don't know where you are going, any road will get you there""


Honoring the 150th anniversary of Lewis Carroll’s children’s book Alice’s Adventure in Wonderland , Cirque Roots presents Alice On Line (AOL), a theater production scheduled for December 12, 2015 at the Tucson Museum of Art. 


AOL is a satire based on the connection between online social media and the ridiculous world of Wonderland. 


The setting is the Mad Hatter's Tea Party, where Alice is forced to explore the impact of being in a surreal environment and struggles with personal and social identity.  


Each character at the tea party embodies a different personality in wonderland, as would commonly be seen on social media, such as 
(1) the curious & innocent
(2) the paranoid conspiracy theorist  
(3) the creeper 
(4) the consumed consumer
(5) the devils advocate. 


The story is told through high-­flying stilt acrobatics, partner acrobatics, stilt dance, modern hoop dance, shadow screen dance and projection. Along with a live, roaming two­-person band offering additional funky fresh sound effects. 




Why the Indiegogo & Where Your Contributions GoGo

""If I had a world of my own, everything would be nonsense.  Nothing would be what it is, because everything would be what it isn't.""




Well you see, we are here to ask for support from our community.  We love creating works of art for all to enjoy and the stakes (and budget) just got a little higher with this one.  


We have high aspirations for professional lighting and moving, mechanical props. 



THE ESSENTIAL PROP: a magic table, YES! MAGIC!


Without giving too much of the magic away, we’ll just say this: the major turn of events for Alice is when she grows and shrinks in size. This essential and intricate table will allow the illusion of growing and shrinking. 
Sounds exciting, huh?! :)


Okay, you want more…we can tell. 
Well, don’t tell anyone, but, this table will have a shadow screen/projector set up incorporated into it. How will this work you ask... you'll have to come and see it for yourself!  
Most of our perks include tickets to the show.


Aside from our magic table, we'll be contracting a support crew, and of course we’d love to be able to pay the cast for the many hours of practicing, rehearsing, and performing.  *Stay tuned for video updates of their progress!*


This tea party will come to LIFE with your help!!

<p>Alyce Finwall Dance Theater will be presenting a new dance/theater work for the San Francisco International Arts Festival at Fort Mason.  This new work, titled “RUNE” is loosely based off the Norse myth of Ragnarök, which portends many disasters in the human world and is then repopulated by two human survivors.  The piece is not a literal re-creation of the myth; rather, it is an exploration of the emotional elements that make up the story and its subliminal metaphors.  It is an abstracted language, one of mysterious patterns and meanings reflecting the turmoil and anxiety, humor and love in our modern lives.  The piece utilizes spoken word in both Norwegian and English interwoven throughout.  Much of the movement is performed in silence, or to a fantastically avant-garde soundscape by Bay Area musicians “glou glou” (Gretchen Jude and Arjun Mendiratta), and  composition for piano by the Hong Kong based composer Lo Chao.  Performing in “RUNE” are the amazing dancers Kristin Damrow and Ashley Brown.<br/></p>

<p><strong>Art Moves Global Dança Exchange</strong></p>
<p>Dear Art Mover,</p>
<p>I'm a Maine native mother of two adult sons who opened a dance studio in my hometown in 1988 and then purchased the three-story building in 1993. Hundreds of dance classes, rehearsals, performances and festivals later, the building needs some TLC. After the recession and two hip replacements, I had to move into the building and sell my home of 20 years at a loss. I am lucky to be able to walk and dance again, but I have yet to recover financially. It's time to reach beyond my generous family and friends for help.</p>
<p>Properly welcoming and supporting dancers near and far – that is my dream. I have poured my heart and soul into this dream, into this building, and I am grateful that it has in turn fostered the creativity of so many...and now, the many includes a bevy of dancers and choreographers south of the border who are eager to share with our local community, which has brought other blessings to the building – musicians, visual and healing artists. Please help this continue far into the future.</p>
<p>It will cost upwards of $100,000 to do this -- roof and plumbing leaks, electrical and thermal upgrades, general repairs. If you donate to the building, then you will become part of it -- one way or another! Every dollar raised will go into repairing and improving the building and supporting quality exchange for artists who stay here.<br/><br/>Having a concert dance studio in a small town has been no easy task. So many people have studied, created, expressed and discovered themselves here. The positivity is palpable. It is so important that this continues to grow both in our neighborhood and far beyond our borders. Nothing is more important right now than making everlasting connections with people from a culture different than our own. It's how we discover our best selves.<br/><br/>I know that tackling this project will unleash some surprises. After dealing with an old building like this for nearly 30 years, nothing scares me for too long. Here in independent, do-it-yourself Western Maine, we have superb local contractors and skilled and responsible people who value quality. </p>

</h3><p>Next January I will work for a period of three months in “Multicorps Choreography Centre” in <strong>Benin, West Africa</strong>. It is an important dance center in the city of <strong>Cotonou</strong>, striving to establish and develop art exchanges between the local scene and dancers from abroad. I was invited by Marcel Gbeffa, the artistic director of the center, to create a dance project that will explore <strong>movement as a form of intercultural communication</strong>. Intercultural communication occurs when individuals or groups of different linguistic and cultural origins interact. I use movement as a form of a nonverbal communication and an important way to learn and reflect on how one's cultural systems such as language, medicine or technology work in relation to other cultural systems.

Rather than focusing on a specific aesthetic, we will use <strong>common human patterns</strong>, such as walking, jumping, running or rolling. These elements will support children's coordination, body connection, tolerance, curiosity, self-confidence and awareness.

I find it fascinating how children follow their instincts and intuition, displaying directness in exposing feelings and thoughts and wonder how much can we as adult dancers learn from their ways of communicating.

ABOUT THE PROJECT :               
Next January I will work for a period of three months in “Multicorps Choreography Centre” in Benin, West Africa.

I was invited by Marcel Gbeffa, the artistic director of the center, to create a dance project that will explore movement as a form of intercultural communication.

I use movement as a form of a nonverbal communication and an important way to learn and reflect on how one's cultural systems such as language, medicine or technology work in relation to other cultural systems. While working with children and professional dancers from the center, I will discover the rich and inspiring Beninese culture, vodun religion and traditional dance forms, which will become the basis of our exchange.PART I - WORKSHOPS FOR CHILDREN: I will give dance classes to children of various ages and social/economical backgrounds, while learning their traditional movement and music styles. I will then integrate the shared movement language, with Israeli folk dance, partnering skills, improvisation tools and circle dances. Rather than focusing on a specific aesthetic, we will use common human patterns, such as walking, jumping, running or rolling. These elements will support children's coordination, body connection, tolerance, curiosity, self-confidence and awareness. While communicating through movement we can embody our diversities and find a meeting point. I believe that underneath all our cultural and social differences, lies the body and the dance we can create together.PART II - ART RESIDENCY:In the second half of the period I will develop a dance piece in collaboration with professional dancers from the center. The body of work will be based on the material explored in the children’s workshops: partnering and improvisation techniques together with circle/traditional dances. Through this we will investigate the way two or more dancers of different social and cultural backgrounds relate to one another, and offer an alternative path to deal with potential conflicts.

The piece will be presented at “Centre Choréopgraphique Multicorps” at the end of the residency, and in Berlin, in October 2017 (As well as in potential theaters/venues in Benin).  WHY SHOULD YOU SUPPORT THIS PROJECT:
Dance is proven to help children mature physically, emotionally, socially, and cognitively. Therefore I believe each child should be able to access movement activities, regardless of his/her financial abilities.
A cross cultural exchange can develop tolerance, curiosity and awareness of the ‘Other’ on a social, as well as personal level.
Dance has the potential to cultivate an ongoing dialogue which develops a social project through art. The meeting point between my background and the Beninese tradition will enrich my artistic and social work.
Through this exchange I would observe conflicts as opportunities for potential mutual growth, rather than an end point.
 YOUR CONTRIBUTION WILL HELP  FUND:1. Travel and visa costs from Berlin to Benin2. Residency costs at the “Centre Choréopgraphique Multicorps” (studio rental)3.

<p>Michael Allen Harrison and Alan Berg established Harrison-Berg Presents to bring  their award winning musical Soul Harmony to a national audience. Soul Harmony is a transformative musical in the traditon of Showboat, South Pacific and La Cage au Folles. Bringing the classic songs of Deborah, Sonny and the Orioles to life for a new generation. With a score of new award winning songs Soul Harmony takes a deep dive into the racism of its time and resonates profoundly with our own with a shattering and healing true story. </p>
<ul>
<li>We are asking your help in the casting and production costs as we look forward to our first national premier. We believe Soul Harmony is heading straight for its ultimate goal, to entertain with a story that is life changing for the audience and returns Sonny Til to his rightful place in musical history. Both Deborah Chessler and Sonny Til's families have been at the heart of the creation of Soul Harmony. Sonny's grandson De'Sean Dooley portrays Sonny and has his grandfather's musical power. Monica Rodrigues portrayal of Deborah Chessler has been called 'spot-on' by Deborah's daughter Wendy, and historic R&amp;B radio host, and archivist, Charlie Horner. </li>
<li>Help to reach a national audience and support our vision to help heal the world. We believe many will find their own story in Soul Harmony. The show entertains on a theatrically extraordinary level, presents important history and communicates directly to people's heart's and the concerns of today. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Break it down for folks in more detail:</p>
<ul>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul><li>Soul Harmony not only brings to the stage an extraordinary and largely lost story of American history of the Orioles rise to change modern music, but reveals the game changing partnership between a Jewish woman and five great African-American artists. It challenges racism and anti-semitism, as Deborah and the Orioles did. There is no story like this, and you can give it life and power on the stage. Michael Allen Harrison and Alan Berg have a consistent record of musical successes. Between them they have received 15 musical theater awards. Their three shows have all had a powerful impact bringing hope and joy to thousands and they both truly believe Soul Harmony and it's powerful music will deliver an inspiring message for change.</li></ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We are in a process of bringing together our first national production. We have chosen our site carefully and the people at Uptown! Entertainment Alliance in West Chester are very creative and friendly partners. We have developed a 'brain trust' to step forward. Michael Allen Harrison brings extensive experience in major productions, and Alan Berg brings major project management experience. We wrote the show, we believe deeply in it. As does our cast. We need your support to give Soul Harmony a chance to change lives and create an evening that make people understand and believe in the power of theater. </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We invite everyone to share the message of our show, to go to the Uptown Website and buy tickets now, and to let us know if you know people who would like to go and need a ticket.</p>

</div><p> </p></div>","Michael Allen Harrison and Alan Berg established Harrison-Berg Presents to bring  their award winning musical Soul Harmony to a national audience. Soul Harmony is a transformative musical in the traditon of Showboat, South Pacific and La Cage au Folles. Bringing the classic songs of Deborah, Sonny and the Orioles to life for a new generation. With a score of new award winning songs Soul Harmony takes a deep dive into the racism of its time and resonates profoundly with our own with a shattering and healing true story. 

We are asking your help in the casting and production costs as we look forward to our first national premier. We believe Soul Harmony is heading straight for its ultimate goal, to entertain with a story that is life changing for the audience and returns Sonny Til to his rightful place in musical history. Both Deborah Chessler and Sonny Til's families have been at the heart of the creation of Soul Harmony. Sonny's grandson De'Sean Dooley portrays Sonny and has his grandfather's musical power. Monica Rodrigues portrayal of Deborah Chessler has been called 'spot-on' by Deborah's daughter Wendy, and historic R&B radio host, and archivist, Charlie Horner. 
Help to reach a national audience and support our vision to help heal the world. We believe many will find their own story in Soul Harmony. The show entertains on a theatrically extraordinary level, presents important history and communicates directly to people's heart's and the concerns of today.

<p><i>And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!</i></p>
<p>Dan Owenby.  Laura Edwards Root. Gerry Diftler.</p>
<p>If you love Knoxville theatre or have performed on local stages for many years, you have probably worked with and respected one of these wonderful people.</p>
<p>Let me tell you about them.</p>
<p>Dan was the actor's actor. He worked with everyone and always took it upon himself to create social opportunities for the cast, especially out of town actors. He played anything and everything and his sheer joy at being on stage was infectious.  He used to wear a shirt reading 'The Happiest Actor in the World'. And he was.</p>
<p>Laura was, simply, the funniest woman I've ever known. She could turn even the dullest scripts into laugh fests with her off beat line readings and quirky stage presence. Her generosity of spirit and willingness to pitch in meant so much to this theatre, She had stepped away from the stage but I was hoping to lure her back. Laura was serving as a board member of Flying Anvil Theatre when she unexpectedly passed away in 2013. </p>
<p>Gerry is a local legend who was instrumental in getting the first community theatre off the ground. From New York, she brought a new professionalism (and a very sophisticated sense of style) to the area - as an actor, director and producer. A natural raconteuse and impresaria (she would have approved of those words, I think!) Gerry taught us all to think bigger and aspire to more.</p>
<h3>WHAT WE NEED:</h3>
<p>We'd like to do these rooms up right - with first class lighted make up mirrors, plenty of costume hanging space and comfortable chairs. Our green room will be furnished with modern furniture and kitchen equipment. (Actors run on coffee, you know,) We'll add custom designed plaques with info on our honorees. We've budgeted $4000 per room. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>THANK YOU</h3>
<p>Anyone who donates will be invited to take a video tour of the finished spaces on You Tube. We'll post videos of our progress and our dedication ceremony.</p>
<p>Large donors ($500 or more) will be invited to the dedication ceremony, date to be announced later,</p>
<p>If you donate because you know one or more of our honorees, please leave us a story about them in your comments, We'll include them in our dedication ceremony, crediting you.</p>
<p>Funds will go directly to painting, equipping and furnishing the rooms. Any excess will be used to further Flying Anvil Theatre's programming. (Check out flyinganviltheatre.com)</p>
</div><div>
<h3>THE IMPACT</h3>
<p>If you're an Knoxville actor, you know how fragmented the community is and how seldom we get together to reflect on our shared experiences and history. We hope that the plaques on the door of each room remind all of us that we are part of a greater community with a long history - that we are all connected and how we treat one another is our greatest legacy.   </p>
<p>We are so grateful for our beautiful new home at 1300 Rocky Hill Rd and we will do great things there. But we want to imbue each room with meaning. You can help us do that by honoring these wonderful performers.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>If we don't raise a penny, we will still honor Dan, Gerry and Laura by naming these rooms after them.  But we want the spaces to be special, so we hope you'll help however you can.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Please help us get the word out by sharing this campaign. Use the Indiegogo share tools. Tell people about it. And if you would like to host a fundraiser for one of these actors, let us know. We'll help you make it happen.</p>
<p>And remember - we want your stories about Dan, Laura and Gerry. Please share in the comments. </p>
<p>THANK YOU!</p>

Laura was, simply, the funniest woman I've ever known. She could turn even the dullest scripts into laugh fests with her off beat line readings and quirky stage presence. Her generosity of spirit and willingness to pitch in meant so much to this theatre, She had stepped away from the stage but I was hoping to lure her back. Laura was serving as a board member of Flying Anvil Theatre when she unexpectedly passed away in 2013. 
Gerry is a local legend who was instrumental in getting the first community theatre off the ground. From New York, she brought a new professionalism (and a very sophisticated sense of style) to the area - as an actor, director and producer. A natural raconteuse and impresaria (she would have approved of those words, I think!) Gerry taught us all to think bigger and aspire to more.
WHAT WE NEED:
We'd like to do these rooms up right - with first class lighted make up mirrors, plenty of costume hanging space and comfortable chairs. Our green room will be furnished with modern furniture and kitchen equipment. (Actors run on coffee, you know,) We'll add custom designed plaques with info on our honorees. We've budgeted $4000 per room. 

THANK YOU
Anyone who donates will be invited to take a video tour of the finished spaces on You Tube. We'll post videos of our progress and our dedication ceremony.
Large donors ($500 or more) will be invited to the dedication ceremony, date to be announced later,
If you donate because you know one or more of our honorees, please leave us a story about them in your comments, We'll include them in our dedication ceremony, crediting you.
Funds will go directly to painting, equipping and furnishing the rooms. Any excess will be used to further Flying Anvil Theatre's programming. (Check out flyinganviltheatre.com)

THE IMPACT
If you're an Knoxville actor, you know how fragmented the community is and how seldom we get together to reflect on our shared experiences and history. We hope that the plaques on the door of each room remind all of us that we are part of a greater community with a long history - that we are all connected and how we treat one another is our greatest legacy.   
We are so grateful for our beautiful new home at 1300 Rocky Hill Rd and we will do great things there. But we want to imbue each room with meaning. You can help us do that by honoring these wonderful performers.
 

Risks & Challenges
If we don't raise a penny, we will still honor Dan, Gerry and Laura by naming these rooms after them.  But we want the spaces to be special, so we hope you'll help however you can.

Other Ways You Can Help
Please help us get the word out by sharing this campaign. Use the Indiegogo share tools. Tell people about it. And if you would like to host a fundraiser for one of these actors, let us know. We'll help you make it happen.
And remember - we want your stories about Dan, Laura and Gerry. Please share in the comments. 
THANK YOU!

<h3>Who are we and what's The Local?</h3>
<p>We founded Try This At Home Theatre during our third year of study at the University of Sheffield when we had the idea of writing a one hour comedic musical about the internet, entitled 'Character Limit'. The show previewed at 2014 Platform Performance Festival in Sheffield where it won 'Best Act', before heading up to Edinburgh for a ten date run at C Venues, where it received a 5 star review from Broadway Baby.*</p>
<p>At the same time we heard that Dom's local, The Alexandra, had been shut down to be converted into flats. In the following months, we learned more about the shocking rate of UK pub closures as well as the efforts made by some to save their locals, and were inspired to write a new show about community, loss and adapting to change.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>From coaches to venue hire, accommodation to construction of A COLLAPSABLE BAR ON WHEELS!, there are a lot of things to pay for in order to get a show to the Fringe. This run will cost us an arm and a leg but with your help we can put a significant dent in the cost.</p>
<p>And if not for us, do it for the pubs! And if not for the pubs, do it for the perks! That's right, we're offering some adorably drink-themed perks to our backers, ranging from album downloads and signed CDs, right up to free tickets and a signed and bound copy of the script. Not too shabby, eh?</p>

<h3>What's at stake here?</h3>
<p>Not to blow our own slice of cake here but we really think that we've written a good show and we hope that you do too. If you'd like to hear the album we released of the show's music, then there's a link to our Bandcamp page below.** But what we're proudest of is that it has the potential to make people think about their relationship to their community.

<h3>About US:</h3>
<p>Chamacos is an Austin based dance company led by Aurelio Planes and Inna Grudtcina. Aurelio is a Cuban dancer and choreographer who has a several year experience of working with the leading dance companies in Cuba. Inna Grudtcina is a russian dancer and choreographer. She traveled to South Korea, Spain and Israel pursuing her dance career. Aurelio and Inna decided to combine both of their rich dance experience and create a dance company with a unique voice.</p>
<p>For the short period of 8 month the company has presented one full evening-length work, two 10 minute dance piece, a short dance film, and numerous dance videos. A duet from their debut show will be presented at Austin Dance Festival on April, 7th 2018. The company offers classes in Cuban Modern Dance technique mixed with floor work. We offer a platform for physical exploration and vigorous dance training to professional dancers of any backgrounds and nationalities. We are passionate about dance and push ourselves beyond our limits. </p>
<p>We see our mission in getting more people involved in the art of dance by providing original and thought provoking performances. We believe that dance has power to influence minds and lives of people when both technique and genuineness are present.</p>
<h2>About Looking Up:</h2>
<p>We have been in process of our new production,""Looking up"", since February, 2018 with a total of 90 hours of rehearsals. ""Looking up"" is the new collaborative project between Chamacos Dance Company and ProyectoTeatro. This project utilizes Cuban contemporary dance to explore a new vision of the human experience inspired by the apocalypse. Dancers embodying community endure a cruel and visceral confrontation against the four horseman whom have arrived to end life. This timeless physical confrontation pulls us into a space beyond the body, where generational cycles force us to reflect on our role as human beings in society.<br/><br/>This project was created with a musical selection of international icons that span different eras and different time periods. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In order to bring this show to life, the campaign is seeking to raise funds to cover costs spent on production, such as costumes, promotional materials, equipment rental, stage props. What we value the most is our dancers whose hard work, sweat,energy, professionalism and commitment deserve to be financially rewarded.</p>
<h3>Breakdown: Funding</h3>
<p>Dancer stipend: $1500</p>
<p>Rental Equipment: $400</p>
<p>Promotional Campaign: $500</p>

<p>Short Summary</p>
<p>Hello, My name is Anthony Gelsomino and I have been the Artistic Director of Lucky Devil Theater Company since its inception in 1998. I have been making plays and taking chances with LDTC for the past 20 years with over 10 productions.  With a penchant for LGBTQ themes and a soft spot for comedy, LDTC has survived to reinvent itself once again with Provincetown Murder Mystery.</p>
<p>Having fallen in love with Provincetown, MA and eventually purchasing a home there, I wanted to write the ultimate love song to Ptown. With that, Provincetown Murder Mystery was born. A fast paced, joke a minute farce that had all the elements of an LDTC production: drama, drinks, drag queens and decapitation. Who could ask for anything more?</p>
<p>Once written but twice shy, I brought a reading of PMM to the NY stage to see if people, well, thought it was remotely funny. And they did. They chuckled and guffawed with delight. So, with the help of the suprisingly adept Antony Raymond, we took this reading to Provincetown, MA for one night only. We even cast local favorite Liza Lott as Lozenge, the drag queen with a dream of gold. The cast was as follows:</p>
<p>Narrator: Eric Doviak, Danthony: Gene Dante, Bleache: Devin Melillo, Lozenge: Liza Lott, Dimitar: Ben Dawson WATCH IT HERE: <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/anthony.gelsomino/videos/10154988004716073/?lst=634876072%3A634876072%3A1520134981"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.facebook.com/anthony.gelsomino/vide...</a></p>
<p>We filled the Crown &amp; Anchor with eager locals and some drunk tourists, who responded with resounding laughter to the show. We then knew we had to bring it back, off book and on the mark.</p>
<p>One weekend in Tennessee, I asked Lucky Devil Theater Co’s other founding member Von Parish, to do the math on bringing this fully realized show to the stage. She did, and armed with a mimosa, she came up with a budget of $30k. Guess we need to raise some dough.</p>
<p>What We Need &amp; What You Get</p>
<p>Since we are a NY based company, we need to rehearse this show in NYC and bring it to Ptown. That means money. It also means we are going to try and do something people never do: PAY THE ACTORS! So the money we raise will go the following places:</p>
<p>Rehearsal space in a not very glamorous NYC rehearsal space for a week rehearsal period.</p>
<p>Costumes &amp; props. We will admit, one prop is a flying dildo.</p>
<p>Something we will call a set. </p>
<p>Transportation for the actors &amp; crew to/from Ptown. </p>
<p>Housing in Ptown.</p>
<p>A stipend so that crew/actors can eat food each day.</p>
<p>Promotional materials so people know what we are doing.</p>
<p>Cargo charges to get Liza Lott &amp; Gene Dante from MA to NYC for rehearsal.</p>
<p>Technical assistance that helps make theater magic.</p>
<p>We actually need more than the $10,000 we are asking for here. Remember Von’s $30,000 budget? Well, I wanted to be realistic and put a goal that seemed reasonable and didn’t make us look like losers if we didn’t hit it.</p>
<p>I’d like to tell you that you are saving a hungry child from diphtheria or a rescue dog from Cujo-ism..but you are not. Instead you will help us bring something much more needed in the world today: GAY THEATER. LDTC is not making a profit from this production; we will be lucky if we remotely break even. So feel good in knowing every penny we raise is going into making the funniest, most satisfying play about a ghost dildo you’ve ever seen. </p>
<p>So please, if you find any solace in a great night out with irreverent theater, give us a chance to make the children’s laughter remind us how it used to be.</p>

We actually need more than the $10,000 we are asking for here. Remember Von’s $30,000 budget? Well, I wanted to be realistic and put a goal that seemed reasonable and didn’t make us look like losers if we didn’t hit it.
I’d like to tell you that you are saving a hungry child from diphtheria or a rescue dog from Cujo-ism..but you are not. Instead you will help us bring something much more needed in the world today: GAY THEATER. LDTC is not making a profit from this production; we will be lucky if we remotely break even. So feel good in knowing every penny we raise is going into making the funniest, most satisfying play about a ghost dildo you’ve ever seen. 
So please, if you find any solace in a great night out with irreverent theater, give us a chance to make the children’s laughter remind us how it used to be.",6.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Shakespeare and Me </h3>
<p>Do you remember that moment in ""10 Things I Hate About You"" when Kat's best friend says about William Shakespeare, ""We're involved""? I didn't think I was going to prom with him, but I get where she's coming from. I did my first Shakespeare play in fifth grade. It was in the gifted program, and we did a (very abbreviated) version of ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"". I traded Shakespeare quotes with bad boyfriends in undergrad, and I met my husband at an audition for Georgia Shakespeare shortly after getting my BFA. I've performed Shakespeare professionally, and chose my graduate school largely because of UCF's relationship with the Orlando Shakespeare Theater. I've been in Romeo and Juliet 4 times. You get it, I'm a big fan.</p>
<h3><strong>Shakespeare and You</strong></h3>
<p>But what do you think of when you hear the name Shakespeare? I know if you asked my mom, she'd say it conjured memories of tortuous high school reading assignments. She's supportive of my Bard obsession, but there's no love lost between her and Will.</p>
<p>I think a lot of people feel that way. </p>
<p>There are lots of reasons that I've selected this as my thesis project. I can give you the rundown from my abstract about Gender Theory, female representation, subversion of societal roles, but let's be honest, you don't want to read about that. (If you do, let me know and I'll send you drafts along the way as I write!) I think the most important reason for you to know is this: I want to share my love for Shakespeare. I want to make Shakespeare accessible. I want to put on a production that is immediate, easy to understand, and fun. I want you to come see the show and have your mind changed about what Shakespeare can be, and then I want to talk to you about it!</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
</div><div>I have a lot of support from both the University of Central Florida and the Orlando Shakespeare Theater, particularly when it comes to space. They are graciously donating rehearsal and performance space for which I am incredibly grateful!</div><div> </div><div>As both a research project, and a fully mounted production, we do have other expenses that I need your help with.</div><div> </div><div>The $2000 I am seeking to raise is going to the following categories:</div><ul>
<li>Paying technicians and OST staff for their time</li>
<li>Costumes</li>
<li>Set</li>
<li>Marketing </li>
<li>Programs</li>
<li>Research Materials</li>
</ul><p>Your financial support will allow us to have production that looks as great as it sounds! As a token of our gratitude, we will be offering VIP tickets, signed scripts, and thank yous in our programs and in my published thesis.</p><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Less than 16% of Shakespeare's roles were written for women. Opportunities for women to perform his words can be few and far between, but your contribution can help change that.</p>
<ul>
<li>Your support gives women the chance to speak Shakespeare on a professional stage</li>
<li>Your support aids in the continued education of some of Central Florida's brightest minds.</li>
<li>Your support gives opportunities for students to see affordable theatre.</li>
<li>Your support allows me to make an academic contribution to my field. </li>
<li>Your support makes this production possible.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There are always challenges in the theatre, but as we say ""The Show Must Go On"". We are working on a tight budget, and the performers, technicians, and stage managers are all donating their time to the project. I am determined to mount this show regardless of the money we raise here, but every dollar makes it a smoother and more successful road to opening night.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>The biggest way you can help is by coming to our show! The core of this production is research and audience involvement, so the best way you can help is by showing up! </p>
<p>Be on the lookout for a Facebook event as we get closer to the date!</p>
<p>I'm going to be spending the next year and a half talking and writing about women and Shakespeare, so please reach out any time to chat about it! I'm passionate about this work, and I love sharing it with people!</p>

<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>We believe in the power of a good ghost story.</p>
<p><i>Ghosts</i>, an original play by Elford Alley, features everything that attracts people to the paranormal while exploring themes of loss, how we cope with our loved ones, and how past relationships twist to become their own ghost stories.</p>
<p>In 2017, producer Charlotte Corneliusen and director Kathleen Barth teamed up to bring the play to life, The result was the play's original one-act run at the Little Theatre of Alexandria, which opened to rave reviews and sold-out crowds. The team submitted their production to the 2018 Capital Fringe Festival and was accepted-- a big deal!</p>
<p>Now, Charlotte, Kathleen, and Elford are proud to team up again to bring the full-length version of <i>Ghosts </i>to Washington, D.C.</p>
<p><i>About the Team</i></p>
<p>Kathleen Barth is a director active in the D.C. area. As a director, she feels passionate about staging new works and extending opportunities to women artists. She was particularly drawn to Ghosts because of its portrayal of the depths of people in anguish and grief and the dark shades of human nature. Kathleen directed the original one-act version of Ghosts at the Little Theatre of Alexandria's ""Creepshow"", hosted by the NextGen committee, and now she is delighted to direct the new full-length version of Ghosts that will premier this summer at the Capital Fringe Festival.</p>
<p>Charlotte Corneliusen is a creative producer, screenwriter, casting director and production designer, who has lived in the DC area, since 2009. She began her career in film in 1998 and has worked on big-budget documentaries, independent films and television series, in Canada and Germany. She started producing theatre in 2017 and co-produced the one-act version of Ghosts, at Little Theatre of Alexandria, last fall. She loved the original version of the Ghosts script and her experience working with Elford and Kathleen. She is proud to team up with them again to bring a full-length version of the play, with a talented cast and crew, to Capital Fringe in July. Charlotte believes in the story and her team so much that she is self-producing and requests your support as an independent theatre artist.</p>
<p>Elford Alley is a playwright and novelist from Texas. He's always believed in the power of a good ghost story. He's incredibly grateful to Kathleen, Charlotte, and Dennis, not just for choosing his work, but for helping him improve and expand the story in so many wonderful ways.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Your donation will help pay the cast and crew, cover Fringe venue fees and insurance costs, purchase set pieces/props/costumes and provide a marketing budget, so that we can not only put on the best play possible, but also to reach an audience who may not know much about their local theater scene.</p>
<p>To make this production a reality, we have a modest fundraising goal of $1,500. Here's how our budget breaks down:</p>
<ul>
<li>30%: Fringe Fees/Venue</li>
<li>30%: Artist Stipends</li>
<li>15%: Costumes/Set Pieces/Props</li>
<li>12%: Insurance</li>
<li>10%: Marketing/Printing</li>
<li>3%: Transportation</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Our wish to bring <i>Ghosts </i>to the Capital Fringe Festival goes beyond our desire to bring a good ghost story to the stage. We believe in the power of community and keeping the local, independent arts scene thriving by providing a fun, genre piece that appeals to lovers of theater, sci-fi, horror, and mystery.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Help us by getting the word out by sharing this campaign via social media -- It's a tremendously effective, cost-free way to help us grow. </p>
<p>Tell your friends and family about our production. Join us this July at the Blind Whino in Washington, D.C. and experience what we've worked tirelessly on for the past year!</p>

Productions is planning on bringing a production of SNOW to the stage this fall.But in order for us to do that, we need your help.Utilizing a structure similar to THE HOURS and CLOUD ATLAS, SNOW explores the power and nature of storytelling through three disperate storylines that all revolve around the classic fairy tale SNOW WHITE - the Grimm Brothers who originally collected the tales, a Victorian theatrical family whose lives begin to mirror SNOW WHITE, and a modern day young woman living with her abusive mother. SNOW asks whether the things at the heart of our beloved stories - hope in a hopeless world, love that will last forever are really true, or nothing more than ""lies breathed through silver.""Not only will contributions allow us to bring this important work to the stage, the more we are able to raise, the more we will be able to donate to Broadway Cares.",0.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The performers of Guilty Pleasures Cabaret are professional dancers, singers, and comedians who live and work in New York City performing their show every two weeks at renowned cabaret venues.  Many of the performers have international and domestic touring experience, and sought out the need to produce and direct a show that created a positive image of women in show business. </p>
<p>This campaign is important to us because after years of auditioning and being part of shows where we're constantly told what to look like, what to wear, and that we weren't sexy enough, we wanted to create a show that embraced individuality and our unique talents.  </p>
<p>We're growing to a point where we're receiving offers to perform at large domestic and international venues.   These are valuable opportunities to spread our message, share our unique art-form, grow our fanbase, and expand our business. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Funds collected from our campaign will go towards</p>
<ul>
<li>($3,500) Airfare, transportation, and dancer salary for a tour in Belize </li>
<li>($2,250) Airfare &amp; transportation for a tour in Colorado</li>
<li>($2,250) Airfare &amp; transportation for a tour in California</li>
<li>($2,000) Salary for touring dancers</li>
</ul>
<p>Contributor perks include: show tickets, merchandise, and VIP access to GPC Art Bar events.  If we don't reach our entire goal, the collected funds will go towards dancer's salaries for current NYC shows. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Did you know that females only comprise 5% of the CEO's and 7% of show business directors in the nation?  By contributing to this campaign you're personally supporting young female entrepreneurs and producers. </p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Our main source of revenue comes from ticket sales.  Our venues usually take up to 50% of our ticket sales, then after paying performers, costumes, rehearsal space, and marketing materials - many times we're lucky if we break even.  Going on a tour requires a certain amount of money upfront.  As we start expanding our brand to markets outside of NYC, it will be easier for venues to book us and fund the cost of our show entirely.  </p>
<p>We're savvy when it comes to pinching pennies to work with what we do (or don't) have.  We know how to budget our funds, reuse costumes, recycle marketing materials, and work side jobs in exchange for studio space. </p>

<p><strong>Is it too late to become the person you were meant to be?</strong></p>
<p><strong>I’m Ben Hollis, best known for hosting “Wild Chicago” on WTTW. Few of you realize I am also a theater artist and performer who sings and writes songs. I love my TV work. And I am long overdue in showing another side of myself. Surviving a rare brain vessel condition gives me a chance to do so. I am so grateful.</strong></p>
<p><strong>This creative effort takes the form of a solo show (with support from master rocker John Siegle, formerly of the Insiders.) I’m singing songs and telling stories about my life before, during and after “Wild Chicago.” (Including my “Bed of Bosoms” – an ancient, infantile dream I honestly remember from childhood.)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Welcome to ""How The Beatles Nearly Ruined My Life - And David Bowie Saved it!""</strong></p>
<p><strong>The show is about how music saved me, then and now. (I know you can relate.) It’s also a testament to the human spirit and our ability to reinvent ourselves – at any age.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Your contribution will enable me to mount this production which in turn will bring joy and hope and big laughs to all who come see it. But I can’t bankroll the whole thing. Naturally, my surgery and recovery has put a dent in my financial state. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Here’s the Skinny</strong></p>
<p><strong>I need to pay a director, pay for rehearsal time, pay to market the show and to cover other expenses.  Months and months of writing and polishing have gone into this show. We’re going for $9500 or better. </strong></p>
<p><strong>The Perks</strong></p>
<p><strong>I’m excited about The Perks – the benefits you get from contributing.  $48 gets you a ticket to the show. That’s huge. We need to sell out all 140 seats for each performance. Your perk covers the cost of the ticket ($22) and a nice chunk ($26) to our production needs. We thank you.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The $98 perk gets you a seat AND the Ben Hollis &amp; The Resentments CD, “Live Your Life” which features songs from the show and John Siegle on guitar.</strong></p>
<p><strong>There’s even an opportunity to BE IN THE SHOW! And a chance to enjoy a meal together, and a chance to have John and I do a show at your place (or wherever you like), and a chance to get your hands on a rare ""Wild Chicago"" DVD.</strong></p>
<p><strong>You can even get a photo file of your own baby picture (or a loved one’s) on my Bed of Bosoms. That’ll make Grandpa blush, eh? </strong></p>
<p><strong>The Impact </strong></p>
<p><strong> I’m going to get deep here. Deep, as in spiritual. I feel that this show is a calling for me. So many people are going to relate to it and be inspired by it. Even if they aren’t, they’re still going to enjoy the music and the stories and be happily distracted from their problems for a couple of hours. That's not nothing.</strong></p>
<p><strong>For years I undervalued my gifts. I thought the ability to make people laugh and smile was small potatoes, lightweight. Now I know otherwise, mostly thanks to hearing from people like you, especially during my medical adventures. You said I helped you. I was deeply moved. And now I get to give back again. It’s a circle. Lion King stuff.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges </strong></p>
<p><strong>The initial goal is to raise this money and have a great opening weekend at The Skokie Theatre on January 21 and 22. </strong></p>
<p><strong>After that, we set our sights on a successful, long run in a theatre to be named. The show deserves it. Chicago audiences deserve it. But first we have to “crush it” at The Skokie on January 21 and 22.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We need you to tell your friends and share this campaign – and other pertinent info – on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram or other precious bodily fluids. (Think “Dr. Stranglove.)</strong></p>

The following fall, <i>Soft Butter</i> was further developed with generous support by Musical Theatre Factory. <i>Soft Butter</i> is now headed for a very special premiere at Ars Nova, ANT Fest 2018.

It is important to us that queer and trans narratives and experiences not be decided for queer and trans audiences and bodies. </p><h3 style=""text-align: center;""><u>Performance</u></h3><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>""Queer stories and trans stories, like any others, are grounded in experience.

This presentation of<i> Soft Butter</i> marks the first time we will share <i>Soft Butter</i> in full. It's a very exciting premiere for us because the work is actively in process, inviting you, the audience, into that process. We will share a gesture of design, a gesture of the world of the play, and a rockstar cast at Ars Nova, a space which actively cultivates new, risk-taking, challenging, in-process, work that's innovative in both content and form. Just like <i>Soft Butter</i>! </p><h3 style=""text-align: center;""><u>You!</u></h3><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>""<i>Soft Butter</i> invites audiences to taste something new, in which Familiar meets Alien.

This kind of project takes a lot of work from a lot of people and every little bit counts. Every dollar, every share, every visit to this page. In return, we will share our unmelting gratitude, some delicious and fun rewards, as well as a fantastic theatrical experience for all genders. Time and time again we've heard <i>Soft Butter</i> liberates people's need to understand or intellectualize their experience because it hits them in ways they don't expect; it moves them. <i>Soft Butter</i> invites and includes the experiences of those who witness it to be part of its meaning.

They are consummate professionals with an artistry and aesthetic that the <i>Soft Butter</i> team has been looking for. We have also already reserved rehearsal space for a fair number of the rehearsals and have signed up for insurance.

The following fall, Soft Butter was further developed with generous support by Musical Theatre Factory. Soft Butter is now headed for a very special premiere at Ars Nova, ANT Fest 2018. We absolutely can't wait to take on this new challenge and want to invite YOU to help make it possible!Identity""This is an opportunity to get a lot of people in a room together that don't often get to be in a room together. This is a chance to get a lot of people in a room together who are often alone."" - Éamon BoylanSoft Butter celebrates trans, queer, non-binary and gender non-conforming voices and as such, our cast and creative team for this production are trans, queer, non-binary and gender non-conforming theatre makers! Our voices demand more content created by us and for us: produced by us, designed by us, embodied by us. It is important to us that queer and trans narratives and experiences not be decided for queer and trans audiences and bodies. Performance""Queer stories and trans stories, like any others, are grounded in experience. Experience begets experience and experience invites experience."" - Éamon Boylan As theatre makers, our work is most exciting when something is being actively discovered. This presentation of Soft Butter marks the first time we will share Soft Butter in full. It's a very exciting premiere for us because the work is actively in process, inviting you, the audience, into that process. We will share a gesture of design, a gesture of the world of the play, and a rockstar cast at Ars Nova, a space which actively cultivates new, risk-taking, challenging, in-process, work that's innovative in both content and form. Just like Soft Butter! You!""Soft Butter invites audiences to taste something new, in which Familiar meets Alien. It invites them to remember before they assume and to experience before they understand."" - Éamon BoylanTo produce the premiere of Soft Butter this summer, we need your support. Your contribution, whatever the size, would be so valued by our whole company. This kind of project takes a lot of work from a lot of people and every little bit counts. Every dollar, every share, every visit to this page. In return, we will share our unmelting gratitude, some delicious and fun rewards, as well as a fantastic theatrical experience for all genders. Time and time again we've heard Soft Butter liberates people's need to understand or intellectualize their experience because it hits them in ways they don't expect; it moves them. Soft Butter invites and includes the experiences of those who witness it to be part of its meaning. We need you to make Soft Butter possible.Budget and Risks""The body is the pan, the gender is the meal, the pan gets cold, the meal’s still realwe genders hang and hang on and hang on to the body, we hang on after the body diesyou remember this"" - Soft ButterWe are asking for $4600 to cover artists fees for the 22 theatre makers bringing the show to life, rehearsal fees so we have the space to create, designers funds so they can work to create the world of the play, insurance to keep everyone protected, and a contingency fund just in case.  Once we start working, the only major risks for this project are the ones inherent in making any piece of exciting and vital theatre. We've assembled a team of experienced artists with whom we are so excited to collaborate. They are consummate professionals with an artistry and aesthetic that the Soft Butter team has been looking for. We have also already reserved rehearsal space for a fair number of the rehearsals and have signed up for insurance. The biggest risk is that we are not able to raise the money for the show which means we will have to find other ways of funding our work. Other Ways To Help""Every character is a real gender, one of many. Infinite genders exist. The genders in this play intersect and complement one another, but are not representative of the whole gender universe.""-Éamon BoylanOther than donating to our campaign here, there are many other ways you can support Soft Butter. 1. Spread the Message! Tell your friends and family about our campaign, post about us all over the internet, and let the world know that you support Soft Butter!2. Share your Truth! We at Soft Butter recognize the whole universe of gender experiences. Some are singular, some certain multitudes, some are different every day. We invite you to share your truth, using #TodayMyGenderTastesLike, #TodayMyGenderFeelsLike, and #TodayMyGenderLooksLike on social media!3. Engage with Us!

<h2>What Theater Company Are You With?</h2>
<p>This is the number one question our ensemble encounters! And it's the easiest to answer. Drunk Donkey is simply a show devised by an ensemble of three clowns.

<h2>But Why Should I Donate?</h2>
<p>This is the best question! It is our hope that you would consider donating to our campaign to put on this show . One of the biggest expenses when putting on a theater show is renting out a performance space. A large portion of what we collect will go towards simply paying for our performance space, which is already one of the cheapest you can find in the city of Chicago ($2,550 for three weeks to be exact!). If could at least raise $2,550, we'd break our necks!!! We mean-- break even! Our space would be paid for! The remaining $1,000 would go towards paying all of our designers and actors. We believe that just like every profession our there, our artists should be paid for their work. </p>
<p>Our space at Prop Thtr is very unique too! Expect to see some high flying two-highs (standing on one persons shoulders) or maybe even a three-high (standing on two peoples shoulders), as our space has a cat-walk thats only assessable by acrobatic forces. </p>
<p>Not only that, but please consider donating as we are just three young artists taking on the Chicago theater scene. Fists raised to the air we want to be apart of the next surge to create ensemble devised work and that you don't need a certain status to create visceral and poignant work. </p>
