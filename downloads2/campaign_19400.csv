<p>Odradek crawled out from under the basement stairs and what did I see? Brigham Mosley and Jon Wikholm and Ashley-Marie Quijano gathered in an excited huddle.</p>
<p>Ever since Executive Director Jon and Artistic Director Ashley-Marie met Brigham, Odradek Theatre Company has been a huge fan of this awesome young artist. In 2011 we produced a succesful run of his <em>Pretty, Smart, Poetic,</em> a saga about three young women. Then, we heard about his solo, autobiographical piece, <em>Mo[u]rnin'. After.</em> We had to present it to Chicago audiences.</p>
<p>At the same time an undergraduate student at Wabash College named Hezekiah asked for some help with a project designed to acquaint undergraduate students with careers in the arts.</p>
<p>It seemed like a match made in heaven.</p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;""><strong>The Show</strong><br/></span></p>
<p><em>Mo[u]rnin'. After.</em> is a mythic autobiography for the queer prodigal son - a journey to the ancestors and back to the homeland through magic, musicals, and time travel. Dream ballets included.<br/><br/><em>Mo[u]rnin'. After.</em> was created under the Tim Miller Mentorship, a 6 month development process to create new, queer work, made possible by grants from the National Performance Network, Performance Space 122, and Fourth Arts Block. The performance that was created, Oh Whatta Beautiful Mo[u]rnin', premiered at PS122 in June of 2011, it was later produced at La MaMa ETC as part of the FAB Festival.<br/><br/><em>Mo[u]rnin'. After.</em> is the full-length continuation of <em>Oh ‘Whatta Beautiful Mo[u]rnin’ </em>(video above).</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Tour</h3>
<p>Did you know that you can get on an Amtrak train in Penn Station, NYC, and get off in Crawfordsville, Indiana. Brigham thought it sounded like a great idea and has this itch to see the United States close up, so we got him a train ticket and arranged to meet him in Crawfordsville, Indiana, home of Wabash College.</p>
<p>At the College Brigham will participate in a couple of panel discussions, present <em>Mo[u]rnin'. After.</em> and present a workshop on the development of an autobiographical solo piece.</p>
<p>Then, on to Mary's Attic in Chicago's Andersonville neighborhood for two weekends of shows, helped along by local businessnes who have generously agreed to help publicize the event.</p>
<div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We don't have enough money to pay all the bills yet. We'll make some at the door, and we have our regular Sugar Daddies, but that only covers part of the costs. We still need to send Brigham back home to NYC! If we don't send him home, Brigham's partner Zac will be really upset with us! We have other expenses, too. We wish art were free, but it's not. If we don't pay for things like time and materials, shipping and printing, ticketing and space rental, there won't be any art and we know you don't want that.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Who Cares?</h3>
<p>Certainly, Hezekiah at the students at Wabash College care. They get a chance to meet a real artist pretty close to their own age. If fact, they get to meet Brigham and Odradek's leadership team, Jon and Ashley-Marie. This will help them a lot with their career plans and preparation for the [shudder] ""real world.""</p>
<p>Perhaps most importantly, everyone who gets to see Brigham's fantastic mythic autobiography will get to experience the magic of Brigham's theater, his inspiring reminiscence of what it's like to be a young gay man in Southwest Oklahoma, and what a great future gay men and women everywhere can hope to achieve. It's a message about youth, roots and the bright future that young people have planned for the world even in the face of some pretty tough odds.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Your Reward</h3>
<p>We need your cash and aren't offering much in the way of material rewards, just a few trinkets. But you will have the satisfaction of knowing that you have helped Brigham and Odradek spread the message of love and acceptance for everyone. That, alone, should give you some warm fuzzies to sleep with.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>

<p>In 2010, I did an apprenticeship program in improvisation studies with a renowned teacher from the Netherlands and that was the beginning point of my research. In the last 2 years, my work has steadily evolved in this direction, has been presented in India and abroad (refer to my website).</p>
<p>My primary breakthrough has been in the field of creativity and healing. I have been successfully using this work in regular movement classes for adults and children. I have been extensively using this knowledge in my association as an instructor with Shiri Dance Company's program for children called Body Talk.

<div><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><p>Hune Company is a theatrical production company in Houston. We develop expansive productions that explore the inherent poignancy of live performance.</p>
<p>Hune Company is dedicated to making a body of original work that challenges the definition of live performance by investigating basic human interaction.</p>
<p>The Living Room Series is a project that directly speaks to our mission.</p></span></div>
<br/><h3>What is the Living Room Series?</h3> <p></p>
<h3></h3>
<p>The Living Room Series is a series of plays performed in a living room. It is an experiment into the ways in which we receive live entertainment. It is a place where new plays are developed and performed. It is maybe one of the smallest theatre spaces you have ever visited.</p>
<p>This series aims to keep budgets low, space small, and imaginations high, providing an exciting challenge for artists. Some of Houston’s most innovative and talented artists are set to be a part of this first season ensuring the quality of this valuable work in a modest space. The closeness of the action on stage enhances the intimacy of the performances and allows audiences the opportunity to experince a play in a new way.</p>
<p>The Living Room also offers audiences a unique experience in that a small group of about 20 people attends each evening’s performance. Free beer, wine, and other beverages are served before and after the shows, gently encouraging people to talk to each other and hang out. The Living Room is more than just a theatre, it’s a place where people connect.</p>

<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p></p>
<h3><b></b></h3>
<p style=""display: inline !important;""></p>
<h3><b></b></h3>
<p>All funds made from this campaign go directly to funding the physical transition of the living room into the theatre, such as:</p>
<p>-Drapes (to be hung around the perimeter of the space)</p>
<p>-Platforms</p>
<p>-Seating</p>
<p>-Lights </p>
<p>The physical transition of the space can be made for a BARE MINIMUM of $1200.</p>
<p>If we are so fortunate to raise more than $1200, the rest of the money will go to funding sets, props, costumes, marketing, and the concessions that will be free for anyone with a ticket, including you!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Why the Living Room?</h3> <p></p>
<h3></h3>
<p>The aim is to make the performing arts as accessible as possible. In the time of streaming media and entertainment, when we can watch just about anything we want whenever we want in the comfort of our own homes, many of us forgo seeing a play for the next episode of our favorite show on Netflix. Hune Company is interested in the alternative effects of theatre, other than submissive entertainment, because we can sit and watch really amazing shows at home without spending much of anything.</p>
<p>To us, theatre is more about the communal aspect than anything else. There is a magnetic power to a story when the storytellers are live in the room with a group of hungry observers.

</div></div>","Who are we?
Hune Company is a theatrical production company in Houston. We develop expansive productions that explore the inherent poignancy of live performance.
Hune Company is dedicated to making a body of original work that challenges the definition of live performance by investigating basic human interaction.
The Living Room Series is a project that directly speaks to our mission.
What is the Living Room Series? 

The Living Room Series is a series of plays performed in a living room. It is an experiment into the ways in which we receive live entertainment. It is a place where new plays are developed and performed. It is maybe one of the smallest theatre spaces you have ever visited.
This series aims to keep budgets low, space small, and imaginations high, providing an exciting challenge for artists. Some of Houston’s most innovative and talented artists are set to be a part of this first season ensuring the quality of this valuable work in a modest space. The closeness of the action on stage enhances the intimacy of the performances and allows audiences the opportunity to experince a play in a new way.
The Living Room also offers audiences a unique experience in that a small group of about 20 people attends each evening’s performance. Free beer, wine, and other beverages are served before and after the shows, gently encouraging people to talk to each other and hang out. The Living Room is more than just a theatre, it’s a place where people connect.


The Shows
NOT MAD -World PremierJuly 30 - Aug 8
GONE -By Charles Mee Sept 3 - Sept 12
BLACKBIRD -By David Harrower Oct 15 - Oct 24
UP CLOSE -Short Plays by Houston Artists Dec 10 - Dec 12
   
What We Need




All funds made from this campaign go directly to funding the physical transition of the living room into the theatre, such as:
-Drapes (to be hung around the perimeter of the space)
-Platforms
-Seating
-Lights 
The physical transition of the space can be made for a BARE MINIMUM of $1200.
If we are so fortunate to raise more than $1200, the rest of the money will go to funding sets, props, costumes, marketing, and the concessions that will be free for anyone with a ticket, including you!

    Why the Living Room? 

The aim is to make the performing arts as accessible as possible. In the time of streaming media and entertainment, when we can watch just about anything we want whenever we want in the comfort of our own homes, many of us forgo seeing a play for the next episode of our favorite show on Netflix. Hune Company is interested in the alternative effects of theatre, other than submissive entertainment, because we can sit and watch really amazing shows at home without spending much of anything.
To us, theatre is more about the communal aspect than anything else. There is a magnetic power to a story when the storytellers are live in the room with a group of hungry observers. More than observers - participants. When we watch a live performance in the same small room as the actors, we automatically become active participants in the telling of that particular story on that particular night. Making this all happen in the confined comfort of a living room makes everyone in the room part of the story. It makes it accessible.

Through a rich creation process, we have been digging deep on our own and with community members to uncover universal stories of otherness, identity, belonging, and displacement.

How have I othered others?” Stories, ideas, and material generated in these workshops are informing the creation of the new original performance production, set to premiere in May followed by the debut tour throughout the United States.

We are asking for contributions of ANY size to help towards this project.",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>My Story:</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Hello friends (I'm a firm believer there
are no strangers but only friends you haven’t met yet), I'm sure you've heard
the terms starving student and starving actor..... What do you call it when
you're both? I wonder what you call it when you're both?<br/></p>
<p>I am a Newfie turned bluenoser who has
been living in Halifax, NS Canada for the last ten years. While in Halifax I
completed my theatre degree in Acting at Dalhousie University. Last year I
enrolled in the East 15 International Acting School in the two year MFA program
that is located in Loughton, Essex England and I just completed my first year.
The program challenged me and helped me hone my skills in my craft as well innately
changed me as a person.</p>
<p>As I'm sure you can imagine this is an
expensive endeavor. I have taken on student loans, have worked and saved and
bleed my poor parents dry. It is now time to get creative. With one year of
school left I refuse to give up now. I am asking for contributions of any
amount to help me with my final year of school. No amount is too small and no
amount is too large. (LOL!). If you choose to contribute not only will it be
greatly appreciated it will contribute directly to my tuition costs and
therefore my future.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p></p>
<h3>What your contributions will help with:</h3>
<p>My tuition for the year is a little over $20,000 Canadian. Living expenses in the UK is roughtly $15,000-$20,000 a year Canadian. Your contributions will go directly towards my tuition. </p>

Margarita is having a rough time.  She’s unemployed, broke and newly unattached.  She’s on her way to catch a bus to New York City to interview for a menial job she probably won’t get.

<p>On April 6th, there will be a benefit concert held at the 2,000 seat Macky Auditorium on the CU-Boulder campus. </p>
<p>The money raised will go to state of the art</p>

<h3>Magis is headed to the New York International Fringe Festival!!!</h3>
<p>For over a year and a half, we have been developing our original adaptation of <em>Plutus, god of Wealth</em> by the great comedian Aristophanes.  And now the time has come for the world to see it as <em>Occupy</em> <em>Olympus</em>, with original music from internationally acclaimed, <strong>award-winning composer Elizabeth Swados</strong>, and directed by Artistic Director George Drance.</p>
<p>For nearly ten years, Magis has produced a variety of <strong>actor-driven, physically-based theatre productions that explore the human condition.</strong> Deemed ""long on theatrical skill"" and ""thought provoking,"" our original adaptation of C.S. Lewis' novel <em>The Great Divorce</em> has now been produced close to a dozen times at theaters and institutions all over the world.  <strong>The New York Times</strong> has declared us ""...daring to be different"" and also praised our most recent production of <em>Shakuntala and the Ring of Recognition</em> in 2010 as ""imaginatively staged...[with] visually appealing use of elemental stagecraft...""</p>
<p>With a mission that is built on training, teaching and acting, we focus on presenting neglected classics that inspire possibilites in the both the actor and the audience. In this light, staying true to our identity, we honed in on <em>Plutus</em>, <strong>a positively prophetic comedy about wealth, greed, and the disparity between rich and poor.</strong> Sound familiar? That's right, over 2400 years before Wall Street was occupied, Aristophanes was doing his best to expose the system, too.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, <strong>the inequality of wealth in society continues to be an overwhelming issue</strong>.  Bail-outs are merely bandages; so it's up to artists like Aristophanes and Magis Theatre Company to continue to tell stories, ask questions and challenge audiences about a seemingly endless financial inequality that affects people throughout the world. </p>
<p>And so it is with a touch of irony that we ask for your financial support.  Not only will this be a HUGE support in helping us to get this story to the Fringe and to all the people that will attend, but you will be supporting all the artists who dedicated their time, energy, and days off to building this <strong>original, world-premiere production</strong> - actors, musicians, composers, directors, dramaturgs, stage managers and interns.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Taking on the Olympian 1%</h3>
<p><strong>Our goal is $9000</strong>.  Not that insurmountable, right?  Just like the Occupy movements all over the world, all it takes is a little word of mouth.  By spreading the word and sharing this campaign with your friends and family and their friends and family, what starts as a concentrated community of audience spreads and expands and becomes a unified movement.  Every dollar helps and goes right back into the production.  With a little diligence, we will take on Zeus with nothing standing in our way!</p>
<p>Make sure you have a look at our perks.  The more you donate, the more you receive, <strong>including our unique Magis training</strong>, beneficial for everyone, even if you have never set foot on stage.  Whether you donate as a Choregoi or as an Olympian, we are grateful for all your contributions, and every cent will help us mount our charge.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Join the Movement</h3>
Some people just are not able to contribute, but that doesn’t mean you can’t help! Remember this is<em> Occupy Olympus</em>, and <strong>Occupy means action</strong>.  We chose this story not because we want to give you solutions to a problem, but because <strong>we want to promote awareness and encourage change</strong>.  And that is where you come in. </div>
<div> </div>

<p><strong>Thank you for your support from all of us at the Magis Theatre Company!</strong></p>
<p> </p></div>","Magis is headed to the New York International Fringe Festival!!!
For over a year and a half, we have been developing our original adaptation of Plutus, god of Wealth by the great comedian Aristophanes.  And now the time has come for the world to see it as Occupy Olympus, with original music from internationally acclaimed, award-winning composer Elizabeth Swados, and directed by Artistic Director George Drance.
For nearly ten years, Magis has produced a variety of actor-driven, physically-based theatre productions that explore the human condition. Deemed ""long on theatrical skill"" and ""thought provoking,"" our original adaptation of C.S. Lewis' novel The Great Divorce has now been produced close to a dozen times at theaters and institutions all over the world.  The New York Times has declared us ""...daring to be different"" and also praised our most recent production of Shakuntala and the Ring of Recognition in 2010 as ""imaginatively staged...[with] visually appealing use of elemental stagecraft...""
With a mission that is built on training, teaching and acting, we focus on presenting neglected classics that inspire possibilites in the both the actor and the audience. In this light, staying true to our identity, we honed in on Plutus, a positively prophetic comedy about wealth, greed, and the disparity between rich and poor. Sound familiar? That's right, over 2400 years before Wall Street was occupied, Aristophanes was doing his best to expose the system, too.
Unfortunately, the inequality of wealth in society continues to be an overwhelming issue.  Bail-outs are merely bandages; so it's up to artists like Aristophanes and Magis Theatre Company to continue to tell stories, ask questions and challenge audiences about a seemingly endless financial inequality that affects people throughout the world. 
And so it is with a touch of irony that we ask for your financial support.  Not only will this be a HUGE support in helping us to get this story to the Fringe and to all the people that will attend, but you will be supporting all the artists who dedicated their time, energy, and days off to building this original, world-premiere production - actors, musicians, composers, directors, dramaturgs, stage managers and interns.


Taking on the Olympian 1%
Our goal is $9000.  Not that insurmountable, right?  Just like the Occupy movements all over the world, all it takes is a little word of mouth.  By spreading the word and sharing this campaign with your friends and family and their friends and family, what starts as a concentrated community of audience spreads and expands and becomes a unified movement.  Every dollar helps and goes right back into the production.  With a little diligence, we will take on Zeus with nothing standing in our way!
Make sure you have a look at our perks.  The more you donate, the more you receive, including our unique Magis training, beneficial for everyone, even if you have never set foot on stage.  Whether you donate as a Choregoi or as an Olympian, we are grateful for all your contributions, and every cent will help us mount our charge.


Join the Movement
Some people just are not able to contribute, but that doesn’t mean you can’t help! Remember this is Occupy Olympus, and Occupy means action.  We chose this story not because we want to give you solutions to a problem, but because we want to promote awareness and encourage change.  And that is where you come in. 
 
By supporting us you will be supporting action and investigation and possibility. Please, make some noise, make some signs, make some friends and tell them all about our original world premiere production that is headed to the New York City International Fringe Festival!  Share this campaign everywhere - it's really easy to do with Indiegogo's share tools.
And that’s all there is to it.  Oh, and to get a closer look into our process, make sure you have a look at the video above.  It will give you a tangible idea of how we have gone about our process and where we are headed with our story.

</h3>
</div><div>
<p>‘Unsung’ is a project that began development in March 2017, supported by Arts Council England. Producer Alice Barber, Director Elvi Piper, four fantastic actresses and a Technical Director came together with two key aims:</p>
<ul>
<li>To devise a piece of theatre that interrogated in a lively and playful way the underrepresentation of women in history, the theatre, and society at large.</li>
<li>To create four complex and interesting protagonists for the ensemble to get their teeth into.</li>
</ul>
<p>We performed our research to an audience of arts professionals and community members to gather feedback. Ultimately, throughout 2018 we will tour the finished piece around Yorkshire, the North West, and beyond, sharing the incredible stories we’ve uncovered.</p>
<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1498749296/it4jb6rwrq2sl68gezkp.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></h3>
<h3><strong>Our Unsung Heroes: Who Were They?</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Ada Lovelace (1815-1852)</strong>, a talented mathematician who composed the first algorithm for the Analytical Engine. She is hailed as the world’s first computer programmer, and was a visionary by today's standards. </p>
<p><strong>Sophia Jex-Blake (1840 – 1912)</strong>, a medic and the first woman to be permitted to study at a UK university; her pioneering persistence to fight for her right to education paved the way for women today. </p>
<p><strong>Lilian Bailey (1918 – 2015)</strong>, one of the first black women to serve in the British Armed Forces. Despite facing racial prejudice, she enlisted with the Women’s Auxiliary Air Force and soon gained the rank of Acting Corporal. <strong>(Please note: in the initial presentation of ideas, Dorothy Lawrence was the third woman we focussed on. However, our audience feedback concluded that Lilian's story was one to which more people could relate). </strong></p>
<p><strong>Andrea Dunbar (1961 – 1990)</strong>, the Bradford born author of <i>Rita, Sue and Bob Too</i> and <i>The Arbor</i>. Acclaimed as ‘a genius straight from the slums’, she wrote <i>The Arbor</i> as an assignment for GCE English at the age of only 15.</p>
<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1498749327/spde4mxg2dh7el6xl3mt.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></h3>
<h3><strong>What’s Next?</strong></h3>
<p>The next phase of the show’s development is comprised of two key strands:</p>
<ul>
<li>The development of a full script in collaboration with writer Lisa Holdsworth (<i>Midsomer Murders, New Tricks)</i>
</li>
<li>Two weeks’ rehearsal and development activity in October and November hosted by Square Chapel Centre for the Arts in Halifax, culminating in an informal performance to venue programmers from across the region. <strong>All contributors to our campaign, no matter much much or little they donate, will also receive an invitation to this performance, and to all future work-in-progress performances.</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Why We Need Your Support</h3>
<p>The first stage of Unsung’s development was successfully funded by Arts Council England.  We are confident we can make another strong funding bid for this stage, however the project cannot be funded by the Arts Council alone – we need your help, too.</p>
<p>The rehearsal period and creation of the script will go ahead no matter how much we manage to raise. So even if we don’t reach our entire goal, you can be sure that whatever you pledge will go towards paying the creative team fairly for the fantastic work they do.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1498749354/kxlbfcg3yrv2andhuxxa.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3><strong>The Impact: How We’re Going To Change The World</strong></h3>
<p>We want to raise public awareness of our four protagonists’ incredible achievements, and question why figures like these are so absent from what we, as a nation, are taught of our history. We hope this work will take small but meaningful steps towards altering the narrow perspectives that govern the way in which women are regarded today.</p>
<h3><strong>Risks and Challenges</strong></h3>
<p>Trying to create new and original theatre in a tough economic climate is always going to be a challenge; however, we are a group of gutsy, passionate and experienced women who are determined to make this happen. We have had the backing of brilliant cultural institutions like Square Chapel, and Slung Low in Leeds, and have already captured the interest of several other theatre venues – and now we need your support!</p>

Ada Lovelace (1815-1852), a talented mathematician who composed the first algorithm for the Analytical Engine. She is hailed as the world’s first computer programmer, and was a visionary by today's standards. 
Sophia Jex-Blake (1840 – 1912), a medic and the first woman to be permitted to study at a UK university; her pioneering persistence to fight for her right to education paved the way for women today. 
Lilian Bailey (1918 – 2015), one of the first black women to serve in the British Armed Forces. Despite facing racial prejudice, she enlisted with the Women’s Auxiliary Air Force and soon gained the rank of Acting Corporal. (Please note: in the initial presentation of ideas, Dorothy Lawrence was the third woman we focussed on. However, our audience feedback concluded that Lilian's story was one to which more people could relate). 
Andrea Dunbar (1961 – 1990), the Bradford born author of Rita, Sue and Bob Too and The Arbor. Acclaimed as ‘a genius straight from the slums’, she wrote The Arbor as an assignment for GCE English at the age of only 15.

What’s Next?
The next phase of the show’s development is comprised of two key strands:

The development of a full script in collaboration with writer Lisa Holdsworth (Midsomer Murders, New Tricks)

Two weeks’ rehearsal and development activity in October and November hosted by Square Chapel Centre for the Arts in Halifax, culminating in an informal performance to venue programmers from across the region. All contributors to our campaign, no matter much much or little they donate, will also receive an invitation to this performance, and to all future work-in-progress performances.


Why We Need Your Support
The first stage of Unsung’s development was successfully funded by Arts Council England.  We are confident we can make another strong funding bid for this stage, however the project cannot be funded by the Arts Council alone – we need your help, too.
The rehearsal period and creation of the script will go ahead no matter how much we manage to raise. So even if we don’t reach our entire goal, you can be sure that whatever you pledge will go towards paying the creative team fairly for the fantastic work they do.

The Impact: How We’re Going To Change The World
We want to raise public awareness of our four protagonists’ incredible achievements, and question why figures like these are so absent from what we, as a nation, are taught of our history. We hope this work will take small but meaningful steps towards altering the narrow perspectives that govern the way in which women are regarded today.
Risks and Challenges
Trying to create new and original theatre in a tough economic climate is always going to be a challenge; however, we are a group of gutsy, passionate and experienced women who are determined to make this happen. We have had the backing of brilliant cultural institutions like Square Chapel, and Slung Low in Leeds, and have already captured the interest of several other theatre venues – and now we need your support!

<h3><i>“No man is an island entire of itself; every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main,” </i></h3>
<p><strong>-John Donne</strong></p>
<p>Our name reflects our belief that everyone, no matter their gender, is a crucial piece of the continent. We therefore strive to make them “a part of the main.”</p>
<p><strong>As a company, our mission is threefold:</strong></p>
<p>1. To establish spaces where <strong>women theatre artists can come together and create</strong></p>
<p>2. To produce work that reveals the <strong>inner lives of women characters</strong></p>
<p>3. To <strong>forge a new canon of theatre works</strong> by women playwrights.</p>
<p>Part of the Main was started by us, Olivia Munk and Jessica Bickel-Barlow, two emerging theatre makers frustrated by the low percentages of women on creative teams. We decided to address this imbalance by performing work by women, with women technical teams, and majority women casts.</p>
<p>Jessica, who is directing <i>The Squirrel Plays, </i>first came across the piece when she took a screenwriting course with Mia McCullough at Northwestern University. She immediately knew that the witty and darkly comedic tale, which Mia has been adding to since 2005, needed to reach more people. </p>
<p>We first performed <i>Infestation, </i>the first part of <i>The Squirrel Plays, </i>at the Space Theatre in May 2017. We received overwhelmingly positive audience feedback, which inspired us to pursue producing <i>Infestation</i> alongside its companion play, <i>Compensation</i>. When Olivia received her Tier 1 Graduate Entrepreneur Visa in September of 2018 for the formal creation of Part of the Main, the wheels were set in motion: We wanted to bring <i>The Squirrel Plays </i>to the Fringe. </p>
<p>Nearly 10 months later, we've not only secured a venue for <i>The Squirrel Plays </i>on  Edinburgh's famed Royal Mile for the whole month of August, but we've also previewed the piece at the Wandsworth Arts Fringe, where we had sell-out shows and excellent reviews (on the weekend of the Royal Wedding, no less!). Soon, we will tour our piece to Theatre503 for two more previews before bringing our company to the largest arts festival in the world. </p>
<p>We feel honored to have the chance to present a work that deals frankly yet sensitively with reproduction, motherhood, healthcare, and race. Particularly in today's political climate, we believe it is important that we not shy away from social and political issues, but rather address them head on through writing, performance, and production. We're proud that our creative team and the majority of our cast are women, reflecting our ethos of improving the representation of women on stages and in production teams across the UK. </p>

Yup, for real! I participated in a polar science mission, as choreographer-in-residence aboard the icebreaker USCGC Healy. While the scientists drilled holes in the ice sheet, I did my own research. Dancing in vast frozen expanses, I tasted the wind, traced the horizon, whirled to my heart's content and, sure, wiped out a few times. Now, I'm using my polar research to transport the Arctic to the stage in a dance production at the <a href=""http://timelapsedance.com/events/arctic_home/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">JCC Manhattan, June 20-21</a>.</div>
<div>I want to give audiences a visceral connection to a disappearing environment. The program will feature the premiere of <i>Ice Cycle (Phase I)</i>, a dance expressing the dynamism and fragility of the Arctic icescape, which I'm choreographing in collaboration with a team of 12 amazing artists. Alaskan-born composer <a href=""http://matthewburtner.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Matthew Burtner</a>, who's done field recordings in the Arctic (even sub-ice!), is creating stellar music. My company of five talented dancers, all women, will perform. And our costume, lighting and projection designers will expand and transform the choreography so that the scene evokes the icescape itself. </div>
<div>Shipboard, I learned that sea ice has the same composition as human bone. Then it struck me that we're both highly <span>endangered creatures. My aim is to use this show to engage audiences around the issue of climate change. So, in conjunction with the performances, I'm programming two climate-themed panel discussions and a kids climate workshop. </span>

There She Danced

Last spring, I got to dance on Arctic sea ice. Yup, for real! I participated in a polar science mission, as choreographer-in-residence aboard the icebreaker USCGC Healy. While the scientists drilled holes in the ice sheet, I did my own research. Dancing in vast frozen expanses, I tasted the wind, traced the horizon, whirled to my heart's content and, sure, wiped out a few times. Now, I'm using my polar research to transport the Arctic to the stage in a dance production at the JCC Manhattan, June 20-21.
I want to give audiences a visceral connection to a disappearing environment. The program will feature the premiere of Ice Cycle (Phase I), a dance expressing the dynamism and fragility of the Arctic icescape, which I'm choreographing in collaboration with a team of 12 amazing artists. Alaskan-born composer Matthew Burtner, who's done field recordings in the Arctic (even sub-ice!), is creating stellar music. My company of five talented dancers, all women, will perform. And our costume, lighting and projection designers will expand and transform the choreography so that the scene evokes the icescape itself. 
Shipboard, I learned that sea ice has the same composition as human bone. Then it struck me that we're both highly endangered creatures. My aim is to use this show to engage audiences around the issue of climate change. So, in conjunction with the performances, I'm programming two climate-themed panel discussions and a kids climate workshop.

We have been chosen as a Boston Center for the Arts' new Resident Performing Arts Company, or ""ResCo""! This wonderful opportunity provides us with mentorship from established Boston companies and artists, help with marketing, and discounted performance space for the next three years! We are honored to be a part of such a prestigious group, and have worked hard in and out of the theatre for the last few years to get here. </p><p>In order to make our mark as a ResCo, Anthem Theatre Company has decided Season 2016 should be spent sharing some of our favorite works with Boston, in our aptly titled SEASON 2016: FAVORITES! </p><p>THE DARE PROJECT: BOSTON, September 15-17, 2016--Anthem introduces New York's ""The Dare Project"" to Boston Center for the Arts. This ten-minute play festival, co-created by Bryn Boice with taxdeductible theatre company in 2006, is a unique way to engage our growing Boston audience; seven playwrights are DARED to write plays based on audience suggestions.

This trip to Illyria follows the plot of Twelfth Night until, quite literally, all hell breaks loose. Bryn and Mike are still laughing about the production they saw in the East Village nine years ago, so it definitely belongs in our season of FAVORITES. Featuring a cast of 15 Boston artists, including Johnny Kinsman as Sir Toby Belch, and Bryn Boice as our fearless, blood-soaked director, this twist on a classic is bound to go down in Boston history as the best Halloween adventure ever.</p><p></p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><div>Anthem Theatre Company's last fundraising campaign in 2013 had incredible impact. We got creative and stretched your generous funding for three years; your support helped us to produce FOUR plays and to win this residency!

<ul>
<li>We are seeking $6,500 to offset our costs for rehearsal and performance space, artists' fees, promotional costs, insurance, and technical &amp; design elements.

<li>THE DARE PROJECT is a community builder. People who are new-to-theatre or theatre-skeptics absolutely love this project because it's fresh, it's new, and you have the chance to commission a play based on an idea in your head! Audiences from each of the ResCos will join us, and we will introduce ourselves to each others' fans, creating a larger web of art seekers and an expanded audience. This new venture is in tune with our mission and can have an impact on all seven small companies. This kind of good will is priceless, as we believe theatre is not a competitive sport, but an art form to be shared.</li>
<li>12TH NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD is more than a catchy title, it's a holiday show. Halloween is a time for adult fun, too, and we want to put on this theatrical comedy event to draw new, curious audiences to Anthem Theatre Company. This piece showcases our strengths: physical comedy, word play, and showing off Shakespeare's limitless possibilities to a modern, fun-seeking audience. 12NOTLD also has many technical elements that we are excited about building, inventing and exploring, the cost of which your donations will help to offset.</li>

<p><b><i>Make Our 'Orchestra' Grow<br/></i></b></p>
<p>We at Savoyards
Musical Theatre Ltd. have launched this campaign to fund our upcoming
production of <i>Leonard Bernstein's Candide</i>,
September 16-18 2016, at the Hangar Theatre in Ithaca, New York. We strive to raise
$3,000 by closing night to offset the cost of paying the players in the show’s thirteen-piece orchestra.<br/></p>
<i>Candide</i> marks a big step forward for our
company and a return to our presenting fully staged and fully scored comic operas
and musicals in public venues outside Cornell University. For the past five years, all of our
Gilbert &amp; Sullivan performances at the Cornell Schwartz Center have been only
with piano accompaniment.<br/><br/><p>Hiring an
orchestra has improved the quality of our production, but also has increased our
budget tremendously. This additional expense, however, is necessary. We could not do
justice to Leonard Bernstein's beautiful and intricate score without a full orchestra. We continue to strive to entertain, challenge and move our audiences.<br/></p>
<p><b><i>About Our Show</i></b></p>
<p>Based on
Voltaire’s satire on mindless optimism, Leonard Bernstein’s <i>Candide</i> is one of the most beautiful and
energetic musicals ever composed for Broadway, a frothy blend of the American popular
and European classical traditions. </p>
<p>“There can
be no doubt about the brilliance of Bernstein’s score,” says conductor Marin
Alsop, “which he conceived as a Valentine’s card to European music. Few
composers could construct a score where European dance forms like the gavotte,
waltz and polka are interwoven seamlessly with bel canto arias, Gilbert and
Sullivan-style comedy, allusions to Strauss and Offenbach, flashes of grand
opera, and Bernstein’s own ‘Jewish tango.’”</p>
<p>This
effect is possible because of Bernstein’s rich orchestration. Our version of <i>Candide</i> (the 1974 Chelsea edition) calls
for violin, viola, cello, bass, flute, recorder, oboe, regular and bass clarinets,
bassoon, trumpet, trombone, flugelhorn, soprano sax, piano, electric keyboard,
and percussion.</p>
<b><i>Our Musicians</i></b>
<p>Fortunately,
we have hired talented young musicians to bring Bernstein’s score to life. Many
are Ithaca College students looking toward full-time careers. Your sponsorship
will provide them with invaluable professional experience and will allow them
to give back to the Ithaca community. <br/></p>
<p>Leading
this group is Keehun Nam, who has come from Vanderbilt University to join
Ithaca College’s master’s program in orchestral conducting. He and music
director Katrina Kuka, a graduate of Ithaca College School of Music, are
featured on this campaign’s promotional video, which also includes footage from
a music rehearsal. <br/></p>

The showcase is produced by director and playwright Emilio Rodriguez, and producer and director Sam White.</p>
<p>Contributions to this campaign support the actors and playwrights participating in the fall showcase. </p>
<p>The showcase includes six (6) ten-minute plays at The Charles H. Wright Museum in the General Motors Theatre. </p>
<p>Showcase itinerary:</p>
<p>2:30 p.m. to 3 p.m. -- VIP reception</p>
<p>3 p.m. to 4 p.m. -- presentation of six plays</p>
<p>4 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. -- Talback (Q and A with audience, cast and crew)</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>We need $2000 to provide our artists with a stipend. </p>
<p>The remainder of the budget will be used to support a workshop, following the showcase in early November 2016, taught by Emilio Rodriguez and Sam White. An additional workshop will take place at Denby High School in Detroit, led by Emilio Rodriguez and Morgan Breon. </p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>The showcase will highlight stories written by playwrights of color as well as give black and brown artists in the area a chance to gain experience and share their talents with the support of their community and its allies. The hope is to create a more level playing field this season with more representation in theatre. </p>

</div></div>","Summary Black and Brown Theatre is a grassroots project that will kick off in October 2016 to introduce new works by people of color. The showcase is produced by director and playwright Emilio Rodriguez, and producer and director Sam White.
Contributions to this campaign support the actors and playwrights participating in the fall showcase. 
The showcase includes six (6) ten-minute plays at The Charles H. Wright Museum in the General Motors Theatre. 
Showcase itinerary:
2:30 p.m. to 3 p.m. -- VIP reception
3 p.m. to 4 p.m. -- presentation of six plays
4 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. -- Talback (Q and A with audience, cast and crew)   What We Need & What You Get We need $2000 to provide our artists with a stipend. 
The remainder of the budget will be used to support a workshop, following the showcase in early November 2016, taught by Emilio Rodriguez and Sam White. An additional workshop will take place at Denby High School in Detroit, led by Emilio Rodriguez and Morgan Breon. 
    The Impact The showcase will highlight stories written by playwrights of color as well as give black and brown artists in the area a chance to gain experience and share their talents with the support of their community and its allies. The hope is to create a more level playing field this season with more representation in theatre. 
    Risks & Challenges Our goal is to fail. We are hoping that this is the beginning of work by Black and Brown Theatre that will lead to more equitable theatre in our area. 
We hope that we will be able to give more artists a platform to be seen, cast and supported in other theatres around the state. This will eventually lead to more equitable casting and B and B will no longer be needed.    Other Ways You Can Help Please like us on Facebook and Twitter, support the showcase and if you are interested in learning more about the theatre company, email us directly at blackandbrowntheatre@gmail.com",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Erika Rethorn portrays the woman's 'Partner', Patricia Hawkridge portrays the woman's 'Mother', and Siobhan LaPorte-Cauley portrays the woman's 'Therapist', each exploring how this particular loss effects these dynamic and interpersonal relationships.The ESCAPE ensemble have collectively taken the time to delve into these characters authentic voices, creating piece by piece the aspects of their lives that feel important to express their individual truths. ""We have found that it is a very different process devising from a theme or concept verses jumping off of a specific source material that we are working to adapt or re-imagine,"" says Artistic Director, Kira Hawkridge. ""This story and its characters are all our own. It was important to us as a collaborative ensemble to give this piece room to breathe, grow, and evolve authentically and organically. As our first true 'World Premiere', ESCAPE called upon an expansive time frame to allow it to truly thrive, and Season 6 was the perfect opportunity to make that a reality.""So where does a piece focused on grief and loss fit within a Season of ""unreality""? ""What feels more surreal than the loss of a loved one? What changes our reality more than experiencing grief? This piece strives to offer a window into one woman's experience, creating a safe space to engage with the difficult subject matter this piece presents.""ESCAPE is OUT LOUD's second installment in their upcoming 3-Part Series premiering this June, all part of OUT LOUD's Season 6: Seeing is Believing (An Exploration of Fantasy & Unreality).DREAMDREAM is a wild & immersive experience through a fantastical dreamscape full of magic, mischief, and love - based on William Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream. ""All 3 productions this Season begin with establishing a sense of 'reality' as we know it,"" says Artistic Director, Kira Hawkridge, ""And from that 'reality' all 3 productions tip into a sense of 'unreality' in which we experience vastly different interpretations of these fantastical realms. These adventures and raw experiences somehow find their way back to the beginning - allowing for a shift in what we originally felt or were aware of. 'Unreality' has the ability to create a change in 'reality' and vice versa.DREAM begins its journey in Athens - in a state of hyper realism. Our Royals, Lovers, and Mechanicals exist in Athen's very ""real"" world - with hard edges that seem to glimmer with possibilities just beyond their reach. As each individual enters the ""the forest"", we collectively unveil, and in turn fully experience, the array of possibilities 'unreality' has to offer, and how this fantastical dreamscape reveals truths within ourselves and within our perception of the world around us. Season 6 is an opportunity for our ensemble to give over completely to the essence of these expansive themes - ""WONDER"", ""ESCAPE"", and ""DREAM"" - and to explore these worlds with open minds and open hearts - reality and unreality alike. Seeing is Believing, and with Season 6, there is a whole lot to see."" ​DREAM is OUT LOUD's third and final installment in their upcoming 3-Part Series premiering this June, all part of OUT LOUD's Season 6: Seeing is Believing (An Exploration of Fantasy & Unreality). ""Season 6: Seeing is Believing (An Exploration of Fantasy & Unreality) begins a new chapter for OUT LOUD Theatre,"" says Artistic Director, Kira Hawkridge. ""We have evolved and continued to learn throughout our first 5 years in existence and Season 6 is a culmination of the fundamental themes that make OUT LOUD unique. Rooted in imagination and exploration, Season 6 is a celebration of each OUT LOUD ensemble member's authentic vision and voice as we take this leap into a brand new adventure together. With a heavy emphasis on core ensemble work, devised material, and community engagement, Season 6 is sure to be one of our most exciting Seasons to date."" LIKE US ON FACEBOOKFOLLOW US ON INSTAGRAM CHECK OUT OUR WEBSITE",7.0,0,"7 Campaigns

<p>We are seeking support for a workshop of our upcoming production of <i>The Gap</i> by Makaela Shealy. The production will be directed by Maggie Monahan and produced by Janie Dickerson and Lizzy Jarrett.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>About <i>The Gap</i>
</h3>
<p><i>The Gap</i> follows a cheerleading team in a small town in the South, newly given the opportunity to redeem themselves at State. When the co-captain makes it her mission to get the racist school mascot removed, her peers challenge her commitment to “change.” Biting, heightened realism is punctuated by expressive poetry, dreams, and dialogue with the audience. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1577394008/ssbaa9zzjwecpfpcmrck.jpg"" src=""""/><br/><i>Makaela as a cheerleader at Gilbert High</i></p>
<p>It is for womxn or genderqueer actors. At Gilbert High, the cheerleaders are not the highest on the food chain. They are athletic misfits. These are not the kids who grow up with schedules, tutors and education laid out for them, but they are hardworking, fast, and scrappy. Most live in trailers and have afterschool jobs to pay for things they actually need or need to survive high school (a phone, rainbow flip flops). Most are operating at or below the poverty line. Most will try to leave this town and fail. They know that.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Workshop Budget</h3>
<p>We are hoping to develop this play through a week-long workshop in February 2020 so we can be ready for full production in 2021. The workshop will end with a presentation for potential investors and mentors for the artists. Since this will not be a ticketed event, we are relying on the support from our friends and family to make this happen. Here is a breakdown of the costs involved (feel free to email Janie &amp; Lizzy for more details at thegapplay@gmail.com):</p>
<ul>
<li>Presentation Space:  For our presentation, we need a space that is clean, safe, and professional. We anticipate it will cost <strong>$2,000</strong> for four hours in such a space.</li>
<li>Rehearsal Space: To keep costs low, we will rehearse in a studio. A studio that can accommodate 20 artists will cost $45 per hour.  For 26 hours of rehearsal, this will cost <strong>$1,170</strong>.</li>
<li>Artists: We believe in supporting and compensating our artists fairly for their time.  For 14 actors, a director, a writer, and a stage manager, we are budgeting <strong>$1,200</strong>.</li>
<li>Printing and contingency: <strong>$200 </strong>for printing scripts and <strong>$102</strong> (3% of the budget) for extraneous costs.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>TOTAL BUDGET: $4,672</strong></p>

</div></div>","We are seeking support for a workshop of our upcoming production of The Gap by Makaela Shealy. The production will be directed by Maggie Monahan and produced by Janie Dickerson and Lizzy Jarrett.
 
About The Gap

The Gap follows a cheerleading team in a small town in the South, newly given the opportunity to redeem themselves at State. When the co-captain makes it her mission to get the racist school mascot removed, her peers challenge her commitment to “change.” Biting, heightened realism is punctuated by expressive poetry, dreams, and dialogue with the audience. 
Makaela as a cheerleader at Gilbert High
It is for womxn or genderqueer actors. At Gilbert High, the cheerleaders are not the highest on the food chain. They are athletic misfits. These are not the kids who grow up with schedules, tutors and education laid out for them, but they are hardworking, fast, and scrappy. Most live in trailers and have afterschool jobs to pay for things they actually need or need to survive high school (a phone, rainbow flip flops). Most are operating at or below the poverty line. Most will try to leave this town and fail. They know that.
 

Workshop Budget
We are hoping to develop this play through a week-long workshop in February 2020 so we can be ready for full production in 2021. The workshop will end with a presentation for potential investors and mentors for the artists. Since this will not be a ticketed event, we are relying on the support from our friends and family to make this happen. Here is a breakdown of the costs involved (feel free to email Janie & Lizzy for more details at thegapplay@gmail.com):

Presentation Space:  For our presentation, we need a space that is clean, safe, and professional. We anticipate it will cost $2,000 for four hours in such a space.
Rehearsal Space: To keep costs low, we will rehearse in a studio. A studio that can accommodate 20 artists will cost $45 per hour.  For 26 hours of rehearsal, this will cost $1,170.
Artists: We believe in supporting and compensating our artists fairly for their time.  For 14 actors, a director, a writer, and a stage manager, we are budgeting $1,200.
Printing and contingency: $200 for printing scripts and $102 (3% of the budget) for extraneous costs.

TOTAL BUDGET: $4,672

<div>
<strong></strong> </div>
<div>My name is LaKeisha S. Cox and I'm from Madison, Illinois. I am currently a student at Howard University majoring in Theatre Arts (Acting Concentration). Anyone who knows me knows I love to be on the stage, whether it was dancing or acting. There wasn't many opportunites to study dance where I'm from, but that never stopped me. I taught myself Hip Hop by revamping music videos from my favorite dancers, such as Michael &amp; Janet Jackson, Aaliyah, Ciara, etc. I also choreographed my school's pep rally dances because we didn't have a Drama or Dance program. I first fell in love with the story of dance. It always spoke what I couldn't express or was too afraid to explain. Now, since study Theatre and Dance at Howard, I fell in love with the discipline and art of dance.</div>
<div>I have recently been selected to train at the Debbie Allen Dance Academy Summer Intensive 2012. I am so honored to have the opportunity to finally study technical dance at the Debbie Allen Dance Academy.</div>

<div><strong>The Impact  </strong></div>

<div>As an performer, I consider myself a griot; a storyteller. Dance has inspired me in a way that I want to share with the world. Dance isn't just about the height of an extension. If executed right it can change lives. I always believed that the people who control the images viewed by the masses controls their self-esteem. I remembering growing up I wanted to be like the people I saw on tv. I wanted to be as confident, as beautiful, as loved, as successful. What was even more motivating was seeing those same artists create a positive image that I could want to emulate. So, I say in confidence, ""The Arts has changed my life"". I strive to continue to project positive images for the next generation of successful leaders in any endeavors they choose to pursue.  </div></div>","My Story

We've done our due diligence and numbers don't lie. Each show, on average, will cost approximately $10,000. That's $90,000. Nationally, at best, theaters can raise only about 50 percent of their operating budget through ticket sales and sponsorships. That's how we came to our $45,000 goal. Here are just some typical line items from our first season consisting of Turtles by John Greiner-Ferris, From The Deep by Cassie M. Seinuk, and Three by Emily Kaye Lazzaro:

Stipends: $12,000.00

The combined cost of theater rental: $9,450.00
Printing and postage: $1,500.00
Insurance: approx. $1,500.00
Costumes: $1,500.00
Box office set up fees: $450.00
This list doesn't include costs like props, building material for sets, gels for the lights, and additional lights or sound equipment not supplied by the theater. While we give our time and expertise freely, there are fixed yearly administrative costs of running Boston Public Works such as:
Professional membership to groups like Fractured Atlas and StageSource: $200.00
Website, including hosting, email, & domain: $200.00
We Will Pay Our ArtistsAnd a big, important line item for us will be stipends for all the artists. Non-union theater artists in Boston normally work for a pittance, or even nothing at all. So, along with paying for all the necessities of theater, it's important to us to add one major expense: A generous stipend for every artist who works on our productions. It will attract serious talent to our company. While it won't be a livable wage, it will be a step in that direction. It's time the era of free artistic labor goes by the wayside. It's the right and fair thing to do.We Don't Have A Plan BFailure is not an option. Playwriting is what we live and die for. Each playwright will act as her or his own artistic director, making Boston Public Works the only theater in Boston where your experience will consist of a multitude of voices. Think of Forrest Gump's box of chocolates, only with Boston Public Works, you'll know what to expect. Just in our first season you will see:

John's passion for defending the little guy and bringing parity and diversity to Boston stages with Turtles


Cassie's dedication to explore untold stories of captive people in the From The Deep, including Israeli issues and questions of identity


Emily's interest in the value of women on stage and of young womens' stories, and finding humor in the darkness of human suffering in Three. 


How You Can HelpWe've taken up the torch to create more slots for new work and pave the way for other playwrights to do the same in Boston. We're taking on a huge project, but with your help it's very much within reach. You can help us by:
Making a donation. Every little bit helps, even a few dollars.
Spreading the word. Tell your friends, family, and especially that person you know who drives the Mercedes.
Seeing our plays. You'll be part of a movement that's changing the way new theatrical work is done in Boston. 
Thank you. All the Ps, at Boston Public Works(P1 - P9) John Greiner-Ferris, Cassie M. Seinuk, Emily Kaye Lazzaro, Jess Foster, Phil Berman, Kevin Mullins, Jim Dalglish, Barbara Blumenthal-Erhrlich, Laura Neubauer",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

</h3>
<p>M<span class=""small-caps"">ark Antony, one of the three
rulers</span> of the Roman Empire, spends his time in Egypt,
living a life of decadence and conducting an affair with the country's
beautiful queen, Cleopatra. When a message arrives informing him
that his wife, Fulvia, is dead and that Pompey is raising an army
to rebel against the triumvirate, Antony decides to return to Rome.
In Antony's absence, Octavius Caesar and Lepidus, his fellow triumvirs,
worry about Pompey's increasing strength. Caesar condemns Antony
for neglecting his duties as a statesman and military officer in
order to live a decadent life by Cleopatra's side.</p>
<div class=""floatingad"">
<div align=""center"">
</div>
</div>
<p>	The news of his wife's death and imminent battle pricks
Antony's sense of duty, and he feels compelled to return to Rome.
Upon his arrival, he and Caesar quarrel, while Lepidus ineffectually
tries to make peace. Realizing that an alliance is necessary to
defeat Pompey, Antony and Caesar agree that Antony will marry Caesar's sister,
Octavia, who will solidify their loyalty to one another. Enobarbus,
Antony's closest friend, predicts to Caesar's men that, despite
the marriage, Antony will surely return to Cleopatra.</p>
<p>	In Egypt, Cleopatra learns of Antony's marriage and flies
into a jealous rage. However, when a messenger delivers word that
Octavia is plain and unimpressive, Cleopatra becomes confident that
she will win Antony back. The triumvirs meet Pompey and settle their differences
without going to battle. Pompey agrees to keep peace in exchange
for rule over Sicily and Sardinia. That evening, the four men drink
to celebrate their truce. One of Pompey's soldiers discloses to
him a plan to assassinate the triumvirs, thereby delivering world
power into Pompey's hands, but Pompey dismisses the scheme as an
affront to his honor. Meanwhile, one of Antony's -generals wins
a victory over the kingdom of Parthia.</p>
<p>	Antony and Octavia depart for Athens. Once they are gone,
Caesar breaks his truce, wages war against Pompey, and defeats him. After
using Lepidus's army to secure a victory, he accuses Lepidus of treason,
imprisons him, and confiscates his land and possessions. This news
angers Antony, as do the rumors that Caesar has been speaking out
against him in public. Octavia pleads with Antony to maintain a
peaceful relationship with her brother. Should Antony and Caesar
fight, she says, her affections would be painfully divided. Antony
dispatches her to Rome on a peace mission, and quickly returns to
Egypt and Cleopatra. There, he raises a large army to fight Caesar,
and Caesar, incensed over Antony's treatment of his sister, responds
in kind. Caesar commands his army and navy to Egypt. Ignoring all
advice to the contrary, Antony elects to fight him at sea, allowing
Cleopatra to command a ship despite Enobarbus's strong objections.
Antony's forces lose the battle when Cleopatra's ship flees and
Antony's follows, leaving the rest of the fleet vulnerable.</p>
<p>	Antony despairs, condemning Cleopatra for leading him
into infamy but quickly forgiving her. He and Cleopatra send requests
to their conqueror: Antony asks to be allowed to live in Egypt,
while Cleopatra asks that her kingdom be passed down to her rightful heirs.
Caesar dismisses Antony's request, but he promises Cleopatra a fair
hearing if she betrays her lover. Cleopatra seems to be giving thought
to Caesar's message when Antony barges in, curses her for her treachery,
and orders the innocent messenger whipped. When, moments later,
Antony forgives Cleopatra, Enobarbus decides that his master is
finished and defects to Caesar's camp.</p>
<p>	Antony meets Caesar's troops in battle and scores an
unexpected victory. When he learns of Enobarbus's desertion, Antony
laments his own bad fortune, which he believes has corrupted an
honorable man. He sends his friend's possessions to Caesar's camp
and returns to Cleopatra to celebrate his victory. Enobarbus, undone
by shame at his own disloyalty, bows under the weight of his guilt
and dies. Another day brings another battle, and once again Antony
meets Caesar at sea. As before, the Egyptian fleet proves treacherous;
it abandons the fight and leaves Antony to suffer defeat. Convinced that
his lover has betrayed him, Antony vows to kill Cleopatra. In order
to protect herself, she quarters herself in her monument and sends
word that she has committed suicide. Antony, racked with grief,
determines to join his queen in the afterlife. He commands one of
his attendants to fulfill his promise of unquestioned service and kill
him. The attendant kills himself instead. Antony then falls on his own
sword, but the wound is not immediately fatal. He is carried to Cleopatra's
monument, where the lovers are reunited briefly before Antony's
death. Caesar takes the queen prisoner, planning to display her
in Rome as a testament to the might of his empire, but she learns
of his plan and kills herself with the help of several poisonous snakes.
Caesar has her buried beside Antony.</p>

Our Story

On the heels of our first successful reading of Voodoo Macbeth, we bring you one of the greatest Shakespearean love stories, Antony and Cleopatra.


Synopsis

Mark Antony, one of the three
rulers of the Roman Empire, spends his time in Egypt,
living a life of decadence and conducting an affair with the country's
beautiful queen, Cleopatra. When a message arrives informing him
that his wife, Fulvia, is dead and that Pompey is raising an army
to rebel against the triumvirate, Antony decides to return to Rome.
In Antony's absence, Octavius Caesar and Lepidus, his fellow triumvirs,
worry about Pompey's increasing strength. Caesar condemns Antony
for neglecting his duties as a statesman and military officer in
order to live a decadent life by Cleopatra's side.




	The news of his wife's death and imminent battle pricks

Upon his arrival, he and Caesar quarrel, while Lepidus ineffectually

Octavia, who will solidify their loyalty to one another. Enobarbus,

Cleopatra to command a ship despite Enobarbus's strong objections.
Antony's forces lose the battle when Cleopatra's ship flees and
Antony's follows, leaving the rest of the fleet vulnerable.
	Antony despairs, condemning Cleopatra for leading him
into infamy but quickly forgiving her. He and Cleopatra send requests
to their conqueror: Antony asks to be allowed to live in Egypt,
while Cleopatra asks that her kingdom be passed down to her rightful heirs.
Caesar dismisses Antony's request, but he promises Cleopatra a fair
hearing if she betrays her lover. Cleopatra seems to be giving thought
to Caesar's message when Antony barges in, curses her for her treachery,
and orders the innocent messenger whipped. When, moments later,
Antony forgives Cleopatra, Enobarbus decides that his master is
finished and defects to Caesar's camp.
	Antony meets Caesar's troops in battle and scores an
unexpected victory. When he learns of Enobarbus's desertion, Antony
laments his own bad fortune, which he believes has corrupted an
honorable man. He sends his friend's possessions to Caesar's camp
and returns to Cleopatra to celebrate his victory. Enobarbus, undone
by shame at his own disloyalty, bows under the weight of his guilt
and dies. Another day brings another battle, and once again Antony
meets Caesar at sea. As before, the Egyptian fleet proves treacherous;
it abandons the fight and leaves Antony to suffer defeat. Convinced that
his lover has betrayed him, Antony vows to kill Cleopatra. In order
to protect herself, she quarters herself in her monument and sends
word that she has committed suicide. Antony, racked with grief,
determines to join his queen in the afterlife. He commands one of
his attendants to fulfill his promise of unquestioned service and kill
him. The attendant kills himself instead. Antony then falls on his own
sword, but the wound is not immediately fatal. He is carried to Cleopatra's
monument, where the lovers are reunited briefly before Antony's
death. Caesar takes the queen prisoner, planning to display her
in Rome as a testament to the might of his empire, but she learns
of his plan and kills herself with the help of several poisonous snakes.
Caesar has her buried beside Antony.

<p>I've been invited to perform as a guest by Henrique Fontes, the artistic director of <a href=""http://www.casadaribeira.com.br"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Casa da Ribeira</a>, an educational and cultural center in Natal on the Northeast coast of Brazil. The play, called <i>Lamatown</i>, is adapted from Henryk Ibsen's <i>Enemy of the People</i> and will be created with the performers in a three month collaborative process based on elements of Richard Schechner's Environmental Theatre. It is co-directed by Fontes and Michele Minnick, who worked extensively with Schechner to develop <a href=""http://rasaboxes.org/about/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">rasaboxes</a>, a physical and emotional tool for training actors and creating performance. Check out Minnick and Paula Murray Cole's article about rasaboxes <a href=""http://rasaboxes.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/the-actor-as-athlete-of-the-emtions2.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>.</p>
<p>Fontes has secured a grant that covers housing and a modest living stipend for three months while I am working on the project. The only missing piece is the plane ticket to Brazil, which is very expensive and beyond my current budget. The opportunity came together on short notice, and I have to come up with airfare pronto! </p> </div> <div> <h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>Pretty straightforward. Airfare to Brazil is hovering at about $1450, and the longer I wait, the more costly it gets. Your donation will go entirely to cover airfare. </p>
<p>Any funding above and beyond this goal will go towards travel within Brazil to see friends and network with artists in Rio de Janeiro and São Paolo. </p>
<p>As a thank you for your generosity, I offer the following gifts:</p> <ul>
<li>$5 - My undying gratitude.</li>
<li>$10 - My undying gratitude and a hand written postcard from Brazil.</li>
<li>$25 - All of the above + a descriptive and evocative hand written letter sent to you by post.</li>
<li>$50 - All of the above + photos of Brazil taken by me sent to you by post.</li>
<li>$100 - All of the above + a short documentary video, narrated by me, at least partly in Portuguese, which brings to life the sights and sounds of Brazil.</li>
</ul>I am approaching this as an occasion to connect more fully with you, my friends and supporters, in a way that goes beyond the daily snippets and micro interactions of the digital world. Don't get me wrong, I love digital communication, and use it obsessively. But for me this journey is largely about reconnecting with the physical world, with the physical sensations, smells, and sounds of a specific time and place. Through these objects, I hope to share with you a little bit of that physical connectedness to a place that until now I have loved only from afar. </div><div>Abraços a todos!</div><div>
<h3>What This Means for Me</h3> <p>There are a few strands of this project that are equally important to me.</p> <ul>
<li>The People of Brazil: My first encounter with members of <a href=""http://www.lumeteatro.com.br"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">LUME Teatro</a>, nearly 15 years ago, sparked a deep fascination with Brazilian performance and love for the wonderful, kind, intense people of Brazil. Since then I've made many Brazilian friends, and recently completed a stint as a performance facilitator at MoMA in <a href=""http://www.moma.org/visit/calendar/exhibitions/1462"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">an exhibition on Brazilian artist Lygia Clark</a>, which was a magical experience that deepened my appreciation for the social, spiritual, and sensory nature of art in Brazil. <i>Lamatown</i> will be a valuable opportunity to strengthen these relationships and further develop artistic connections for future collaborations. </li> <li>The Play: <i>Lamatown</i>, (lama=mud) based on Ibsen's <i>Enemy of the People, </i>is a superb play, and speaks to some key themes in our interconnected contemporary world, including environmentalism, corruption, globalization, and the complicated politics of doing the right thing. This will be a significant opportunity to explore these themes both in theory and practice. As a foreigner living in Brazil I will occupy a rare vantage point from which to observe and contribute to this discussion as it relates to specific challenges in Brazilian society. </li>
<li>The Process: I first worked with a training method that was similar to rasaboxes (although less thoroughly articulated) while a student at the Dell'Arte International School of Physical Theatre. After researching rasaboxes and realizing the potential for building rich expressionistic characters and creating fully committed physical phrases for performance, I incorporated it into the working process for <i><a href=""http://www.markjeffreyhayes.com/archive.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Woyzeck</a></i>, which I co-directed with Ben Roberts and Ominous Horse Theatre Company in Portland, Oregon a couple years ago. Last summer I had the opportunity to train with Minnick during an intensive three week session at the start of a master's program in Performance Studies at NYU, and recently I assisted Minnick in teaching rasaboxes and contact improvisation to the incoming graduate students at NYU. It is an extraordinary tool for performance, training, and physical and emotional exercise. This project will deepen my engagement with rasaboxes as a tool for devising, which I intend to incorporate into further teaching and performance work. </li>
</ul>
</div><div><ul></ul></div> <div> <h3></h3>
<h3>Challenges</h3>
<div>The project begins soon—September 24th! I am limiting this campaign to 10 days because beyond this, airfare is likely to become too costly for me to go. If I can't raise the funds by September 7th, I may have to cancel. </div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help </h3>
<p>Even if you can't contribute, you can still help by sharing my campaign, and encouraging others to contribute. </p>
<p>Thank you for your support! </p>
<p>Muito obrigado!</p>

Any funding above and beyond this goal will go towards travel within Brazil to see friends and network with artists in Rio de Janeiro and São Paolo. 
As a thank you for your generosity, I offer the following gifts: 
$5 - My undying gratitude.
$10 - My undying gratitude and a hand written postcard from Brazil.
$25 - All of the above + a descriptive and evocative hand written letter sent to you by post.
$50 - All of the above + photos of Brazil taken by me sent to you by post.
$100 - All of the above + a short documentary video, narrated by me, at least partly in Portuguese, which brings to life the sights and sounds of Brazil.
I am approaching this as an occasion to connect more fully with you, my friends and supporters, in a way that goes beyond the daily snippets and micro interactions of the digital world. Don't get me wrong, I love digital communication, and use it obsessively. But for me this journey is largely about reconnecting with the physical world, with the physical sensations, smells, and sounds of a specific time and place. Through these objects, I hope to share with you a little bit of that physical connectedness to a place that until now I have loved only from afar. Abraços a todos!
What This Means for Me There are a few strands of this project that are equally important to me. 
The People of Brazil: My first encounter with members of LUME Teatro, nearly 15 years ago, sparked a deep fascination with Brazilian performance and love for the wonderful, kind, intense people of Brazil. Since then I've made many Brazilian friends, and recently completed a stint as a performance facilitator at MoMA in an exhibition on Brazilian artist Lygia Clark, which was a magical experience that deepened my appreciation for the social, spiritual, and sensory nature of art in Brazil. Lamatown will be a valuable opportunity to strengthen these relationships and further develop artistic connections for future collaborations.  The Play: Lamatown, (lama=mud) based on Ibsen's Enemy of the People, is a superb play, and speaks to some key themes in our interconnected contemporary world, including environmentalism, corruption, globalization, and the complicated politics of doing the right thing. This will be a significant opportunity to explore these themes both in theory and practice. As a foreigner living in Brazil I will occupy a rare vantage point from which to observe and contribute to this discussion as it relates to specific challenges in Brazilian society. 
The Process: I first worked with a training method that was similar to rasaboxes (although less thoroughly articulated) while a student at the Dell'Arte International School of Physical Theatre. After researching rasaboxes and realizing the potential for building rich expressionistic characters and creating fully committed physical phrases for performance, I incorporated it into the working process for Woyzeck, which I co-directed with Ben Roberts and Ominous Horse Theatre Company in Portland, Oregon a couple years ago. Last summer I had the opportunity to train with Minnick during an intensive three week session at the start of a master's program in Performance Studies at NYU, and recently I assisted Minnick in teaching rasaboxes and contact improvisation to the incoming graduate students at NYU. It is an extraordinary tool for performance, training, and physical and emotional exercise. This project will deepen my engagement with rasaboxes as a tool for devising, which I intend to incorporate into further teaching and performance work. 

  
Challenges
The project begins soon—September 24th! I am limiting this campaign to 10 days because beyond this, airfare is likely to become too costly for me to go. If I can't raise the funds by September 7th, I may have to cancel. 
Other Ways You Can Help 
Even if you can't contribute, you can still help by sharing my campaign, and encouraging others to contribute.

</h3>
<p>Native to Vancouver, we are a small theatre company interested in exploring the darker side of human kind. Monster Moon was founded in the summer of 2012 with our very first production of <i>Danny and the Deep Blue Sea</i>. It is a script we have watched grow from a movement-based performance into an intimate, naturalistic piece. It's been a dream of ours to take <i>Danny </i> to the Edinburgh Fringe for many years now and, with your help, it can become a reality! With your support, we will be able to perform our very first international show at the biggest Fringe festival in the world. <br/><br/></p>
<h3>What We Need From You.</h3>Our total goal for this project to get our base funding of $5,000. This campaign is going to attribute for $2,000 of that. This is the bare minimum we need to do the show, and the extra $3,000 will allow us to get our ideal set, costumes, lighting, insurance and all the other fun things (i.e. proper insurance)! This $2,000, along with other fundraisers we have done in the past will help us get:<p><br/></p>

<h3>C'est quoi ça, Solos? <br/>
</h3>
<p>Solos, c'est une présentation de <a href=""http://www.bloodyunderrated.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bloody Underrated</a> et <a href=""http://www.pleinespace.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Plein Espace</a>, en collaboration avec le <a href=""http://www.mainlinetheatre.ca/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Théâtre MainLine</a>. Ensemble, on veut créer un nouveau festival annuel qui célèbre la création solo, qui aura lieu de 6 au 9 novembre 2013. Pourquoi? Parce que c'est fascinant de voir ce qu'un individu peut créer dans un environnement où il est seul. Parce que la liberté de création solo permet de prendre des risques inhabituels, et d'en être le seul perdant si ça ne marche pas. Bref, parce que des spectacles solos, on adore ça, et on en veut plus.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Ce qu'on a besoin, ce que vous recevez.</h3>
<p>Avec cette campagne de financement, on tente d'obtenir 1500$ pour aider avec la mise en marché et la production générale du festival. Cette somme nous permettra d'imprimer nos affiches, programmes, billets, etc. De plus, cette somme nous aidera à couvrir les frais de location de salle et de répétitions techniques des artistes. Avec un don, vous pouvez recevoir :</p>
<p>- Un remerciement dans notre programme;</p>
<p>- Une affiche signée par les artistes;</p>
<p>- Un billet, une paire de billets, ou même une passe valide pour tous les spectacles;</p>
<p>- Une soirée au resto avant votre spectacle;</p>
<p>- Des billets pour des événements de Bloody Underrated pour les 6 prochains mois;</p>
<p>- Notre amour éternel;</p>
<p>- Plus encore!</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Ça donne quoi, finalement?</h3>
<p>Ça donne qu'on vous remplit tous vos mois de novembre du futur avec plein de spectacles mémorables, et peut-être même inoubliables. Ça nous permet de donner plus de chances aux artistes solos d'expérimenter avec leurs spectacles, et de les présenter à de nouveaux publics. Ça donne à Montréal un nouveau festival de théâtre bilingue qui encourage la collaboration entre les communautés francophones et anglophones, et qui facilite le partage de public, qui peuvent ici s'unir. Ça donne mal au coeur tellement on veut le faire, avec votre aide!</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Ouin, mais j'ai pas d'argent moi non plus...</h3>
<p>C'est pas grave! Si t'aimes notre projet, on t'encourage à encourager tout le monde que tu connais à contribuer. Aussi, quand viendra le temps du festival, on t'encourage à venir faire du bénévolat avec nous! Un festival, c'est une micro-communauté, et on veut que tu soit dans la nôtre.</p>
<p>Merci!</p>

Solos, c'est une présentation de Bloody Underrated et Plein Espace, en collaboration avec le Théâtre MainLine. Ensemble, on veut créer un nouveau festival annuel qui célèbre la création solo, qui aura lieu de 6 au 9 novembre 2013. Pourquoi? Parce que c'est fascinant de voir ce qu'un individu peut créer dans un environnement où il est seul. Parce que la liberté de création solo permet de prendre des risques inhabituels, et d'en être le seul perdant si ça ne marche pas. Bref, parce que des spectacles solos, on adore ça, et on en veut plus.


Ce qu'on a besoin, ce que vous recevez.
Avec cette campagne de financement, on tente d'obtenir 1500$ pour aider avec la mise en marché et la production générale du festival. Cette somme nous permettra d'imprimer nos affiches, programmes, billets, etc. De plus, cette somme nous aidera à couvrir les frais de location de salle et de répétitions techniques des artistes. Avec un don, vous pouvez recevoir :
- Un remerciement dans notre programme;
- Une affiche signée par les artistes;
- Un billet, une paire de billets, ou même une passe valide pour tous les spectacles;
- Une soirée au resto avant votre spectacle;
- Des billets pour des événements de Bloody Underrated pour les 6 prochains mois;
- Notre amour éternel;
- Plus encore!


Ça donne quoi, finalement?
Ça donne qu'on vous remplit tous vos mois de novembre du futur avec plein de spectacles mémorables, et peut-être même inoubliables. Ça nous permet de donner plus de chances aux artistes solos d'expérimenter avec leurs spectacles, et de les présenter à de nouveaux publics. Ça donne à Montréal un nouveau festival de théâtre bilingue qui encourage la collaboration entre les communautés francophones et anglophones, et qui facilite le partage de public, qui peuvent ici s'unir. Ça donne mal au coeur tellement on veut le faire, avec votre aide!


Ouin, mais j'ai pas d'argent moi non plus...
C'est pas grave! Si t'aimes notre projet, on t'encourage à encourager tout le monde que tu connais à contribuer. Aussi, quand viendra le temps du festival, on t'encourage à venir faire du bénévolat avec nous! Un festival, c'est une micro-communauté, et on veut que tu soit dans la nôtre.
Merci!

What's this ""Solos"" thing?
Solos is a co-presentation by Bloody Underrated and Plein Espace, in collaboration with MainLine Theatre. Together, we aim to create a new annual festival that celebrates solo creations, from November 6th to 9th 2013. Why? Because it's fascinating to see what people create when they're working in a solo environment. Because freedom of creation in a solo setting allows performers to take unusual risks, and to be the only person losing if it all fails - while we all stand to win from their efforts. Really, it's because we love solo shows, and we want more of them.


What we need, what you can get:
With this funding campaign, we're trying to raise 1500$ to help with general production and marketing for the festival. This small sum would allow us to print our posters, programs, tickets, etc. Even more, it would help cover the costs of rental and of technical rehearsals. Don't worry, we're a non-profit - any money coming into this campaign is going right back into the festival, not in our pockets. With your contribution, you can get sweet perks like:
- A great big thank you in our program,
- A poster signed by every artists performing in this year's festival,
- One ticket, a pair of tickets, or even a VIP pass to the festival,
- Dinner for two before your show,
- Tickets to Bloody Underrated events for the next six months,
- Our undying love,
- And more!


And what does this accomplish?
It makes it possible for us to fill all of your future Novembers with memorable, maybe even unforgettable shows. It allows us to give solo artists more chances to experiment with and then display their work, and to take it to new audiences. It gives Montreal a new bilingual festival that encourages Franco and Anglo cultures to collaborate, and that facilitates the sharing of audiences between these two communities, that can be united here. It gives us butterflies in our stomachs and endless jitters because we're dying to make this happen.


Sounds great, but I don't have any money either...
That's totally fine! You can help us by spreading the word through all of your networks if you like what we're trying to do. And then, come festival time, you can help us out by volunteering with us! Festivals are basically micro-communities, and we'd like you to join ours.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Dance on the Lawn is a small, all-volunteer organization dedicated to exposing everyone -- especially folks intimidated by big ticket prices and fancy theaters -- to the glory of dance in all its forms. We present an annual outdoor dance festival, free of charge and open to everyone.  We have also established a mentorship program for young artists, awarding an annual $1000 stipend to an ""Emerging Commissioned New Jersey Choreographer.""  </p>
<p>Our founder, Charmaine Warren, has performed with several New York dance companies and is a former faculty member at The Ailey School, Fordham University, and the Joffrey Ballet School's Jazz and Contemporary Trainee Program. She curates dance festivals for Harlem Stage and the Wassiac Project. Managing Director Laura Marchese is a dancer, arts educator and co-author of Dance to Learn, a developmental dance curriculum currently in use throughout NJ. Under their enthusiastic guidance, DOTL has grown to include an entire team of volunteers are are working hard to help make DOTL 2018 a success.  </p>
<p>Charmaine and Laura are fiercely committed to the power of dance to move us, to change our perspectives, and to deepen our empathy and compassion. They are passionate about sharing that power, and know that Dance on the Lawn can give everyone a chance to see and feel how a little dance can rock your world.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Dance on the Lawn has just one goal -- to present a high-quality, free dance festival on a green lawn. The most important element we need for that is dancers - therefore, the most money we need is for artist stipends. Next, we need a stage and a marley floor for them to dance on, and then, we need the little things like water, refreshments, ice and band-aids. </p>
<p>We have received support from local community organizations in our home base of Montclair, NJ,  including Toni’s Kitchen, Studio042, Jocelyn Hassenfeld, and TonyTurnerPhotography. Additional support comes from The Wassaic Project,<br/>Adria Rolnik PR, and ﻿Dance New Jersey.  </p>
<p>Dance on the Lawn offers the community direct, free and open access to a range of dance companies and performers. Year after year, we see families, seniors, individuals with disabilities, arts aficionados and dance luminaries join together in a celebration of the pure beauty of bodies in motion.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Much of our support is in-kind. The ""lawn,"" for example, is donated.  But pretty much all the rest of it, especially the artist stipends, comes from your contributions. Know that you will have a direct hand in making our festival a reality, and set us on a path to success for the next five years. </p>

</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Although we've only been called Vatra for about a year, we've been spinning fire together for up to three in some cases, with a combined flow, dance and performance time that is too long to count!  During our time with fire, our tool sets have remained very limited due to lack of funds.

<p>New tools would make it possible for us to come up with choreography and new act and routines that we'll surely be showing off at our favorite 3rd friday open mic (Firestage at the Firehouse for those that dont know!) and using for all the gigs we'll be pursuing during this year and all those to come!</p>

</div></div>","Who is Vatra? Vatra is a group of fire performers based in the d
owntown Phoenix arts community. Our amazing and multi-talented little group consists of four main members:     
Amy Jean, Sheri Amour, Crimson Phoenix, and Janey Radiant. (you can see our photos in the gallery above) 
We came together as a group at a little spot called the Firehouse Gallery and have been training and performing together for over two years. Utilizing fire tools such as poi, hoop, batons, fans and a neat little thing called a fire orb, we've done many free performances for the community (and already have plans for more) as well as a few paid gigs here and there. 


   What We Need & What You Get
We want to kick it up a notch... In order to come up with group choreography and duet routines to knock your socks off, we need some new equipment!
All funds go toward improving our performances for you, but more specifically:


Poi sets (4 @ $100 each)
Fan sets  (3-4 @ $110 each)
Palm torch sets (4 @ $85 each) 
Replace a stolen fire hoop ($150-200)
Safety equipment, stage props & fuel ($150-200 per person)
Insurance ($65-80 per person)
Other awesome  fire tools to rock on stage

First and foremost we need matching sets of tools for each member, performers insurance, and safety equipment. Your contribution goes towards strengthening our performances, making us ""legal"" and adding new and exciting tools to our repertoire so we can burn it up, down and all around!
And what do YOU get? Anything from a great big thanks, to a group performance just for you, and all sorts of goodies in between! I'm personally most hopeful I get to make a video to a song of your choice, however we're all quite excited to do the photo shoot for the posters! Yeeeow!
You'll be able to see our new performances at various events in the future. Plus you'll be able to find all of our photos and videos on our website  www.vatracollective.com and our youtube channel at www.youtube.com/vatraphx



  The Impact Although we've only been called Vatra for about a year, we've been spinning fire together for up to three in some cases, with a combined flow, dance and performance time that is too long to count!  During our time with fire, our tool sets have remained very limited due to lack of funds.

  Risks & Challenges 

Little did we know when we found fire spinning, hooping, dance, and stage performance in general, just how much it would cost! In Arizona performers who use fire in their acts are often required to provide proof of insurance, as well as acquire a permit for every individual event they spin at.


  Other Ways You Can Help Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help: 
Spread the word on your favorite social networking site
Design us a better logo
Teach us some of those sweet moves of yours sometime
Buy us a beer at Lost leaf. 
Tell you friends who's doing that thing that you know a professional fire troupe they could hire

<p>Nikima and Louise are co-choreographers. We moved to New York City in August to continue making work together after graduating from Lewis and Clark College last spring. In the past three months we have shown two distinct works and have recently been given the opportunity to recreate an installation we made in college. This work, Extensory, was created in collaboration with our good friend and admired artist Abigail McNamara. It toes the line between dance, installation and performance art. It is also a collaboration with the “audience”, or anyone who is a part of the space.</p>
<p>This rendition of the installation requires two dancers, an architectural structure, several hooks, and two strips of flesh-colored spandex with sleeves sewn into the ends of each. Previously, the installation took place in a small gallery at Lewis and Clark College as part of Abigail McNamara's installation art class. It came to life in the form of a performance open to the LC community.</p>
<p>Extensory will be reborn in Glasshouse gallery in Brooklyn NY on December 4th. The new site welcomes a larger, wider and more diverse audience, in addition to our friends, colleagues and members of our various communities. We would like this piece to reach its fullest potential, but we cannot afford the fabric we need to do so. We feel that Extensory is a milestone in our budding careers as dance-makers, and we are asking for your support in the creation of this project.</p>
<p>This project is important to us because it's an extension of our lives; it's a way of physically demonstrating the metaphysical fabric of life. We are trying to expose something that happens everyday, it is something that is so obvious that it is regularly overlooked. Our work draws attention to our existence in time and space.The installation is an immersive presentation of phenomenology put into practice.</p>
<p>The spandex is an aesthetic highlight of the relationship between our bodies and the rest of the space, the audience, each other, the walls, the air molecules, and everything around us. Our movements have repercussions that can be observed through the shift and pull of the spandex as it supports our weight, slides, follows us, and turns the gallery into a chamber that echoes our movement.</p>
<p>Spandex costs $8/yard. We need 100 yards. We want the fabric strips to be wider then last time; when the original fabrics were stretched taut they lost their width and became thinner. We would like the installation to have as much fabric as it needs so that we can focus on the play of movement. There are other costs; we would like to give our photographer and videographer an honorarium, costumes are $50 and hooks are $40, then the costs of post-production DVDs, the costs of shipping DVDs and groceries for the dinner we'll cook our $400+ bidders. If we don't reach our final goal then all involved in this project will not be adequately compensated for their dedication and hard work. </p>
<p>Extensory is the beginning of a long journey. Nikima, Abigail, and Louise have been working on it for close to a year and hope to continue elaborating and collaborating on this concept for years to come. Today we need you to get it off the ground. </p>

<h2><strong>The Brewing Dept.</strong></h2>
<p>The Brewing Dept. (TBD) is a collective of theater artists committed to separating the definition of artistic success from the idea of a final, polished performance. Instead, we encourage a mindset of constant development. We apply the multifaceted vantage point and skills of the collective to the particular goals of the individual artist, aiming to create on a project-by-project basis the unique environment best suited to achieving that artist's goals. We are committed to developing a work in this way before any effort is made to produce it, and we are equally committed to producing work in ways that further its development. At The Brewing Dept., we develop to produce and produce to develop. </p>
<p>Works of theater require an audience, so we also aim to provide our artists with audiences throughout the creative process. Audiences will be present for the development of a project and, we hope, the production of it. Our goal is to begin conversations between artist and audience at the beginning of a project’s life, and continue it well after that project’s closing performance.</p></div>","The Living Room

We are committed to developing a work in this way before any effort is made to produce it, and we are equally committed to producing work in ways that further its development. At The Brewing Dept., we develop to produce and produce to develop. 
Works of theater require an audience, so we also aim to provide our artists with audiences throughout the creative process. Audiences will be present for the development of a project and, we hope, the production of it. Our goal is to begin conversations between artist and audience at the beginning of a project’s life, and continue it well after that project’s closing performance.",0.0,0,"10 Campaigns

<p><strong>Stage Scene &amp; Song Performing Arts (3sPA)</strong> is committed to allowing teens to explore all the creative and practical facets of the theater and performance industry. Here, they can thrive in the discovery and development of their individual talents, build leadership skills, experience the thrill of community achievement, and have the confidence to know that, with respect and collaboration, they can create living theater art from nothing! </p>
<p>The <strong>Summer Youth Theater Collaborative</strong> is a thrilling 5-week program that meets 5 days a week, 7 hours a day (9am-4pm), from July 1 through August 4th, 2013. It culminates in a fully realized production of the award-winning musical, <em><strong>Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,</strong></em> by Jeffrey Lane and David Yazbek, at the beautiful Adler Theater at Ramapo College, in New Jersey.</p>
<p>Participants will work with our directors and associates who will mentor them on the different aspects of theater production: set, costume, props, lighting and sound design, performance, directing, and stage management - even producing. We also offer college students who major in the various theater disciplines, as well as professionals in the industry, the opportunity to become mentors and share their knowledge and experience, helping to inspire the next generation of theater writers, performers, designers, and technicians. Each day is made up a combination of rehearsal and production design and development sessions. No group will work in a vacuum - designers will sit in on rehearsals to get a greater understanding of the musical and the roles being developed by the actors, while actors will interact with designers as the physical production grows from preliminary concepts and sketches to a fully staged show.</p>
<h3>Campaign Goals</h3>
<p>We are a non-profit-pending performing arts company. 3sPA encourages cultural diversity; emphasizes inclusion, respect, and collaboration; and offers top instruction for reduced tuition so that all who want to participate can participate. Your campaign contributions will be used for rehearsal and performance space rentals and production costs that cannot be covered by ticket sales or the modest summer tuition. </p>
<h3><strong>What You Get</strong></h3>
<div>All contributors will be acknowledged as sponsors in our program. Check the descriptions on the right to see what each level offers. All contributors will also get the satisfaction of knowing they've helped change a teenager's life this summer.</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Nothing is more rewarding than witnessing young people explore and pursue their dreams. Without your contributions, funds are limited which could increase tuition costs for future productions. That limits enrollment, which surely limits opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>Stage Scene &amp; Song's</strong> founders, Frank Avellino, Argine Safari and Ellyn Essig, have a long history of working with young people who have gone on to successful careers on the stages of New York, Philadelphia and Boston, from regional theaters to Broadway. Their combined talents and dedication provide a perfect playground to inspire individuality and self worth in youngsters while still fostering a mutual respect for peers, a tremendous sense of community and camaraderie, and an appreciation for contribution.</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p> I'm Rik Deskin, the Artistic Director of Eclectic Theater Company. I am the Curator of all Theatre, Improv, Stand-Up and Sketch Comedy programming at the Odd Duck Studio, a 49-seat Black-Box theater venue in Seattle, WA that is an artistic home to many theatre artists in the Puget Sound area. We also rent out the theater to itinerant Theatre companies and Improv groups. In July, a theatre company that had planned to rent the theater in August, cancelled and for various reasons, three of our regular Improv groups also cancelled previously scheduled performances. This left us little time to rebook the slots that had been on hold and suddenly without anticipated vital rental and box-office income that was needed to maintain our basic expense of monthly rent. And it put us behind in rent for July. <br/></p>
<p> The property management company that we pay a monthly rent of $1500 has agreed not to add any more late fees if we can pay this month's rent plus what is still due from last month amounting to $2075.69 by Monday, August 15.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>It is vital that the Odd Duck Studio remain sustainable as it is a venue utilized by many performers in and around Seattle for shows, rehearsals, classes and more. And it is a regular destination for patrons locally and tourists seeking out unique and interesting entertainment. Currently there are 7 shows playing throughout August that include <span style=""font-style: italic;""><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Zelda</span></span><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">, </span><span style=""font-style: italic;""><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">The Comedy Workshop</span></span><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">, </span><span style=""font-style: italic;""><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Brown Bag Comedy, Drop The Root Beer &amp; Run, Closet Monsters Improv, Seattle Monthly Mash-Up </span></span>and <span style=""font-style: italic;""><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">The Big Bully Comedy Show</span></span>. Every Tuesday night, a Playwrights group called <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">WARP </span>meets to read new plays being developed by local Playwrights. <span style=""font-style: italic;""><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">September Skies</span></span> is a new play by a Seattle Playwright that is currently in rehearsals for a 5 week run that previews September 1. In upcoming months we also offer a number of Free Staged readings of new Plays and Screenplays. We literally have shows playing every week, year-round. We also lease out one of our three studio spaces to <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Alleged Tattoo</span><span style=""font-style: italic;"">, </span>an independent tattoo studio owned by local graphic artist, Lisa Orth. If we are unable to complete this campaign, it may result in being evicted and the loss of a vital space used by and loved by many artists and audience members.<br/></p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>A small group of Danish performance artists have been accepted into the Midtown International Theatre Festival in Manhattan New york, to perform in July 2013. We will be performing TRAPPED.</p>
<ul>
<li>TRAPPED is a physical abstract portrait of the dehydrated artist through time. Chained to reality and left to die our 5 characters are fighting against the box of Normality, Sexual Frustration, Feminism and Artistic dehydration.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The 5 characters of TRAPPED are loosely based on the following artists:       <strong>Pablo</strong> <strong>Picasso</strong> &amp; <strong>Dora</strong> <strong>Maar</strong> <em>who were involved intimately and Artistically for 9 years</em>. <strong>Raoul</strong> <strong>Hausmann</strong> &amp; <strong>Hannah</strong> <strong>Höch</strong>, <em>Who were also involved intimately and Artistically</em>. Last but not least <strong>Claude</strong> <strong>Cahun</strong> who was a transgender and best known for her self-portrait photographs and poetry.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>TRAPPED captures the moment in time which every artist experiences at some point in their life. - That exact moment when the Artist must choose to either fight for their ART or SURRENDER into the box that has been created for them by parents, religion, society, government and life. In TRAPPED we go inside the minds of the masters to see what happens when they have to choose - Do they dare to break out of the box of Normality or do they try to fit in?</li>
</ul>

We make creative work ranging from photography, video art, art installations, dance and theater pieces, interdisciplinary collaborations and training projects.</p>
<div> </div>
<div> At this time we are about to culminate and officially premiere our piece titled <strong>FLOATING POINT WAVES.</strong> Rooted in the body, our collaboration work exist at the interconnection of visual, sound, choreographic and dramatic elements. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<strong>FLOATING POINT WAVES </strong>is scheduled to premier in New York at the OBIE Award-winning downtown theater HERE. We will have 8 performances, from <strong>April 6 to April 14</strong>. </div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>As we get closer to this much anticipated premier we need YOUR support! </strong></div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<strong>FLOATING POINTS WAVES </strong>is fundamentally a performance experience of solo dance, real-time video, live electronic music, water and kinetic sculptures. Floating Point Waves unveils the relationship between the human body and natural elements as movement, water and light connect in an organic causal chain. Every motion of the dance is reflected in the elements that surround it, creating an environment where beauty coexists with darkness.  From a microscopic scale as on the cellular level of the human body, to societal structures and behaviors, to a macroscopic scale such as the laws of physics governing the universe, we are challenged and stimulated toward an awareness of the interconnectedness of life. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<strong>FLOATING POINT WAVES</strong> is conceived and designed by <strong>Ximena Garnica</strong> and <strong>Shige Moriya</strong> and created in collaboration with sound composer <strong>Jeremy D. Slater</strong> and lighting designer <strong>Solomon Weisbard</strong>. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Your support will provide the means necessary to partially cover the last intense period of rehearsals and production expenses such as artist’s fees for their time and expertise, acquisition of scenic material, food and transportation fees. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>We have prepared great perks for donors, ranging from original screen savers to digital albums to books,  dinners, original art work (a good chance to start your art collection or grow it) and even a custom made installation for your house or garden! Not amount is too small or too large! </div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong><span style=""color: #006633;"">Your donation will:</span></strong></div>
<div> • Pay the composer-musician and lighting designer (Jeremy Slater and Solomon Weisbard for the long hours of rehearsal!)</div>
<div> • Feed them when they start to fade out after our 8 hours long rehearsals </div>
<div> • Pay our collaborator’s train tickets so that we might all be in the same place for said rehearsals </div>
<div> • Pay for the materials use in the construction of the sculptures and pool installation </div>
<div> • Allow us to document the performances (still photography and video) so that Floating Point Waves can have a life beyond these performances. And if we are lucky enough to overshoot our goal, your donation will: </div>

</div></div>","Hello! we are Shige Moriya and Ximena Garnica. We make creative work ranging from photography, video art, art installations, dance and theater pieces, interdisciplinary collaborations and training projects.
 
 At this time we are about to culminate and officially premiere our piece titled FLOATING POINT WAVES. Rooted in the body, our collaboration work exist at the interconnection of visual, sound, choreographic and dramatic elements. 
 

FLOATING POINT WAVES is scheduled to premier in New York at the OBIE Award-winning downtown theater HERE. We will have 8 performances, from April 6 to April 14. 
 
As we get closer to this much anticipated premier we need YOUR support! 
 

FLOATING POINTS WAVES is fundamentally a performance experience of solo dance, real-time video, live electronic music, water and kinetic sculptures. Floating Point Waves unveils the relationship between the human body and natural elements as movement, water and light connect in an organic causal chain. Every motion of the dance is reflected in the elements that surround it, creating an environment where beauty coexists with darkness.  From a microscopic scale as on the cellular level of the human body, to societal structures and behaviors, to a macroscopic scale such as the laws of physics governing the universe, we are challenged and stimulated toward an awareness of the interconnectedness of life. 
 

FLOATING POINT WAVES is conceived and designed by Ximena Garnica and Shige Moriya and created in collaboration with sound composer Jeremy D. Slater and lighting designer Solomon Weisbard. 
 
Your support will provide the means necessary to partially cover the last intense period of rehearsals and production expenses such as artist’s fees for their time and expertise, acquisition of scenic material, food and transportation fees. 
 
We have prepared great perks for donors, ranging from original screen savers to digital albums to books,  dinners, original art work (a good chance to start your art collection or grow it) and even a custom made installation for your house or garden! Not amount is too small or too large! 
 
Your donation will:
 • Pay the composer-musician and lighting designer (Jeremy Slater and Solomon Weisbard for the long hours of rehearsal!)
 • Feed them when they start to fade out after our 8 hours long rehearsals 
 • Pay our collaborator’s train tickets so that we might all be in the same place for said rehearsals 
 • Pay for the materials use in the construction of the sculptures and pool installation 
 • Allow us to document the performances (still photography and video) so that Floating Point Waves can have a life beyond these performances. And if we are lucky enough to overshoot our goal, your donation will: 
 • Pay for the production cost of the Floating Point Waves process book which will include a CD and DVD of the material generated during the making of the show. 
 
 Thank you so for your interest and support. We could not make this happen without you! 




Do you want to donate but can't do it online?No problem! You can always send us a check and you will still receive the perks. All checks should be made to CAVE Organization, Inc. Please write in the memo: Floating Point Waves donation. If you find the way to donate online it will be great... It is so fun to see how the donation number grows! Thank you so much!

<h3>
<em>For the Lulz</em> by Ben Ferber</h3>
</div>
<div><span><span class=""fsl"">The blogosphere watches in horror as a hacktivist, a phreaker, and a cyberterrorist wage war on each other for money, for revenge, and for the lulz. A true-to-life net-noir that asks: Can a hashtag change your life? #forthelulz @ForTheLulzShow</span></span></div>
<div> </div>
<div>This new play by Ben Ferber is an unapologetic look at internet culture with all its flaws and glory, blurring the lines between our web-ready public and our private lives. The play focuses on the intersections of four netizens: Fay, a technology and culture blogger; poof, a cyber terrorist; MrJ, a grey hat hacktivist; and Gale, an ex-con college professor. After a major hacking spree that cripples most social media websites, Fay seeks to uncover the identity of the internet criminal know as ""poof."" But as poof reminds us, ""Those who dig deep get buried.""</div>
<div> </div>
<div>People today are comfortable on the internet. When the internet first became a household possibility, people were concerned about contracting viruses, and kept their personal information close and private. Today, people tell 500 of their Facebook friends the exact location of the Starbucks where they just got their coffee. <em>For the Lulz </em>tears away our security blanket and shows us just how fragile our idea of privacy on the internet truly is. What makes <em>For the </em><em>Lulz </em>truly terrifying is just how much is taken from true stories and actual headlines--this play is not a morality tale or horror story. This is real life. This is the internet.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>And yet here we are, asking for money, over the internet. #lulz #oops?</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Horn&amp;Ivory Productions' <em>For the Lulz </em>by Ben Ferber will premiere in the inaugural season of Portland Stage Studio Rep this February. Studio Rep is an excellent opportunity for a young company like ourselves to showcase new and interesting work.</div>

<h3>Horn&amp;Ivory Productions</h3>
<div>Horn&amp;Ivory Productions is focused on producing new work and recontextualized classics. We seek not to entertain or cajole, but to push the limits of theatrical mode and storytelling. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Todd Brian Backus, Shannon Stockwell, and Ella Wrenn came together after spending a year at Portland Stage participating in their internship program from 2011 to 2012. When they all found themselves remaining in the Portland area after their internships concluded, they decided to continue exploring their love of theatre through creating their own company. Horn&amp;Ivory focuses on producing new work and recontextualized classics, especially concentrating on the unrealistic and fantastical.<br/> </div>

<h2>The short of it:</h2>
<p>We are VILLAINS - a group of young theatre artists dedicated to examining our culture by staging old stories in new contexts.  Our next project is OCEAN KINGDOM - the story of Shakespeare's Pericles getting lost in other stories - an immersive and visceral audience experience.  The show will go up this March - but only with your help.</p>
<p>We need to raise $5000 to cover our production costs and performance space rental - or else OCEAN KINGDOM might not become a reality.  So we're turning to you, our strongest supporters, so ask for contributions.  In return, we are offering some awesome perks, including free tickets and drink vouchers.  With your help, we can create a thought-provoking show and jump-start a unique and sustainable performance company.</p>
Check out our page below for more details!  Thank you for your support.</div>
<div>
<br/><h2>The long of it:</h2>
<h2>WHAT IS VILLAINS PERFORMANCE?</h2>
<p>VILLAINS is a group of young theatre artists under the artistic direction of Douglas Eacho in Brooklyn, New York.  Our mission is to examine the world we live in through the lens of misplaced stories.  We steal old plays, yank them out of their traditional contexts, and turn them into spectacular, unsettling experiences that make us think about our culture - and how it could be better. We are committed to making sustainable theatre by building a repertory of work, using and re-using found objects, texts and spaces.</p>
<p>We invite you to read more about us <a href=""http://villainsperformance.org/about/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">on our website</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>WHAT IS OCEAN KINGDOM?<br/></strong></h2>
<p id=""yui_3_7_3_1_1359567473376_129""><strong>OCEAN KINGDOM </strong>is a theatrical mash-up.  Imagine a Girl Talk CD, made from popular plays instead of popular songs, and one man living through them who would very much like it all to stop.  That man is Pericles, from that Shakespeare shipwreck play that nobody's read.  The culture he drowns in is our own.  Can he escape to another world? </p>
<p id=""yui_3_7_3_1_1359567473376_133"">Featuring cheerleaders, a live DJ, multiple stages, plenty of beer, and glo-tape. Dress for a rave, watch out for the Splash Zone, and don't let one man's anguish spoil your fun.</p>
<p>Ocean Kingdom will run March 21-30, 2013 at <a href=""http://www.magicfuturebox.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Magic FutureBox</a>, a beautiful warehouse theatre in Sunset Park, and the perfect creative home for OCEAN KINGDOM.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<h2>WHERE'S THE MONEY GOING?</h2>
<p>Your donation will help us create <em>sustainable</em>, <em>economical</em> theatre by purchasing:</p>
<p><strong>The most affordable perfomance space money can buy.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Magic FutureBox is bigger and more flexible than any space in Manhattan - <em><strong>at one quarter of the cost</strong></em>.</li>
</ul><p><strong>An effective and minimal production design.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The majority of our set, lights, costumes and props will be found objects - from Magic FutureBox, our closets and props warehouses.</li>
<li>We will still need to purchase some items - some wood to build a few platforms, some material for costumes, and, of course, glo-tape.  But, our minimalistic production aesthetic means we won't be purchasing much, so we can keep costs down<strong>.</strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>What we <em>do</em> use, we will <em>re-</em>use:</strong> Your donation will fund <em>several</em> future productions, rather than just this one.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Small stipends for our artists.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Artists are the most sustainable aspect of theatre.</strong>  Rather than paying for an elaborate set that will be torn down and thrown away, we will pay our artists so they can come back and make more meaningful art that you want to see.</li>
</ul><p>Your donation will also help us keep ticket prices down to $15, so that our work will be affordable and accessible.</p>
<p>We would be happy to provide you with a detailed breakdown of our budget.  Please e-mail us at <a href=""mailto:villainsperformance@gmail.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""villainsperformance@gmail.com"">villainsperformance@gmail.com</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>WHY VILLAINS?</h2>
<p><strong>We've done this before - we can do it again.<br/></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Last time, it was cutting <em>Hamlet</em> down to an hour and performing it for one audience member at a time.  <em>Stand and Unfold Yourself</em>, which premiered at Brown University in 2011, was innovative, gripping, and highly praised by the community.  We are ready to take it to the next level with OCEAN KINGDOM.</li>
<li>Be sure to check out our previous work on our <a href=""http://villainsperformance.org/past-work/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">website</a>!</li>
</ul><p><strong>Your donation goes beyond OCEAN KINGDOM.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Your donation will help us get VILLAINS off the ground, jump-starting a unique company with a sustainable model.</li>
</ul><p><strong>We can't do it without you.<br/></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>This is a fixed funding campaign. </strong> We must raise $5000 by March 4 at midnight, or else we get nothing.  This means we would have to scale down even more, raise our ticket prices and pray that we make up what we spent in the box office - which, as recent college graduates, is an investment none of us can afford to make.</li>
</ul><p>We need YOUR help to fully realize OCEAN KINGDOM, and to get VILLAINS up and running.  We appreciate your support, and we want thank you - Check out our perks on the right!</p>

We are VILLAINS - a group of young theatre artists dedicated to examining our culture by staging old stories in new contexts.  Our next project is OCEAN KINGDOM - the story of Shakespeare's Pericles getting lost in other stories - an immersive and visceral audience experience.  The show will go up this March - but only with your help.
We need to raise $5000 to cover our production costs and performance space rental - or else OCEAN KINGDOM might not become a reality.  So we're turning to you, our strongest supporters, so ask for contributions.  In return, we are offering some awesome perks, including free tickets and drink vouchers.  With your help, we can create a thought-provoking show and jump-start a unique and sustainable performance company.
Check out our page below for more details!  Thank you for your support.

The long of it:
WHAT IS VILLAINS PERFORMANCE?
VILLAINS is a group of young theatre artists under the artistic direction of Douglas Eacho in Brooklyn, New York.  Our mission is to examine the world we live in through the lens of misplaced stories.  We steal old plays, yank them out of their traditional contexts, and turn them into spectacular, unsettling experiences that make us think about our culture - and how it could be better. We are committed to making sustainable theatre by building a repertory of work, using and re-using found objects, texts and spaces.
We invite you to read more about us on our website.
 
WHAT IS OCEAN KINGDOM?
OCEAN KINGDOM is a theatrical mash-up.  Imagine a Girl Talk CD, made from popular plays instead of popular songs, and one man living through them who would very much like it all to stop.  That man is Pericles, from that Shakespeare shipwreck play that nobody's read.  The culture he drowns in is our own.  Can he escape to another world? 
Featuring cheerleaders, a live DJ, multiple stages, plenty of beer, and glo-tape. Dress for a rave, watch out for the Splash Zone, and don't let one man's anguish spoil your fun.
Ocean Kingdom will run March 21-30, 2013 at Magic FutureBox, a beautiful warehouse theatre in Sunset Park, and the perfect creative home for OCEAN KINGDOM.
 

WHERE'S THE MONEY GOING?
Your donation will help us create sustainable, economical theatre by purchasing:
The most affordable perfomance space money can buy.

Magic FutureBox is bigger and more flexible than any space in Manhattan - at one quarter of the cost.
An effective and minimal production design.

The majority of our set, lights, costumes and props will be found objects - from Magic FutureBox, our closets and props warehouses.
We will still need to purchase some items - some wood to build a few platforms, some material for costumes, and, of course, glo-tape.  But, our minimalistic production aesthetic means we won't be purchasing much, so we can keep costs down.


What we do use, we will re-use: Your donation will fund several future productions, rather than just this one.
Small stipends for our artists.


Artists are the most sustainable aspect of theatre.  Rather than paying for an elaborate set that will be torn down and thrown away, we will pay our artists so they can come back and make more meaningful art that you want to see.
Your donation will also help us keep ticket prices down to $15, so that our work will be affordable and accessible.
We would be happy to provide you with a detailed breakdown of our budget.  Please e-mail us at villainsperformance@gmail.com.
 
WHY VILLAINS?
We've done this before - we can do it again.

Last time, it was cutting Hamlet down to an hour and performing it for one audience member at a time.  Stand and Unfold Yourself, which premiered at Brown University in 2011, was innovative, gripping, and highly praised by the community.  We are ready to take it to the next level with OCEAN KINGDOM.
Be sure to check out our previous work on our website!
Your donation goes beyond OCEAN KINGDOM.

Your donation will help us get VILLAINS off the ground, jump-starting a unique company with a sustainable model.
We can't do it without you.


This is a fixed funding campaign.  We must raise $5000 by March 4 at midnight, or else we get nothing.  This means we would have to scale down even more, raise our ticket prices and pray that we make up what we spent in the box office - which, as recent college graduates, is an investment none of us can afford to make.
We need YOUR help to fully realize OCEAN KINGDOM, and to get VILLAINS up and running.  We appreciate your support, and we want thank you - Check out our perks on the right!

<p>In 2008, I was contacted by the administration at Saint Paul's School in Harlem. They asked me and a few of my colleagues within the professional theatre industry, if we would do them the huge favor of starting a small after school theater program. It had never been attempted in this specific institution before, but they said the kids were expressing a real interest. Feeling intrigued and moved by the fact that these kids had little to no opportunity to express themselves creatively through theater, we accepted-- asking nothing in return.</p>
<p><b>The program started on a rainy Thursday afternoon</b>. A few shy kids and a handful of concerned parents approached the small stage built into the corner of the gym. What was this new ""theater thing?"" We demonstrated a some theatrical games, and the kids began interacting with each other. Soon their shy expressions turned into laughter and joy, and the parents stopped being concerned and started participating.</p>
<p>A few weeks later the program was up and running. We staged a few Christmas songs and poems at the school's Annual Christmas Party, and. the show was a great success! We immediately began developing the curriculum for the following season, and after that, the program grew and grew--but so did our needs.</p>
<p><b>Today, almost five years later, the number of kids participating in the program has tripled and more are arriving</b>. However, the school continues to experience deep financial trouble and has no additional resources to provide things as simple as costumes or props, or supply the demand for needed teachers. Securing teachers has proved to be especially difficult in today's economy, and it has become increasingly challenging to find teachers who can give of their time <i>for free.</i>  </p>
<p><b>Recently we touched base with a group of exceptional artists and educators who are more then willing to help us fully realize a theater program at St. Paul's, but we still need financial resources</b>. We have found willing designers to help provide performances with set design, costumes, and music. Also, since our performances suffering acoustically from the placement of the theater in the school gym (with its large crowds of parents, relatives, and school teachers), we have located a sound technician who will manage and provide speakers and microphones. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>We're ready!!! But the kids need your help!! </b>Your support will give the kids at St. Paul's the program they deserve with properly staged shows and enough teachers to accept anyone who wants to participate, have fun, and be creative. So far, this little program that started on a rainy Thursday afternoon has helped kids create friendships, fight bullies, work as a team, and rediscover the simple joy of a round of <i>Hide and Seek </i>in the times of tablets and smartphones. </p>

Last year I visited schools in Bali and this last Christmas I delivered toys to orphanages. This year Im going to study in India and bring toys to gift to children in need. My vision is to bring flow and circus arts to kids around the world. I hope to improve the lives of others while working on my own personal growth. With your help, I will bring the dream of creative physical expression to children on the streets, schools, and orphanages of India while traveling from Goa to Rishikesh studying Yoga and meditation.Your contribution creates children's laughter. You support kids shifting their bodies through space as they learn to express themselves through movement with toys such as Hulu-hoops, poi, juggling equipment and other circus props. Your funds teach children how to interact with the world through joyous physicality, dance, and circus arts. Together we create something greater than I could alone!Where I am going? February 14 - I will arrive Goa, spending 10 days working with children from orphanages to the streets.

</h3>My daughter,  Iona Makota, is a 13 year old 8th grader in Houston, Texas.  She started dancing at around 3yrs old in the aisles at my performances.  lol.  She was literally stealing the show at 3!  Dance has always been be her lifelong dream and now she has the
opportunity to study at the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater the summer of 2015. Currently attending The Movement Lab,  under the direction of Kevin Ferguson, Iona has a rigid schedule of Ballet, Modern, Jazz, Improv, Dunham, and Pointe classes. As a little girl she's studied
West African, South African, Brazillian and took Hip Hop classes. A few of her teachers have been
Alseny Soumah, Dandha da Hora, Mabiba Baegne, Dimakatso Hampton, Lauren Anderson, Youssouff Koubassa, Michael Paul Appleman, Mouminatou Camara, Lori Amare and Jennifer Sommers. Dance is very close to her heart, and she hopes to make
it her profession. <br/>
Outside of dance, Iona spends her time dancing.  Yes, dancing.  She also enjoys reading, drumming, roller skating, watching
movies, and listening to music. She's taken flute, violin, marimba and piano lessons,
and hopes to have music accompany her along the way to becoming a better artist. <br/>

still young, since our starting point of only 6 members we can now proudly
boast 20 members and are continuing to see growth and opportunity arise every
day. While gratify has hosted 4 play readings since its establishment, <i>Conscious Inertia</i> well be our first official
production. We are looking to roll in with a bang and with the assistance of a
strong cast, incredible playwright, fantastic director, and an extensive and
powerful artistic team it seems there is only one thing missing: the funds to
make this show a reality. </p><b>What We Need</b><p></p>

is a new play by Brett Evan Solomon that explores the many ways that faith can
be lost and found. A new variation on the biblical flood, it takes place in a
dark and dreary city where it seems that the world is coming to an end. The
city's inhabitants try to figure out what to do when they're standing at what
could be the end of the world. And even if they figure it out, how will they
keep going?Cast:Jared- Christopher SmithLamech- Jonathan Daniel SchenkNoah- Chandon SethiAdair- Caitlin KenyonMary- Meghan RayCrew:Playwright- Brett Evan SolomonDirector- James McDermottAssistant Director- Sebastian Leroy PrayProducer- Caitlin KenyonStage Manager- Rebecca ReinAssistant Stage Manager- Jennifer MatelskiDramaturge- Andrew JonesSet Designer- Brittany BalfourLighting Designer- Ash ZeitlerLighting Team- Nick Sciretta, Kevin DowningSound Designer- Kevin DowningProps Master- Carson Polan-VolpeCostume Designer- Jessica DeMartino Costuming Team- Iliana Paris, Marissa MartinChoreographer- Arden WinantMake-Up Artist- Beth PhelanFront of House- Laurie KingPosters- Lynne BarcenasTell Me More...Hello and welcome! My name is Caitlin Kenyon and I am both the Producer and playing the role of Adair in Gratify Theatre Works production of Conscious Inertia. I am currently a Junior at Purchase College double majoring in Theater and Performance and Arts Management. But enough about me, let’s
get to the important people here.Gratify Theatre Works is a collective of theatre makers who
began their journey at Purchase College. We are a group of artists who took a
look at the opportunities for young adults with theatre degrees and concluded that
our best chance of moving forward was to pave our own path. While Gratify is
still young, since our starting point of only 6 members we can now proudly
boast 20 members and are continuing to see growth and opportunity arise every
day. While gratify has hosted 4 play readings since its establishment, Conscious Inertia well be our first official
production. We are looking to roll in with a bang and with the assistance of a
strong cast, incredible playwright, fantastic director, and an extensive and
powerful artistic team it seems there is only one thing missing: the funds to
make this show a reality. What We Need

<p><b><i>Qui sommes-nous?</i></b></p>
<p>Les Productions du Sixième Art sont constituées de jeunes professionnels
qui partagent une passion pour les arts de la scène, plus particulièrement pour
la comédie musicale. Composée de musiciens, de chanteurs, de danseurs,  de
comédiens et d’acteurs culturels, l’équipe de production se veut innovatrice en
offrant aux Québécois la chance de découvrir et d’apprécier cet art plutôt
méconnu, en produisant complètement en français. Tout ceci dans le but de
perdurer à travers les années et de permettre à plusieurs générations
d’artistes de se produire sur la scène québécoise.</p>
<p><b><i>Mission</i></b></p>
<p>— Faire rayonner et rendre accessible la comédie musicale dans la ville
de Québec, en offrant à ses habitants la possibilité de découvrir de grandes
productions de partout à travers le monde, entièrement adaptées en français;</p>
<p>— Offrir un tremplin à de jeunes professionnels du milieu des arts de la
scène, accomplis ou en devenir, en leur offrant une expérience concrète et
enrichissante encadrée par des professionnels expérimentés du milieu;</p>
<p>— Encourager le développement et l’accomplissement professionnel en
stimulant l’emploi dans le milieu des arts et de la culture, et ce, dans
différents domaines tels que le théâtre, le chant, la danse, la musique, la
mise en scène, la production et autres.</p>
<p><b>Le Chanteur de noces</b></p>
<p><b><i>Résumé</i></b></p>
<p>Robbie, jeune chanteur et musicien, fait carrière en tant que chanteur
de noces. En peine d’amour, il se lie d’amitié avec Julia, une collègue de
travail pour qui il développera des sentiments amoureux au cours de la pièce.
Malheureusement, l’élue de son cœur est déjà fiancée à un jeune homme riche et
ambitieux. Robbie tentera donc de conquérir le cœur de Julia et de la
convaincre qu’il est bel et bien l’homme de sa vie.</p>
<p>
</p><p><b><span>Ce dont nous avons besoin</span></b></p>
<p>Il nous manque encore 1000 $ pour payer la location des équipements

demande beaucoup d’éléments. Grâce à vous, nous pourrons vous en mettre plein
la vue avec de l’équipement de qualité et un visuel à vous couper le souffle!

</p><p><b><span>Votre impact</span></b></p>
<p>Grâce à ce tout premier projet, les Productions du Sixième Art comptent
s’implanter à long terme dans le monde des arts de la scène à Québec. Cette production
n’est que le début d’une aventure où pourront participer chaque année une
vingtaine d’artistes amateurs et près d’une dizaine de professionnels du milieu

</div>","Qui sommes-nous?
Les Productions du Sixième Art sont constituées de jeunes professionnels
qui partagent une passion pour les arts de la scène, plus particulièrement pour
la comédie musicale. Composée de musiciens, de chanteurs, de danseurs,  de
comédiens et d’acteurs culturels, l’équipe de production se veut innovatrice en
offrant aux Québécois la chance de découvrir et d’apprécier cet art plutôt
méconnu, en produisant complètement en français. Tout ceci dans le but de
perdurer à travers les années et de permettre à plusieurs générations
d’artistes de se produire sur la scène québécoise.
Mission
— Faire rayonner et rendre accessible la comédie musicale dans la ville
de Québec, en offrant à ses habitants la possibilité de découvrir de grandes
productions de partout à travers le monde, entièrement adaptées en français;
— Offrir un tremplin à de jeunes professionnels du milieu des arts de la
scène, accomplis ou en devenir, en leur offrant une expérience concrète et
enrichissante encadrée par des professionnels expérimentés du milieu;
— Encourager le développement et l’accomplissement professionnel en
stimulant l’emploi dans le milieu des arts et de la culture, et ce, dans
différents domaines tels que le théâtre, le chant, la danse, la musique, la
mise en scène, la production et autres.
Le Chanteur de noces
Résumé
Robbie, jeune chanteur et musicien, fait carrière en tant que chanteur
de noces. En peine d’amour, il se lie d’amitié avec Julia, une collègue de
travail pour qui il développera des sentiments amoureux au cours de la pièce.
Malheureusement, l’élue de son cœur est déjà fiancée à un jeune homme riche et
ambitieux. Robbie tentera donc de conquérir le cœur de Julia et de la
convaincre qu’il est bel et bien l’homme de sa vie.

Ce dont nous avons besoin
Il nous manque encore 1000 $ pour payer la location des équipements
techniques et nos décors et costumes. C’est une production d’envergure qui
demande beaucoup d’éléments. Grâce à vous, nous pourrons vous en mettre plein
la vue avec de l’équipement de qualité et un visuel à vous couper le souffle!

Votre impact
Grâce à ce tout premier projet, les Productions du Sixième Art comptent
s’implanter à long terme dans le monde des arts de la scène à Québec. Cette production
n’est que le début d’une aventure où pourront participer chaque année une
vingtaine d’artistes amateurs et près d’une dizaine de professionnels du milieu
des arts et de la culture. En plus d’offrir un tremplin à ces jeunes artistes
et professionnels, nous offrons aussi en primeur à tous les habitants de la
Capitale la possibilité de voir de grandes comédies musicales de partout à
travers le monde entièrement adaptées en français. Et tout cela grâce à vous!

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Every season Thespionage solicits plays from local writers and all submissions are read and considered by our team.

<p>In the spirit of making theatre accessible and supporting local talent, Thespionage also plans to reach the community by broadcasting live performances and posting recordings and short video sketches online.

<p>The Aeneid Theatre Company is a new student theatre company devoted to independently producing upstanding non-musical plays at USC.  We are absolutely thrilled to kick off our second season with Peter Shaffer's <i>Equus</i>. </p>
<p><i>What's that?</i></p>
<p><i>Equus</i> is one of the late Peter Shaffer's most well-known plays, along with <i>Amadeus</i>, and shares an account of a brilliant psychiatrist's attempt to treat a 17 year-old boy who has blinded six horses with a metal spike. This whirlwind of a piece of theatre deals with the psychiatrist's doubts about his profession and common conventions of ""normalcy"" that he contends with as he delves further and further into the mind of a disturbed youth. As the audience delves further and further into the mystery of the boy's motivations, a heinous and incomprehensible act becomes one with a little more clarity, and we are forced to ask ourselves what it means to ""treat"" someone and whether or not the small defense mechanisms and insecurities of every day, mundane life may not be so different from those afflicting the ""diseased.""</p>
<p><i>So what's the Indiegogo page for?</i></p>

<h3>The Harvest</h3>
<h2>
</h2>
<p>DUELS will be produced by amador/stokes at 12th Ave Arts in Seattle for four weekends, Aug 18 - Sep 11, 2016. The play will feature the acting talents of Marianna de Fazio, Daniel Christensen, and Carter Rodriquez, the direction of José Amador, and the writing of Nick Stokes.</p>
<p>Our experienced team includes Craig Bradshaw (co-producer), Amy LaZerte (costume design), Tess Malone (light design), Michael James Adam (sound design), Silas James (scene design), and more to come.<br/></p>
<p>In the surreally absurd tragedy DUELS, Irene gardens and lives with John and Juan killing
each other again and again and again. <br/></p>
<p>DUELS bleeds
vegetable juice, smashes tomatoes, smears blackberries, and recedes from
suburban now to rural then, when John was Irene’s investor husband, Juan
was her Latino gardener, and the shooting began.</p>
<p>DUELS speaks Spanish and English, like many people.</p>
<p>DUELS will use as much produce from Stokes's and the team's garden as is possible. We are gardening for art. <br/></p>
<p>[Both Aimée and Kasia have had to step away from the production, but we are thrilled to welcome Marianna and Silas!]<br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Seeds</h3>
<p>With our current team, amador/stokes produced a twenty-minute chunk of 
DUELS (Orange) at On the Boards Northwest New Works Festival 2013. Building 
from that experience to a full production has been the goal from the 
beginning, and DUELS is about to come to fruition. We got our hands dirty, loved, brandished carrots, and died. Now we dig deeper.<br/></p>
<p>Both Amador and Stokes have successfully produced their work in the not-so-distant past, Amador 
especially with his solo performances such as the multiple incarnations 
of ""El Hijo Prodigo"" and Stokes with his plays ""The Sound We Make"" and 
""Whiteout"" at Old City Hall in Tacoma. <br/></p>
<p>DUELS has also received staged readings with Northwest Playwrights Alliance at Seattle Rep and at the erstwhile Open Circle Theater. The first draft of DUELS was written in 2008 while Stokes was in residence at Artist Trust's Camano Island Residency. Many people have worked to make it what it will be.</p>
<p> </p>
</div> <div> <p>We are asking you, too, to help us make it happen.</p>

<h3>The Hands

</h3>
<p>José
Amador is an actor, director and writer of plays, sketch, screenplays along
with various musings on the Arts. The latter could be read in the digital pages
of The Seattle Star, a reader-supported online journal for which he is a
co-founder, contributor and editor. In 2014 at Annex Theater, he directed ""Black Like Us"" by Rachel Atkins, which won the Gregory Award for New Play.<br/></p>
<p>Nick
Stokes writes plays, fictions, nothings, arrangements, pieces of prose, 
and
others. He is the author of the novel Affair. Among other explorations, 
he recently completed an immersive anti-choose-your-own-adventure
novel. He's been making theater in the PNW since 
2006; sometimes he packs mules in the wilderness of Montana; he's sorta at nickstokes.net.</p>
<p>Marianna de Fazio was a 3-year 
company member of The International Theatre Vienna, before moving to 
Seattle. She received her MFA from the University 
of Washington’s Professional Actor Training Program. Because of her 
time abroad, Marianna speaks German and incorporates her love of other 
culture, travel and language into her acting, voice work and accent 
coaching. (<a href=""http://www.mariannadefazio.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.mariannadefazio.com</a>)<br/></p>

</div></div>","The Harvest


DUELS will be produced by amador/stokes at 12th Ave Arts in Seattle for four weekends, Aug 18 - Sep 11, 2016. The play will feature the acting talents of Marianna de Fazio, Daniel Christensen, and Carter Rodriquez, the direction of José Amador, and the writing of Nick Stokes.
Our experienced team includes Craig Bradshaw (co-producer), Amy LaZerte (costume design), Tess Malone (light design), Michael James Adam (sound design), Silas James (scene design), and more to come.
In the surreally absurd tragedy DUELS, Irene gardens and lives with John and Juan killing
each other again and again and again. 
DUELS bleeds
vegetable juice, smashes tomatoes, smears blackberries, and recedes from
suburban now to rural then, when John was Irene’s investor husband, Juan
was her Latino gardener, and the shooting began.
DUELS speaks Spanish and English, like many people.
DUELS will use as much produce from Stokes's and the team's garden as is possible. We are gardening for art. 
[Both Aimée and Kasia have had to step away from the production, but we are thrilled to welcome Marianna and Silas!]

The Seeds
With our current team, amador/stokes produced a twenty-minute chunk of 
DUELS (Orange) at On the Boards Northwest New Works Festival 2013. Building 
from that experience to a full production has been the goal from the 
beginning, and DUELS is about to come to fruition. We got our hands dirty, loved, brandished carrots, and died. Now we dig deeper.
Both Amador and Stokes have successfully produced their work in the not-so-distant past, Amador 
especially with his solo performances such as the multiple incarnations 
of ""El Hijo Prodigo"" and Stokes with his plays ""The Sound We Make"" and 
""Whiteout"" at Old City Hall in Tacoma. 
DUELS has also received staged readings with Northwest Playwrights Alliance at Seattle Rep and at the erstwhile Open Circle Theater. The first draft of DUELS was written in 2008 while Stokes was in residence at Artist Trust's Camano Island Residency. Many people have worked to make it what it will be.
 
  We are asking you, too, to help us make it happen.

The Hands


José
Amador is an actor, director and writer of plays, sketch, screenplays along
with various musings on the Arts. The latter could be read in the digital pages
of The Seattle Star, a reader-supported online journal for which he is a
co-founder, contributor and editor. In 2014 at Annex Theater, he directed ""Black Like Us"" by Rachel Atkins, which won the Gregory Award for New Play.
Nick
Stokes writes plays, fictions, nothings, arrangements, pieces of prose, 
and
others. He is the author of the novel Affair. Among other explorations, 
he recently completed an immersive anti-choose-your-own-adventure
novel. He's been making theater in the PNW since 
2006; sometimes he packs mules in the wilderness of Montana; he's sorta at nickstokes.net.
Marianna de Fazio was a 3-year 
company member of The International Theatre Vienna, before moving to 
Seattle. She received her MFA from the University 
of Washington’s Professional Actor Training Program. Because of her 
time abroad, Marianna speaks German and incorporates her love of other 
culture, travel and language into her acting, voice work and accent 
coaching. (www.mariannadefazio.com)
Daniel Christensen is just so very

</div></div>","Who Are We?We are Singles Awareness Productions. Founded in Victoria, Canada, we have spread our wings and are now traveling the world! Currently situated in Melbourne, this year we are bringing our 5th Fringe show to the Adelaide Fringe. About the Project:Art of the Eight Limbs 
Written by award winning Canadian playwright Kat Taddei. Directed by renowned Canadian theatre artist Blair Moro. Featuring Australians Emily Jackson and Timothy Smith, and Canadian Stephanie Nikolaidis. Art of the Eight Limbs is a whirlwind piece of theatre: three different eccentrics are torn out of their comfort zones and thrust into a bizarre chain of causally-related events. The piece seeks to find the humanity in even the most absurd of realities. For more information about our creative team, check out the bios at the bottom! What We Need
Adelaide Fringe is the SECOND BIGGEST Fringe Festival in the WORLD. We are raising money to pay for the marketing costs of this wonderful festival.
If we make it to our goal of $1000, we will be able to buy TWO quarter page slots in local fringe guides, which are seen by massive amounts of visitors to the Adelaide Fringe (2 million last year!).We will be out marketing/sprooking every night of the festival, but we can't reach everyone. Being able to purchase these ad spaces will help us reach people who never would have heard of our show beforehand. This is particularly important to us as an international company; we don't have the advantage of being established here in Adelaide. Thank you all! Blair MoroSingles Awareness Productions#8Limbs #ADLFringe @SingleAwareProdThe Writer: Kat TaddeiKat
 is a writer, stage manager and performer, wrapping up her fourth and 
final year in the University of Victoria's Creative Writing program. 
Before she had even memorized the alphabet, Kat would wander around the 
house ""reading"" aloud from her mother's Agatha Christie novels (really, 
just making up stories as she went along). Kat's
 plays have been produced for Langham Court's ACTivate Festival, 
Epiphany Theatre's Interplay Festival, UVic's Student Alternative 
Theatre Company, and Intrepid's brand new queer theatre festival, 
OUTstages. Most recently, her show Two
 was awarded Favourite New Play at the 2015 Victoria Fringe Festival. 
Kat is thrilled to make her international debut as a playwright with Art of the Eight Limbs, especially under the direction of her long-lost friend (and first year 'big buddy' at the Phoenix Theatre), Blair Moro.

</div><h3>ABOUT THE
SHOW: A GROUNDBREAKING PRODUCTION!</h3>
<p><i>Icarus Rising<span>,</span></i> a new dance opera, is an exploration of the story of one man’s attempt to enlighten people about
the beauty of freedom. Based on a true story of Lauro de Bosis, an anti-fascist
poet, and American actress Ruth Draper, his love and champion, the opera will
feature choreography/direction by <b>Sabatino Verlezza</b> and <b>Loretta Fois</b>, music composition by <b>Elliot Sokolov</b> and libretto by <b>Isidore Elias</b>, and will premiere at The Nash Theatre,
Somerville, NJ in December 2015.</p>

<h3>ABOUT THE
CREATORS: A FAB FOURSOME!</h3>
<p>What brought these
four artists together? All four are strongly attracted to the story of Lauro
and Ruth…to its love, passion and call to action. It’s time to bring these four together to make something new!</p>
<p>While all four of the show's creators are New
York/New Jersey artists that have partnered with each other on numerous projects,
this project is the first time they have joined as a team! </p>
<p>Our partnership encompasses
music, dance and theatre and brings together the worlds of professional artists,
college students and community members. </p><p><br/></p>
<h3><span>WHAT WE’RE DOING</span></h3>
<p>What
does it take to make a dance opera? In this case it takes 17 dancers, 10
singers, 2 choreographer/directors, 1 composer, 1 librettist, 1 set and costume
designer, and your support! </p>
<p>In
January 2015, Verlezza Dance was awarded a grant from the O’Donnell Green Music
and Dance Foundation to compose and choreograph new opera, and in May we were awarded
a small grant from Somerset County Cultural and Heritage Commission.</p>
<p>After
assembling an awesome and talented cast, we workshoped three scenes of the
opera at The Nash Theatre in April 2015. </p>
<p>During the summer we auditioned more
dancers, members of Caritas Chamber Chorale
joined our cast as vocalists, and we began the rehearsal process. </p>
<p>Our
cast continues rehearsals during the fall season, getting ready for the opera
premiere on December 1<sup>st</sup> &amp; 2<sup>nd</sup> at the Nash Theatre, Raritan
Valley Community College, Somerville, NJ. </p>

four artists together? All four are strongly attracted to the story of Lauro
and Ruth…to its love, passion and call to action. It’s time to bring these four together to make something new!
While all four of the show's creators are New
York/New Jersey artists that have partnered with each other on numerous projects,
this project is the first time they have joined as a team! 
Our partnership encompasses
music, dance and theatre and brings together the worlds of professional artists,
college students and community members. 
WHAT WE’RE DOING
What
does it take to make a dance opera? In this case it takes 17 dancers, 10
singers, 2 choreographer/directors, 1 composer, 1 librettist, 1 set and costume
designer, and your support! 
In
January 2015, Verlezza Dance was awarded a grant from the O’Donnell Green Music
and Dance Foundation to compose and choreograph new opera, and in May we were awarded
a small grant from Somerset County Cultural and Heritage Commission.
After
assembling an awesome and talented cast, we workshoped three scenes of the
opera at The Nash Theatre in April 2015. 
During the summer we auditioned more
dancers, members of Caritas Chamber Chorale
joined our cast as vocalists, and we began the rehearsal process. 
Our
cast continues rehearsals during the fall season, getting ready for the opera
premiere on December 1st & 2nd at the Nash Theatre, Raritan
Valley Community College, Somerville, NJ. 
WHAT YOU
CAN DO

Your funds
will help produce an overall more immersive
theatrical experience; providing original costumes, set design, and props. Most
importantly, your generosity goes directly to artist fees for the dancers and
singers for all their hard work, dedication and artistry. These artists have given their time and
talent to the belief in this work and have trusted the process of creating
something from nothing…a new work of art!
Spread the word by sharing
our campaign with anyone who would be interested in our mission on Facebook,
Instagram, and Indiegogo.

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p><i>Pop Punk High </i>is a new musical written by and for everyone who grew up singing and screaming along to blink-182, Sum 41, Green Day, Good Charlotte, Fall Out Boy, Dashboard Confessional, Taking Back Sunday, Jimmy Eat World, and so many more angsty, angsty pop punk bands of the early to mid 2000’s. Somewhere in between parody and loving tribute with a big dose of nostalgia.</p>
<p><i>Pop Punk High</i> is a takedown of your favorite high school movies and music of yesteryear, but it’s so much more than that – it’s an exploration of the ridiculous tropes and prevailing mindsets that dominated so much of the pop punk landscape, and seeks to understand why amazing female-identifying pop punk performers like Hayley Williams and Laura Jane Grace are often downplayed or forgotten. It’s an incisive critique of the absurd depths of masculinity and “not giving a fuck” that pop punk performers tried to model, and how those attitudes informed a whole generation of listeners. And it’s also the only musical in the world featuring the singing ghost of Avril Lavigne.</p>
<p><a href=""https://soundcloud.com/poppunkhigh/mylifesucks"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">CLICK HERE TO HEAR THE TRACK ""MY LIFE SUCKS""</a> performed by Ben Lapidus in <i>Pop Punk High</i>.</p>
<p>What are people saying about Pop Punk High? Here are some snippets from our reviews of our previous run at the PIT Loft:</p> <p>“Musically, the show hits the parody nail directly on the head. If the lyrics weren't so damned funny, you could easily mistake these tracks for an actual Blink 182 album.”</p> <p>“What Cook and his crew have created here is explosively good.”</p> <p>“I left this show and immediately wanted to watch it again.”</p> <p>“[The] one-liners are savage, [the] dialogue is to both kill and die for, and [the] understanding of the pop-punk milieu is doctorate grade. I haven't laughed this much at <a href=""https://thepit-nyc.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">the PIT </a>since the first time I saw <a href=""https://www.puffstheplay.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>Puffs</i></a> there… and look where that show ended up.”</p>

</div></div>","Overview
Pop Punk High is a new musical written by and for everyone who grew up singing and screaming along to blink-182, Sum 41, Green Day, Good Charlotte, Fall Out Boy, Dashboard Confessional, Taking Back Sunday, Jimmy Eat World, and so many more angsty, angsty pop punk bands of the early to mid 2000’s. Somewhere in between parody and loving tribute with a big dose of nostalgia.
Pop Punk High is a takedown of your favorite high school movies and music of yesteryear, but it’s so much more than that – it’s an exploration of the ridiculous tropes and prevailing mindsets that dominated so much of the pop punk landscape, and seeks to understand why amazing female-identifying pop punk performers like Hayley Williams and Laura Jane Grace are often downplayed or forgotten. It’s an incisive critique of the absurd depths of masculinity and “not giving a fuck” that pop punk performers tried to model, and how those attitudes informed a whole generation of listeners. And it’s also the only musical in the world featuring the singing ghost of Avril Lavigne.
CLICK HERE TO HEAR THE TRACK ""MY LIFE SUCKS"" performed by Ben Lapidus in Pop Punk High.
What are people saying about Pop Punk High? Here are some snippets from our reviews of our previous run at the PIT Loft: “Musically, the show hits the parody nail directly on the head. If the lyrics weren't so damned funny, you could easily mistake these tracks for an actual Blink 182 album.” “What Cook and his crew have created here is explosively good.” “I left this show and immediately wanted to watch it again.” “[The] one-liners are savage, [the] dialogue is to both kill and die for, and [the] understanding of the pop-punk milieu is doctorate grade. I haven't laughed this much at the PIT since the first time I saw Puffs there… and look where that show ended up.”
All quotes from Thomas Burns Scully writing for Popdust.

</div></div>","Who is  The New Renaissance Theatre Company, and what is The Unrehearsed Shakespeare Project?

The New Renaissance Theatre Company is a 501(c)(3) non-profit whose mission is to illuminate the joy and passion captured in the best of live theatre by connecting the classic to the contemporary through ensemble-based development and performance.It is our goal to create an artistic home for an ensemble of actors and theatre craftsmen. It all begins with The Unrehearsed Shakespeare Project.
USP is dedicated to performing the works of William Shakespeare using the unrehearsed cue script technique in order to expose our community to unique productions that bring the audience and performers together in a way that only theatre can. The unrehearsed cue script technique is based upon the working conditions of Shakespeare's own company, our research and our experience in performing and producing plays using this historically informed practice.


For the past two years, we have toured single productions to parks around the Pittsburgh area, where communities do not always have easy access to quality, free, professional live theatre. This year we are expanding our tour to include two free plays and we are adding at least two new venues!Announcing our cast for

<div><div><div>This exhilarating multimedia showcase highlights the lives and gifts of Katherine Dunham and Paul Robeson. A truly original theatrical experience for Black History month 2017 created and produced by four collaborating independent artists committed to progressive political theater. The creative team includes Chiquita Camille (Katherine Dunham), Julius Hollingsworth (Paul Robeson), Robert Gonzalez (stage manger), and Rico Speight (producer/director/writer). We have worked together before on previous Off Broadway productions, and in this campaign, we have decided to take destiny into our own hands and do something crazy (in a good way)!  In this campaign we are reaching out to family, friends and comrades for support to make this idea come alive. We have an amazing location with its own significant pedigree: the Gene Frankel Theatre (GFT) in New York’s East Village has a history of political theatrical performances. Established in 1949 by actor/director Gene Frankel, the GFT premiered Jean Genet's ""The Blacks"" in New York in 1961 starring James Earl Jones and Cicely Tyson.</div></div></div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<p><strong><u>What We NEED : </u></strong></p>
<p>Our immediate goal is $14,000 to pay upfront expenses to mount the play for one week in February 2017.  We are working on a shoe-string budget and whatever we raise in this campaign will pay for sets, lights, costumes, audio-visuals, music, actors’ salaries, fees for the creative team, and publicity. We have already raised $5,000 to pay for the theater. </p>

<p>This music and drama is inspired by the true story of Sadako Sasaki.  Sadako, a young Japanese girl, died of leukemia at the age of 12 as a direct result of the atom bomb.  This disease was known in Japan as the atom bomb disease.  She had a dream... to make 1000 Golden Paper Cranes.  Ancient Japanese legend contends whoever folds one thousand origami cranes, will be granted a wish by the gods.  Sadako's wish... to live.  At the time of her death, she had folded 644 cranes.  Her family and friends folded the remainder to make 1000 origami cranes.  Sadako was buried with them.</p>
<p>The script is written by Emiko Iinuma, Founder and President of the Harmonia Opera Company, and the music is provided by Ric Cherwin, Kuni Mikami, and Tsubasa Matsuda.  This opera has been created for the goal of WORLD PEACE AND LOVE.  It is my dream to launch the World Premiere of ""ECHOES OF THOUSAND CRANES"" in honor of my family. After this world premiere, it is my hope this story will be told as a future production on Broadway, and all over the world.</p>
<p>All funds will be used for production costs.</p>
<p>I will be very grateful if you would help us.  Thank you and I hope you will be a part of the World Premiere of ""ECHOES OF THOUSAND CRANES"".</p>

This music and drama is inspired by the true story of Sadako Sasaki.  Sadako, a young Japanese girl, died of leukemia at the age of 12 as a direct result of the atom bomb.  This disease was known in Japan as the atom bomb disease.  She had a dream... to make 1000 Golden Paper Cranes.  Ancient Japanese legend contends whoever folds one thousand origami cranes, will be granted a wish by the gods.  Sadako's wish... to live.  At the time of her death, she had folded 644 cranes.  Her family and friends folded the remainder to make 1000 origami cranes.  Sadako was buried with them.
The script is written by Emiko Iinuma, Founder and President of the Harmonia Opera Company, and the music is provided by Ric Cherwin, Kuni Mikami, and Tsubasa Matsuda.  This opera has been created for the goal of WORLD PEACE AND LOVE.  It is my dream to launch the World Premiere of ""ECHOES OF THOUSAND CRANES"" in honor of my family. After this world premiere, it is my hope this story will be told as a future production on Broadway, and all over the world.
All funds will be used for production costs.
I will be very grateful if you would help us.  Thank you and I hope you will be a part of the World Premiere of ""ECHOES OF THOUSAND CRANES"".

Your contributions, Tweets, Tumblr posts, LiveJournal entries, and other forms of support has been phenomenal, and I am deeply touched by how much this project means to you.If you'd like to donate but ran out of time, you still have a chance. Just click on this link to contribute directly via the Fractured Atlas website.I look forward to sharing news and updates for Tulpa, or Anne&Me in 2012. For now, please enjoy the I Am Theatre video I made with Theatre Communications Group (TCG) by heading over to the Gallery tab.Thank you so, so much.
Part whimsical fantasy, part realist drama, part gothic horror, Tulpa, or Anne&Me tells the story of a lonely artist whose world gets turned upside down when Anne Hathaway crawls out of her TV. As their friendship blossoms, they examine how race impacts the way they understand and relate to each other. At the same time, they struggle to connect across racial barriers to find out who they can really be to one another.



WHY TULPA, OR ANNE&ME?
Earlier this year, I wrote and produced a play called Tulpa, or Anne&Me that debuted at the Planet Connections Theatre Festivity.


Since that first production, friends, family, fellow artists, and audience members have talked about how much Tulpa means to them and asked about whatï¿½s next for Tulpa, or Anne&Me. As an artist, it's wonderful to see how something you created has touched people in deep places and led to powerful moments of growth and healing. I feel a real responsibility to take this piece as far as I can and bring it to as many places as I can where people want and need to see it.

I am raising $3,000 to cover production expenses for the 2012 performance of Tulpa, or Anne&Me in mid-late April 2012. If only 60 people contribute just $50 each, I can reach that goal. If only 60 people contribute just $50 each, Tulpa, or Anne&Me will have another chance to do what it's meant to do -- pave the way for healing and transformation in our lives, relationships, and communities. But no matter how much you choose to give, you will be doing more than putting a story on a stage . . . you will be creating an opportunity to honor of those of us whose lives have been and will be touched by Tulpa, or Anne&Me.

When you make a secure, tax-deductible donation to this project, you will receive a perk depending on the amount you contribute. You can donate it all at once or spread it out over several contributions. It's all based on the total amount you give.

WHERE DOES THE MONEY GO?

Your generous contribution will go toward production expenses for the April 2012 production of Tulpa, or Anne&Me. This includes things like:


paying a stipend to cast and crew
renting rehearsal space
printing scripts for the cast and crew
purchasing materials for the set
buying or renting props and costumes


marketing, publicity, and advertising
a little money set aside for emergency purchases


HOW DID TULPA, OR ANNE&ME GET HERE?

Tulpa, or Anne&Me began as a mental exercise on LiveJournal that tried to imagine new ways to talk about race. What began as snippets of dialogue evolved into a story that soon became a full-length play. The first draft led to a reading at the Cell Theatre's Blackboard Play Reading series, followed by 2 staged readings at WOW Cafe Theater. A brief encounter with Anne Hathaway and a staged reading later, Tulpa, or Anne&Me has made its debut at the Planet Connections Theatre Festivity.

Will you make a contribution and be part of Tulpa's story?

<p class=""MsoNormal"">From 2009 to 2012, Rajni Shah Projects are creating <em>Glorious</em><span style=""font-weight: normal; font-style: normal;""> - a haunting and unusual new musical that will be completely reinvented for every location, as members of the local community and local musicians work with Rajni and her collaborators to create each event.</span></p>

MakingGlorious

From 2009 to 2012, Rajni Shah Projects are creating Glorious - a haunting and unusual new musical that will be completely reinvented for every location, as members of the local community and local musicians work with Rajni and her collaborators to create each event.
As part of this project composers Ben and Max Ringham are creating a musical songbook – a completely new musical score that will be freshly arranged with musical director Suzie Shrubb for local musicians at each location, effectively being re-imagined for each show as Glorious travels across the UK and Europe.
In the meantime, costume designer Lucille Acevedo-Jones is building an intricate and visually awesome costume, incorporating movement and light, and that will quite literally root into the stage.
And throughout the whole process – as we work with local people and local musicians at each location – writer Mary Paterson will be collecting thoughts, souvenirs, images and memories to create the Glorious Storybook, a beautiful professionally-made book creatively documenting the entire Glorious journey.

Why this feels important
 
We’re so excited about this project - and hope you will be too. Glorious is a response to what we’re all feeling these days - fear about the future, a sense that we can’t make a difference, and a horrible feeling that we’ve really screwed up the world once and for all.
Through making Glorious, we wanted to create something really beautiful that a lot of people can be involved with - something that embraces that sense of an unknown future, and that exposes both the fear and the hope of the journey we are making right now as a society. 
Gloriouswill be a musical that is defined by the stories of the people who have made it - not just Rajni and her collaborators, but new local musicians and performers who will take part and reshape it each time it's performed. And you can be involved too!

What you can do to help make Glorious great!
With your help we hope to raise funds to complete the music by the preview performance of Glorious on February 26th 2011 as part of NottDance in Nottingham. Glorious will then premiere at the Barbican in London as part of Spill Festival in April 2011, before travelling to eight other UK and European locations until October 2012. Your donation means that Glorious will impact on the greatest number of people, both musicians and residents in each place we perform, as well as our online network of support that makes it possible for people to stay in touch with the project even when we're not in town.
Your support will not only help us create Glorious, but will also make you part of the Glorious community both figuratively and literally – as you gain access to our Glorious People social network where you can watch the making process unfold and contribute your own ideas. If you’re very, very supportive you can even be named in a song! Take a look at the perks on the right for more information.

<p></p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Obstacles </h3>
<p> A Haunted House usually takes 3-4 years to show a profit, as 
the budget for the first two years are tied up in equipment, set building 
and venue costs.  We have taken steps to ensure that monies raised will 
be used prudently and wisely. <br/></p>
<ul>
<li>Our design and creative team actively share resources and utilize those for the needs of the operation.</li>
<li>The minions are THAT passionate and committed to the vision that Alan and the team have, they all agree on the deferred/low/slow compensation concept for their efforts, as it frees up much needed capital for more important things, like building the haunt and getting event insurance.  <br/>
</li>
<li>Through our networks. we have obtained equipment and supplies for free or
 minimal cost, rather than purchasing outright or renting equipment.</li>
<li>Finally, MEC has given us the space to use to build the haunt, free 
of charge, and is assisting with some support staff and most 
importantly, marketing through their existing media network.</li>

As Orlando is a Film/TV/Theatre school hub, the funding we get will help us hire and pay Student Interns, who will be getting real world experience that they won't necessarily get in class.
 
  


Risks & Obstacles 
 A Haunted House usually takes 3-4 years to show a profit, as 
the budget for the first two years are tied up in equipment, set building 
and venue costs.  We have taken steps to ensure that monies raised will 
be used prudently and wisely. 

Our design and creative team actively share resources and utilize those for the needs of the operation.
The minions are THAT passionate and committed to the vision that Alan and the team have, they all agree on the deferred/low/slow compensation concept for their efforts, as it frees up much needed capital for more important things, like building the haunt and getting event insurance.  

Through our networks. we have obtained equipment and supplies for free or
 minimal cost, rather than purchasing outright or renting equipment.
Finally, MEC has given us the space to use to build the haunt, free 
of charge, and is assisting with some support staff and most 
importantly, marketing through their existing media network.

To put it in perspective:$1 can get us 100 old-school type flyers (black on basic copy paper)$5 can get us postage to mail 13 promo postcards, a roll of duct tape, or a bag of hot glue sticks.$10 pays for a box of nails, a gallon of cheap paint, or 3 cases of water to keep the scare actors hydrated for the night.$20 pays for a sheet of plywood, or 11 yards of erosion cloth.$25 pays for printing up tickets or a small fire extinguisher.$30 can get us 1000 promo postcards printed up.$50 can help us get snacks to keep the scare actors, the tech crew and the staff going throughout the night.$100 can get us a basic makeup kit for one makeup artist for the whole month of October or a very basic low-tech CCTV system.$250 can help us get 5 gallons of flame retardant that we have to spray everything in the house to comply with fire codes.$500 can help us air a commercial on a non-premium channel for a week.$1000 can get us a fog machine.$5000 can help us pay for liability insurance for the entire run of the house.

  Other Ways You Can Help We understand that people may not be able to afford to give to our pursuit of terror, but here's other ways you can help: 
Get the word out and make some noise about our campaign, via relevant social media (ie Facebook and Twitter).
 Don't forget to use the Indiegogo share tools!
And if you want to be personally involved, please let us know! We can use volunteers for things like set building/buildout, support staff, and whatever the spirits think we need. 
 The Majestic....  A once noble and regal establishment where all the 
world's elite would gather.  Now, it's a home to a gathering of another 
kind -- Spirits, Evil, Dementia and Madness!!!  Many a person's worst 
nightmares and fears,       WAITING FOR YOU!WE appreciate your help in bringing Terror back to Orlando in the form of Nightmares at the Majestic.A full prospectus is available upon request by emailing info@gonightmares.com.  Please provide mailing address.Visit us at:  gonightmares.com Facebook:  Nightmares at the MajesticTwitter:  NightmaresHaunt",7.0,0,"1 Campaign

This play has a great history already, with story and music written in 1999ish by three friends; myself, Jennifer Schanke Ragland, and Christina Cass Catton.</p><p>Those beauties migrated South and sprouted families, meanwhile I wrote another rock musical called ""Cube Rat"" which was workshopped in NYC and at Edinburgh Fringe. Then I got cast in another Rock Musical called ""MoM"" which won the NY fringe. and another original musical, Zoe Lewis's ""Across The Pond!""</p><p>It wasn't until just last Fall, Margaret Van Sant inspired me to pull this baby, ""Prom Queens"" off mothballs for the Women's International Theater Festival. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">We only did a reading, but there was momentum, Patty DeLuca came on board to produce, she was not gonna let this thing fade back into the horizon.

<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Our love and genuine appreciation, self esteem from being of service to happy hard working artists who are bringing joy to the world, kisses on your cheek, people who'll visit you when you're old. </p>
<p>Oh and Money! Lots and lots of money if you have the vision to support us at this level before we're massive. It's like getting in on the ground floor of Starbucks.</p>

<h3>What happens if we don't make our financial goal, where does the money go?</h3>If we don't make our goal, we're doing the show anyway. We may just look a little ragged from exhaustion, costumes from the methodist church swap shop, and our shot at Broadway could take a little longer as we couldn't get the producers here. We'll be hitting you up again in a few months when we need money to take the show to them in NY. Probably more expensive, so. Might as well jump in now is what I'm saying.<p></p>

<p></p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p></p>
<p>Broadway is one of the highest risk investments out there. It's also got the greatest potential for return on investment. If a show hits it's possible to make a thousand times or more on one's initial investment. But let's be perfectly clear. Theater investment couldn't be higher risk financially. It also couldn't be more rewarding even if you lose your shirt. </p>
<p>Theater makes the many people creating it and all those attending it smarter, happier, stronger, kinder people. It's experiential, it involves human connection, a thing without which we can't even live. Yeah. I love it. It's in my blood. Can't imagine the world without it, and I'm proud to throw my hat in the ring to try to bring something valuable to it. I think our story has a lot to offer. It lets people know they're ok even if they're imperfect by some made up standards. Our story is for everyday underdogs who shine all the time.</p>
<p>We are unbelievably well positioned for success in the face of staggering odds. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">We have Broadway professionals confirmed to attend, we're the talk of the town already.

Anticipation for the new Millennium hangs in the air as 3 girls, Daisey, Tina and Claire prepare backstage for their first major industry showcase. Just before stepping out onto the stage they learn they're being signed by a record industry icon, but he's going to replace one of them with his blow up doll girlfriend. While singing and dancing their hearts out for the concert they've worked so hard to present, Daisey, Tina and Claire flash back on how they met, what they've overcome, and what they've come to mean to one another. The story is funny, poignant, uplifting, and we're learning very relatable even to men, who seemed as genuinely excited by our readings as their female counterparts. Most importantly, our show gives everyone, regardless of age, shape, pulchritude, the chance to be Prom Queen/King for a night.Here's the production  we need the money for:

Project HistoryI'm Dana McCoy, one of Prom Queens' co-founders. This play has a great history already, with story and music written in 1999ish by three friends; myself, Jennifer Schanke Ragland, and Christina Cass Catton.Those beauties migrated South and sprouted families, meanwhile I wrote another rock musical called ""Cube Rat"" which was workshopped in NYC and at Edinburgh Fringe. Then I got cast in another Rock Musical called ""MoM"" which won the NY fringe. and another original musical, Zoe Lewis's ""Across The Pond!""It wasn't until just last Fall, Margaret Van Sant inspired me to pull this baby, ""Prom Queens"" off mothballs for the Women's International Theater Festival. We only did a reading, but there was momentum, Patty DeLuca came on board to produce, she was not gonna let this thing fade back into the horizon. Besides, people wanted more, they were singing our songs all over town!So we did some more developed readings this April, and at the last moment my Broadway investor friend couldn't travel up from New York. Bad news, right? Dreams dashed, careers crushed, etc. But no. Because to make up for it, he's sending 8 of his Broadway producer friends to see the show in July.Elation! Joy! The world is right. Right? Um...well we're getting there. Now all we have to do is come up with a way to get these people here, put them up for a couple of nights, and figure out a way to pay for it during the busiest part of summer in a resort town. No biggie. We just have to put up a Rock Musical while doing it. These are life's excellent problems. Truly!I have no idea how, but this is happening. Patty and I have rolled up our sleeves, there's no going back. It's Broadway or Bust; Tony's 2015! We hope you'll come with us.And that's the story, morning glory!So much love to anyone who's ever been a part of this or ever will. After all, let's admit it, we all wanna be Prom Queens!!!!xoxoxoxoDana McCoyWho's on the Team?Rick Murray - Venue Owner - Crown & Anchor is supporting Prom Queens with a warm welcome to the Paramount, where Alan Cummings, Liza Minelli, Sandra Bernhard, Donna McKechnie, Andrea McCardle to name just a very few will be performing this summer.  (I'm going to lick the mic.

What We Need 

Budget covers:  Cast and Band (8 people) rehearsal period and 7 shows. Crew: Director, Lighting Designer, Board Op, Sound Designer, Follow Spot Op, Costumes, Prop Master and Props, Set Designer and Set, Printing, Marketing, Producer Fees, Theater Rent, Insurance, Hair, Make-Up, Travel/Lodgings for NY Producers, just for starters.

What You Get

Our love and genuine appreciation, self esteem from being of service to happy hard working artists who are bringing joy to the world, kisses on your cheek, people who'll visit you when you're old. 
Oh and Money! Lots and lots of money if you have the vision to support us at this level before we're massive. It's like getting in on the ground floor of Starbucks.



What happens if we don't make our financial goal, where does the money go?If we don't make our goal, we're doing the show anyway. We may just look a little ragged from exhaustion, costumes from the methodist church swap shop, and our shot at Broadway could take a little longer as we couldn't get the producers here. We'll be hitting you up again in a few months when we need money to take the show to them in NY. Probably more expensive, so. Might as well jump in now is what I'm saying.






The Impact, Risks & Challenges







Broadway is one of the highest risk investments out there. It's also got the greatest potential for return on investment. If a show hits it's possible to make a thousand times or more on one's initial investment. But let's be perfectly clear. Theater investment couldn't be higher risk financially. It also couldn't be more rewarding even if you lose your shirt. 
Theater makes the many people creating it and all those attending it smarter, happier, stronger, kinder people. It's experiential, it involves human connection, a thing without which we can't even live. Yeah. I love it. It's in my blood. Can't imagine the world without it, and I'm proud to throw my hat in the ring to try to bring something valuable to it. I think our story has a lot to offer. It lets people know they're ok even if they're imperfect by some made up standards. Our story is for everyday underdogs who shine all the time.
We are unbelievably well positioned for success in the face of staggering odds. We have Broadway professionals confirmed to attend, we're the talk of the town already. So we're not just coming out of left field. And our story and music have stood the test of time, no matter the honing still needed, audiences for all the developmental phases have always leapt to their feet and left singing our songs. 
Enough about what could go wrong, let 's talk about what could go right:


The Possibilities

Prom Queens hits on Broadway (Tonys), is made into a film which becomes a blockbuster (Oscars) so it's turned into a long running musical TV series (Emmys) where we have a chance to make not one, but many hit records (Grammys). Then starts our concert tour! (Like Spinal Tap! YEAH!)
Each of which leads to Prom Queen Dolls, CDs, Tee Shirts, Videos, Concert Tickets, Hats, Tiaras, $$$$$. Just saying. Bank. Bigtime. Conglomerate. Titans of Industry. She keeps a steady gaze.

We always loved Kenyon’s character June Cool...what were we waiting for?Gaining visibility for THE LAST DAY OF JUNE is the purpose of our crowdfunding campaign. We must go after everything available to attract the right investors and producers for our project. The capital to get THE LAST DAY OF JUNE up and running is estimated at $800K, and then tack on another $100K for promotion and a healthy reserve. To get our musical to Off Broadway... it takes a village!

<p>The
goal of the project by Nanzikambe Arts is to promote a new generation of

leadership that reflect the cultural richness of diverse communities of Malawi. <a href=""http://nanzikambearts.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Please visit our website to find out more about us!</a></p>
<p><b>The Challenge-</b>The arts and culture are essential elements in a sustainable human development process.

vibrant societies by inspiring innovation and imagination, encouraging civic
dialogue and reflecting the rich diversity of our nations’ changing
demographics, unfortunately the world over, even more-so in Africa, many
communities, particularly in times of economic downturn, lack affordable
