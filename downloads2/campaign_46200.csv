<h3> </h3>
<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Cinched Tight Corsets is a design partnership focused on making quality clothing that matters.  We believe that through our corsetry, separates and accessories we can help women feel more confidant, empowered, beautiful and sensual.  We believe that this is an important difference from most design houses who focus on industry sizing and creating pre-fab garments.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As a small design partnership we don't have all the opportunities that a corporate design house does, but we more than make up for that in passion, vision, and an amazing group of supporters.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We are a design partnership, but it's your support that makes it possible, and makes it matter.  Without you we wouldn't have kept at it these last few years, and now you have an opportunity to get involved in our biggest event yet.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our message of inclusive empowerment will be hitting Toronto Alternative Fashion week for the first time this year on April 26th.  Your help is needed to make this possible.  </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The Cinched Tight Message is a unique mix of inclusiveness and empowerment. Our clothing celebrates all women, and encourages women to see their struggles and their challenges as part of what makes them powerful and  beautiful. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>By bringing Cinched Tight to a wider audience you can help spread that message.  You can help prove that what we wear and how we feel about ourselves as women does matter and is something we can control. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>There are two sides to this story; the first side being the Anne-Marie, the designer behind Cinched Tight Corsets. As a self-taught and self funded designer Anne-Marie is a role model for women and for survivors.  Creating beauty through clothing allows Anne-Marie to tell a compelling story of reclaiming her life and making a positive change in the world.  The other side of the story is the women who wear our designs and understand the change it makes for them.  This is clothing that makes you feel confident, sexy, powerful, unique and beautiful.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This is clothing, and a message, that matters.  Help us bring it to a wider audience.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For the Toronto Alternative Fashion week show we will be showcasing 12 outfits, featuring a range of body types and design concepts.    </p>
<p>Normally when a designer or a design house prepares for one of these types of events the funding would come from venture capital, private sector sponsors and financial institutions.  We have looked at these options and we have looked at our message;  they don't line up.   </p>
<p> </p>
<p><br/>Instead we believe that since this is your clothing, we want you to have a change to get involved.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our costs for the show will include the following:<br/>Entrance fee: $600.00 for the 12 designs showcased</p>
<p>Fabrics / R&amp;D / Production: $1,500.00 for all 12 outfits</p>
<p>  - Please be aware that as a corsetry house our expenses per garment include specialty fabrics and findings.</p>
<p>Staging (including accessories, shoes, props etc. and day-of expenses): $900.00</p>
<p>Fundraising efforts : $500.00</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We have put together some very interesting perks to say thank you for your help, each sponsor will receive credits on our main website and an awesome amount of karma, but if you can find it in your heart and budget to give more there are some great goodies in store.  (See the Perks for more specific details)</p>

<span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate"">An accountant… a designer… and an astute entrepreneur! Born over three
decades ago in Nairobi - Kenya, <b>Kenneth
Chiaji</b> grew up in a conservative mid-level Christian family. His fashion
sense became apparent during his juvenile years when he would often modify his
inexpensive threads in a bid to look stylish and keep pace with evolving
fashion trends.<br/><br/><p>After graduating from high school in mid-90, Chiaji took up a financial
accounting job with a real-estate company at the same time enrolled for
part-time accounting course at a local college. Nevertheless, barely two years into
the institution, he abandoned the course and concentrated in designing and
selling hand-crafted handbags to compliment his employment income; although he
had not taken up any fashion design courses.</p>
<p>A fashion student by night in the comfort and confines of his rented apartment
and an employee by day, Kenneth teamed up with his coworkers (<b>Betsy Kendi</b> and <b>Danish Wajero</b>) and incorporated KAYWORTHS INTERNATIONAL LIMITED which began operations in early 2011
as a private-equity fashion company. Kenneth’s debut into the fashion industry
was largely inspired by an inborn passion and love for fashion coupled with
inventive design skills nurtured progressively over the years. </p>
<p>It is such meticulous passion about
fashion that saw the birthing of KAYWORTHS trade slogan: ""<b>Passion Inspired Fashion</b>” With prime
focus on originality and quality, KAYWORTHS team has developed an exclusive <i>Handbag Brand</i> known as DIVABAG.</p>

<h3><strong>Our MISSION</strong></h3></strong></h3></strong></strong></h3>
<p>For countless
decades, the fashion industry has put emphasis on clothing as the principal
item on the fashion runway. However, at KAYWORTHS fashion goes beyond clothing
and that is where the DIVABAG™ Handbag brand comes in! </p>
<p><b>DIVABAG
seeks to </b><i>Re-define
Handbag Fashion</i><b> by
placing this forgotten yet very useful item back into its rightful place on the
red carpet.</b><b>We aim to create highly
distinctive, branded handbags with impeccable quality, but with price points
which are affordable to the average person... the kind of product that is only
currently available at the very high-end of the market to very few consumers</b>! </p>
We aspire
to attain a significant niche in the world of contemporary fashion by using
exceptional marketing skills, merchandising strategy and brand positioning. We
believe that giving you a quality product or something you truly value
increases the likelihood that you will look beyond the price tag, pay the full
price and enjoy the benefits long after the cost is forgotten. <br/><br/><br/><h3><strong><h3><strong><strong><h3><strong><h3><strong><strong><h3><strong><h3><b><u><h3><strong><h3></h3>

<br/><br/><h3><strong><h3><strong><strong><h3><strong><h3><strong>Divabag IN THE MARKET PLACE</strong></h3></strong></h3></strong></strong></h3></strong></h3>
<p>In order for us to
find out if others were as excited about DIVABAG as we were, we had to test the
market! We participated in numerous runway shows and trade expos with impressive
outcome. A number of boutique owners were very keen to stock our products in
addition to individual orders. We literary sold-out every time we participated in
a trade fair or a fashion event - often struggling to satisfy the demand. The
total sales revenue within the first six months of operation cloaked an
inspiring $ 7,500.</p>

<br/><strong></strong></strong></strong></h3>
<h3><strong>The SETBACK</strong></h3></strong></h3></strong></h3></strong></strong></h3></strong></h3>Unfortunately before the company could break-even, it
was in late 2011 when Kenneth fell-out with his employer and lost his job - which was at the
time the principal source of funding for the project. Although DIVABAG has
generated considerable excitement within the fashion circles, we had no option
but to gradually cut-back on brand marketing in order to keep
the company afloat and satisfy
our growing host of DIVABAG enthusiasts. <br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/43429/files/20130830134233-Pg.095-GL.Galary.1.jpg?1377895353"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

</h3></strong></strong></h3></strong></h3></strong></h3></strong></strong></h3></strong></h3></span></span></span><p>With barely sufficient inventory amidst cash-flow constraints, we have often turned-down purchase orders. At one time we approached a commercial bank hoping we could get a 'start-up' loan to finance the company's capital costs, but did not succeed due to the stringent and prohibitive requirements for funding newly established businesses in Kenya. Many are the times we have felt like giving up... times when everything seems to be running against our strategies and plans... yet in all, we keep holding firmly without wavering to the hope of realization of our dream!<br/></p>

<h3><strong>Our COMEBACK STRATEGY</strong></h3></strong></h3></strong></strong></h3></strong></h3></strong></h3></strong></strong></h3></strong></h3>We spent
the better part of the last 12 months or so basically doing further market research
and developing the brand around the product. Secondly, we have developed a fantastic Magazine dubbed ‘DIVABAG™ which showcases our handbag brands

planning team has invested in developing this exclusive handbag brand, we strongly
believe now is the time to dress up the vision to absolute realization. We strongly believe that DIVABAG is a master-piece that
will inject a whole new life into handbag fashion and change the general
perception that runway fashion show is all about clothing! However, to begin we require a sizeable
inventory… and that is where your support comes in handy! </p>
<p>Recently we considered Equity Financing as an alternative funding
option for the proposed Launch. The three shareholders of KAYWORTHS suggested a buyout-deal that would see the exit of
two shareholders, and bring on-board one willing buyer to take up their combined
equity in consideration for the required funds. <b><span>“A promising idea it sounded at the first
mention, but sadly no business ever wants to sacrifice its Human Resource for
whatever reason..! ” </span></b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Fortunately, before we implemented this drastic measure, we gladly
came across the INDIEGOGO crowd-funding platform and resolved that it was the best
and sure way of funding this noble initiative.</p>

Born over three
decades ago in Nairobi - Kenya, Kenneth
Chiaji grew up in a conservative mid-level Christian family. His fashion
sense became apparent during his juvenile years when he would often modify his
inexpensive threads in a bid to look stylish and keep pace with evolving
fashion trends.After graduating from high school in mid-90, Chiaji took up a financial
accounting job with a real-estate company at the same time enrolled for
part-time accounting course at a local college. Nevertheless, barely two years into
the institution, he abandoned the course and concentrated in designing and
selling hand-crafted handbags to compliment his employment income; although he
had not taken up any fashion design courses.
A fashion student by night in the comfort and confines of his rented apartment
and an employee by day, Kenneth teamed up with his coworkers (Betsy Kendi and Danish Wajero) and incorporated KAYWORTHS INTERNATIONAL LIMITED which began operations in early 2011
as a private-equity fashion company. Kenneth’s debut into the fashion industry
was largely inspired by an inborn passion and love for fashion coupled with
inventive design skills nurtured progressively over the years. 
It is such meticulous passion about
fashion that saw the birthing of KAYWORTHS trade slogan: ""Passion Inspired Fashion” With prime
focus on originality and quality, KAYWORTHS team has developed an exclusive Handbag Brand known as DIVABAG.

Above: KAYWORTHS TEAM: From L to R: Rossie, Phina, Kenneth Chiaji (Founder & Director), Betsy Kendi (Shareholder), Samuel and Danish Wajero (Director) 




Our PRODUCTSDIVABAG handbags are classified in two main categories namely:
#1 - DIVABAG Designer Handbag
Made using
100% genuine Italian leather, this
category comprises Privately Labeled Designer Handbags; outsourced
and assembled in China by a reputable manufacturer. DIVABAG guarantees
that all its Genuine Leather Handbags are made by first-class Italian leather
and warrants the original purchaser that the product will be free from defects
in materials and workmanship. 



#2 - Designer-Inspired Collection
This synthetic collection consists
mainly of Totes and Cross-body bags which
are manufactured using Premium quality PU Leather and sourced from a reputable fashion house in California, USA. We hope that at the end of this campaign, you will enjoy this
exciting shopping experience as much as we have enjoyed presenting it to you
today.
Our Cross-body bag Collection looks stylish and yet leaves
your hands free to engage in important activities (eating ice-cream, sipping
flat-white coffee, etc). Whether you are walking in the countryside or
attending a red carpet event, this latest craze is an incredibly easy one to
get in. It's perfect for the young at heart; in particular teenagers and the
busy woman. Chances are you won't have to spend so much at KAYWORTHS to be a
proud owner of one. 



We believe that giving you a quality product or something you truly
value increases the likelihood that you will look beyond the price tag, pay the
full price and enjoy the benefits long after the cost is forgotten.


Our MISSION
For countless
decades, the fashion industry has put emphasis on clothing as the principal
item on the fashion runway. However, at KAYWORTHS fashion goes beyond clothing
and that is where the DIVABAG™ Handbag brand comes in! 
DIVABAG
seeks to Re-define
Handbag Fashion by
placing this forgotten yet very useful item back into its rightful place on the
red carpet.We aim to create highly
distinctive, branded handbags with impeccable quality, but with price points
which are affordable to the average person... the kind of product that is only
currently available at the very high-end of the market to very few consumers! 
We aspire
to attain a significant niche in the world of contemporary fashion by using
exceptional marketing skills, merchandising strategy and brand positioning. We
believe that giving you a quality product or something you truly value
increases the likelihood that you will look beyond the price tag, pay the full
price and enjoy the benefits long after the cost is forgotten. 

Divabag IN THE MARKET PLACE
In order for us to
find out if others were as excited about DIVABAG as we were, we had to test the
market! We participated in numerous runway shows and trade expos with impressive
outcome. A number of boutique owners were very keen to stock our products in
addition to individual orders. We literary sold-out every time we participated in
a trade fair or a fashion event - often struggling to satisfy the demand. The
total sales revenue within the first six months of operation cloaked an
inspiring $ 7,500.



The SETBACKUnfortunately before the company could break-even, it
was in late 2011 when Kenneth fell-out with his employer and lost his job - which was at the
time the principal source of funding for the project. Although DIVABAG has
generated considerable excitement within the fashion circles, we had no option
but to gradually cut-back on brand marketing in order to keep
the company afloat and satisfy
our growing host of DIVABAG enthusiasts. 


With barely sufficient inventory amidst cash-flow constraints, we have often turned-down purchase orders. At one time we approached a commercial bank hoping we could get a 'start-up' loan to finance the company's capital costs, but did not succeed due to the stringent and prohibitive requirements for funding newly established businesses in Kenya. Many are the times we have felt like giving up... times when everything seems to be running against our strategies and plans... yet in all, we keep holding firmly without wavering to the hope of realization of our dream!




Our COMEBACK STRATEGYWe spent
the better part of the last 12 months or so basically doing further market research
and developing the brand around the product. Secondly, we have developed a fantastic Magazine dubbed ‘DIVABAG™ which showcases our handbag brands
and is envisioned to become a powerful marketing tool for our handbag-line.BELOW:  Kenneth scrutinizing a DIVABAG MagazineBELOW:  An up-coming DIVABAG Magazine Cover
Next, we are planning a DIVABAG™ Premiere Launch slated for or before the 14th
December 2013. It is going to be a time of Celebration…
a time of Dedication and Launch of this unique business initiative! We intend
to release DIVABAG Handbag-Fashion Line into the market place
as we share cocktail bites, drinks and gifts with invited guests, friends and
loved ones.





We will showcase an assortment of DIVABAG handbags via runway shows complemented by mini-boutique exhibition sale. The projected revenue for the first 6 months after the launch is US$ 48,600 or an average of 50 handbags per month. We also envision the launch as a precursor to establish the first DIVABAG retail outlet in Nairobi in the very near future.

BELOW: the KAYWORTHS planning Team consulting on an issue over a round-table!

With thousands of man-hours our
planning team has invested in developing this exclusive handbag brand, we strongly
believe now is the time to dress up the vision to absolute realization. We strongly believe that DIVABAG is a master-piece that
will inject a whole new life into handbag fashion and change the general
perception that runway fashion show is all about clothing! However, to begin we require a sizeable
inventory… and that is where your support comes in handy! 
Recently we considered Equity Financing as an alternative funding
option for the proposed Launch. The three shareholders of KAYWORTHS suggested a buyout-deal that would see the exit of
two shareholders, and bring on-board one willing buyer to take up their combined
equity in consideration for the required funds. “A promising idea it sounded at the first
mention, but sadly no business ever wants to sacrifice its Human Resource for
whatever reason..! ” 


Fortunately, before we implemented this drastic measure, we gladly
came across the INDIEGOGO crowd-funding platform and resolved that it was the best
and sure way of funding this noble initiative.



How Much Money Do We Require?


Our Initial goal is to raise US$ 17,850 out of which approximately   $ 10,500 goes towards the Premiere Launch event and $7,350 for the first Production Run of DIVABAG Designer Handbags:
We have come up with a modest Budget as entailed below: Once we receive the funds, we shall set everything rolling in preparation for the launch event.


Each Divabag Designer handbag will retail for
$270 on average, so in appreciation of your contribution, Pre-Ordering
them here for $199 is indeed a great deal.

<p><strong>Can these socks actually be comfortable if they are made out of plastic?</strong></p>
<p>They are horribly uncomfortable! Just kidding!! They are amazingly comfortable! In all seriousness, every person who has been fortunate enough to get their hands on a swaggr prototype says “I did not expect them to feel this way!” We may be a little biased, but we have never worn such comfortable athletic socks. Ever. Period. However, the only way for you to know for sure is to support us along this journey and get some pairs for yourself!</p>
<p><strong>Do your feet get stinky after wearing swaggr socks?</strong></p>
<p>Nobody likes stinky feet! Luckily, everybody that has worn these socks has said their feet did not stink. Yay!!</p>
<p><strong>Why are there no sizes to choose from?</strong></p>
<p>There is only one size! Swaggr socks are engineered using a specific yarn that allows us the perfect fit from a kids size 1 up to a men's size 16! I know it sounds crazy and companies say this all of the time. Seriously, though! We have designed the socks specifically to be able to do this! Don't take my word for it. Try it for yourself!</p>

<br/><ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>Your donation will help fund not only my passion, but my dream career. I will use this to buy a new sewing machine, and tons of fabric to be able to design clothing. This clothing is not only for personal use however. I have met a lot of people in the fashion industry at Lasalle College, and once my portfolio is diverse enough, I will show my creations to various Canadian and American Companies.</div>
<div>If you are unable to donate, please share this with your friends and coworkers, in order to spread my campaign!</div>
<div>Although I am hoping to go big, or even just become a local designer, you can know your donation went towards helping a young girl achieve her dreams. </div>
<div>Thank you !!!! :)</div>

</div></div>","Who Am I? My name is Marla, and I am 20 years old. I live with 2 roommates in Montreal, and I work at a bakery to support myself. I am currently attending Lasalle College in Fashion Design. 
My Passions : Fashion and Modeling! 
I was always into fashion, and my dream has always been to start my own line of clothing. Why not start now? I have a ton of ambition, and dedication to my dream, but lack the means to start pursuing it.

Why Help Me?
I love to make clothing, and I aspire to go far doing so. I am however struggling to support myself through college. I work part time at a bakery, but I don't make enough to spend on luxuries such as fabric. This pays for, and barely even so, the bare minimum.
I am asking for help simply as a small kick to my career. This money will be used for buying a new sewing machine and fabrics in order to keep pursuing my passion. I am not asking for much, and it may seem like a small amount, but It could really help me a lot! :)   What I Do I like to design dresses mostly, and I learn a lot about it in College. I have also designed handbags, hats, and shirts. I use some resources at the College to sew dresses on my spare time, such as this one I completed a few months ago.

This black dress took me a little over 15 hours to make, and I am very proud with the result! My style varies a lot, from fancy ornamental clothing, to simple elegant dresses. Here is another Dress I have designed. This one has a bit more of a creative pattern on it, and supports long sleeves and a V-neck.
I have also been experimenting with designing Bra's, and have recently finished making my first prototype for them. Here is the first one I have made.

 We never could have gotten here without the help of a vocal community of friends, product testers, and wise souls who have guided and supported us along the way. We want to show our appreciation to those of you who speak up and share our campaign, even if you're not ready to pledge. Click one of the buttons below, screenshot your post and message it to us at www.facebook.com/gethoneylove. We'll send you a free download link to Betsie's 1-hour DJ mix as a thank you.  
  
  
 
 
  
 Become a backer of this project and pick a reward. This allows you to PRE-ORDER Sculptwear before it gets made. You will not only be one of the first people to receive Sculptwear, but you will get a special backer discount as a thank you for the early support. Want to buy more than one pair of Sculptwear, or a mix of 'Runway Black', 'Sand' and 'Vamp' Sculptwear? You've got options! Check out the different reward packages (on the right side at the top of this page), spread the word and get friends to order with you so you can take advantage of increased discounts with the bundled rewards.    
 
  We will use the funds to produce the first full factory order of Sculptwear across our complete size range, which also includes plus sizes. We obsessed over the selection of every fabric and trim in order to achieve the amazing comfort and shaping that we are promising. Our factory uses state of the art production methods, provides a clean and safe working environment and fair wages to workers. We'd like to say a heartfelt thanks for your support in helping us to bring innovation to undergarments, and are so glad you're joining our journey!

-We do this by wearing protective creams & clothing to block the sun's damaging rays in ALL other circumstances.
-Remember, the light source, unlike the sun billions of miles away, is 1 cm above the top of our skin.
-Getting a gel manicure is the same as sitting in the sun (without sunblock) for 20 to 40 minutes!  If you don't start protecting your skin today you can count on premature aging tomorrow.  Don't risk it!
-A lot of us have been getting gel manicures regularly for the past several years.  In as little as 8 to 10 visits (5 months!) the lamps ""may produce enough UV exposure to cause skin damage,"" according to the Skin Cancer Foundation.
-Even if you do gel manicures infrequently, UV damage is cumulative, this means the damage you received 2 months, 6 months, a year ago is still present & additional UV exposure will bring you closer to causing irreparable skin damage.

Endorsed by Dr. Chris Adigun
 
                                                Dr. Adigun, after extensively examining the data contained in published studies, determined the amount of UV radiation we are exposed was enough to merit protecting our skin.  She proudly endorses YouVeeShield.                                                                                       -UV light is damaging to our skin.  -UV light during a gel manicure is generated from a light source that is 1 cm from the top of our skin.  -Each gel manicure equals 20 to 40 minutes of direct sunlight and that is if your manicurist is even following the directions, which most are not.  -This means you are receiving even more exposure than what was ""deemed"" safe. -In as little as 8-10 visits, some lamps ""may produce enough UV exposure to cause skin damage,"" according to the Skin Cancer Foundation.

UV/LED lamps used to cure the gel emit UV radiation, and this can cause damage to our skin.

UV and LED lamps are classified as moderate risk by Dr. Sayre & Dr. Dowdy, industry titans which is not as safe as you might think.

This sounds benign; however, moderate risk or “risk two” lamps are the highest risk group of lighting systems allowed to be used by the general public in unsupervised conditions. So it’s actually quite high. See the ""Photobiological Safety Evaluation of UV Nail Lamps study"" 
These “safe exposure” limits also do not take into account anyone with a photosensitivity, such as blond hair, blue eyes, certain make-up and perfumes or even handling of a citrus fruit. All of these things can make people sensitive to light without their knowledge - and any exposure to UV during this time can now “turbo charge” any damage that is occurring.


Nail Salons are not educating their customers on the danger or properly training their nail professionals
Nail Salons nationwide are not properly training their nail professionals to use these lamps according to the manufacturer’s conditions
The Nail Salons are not providing any adequate protection from the UV radiation.
Nail professionals are routinely not following the manufacturer’s instructions for the proper curing times of each coat of gel polish.  They are “guessing” to cure longer than what has been determined as “safe” (if you happen to be light sensitive, this does not even include you) often curing 3 times the required amount.
Many nail professionals do not use the nail lamp manufactured by the same gel polish company. This can cause severe chemical burns.

Two years ago we started Enclave Eyewear with the simple goal of offering polarized sunglasses made from unique materials.

</p><div>DUFFLER is not just about great bags, it is equally much about lifting your eyes to find new goals in life. There will be a solid base of challenges that we hope will inspire you to find new corners of the world.<p>For each challenge 
we set out, there is a little badge you get when you have made it. The 
badge is made for being attached to your bag as a token of your 
achievement. You are using the app for browsing among all the challenges. Add the ones you like to your list of favorites. The app will keep track of your achievements and we will happily put a little badge in the mail for you when you have made it. And yes, you will also get a digital badge in your journal.<br/></p>
<p>For
 some badges it will require you to really stretch your limits while 
others could be accomplished just because you are in the mood. <br/></p>

We have spent almost two years developing and perfecting the DUFFLER concept and the first set of bags are on their way. Now we are reaching out to you because we hope that you will take an active role in forming what we believe will be and vibrant and inspiring community, the DUFFLER World. As a special token of your support we will fit your bag with the special ""Crowdfunder"" badge.

All your achievements and victories celebrated will make up wonderful stories to be remembered. A DUFFLER bag is made for carrying all the things you need together with the stories you are proud of.

We, and many others, believe DUFFLER One is a fantastic bag. DUFFLER One is cabin sized and made only from durable high quality materials and components. Timeless 
without feeling simple and with little details that makes it something 
special. You can easily fit the necessary things for a few days trip – 
clothing, extra shoes, tablet, a good book, and whatever else you need to
 make the perfect trip. Each bag is an individual, identified by a unique identity number.
Outer lining: Coated polythene fabricComponents: YKK brass Zippers and high quality bucklesSize: 570mm * 250mm * 300mm / 22.5” * 10.5"" * 11.8""Volume: Approx 45L / 2,746 cu.inWeight: 1 kg / 2.2lbsColors: Coyote (Medium Beige) and Tarmac (Green/Gray)Warranty: 10 Years
One pocket on the outside and three pockets on the inside. And one concealed pocket on the inside where you could put the beacon, passport or money. 
It comes with a detachable shoulder strap and has 24 slots for fitting our DUFFLER badges.""We go to some pretty extreme places and are always churning through gear on our adventures. Finally, the Duffler One has been able to keep up! Rugged on the outside, beautifully refined on the inside. It's a bag that suits anyone from the most intrepid expeditioners to the image focused modern man."" -Ryan J, thisworldexistsAs an owner of a DUFFLER bag you get access to the DUFFLER Digital world via a mobile app in 
your smartphone. The central part of this world is your private travel 
journal where you store notes, images and memories from the adventures you have made. Connect the journal to your existing social media; like Facebook and 
Instagram so that you instantly could share your achievements with 
friends and family.
Secondly you could search among all the challenges we have set out to
 inspire you. Browse by location, category or type of activity and add 
it to your list with Favorites.
In the app you also keep track of your different DUFFLER bags and 
beacons. And you could also see which achievements and badges you have 
on which bag.


The DUFFLER Beacon is a small gadget that is provided by our great friends at Estimote, Inc. The beacon has no buttons, weights approx 30 grams and has an expected battery lifetime of 3 years. You simply put it in the bag to establish a digital connection, via the app in your smartphone, to your journal in the DUFFLER Digital World. With help of the beacon you get automatic updates in the journal with data like your position, surrounding temperature and your movements.


Another unique feature of the beacon is that you now could alarm your bag. If the bag starts to move away from you, your smartphone will start to sound and vibrate to make you aware of what is about to happen.


DUFFLER is not just about great bags, it is equally much about lifting your eyes to find new goals in life. There will be a solid base of challenges that we hope will inspire you to find new corners of the world.For each challenge 
we set out, there is a little badge you get when you have made it. The 
badge is made for being attached to your bag as a token of your 
achievement. You are using the app for browsing among all the challenges. Add the ones you like to your list of favorites. The app will keep track of your achievements and we will happily put a little badge in the mail for you when you have made it. And yes, you will also get a digital badge in your journal.
For
 some badges it will require you to really stretch your limits while 
others could be accomplished just because you are in the mood. 






We have spent almost two years developing and perfecting the DUFFLER concept and the first set of bags are on their way. Now we are reaching out to you because we hope that you will take an active role in forming what we believe will be and vibrant and inspiring community, the DUFFLER World. As a special token of your support we will fit your bag with the special ""Crowdfunder"" badge. The funds we receive from this campaign will be used for shipping the first bags, finalizing the mobile app and to order a second set of bags. We also have some new models in the pipeline that we hope to be able to realize too.
We would love if you could consider helping us by promoting the DUFFLER 
community and our campaign among your friends. And to show you our 
appreciation we will reward you a 10€ refund on your contribution for 
every successful referral you make. To help us keep track of your

Dak Anthony underwear will be a sexy, comfortable, fun line, while still focusing on great support letting you rock it out on stage without worrying about too much movement.Personally, this has been a dream of mine for a long time and is a project I have been passionate about to help me regain myself spiritually while having fun and helping to build some security for my family.What We NeedAll funds raised will help create Dak Anthony the brand. Not only having the underwear made but also the business portion: finding models to be the face of the company,  hiring a photographer, creating and maintaining a website, advertisements, and booking underwear shows/ parties are all part of getting this business (and myself) up on it's feet.  The Impact Dak Anthony underwear will be fashionable, made with great quality, and sold at very afforadable prices.I love to hear feed back from everyone...positive and negative. .I feel this will only make my product better for the company as well as the consumer.I want to make men of all types comfortable in my underwear, but most of all comfortable in their own skin. The Dak Anthony brand will have an assortment of underwear that will help do just that.Other Ways You Can HelpI know some people just can’t contribute, but that doesn’t mean they can’t help:Ask folks to get the word out and make some noise about Dak Anthony underwear line.

<h3>ALZHEIMER'S/DEMENTIA AND WANDERING. </h3>
<h3>A GLOBAL CRISIS REQUIRING A GLOBAL SOLUTION. </h3>
<p>Hello my name is Ardelia Mays I am a registered nurse in the state of Georgia,  I currently work as a  case manager in the home healthcare field. 60% of my patients have some form of dementia. When a loved one has Alzheimer’s or dementia, it affects everyone in the family. One of concerns of a family member or caregiver is what to do to keep them safe and keep them from wandering off.</p>
<p>Please take a moment to watch this short video.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>I CAN'T IN GOOD CONSCIOUSNESS SIT BACK AND IGNORE THIS PROBLEM as families look at us as Caregivers for answers or problem solvers. Family members and caregivers are overwhelmed, not getting enough sleep and feeling like they are going out of their minds all because all of the continuous  worring of their loved ones safety. The fear of them wandering off and getting lost, hurt or worse ending up in an unsafe area and getting killed.Alzheimer’s disease causes people to lose their ability to recognize familiar places and faces. It’s common for a person living with dementia to wander or become lost or confused about their location, and it can happen at any stage of the disease. Six in 10 people living with dementia will wander at least once; many do so repeatedly. Although common, wandering can be dangerous — even life-threatening — and the stress of this risk weighs heavily on caregivers and family. </p>
<p>Family members and caregivers often reach out to me inquiring about how to help keep their loved ones safe with this debilitating disease. One question I often get asked is how can they keep their loved one from wandering off during the night or when they're home alone during the day for fear of them getting lost or hurt or worse ending up in an unsafe environment and getting killed.</p>
<p>I am a very compassionate person,  I love being a caregiver. It breaks my heart to see the pain and stress that the families endure on a daily basis when caring for loved ones with cognitive Impairments.  My heart aches for the ones who suffers with this awful disease.  I don't have a cure for this disease but my husband and I have created a way to help keep the patients safe and give the family and caregivers a sense of security and peace of mind. We want to introduce to you our KOLOS GPS TRACKING BRACELET. We created this bracelet for the purpose of keeping people safe who tend to wander off for instance people with Alzheimer's and Dementia.</p>

""Triple Threat Hat's"" are a three in one hat which let's you choose how you're going to wear your headwear.Hello, my name is Anthony and I enjoy wearing hat's just like the next person. One day as I was getting ready to enjoy a day of outdoor activities,  I was unsure if the clouds where going to keep the sun hidden. Not knowing left me undecided on what to wear. Should I wear a visor or a hat, turns out I decided to wear a visor, and as I was enjoying my day those clouds went away resulting in the top of my head getting burned.

<p><span>This award winning time piece was designed by Gusztav Szikszai two years ago and when the initial pictures were posted online there was a lot of interest with many people in various forums asking how they could get hold of one.</span></p>

<ul>
<li>simple and clean design</li>
<li>unique clock aspect around the ring’s band</li>
<li>eco-friendly and playful - the time is displayed when you rotate the ring</li>
<li>cutting edge technology (wireless charge, ultrathin battery, energy-saving LEDs)</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h3>Ring Clock as part of everyday life</h3>
<p>There won't be party where you do not get asked by somebody to show 
off this beautiful gadget. Whenever you need to know the time just spin 
the ring and you will see the time....and others will see it too!</p>
<p>Ring Clock can improve your sense of time too. How about trying to 
predict the time before you rotate the ring? It sounds silly but we bet 
that you will play along with us at some point!</p>
<p>
It is also very green with no wasted energy because in real time, when 
you want, it shows the time. Our next dream is that rotation kinetic 
energy will give the power to the LED lights meaning that the next 
version of Ring Clock can be entirely green. If we achieve significant 
support we will start to work on this dream earlier. </p>

<h3>Design inspiration from Gusztav</h3>
<p>“It started with a challenge 2 years ago at <a href=""http://cgsociety.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://cgsociety.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">CGSociety.org</a>
 named Moving Innovation. The idea was to create visualisation for a 
product that cannot exist today, but could exist 10 years from now. I 
wanted to create something that is innovative, good to look at and can 
actually be useful. I never wore a watch on my wrist because I don't 
like the feeling, but I like watches in general, so I used that 
opportunity to let my mind come up with something that I could wear, the
 <a href=""http://challenge.cgsociety.org/nvart06/entry/cyber"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://challenge.cgsociety.org/nvart06/entry/cyber"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ring Clock.</a>” </p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">We had to change some things on the original design for the 
feasibility, because technology has not been able to catch up with 
Guszti’s dreams in the past 2 years!</span><br/></p>

<h3>Project timeline and budget</h3>
<p><b>Our status as at Aug 2013: </b></p>
<p>In
 the last 4 months we have finished the conceptual model and made some 
small design changes for feasibility. We have contacted with the 
potential suppliers: ring turner, micro laser cutter, flexible circuit 
board manufacturer, battery manufacturer, resin and antibacterial 
nanotechnology specialist. </p>
<p>We have prepared schematic diagrams 
and layouts for the prototype board (in 1:1 scale). Printed Circuit 
Board manufacturing and component purchasing are ongoing. We have  
produced 36 ring bodies from 316L stainless steel for prototypes, the 
micro laser cutting with 30 micron cutting edge is ongoing (see the pictures below).</p>

<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
<p></p>
<p><b>1, Battery Life</b> / What happens to the ring once the battery has reached the end of its lifetime (expected to be 3 years)?</p>
<p><b>UPDATE: </b></p>
<p>Many of you were asking questions about whether we could replace the battery and we have worked hard in the last few days to provide you with a solution. Our battery is a non-standard size battery due to the fact that there is no standard size to fit within a ring and we need to keep the water resistance. This means that you cannot replace it at home so we are proud to be able to offer you a <b>battery replacement service</b>.</p>
<p>After the battery has died, you can send us your Ring Clock and we will replace the battery (because we will use removable resin around the battery). The planned fee of the battery replacement service is around $25. For the full costs, you have to allow the cost of shipping this item to us (around $15) and we will charge you to send the ring back to you ($15) so realistically the expected cost of battery replacement with shipping cost is around $55.</p>
<p><strike style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">We will integrate a non-standard size ultrathin rechargeable lithium polymer battery into the Ring Clock. The electronics will be within resin for water resistance. Ring Clock is an electronic gadget with a lot of electronic parts, so the life expectancy is based on our expectations similar to other electronic devices such as a mobile phone. The procurement of components will be an important aspect of life expectancy, but we can not promise more than the parts manufacturers. We hope in the next 3 years there will be a Ring Clock 2.0 with rotational kinetic power supply and therefore a longer life expectancy. We understand your request and we will investigate the replaceable battery, but we cannot make any promises at this stage.</strike><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>2, Water Resistant</b> / Can I wash my hands wearing it or do I have to remove it prior to washing my hands?</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>We are currently researching what would be the best solution and have been in communication with a resin and nanotechnology specialist to find out about the current technology. As you will appreciate however we have to test this before we make big promises although we are hoping that it will be WR 100M (Suitable for recreational surfing, swimming, snorkelling, sailing and water sports - <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_Resistant_mark"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">wiki</a>) although of course we cannot promise this high level WR at this moment in time.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>3, Warranty</b> / What is the warranty period and how will it be handled for international customers?</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The warranty offered for Ring Clock is 1 year. It is expected that the customer will send back the ring clock to us at their own expense, we will review it and if it is not abnormal usage then it will be replaced and it will be delivered free of charge. The warranty is not applicable to cases other than defects in material, design and workmanship.</p>
<p><b>4, Ring size and colour</b> / When will you need my ringsize and colour?<br/></p>
<p>Once the campaign has been successful we will contact you in November 2013 to ask you for your ring size and LED colour choice. We will also send you emails about important events, and we also plan to upgrade our site where you will have a private account (we will send you details on e-mail) and you can add your ring size, colour and change your address if it needs to be changed.<br/></p>
<p><b>5, Shipping cost </b>/ <span>I just funded this, and I forgot to add 15$ shipping, what should I do?</span><br/></p>
<p><span>Contribute a further $15 with the same e-mail address so we know it is your shipping cost.<br/></span></p>
<p><b>6, Ring Clock function</b> / Are <span>Hours, Minutes and Seconds able to rotate independently of each other or They are on the same ring?</span><br/></p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p>The hours, minutes and seconds are on the same outer ring. The inner ring is the one that is in contact with your finger. The outer ring rotation activates the <br/>LED's and you can see the time around the ring. Sometimes you see the hours and minutes close to each other (e.g. 13:30) and sometimes you will have to rotate more, because the hour and minute are far away from each other (e.g. 13:55).</p>
<p>The original concept and design from 2011 was that the hours, minutes and seconds would be on separate rings, they rotate individually and automatically however this has proved impossible to manufacture at this moment in time.</p></span><p></p>

Ring Clock background
This award winning time piece was designed by Gusztav Szikszai two years ago and when the initial pictures were posted online there was a lot of interest with many people in various forums asking how they could get hold of one.


Design from 2011


Since then we have been fine tuning the design and technology so that we could deliver the best quality product and building the right team to bring this to market. We are pleased to say that within the timescales below we believe that we can now answer the calls and produce this with your support.
The goal of our Ring Clock project:




simple and clean design
unique clock aspect around the ring’s band
eco-friendly and playful - the time is displayed when you rotate the ring
cutting edge technology (wireless charge, ultrathin battery, energy-saving LEDs)


Ring Clock as part of everyday life
There won't be party where you do not get asked by somebody to show 
off this beautiful gadget. Whenever you need to know the time just spin 
the ring and you will see the time....and others will see it too!
Ring Clock can improve your sense of time too. How about trying to 
predict the time before you rotate the ring? It sounds silly but we bet 
that you will play along with us at some point!

It is also very green with no wasted energy because in real time, when 
you want, it shows the time. Our next dream is that rotation kinetic 
energy will give the power to the LED lights meaning that the next 
version of Ring Clock can be entirely green. If we achieve significant 
support we will start to work on this dream earlier. 

Design inspiration from Gusztav
“It started with a challenge 2 years ago at CGSociety.org
 named Moving Innovation. The idea was to create visualisation for a 
product that cannot exist today, but could exist 10 years from now. I 
wanted to create something that is innovative, good to look at and can 
actually be useful. I never wore a watch on my wrist because I don't 
like the feeling, but I like watches in general, so I used that 
opportunity to let my mind come up with something that I could wear, the
 Ring Clock.” 
We had to change some things on the original design for the 
feasibility, because technology has not been able to catch up with 
Guszti’s dreams in the past 2 years!

Project timeline and budget
Our status as at Aug 2013: 
In
 the last 4 months we have finished the conceptual model and made some 
small design changes for feasibility. We have contacted with the 
potential suppliers: ring turner, micro laser cutter, flexible circuit 
board manufacturer, battery manufacturer, resin and antibacterial 
nanotechnology specialist. 
We have prepared schematic diagrams 
and layouts for the prototype board (in 1:1 scale). Printed Circuit 
Board manufacturing and component purchasing are ongoing. We have  
produced 36 ring bodies from 316L stainless steel for prototypes, the 
micro laser cutting with 30 micron cutting edge is ongoing (see the pictures below).














Project plan:



Aug-Oct 2013: prototype building (electrical and mechanical)


Nov-Dec 2013: prototype testing and finishing


Jan-March 2014: first batch goes into production


Apr 2014: first batch ready for delivery


Apr-Jun 2014: second batch goes into production

We are uniting all gentlemen out there that live up to a certain codex recently suppressed in our modern society:
We are good for our word.
We are courteous and understanding.
We are classy, and live up to our standards.
We treat everyone and everything with respect.
We work hard to make our and the lives of others better - every single day. 
PURE Premium Detergent for Men is just the beginning. Our laundry detergent stands for a autonomous, modern, and responsible gentleman that wants to use a simple, but premium product.Come and join our community. Let's make the great codex of real gentlemen flourish again. Let's make the world a better place. Let's care again!Gentlemen, spread the word:LET'S REDEFINE GENTLEMEN!Gentlemen, jump on board and help us with the first step:-> Back this campaign to bring PURE Detergent to every gentleman's hand. <- Gentlemen, here is what you get: Let's make it simple: With your financial support, we are bringing PURE Premium Detergent for Men to production.With our funding goal of 3.000 EUR we will produce exactly 300 units and send them to our initial customers. PURE Detergent has been in development for over one year. Here is a short wrap up of what we took care of:
We worked together with a local, but very experienced soap manufacturer MADE IN GERMANY which was founded nearly 110 years ago.  We decided to use a very eco-friendly but effective detergent that gets rid of any grime and that suits any fabric: PURE Detergent is simple and it works perfectly on cotton, silk and synthetic fabrics of any color! PLUS: All ingredients are carefully selected, completely bio-degradable and economical. The concentrate provides  up to 25 loads on a single 1.0L canister.
We tested almost 100 different scents to get it just right. Now we are sure that PURE Detergent smells right before and after doing laundry. The scent is neither too faint nor too pungent. It smells fresh, but clearly masculine and defines a real gentleman. It fits well with all the other perfumes that you might use and works on every fabric: Whether shirts, towels, bed sheets, or underwear: PURE Detergents defines what being a man is all about and totally separates itself from all the laundry detergents on the market.
We have redefined laundry detergent packaging: PURE Detergent comes in a completely recycable but classic and generous tinplate canister wrapped in a beautiful black label with a lot of attention to detail. Have a look for yourself!
We have reinvented a laundry detergent being simple and easy to use. With PURE we are simplifying the lives of any gentlemen doing their laundry, 100% worry-free:Our supply chain is already secure: We have already validated all suppliers and tested many prototypes. PURE Detergent is now ready to go and is waiting for only one last thing:FOR CLASSY GENTLEMEN THAT WANT TO GET THIS MISSION GOING!We have divided this campaign into three different and simple perks: The more you buy, the greater the discount!PERK 1: Get 44% discount on one canister.PERK 2: Get 50% discount on two canisters.PERK 3: Get 55% discount on three canisters. That's it. Cheerio.Shipping will commence early next year and we promise to ship by March 2018 at the latest! What's next?By backing this project, your help doesn't stop with bringing the first premium laundry Detergent for real Gentlemen to the market. The mission is much greater and you, Gentlemen, are helping with something much bigger here:PURE will become a brand! A brand designed to fit the needs of real Gentlemen. A brand designed to redefine the modern gentlemen. A brand to bring back the gentleman's codex that has been recently diluted.  Our team consists of very experienced entrepreneurs that have been working in the cosmetics sector for many years, generating millions of revenue.

</p><p>Our company came together as three people looking to make a
splash and intrigue the world with something exclusive. Something that was not
only standout, but something that was beautiful and even useful in people’s
lives. Our product, <b>Pappeal</b>, is constructed
from those intentions. Paper has never been quite so attractive, but we have
found a way to design something incredibly appealing from a paper-like
material, or ‘papel’ as we romance linguists would call it. That’s where we
derived the term <b>Pappeal</b>, and we
believe in the word to the highest level. We’re so excited about the distinct
product we’ve made -- and we are thrilled to share it with you.</p>

The look and distinctive features became iconic after the war ended, and that’s what inspired us to research this phenomenon further and develop our own wristwatch which draws on the best and most interesting details, converting them into a modern, attractive and fresh shape. Our goal was to create a military inspired wristwatch, but the most important thing was to make it stand out among other products.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1522679312/xrbivzqrn8hw3rbsutqu.png"" src=""""/></p><p>We were dazzled by the design of US military watches, German B-Uhr, and British WWW-class timepieces.

But also to integrate it into the lifestyle of a modern citizen, as well as make it worthy of any watch collection. ARMA watches meet all criteria for a matching contemporary timepiece, both from technical and aesthetic points of view.

Meet our ARMA watch project — a modern timepiece inspired by the most prominent military watches of the WWII era. We are fascinated by the amazing harmony of functionality and incredibly stylish design combined in a single timepiece offered by watchmakers for military purposes.All ARMA watches are produced already and ready for shipping! Simply place an order and get it shipped immediately. That's why, right now, we’re creating our own take on the retro military wristwatch with design is based on the pieces worn by US and European military men in the middle of the 20th century.The idea behind our project is obvious at the first look but challenging nevertheless. The look and distinctive features became iconic after the war ended, and that’s what inspired us to research this phenomenon further and develop our own wristwatch which draws on the best and most interesting details, converting them into a modern, attractive and fresh shape. Our goal was to create a military inspired wristwatch, but the most important thing was to make it stand out among other products.We were dazzled by the design of US military watches, German B-Uhr, and British WWW-class timepieces. Our collection strives to reflect on all the iconic models, to rework and revive them. However, we needed to start simply. So we combined their most classic and appealing features into two models – Sherman and Avenger.The Avenger takes inspiration from two sources. First, the grace and strict functionality of WWII era military wristwatches. Second, the aircraft dashboards of US and RAF jets and airplanes, such as produced by Lockheed, Hawker and Grumman. The model bears the name of the US heavy bomber Grumman Avenger.There are several crucial points we needed to emphasize in our watch to allow the spirit of the classic pilot watch to shine through. As a result, the dial offers precise time-telling through a sleek, clean design with contrasting indexes, a rounded layout, and 24-hour markings. The seconds dial design is based on dashboard supportive indication elements of WWII bomber planes.In the center of the dial is a large triangle which was used for quick orientation while in the air during military campaigns. The outer layer indexes are volumetric and covered with a lume coating. This special coating is a reflection of indexes made of luminous material that were common on vintage watches of the WWII era. The strap is stylized as a Kevlar fiber to strengthen the overall military look.The special edition Stealth Avenger watch has a slightly reworked dial with cream colored digits and hands which are common for vintage watches of the middle of the XX century. The case is worn out artificially to strengthen the vintage-like, yet incredibly stylish look. The strap is made of thick and rough stitched brown leather - the one that will survive through decades easily. The overall design palette is dark as a reference to hard conditions that military men meet through their service.The Sherman watch offers boldness and rough power in its design. It draws inspiration from Sherman, Valiant and Churchill tank instrument panels and also infantry timepieces of the mid-20th century.The dial offers a simplified layout with large, easily readable indexes on the hour layer and minute marks on the inner layer, granting accuracy necessary for your typical infantrymen. The differing layer finishings conceptualize the idea of the harsh varied environment which both infantry and tanks encountered.The seconds dial hand and other elements have a bold, massive structure resembling their source of inspiration. The lume coats the dial's applied volumetric digits and grants clear view even under challenging circumstances. The strap has texture and color similar to WWII flak jackets used by war machine pilots and drivers.The Valiant Sherman watch is a special edition model and designed to make Sherman model look even more vintage inspired and antique. The bronze case and is the center of it all in Valiant edition with its strong impressive looks supplementing ARMA's masculine design approach in such exquisite and fashionable way. This design feature is a gesture of respect and a reference to military decorations which are often made of bronze or coated with it.Military watches are a specific niche of watchmaking and watch culture. They have a grand history, clear and strict guidelines in a modern environment, and a lot of fans all over the world. We found the modern take on military timepieces currently available to be too gentle and shy, and there are too few projects that offer something really interesting in this area. That’s what served as a push for us in creating ARMA.So we started historical research on this matter, looking for old photographs, information and preserved watches to examine. All this was to create a watch that maintains strict yet charming and well-known design elements and make it appealing to the modern watch enthusiast. Of course, you can always buy a vintage watch, but we strive to create something that is stripped of the flaws inherent in a single collectible, improves its features, offers up-to-date technological quality and will become a desirable vintage watch itself.The conceptual idea behind ARMA watches is not to merely pay homage to classic military timepieces. But also to integrate it into the lifestyle of a modern citizen, as well as make it worthy of any watch collection. ARMA watches meet all criteria for a matching contemporary timepiece, both from technical and aesthetic points of view. Preserving the military chronometers' features, we managed to cover it in a sleek, up-to-date design which will look at home on every wrist, thanks to its universality and conceptual variety.But don’t think about us as of some kind of warmongering designers. ARMA is a totally anti-war project in its beliefs. We cast aside the circumstances that led to creation of military watches and drew inspiration only from the aesthetics. Our work is pure design and that helps us to inject our ideas into the modern look and lifestyle even easier, which results in one beautiful and stylish timepiece series that is an out of time accessory for everyone.ARMA watches are not simply a design product. We want to achieve the highest standards of quality with our watches, making it as close in durability and reliability as possible to their sources of inspiration.The watches are made of high-quality materials and geared with a reliable 17-jewel hand-winding movement. The back lid is transparent and offers a perfect view of the work of the movement, erasing a dividing line between functionality and ergonomic design.We wanted to maintain a strict ergonomic look even in the color palette and style of the strap. One is a smooth khaki suede, and the other is black with a kevlar-like structure. All straps are made of genuine cow skin by hand or from nylon and are strong and durable, which were tested by us before launching the campaign.The dial is another matter of exquisite attention to detail. Each model offers different layer finishing and significant depth in dial design. All hour indexes are volume and applied by hand with a bright luminous coating, sticking to the original military watch design with convex digits made wholly of lume material. Both second dials have a sunray texture. Main dials have a rough-grained surface as well, aiming to support a tough overall look for the watch.The development process turned out to be one of the most challenging parts of all. Our goal was to reimagine the most iconic watches and their features in a contemporary fashion. We studied a lot of timepieces of the past, both in person and through images, consulted the watch community and collectors, learned a lot about watchmaking, as well as on historical aspects of the subject. All of this was done to create something that fits perfectly into the industry for modern military watches.We began by developing each part of the watch manually — creating, calculating and thoroughly choosing every detail from scratch. We don’t use pre-made parts in our watches. Every smallest detail was specifically created for the watch in order to complete an authentic look and make this timepiece a product desired by watch enthusiasts for years to come.Another aspect we want to emphasize is movement. The technical side of the project is as vital for us as the design. We spent a lot of time choosing the proper movement mechanism to support our concept. While it was common for WWII era watches to sport simple in design yet reliable movements, we wanted to add something more elegant, beautiful and spectacular to the watch and make it more fashionable with a transparent back lid. That’s why we chose this movement — it offers a great look, is wound by hand, has proven to be reliable and precise, and helps us maintain an acceptable price.Both models have a case made of lightweight 316L stainless steel with a matt finishing. The back lid is also made of steel, has a transparent glass embedded in it, offering a great view of the movement. The movement is a Seagull TY 3620 with 17 jewels, and the watch construction grants 5 ATM water resistance. Each dial offers different layer finishings, gradating from a smooth to rough-grained surface and sunray finishing on the seconds dial.Case diameter: 44 mm Case thickness: 12 mm Band material: Genuine leather / Nylon Strap buckle: 316L Stainless steel Max / Min wrist size : 225 mm / 155 mm Band width: 22 mm Total weight: 65 gram Case material : 316L Stainless steel Crystal: Double Domed Sapphire Coated Water resistant: 5 ATM Movement: TY 3620 Hand Winding Mechanical Illumination: Super-Luminova BGW9We know that our watches aren't the cheapest available due to several of their distinctive features and the technological resources needed for the manufacturing process.

<p>My name is Jabbar Washington and I'm a 34-year-old shoe fanatic residing in Minneapolis, MN.

As the years have gone by I've  developed a passion for collection and display.<span><br/></span></p>
<p>Whatsnthatbox is a simple yet innovative way to organize, personalize, and upgrade even the most extensive shoe collections.  My own shoe collection can become overwhelming at times and like all collectors, I strive for organization and additions to my collection that will set it apart from my peers and their colletions.  It's extremely important to me to develop a product that is useful, personal, inexpensive, and fully customizable. </p>
<p>I wanted to create a platform to share my idea with people everywhere who own extensive shoe collections and have faced similar challenges.  I have a passion for shoes and want my products to reflect my passion at all times.   Your contributions will allow me to develop a high-end product that will appeal to all with a passion for shoes irrespective of gender, cultural background, or type of shoe collected. Funding will be distributed in the following areas: Web-design, marketing, and materials (printer, labels, ink cartridges).  This funding opportunity is integral to the overall success of whatsnthatbox.  I am looking to raise $6,000 to fund essential components of whatsnthatbox.</p>
<p>3,000  Design &amp; Materials</p>
<p>2,000  Web Design</p>
<p>1,000   Marketing</p>
<p>If my entire funding goal is not reached at this time, I plan to allocate funds to the areas listed above and continue raising funds to accomplish my business goals.</p>
<p>I would greatly appreciate any gestures that will assist me in accomplishing this goal.  Please spread the word to anyone you know who may be interested in this product.  Thank you!</p>

As an avid sports fan and athlete, I have been building and nurturing a deep love for shoes for as long as I can remember. As the years have gone by I've  developed a passion for collection and display.
Whatsnthatbox is a simple yet innovative way to organize, personalize, and upgrade even the most extensive shoe collections.  My own shoe collection can become overwhelming at times and like all collectors, I strive for organization and additions to my collection that will set it apart from my peers and their colletions.  It's extremely important to me to develop a product that is useful, personal, inexpensive, and fully customizable. 
I wanted to create a platform to share my idea with people everywhere who own extensive shoe collections and have faced similar challenges.  I have a passion for shoes and want my products to reflect my passion at all times.   Your contributions will allow me to develop a high-end product that will appeal to all with a passion for shoes irrespective of gender, cultural background, or type of shoe collected. Funding will be distributed in the following areas: Web-design, marketing, and materials (printer, labels, ink cartridges).  This funding opportunity is integral to the overall success of whatsnthatbox.  I am looking to raise $6,000 to fund essential components of whatsnthatbox.
3,000  Design & Materials
2,000  Web Design
1,000   Marketing
If my entire funding goal is not reached at this time, I plan to allocate funds to the areas listed above and continue raising funds to accomplish my business goals.
I would greatly appreciate any gestures that will assist me in accomplishing this goal.  Please spread the word to anyone you know who may be interested in this product.  Thank you!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3><em>The Collective</em></h3>
<p>Heart Beat Faster (HB) is a 3 dimensional lifestyle brand and statement rooted in the action sport and music industries.  With a history of competing by day and jamming by night, HB is built on that moment in which you feel most alive, 'a la ""what makes your heart beat faster?"".  Dedicated to integrating this heart-felt statement with the technicallity needed when pushing limits, you can be sure these headwear and apparel products will be unique, comfortable and will perform as well in the field as they will casually. </p>

<p>Here at Heart Beat Faster, we know how far the action sport and music world has developed and we can't wait to see what comes to be in the future.  This brand was developed to serve as a reminder of what was and what is to be, all while living today to the fullest.  From the laser etched wooden labels to the soft and quick dry material, these products stand as a salute to the pioneers and serve as a means to erasing the impossible. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>The absolute foundation of HB is built on guarding your heart above all else because it determines the course of your life.</em>  Part of the whole experience and what makes this a 3 dimensional project is sharing this passion with others while giving back to those who need a helping hand.  A percentage of product and sales will always be given in some form of charitable donation.  (Currently the local homeless shelter and given in the form of cold weather gear and food).</p>

Developing The EasyLockI had driven my family mad whilst creating functional prototypes in kitchen and even visiting potential manufacturers whilst on holiday. Now that the lock has been developed I have created a team to help make it become a reality. It is our intention to make The EasyLock a worldwide success.The EasyLock has had many iterations and we have continued to make alterations which I feel have benefited the aesthetics and the practicality of the lock until I arrived at the final design. For the production lock I have decided to edge the lock in a tactile plastic coating by doing so we will be able to prevent the possibility of damage to the door at the same time improving grip.   The EasyLock core is manufactured from chrome plated steel encased in an ABS plastic case with the functioning parts made from stainless steel.

Purpose:
The EasyLock has been created to provide a secure entry-prevention system for people staying in rooms or properties that they do not necessarily own. 
Hotel rooms, Rental Properties and University/College rooms can be made secure in seconds and subsequently the lock can be removed in an instant.

Every option I tried was either full of toxins, clumped in my pit fuzz, or left me stinky by midday. A few years back, I set out on a mission to create a deodorant that fulfilled my needs once and for all. The coconut oil-based formula I finally settled on was better than I could have ever expected: not only did my concoction completely prevent odor all day long, but it also made my underarm hairs (and skin) totally soft and smooth!</p><p>Whaaaa? Soft and smooth underarm hair? Is that even possible? Why don’t people talk about this?!</p><p>Despite the *bazillion* products available to keep women’s skin, nails, and head-hair looking and feeling healthy, there were ZERO products on the market providing the same courtesy to body hair.</p><p>So I started engineering my own body hair care products, and you know what? I ended up with softer pubic hair, fewer ingrown hairs, longer eye lashes, healthier brows, and smoother pit fur.</p><p>You know what else?

Our products are engineered to give you healthy, soft body hair that smells fresh, feels luscious, and looks beautiful.Our products make great holiday gifts! And we are shipping out perks by December 20.Don't want to wait for your pre-order to arrive? Come find us in person at one of these fine markets.If you want to remove your body hair, then you are in luck - there are billions of dollars worth of products on the market for you!If you want to care for the body hair you have, THEN YOU ARE ALSO IN LUCK! Because Harriette is launching the world’s FIRST line of body hair care essentials.OUR SIGNATURE PRODUCTSFRESH FUR | Natural DeodorantFresh Fur is chock full of nourishing ingredients that soften your #pitkittens, treat and prevent ingrown hairs, and moisturize your underarm skin. Plus, it doesn’t clump in your pit hairs and it actually works.MAGIC CARPET CLEANER | Pubic Hair ShampooJust like the hair on your head, your pubic mane needs to be cleaned, conditioned, and cared for.  Magic Carpet Cleaner uses a special formula of pure Castile soap and super-nourishing oils to gently clean and naturally moisturize your pubic mane, leaving you fresh and soft. BUSH OIL | Pubic Hair OilRub a few drops of Bush Oil into your pubic mane after your shower and experience softer, smoother hair and fewer ingrowns in just a few days.FRINGE BALM | Lash & Brow ConditionerFringe Balm is made with nourishing oils that moisturize, strengthen, repair damage, and stimulate growth for longer, thicker lashes and healthier brows. Plus, our balm provides shaping, separation, and definition - so you can look your best while treating your lil' face hairs right. CAN’T I JUST USE SOAP?Uhm, sure you could. You could also moisturize your eyelashes with body lotion and slap on some toothpaste as deodorant!But Harriette products are specifically engineered for your body hair - just as face lotion is engineered for your face, and chapstick is designed for your lips. INGREDIENTSWe understand that your body hair covers some of your body’s most vulnerable areas - including the eyes, genitals, and lymph nodes. That  is why we only use the gentlest, most natural plant-based butters, oils, and waxes  in our products. All-Natural    |    Vegan    |    Cruelty-FreeNO parabens. NO phthalates. NO sulfates. NO silicones. NO synthetic fragrance. NO coritsones. NO harsh chemicals.See our full list of ingredients at the bottom of this page. At Harriette, we believe that whatever body hair you do or don’t have shouldn’t impact how you (or society) interprets your femininity.Our mission is to reclaim body hair as a beautiful, clean, sexy, inherently feminine part of the body.We are creating products for a beauty revolution.Because in a society that works really hard to convince girls that they can never be pretty or desirable unless they remove their body hair, caring for your body hair is a radical act. IT ALL STARTED WITH DEODORANTAs a woman with underarm hair, I was never been able to find a good deodorant. Every option I tried was either full of toxins, clumped in my pit fuzz, or left me stinky by midday. A few years back, I set out on a mission to create a deodorant that fulfilled my needs once and for all. The coconut oil-based formula I finally settled on was better than I could have ever expected: not only did my concoction completely prevent odor all day long, but it also made my underarm hairs (and skin) totally soft and smooth!Whaaaa? Soft and smooth underarm hair? Is that even possible? Why don’t people talk about this?!Despite the *bazillion* products available to keep women’s skin, nails, and head-hair looking and feeling healthy, there were ZERO products on the market providing the same courtesy to body hair.So I started engineering my own body hair care products, and you know what? I ended up with softer pubic hair, fewer ingrown hairs, longer eye lashes, healthier brows, and smoother pit fur.You know what else? The act of nourishing, caring for, and generally paying positive attention to my body hair helped me learn to view it as a beautiful, feminine, sexy part of myself.That is why I founded Harriette: to teach women like me how to care, nurture, and celebrate our body hair. In the past year, I’ve gone from making products for myself, to starting a tiny Etsy shop, to running a full-blown e-commerce business. As the demand for Harriette products increases, our production and manufacturing must also scale. Crowdfunding will help us purchase the equipment and materials we need in order to ensure our production can keep up with demand.Our first $4.5k will be spent on production and fulfillment necessities such as a shipping label printer, an industrial mixer, and upgraded packaging.Any additional funding will go towards product development and marketing, so we can continue to grow and spread body hair love and acceptance! Bush Oil - Pubic hair conditioner.INGREDIENTS: Castor seed oil, golden jojoba oil, lavender oil and/or clary sage oil.Directions: Rub a few drops into your pubic mane after your shower and experience softer, smoother hair and fewer ingrowns in just a few days. Magic Carpet Cleaner - Pubic hair shampoo.INGREDIENTS: Coconut Oil, Olive Oil, Sunflower Oil, Aloe Vera, Shea Butter, Rosemary Oil.Directions: Lather.

He found a company in Korea willing to try the performance polyester on perforated neoprene, but because nobody had ever done that before, it took eight months for the company to figure out how to make it work.

It’s a great material that doesn’t feel too bulky and has a great formed-feel when you put it on.”— Ryan McMahon, Professional Baseball Player for the Colorado Rockies.</p><p>While waiting for the sleeve to be produced, Yarsin started to have players reach out and ask if he made other products or was planning to make other gear. Those inquiries became the business model for Yarsin and helped him start a catalog of other gear that has continued to grow.</p><p>“It’s a bit of a different business model because, reverse of what the big companies do, I wait for the players to ask me about something and put more money towards the product instead of making something and putting more money towards marketing. All requests for other products came before my signature product, the wrist sleeve, had come out, so I knew that would be the turning point,” said Yarsin.</p><p>For the compression apparel, Yarsin went through a process similar to the compression wrist sleeve by looking at fabric samples and figuring out which fabric goes where. For his base layer compression shirts, he opts for a super tech fabric and mesh underarms for additional cooling. His compression tights are lighter than competitor’s because “who wants to wear heavy tights under baseball pants in mid-July?”</p><p>Yarsin’s fabric supplier, a company in Honduras, is also moving towards converting their fabrics into a 100 percent recycled polyester.

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>It’s 4:20 am. I’m in the makeup room with less than 10 minutes to get into the studio to anchor the morning newscast. It’s crunch time. I've spent 5 minutes struggling to ram my microphone and IFB box down the back of my dress and hook them to my bra strap. For a moment, I consider tossing all my dresses and wearing a suit every day. Ugh! I wish there were a better way to do this. Praying I can actually wiggle the zipper of my dress over the bulky box, I feel uncomfortable, rushed, and self-conscious of the hump on my back. I’m starting my day, but already feel off of my game.</p>
<p>I'm Reba Hollingsworth, a television news anchor in Richmond, Virginia, and this has been my daily battle for more than 25 years. Different TV stations, different news positions...but the same ol' problem. Tons of women share in my frustration: TV personalities, business executives, church and political leaders, public speakers, restaurant managers, hair show stylists — anyone who needs to be mic’d up. Every day we attempt to answer the same question:<b> ""I'm wearing a dress, so where do I put my microphone?”</b></p>
<p>We've tried all kinds of DIY leg-wrap solutions: bandages, elastic hair ties, headbands, socks (yes, socks!), and even more humorous options. None of them solved the problem. The microphone eventually shimmies its way down to our ankles. What we needed was a leg wrap sturdy enough to hold a microphone and IFB box, but comfortable enough to wear for hours on the job and accessible enough for us to easily adjust it. </p>
<p>Instead of another failed DIY attempt, I invested time, energy, and financial resources into a more sophisticated solution for all of us. The AHA Wrap is strong but stylish, just like us. The heavy-duty elastic design, silicone band, and velcro closure keep it snug around the leg. Two rows of snaps give it an extra layer of security and adjustability. With the AHA Wrap, I don't have to worry about that embarrassing shimmy or someone reaching down the back of my dress to turn off the mike so I can go to the restroom. Because we all deserve to feel special and pampered, the AHA Wrap can be monogrammed in your favorite color and style for a personal touch! </p>
<p><strong>The Appeal</strong></p>
<p>My appeal is $10K from reporters, television personalities, public speakers, and the people who love them! The funds will be used for advertising the AHA Wrap and covering a portion of the shipment paid for out of personal funds. The funds from the campaign will help get my small business off the ground. I’ve dipped into my personal savings to cover the initial order and shipping fees. The finished product is flawless and already being used by a small number of TV women on air. So far, the feedback has been tremendous. One review in particular stands out:</p>
<p>“<b><i>What a game changing product!  It is so comfortable and well made!”</i></b></p>
<p>The funds from this campaign can help me reach even more women struggling to attach their microphone and to help us do our job.</p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>I like to believe I’m creating a small solution that solves a BIG problem for women like me. After all, we're working hard and trying to put our best faces forward during a time when it’s not the easiest thing in the world to deliver the news. We’re meticulously careful with our language, deeply committed to our work, and often confronted with emails, voicemails, and letters criticizing us for coverage or even our hairstyles or clothing choices! But despite the hardships that come with the job, I'm driven to do the best I possibly can. By supporting this campaign, you can show a little love for female reporters/anchors like me AND make our lives a little more comfortable! </p>
</div><div>
<p>I would truly appreciate your support of my campaign. A financial contribution isn’t the only way to help me reach my goal. I need your help spreading the word about my campaign. Word of mouth has been tremendous for my small business. Your support can take me to the next level. Be sure to use the Indiegogo share tools to help get the word out.</p>

By supporting this campaign, you can show a little love for female reporters/anchors like me AND make our lives a little more comfortable! 

I would truly appreciate your support of my campaign. A financial contribution isn’t the only way to help me reach my goal. I need your help spreading the word about my campaign. Word of mouth has been tremendous for my small business. Your support can take me to the next level. Be sure to use the Indiegogo share tools to help get the word out.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Why are we crowdfunding?</h3> <ul> <li>
<b> As a small company that strives to produce gear of the best possible quality, our goal is to keep manufacturing at our facility in Toronto, Canada.</b> In a global market that has not-so-slowly shifted production overseas, we continue to offer our customers locally-produced, handmade products, at a time when similar business models have all but disappeared. Additional capital from crowd-funding ensures that we can continue making this a reality.<br/>
</li> <li>Funding allows us to continue sourcing the highest-quality North American materials, while also giving us the opportunity to seek out innovative textiles and hardware to expand our product line. <br/>
</li> <li>We are always in need of more equipment to accommodate for growing demand. Crowd-funding allows us to keep up-to-date on equipment, giving us a competitive edge on those who outsource their production overseas. <br/>

<h2><strong><strong><em>The Impact</em></strong></strong></h2>
<p>LWD is a fashionable yet ethical cocktail and bridal label that proves looking beautiful and doing something beautiful for the environment are not mutually exclusive.</p>
<p>Your wedding day is an incredible and special day for you and your family. Unfortunately, many weddings are also not very environmentally friendly.</p>
<p>LWD endeavours to provide our brides, their bridal party and their attendants with fashion forward designs that are sustainable.</p>
<h3><em>The Impact on You, Us, and the World</em></h3>
<ul>
<li>We save fabrics and dresses from ending up in landfills and giving them a new lease on life</li>
<li>We make weddings less wasteful and more green</li>
<li>We provide an eco friendly choice without brides having to sacrifice style or luxury</li>
<li>Our dresses are appropriate to wear more than once and most can even be dyed another colour</li>
<li>We can take a sentimental garment and recreate it for you; incorporate your grandmother’s wedding dress into yours</li>
<li>You are supporting us in creating local jobs and keeping fashion production domestic</li>
<li>We have had a number of clients mostly online, now we want to make LWD and beautiful sustainable design much more accessible</li>
<li>Having a studio and boutique will allow brides and others to see their dress in person, meet face to face with the designers, and try their dress on before purchase</li>

<h2><strong><strong><em>Press:</em></strong></strong></h2>
<p>After graduating from Ryerson we partnered in 2010 and 2011 to produce two sustainable bridal collections under the label Little.White.Dress. which were presented at Toronto Alternative Arts and Fashion Week (|FAT|).</p>
<p>The collections shown at |FAT| were given positive reviews from numerous local fashion blogs such as She Does the City, appeared in the HuffingtonPost.com, were featured on slice.ca, and in 2012 was listed as one of the top 5 moments of |FAT| on the Toronto Standard.</p>
<p>Our Pleats and Ruffles dress was shot and featured in a post on Weddingchicks.com the wedding blog and recently a few of our dresses were featured in Press The Fashion Magazine.</p>

LWD is a fashionable yet ethical cocktail and bridal label that proves looking beautiful and doing something beautiful for the environment are not mutually exclusive.
Your wedding day is an incredible and special day for you and your family. Unfortunately, many weddings are also not very environmentally friendly.
LWD endeavours to provide our brides, their bridal party and their attendants with fashion forward designs that are sustainable.
The Impact on You, Us, and the World

We save fabrics and dresses from ending up in landfills and giving them a new lease on life
We make weddings less wasteful and more green
We provide an eco friendly choice without brides having to sacrifice style or luxury
Our dresses are appropriate to wear more than once and most can even be dyed another colour
We can take a sentimental garment and recreate it for you; incorporate your grandmother’s wedding dress into yours
You are supporting us in creating local jobs and keeping fashion production domestic
We have had a number of clients mostly online, now we want to make LWD and beautiful sustainable design much more accessible
Having a studio and boutique will allow brides and others to see their dress in person, meet face to face with the designers, and try their dress on before purchase
The Best Part...

Other Ways You Can Help
Spread the word!!
Link, post, and share our blog posts, pictures, statuses, and more! If you can't donate much you probably know someone who can so share the love!
Tell three friends!!
If you tell just three friends about LWD and our campaign, the impact for us is immeasurable but of course, you can tell more people! We don’t mind!
Recommend us!!
Tell your engaged friends, your friend with a wedding every weekend this summer, or the bridesmaid who can’t stand to have to buy and wear one more satin atrocity about us! We promise we aren't your typical bridal salon. 
Recommend us to the bride who wants to get bridesmaids’ dress that they can wear again (for real)
Donate ANY Amount:
If you don't have $10, $5 will do! Every little bit helps. And of course if you want to donate any other amount, we will give you all the perks up to that amount. We are eternally grateful for any and all of your support!

After graduating from Ryerson we partnered in 2010 and 2011 to produce two sustainable bridal collections under the label Little.White.Dress. which were presented at Toronto Alternative Arts and Fashion Week (|FAT|).
The collections shown at |FAT| were given positive reviews from numerous local fashion blogs such as She Does the City, appeared in the HuffingtonPost.com, were featured on slice.ca, and in 2012 was listed as one of the top 5 moments of |FAT| on the Toronto Standard.
Our Pleats and Ruffles dress was shot and featured in a post on Weddingchicks.com the wedding blog and recently a few of our dresses were featured in Press The Fashion Magazine.",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2>2 shoes in 1</h2>
<p>Do you wear high heels to work?</p>
<p>Do you have trouble walking down stairs in high heels?</p>
<p>How long can you wear high heels before your feet start screaming?</p>
<h3><strong>Switcheels is the Solution!!  They are 2 shoes in 1!!</strong></h3>
<h2><strong>High Heels that transform into flats. </strong></h2>
<div class=""description notranslate"">
<p>My <strong>Dad</strong> is my biggest inspiration. Together we want to make a<strong> revolutionary</strong> impact upon the <strong>shoe industry</strong>. <strong> </strong></p>
<p>We have <strong>perfected</strong> the design for a high heel shoe that easily transforms into a flat heel. Many people have attempted this but we have succeded!</p>
<p> In the flat position it is a <strong>better flat</strong> for your foot than your average flat shoe. That is, because it maintains a small arch which gives your foot better <strong>support. </strong></p>
<p>So when your feet start to hurt from those gorgeous high heels you love; you can reach down and <strong>click off</strong> your heels instead of kicking off your shoes.</p>
<h3>This is every womens dream fellas! If you really want to make your <strong>special lady</strong> happy and give her a gift that nobody has ever recieved make a pledge!</h3>
<h3>And ladies I know you are all shaking your heads in agreement :]</h3>
<p>This shoe would solve so many <strong>problems</strong> that <em>ordinary </em>high heels have created. Reaserch shows that women who wear high heels in the workplace develop long lasting health issues like corns, bunions, bad posture and back problems, also artheritus in the toes and anckles.</p>
<p>Even though high heels are hazardous to your health some professional jobs <strong>require</strong> women to wear a <em>minimum</em> of a 1.5 highth heel. Over time this is causing these woman alot of pain and inconvenience. Help improve the lives of so many women.</p>
<p>I <strong>hate</strong> carrying a spair pair of shoes when i wear high heels to a formal function. With switcheels your shoes will always match your outfit. You'll never have to go bearfoot after a night of dancing again.</p>
<p> Brides you<strong> </strong>can be the <strong>first</strong> bride walking down the isle in marvelous high heels and then sporting the same marvelous style at your reception.</p>
<p>I share this dream with <strong>every woman</strong> out there and I know that my Dad and I can produce a strong, (and adorable) convertable shoe.</p>
</div>
<p>We have final pricing, mold producers, shoe manufacturers, and final designs, and we're ready for production. All we need now is the <strong>funding</strong>.</p>
<p>So just ponder a minute and think how many women would love to own a pair of these. Make a pledge or contact us to team up or invest!</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>This is where you come in!</h2>
<h2><strong>You help us get us to our first step (pun intended)by making a pledge, and you get a pair of our Switcheels for half price. </strong></h2>
<p><strong>It's a WIN-WIN FOR BOTH OF US!!!</strong></p>

<p> </p>
<p>Dear friends and supporters,</p>
<p>My name is Karina Chasijeva. I am an active and motivated person who finished </p>
<p>her studies of the 7th semester of the international Fashion Design class at TEKO</p>
<p> in Herning in Denmark. I graduated with a Bachelor's Degree in December 2013</p>
<p> and now I want to launch my own menswear clothing line.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Within my project I have created a mini ``WODAABE`` menswear collection A/W </p>
<p>2015. In order to promote my brand’s vision I will be working with a creative team</p>
<p> of people such as photographer, videographer and models. We will produce a </p>
<p>commercial video that will help me reaching my target audience.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>With my creative team we are going to shoot a story behind my brand, send </p>
<p>uplifting and empowering message that will inspire you to go confidently in the</p>
<p> direction of your dreams. My clothing line will represent the power potions to </p>
<p>enhance that beauty, comfort, freedom and confidence which will support your </p>
<p>aspiration during your journey.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our video shoot and photo shoot will take place in Copenhagen in Scandinavian </p>
<p>locations and atmosphere which will be mixed with African cultural theme, a more </p>
<p>detailed description of our budget and process can be found below.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                              <strong>     Purpose of the project</strong></p>
<p>I have always been an artist! Through my life journey I was facing a lot of different </p>
<p>situations which allowed me to understand that I want to provide significance to</p>
<p> life. I always had problems with people who have dysfunctional lifestyle and</p>
<p> therefore I want to communicate with the world through my artistic visions in order</p>
<p> to foster for better and positive change.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Today I want to create a fashion line that represents the possibility of what can be</p>
<p> accomplished. Through our lifestyle, projects and simply stories, together we will</p>
<p> receive the knowledge of how to avoid obstacles in pursuing your goals, grow and</p>
<p> learn through the process of striving, regardless of what we attain. Life is about</p>
<p> creating yourself and building your own wall of confidence.</p>

<p>My inspiration has strong influences from three main sources which are:</p>
<p>-Hip hop 80's </p>
<p>-African culture</p>
<p>-Modern day street life estate trends</p>
<p>‘Wodaabe’ is perfect described brand name that connects my inspiration together</p>
<p> and creates a powerful story to get my target group on board of possibilities of my </p>
<p>visions.</p>
<p>‘Wodaabe’ name is coming specifically from one very special African tribe</p>
<p> ‘Wodaabe’ from Nigeria! They are known for their beauty both men and women, </p>
<p>elaborate attire and rich cultural ceremonies. Getting deeper in to their cultural</p>
<p> background I was very inspired by their spiritual strength and strong faith that </p>
<p>everything is possible even in poor surroundings and circumstances. That is what </p>
<p>inspired me to give my clothes more values and exude them with energy of endless </p>
<p>possibilities.</p>

<p>                                                           <strong>TARGET GROUP</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>For me, clothes are the support network for good comfort in your everyday</p>
<p> activities. Good designs stabilize your mood, attitude, functionality and keeps you </p>
<p>hype and stylish for the rest of your day. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I examine my target group from many angles. From a professional point of view</p>
<p> I am especially interested in their environment, experiences, passions and defining</p>
<p> moments.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For me, being a designer is all about customer service. I am interested in people</p>
<p> and their dreams, needs and comfort. As a designer, I find it important to develop</p>
<p> designs that speak to people. This job is about creative problem solving, with a </p>
<p>strong emphasis on understanding people and materials.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My own personal favorite designer is Astrid Andersen because I can very much</p>
<p> relate to her design universe. While being an intern of hers I got some good </p>
<p>knowledge and was able to attend her fashion shows of S/S collection twice in 2013</p>
<p> and 2014. She is very amazing and impressive Danish menswear designer that</p>
<p> creates athletic-inspired clothes with the twist of hip hop 80's feeling. We both </p>
<p>have same focus on letting our man feel hot and confident, because that is the true</p>
<p> ultimate attraction. However her designs are more than just exaggerating man's</p>
<p> beauty: it is also about the game! She provides powerful uniform with style for the</p>
<p> basketball game.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Astrid Andersen:</p>
<p>.''It’s a sport where they are a team, and the team spirit is so visible there, but it’s</p>
<p> also like a one man’s game at the same time. It’s about playing up to each other</p>
<p> and making one person shine. I love that whole mentality around that, they’re not </p>
<p>afraid to shine, and they’re not afraid to give room to make this other person really</p>
<p> just go for it.''</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Those references prove me that clothes speak about something more than just the</p>
<p> appearance: it is history, inspirational force and the push of your goals behind it.</p>
<p>Therefore with my designs I want to provide not only physical functionality but also</p>
<p> spiritual and mental functionality for my audience. Once you wear my designs they </p>
<p>will take you to endless experiences. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I talk a lot about functionality because it is a big part of my target audience dynamic</p>
<p> lifestyle. My designs are made for man from the age of 18-30, who consider being a</p>
<p> part of hip-hop cultural environment. He is very talented, confident, positive,</p>
<p> charming and thinking man who creates a fabulous use of his passion and skills.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                                            <strong>Video concept</strong></p>
<p>Within my video I will represent my designs, target group, lifestyle and the spirit of</p>
<p> ”Wodaabe’’ tribe. In the video I bring in together four very talented and charming </p>
<p>people whose energy will exude endless possibilities. It is all about inspiring you to</p>
<p> get out there and win. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our universe is full of beautiful people and some of them are surrounded by </p>
<p>tremendous struggles. We all have great plans, amazing ideas — but we just can’t </p>
<p>seem to launch them. Maybe we have constant money problems, difficulties with </p>
<p>relationships, weak self-esteem or emotions that drain our energy and enthusiasm.</p>
<p>How can we repair that and take you on the way to the top?</p>
<p>It is pretty simple and clear! Do not invite the broke in to your life! Do not longer</p>
<p> walk in to direction of dysfunction! Do not depend on someone telling you who</p>
<p> you are! Only you can decide what is best for you and DO it! And this is exactly</p>
<p> what our fashion video symbolize! We invite you to surround yourself with us and </p>
<p>we will tell you more about your blessings and increase your confidence.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Challenge yourself to do something a bit beyond your comfort zone to become the</p>
<p> self-assured ,successful and happy person inside you and my designs!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                                                   <strong>Film story:</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong> </p>
<p>The Idea of the video is to make a short film with different lifestyle forms that</p>
<p> combines a very spectacular side of hip hop 80's and the identity of ethnic </p>
<p>‘Wodaabe’ tribe.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>To create more artistic atmosphere we decided to stay away from a specific plan</p>
<p> or certain story. It is all about what is happening in different situations, and the</p>
<p> result of what happens speaks for itself in terms of the value and importance of it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For me as a menswear designer it is very important to emphasize man’s beauty,</p>
<p> charm and intelligence. Strong focus will be not only on my designs but also on</p>
<p> their looks, face expressions and the attitude! We also have a lady in the video to</p>
<p> represent that she is an active and important spectator. She is looking for her one</p>
<p> of a kind MR. ‘Wodaabe’! It simply represents traditional ‘Wodaabe’ importance of</p>
<p> impressing our female and for our female to make a right choice! There is a deeper</p>
<p> meaning of a man being judged by women! It speaks to us that our females have to </p>
<p>be smart judges, and have realistic decisions in order to have healthy relationships.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>While wearing my designs my models will invite you inside the moment of their</p>
<p> passions for you to see how far you can stretch it and in whatever direction move it.</p>
<p> That is why my designs have so much functionality and freedom to help you get out</p>
<p> there! </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I believe the best inspiration is to see something that is so powerful and fearless,</p>
<p> something that makes you feel uncomfortable and hungry! Because this is exactly</p>
<p> what stimulates your mind get down to work!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In my video with my designs I bring back the hip hop 80’s because this time period </p>
<p>is perfect illustration of the true hip-hop cultural essence. It was all about creativity,</p>
<p> peace, unity and inelegance! I simply oppose to mainstream artists who sacrifice</p>
<p> artistic integrity in the lure for more money and how they degrade woman. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The video itself is going to be very creative, spiritual and hype! It will raise a feeling </p>
<p>of certainty, happiness, strangeness and exoticism. If our film is not easy to</p>

Dear friends and supporters,
My name is Karina Chasijeva. I am an active and motivated person who finished 
her studies of the 7th semester of the international Fashion Design class at TEKO
 in Herning in Denmark. I graduated with a Bachelor's Degree in December 2013
 and now I want to launch my own menswear clothing line.
 
Within my project I have created a mini ``WODAABE`` menswear collection A/W 
2015. In order to promote my brand’s vision I will be working with a creative team
 of people such as photographer, videographer and models. We will produce a 
commercial video that will help me reaching my target audience.
 
With my creative team we are going to shoot a story behind my brand, send 
uplifting and empowering message that will inspire you to go confidently in the
 direction of your dreams. My clothing line will represent the power potions to 
enhance that beauty, comfort, freedom and confidence which will support your 
aspiration during your journey.
 
Our video shoot and photo shoot will take place in Copenhagen in Scandinavian 
locations and atmosphere which will be mixed with African cultural theme, a more 
detailed description of our budget and process can be found below.
 
                                                   Purpose of the project
I have always been an artist! Through my life journey I was facing a lot of different 
situations which allowed me to understand that I want to provide significance to
 life. I always had problems with people who have dysfunctional lifestyle and
 therefore I want to communicate with the world through my artistic visions in order
 to foster for better and positive change.
 
 Today I want to create a fashion line that represents the possibility of what can be
 accomplished. Through our lifestyle, projects and simply stories, together we will
 receive the knowledge of how to avoid obstacles in pursuing your goals, grow and
 learn through the process of striving, regardless of what we attain. Life is about
 creating yourself and building your own wall of confidence.
“Only he who can see the invisible can do the impossible.”

WODAABE

My inspiration has strong influences from three main sources which are:
-Hip hop 80's 
-African culture
-Modern day street life estate trends
‘Wodaabe’ is perfect described brand name that connects my inspiration together
 and creates a powerful story to get my target group on board of possibilities of my 
visions.
‘Wodaabe’ name is coming specifically from one very special African tribe
 ‘Wodaabe’ from Nigeria! They are known for their beauty both men and women, 
elaborate attire and rich cultural ceremonies. Getting deeper in to their cultural
 background I was very inspired by their spiritual strength and strong faith that 
everything is possible even in poor surroundings and circumstances. That is what 
inspired me to give my clothes more values and exude them with energy of endless 
possibilities.
 
                                                           TARGET GROUP

For me, clothes are the support network for good comfort in your everyday
 activities. Good designs stabilize your mood, attitude, functionality and keeps you 
hype and stylish for the rest of your day. 
 
I examine my target group from many angles. From a professional point of view
 I am especially interested in their environment, experiences, passions and defining
 moments.
 
For me, being a designer is all about customer service. I am interested in people
 and their dreams, needs and comfort. As a designer, I find it important to develop
 designs that speak to people. This job is about creative problem solving, with a 
strong emphasis on understanding people and materials.
 
My own personal favorite designer is Astrid Andersen because I can very much
 relate to her design universe. While being an intern of hers I got some good 
knowledge and was able to attend her fashion shows of S/S collection twice in 2013
 and 2014. She is very amazing and impressive Danish menswear designer that
 creates athletic-inspired clothes with the twist of hip hop 80's feeling. We both 
have same focus on letting our man feel hot and confident, because that is the true
 ultimate attraction. However her designs are more than just exaggerating man's
 beauty: it is also about the game! She provides powerful uniform with style for the
 basketball game.
 
Astrid Andersen:
.''It’s a sport where they are a team, and the team spirit is so visible there, but it’s
 also like a one man’s game at the same time. It’s about playing up to each other
 and making one person shine. I love that whole mentality around that, they’re not 
afraid to shine, and they’re not afraid to give room to make this other person really
 just go for it.''
 
Those references prove me that clothes speak about something more than just the
 appearance: it is history, inspirational force and the push of your goals behind it.
Therefore with my designs I want to provide not only physical functionality but also
 spiritual and mental functionality for my audience. Once you wear my designs they 
will take you to endless experiences. 
 
I talk a lot about functionality because it is a big part of my target audience dynamic
 lifestyle. My designs are made for man from the age of 18-30, who consider being a
 part of hip-hop cultural environment. He is very talented, confident, positive,
 charming and thinking man who creates a fabulous use of his passion and skills.
 
                                                            Video concept
Within my video I will represent my designs, target group, lifestyle and the spirit of
 ”Wodaabe’’ tribe. In the video I bring in together four very talented and charming 
people whose energy will exude endless possibilities. It is all about inspiring you to
 get out there and win. 
 
Our universe is full of beautiful people and some of them are surrounded by 
tremendous struggles. We all have great plans, amazing ideas — but we just can’t 
seem to launch them. Maybe we have constant money problems, difficulties with 
relationships, weak self-esteem or emotions that drain our energy and enthusiasm.
How can we repair that and take you on the way to the top?
It is pretty simple and clear! Do not invite the broke in to your life! Do not longer
 walk in to direction of dysfunction! Do not depend on someone telling you who
 you are! Only you can decide what is best for you and DO it! And this is exactly
 what our fashion video symbolize! We invite you to surround yourself with us and 
we will tell you more about your blessings and increase your confidence.
 
Challenge yourself to do something a bit beyond your comfort zone to become the
 self-assured ,successful and happy person inside you and my designs!
 
                                                                   Film story:
 
The Idea of the video is to make a short film with different lifestyle forms that
 combines a very spectacular side of hip hop 80's and the identity of ethnic 
‘Wodaabe’ tribe.
 
To create more artistic atmosphere we decided to stay away from a specific plan
 or certain story. It is all about what is happening in different situations, and the
 result of what happens speaks for itself in terms of the value and importance of it.
 
For me as a menswear designer it is very important to emphasize man’s beauty,
 charm and intelligence. Strong focus will be not only on my designs but also on
 their looks, face expressions and the attitude! We also have a lady in the video to
 represent that she is an active and important spectator. She is looking for her one
 of a kind MR. ‘Wodaabe’! It simply represents traditional ‘Wodaabe’ importance of
 impressing our female and for our female to make a right choice! There is a deeper
 meaning of a man being judged by women! It speaks to us that our females have to 
be smart judges, and have realistic decisions in order to have healthy relationships.
 
While wearing my designs my models will invite you inside the moment of their
 passions for you to see how far you can stretch it and in whatever direction move it.
 That is why my designs have so much functionality and freedom to help you get out
 there! 
 
I believe the best inspiration is to see something that is so powerful and fearless,
 something that makes you feel uncomfortable and hungry! Because this is exactly
 what stimulates your mind get down to work!
 
In my video with my designs I bring back the hip hop 80’s because this time period 
is perfect illustration of the true hip-hop cultural essence. It was all about creativity,
 peace, unity and inelegance! I simply oppose to mainstream artists who sacrifice
 artistic integrity in the lure for more money and how they degrade woman. 
 
The video itself is going to be very creative, spiritual and hype! It will raise a feeling 
of certainty, happiness, strangeness and exoticism. If our film is not easy to
 define it means I leave it for creative and imaginative people to draw their 
own interpretation around it!

At the time, everyone wanted a wing like this for their R53 MINIs, but no solution was available. As an R53 MINI owner/ enthusiast, I came up with an idea to make an affordable version so that every enthusiast would be able to purchase one. To date, we have delivered more than 150 GP wings and have received numerous positive feedback from our customers around the world. <p></p><p>Recently we have received a lot of emails regarding the availability of our GP Wing but unfortunately we no longer stock them in our inventory.

It will fit both R53 and R56 MINI without any modification to your rear hatch glass. Installation is straightforward and simple with all the provided mounting hardwares.</p><p>This is going to be your best opportunity to own a GP Wing at the lowest price ever.

<h2><strong>Say Good-Bye to Embarrassing Odour &amp; Perspiration Stains and Expensive Dry-Cleaning Bills!</strong></h2>
<p>We don’t wash our pants after every wear and that’s thanks to our undies!  But what about our shirts and dresses?  With nothing to protect them from damaging perspiration and antiperspirant stains, it means more costly trips to the dry-cleaners which is expensive and hard on our clothes.  Not to mention the embarrassment of odour and perspiration stains!  As women we have enough things to think about in a day that perspiration stains should not be one of them!</p>
<h3>
<strong>The Nudy Patooty Goal: </strong> To create a practical and comfortable undergarment solution for women to wear under their clothing to protect against embarrassing odour and perspiration stains, and reduce the frequency of laundering.</h3>
<p><strong>What causes perspiration stains?</strong>  Perspiration is mostly water, but the small percentage of other things - ammonia, sodium chloride, urea and lactic acid - are what cause the stains.</p>
<p><strong>What causes the odour?</strong>  Body odour is created when bacteria that is naturally found on the skin's surface reacts with moisture. Bacteria grows quickly in the presence of perspiration, especially if the pH balance of the skin is off or if moisture remains on the skin for a prolonged period. Shaving also contributes to bacteria growth because it removes hair which is used to wick perspiration away from the surface of the skin.</p>
<p><strong>Why isn’t antiperspirant enough?</strong> Antiperspirants do not prevent underarm perspiration they simply reduce the amount you perspire (the FDA requires antiperspirants reduce perspiration by 20% to meet standard guidelines, and 30% to be considered extra-effective).</p>
<p><strong>Do antiperspirants contribute to the problem?</strong> Yes. They use aluminum-based compounds that cause perspiration ducts to swell and block moisture from releasing. However these ingredients bond with perspiration and when they do escape they create stains.</p>
<h3><strong>Nudy Patooty's patent pending undergarments are specially designed to fit snugly to the body so they can be inconspicuously worn under almost any style clothing.</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>1) Fit: </strong></h3>
<p>As most women’s garments are fitted or made of a delicate fabric we recognize the importance of an undergarment fitting perfectly.  Nudy Patooty's pay special attention to detail to make sure they can be worn under most styles of clothing without being detected.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>No bulky sleeves:  </strong>The sleeves have been expertly tailored to lie flat against the arm so there is no extra fabric adding bulk.  </li>
<li>
<strong>Low neckline:  </strong>The neckline is cut low to the apex so the shirt can be worn under low or high neckline tops and dresses.  </li>
<li>
<strong>Delicate hem:  </strong>The hems have been finished with a delicate stretch lace to lie flat to the body.  </li>
<li>
<strong>Two sleeve lengths</strong>:  Two sleeve lengths each address different needs of different style garments.   Short sleeve, and three quarter length which hits just about the elbow and blends in with the creases naturally formed by your arm.</li>
</ul><p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/874365/pictures/full/20130616101222-NudyPatootie_SS13-174_WEB.jpg?1371402747"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>
<strong>2) Comfort: </strong> </h3>
<p>The perfect undergarment should be so comfortable that you don’t want to wear your clothes without one.  For this reason we have used a premium bamboo fabric.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Luxurious bamboo fabric:  </strong>The shirts are made of bamboo fabric, with a touch of Spandex for stretch, which is luxuriously soft against the skin.</li>
<li>
<strong>Anti-odour:  </strong>Bamboo fibers naturally have anti-bacterial properties and these properties stay in the fiber even after they have been processed into fabric.  Bamboo is also a renewable resource and no chemical pesticides are used.</li>
<li>
<strong>Regulates body temperature:  </strong>Bamboo fabric has micro-gaps, which aid in ventilation, meaning they trap cool air in the summer and warm air in the winter to regulate your body temperature. </li>
<li>
<strong>Super absorbent</strong>:  The porous nature of bamboo fabric also means it is three to four times more absorbent than cotton, allowing it to wick and absorb perspiration away from the body allowing you to stay dry and comfortable all day long. </li>
</ul><p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/874350/pictures/full/20130616095910-NudyPatootie_SS13-282_WEB.jpg?1371401956"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;""/></p>
<h3>3) <strong>Reinforced underarm:  </strong>
</h3>
<p>One of our main concerns is preventing embarrassing perspirations stains from damaging clothing (and confidence!), we have added an extra layer in the underarm.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>A reinforced layer in the underarm</strong> allows for extra absorption, wicking moisture away from your body and absorbing it into the shirt to prevent perspiration stains from leaking through.</li>
</ul><p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/874370/pictures/full/20130616101451-NudyPatootie_SS13-218_WEB.jpg?1371402896"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3><strong>What are the colours?</strong></h3>
<p>Both styles come in nude or black, which you can select after the project closes.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/874384/pictures/full/20130616102333-NudyPatootie_SS13-256_WEB_-_Version_2.jpg?1371403421"" src="""" style=""""/><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/874385/pictures/full/20130616102502-NudyPatootie_SS13-076_WEB.jpg?1371403507"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3><strong>How do Nudy Patooty's fit?</strong></h3>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/874392/pictures/full/20130616103054-Screen_Shot_2013-06-16_at_12.45.41_PM.png?1371403859"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3><strong>Why do YOU need to wear a Nudy Patooty?:</strong></h3>
<p>We all have enough things to worry about – whether it's a job interview, review with your boss, a first date, or trying to let loose with your girlfriends on a Saturday night – no one should have to worry about perspiration stains!  It is hard to feel and act like the fabulous woman you are while trying to conceal embarrassing perspiration stains.  Nudy Patootys will give you an extra layer of confidence!</p>
<p>Do you save your favourite clothes for a “special day” because you know you can only wear them once before they need to go back to the dry cleaners?  You bought your clothes to wear not look at in the closet!  A Nudy Patooty will get your favourite clothes back into regular wardrobe rotation without you having to worry about damaging them or what each wear is going to cost at the dry cleaners.</p>
<p>No matter how little you sweat, or how good your deodorant is, some materials are just more prone to perspiration and odour stains.  Or maybe your skin is sensitive to certain fabrics so you have avoided wearing them at all.  A Nudy Patooty fits perfectly under almost all materials.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/874390/pictures/full/20130616102824-NudyPatootie_SS13-130_WEB_-_Version_2.jpg?1371403712"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3><strong>The Story:</strong></h3>
<p>Nudy Patooty founder Michelle Shemilt was inspired to create an undershirt line when she realized she wasn’t wearing her favourite clothes either because they were prone to causing embarrassing odour and perspiration stains or they were dry-clean only which was costly! These are problems common to most women, and yet there was no practical solution available on the market, so Michelle set out to create the perfect undershirt. Her goal was to create an undershirt that could be worn under almost any style clothing to reduce the frequency of laundering, and most importantly prevent embarrassing odour and perspiration stains. Michelle felt women should be able to go confidently through their day in comfort, without sacrificing their style. In short, she wanted to create an extra layer of confidence! Michelle collaborated with a top New York manufacturer and pattern maker to develop the perfect fitting undergarment, and the Nudy Patooty was born!</p>
<h3><strong>We are ready to launch but need your help!</strong></h3>
<p>We are ready to start production but need your help to meet production minimums.  We are looking to raise $35,000 that will all go towards our first production run.  </p>
<p>Please help support our undergarment revolution by pre-ordering your Nudy Patooty today and wear an extra layer of confidence!  </p>
<h3><strong>Risks and challenges</strong></h3>
<p>We've spent the past six months working with a top manufacturer in NYC who has over 50 years experience in the garment manufacturing industry but we know there is still the possibility of hurdles along the way.  We will always share updates with our community about any challenges that may arise, including the following:</p>
<p>Ship date:  We've built in extra time for the production and are confident we'll ship by the estimated dates, but there is always a chance that things will take longer than planned.</p>
<p>Product:  We have worked diligently with pattern makers to get the fit of the undershirts perfect and to ensure everything is done to the highest quality and comfort standards.  But once we put the order into the factory for production we will go through one last set of samples and size grading so if any tweaks need to be made at that point than we will take the time to make the necessary corrections.</p>
<h3><strong>A special thank you to:</strong></h3>

<h2><strong>FAQ's</strong></h2>
<p><strong>When will my Nudy Patooty be ready?</strong></p>
<p>We are targeting an October delivery for all finished goods.  We've built in extra time for the production and are confident we'll ship by the estimated dates.  But once we put the order into the factory for production we will go through one last set of samples and size grading so if any tweaks need to be made at that point than we will take the time to make the necessary corrections.</p>
<p><strong>Are there any special care instructions for bamboo fabric?</strong></p>
<p>We recommend you wash your Nudy Patooty in cold water and tumble dry, just as you would any garment you want to last longer.</p>
<p><strong>When do I get to pick my size and colour?</strong></p>
<p>We will send you a link once the campaign has been completed where you will be able to select your desired size and colour.</p>
<p><strong>Do you plan on making additional styles and colours?</strong></p>
<p>Yes!  We appreciate that women have different style needs and have plans for additional colors, sizes and designs to address them.  We'd love to hear your feedback, so please share any particular garment problems that you have.</p>
<p><strong>How does Nudy Patooty help women in the community layer confidence?</strong></p>
<p>At Nudy Patooty we believe that having a strong support system is fundamental to layering confidence in women.  $1 of every Nudy Patooty sold is donated to a local women's shelter where women with no where to turn can find a safe, welcoming and supportive environment.</p>

Say Good-Bye to Embarrassing Odour & Perspiration Stains and Expensive Dry-Cleaning Bills!
We don’t wash our pants after every wear and that’s thanks to our undies!  But what about our shirts and dresses?  With nothing to protect them from damaging perspiration and antiperspirant stains, it means more costly trips to the dry-cleaners which is expensive and hard on our clothes.  Not to mention the embarrassment of odour and perspiration stains!  As women we have enough things to think about in a day that perspiration stains should not be one of them!

The Nudy Patooty Goal:  To create a practical and comfortable undergarment solution for women to wear under their clothing to protect against embarrassing odour and perspiration stains, and reduce the frequency of laundering.
What causes perspiration stains?  Perspiration is mostly water, but the small percentage of other things - ammonia, sodium chloride, urea and lactic acid - are what cause the stains.
What causes the odour?  Body odour is created when bacteria that is naturally found on the skin's surface reacts with moisture. Bacteria grows quickly in the presence of perspiration, especially if the pH balance of the skin is off or if moisture remains on the skin for a prolonged period. Shaving also contributes to bacteria growth because it removes hair which is used to wick perspiration away from the surface of the skin.
Why isn’t antiperspirant enough? Antiperspirants do not prevent underarm perspiration they simply reduce the amount you perspire (the FDA requires antiperspirants reduce perspiration by 20% to meet standard guidelines, and 30% to be considered extra-effective).
Do antiperspirants contribute to the problem? Yes. They use aluminum-based compounds that cause perspiration ducts to swell and block moisture from releasing. However these ingredients bond with perspiration and when they do escape they create stains.
Nudy Patooty's patent pending undergarments are specially designed to fit snugly to the body so they can be inconspicuously worn under almost any style clothing.
1) Fit: 
As most women’s garments are fitted or made of a delicate fabric we recognize the importance of an undergarment fitting perfectly.  Nudy Patooty's pay special attention to detail to make sure they can be worn under most styles of clothing without being detected.


No bulky sleeves:  The sleeves have been expertly tailored to lie flat against the arm so there is no extra fabric adding bulk.  

Low neckline:  The neckline is cut low to the apex so the shirt can be worn under low or high neckline tops and dresses.  

Delicate hem:  The hems have been finished with a delicate stretch lace to lie flat to the body.  

Two sleeve lengths:  Two sleeve lengths each address different needs of different style garments.   Short sleeve, and three quarter length which hits just about the elbow and blends in with the creases naturally formed by your arm.


2) Comfort:  
The perfect undergarment should be so comfortable that you don’t want to wear your clothes without one.  For this reason we have used a premium bamboo fabric.


Luxurious bamboo fabric:  The shirts are made of bamboo fabric, with a touch of Spandex for stretch, which is luxuriously soft against the skin.

Anti-odour:  Bamboo fibers naturally have anti-bacterial properties and these properties stay in the fiber even after they have been processed into fabric.  Bamboo is also a renewable resource and no chemical pesticides are used.

Regulates body temperature:  Bamboo fabric has micro-gaps, which aid in ventilation, meaning they trap cool air in the summer and warm air in the winter to regulate your body temperature. 

Super absorbent:  The porous nature of bamboo fabric also means it is three to four times more absorbent than cotton, allowing it to wick and absorb perspiration away from the body allowing you to stay dry and comfortable all day long. 

3) Reinforced underarm:  

One of our main concerns is preventing embarrassing perspirations stains from damaging clothing (and confidence!), we have added an extra layer in the underarm.


A reinforced layer in the underarm allows for extra absorption, wicking moisture away from your body and absorbing it into the shirt to prevent perspiration stains from leaking through.

What are the colours?
Both styles come in nude or black, which you can select after the project closes.

How do Nudy Patooty's fit?

Why do YOU need to wear a Nudy Patooty?:
We all have enough things to worry about – whether it's a job interview, review with your boss, a first date, or trying to let loose with your girlfriends on a Saturday night – no one should have to worry about perspiration stains!  It is hard to feel and act like the fabulous woman you are while trying to conceal embarrassing perspiration stains.  Nudy Patootys will give you an extra layer of confidence!
Do you save your favourite clothes for a “special day” because you know you can only wear them once before they need to go back to the dry cleaners?  You bought your clothes to wear not look at in the closet!  A Nudy Patooty will get your favourite clothes back into regular wardrobe rotation without you having to worry about damaging them or what each wear is going to cost at the dry cleaners.
No matter how little you sweat, or how good your deodorant is, some materials are just more prone to perspiration and odour stains.  Or maybe your skin is sensitive to certain fabrics so you have avoided wearing them at all.  A Nudy Patooty fits perfectly under almost all materials.

The Story:
Nudy Patooty founder Michelle Shemilt was inspired to create an undershirt line when she realized she wasn’t wearing her favourite clothes either because they were prone to causing embarrassing odour and perspiration stains or they were dry-clean only which was costly! These are problems common to most women, and yet there was no practical solution available on the market, so Michelle set out to create the perfect undershirt. Her goal was to create an undershirt that could be worn under almost any style clothing to reduce the frequency of laundering, and most importantly prevent embarrassing odour and perspiration stains. Michelle felt women should be able to go confidently through their day in comfort, without sacrificing their style. In short, she wanted to create an extra layer of confidence! Michelle collaborated with a top New York manufacturer and pattern maker to develop the perfect fitting undergarment, and the Nudy Patooty was born!
We are ready to launch but need your help!
We are ready to start production but need your help to meet production minimums.  We are looking to raise $35,000 that will all go towards our first production run.  
Please help support our undergarment revolution by pre-ordering your Nudy Patooty today and wear an extra layer of confidence!  
Risks and challenges
We've spent the past six months working with a top manufacturer in NYC who has over 50 years experience in the garment manufacturing industry but we know there is still the possibility of hurdles along the way.  We will always share updates with our community about any challenges that may arise, including the following:
Ship date:  We've built in extra time for the production and are confident we'll ship by the estimated dates, but there is always a chance that things will take longer than planned.
Product:  We have worked diligently with pattern makers to get the fit of the undershirts perfect and to ensure everything is done to the highest quality and comfort standards.  But once we put the order into the factory for production we will go through one last set of samples and size grading so if any tweaks need to be made at that point than we will take the time to make the necessary corrections.
A special thank you to:
Nadia Cheema for her amazing photography and Whitney at Spot 6 Management for being our beautiful model.
FAQ's
When will my Nudy Patooty be ready?
We are targeting an October delivery for all finished goods.  We've built in extra time for the production and are confident we'll ship by the estimated dates.  But once we put the order into the factory for production we will go through one last set of samples and size grading so if any tweaks need to be made at that point than we will take the time to make the necessary corrections.
Are there any special care instructions for bamboo fabric?
We recommend you wash your Nudy Patooty in cold water and tumble dry, just as you would any garment you want to last longer.
When do I get to pick my size and colour?
We will send you a link once the campaign has been completed where you will be able to select your desired size and colour.
Do you plan on making additional styles and colours?
Yes!  We appreciate that women have different style needs and have plans for additional colors, sizes and designs to address them.  We'd love to hear your feedback, so please share any particular garment problems that you have.
How does Nudy Patooty help women in the community layer confidence?
At Nudy Patooty we believe that having a strong support system is fundamental to layering confidence in women.  $1 of every Nudy Patooty sold is donated to a local women's shelter where women with no where to turn can find a safe, welcoming and supportive environment.

Let’s be real I’m not the most delicate person when it comes to how I treat my flip-flops. I’ve taken these bad boys through some pretty rough terrain. Mountain roads? Been there. Sunny beaches? Done it. Errands for the day? Success! These things just don’t give out. The reason? Natural Rubber is incredibly elastic and when mixed with the right balance of other natural ingredients to make the perfect latex compound it becomes super spongy. It’s this sponginess that allows it to maintain it’s structure and remain strong no matter what you throw at it.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1494853861/bs7b7ddsubjlgbyzlyla.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>photo credit: Leotie Lovely, @flaco_d_oro / Shane Woodward </p><p><strong>It’s super light-weight and freaking soft!</strong> Natural rubber has a silky smooth texture. The only thing I can think to describe it is silk. The stuff just feels like silk. Believe it or not, it actually looks like a perfect satin milk when it comes out of the tree. That definitely translates to more comfort on your foot. Between the cloud-like softness and the fact that they literally feel like they weigh nothing I often forget that I’m even wearing anything.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1494853995/raphx1flonzajot0xeso.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><strong>It automatically molds to your foot.</strong> This was an amazing discovery! We had been playing around with different natural rubber compounds that mixed the right amount of comfort and firmness to get through everyday life adventures. I knew we had it perfect when the flip-flops were molding to my feet but still able to provide enough support to wear constantly. This is due to the fact that we use a solid half inch of our special premium natural rubber compound recipe. This provides some really cool extra added benefits…</p><ul>
<li>
<strong><i>You get support exactly where your foot needs it!</i></strong> Because the natural rubber is conforming to the unique curves of your foot each flip-flop provides support exactly where your foot needs it most. This is no one size fits all. You could say natural rubber has built-in smart technology that just knows your foot’s needs.</li>
<li>
<strong><i>No more irritation between your toes.</i></strong> Raise your hand if you’ve ever worn a pair of flip-flops that irritated your toes in the area where the thong stretched between your big toe and your index toe? Go ahead I’ll wait. You can raise your hand. I learned - by the way - that part is called the “toe plug”. Get this, because our natural rubber compound provides just the right amount of soft conformity the toe plug actually molds into the shape between your toes. Which means there is no unnecessary rubbing. It’s the only way I could have worn them 200 days straight without losing all my skin!</li>

Whether you’re at the beach or just running errands around town.What is the secret ingredient?Premium grade natural rubber tapped directly from the finest rubber trees of Sri Lanka.Why natural rubber?Well it’s a good question… to be honest I didn’t know much about it either until I started this journey to make the perfect flip-flop.Here’s what I learned about natural rubber - specifically for footwear - over the past 2 years of developing the world’s best flip-flops...It’s incredibly durable! I’ve been wearing my flip-flops for the last 200 days straight. Let’s be real I’m not the most delicate person when it comes to how I treat my flip-flops. I’ve taken these bad boys through some pretty rough terrain. Mountain roads? Been there. Sunny beaches? Done it. Errands for the day? Success! These things just don’t give out. The reason? Natural Rubber is incredibly elastic and when mixed with the right balance of other natural ingredients to make the perfect latex compound it becomes super spongy. It’s this sponginess that allows it to maintain it’s structure and remain strong no matter what you throw at it.photo credit: Leotie Lovely, @flaco_d_oro / Shane Woodward It’s super light-weight and freaking soft! Natural rubber has a silky smooth texture. The only thing I can think to describe it is silk. The stuff just feels like silk. Believe it or not, it actually looks like a perfect satin milk when it comes out of the tree. That definitely translates to more comfort on your foot. Between the cloud-like softness and the fact that they literally feel like they weigh nothing I often forget that I’m even wearing anything.It automatically molds to your foot. This was an amazing discovery! We had been playing around with different natural rubber compounds that mixed the right amount of comfort and firmness to get through everyday life adventures. I knew we had it perfect when the flip-flops were molding to my feet but still able to provide enough support to wear constantly. This is due to the fact that we use a solid half inch of our special premium natural rubber compound recipe. This provides some really cool extra added benefits…

You get support exactly where your foot needs it! Because the natural rubber is conforming to the unique curves of your foot each flip-flop provides support exactly where your foot needs it most. This is no one size fits all. You could say natural rubber has built-in smart technology that just knows your foot’s needs.

No more irritation between your toes. Raise your hand if you’ve ever worn a pair of flip-flops that irritated your toes in the area where the thong stretched between your big toe and your index toe? Go ahead I’ll wait. You can raise your hand. I learned - by the way - that part is called the “toe plug”. Get this, because our natural rubber compound provides just the right amount of soft conformity the toe plug actually molds into the shape between your toes. Which means there is no unnecessary rubbing. It’s the only way I could have worn them 200 days straight without losing all my skin!

We had to go to great lengths to obtain it. Actually, we even went one step further than most that use rubber - we only use fair trade natural rubber. It took over 2 years even to just get all the suppliers in place but because of all this hard work up front we are confident that this is THE best material to create flip-flops.photo credit: Leotie Lovely, @flaco_d_oro / Shane Woodward Your foot doesn’t stand a chance at the beach all day, out with the kids on a Saturday, or through any other of life's daily toils without being supported by the finest quality materials.With the natural rubber from Sri Lanka’s finest rubber plantations we’ve worked with master artisans and rubber tappers to create the OLLI.But we didn't stop there.This story doesn’t end with the highest quality materials in any flip-flop... ever!Because, as I set out to find natural rubber to add to the perfect flip-flop I found myself in the countryside of India and the backwoods of Sri Lanka at rubber plantations. It was deep in these plantations the exploitative nature of the rubber industry became very clear.You wouldn’t believe the despair just to get a bucket of raw rubber.Workers living in the most despicable conditions, getting paid outrageously meager wages, and treated like the lowest of low.This reality is far worse than the harshness of bad chemicals or uncomfortable overpriced flip-flops.I wanted no part in this.So I set out to find rubber harvested on fair terms, rubber that cared for it’s people at every step of the process.That’s when the full idea for the perfect flip-flop was born.That's when Olli was born.photo credit: Simply Liv & CoThus began my journey to find natural FAIR TRADE rubber.Olli flip-flops would not only be better for the environment, but better for those involved in production.I joined the Fair Rubber Association, which means Olli only purchases rubber from audited plantations that maintain Fair Trade standards that include safe working conditions, medical care, and a fair wage. We pay a premium for our rubber which goes directly to the rubber tappers.A rubber worker cutting natural sheets of Olli rubberLike I said before, I’ve literally been wearing my Olli perfect flip-flops almost every day for the past 6 months - with the exception of the unforgiving Ohio winter; frostbite doesn’t need to be a part of this story.At first I was wearing them everyday just to test the true durability and then after about 3 months of non-stop wear they became an extension of my foot.Now the time has come to present to you the Olli perfect flip-flop; fit for - almost - every occasion.photo credit: Simply Liv & Co photo credit: Tara Tengphoto credit: Tara TengOLLI Special Indiegogo PackagesGet your pair of Olli flip-flops while the price is special. See the reward levels below and choose your reward on the right...   Every purchase changes a life. When you buy an Olli perfect flip-flop you’re buying more than just a flip-flop. You’re directly impacting the livelihood of the person that made the flip-flop.Like Sudhan.Sudhan is able to retire with an extra retirement fund provided by the monies directly provided by the Fair Rubber Association. Money directly related to the production of the Olli flip-flops.It’s not just an extra retirement fund that Sudhan is receiving. He also gets his very own rubber tree - to own for himself! This will provide him with an extra source of ongoing income as he is able to sell what he taps from the rubber tree, for profit.Rubber tappers like Sudhan are receiving similar generosities because of the consumers who buy fair trade rubber. Because of you!Other rubber tappers have received university scholarships, rebuilt schools for their children, infrastructure projects for deeply outdated villages, clean water wells, and much much more.You are making all of this possible.And we’re excited to partner with you to make it a reality.But listen... we're not just wingin' it!For the better part of two years we’ve been on the search to pinpoint quality and reliable partners to complete our natural rubber perfect flip-flop. Not only do we have the “making” part down to a science, we also assembled “shipping and logistics” partners that we’ve rigorously tested with numerous sample runs. With our supply chain tested and complete the only missing element to the chain is YOU. Here is the timeline you can count on to deliver your Olli perfect flip-flop to your feet.Let’s Change Flip-Flops Together And, while we’re at it, why not change the world together?! With less than the cost for a replacement charger to your iPhone - that you’ve lost for the countless time - you can help bring the first natural rubber flip-flop to life! The truth is, without you Olli can’t exist and we can’t champion the cause for fair trade across the rubber industry and hopefully across ALL industries in the near future. Let’s make brand consciousness a norm across fashion. Buy yourself a pair of extremely comfortable and simply stylish Olli perfect flip-flops.“For 8 days I lived in these shoes, escorting me on shopping trips, beach dates, and even an afternoon spent strolling on a boardwalk spotting manatees.The first thing I noticed was how much softer they felt than my other flip-flops.  Also, they were much more flexible and comfortable.  After wearing them for several hours I didn’t feel the fatigue in my feet that I usually get while wearing flip-flops.  I also didn’t experience the chaffing I usually do when breaking in a new pair of sandals.  It was like they were instantly broken in. Even while hiking on the boardwalk, which I typically wouldn’t do in flip-flops, I felt no discomfort.” - Natasha McKenty - Trybelle MagazineOLLI for ALLWe know you’re not alone.

<p> </p></figure></div><p>The science of posture is heavily researched and widely understood but the challenge has always been how to constantly maintain the correct posture while we go about our daily life. We know from our own experience and numerous studies that posture-related injuries among urban dwellers are usually caused by a long period of slouching in office chairs, the inability to rest during long commutes and shoulders strain from carrying heavy backpacks daily.</p><p> </p><div data-id=""22432258""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1539017209/golbnajahaflpa5iebot.png"" src=""""/></figure></div><p> </p><p>We created the LEX as a bionic chair that allows you to rest anywhere you want with a posture that creates a positive impact on your body. The way the LEX automatically adjusts your sitting posture is based on extensive research to create a natural resting position where the back remains upright while the thighs bend forward with the feet firmly planted on the ground to reduce the burden placed on the buttock. This position helps relax the muscles, encourage easy breathing and relieve pressure on the stomach.</p><p> </p><div data-id=""22440415""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1539017210/hisumc5pe0y53ly2jdu0.png"" src=""""/></figure></div><p> </p><p>This sitting position achieved by the LEX also gives the wearer higher mobility to shift between sitting and standing, making life less sedentary and more active.</p><p> </p><div data-id=""22441280""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1539017210/slz4kq8308jms0thjkyg.png"" src=""""/></figure></div><p> </p><p>Another key feature of the LEX is the innovative load-transfer module that shifts 50% of the backpack weight from the shoulders to the core of your body.</p><p>Backpacks cause more than the short-term strain on your shoulders while commuting, prolonged use of backpacks can create serious injuries and chronic pain. </p><p>To prevent this, the LEX load-transfer module works by extending a flexible panel upwards to hold the weight of the backpack and transfer it to the LEX unit worn around the waist. This lessens the load put on the shoulders and makes the backpack feels weightless, creating an amazing feeling of relaxation while you are on the move.</p><p>With these 3 main features designed specifically to enhance the wearer's posture, comfort, and endurance.

 The science of posture is heavily researched and widely understood but the challenge has always been how to constantly maintain the correct posture while we go about our daily life. We know from our own experience and numerous studies that posture-related injuries among urban dwellers are usually caused by a long period of slouching in office chairs, the inability to rest during long commutes and shoulders strain from carrying heavy backpacks daily.  We created the LEX as a bionic chair that allows you to rest anywhere you want with a posture that creates a positive impact on your body. The way the LEX automatically adjusts your sitting posture is based on extensive research to create a natural resting position where the back remains upright while the thighs bend forward with the feet firmly planted on the ground to reduce the burden placed on the buttock. This position helps relax the muscles, encourage easy breathing and relieve pressure on the stomach.  This sitting position achieved by the LEX also gives the wearer higher mobility to shift between sitting and standing, making life less sedentary and more active.  Another key feature of the LEX is the innovative load-transfer module that shifts 50% of the backpack weight from the shoulders to the core of your body.Backpacks cause more than the short-term strain on your shoulders while commuting, prolonged use of backpacks can create serious injuries and chronic pain. To prevent this, the LEX load-transfer module works by extending a flexible panel upwards to hold the weight of the backpack and transfer it to the LEX unit worn around the waist. This lessens the load put on the shoulders and makes the backpack feels weightless, creating an amazing feeling of relaxation while you are on the move.With these 3 main features designed specifically to enhance the wearer's posture, comfort, and endurance. The LEX opens a door to the future where human augmentation and improvement can be gained on-demand and off-the-shelf.  Hear it from our Beta Testers.
 
 
 Simplicity is the essence of our design philosophy. We want the LEX to be easy to put-on, wear and take off for a wide range of sex and age. It must be easy to put on as another piece of clothing.Many hours were spent to design the shape of the components and how to place them so it gives the wearer full freedom of movement. At the same time, we ensure that wearers can effortlessly put on the LEX.To wear the LEX, just 3 straps are needed to fits the LEX with your body just like a belt or backpack. When in folding mode, the LEX can barely be seen from the side.   To deploy the LEX in sitting position is beyond simple, our patent-pending Swiftsit technology is designed to let you sit down with a natural, perfect sitting from a folding position in 5 seconds.  When you want to be on your way, pull the LEX back up and fold it discreetly.To use the load-transfer module. Put on your backpack then wrap the load-transfer distribution module strap across your backpack starting at either side of your waist. Once the strap is fastened around your backpack, you will immediately feel the weight on your shoulders disappear.You can use the load-transfer module even while sitting so long queues won't hurt your shoulders. 
 The LEX also includes a hook for convenient hanging and the whole unit can be rolled up when not in use. 
  We want to build an exoskeleton that looks and feel cool, can stand up to 120 Kilogram (264 lbs) of weight, yet lightweight enough to be easily worn all day and realistic to manufacture with today's technology at an affordable price.The LEX exoskeleton is built from the ground up incorporating many advanced design elements to ensure that it can meet an uncompromising ergonomic requirement. The grooves and channel cut into the aircraft-grade aluminum frame helps reduce weight to a bare minimum but is meticulously calculated to maintain strength and integrity enough to withstand daily use. Non-allergic materials are carefully selected then manually grafted onto the frame. The thinnest and most comfortable memory foam were sourced and integrated into the seat to make sure every posture perfect moment is a comfortable one.
 The LEX is made to be safe and the sitting angle is recoverable, this means unlike traditional 90-degree body and thigh sitting posture, you can easily stand up should you lose your balance.Our team has spent the past decade delivering engineering hardware and software products to some of the world's largest companies and the best standards are maintained throughout the entire design and manufacturing process. 
 The LEX can be used every day in all types of scenarios as it constantly enhances your posture and comfort in a way no other wearable can. The LEX is your extra pair of legs whenever you want to sit and an extra set of shoulders whenever you have to commute. The only limit is where you want to go. 
 
  There has never been a more awesome way to sit and carry backpacks healthily and we want you to wear the LEX in your own way.Choose between 4 colors and 3 sizes to match your body type and lifestyles. Make the LEX stands out with bright, bold colors or picks a darker tone to make it blend effortlessly with your work cloth. 
 Our 4 colors, Titan Black, Yaksa Red, Jovian Orange, and Jotunn Blue makes the LEX not just an essential daily item, but also one of the coolest too! 
  We spent more than a year doing research and development, we have decided to launch when it was certain the LEX can be delivered to you safely, affordable and on-time.  The design has gone through multiple iterations and you can see some of them in our blogs and website. The LEX design represents the limit of what can be achieved with today's bionic chair exoskeleton technology. What we need now is to partner with you, our backers to reach a minimum order so our manufacturing vendor can begin production. After the production starts we will work to ensure that all orders are fulfilled within 12 to 16 weeks.We look forward to putting on the future with you. It is an honor and a privilege to be on Indiegogo. Thank you again for supporting us!",25.0,1,"2 Campaigns

<p>Feral cats can be found in every community, whether urban, rural or suburban.  No one knows exactly how many there are, but because they can survive in most climates and conditions, estimates in the United States alone run into the tens of millions.  Because they are mostly afraid of close contact with people, they are not suitable as pets and their typical fate when brought to an animal shelter is euthanasia.  At the same time, they are not completely wild and, though living outdoors on their own, they still rely on people for food and shelter from the elements.  Without this support, their lives are short and difficult.</p>
<p><br/>Trap-Neuter-Return, or “TNR,” is a way to help feral cats.  The cats are spayed or neutered, vaccinated against rabies, marked for identification and provided ongoing care in their outdoor homes by caretakers.  No longer able to reproduce, the cats’ numbers decline over time, lessening their impact on the environment.   The cats themselves, once fixed, are healthier and become better neighbors, making less noise and becoming less visible.   When enough of the cats are TNR’d in a community, their offspring no longer flood local shelters, thus bringing down euthanasia rates.  TNR is the most humane and effective approach to managing feral cats and is truly a community solution.</p>

The Coat

We proudly present you the Ragdoll Tabby Faux Fur Coat! Its soft white fur and black stripes were designed to represent the cute and ever-fluffy ragdoll tabby cat. 

Our coat is made of high-quality faux fur (ethically sourced as well!), with Storets' famous coat pattern that gives you a slim & feminine silhouette even though the coat is thick and cozy. 
The Neighborhood Cats Embroidery

Inside the coat, you can find a Neighborhood Cats logo embroidery at the right-hand bottom lining of the coat. Surrounding their iconic logo, we embroidered ""Save a Cat with Passion for Fashion,"" which is what you will be doing by buying this coat and wearing it around. The embroidery is done directly on the lining with high-quality silk thread, making a polished and luxury detail. People can catch a glimpse of this as you move around with the coat on or take it off, making it a good conversation starter. Go ahead and proudly flaunt it around, so the world can know that you helped save a cat. 

Our Shorthair faux fur clutch comes out in two colors - Tabby and Cream. It's named after - you guessed it ― a shorthair breed of cats. The soft texture and warm fluffiness will have you petting it on your lap all day! Just like a cat!

Hi. My name is Bo, the founder and CEO of Storets. Storets is an online fashion brand that provides sophisticated, yet fun clothes for women. 
I am an avid animal lover, and I make sure our brand shows this by shamelessly showing our faux fur items to be better than the real deal. 
This season, we partnered up with Neighborhood Cats, a charity helping feral cats, to make a coat that can actually save cats. Our limited-edition Ragdoll Tabby Faux Fur Coat was designed for cat-lovers who want to look stylish, while providing help to the cats in need. 

Other than the stylish black & white look and the stunning, luxurious faux fur, we added a not-so-secret embroidery in the inside of the coat that tells the world you saved a cat!


How can a coat save a cat?

It's quite simple! All of our proceeds from this coat will be going to our partner, Neighborhood Cats! If you buy one coat, you are directly funding a veterinary appointment for 1 kitten. With a purchase of one clutch, you are providing an insulated shelter that will keep 4 cats warm in the harsh winter weather. 


Storets is a women's fashion brand that promises you to deliver sophisticated yet fun clothing items to your doorstep. We've been in the fashion business since 2009, and in the meantime, we were able to dress some high-profile fashion gurus as well!

Feral cats can be found in every community, whether urban, rural or suburban.  No one knows exactly how many there are, but because they can survive in most climates and conditions, estimates in the United States alone run into the tens of millions.  Because they are mostly afraid of close contact with people, they are not suitable as pets and their typical fate when brought to an animal shelter is euthanasia.  At the same time, they are not completely wild and, though living outdoors on their own, they still rely on people for food and shelter from the elements.  Without this support, their lives are short and difficult.
Trap-Neuter-Return, or “TNR,” is a way to help feral cats.  The cats are spayed or neutered, vaccinated against rabies, marked for identification and provided ongoing care in their outdoor homes by caretakers.  No longer able to reproduce, the cats’ numbers decline over time, lessening their impact on the environment.   The cats themselves, once fixed, are healthier and become better neighbors, making less noise and becoming less visible.   When enough of the cats are TNR’d in a community, their offspring no longer flood local shelters, thus bringing down euthanasia rates.  TNR is the most humane and effective approach to managing feral cats and is truly a community solution.




 Neighborhood Cats began with one colony of feral cats in 1999 and has grown to become New York City’s primary resource for feral cat care, and a national and international leader in education and advocacy of TNR. 
On the ground in New York, Neighborhood Cats staff and volunteers have trapped, spayed or neutered and cared for tens of thousands of cats. The organization has taken the practical knowledge gained from their hands-on experience and created numerous educational materials, including books, videos and their website.  They have worked closely with manufacturers to create equipment especially designed for feral cats, such as traps and carriers, and provide scholarships to veterinarians to learn high volume spay/neuter techniques.  

Everything Neighborhood Cats does is aimed at making TNR the accepted, normal approach to managing feral cats everywhere.

<p><br/>GyroPalm is a patented wearable gesture-control system which is versatile, robust, and customizable. Essentially, GyroPalm gives meaning to hand motions and provides a platform for users to interact with known devices in new yet intuitive ways.</p>
<p>Our technology can be suitable for many people for leisure, convenience, and use in the industry. Most users such as gamers, home automation enthusiasts, developers, and the elderly would appreciate the flexibility provided by our gesture-controlled platform.<br/> </p>
<p><img alt=""GyroPalm Key Features"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://gyropalm.com/admin/uploads/key_feature_blocks.png"" src="""" style=""width:100%;""/></p>
<p><br/>The universal interface of GyroPalm revolves around gesture recognition. Hand gestures have been a medium of human-to-human communication for over a thousand years. GyroPalm aims to achieve human-device interaction through a language that is not spoken, but rather conveyed by motions which can be performed in either a subtle or explicit manner. Occasionally, gestures are a convenient way to quickly communicate with another person depending on the situation or location. Likewise, the same can be applied to controlling devices around your home or office in a pleasant and seamless manner.</p>
<p>Today, GyroPalm empowers you to interact with devices around you with single-hand gestures, even in noisy and/or dark environments. <br/> </p>

<p> </p></section><section><h2>FAQs</h2>
<p><span style=""font-size:16px;"">1. What gestures do I need to perform to control my home appliances?</span><br/><br/><strong>Answer:</strong> To control a device, users will typically perform a predefined activation gesture and then perform a navigation gesture or customizable gesture. These are very easy to learn and one can learn how to use GyroPalm within minutes.</p>
<p><span style=""font-size:16px;"">2. Do I need to learn many gestures to use this product?</span><br/><br/><strong>Answer:</strong> No, most users can adequately use GyroPalm through 4 or 5 simple motions which are rather easy. Additionally, users can customize more gestures as desired.</p>
<p><span style=""font-size:16px;"">3. Can I change my activation gestures?</span><br/><br/><strong>Answer:</strong> There are currently two activation gestures. Users can choose one of them based on their preference.</p>
<p><span style=""font-size:16px;"">4. How many gestures can be used with the GyroPalm?</span><br/><br/><strong>Answer:</strong> Ideally up to 6 customizable gestures at a time, in addition to the 4 preset gestures. Gesture performance and recognition may vary by the type of gesture set and the consistency when performing gesture recognition.</p>
<p><span style=""font-size:16px;"">5. How long does it take to convert my ordinary home into a smart connected home using GyroPalm?</span></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Using one of the GyroPalm packages, you can set up the home accessories within an hour or less in most cases.</p>
<p><span style=""font-size:16px;"">6. How long does it take for GyroPalm wearable to be charged?</span><br/><br/><strong>Answer:</strong> Between 3 to 5 hours to be fully charged.</p>
<p><span style=""font-size:16px;"">7. How long can GyroPalm battery last after a full-charge?</span></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Usually between 6 to 8 hours depending on your usage.</p>
<p><span style=""font-size:16px;"">8. What technology do you use to get GyroPalm work with other devices?</span></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Infrared, Bluetooth, Long-range, and WiFi.</p>
<p><span style=""font-size:16px;"">9. When do I need to use the base?</span></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Users should use the base for best performance in controlling drones outdoor (up to 3,000 feet).  For indoor operations, the base is needed to enhance performance when the router is too weak and/or the wall is too thick.  Developers can use the base for high quality and long distance transmission.</p>
<p><span style=""font-size:16px;"">10. When do I need to use WiFi?</span></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Users need to use WiFi with indoor operations.  With WiFi setup in advance, users can even control electronic devices in different parts of the world.</p>
<p><span style=""font-size:16px;"">11. Does GyroPalm use apps for operation?</span></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> For an ordinary user, he/she usually can adequately use GyroPalm with 4 to 5 motions without using apps, with the exception of the initial setup. But we do have Android and iOS apps which can provide advanced users with more services or functions.

GyroPalm is a patented wearable gesture control system for your wrist, unprecedented in the world, that empowers you to control electronics, computers, appliances, robotics, and IoT devices with a flick of the wrist! With our wearable, and in some cases with our base too, users can control devices and drones within 3,000 feet. With WiFi setup in advance, users can even control these items in different parts of the world. Our wearable also has most, if not all, of the functions of a typical smartwatch, such as step tracking, notifications, temperature indication, etc.
GyroPalm is the trend for tomorrow, the next-generation smartwatch! According to the editor of GadgetFlow, ""It's a connected smartwatch that is actually smarter than the rest."" 

There are three aspects of the product: a wristband, the GyroPalm cloud platform, and one or more hardware-based accessories. GyroPalm is easy to be used out of the box. Most people can adequately use GyroPalm through 4 or 5 simple preset motions. Moreover, you can create customizable gestures to be mapped to various actions as you desire.
For advanced users, GyroPalm features a dedicated IDE programming environment that allows them to extend the functionality of the wearable. 

 

 
 
 
Simplify your daily routines & enhance your lifestyle


GyroPalm is a patented wearable gesture-control system which is versatile, robust, and customizable. Essentially, GyroPalm gives meaning to hand motions and provides a platform for users to interact with known devices in new yet intuitive ways.
Our technology can be suitable for many people for leisure, convenience, and use in the industry. Most users such as gamers, home automation enthusiasts, developers, and the elderly would appreciate the flexibility provided by our gesture-controlled platform. 

The universal interface of GyroPalm revolves around gesture recognition. Hand gestures have been a medium of human-to-human communication for over a thousand years. GyroPalm aims to achieve human-device interaction through a language that is not spoken, but rather conveyed by motions which can be performed in either a subtle or explicit manner. Occasionally, gestures are a convenient way to quickly communicate with another person depending on the situation or location. Likewise, the same can be applied to controlling devices around your home or office in a pleasant and seamless manner.
Today, GyroPalm empowers you to interact with devices around you with single-hand gestures, even in noisy and/or dark environments.

 Risks & Challenges
For backers outside USA, please be responsible for taxes and duties as both Indiegogo and GyroPalm, LLC will not collect any tax and duty regardless.  
All devices are tested in our facilities to conform with FCC requirements. In terms of the wireless transmission of GyroPalm, compatibility may vary depending on environment. For example with very weak router and/or very thick wall, performance may not be perfect.  
We expect to start production early 2020 and anticipate to make our first shipment around November 2020. Throughout this time, our team will make the best effort to produce and test each of our products to ensure that supporters receive the best quality possible. Our wearable is designed and made in USA. We do not expect complications, though as with any technology product, delays in manufacturing or shipping may occur. However, our team is committed to delivering the product to you near the dates promised. In any condition where we face delay, we will update you on our website and via email. We are excited to bring you the best of GyroPalm and hope you will enjoy using our product as much as we do!
 FAQs
1. What gestures do I need to perform to control my home appliances?Answer: To control a device, users will typically perform a predefined activation gesture and then perform a navigation gesture or customizable gesture. These are very easy to learn and one can learn how to use GyroPalm within minutes.
2. Do I need to learn many gestures to use this product?Answer: No, most users can adequately use GyroPalm through 4 or 5 simple motions which are rather easy. Additionally, users can customize more gestures as desired.
3. Can I change my activation gestures?Answer: There are currently two activation gestures. Users can choose one of them based on their preference.
4. How many gestures can be used with the GyroPalm?Answer: Ideally up to 6 customizable gestures at a time, in addition to the 4 preset gestures. Gesture performance and recognition may vary by the type of gesture set and the consistency when performing gesture recognition.
5. How long does it take to convert my ordinary home into a smart connected home using GyroPalm?

Everyday millions of people sacrifice their health, education and economic opportunities searching for something many of us take for granted everyday.           We believe that together, we can help change that. Just $.63 can give someone water for a year. At Water Watch Company, we make sure that person can get clean water for much longer. For every watch sold, we will match that purchase with the funds to provide clean water to one person for their entire lifetime.         Become a part of ending the global water crisis.                           Become a part of redefining what it means to give, in business.    We are confident in the quality and craftsmanship of our watches. Each Water watch is backed by a five year warranty. We source only the best leather for our watches. With full-grain, vegetable tanned, Italian leather, you will reap benefits for years. Vegetable TanningOur leather comes from environmentally responsible tanneries in Italy that use a traditional method of tanning called vegetable tanning. This method is free of harmful chemicals and uses natural tannins from ingredients like tree bark. Vegetable tanning produces a natural look to the leather, is more sustainable, and helps age your watch strap beautifully over time.Full-grain At the tannery, hides are split and sold as different types of leather. The most durable, longest lasting of that material is called “full-grain” and is the outermost layer of the hide. All of our leather straps are made of full-grain leather.Our Beck Series watches feature an optional 316L Stainless Steel band. Upgrade at 50% off ($34.50) Indiegogo exclusive. (You can add this amount to your pledge to secure your order!)Our watches are packaged in finished wooden boxes with a velvet lining. Every watch comes with a certificate of authenticity that identifies and guarantees your timepiece. The standard premium watch is sold under the traditional distribution model (sales agents, retail stores, marketers) resulting in dramatic overpricing. By selling our watches directly to you, online, we can cut out the middlemen and provide fair and honest pricing. This leaves you with an affordable premium product, and our charity partners with the funds to do what they do best.Water timepieces are inspired by all forms of water. Lakes, oceans and rivers are made of this transparent, tasteless and colorless substance. Yet, it flavors and colors our world in every way. Our proximity to it changes the way we live, what we eat, how we move; everything begins with water. Our Harbor Series— A Harbor /ˈhärbər/ is a place on the coast where sea vessels find shelter from harsh waters. This watch pays homage to what we know best: minimal, elegant, clean design. We wanted this watch to be free of frills and distractions. Harbor is a place to call home. Our Channel Series— A Channel /ˈCHanl/ is a narrow part of the sea between a continent and an island. It is a passage for water to flow, a route for vessels to travel. This watch is inspired by connection. Sleek, and sophisticated, its luminescent hands serve as a bridge from light to dark, from place to place. Our Beck Series— A Beck /bek/ is a swiftly running stream with surface water flowing within the bed and banks of a channel. This watch is a bold, on the go, adventure seeking piece. Beck is inspired by the journey. Inspired by water, and created to give water.  Just .63 cents helps provide one year of clean water for one person. At Water Watch Company, with every watch sold, we provide the funding to give clean water to one person, for a lifetime.We've chosen to partner with the most transparent organizations working to solve the water crisis. With GPS tracking and site monitoring provided by our charity partners, we can share with you where we've helped give clean water. We will be issuing quarterly impact statements on our website and newsletters with details about: where, when, who and how, your watch has made an impact. Our first issue is planned for January 2019.A large part of our business model consists of our partnerships with suppliers that understand and support our cause. Without them we wouldn’t be able to do what we do. Together we’ve created amazing, affordable products that will impact communities around the world for years to come.  When selecting the finest materials for our watches, we were set on finding the best ways to showcase them through our designs. We went back and forth with our manufacturers on drawings, and 3D renderings. In the end we decided on what came natural to us: minimal, elegant, and timeless. Our Harbor series is of a fine and minimal aesthetic. These watches can be dressed up or down, ready for any occasion.

Short Summary
When you think of Brazil what comes to mind? Sunswept beaches, Rio de Janeiro, Bossa Nova music, or maybe partying during Carnival? I have created a collection of t-shirts inspired by my travels to this amazing country.

Hello, my name is John Smoot. I am an artist and I am passionate about Brazilian culture.
My campaign is to raise funds for the high quality professional web development of an Amazon.com e-commerce webstore. Since releasing a preview of just a few of my designs, there is already a high demand and excitement for the t-shirts.
Your support will enable the successful launch of a secure, trusted e-commerce webstore on Amazon.com capable of processing online sales orders worldwide.

Burks, I am 48 years old and I have been married 13 years.  My wife and I have four children.  I feel extremely Blessed as I have been given a second chance at life when I was cured of  stage four sarcoidosis.  I have always paid attention to detail in any job or responsibility I have been given. I am a keen observer and creative problem solver, I recognized a common problem and set upon designing a simple solution.  While vacationing at the beach with my wife and children, I had to carry a cooler plus chairs for the children, my wife and myself.  This entailed more than one trip from the car to the beach.  A conventional beach chair carried with a single strap over the shoulder does not stay in place well enough so the hands and arms are free for carrying other items.  Knowing this is a problem for many families who wish to enjoy their time at the beach or picnic without having to make multiple trips to haul gear, I Rodney J. Burks have come up with an innovative answer. The Easy Seat.</h3><h3></h3><h1><b>About my project</b></h1><p>The concept I envisioned is a way so anyone can carry multiple folding chairs at the same a time. The chairs will conveniently fold-up and connect together to form a backpack. A further, more detailed explanation of the functionality of this invention will be elaborated upon in the following segment.</p><p></p><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img alt="""" class=""fit lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/002/123/096/7d6b0fbbd82c7411b98b422166fec138_large.jpg?1402344010"" src="""" style=""""/> </figure><p></p><p></p><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img alt="""" class=""fit lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/002/123/102/3e677f43f46ff0f3d3c3d382d629744f_large.jpg?1402344086"" src="""" style=""""/> </figure><p></p><h1>How Does it Work?</h1><p>As currently designed in the technical drawings and 3-D models, the Easy Chair has unique features not presently available in the marketplace.  Although the system has not yet been engineered and is still in the 3-D developmental stages, an explanation of possible operation is as follows:</p><p>These folding chairs have two attached straps so it will stay securely in place when worn on the back like a backpack.  Like conventional chairs, these are lightweight and they each have cup holders in the arms and a detachable table that fits into the rear pocket when it is not being used.  This pocket is handy for storing almost anything the owner needs to store.  The side table connects at two points to provide stability.  Both connecting points have soft rubber grips inside for friction resistance and sturdy plastic support pins to hold it securely in place.   On the underside of the seat are rotating connection pegs which will lock one chair to another so multiple chairs can be carried together at one time.  This feature provides a strong and stable way of connecting the chairs. To make carrying the chairs on the back more comfortable and secure, an adjustable belt is fastened across the chest.  The back pocket provides a place for buyers to individualize their chairs with logos or advertising.</p><p></p><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img alt="""" class=""fit lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/002/123/109/c37ca32740723ae84ec646efa9f41b95_large.jpg?1402344153"" src="""" style=""""/> </figure><p></p><p>There are three accessories which can be purchased separately and fit into the rear pocket when not being used.  These items are a soft-sided cooler, a footstool, and a comfy neck pillow. The cooler connects with Velcro at two points on the top and an additional connection point on the bottom to hold it securely while in use. This cooler is large enough to carry a six pack of bottled or canned drinks or a small picnic lunch. The foot stool is uniquely designed to fold down completely and it connects to the chair at two points.  Locking pins keep the foot stool securely in place. The neck pillow is also uniquely designed with two connection points each with soft rubber and Velcro straps to hold in place while making the user very comfortable.</p><p></p><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img alt="""" class=""fit lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/002/123/112/122f3079615f9bc19d42bc3149f2b7ce_large.jpg?1402344187"" src="""" style=""""/> </figure><p></p><p>This chair design can be modified to make smaller chairs for children or heavy duty chairs for the military.

Burks, I am 48 years old and I have been married 13 years.  My wife and I have four children.  I feel extremely Blessed as I have been given a second chance at life when I was cured of  stage four sarcoidosis.  I have always paid attention to detail in any job or responsibility I have been given. I am a keen observer and creative problem solver, I recognized a common problem and set upon designing a simple solution.  While vacationing at the beach with my wife and children, I had to carry a cooler plus chairs for the children, my wife and myself.  This entailed more than one trip from the car to the beach.  A conventional beach chair carried with a single strap over the shoulder does not stay in place well enough so the hands and arms are free for carrying other items.  Knowing this is a problem for many families who wish to enjoy their time at the beach or picnic without having to make multiple trips to haul gear, I Rodney J. Burks have come up with an innovative answer. The Easy Seat.About my projectThe concept I envisioned is a way so anyone can carry multiple folding chairs at the same a time. The chairs will conveniently fold-up and connect together to form a backpack. A further, more detailed explanation of the functionality of this invention will be elaborated upon in the following segment.  How Does it Work?As currently designed in the technical drawings and 3-D models, the Easy Chair has unique features not presently available in the marketplace.  Although the system has not yet been engineered and is still in the 3-D developmental stages, an explanation of possible operation is as follows:These folding chairs have two attached straps so it will stay securely in place when worn on the back like a backpack.  Like conventional chairs, these are lightweight and they each have cup holders in the arms and a detachable table that fits into the rear pocket when it is not being used.  This pocket is handy for storing almost anything the owner needs to store.  The side table connects at two points to provide stability.  Both connecting points have soft rubber grips inside for friction resistance and sturdy plastic support pins to hold it securely in place.   On the underside of the seat are rotating connection pegs which will lock one chair to another so multiple chairs can be carried together at one time.  This feature provides a strong and stable way of connecting the chairs. To make carrying the chairs on the back more comfortable and secure, an adjustable belt is fastened across the chest.  The back pocket provides a place for buyers to individualize their chairs with logos or advertising. There are three accessories which can be purchased separately and fit into the rear pocket when not being used.  These items are a soft-sided cooler, a footstool, and a comfy neck pillow. The cooler connects with Velcro at two points on the top and an additional connection point on the bottom to hold it securely while in use. This cooler is large enough to carry a six pack of bottled or canned drinks or a small picnic lunch. The foot stool is uniquely designed to fold down completely and it connects to the chair at two points.  Locking pins keep the foot stool securely in place. The neck pillow is also uniquely designed with two connection points each with soft rubber and Velcro straps to hold in place while making the user very comfortable. This chair design can be modified to make smaller chairs for children or heavy duty chairs for the military. There could also be a high back version of this chair and that back would be adjustable.  All these chairs are designed so it is easy to carry multiple chairs at one time. The back of the chair could be imprinted with school logos or logos of various sports teams.    What Problem Does it Solve?The unique features of this invention will benefit the users in the following ways:
It will be much easier and less annoying carrying necessities to the beach, high school football games, parades, and parks for picnics, etc.
Multiple chairs can be carried at one time leaving your arms and hands still free to carry other things
These chairs are lightweight and have handy components
Excursions to places like the beaches, parades, parks for picnics, high school football games and for activities like hiking and fishing will be more pleasant for all
The attachable neck pillow, foot stool and cooler are convenient enhancements making the use of these chairs very enjoyable.
   MarketingI envision the Easy Chair appealing to the multitudes of people who enjoy spending time fishing, camping, hiking, relaxing on the beaches, etc. but don’t enjoy carrying all the necessities.  Today’s society is always seeking new ways to make our lives more convenient and this invention will certainly fit the bill.The markets are extensive for an innovative product like this one as people everywhere enjoy the convenience of these chairs.  General supply retailers like Target, Wal-Mart and K-Mart are logical retailers for this product as are many of the large drugstore chains like CVS, Revco and Walgreens as they sell these as seasonal items.  Other outlets could be places like Sports Authority and Toys R Us.  Close to beaches, lakes, parks and recreation areas there are always specialty stores which carry a wide variety of items for outdoor use and this would be a popular new product to sell there.I also wish to leave the market open for subsequent variances and possibilities that could improve the feasibility and marketability of this product, such as various designs or styles to suit user preference and necessity.   I have invested approximately $10,000 getting The Easy Seat to this point.

<p>Design is my passion....publicly and privately. I love creating, taking someone's dreams, visions, desires and passion and turning it into a visual identity and statement that's created just for them.

<p>My design campaign is now moving to the next level and I'd like to go from just designing to printing to make each project personal and complete. The impact on small business increases their visibility, gives them professional presence, and preserves their small budget. The impact on faith-based groups and organizations gives their vision and messages an appealing look that futher delivers their message to their audience. The impact to individuals (the family who has lost a loved one and needs a funeral program, or the couple who just wants their wedding invitation to be unique and special) meets their immediate needs but doesn't rob their wallets.<br/></p>

The Volo helps you organize all your gig and rehearsal stuff with intelligently designed form factor pockets. Your stuff always within reach and easy to grab when you need it!

STORY:
Ever miss an important phone call because you couldn't find your phone in your gig bag? Search in seemingly every pocket twice before finding your keys? Pull out your tablet or phone only to find the screen scratched? 
The Rockready Volo gig bag has you covered on all that and more. Never miss that important phone call or fumble for your keys again. Never worry that your tablet or other gadgets are not protected from unwanted scratches. And most importantly never worry about your guitar or bass if you 
accidentally drop the bag or it gets knocked over. We designed our 
Rockready Volo gig bag to be tour ready!

Rockready is a new concept in guitar accessories for the gigging musician: tour ready gear and also gives back to the music community.

<p><strong>Who is Operation Optimist?</strong></p>
<p>We are people, just like you, who desire to put more kindness, optimism, smiling faces, and love for one another back into the world, as well as expose the good that is already all around us. That is what our message and mission are all about. We know that there are plenty of people out there that feel the same and we want to build a sense of community around our brand and message, all while doing a greater good to help others in need through charitable acts. </p>
<p>Upon launching, our brand is initially the items you see here on Indiegogo. However, we have ideas for the future to keep our brand ever expanding and evolving and not being limited to the items you see here. </p>
<p><strong>What charitable acts is Operation Optimist performing? </strong></p>
<p>Our primary source of charity is with the wonderful non-profit, Children Incorporated. We will be donating 10% of all proceeds to this world wide child sponsorship organization. However, we will be focused on giving through other avenues as the company grows. </p>

<i><b>Our Plan</b></i><br/>
</h4><p>The funds raised through this Indiegogo campaign will be used to produce the first line of bags and help us cover some costs for R&amp;D of the new product lines next year.</p><h4>
<br/><i>Where will the money raised be spent?</i>
</h4><p>- €4500 for Manufacturing &amp; logistics<br/>- €2000 for R&amp;D of 2 new lines for Sprint 2014<br/>- €250 to cover Marketing material and our campaign costs<br/>- €250 for Company Overheads</p><h4>
<br/><i>The Design challenge</i>
</h4><p>Everyone is a unique individual, everyone’s daily habits and preferences are different. Even the best product won’t always please everyone.<br/>However, we have tried our best to analyse our friend’s life habits and aesthetic preference so we hope you will be one of the people who like our bags.</p><h4>
<br/><i>The Manufacturing challenge</i>
</h4><p>As we are such a baby start-up, our 1st batch of 1200 pieces is a very small order from the industry’s point of view.<br/>It has been difficult to find a small supplier who maintains high quality and delivers on time but we have a winning partnership and have been delighted with our samples!<br/>We hope to reach the right audience who will feel enthusiastic about the Insjö bag’s advantages and design just the way we do. <br/>If we achieve that, we will be on our way to providing Keeper Bags to the world.</p><h4>
<br/><i>Shipping time: </i>
</h4><p>Although we are based in Helsinki, Finland we have factored in the worldwide shipping prices already for your convenience.</p><p>Estimated to start shipping perks – Early Jan 2014<br/>Estimated time for you to receive your perks – Early Feb 2014</p><h4><br/></h4><h4>Thank you!</h4><p></p><p></p><p></p></div>","www.insjo.com

- €4500 for Manufacturing & logistics- €2000 for R&D of 2 new lines for Sprint 2014- €250 to cover Marketing material and our campaign costs- €250 for Company Overheads
The Design challenge
Everyone is a unique individual, everyone’s daily habits and preferences are different. Even the best product won’t always please everyone.However, we have tried our best to analyse our friend’s life habits and aesthetic preference so we hope you will be one of the people who like our bags.
The Manufacturing challenge
As we are such a baby start-up, our 1st batch of 1200 pieces is a very small order from the industry’s point of view.It has been difficult to find a small supplier who maintains high quality and delivers on time but we have a winning partnership and have been delighted with our samples!We hope to reach the right audience who will feel enthusiastic about the Insjö bag’s advantages and design just the way we do. If we achieve that, we will be on our way to providing Keeper Bags to the world.

<h2>A Few Words from the Creator</h2>
</div>
<div><em> </em></div>
<div><em>Today you read about rape in the newspapers almost every day. You become anxious and wonder why no one does anything about it. However, media is starting to focus more attention on the matter, more and more women step out and talk about it.

<div><em>Nevertheless, it is still the case that many women choose not to report abuse. They are ashamed, they are afraid of not being heard or risk being exposed to further violence. Often it is a case of word against word in a trial and it is difficult for a woman to win.

Did she have a history of multiple sexual partners? Did she say anything to lead him on? How did she first react to the situation?</em></div>
<div><em>The penalty for rape is very low. In a majority of cases tried, the accused will not be convicted. I believe the problem lies deeper than we think.

<div>On behalf of <em>Fashion Against Rape</em>, Nadja Björk hereby requests economic support for the ongoing development of the anti-rape buckle, an original design by Nadja Björk, founder and CEO of <em>Fashion Against Rape</em>.</div>
<div>We ask for an economic contribution of <strong>14 000 Dollar =</strong> <strong>80 000 SKR</strong>, but naturally, we appreciate any support we can get.</div>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<h2> Background</h2>
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>This product was invented in 2006 as part of a school project where students were encouraged to develop new innovations. The product is developed as a supplement to the two biggest anti-rape products on the market today, the panic alarm and protective spray. For different reasons, these two products do not always protect during an attack. For example, they may lie in an inaccessible hand bag, or they may have been left at home. They are hard to use and can, in many cases, be used against the woman.</div>
<h1>Why the product exist…</h1>
<div> </div>
<div>According to the American Medical Association(1995), sexual violence, and rape in particular, is considered the most under-reported violent crime.</div>
<div>The most common reasons given by victims for not reporting rapes are the belief that it is a personal or private matter, and that they fear reprisa<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reprisal"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">l</a> from the assailant. A 2007 government report in England says ”Estimates from research suggest that between 75 and 95 percent of rape crimes are never reported to the police.”</div>
<div>Fear of not being believed, not wanting to get their attacker – who is often known to them – into trouble and a sense that they could or should have avoided the assault mean only a fraction of rape cases are being reported.</div>
<div>·      Violence against women and girls is not confined to a specific culture, region or country, or to particular groups of women within a society. The roots of violence against women lie in persistent discrimination against women and girls.</div>
<div>·      According to data available at the time of this application being put together, up to 70 per cent of women experience violence in their lifetime,</div>
<div>·      According to World Bank data, women aged 15-44 suffer higher risk of becoming victims of rape and domestic violence than they risk cancer, car accidents, war and malaria, put together.</div>
<div>·      Every fifth women in the world is going to experience rape during their lifetime.</div>
<div> </div>

<h2>The Product</h2>

<div>
<img alt=""Product 2"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-BXmQt9n7qlU/UZ9SuqXF0kI/AAAAAAAAAJ4/0XdRlU8Izns/s1600/DSC_1916.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Product 2""/> </div>
</div>
<h3>
<br/>How does it work?</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The idea of the product is that wearing the belt will make it more difficult for the rapist to remove the victim’s pants!</p>
<p>The product consists of two laser cut metal plates. The plates are bent and formed into an additional buckle that attaches to the outside of your ordinary belt. In order to open it, you need to use both hands and move a button through a hidden labyrinth  witch, if you are not familiar with the design of the labyrinth, takes time. Some of the main features of the belt include:</p>
<p>·      Hard to open with one hand</p>
<p>This product is designed to be very difficult to open with one hand. This means the abuser cannot hold the women while trying to remove her pants.</p>
<p>·      Takes more time to open than a normal belt</p>
<p>The belt cannot be opened quickly. This gives the victim a chance to fight back, scream and use other products for protection.</p>
<p>·      Cannot be used against you</p>
<p>Unlike other products, such as pepper spray or stun guns, this product cannot be used against the victim.</p>
<p>·      Hidden Labyrinth for protection.</p>
<p>Hidden under the first layer of metal, is a labyrinth that you cannot see when the product is closed. That makes it very difficult to open the belt if you are not familiar with its layout.</p>
<p>·      Constant protection</p>
<p>Unlike a spray or an alarm, a belt is easy to remember bringing when you leave home. You don’t have to DO anything for it to help you. It’s just there, all the time.</p>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<h2>Easy to  Use… </h2>

<h3>The Makeup Frame ~Organize Your Beautiful Life~</h3>
<p><strong>I've always had a passion for creating products that simplify life. Maybe that's just a fancy way of saying that I'm always looking to make life just a little bit easier. I'm a product designer/inventor that's been living my passion for the past 15 years. I have created products such as Zen-ergy and The Jewelry Frame in the recent past. Now with this product, The Makeup Frame, I truly believe that it will help many. Not only has it saved me time (not that I mind waiting for my wife) But also money because my wife no longer unnecessarily replaces makeup products because she simply can not find it! Well Indiegogoers, I humbly Thank You for your time and support and I know this product will be of great use!</strong></p>

</div></div></div>","We are launching a special Indie GoGo project for five days only!
Our project for the iPad will only be available on Indie GoGo until Friday, December 9th! This is the last chance to become a backer for the Styló stylus and purchase it for only $15 dollars (+ $5 shipping).

Styló | Never a pen, Stylus by Nature
Why does a stylus have to be a pen? Your interaction with touchscreen devices is so much different from your interaction with paper. Your touchscreen device is so much more sophisticated than paper. Now there is a stylus that will match the sophistication of your device.
The Styló stylus is what you were looking for in a stylus. It was designed from the very beginning to be a stylus. Each aspect, from shape to materials, serve a function essential to the final design. By supporting our project you could be one of the first to receive a stylus that truly looks and functions as it should.















Styló | Why You Want It
There are some things your fingers just can't do. Sometimes you need precision and consistency that you can only get with a well designed tool. You don't finger paint your meeting notes, and you can't perform certain tasks with your fingers effectively on a tablet. It's very difficult to write notes or sketch effectively when you're just using your finger, therefore we designed the Styló stylus. Also, don't forget it's impossible to use your fingers when your wearing gloves!

The Styló stylus works with any capacitive touchscreen device. What devices are capacitive touchscreens? Pretty much any new touchscreen device is capacitive. Android, iOS, and Windows Phone 7 run on capacitive touchscreen devices, and the Styló stylus was designed for all of them. It's extremely responsive across all the devices we've tested!


Styló | Features

Rare Earth Magnets
The Styló stylus attaches to the screen of the iPad 2 with two rare earth magnets, it’ll even work with the Smart Cover. No pen clip and a streamlined design that’s comfortable and practical. It’s always with your tablet. There at your convenience.

Double Tip Design
We thought about how you interact with a tablet. It’s quick and intuitive and there’s no right or wrong way. That’s why you can just pick up the Styló stylus and interact, it’s as natural as using your finger. Don’t think, just draw.

Unique Design
Many say looks don’t matter, we disagree. Every element on the Styló stylus is there for a reason, both aesthetics and function. It’s an uncompromising designer stylus, yet affordable for everyone. Never a pen, stylus by nature.

Premium Materials
Only the highest quality materials and finishes were selected to provide you with the best possible stylus. High quality foam, anodized aluminum, and a rare earth magnet perform their functions flawlessly. No compromises, only the best.

Styló | Colors!
With your backing, you will get to vote on the first Styló stylus color that will be available! Check out our options below and select your favorite!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello! Thanks for visiting this project! Tanya Huang here. I'm the designer and founder of <strong>Knot Theory</strong> design house.</p>
<p>Last year I started a Knot Theory project on KickStarter, and it was a successl. Following that, Knot Theory and I had an amazing experience pitching on the reality TV show Dragons' Den (Can't disclose the outcome until it airs!) Following that, we've been in magazines, newspapers, and TV shows. Knot Theory has been worn by actors and TV hosts on the red carpet. Right now we are in 3 stores in Canada, and online we have awesome customers from 14 countries around the world!</p>
<p>This year, I'd like to give back through this <strong>""Pink it up! For the great women in your life""</strong> campaign. We officially partnered with Canadian Breast Cancer Foundation, and will donate 20% of proceeds to the Foundation. Breast cancer doesn't just effect women - it affects all of us! Imagine the women in your life getting cancer. It would shake your world up! It shook up my world when my dear friend and role model passed away last year from breast cancer.</p>
<p>I truly believe we can create a future without breast cancer, through better prevention and early detection. So let's Pink it up! For the great women in our lives!</p>

</p><p>Soft next to the skin, breathable and anti-static, it keeps you warm 
when the climate is cold yet releases body heat and moisture when it’s 
hot.

<p>It all started with one merino and some twentyish Lycra bike jerseys. Whether I was going for a run or a bike ride, if that merino jersey was available, it was the jersey of choice. Cool, highly moisture wicking and oh so comfortable to wear. ""Would this work in a tri suit?"" I asked myself multiple times.<br/></p>
<p>After saying and thinking along these lines for about two years, it was time to act. We sourced some fabric, had a couple of prototypes made and contacted some high level athletes to test the suits in race conditions.<br/></p>
<p>The feedback we received was unanimously positive and 
that’s where the journey began!</p><h3>How Can You Help</h3><p>We’ve been working on race apparel for over four years now. We've added some two-piece race kits, hoodies and some basic bike gear to the range. We have Kona Age Group champions that train and race in endurance Junkie and a growing customer base. </p>
<p>The feedback we have received from them has been incredible so far and now with your support we would like to continue to expand our product range.  <br/></p>
<p>As an endurance Junkie backer, you will help fund: </p>
<p>- Production of the summer bike training range.<span><br/></span>- Development and production of a full range of winter training gear, like winter tights, wind gilets and rain jackets.<span><br/></span>- Produce more tri suit color combinations so there is definitely one for you. <span><br/></span>- Design and production of casual pre and post race gear, like t-shirts, hoodies and caps.<br/></p><p><b>Men's Summer Bike Jersey's</b></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/533919/files/20140425134351-3.jpg?1398458631"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/533996/files/20140425141626-5.jpg?1398460586"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><b>And for the Ladies</b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/533920/files/20140425134425-4.jpg?1398458665"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Featuring a quarter-length zip with chin guard, 3 exterior back pockets with headphone cord pass-through and a silicone waist gripper, the jerseys are made from the same soft and light 20%-80% Merino/Polyester blend that is used in the Sportwool tri suits. They are ideal for Spring training rides but can also hold their own during long distance races in the hottest months of the year.<br/></p><p><b>The Sportive Bib Short</b><br/></p><p><b></b></p><p></p><p><b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/535810/files/20140426123540-8.jpg?1398540940"" src="""" style=""""/></b></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>The Impact</h3><p></p>Our reach only goes so far beyond our networks.

</div>","endurance Junkie started in 2010 from a profound passion for Ironman 
triathlon and the simple idea of developing the best and most comfortable
 triathlon suit possible. How?  By integrating the extraordinary 
properties of Merino wool.
Soft next to the skin, breathable and anti-static, it keeps you warm 
when the climate is cold yet releases body heat and moisture when it’s 
hot. So it helps athletes perform at their peak, whether it is in Hawaii or in Norway.The 2014 Sleeveless and Short Sleeved Sportwool Tri Suits“I like this Sportwool Suit….a lot! By using Sportwool, endurance Junkie are doing something unique, bringing high performance technology to the triathlon market.” (Daniel Ward – Everymantri.com)""Innovative tri-suit that performs superbly in open-water events. 91%"" (220 Triathlon Magazine)The 2014 HoodiesThe 2014 T-ShirtsWhy Did We Launch endurance Junkie
It all started with one merino and some twentyish Lycra bike jerseys. Whether I was going for a run or a bike ride, if that merino jersey was available, it was the jersey of choice. Cool, highly moisture wicking and oh so comfortable to wear. ""Would this work in a tri suit?"" I asked myself multiple times.
After saying and thinking along these lines for about two years, it was time to act. We sourced some fabric, had a couple of prototypes made and contacted some high level athletes to test the suits in race conditions.
The feedback we received was unanimously positive and 
that’s where the journey began!How Can You HelpWe’ve been working on race apparel for over four years now. We've added some two-piece race kits, hoodies and some basic bike gear to the range. We have Kona Age Group champions that train and race in endurance Junkie and a growing customer base. 
The feedback we have received from them has been incredible so far and now with your support we would like to continue to expand our product range.  
As an endurance Junkie backer, you will help fund: 
- Production of the summer bike training range.- Development and production of a full range of winter training gear, like winter tights, wind gilets and rain jackets.- Produce more tri suit color combinations so there is definitely one for you. - Design and production of casual pre and post race gear, like t-shirts, hoodies and caps.Men's Summer Bike Jersey'sAnd for the LadiesFeaturing a quarter-length zip with chin guard, 3 exterior back pockets with headphone cord pass-through and a silicone waist gripper, the jerseys are made from the same soft and light 20%-80% Merino/Polyester blend that is used in the Sportwool tri suits. They are ideal for Spring training rides but can also hold their own during long distance races in the hottest months of the year.The Sportive Bib ShortThe ImpactOur reach only goes so far beyond our networks. Liking us on Facebook, Twitter or sending a few quick emails to friends and family can go a long way to help us ensure success! Spread the word!We are aware of the risks that similar crowdfunding campaigns face. We have worked hard to put all the necessary logistics in place to avoid such occurrences.  If somewhere along the way we find that there is a setback in production, or that we cannot make meet the deadline, we will be as transparent as possible to keep all of our backers informed.In the end, we want to make endurance Junkie a long-lasting brand of top-notch endurance apparel. We will do whatever it takes to fulfill our promises and to deliver gear that will exceed our backers’ expectations.

So, we are working hard on this little business and have only one thing 
in mind: develop, manufacture and sell the best multisport and triathlon
 apparel available on the market, so that you can
 achieve YOUR sporting goals.
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

With all funds raised from this campaign I will be investing them in purchasing as many shirts, booty shorts, as possible.  It will also allow me to order the Rhinestones in bulk which would allow to better pricing.  I would love to be able to add non rhinestone designed shirts and boxers for men however on the budget I have at the moment it is just a dream. $1000 would also help me get the website up and running as well as help with marketing materials.<br/><br/>Believe it or not every little bit helps.<br/><br/><br/><p>By helping fund The Thick Shop you will be helping to raise the self-esteem of plus size women.  Not only will they have access to affordable clothing that is their size, they will also having clothing that represents them.  I would be able to hire models, photographer, makeup artist to put out some really nice promotional material.<br/></p>

<h3>The Story behind that exciting heated vest:</h3>
<div>
<p></p>Being from the Dominican Republic, I am used to 
living in a tropical paradise.  So you can imagine how shocking it was 
to experience my first winter in Germany!  Needless to say, no matter 
how much money I invested in staying warm, I just could not get used to 
the frigid temperatures.  Layering my clothing just made me look like a 
big puffy penguin.  Believe me when I tell you this was not the sexiest 
or most masculine image!  Plus, my pocketbook was becoming lighter and 
lighter as I tried without success to stay warm.  Although that first 
winter was tough, I actually enjoyed watching the snow fall to the ground
 for the first time.  There was something very beautiful about seeing 
ice-covered trees.  I realized if I was going to call Germany home, I 
would have to find a solution to my winter dilemma.
<br/><br/>For two years I put my nose to the grindstone working on various 
mock-ups of my ideal winter vest.  I knew it had to be lightweight, 
fashionable, and warm.  I had to avoid anything that seemed bulky or 
unattractive.  After much trial and error, and with the strong support 
of a wonderful team, the Heated Vest was born.  Weighing in at just 
under seven ounces, this vest can withstand temperatures as low as minus
 forty degrees Fahrenheit.  Because of its sleek design, the heated vest 
can be worn under your current winter gear.
How does it keep you warm?  The secret is the battery-operated heating 
system that is temperature controlled for your comfort.  The battery 
runs a full eighteen hours and is removable for washing.  Rather than 
adding bulk to the vest, the battery weighs less than a pound and tucks 
comfortably inside the vest without compromising design and style.  <br/><br/>As 
someone who has lived his whole life in a tropical climate, I assure you
 if this vest can keep me warm in the winter, it can keep anyone warm.  I
 invite you to join me in this investment journey as together we warm 
the world!<p><br/></p>

<h3>Risks and challenges:</h3>
<p>We believe that no one wants to see an excellent idea executed 
poorly, especially one called the Copertura Label fashionable heating 
jacket. We have worked extremely hard to get this product for Indiegogo.
 However, there could be things we might consider as risks:</p>
<p><b>MANUFACTURING:</b> We are dealing with only one manufacturer. They
 have capacity to produce over a thousand pieces a day. More colors we 
have more time it requests to process the vests.</p>
<p><b>FULFILLMENT: </b>To minimize the possibility of manufacturing 
setbacks, we will use express services. In case of a delay, we have an 
other manufacturer as a backup supplier for the garments.</p>
<p>We are working with a manufacturer who have many years of experience 
in delivering excellent products in tremendous quantities in a very 
short time. We have no doubt that something can happen, but obstacle 
will be addressed by combining our internal knowledge with external 
expertise, and providing the best possible fashionable heating jacket 
you, our first lovely customers.</p>

Regular winter jackets do not keep you warm. Luxury jackets are too expensive and do not keep you warm for long either. Existing heated jackets do not really work.


We brought you a fashionable Heated Vest which is for inner and outer use to ensure maximum thermal protection and performance with minimum weight addition. It keeps you warm and comfortable in cold environments while doing any kind of outdoor professional or leisure activities.

The Story behind that exciting heated vest:

Being from the Dominican Republic, I am used to 
living in a tropical paradise.  So you can imagine how shocking it was 
to experience my first winter in Germany!  Needless to say, no matter 
how much money I invested in staying warm, I just could not get used to 
the frigid temperatures.  Layering my clothing just made me look like a 
big puffy penguin.  Believe me when I tell you this was not the sexiest 
or most masculine image!  Plus, my pocketbook was becoming lighter and 
lighter as I tried without success to stay warm.  Although that first 
winter was tough, I actually enjoyed watching the snow fall to the ground
 for the first time.  There was something very beautiful about seeing 
ice-covered trees.  I realized if I was going to call Germany home, I 
would have to find a solution to my winter dilemma.
For two years I put my nose to the grindstone working on various 
mock-ups of my ideal winter vest.  I knew it had to be lightweight, 
fashionable, and warm.  I had to avoid anything that seemed bulky or 
unattractive.  After much trial and error, and with the strong support 
of a wonderful team, the Heated Vest was born.  Weighing in at just 
under seven ounces, this vest can withstand temperatures as low as minus
 forty degrees Fahrenheit.  Because of its sleek design, the heated vest 
can be worn under your current winter gear.
How does it keep you warm?  The secret is the battery-operated heating 
system that is temperature controlled for your comfort.  The battery 
runs a full eighteen hours and is removable for washing.  Rather than 
adding bulk to the vest, the battery weighs less than a pound and tucks 
comfortably inside the vest without compromising design and style.  As 
someone who has lived his whole life in a tropical climate, I assure you
 if this vest can keep me warm in the winter, it can keep anyone warm.  I
 invite you to join me in this investment journey as together we warm 
the world!

Risks and challenges:
We believe that no one wants to see an excellent idea executed 
poorly, especially one called the Copertura Label fashionable heating 
jacket. We have worked extremely hard to get this product for Indiegogo.
 However, there could be things we might consider as risks:
MANUFACTURING: We are dealing with only one manufacturer. They
 have capacity to produce over a thousand pieces a day. More colors we 
have more time it requests to process the vests.
FULFILLMENT: To minimize the possibility of manufacturing 
setbacks, we will use express services. In case of a delay, we have an 
other manufacturer as a backup supplier for the garments.
We are working with a manufacturer who have many years of experience 
in delivering excellent products in tremendous quantities in a very 
short time. We have no doubt that something can happen, but obstacle 
will be addressed by combining our internal knowledge with external 
expertise, and providing the best possible fashionable heating jacket 
you, our first lovely customers.

<li>I’m passionate about this website, and I’d love to grow the site!  The game of Magic helped me through some really tough emotional times, so I’d like to give back to the community.</li>
<li>Before I ran this site, I ran a local punk rock website from 1995 until 2008, which at it’s peak saw 10,000 registered users, and corporate backing from EMI/Capitol Records (you know… the label the Beatles and Rolling Stones were on!)</li>

<p>I have over 15 years of experience working in fashion and costume design.  From 1995 - 1997, I attended The Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising. While in school I fell in love with draping and manipulating fabrics, researching historical style, and hand embellishment needlework. I left those hallowed halls in Los Angeles with a deep passion for historical clothing recreation, as well as pattern creations of caprice. I continued my education, post FIDM, by attending countless costume conventions and classes that focused on everything from glove making to armor fabrication. After FIDM I began my company, Highgate Designs. I specialized in gothic club attire and custom crafted period, and fantasy, costumes.</p>
<p>In 2009, I took a hiatus from designing to relocate to the East Coast and rethink where my creativity wanted to lead me. I am now beyond excited to begin this new venture!</p>
<p>This campaign will help me focus my efforts, and help me to obtain much needed supplies and equipment,  in order to launch my line whole-heartedly!!</p>

My name is Stacy Hoopingarner Moreno - Designer/Creator/Ethereal Dreamer at Highgate Design from 1997 to present
I am working on the launch of my new endeavor …
Rococo Coquette
Artistry meets extravagance. Decadence mingles with imagination. Fashion enmeshes with fantasy. Whimsy is alive!
 
What Is Rococo Coquette?
*Fashion and accessories that promote merriment and opulence, intrinsically inspired by Marie Antoinette, and the Baroque and Rococo periods.
*Corsets, bodices, panniers, gloves, cuffs, ruffs, spats, armings, and stomachers, a possible endless array of delectable wonders.
* Finery created to be nothing less than whimsical, quirky, amusing, vibrant, fanciful, lavish and sumptuous!
All of my items are handmade and not mass produced, so each piece is a unique work of art.
 
Background
I have over 15 years of experience working in fashion and costume design.  From 1995 - 1997, I attended The Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising. While in school I fell in love with draping and manipulating fabrics, researching historical style, and hand embellishment needlework.

In 2009, I took a hiatus from designing to relocate to the East Coast and rethink where my creativity wanted to lead me. I am now beyond excited to begin this new venture!

<p>Our Team Members and Expert Consultants have more than 300 years of life experience and 150 years of business experience. Here's what we've learned:</p>
<p>-Most people enjoy celebrating with wine. Or sometimes, just the wine, without any official celebration. Or sometimes the act of drinking wine, in and of itself, qualifies as a celebration. </p>
<p>-Everyone wears clothing, at least some of the time.</p>
<p></p>
<p>-Everyone likes to have fun, most of the time.</p>
<p>-Everyone appreciates fair prices.  </p>

</h3>
<div>ABSOLUTELY NOT, other than to acknowledge the fact that we believe that HE was the greatest Sommelier the world ever knew. Yes, wine existed before HE did, but none of the previous Sommeliers from ancient times were ever able to make wine from water, were they? That's it. No preaching, no judging, and no guilt!! Just fun. </div>
<div>And we also believe that HE has another side, one that people didn't really get to see the first time around. A lighter, more creative side. You'll get to see that in the video series!</div>

<p>Often times, crowdfunding campaigns want pure charity to help the owners achieve their lifelong dreams.  We prefer to achieve our goals with a different strategy. Why not give people something of value for each and every ""contribution"". Now don't get us wrong; if there is a supremely charitable benefactor out there who would like to donate huge amounts of money and seeks nothing in return, feel free to do so! However, our business model will allow us to be successful by selling items and then reinvesting into our business in order to reach our goals.</p>

<h3>What We Need And What You Get:</h3>
<p>With your help, when we achieve our first funding level target of $47,500 USD, the remaining profit will enable us to purchase our own silk screening equipment and supplies. This will allow us much greater creative and administrative control of production and inventory, as we'll no longer need to rely on 3rd party shirt design makers and distributors. We already have the wheels rolling on the wine making and bottling part, and our first vintage will be ready in early 2015! </p>

</p>
<p>After this Indiegogo campaign ends and order fulfillment is complete, we'll allocate capital as shown in the chart below during the normal course of business operations. We'll monitor and assess our budget model quarterly (or more frequently, as required) to ensure efficiency.  <br/></p>
<p>Our first priority following the campaign will, of course, be order 
fulfillment to those who supported us here on our Indiegogo campaign! 
What you'll get are quality products that we believe have a value of at 
least as much as your contributions. You'll get to choose from a variety
 of great wines that we've created with the help of experienced 
winemakers from around the world. You can select from a vast array
 of shirts, tank tops, athletic wear, sweatshirts, and other apparel, 
all with original designs that reflect our brand of humor! We hope 
you'll agree that they are of great value. If you don't, we'd like to 
hear about it! </p>

<div><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Our product line already has proven appeal to adults all over the world. There may be some people who won't identify with our brand of humor (in which case we hope they love the wine enough to deal with it), but we believe that many will appreciate it. So for those of you who enjoy wine, wear clothing, or just like to laugh, welcome to SJ! In addition to extremely competitive pricing on wine and all-original apparel, we have a compelling spokesperson and story line that will keep you interested for years to come. Follow SJ through his many plights and adventures. Some of them will definitely surprise you; but mostly, they'll make you laugh. And if you don't know who SJ is by now, we suggest you go back to the top and watch our video. Another key factor that distinguishes us from other companies is that once we become profitable (estimated to be 12 months) we'll donate 10% of all profits to charity or other worthwhile causes. More information on this topic below.</span></div>

</div>
<div>
<p>We believe that if a company runs efficiently and profitably, there is a built-in social responsibility to help support people and communities in need.  We'll research various projects as well as charitable groups and organizations and present information for you, our members, to explore. We'll <span style=""background-color: initial;"">ask you to vote, and for other forms of input. We'll take member votes into account when deciding, semi-annually, which group or groups to support. We sincerely hope that you will choose to be a part of this decision making process or at least offer suggestions as you see fit! Of course there is no obligation to do so. If you choose to not be a part of this process, that's fine! Feel free to simply sit back and enjoy our products and follow the adventures of SJ! </span></p>

<h3>I'm Confused - Is It SommelierJesus Or SJ Rising? </h3>
<p>This discussion turned into a very heated debate between SJ and the management team, and didn't end well for the people in the suits. You'll get to see that video in the very near future, while this campaign is still running live. Thank goodness the cameras were rolling during that meeting, but be warned; it's definitely not for the faint of heart! Back to the original question; the simple answer is that both names are correct! For now, all you need to know (it's for your own safety) is that SJRising is a division within SommelierJesus. </p>
<div><br/></div>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What Impact Will Our Business Have On The World?</h3>
<p>We understand that this business will not be solving for some of the more pressing issues in the world today. It's unlikely that we'll be resolving Global Warming anytime soon. It's even less likely that we'll be able to help people overcome the financial issues our country faces at the moment. But here's what we <i>will </i>do in order to help to make the world a little better:</p>
<p>1) We'll provide you with high quality, affordable products (wine, apparel, and humor) that, when used responsibly, will help to make you feel or just stay happy.</p>
<p>2) We'll treat you with respect.</p>
<p>3) We'll treat our employees with dignity.</p>
<p>4) We'll donate to charities that really do use the money for its stated cause; not for administrative costs or ridiculously large Executive salaries.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges:</h3>
<p>Here are some of the risks we are aware of:</p>
<p>1) People may stop drinking wine or wearing clothes, but these both seem unlikely. </p>
<p>2) Extreme weather conditions- In the event of unusually extreme weather, grape production, processing, or shipping could be impacted. In order to mitigate some of this risk, we are partnering with producers in various parts of the world, where weather conditions will also vary from one to the next. </p>
<p>3) The ever changing regulatory and compliance environment surrounding the issue of home delivery of alcoholic beverages. We are staying on top of these issues with our legal team and others in the industry. We fully support the idea of making sure that these beverages don't get into the hands of underage or otherwise irresponsible consumers, but we also fully support the idea that responsible adults should be able to order and receive these items through home delivery if they so choose. Our founding team and our expert consultants have a great deal of experience and success in navigating through the sometimes tricky waters surrounding government compliance issues, as well as the general challenges associated with starting up any business. </p>
<p>*As of now, we know we won't be shipping wine directly to consumers in the states of MS, PA, or UT. If you do purchase a Perk that includes wine and you live in one of these states, or other states that have regulatory issues that impact our ability to ship, we will contact you to discuss other options.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Our initial funding target will be a great momentum builder for the future of our company, and we thank you in advance for helping to accomplish it! We also believe there is a broader opportunity here, with your generous support. When we surpass the initial goal (either through this campaign or through other venues), here are our plans after the completion of order fulfillment:</span></div>
<div>$100K- We'll purchase silk screening supplies and equipment, which will be a great help to complete order fulfillment quickly and effectively.</div>
<div>$200K- We'll be able to commit to a significantly larger volume of wine with our vineyards and producers, which will allow us to purchase at lower price points and pass those savings along to you, our members. </div>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">And if by chance we fall short of our initial funding target, the funds that we do receive will be used for order fulfillment as the first priority, before anything else.</span><br/>

</div></div>","A Summary Of What We Know:
Our Team Members and Expert Consultants have more than 300 years of life experience and 150 years of business experience. Here's what we've learned:
-Most people enjoy celebrating with wine. Or sometimes, just the wine, without any official celebration. Or sometimes the act of drinking wine, in and of itself, qualifies as a celebration. 
-Everyone wears clothing, at least some of the time.

-Everyone likes to have fun, most of the time.
-Everyone appreciates fair prices.  
If you can relate to any of the statements above, read on!
 
Why The Name ""SJ""? 
The video below addresses this complex question. There's much more to the story, and it will unfold in the coming weeks (and further down in this campaign)! 





Is This About Religion?

ABSOLUTELY NOT, other than to acknowledge the fact that we believe that HE was the greatest Sommelier the world ever knew. Yes, wine existed before HE did, but none of the previous Sommeliers from ancient times were ever able to make wine from water, were they? That's it. No preaching, no judging, and no guilt!! Just fun. 
And we also believe that HE has another side, one that people didn't really get to see the first time around. A lighter, more creative side. You'll get to see that in the video series!



This Pre-Sale Event Will Get Us Off The Ground With A Running Start - It's Not A Fundraising Event

Often times, crowdfunding campaigns want pure charity to help the owners achieve their lifelong dreams.  We prefer to achieve our goals with a different strategy. Why not give people something of value for each and every ""contribution"". Now don't get us wrong; if there is a supremely charitable benefactor out there who would like to donate huge amounts of money and seeks nothing in return, feel free to do so! However, our business model will allow us to be successful by selling items and then reinvesting into our business in order to reach our goals.


A Simplified Guide To The Perks: 
Perks #1, #2, & #3 are for original videos and/or membership discounts.
Perk #4 is the lowest cost Perk that includes a T-shirt or tank top.
Perk #5 is the lowest cost Perk that includes wine.
Perk #6 is the least expensive way to get both wine and a T-shirt or tank top.
Perk #8 gets you wine, a T-shirt, & a tank top with Executive logos.
Perk #9 - 12 gets you wine, a T-shirt, a tank top, and a bunch of other great stuff. Please read individual Perks for details!

Apparel Designs Currently In Production:
Note: These are just a few examples of our original designs. We are working on many more that will contain either the SJ Rising or the SommelierJesus logos! The campaign perks feature T-shirts and tank tops. After the campaign ends and orders are filled, our website will feature many more apparel types for sale, such as active and workout wear, sweatshirts, hoodies and more. We'll send updates as they become available! You can view these shirts, front and back, and other designs on our website slideshow on the products page  http://www.SJRising.com

                         
  
 


First Vintages In Production:Robust red and white blends, Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, with more to come next year and beyond!



What We Need And What You Get:
With your help, when we achieve our first funding level target of $47,500 USD, the remaining profit will enable us to purchase our own silk screening equipment and supplies. This will allow us much greater creative and administrative control of production and inventory, as we'll no longer need to rely on 3rd party shirt design makers and distributors. We already have the wheels rolling on the wine making and bottling part, and our first vintage will be ready in early 2015! 

What Happens After This Campaign?

After this Indiegogo campaign ends and order fulfillment is complete, we'll allocate capital as shown in the chart below during the normal course of business operations. We'll monitor and assess our budget model quarterly (or more frequently, as required) to ensure efficiency.  
Our first priority following the campaign will, of course, be order 
fulfillment to those who supported us here on our Indiegogo campaign! 
What you'll get are quality products that we believe have a value of at 
least as much as your contributions. You'll get to choose from a variety
 of great wines that we've created with the help of experienced 
winemakers from around the world. You can select from a vast array
 of shirts, tank tops, athletic wear, sweatshirts, and other apparel, 
all with original designs that reflect our brand of humor! We hope 
you'll agree that they are of great value. If you don't, we'd like to 
hear about it! 


                   
Where Can I Get Products After This Campaign?
Our website is active right now. At this time, the Products page will direct you back here to our Indiegogo campaign. When the campaign ends, you'll be able to order items directly from our website.

How Are We Different Than Other Companies?
Our product line already has proven appeal to adults all over the world. There may be some people who won't identify with our brand of humor (in which case we hope they love the wine enough to deal with it), but we believe that many will appreciate it. So for those of you who enjoy wine, wear clothing, or just like to laugh, welcome to SJ! In addition to extremely competitive pricing on wine and all-original apparel, we have a compelling spokesperson and story line that will keep you interested for years to come. Follow SJ through his many plights and adventures. Some of them will definitely surprise you; but mostly, they'll make you laugh. And if you don't know who SJ is by now, we suggest you go back to the top and watch our video. Another key factor that distinguishes us from other companies is that once we become profitable (estimated to be 12 months) we'll donate 10% of all profits to charity or other worthwhile causes. More information on this topic below.


Why And When Will We Donate 10% Of Profits?


We believe that if a company runs efficiently and profitably, there is a built-in social responsibility to help support people and communities in need.  We'll research various projects as well as charitable groups and organizations and present information for you, our members, to explore. We'll ask you to vote, and for other forms of input. We'll take member votes into account when deciding, semi-annually, which group or groups to support. We sincerely hope that you will choose to be a part of this decision making process or at least offer suggestions as you see fit! Of course there is no obligation to do so. If you choose to not be a part of this process, that's fine! Feel free to simply sit back and enjoy our products and follow the adventures of SJ! 



I'm Confused - Is It SommelierJesus Or SJ Rising? 
This discussion turned into a very heated debate between SJ and the management team, and didn't end well for the people in the suits. You'll get to see that video in the very near future, while this campaign is still running live. Thank goodness the cameras were rolling during that meeting, but be warned; it's definitely not for the faint of heart! Back to the original question; the simple answer is that both names are correct! For now, all you need to know (it's for your own safety) is that SJRising is a division within SommelierJesus. 



What Impact Will Our Business Have On The World?
We understand that this business will not be solving for some of the more pressing issues in the world today. It's unlikely that we'll be resolving Global Warming anytime soon. It's even less likely that we'll be able to help people overcome the financial issues our country faces at the moment. But here's what we will do in order to help to make the world a little better:
1) We'll provide you with high quality, affordable products (wine, apparel, and humor) that, when used responsibly, will help to make you feel or just stay happy.
2) We'll treat you with respect.
3) We'll treat our employees with dignity.
4) We'll donate to charities that really do use the money for its stated cause; not for administrative costs or ridiculously large Executive salaries.


Risks & Challenges:
Here are some of the risks we are aware of:
1) People may stop drinking wine or wearing clothes, but these both seem unlikely. 
2) Extreme weather conditions- In the event of unusually extreme weather, grape production, processing, or shipping could be impacted. In order to mitigate some of this risk, we are partnering with producers in various parts of the world, where weather conditions will also vary from one to the next. 
3) The ever changing regulatory and compliance environment surrounding the issue of home delivery of alcoholic beverages. We are staying on top of these issues with our legal team and others in the industry. We fully support the idea of making sure that these beverages don't get into the hands of underage or otherwise irresponsible consumers, but we also fully support the idea that responsible adults should be able to order and receive these items through home delivery if they so choose. Our founding team and our expert consultants have a great deal of experience and success in navigating through the sometimes tricky waters surrounding government compliance issues, as well as the general challenges associated with starting up any business. 
*As of now, we know we won't be shipping wine directly to consumers in the states of MS, PA, or UT. If you do purchase a Perk that includes wine and you live in one of these states, or other states that have regulatory issues that impact our ability to ship, we will contact you to discuss other options.
    A Happy Consumer With Our First Endorsement:
         By the way, we promise to do our best to ensure that our next endorsement appears in a wide screen format instead of the vertical setting. Remember that our budget was EXTREMELY limited for this, our first-ever commercial. The actress has another career besides acting, and was willing to accept pay in the form of barter; more specifically, a bottle of wine. Please remember, Rome wasn't built in a day ;)

Stretch Goals Beyond Our Initial Target:



Our initial funding target will be a great momentum builder for the future of our company, and we thank you in advance for helping to accomplish it! We also believe there is a broader opportunity here, with your generous support. When we surpass the initial goal (either through this campaign or through other venues), here are our plans after the completion of order fulfillment:
$100K- We'll purchase silk screening supplies and equipment, which will be a great help to complete order fulfillment quickly and effectively.
$200K- We'll be able to commit to a significantly larger volume of wine with our vineyards and producers, which will allow us to purchase at lower price points and pass those savings along to you, our members. 

And if by chance we fall short of our initial funding target, the funds that we do receive will be used for order fulfillment as the first priority, before anything else.




  
Ok, I'm In.  

Great!  Please take a look at our Perks. You'll need to scroll back up and they'll be on the right hand side in a long column. Find the ones that best suit you, and order!

Other Ways To Help, Even Without Contributing:
Some people just won't be able to contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help. If any of this campaign, its products or goals or general style resonates with you in the least, but you simply can't afford to contribute anything, even the lowest cost Perk, please become an advocate!  Perhaps you could even send a private or public message about our campaign to your friends, or share or tweet about it on your favorite social media outlet. Chances are there are tons of folks just like you who would champion this cause if they knew about it. 
Please remember one other thing; if friends of yours orders something from us through our Referral Campaign (will begin at about the halfway point of this campaign) you get rewarded! The more they order, the bigger your rewards. So becoming an advocate will do more than just help us; it can also help you!

There are 3 things I need. 

 A bigger vacuum pump 


 A bigger Plexiglas plate 


 Some materials to get started 


Vacuum pump A strong vacuum pump is vital to assure that the silicone doesn’t contain air bubbles.My current pump takes 1/2h to degas the silicone. That's way too long!The silicone starts to harden after half of the time and get too thick/firm.Plexiglas A bigger and thicker Plexiglas plate is needed to close my vacuum chamber.The current plate is to thin and it bends dangerously strong when the chamber is in use.Due to the deformation the chamber leaks air and I'm not able to maintain a good vacuum.Materials The rest of the money is for the ingredients: High quality, non-poisoning and healthy silicon. It's expensive and I need a lot of it.Just as resin, mixing cups, clay, gloves, and many other things.


The most expensive part is the pump: ~300€ (~380 $) The Plexiglas plate costs about: ~160€ (~203 $) Silicon 40€/kg (~50$/2lb) My Goal: Funding’s about 1000$


However these are my backup plans if I don't reach the final goal.Less than 400$>You all get your money back. Over 400$>Slow start.

I was always losing a lot of picks when playing at scout camps, on
music festivals and when I was just hanging out or jamming with my friends. I spent
a lot of money buying new ones and of course they did not last long as I
managed to lose them all. That is when I got the idea for the WristPick.

Losing picks will no longer be a problem since the pick is attached to the wristband, specially designed to not to interfere with playing.

Handcrafted from premium natural leather with amazing color shades makes

Furthermore, I can customize it to match your wrist circumference.

simplifies the parliament to empower YOU!
SansadBhavan.com enables democracy 2.0 
We simplify information from our country's parliament to engage a common man. 
We pledge to make the Sansad:

simple
accessible
intuitive
fast.
We will make it simple by taking politics - which is, by and large, inaccessible - and making it understandable. Using the correct language, we'll break down complex party policies into accessible and understandable information. 
We will make it accessible by building it as a responsive web application that encourages 'pick up and play' nature. Although we're targeting this at a younger demographic, anybody can use it. There will be hints and 'help' throughout enabling you to feel confident at all times.
We will make it intuitive by creating it in a way that young people are used to with the help of influencers from social networking sites and the 'pinch and swipe' culture that's now the norm for young people when interacting online.
We will make it fast as, in today's world - with all the options available to us, it needs to be. Our target audience expect this, and we'll deliver it.
         


We organize what is happening inside the parliament to keep you informed and involved.
Our goal is to help you make informed decisions, and to that affect, we are a politically impartial, data-driven organization.


Do you know what your neta is up to?

 
Inside the Parliament are some of the best brains in the country. Believe it or not!
But as a common man, could you name the last piece of legislation that your representative voted on? Did they vote for or against that bill? The truth is none of us have the time we need to keep track of what our representatives are doing. 

Sansad Bhavan will change that! We make that hard data easy to digest and follow! Like these draft samples of 'Neta Cards'. Imagine your ""trump cards"" for MPs!



We're creating a
better way. 
Let's help our MPs run our country. 
They are becoming savvier and want to connect with junta and
hear you out. Help create better decisions based on better information and your
participation.




A for Answers
Know how active are each Ministry with list of answers given and pending questions
B for Bills
Identify all the Bills at what stage they are and participate in informed discussion
C for Causes
Discuss matters that your leaders champion and contribute to your own abilities
D for Debates
Stay informed and entertained with the nuances most relevant to the subjects




Sansad Bhavan allows this & more but we need your support to carry on! 
We assembled an amazing team who've developed the idea up to the point of it being made. Now we need you!
We know that to build this democracy tool we'll need to raise money. It will cost an estimated $10,000 to kick start this, so if you feel as passionate about this as I do (which is 'very'), then please back and share this campaign.
We are already on our way with three employees and a few volunteers, committed to bring Sansad Bhavan to life.
Your contributions would help us for the production of the site, the analysis of legislations, and building awareness campaigns. Specifically:

Develop platform and cover the maintenance for the next year.
Strengthen our awareness raising campaign with the printing and distribution of Sansad Bhavan leaflets, access to advertising space on websites (banners), the creation of a series of promotional animated videos targeted at younger audiences and the organization of events such as political debates with the active participation of citizens!
Introduce new innovative democracy promoting tools on our platform that significantly enhance its scope and impact, Namely: the ""policy monitoring tool"" which will allow citizens to compare, contrast, have a say and potentially influence official party positions on a set of topical issues
GROW AND DRIVE THIS CHANGE. TO BE ABLE TO CREATE -
