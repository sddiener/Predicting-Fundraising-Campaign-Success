<p>Let me introduce myself, my name is Emric L’huillier better known as  « Sian », my artist name. I’m 20 years old and I’m from France.</p><p></p>
<p>I started my first musical project two years ago under the name of Skynoize. It lasted for about a year, then I decided to make a fresh start on my own, with a new name but also with a very ambitious project.</p><p></p>
<p>I am very passionate about art in general, very open minded and interested in experimenting with new things. I am autodidactic in drawing, digital painting, musical production, piano, drums and singing.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/930598/files/20141014130411-Sian.jpg?1413317051"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p></p>
<p>Sian is a very complex and wide project that has goals to create a story that evolves everyday through new visual and musical creations. Sian takes place in a fairy world and is filled with mysterious adventures.</p><p></p>
<p>The main hero is an elf who comes from another world mysteriously connected to Earth, its name is Sian. Magic appears on earth after the destruction of our society and leads to a spiritual era. Sian and his friend Keyboard Kid find a map that leads them towards dangerous yet thrilling adventures.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><p>You can find the beginning of a story <a href=""ject.com/#!story/c2387"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">HERE</a></p><p><br/></p><p></p><p>
</p><p>Most of the personas of this story are retranscriptions of real people who helped me create this project. Keyboard Kid for instance is an artist that you can find here :<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">  </span><a href=""https://soundcloud.com/keyboardkidmusic"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"" target=""_blank"">Keyboard Kid Soundcloud</a></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>
<p>Each album, EP and track follows the story in a very original manner. </p><p></p>
<p>The final goal of this project is to propose a Japanese animated series of two seasons consisting of twenty five episodes with a duration of fifty minutes each as well as a video game allowing you to roam across the world of Elsia.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p></p><p style=""text-align: center;""></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/929007/files/20141014011503-rond_couleur.jpg?1413274503"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h2 style=""text-align: center;""><b>MUSIC</b></h2><p style=""text-align: center;""><b></b></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/929008/files/20141014011533-rond_couleur.jpg?1413274533"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><br/></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>
<p>Sian already released a full length album and an EP. The album is free so that you can discover this adventure and its extremely rich and diverse music.</p><p></p>
<p>I personally have a lot of fun exploring, experimenting and mixing different styles of electronic music. Still, I am greatly influenced by style that I appreciate such as j-pop, k-culture and EDM. I also use « chiptune » sonorities because my first ideas came from some of my childhood video games.</p><p>
</p><p>Here are the links to discover the album as well as the EP :</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/928215/files/20141013181357-Sans_titre-1.jpg?1413249237"" src="""" style=""""/></p>                                <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/siancloud/sets/beginning-of-a-story-album"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">BOAS Album</a>                    -                          <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/siancloud/sets/elsia-ep-sian-rhodz"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Elsia EP</a><br/><p><br/></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>
<p>Both, the album and the EP, have been produced this year. I am myself someone who produces extremely fast, regularly releasing rich and complex content.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>
<p>This year will also see the release of my second Sian album, named Gravitalia.

<p>Unfortunately, Sian needs your help in order to continue the adventure.</p><p></p>
<p>A year ago I enrolled in a sound engineering school in order to improve my work as well as my musical production techniques. The school tuition was 10,000 Euros for one year. I had no other choice but to take a student loan in order to enroll in the program.</p><p></p>
<p>Throughout this formation, I had a lot of personal problems which caused me to miss a few days of school. The school did not allow me to take the final exam due to my absences. The production of my first album was almost done and I had a 4-year contract with a music label between my hands which would have assured me a regular income. </p><p></p>
<p>In order to honor this contract I had to produce  two albums and one EP before the end of the year. The only way I could think of to meet the requirements of this contract was to quit the school I was in, which in the end was useless.</p><p></p>
<p>A few days later, I heard the « good news» that my contract was cancelled for a reason that still remains very fuzzy ; thus, I found myself dropped out of a 10,000 Euros program, no contract and a loan of 10,000 Euros to give back.</p><p></p>
<p>The reimbursement of the loan will start January 2015 and I still haven’t found anywhere to perform in shows or any sort of income.</p><p></p>
<p>Right now, I have two choices :</p><p>- Stop the Sian project and look for a job. </p><p></p><p></p>
<p>(a job on top of the Sian project would not be possible due to the Sian project being very time consuming)</p><p></p>
<p>-Ask you for donations in order to pay back my loan and keep the Sian project going.</p><p></p>

Hi everyone !
Let me introduce myself, my name is Emric L’huillier better known as  « Sian », my artist name. I’m 20 years old and I’m from France.
I started my first musical project two years ago under the name of Skynoize. It lasted for about a year, then I decided to make a fresh start on my own, with a new name but also with a very ambitious project.
I am very passionate about art in general, very open minded and interested in experimenting with new things. I am autodidactic in drawing, digital painting, musical production, piano, drums and singing.
Sian is a very complex and wide project that has goals to create a story that evolves everyday through new visual and musical creations. Sian takes place in a fairy world and is filled with mysterious adventures.
The main hero is an elf who comes from another world mysteriously connected to Earth, its name is Sian. Magic appears on earth after the destruction of our society and leads to a spiritual era. Sian and his friend Keyboard Kid find a map that leads them towards dangerous yet thrilling adventures.You can find the beginning of a story HERE
Most of the personas of this story are retranscriptions of real people who helped me create this project. Keyboard Kid for instance is an artist that you can find here :  Keyboard Kid Soundcloud
Each album, EP and track follows the story in a very original manner. 
The final goal of this project is to propose a Japanese animated series of two seasons consisting of twenty five episodes with a duration of fifty minutes each as well as a video game allowing you to roam across the world of Elsia.MUSIC
Sian already released a full length album and an EP. The album is free so that you can discover this adventure and its extremely rich and diverse music.
I personally have a lot of fun exploring, experimenting and mixing different styles of electronic music. Still, I am greatly influenced by style that I appreciate such as j-pop, k-culture and EDM. I also use « chiptune » sonorities because my first ideas came from some of my childhood video games.
Here are the links to discover the album as well as the EP :                                BOAS Album                    -                          Elsia EP
Both, the album and the EP, have been produced this year. I am myself someone who produces extremely fast, regularly releasing rich and complex content.
This year will also see the release of my second Sian album, named Gravitalia. I invite you to discover a little taste of this upcoming album down below-PS : this is work still in progress-VISUAL
Visually, I started creating the design of my characters from the story in order to give it more depth and perspective.  In the year 2015 there will be a technical and graphic sheet of each persona available on LIENWEBSITE. There will be approximately fifty different characters throughout the entire story.
Here are the first two designs I made as well as the wallpaper of my recent EP Elsia in which you can already find four important characters of the story.
I am also creating the cover of my second album which will reveal three new characters as well as Sian's definitive costume. Here are some basic drawings I’ve been working on :
I also started to design the map of the Elsia world which will be available in 2015 on my WEBSITE, with about twenty other artworks (digital paintings). Here is a little preview :
Sian is extremely important to me, it allows me to channel of my creativity and to create the whole world I’ve been imagining throughout my entire childhood.

WHY DID I CREATE THIS FUNDING PROJECT ?

Unfortunately, Sian needs your help in order to continue the adventure.
A year ago I enrolled in a sound engineering school in order to improve my work as well as my musical production techniques. The school tuition was 10,000 Euros for one year. I had no other choice but to take a student loan in order to enroll in the program.
Throughout this formation, I had a lot of personal problems which caused me to miss a few days of school. The school did not allow me to take the final exam due to my absences. The production of my first album was almost done and I had a 4-year contract with a music label between my hands which would have assured me a regular income. 
In order to honor this contract I had to produce  two albums and one EP before the end of the year. The only way I could think of to meet the requirements of this contract was to quit the school I was in, which in the end was useless.
A few days later, I heard the « good news» that my contract was cancelled for a reason that still remains very fuzzy ; thus, I found myself dropped out of a 10,000 Euros program, no contract and a loan of 10,000 Euros to give back.
The reimbursement of the loan will start January 2015 and I still haven’t found anywhere to perform in shows or any sort of income.
Right now, I have two choices :- Stop the Sian project and look for a job. 
(a job on top of the Sian project would not be possible due to the Sian project being very time consuming)
-Ask you for donations in order to pay back my loan and keep the Sian project going.
This funding project will allow me to buy some professional equipment necessary for any type of electronic music creation. It would also help me improve the quality of my tracks, thus have more opportunities to get a contract with a label.Equipment includes:- 2x Yamaha HS 8 ( Enceinte de monitoring) - 550 €- 1x Nektar Panorama P6 - 425 €- 1x Native Instrument - Razor VST 99 €WHY DID I CHOOSE THE FLEXIBLE FINANCING ?
The amount indicated is the amount needed to pay back the entirety of the loan. Even if I do not achieve that goal, the money I do receive will be used to buy myself the equipment and pay back a part of my loan, buying myself time to find ways to make money through performances and get signed to a label.
Time is running out and my ambition is quite big but I am sure that with your support, I will be able to overcome this situation.
If we achieve the total amount, the second album and EP will be free and available to download as a thank you for your support. I will keep you updated via my Facebook page and my website.

<h1><b>THE STORY</b></h1>
<p>In the town of Freakville lies a dark secret. Always caught in the middle of the chaos is Tim and Ed. Tim being the easily frightened, reluctant one, always dragged in by Ed, a brave soul whom always needs to get to the bottom of things. Ranging from the un-dead to the mythical, there's always something stirring up trouble for the two.  In this episode entitled ""The Witch Dog"" The boys are dared by Ed's older brother Vince to visit the abandoned house down the street said to be haunted by the demon spirit of a witch transformed into a giant ravenous dog. Will they chicken out or become legends in the neighborhood? Your donation can help decide their fate.</p>

<p>Hello, my name is Jay CEO of the SupaFi64 Network and we are here to make artists dreams come true! We started a few years ago as just a Live online show talking about Nerd News. Now we have multiple shows under one roof talking about nerd and music topics but also promoting indy artists of all kind: Video Game Developers, Authors, Music Artists, Comic Book Creators, Drawing and Digital Artists as well, and everything in between! </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Imagine having a place in the world where if you create your artistic dream and want to get it out to the public all you have to do is contact us and come on our show. Thats what we are aiming for and thats what we can achieve with your help!</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>We would like to raise enough money to have a BOOTH at Awesome Con this year so we can get the word out that we are here to promote artists of all kind and their work!</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1384579/files/20150415015936-AC_2015_LOGO_DC_DARK.jpg?1429088376"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>By helping us get to Awesome Con you are ensuring that indy, creative and original art makes its way to the forefront of entertainment. This is the start of making sure that we become a society that promotes following your dreams! Who knows? By helping us now, maybe one day we will be promoting YOUR DREAM! </p>
<p></p>
</div><div>
<h3><i>Are We There Yet?</i></h3> <p></p>
<p>The grand total of the amount we need is: $4,800</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Did YOU know a booth at Awesome Con costs $1,000? Well I sure didn’t which is why the first thing we will be doing after reaching $1,000 is securing a booth so that you can see our beautiful face while we are there! On top of that I would like to get the full promotional package that Awesome Con offers us which will gives us a 10x10 Corner booth, 4 exhibitor badges, one 1/2 page color ad in the show program, one full length company sign, and we can give them 15,000 postcard inserts for all of Awesome Con’s swag bags. All together this full package will cost us $1,700. If you guys are going to help to get us here then we are going the make sure the ENTIRE CON knows we’re there!</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>We will be using the next $800 for our own promotional material to put up around our booth which include: A banner with our name on it, Posters to promote us being there, Flyers and handouts for you guys to take with you when you see us there, business cards for you to take with you if you want to get involved with the show, and a Bose speaker system so that you can hear us and our Music Artists that we promote when you come to our booth. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Unfortunately the wonderful package that Awesome con gives does NOT include electricity or wifi and we will have to pay for someone to come out and hook that up ourselves. We are devoting $500 to making sure all of our equipment doesn’t run out of juice for you guys, so the last person that comes up to our booth gets the SAME experience as the first!</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>We will be creating our OWN SWAG just for you guys! part of our giveaway during this fundraiser will be everyone getting a chance to have their own T-SHIRT and tons of other crazy mystery prizes with the SupaFi64 name and Logo printed across! We will be devoting $800 to making sure this happens. AND to make sure you get the biggest and baddest SWAG any company has ever given away! </p>
<p>Like a T-shirt with this Swag-tastic Power Ranger Logo on it: </p>

<p></p>
<p>The remaining $1,000 will be used for hotel stay as some of us are coming a long way to be at the Con. We also will have LOTS of Swag AND Artist materials to give out while we are there, and we want to make sure we don’t leave ANY of that stuff behind, and even if we do, this way we will not have very far to go to get it back! </p>
<p>If we don't get to reach our goal then the money that has already been paid will go to securing the booth and making sure that you see our Beautiful faces at the Con! </p>
<p></p>
</div><div>
<h3><i>Why It Matters</i></h3> <p></p>
<p>We believe that we are the future of what Artist promotion should be and look like. We hope to one day not charge artists at all and get our money elsewhere so that we can fully promote artists without them having to worry about paying us! Until then we will go the extra mile with what they give us to ensure we make as many people interested in their work as possible! </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>If you’ve ever seen the show TRL on MTV then you know what they were able to do for a lot of the music artists in the 90’s. We hope to be the same platform, not just for music but for all forms of artistry. We wish to bridge the language gap as well to show people that art lives on every continent and not just on the one where you speak the same language. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Since our show started a couple of years ago we have received positive feedback from many different people! We were even able to get Eddie Mclintock Star of the television show Warehouse 13 to shout us out in a video:</p>

<p></p>
</div><div> <p></p>
<p>The truth is that not too many people in the world agree with our vision of how we wish to promote artists around the world. Many companies are already spending a lot of their time taking artists money and not giving them what they truly owe them. The only reason people go along with this method is because its something that has been done for years and it has been proven successful in the past. Well we are here to show you theres more then one way to reach your goal. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>As someone who has been driven by the arts since I was in junior high I feel as though allowing an artist to be an artist instead of trying to teach them how to be like others is something we are not known for doing lately. Its difficult for most people to get behind a business like this when they’ve never seen it done like this before. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>We can do this with your help! I plan to create Full Network talking about popular Nerd media and music. We also would like to give up and coming artists of all kind a platform to not only express their opinion of Nerd media but also share who they are and what makes them different then the main stream artists that are out there right now. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The first step is to get the word out that we exist, and we do that by showing up on grand stages like Awesome Con and showing people that indy art is here to stay! We will be spending our entire time telling people about our dream, how they can help, and promoting all of the artists that help us make it there!</p>

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>Hello everyone! My name is Tomasz Jedruszek aka Morano and I am freelance artist since almost 

10 years. For two years I am working with Wizards of the coast creating art to their famous card game Magic the 

Gathering. Since the begining I have been receiving lots of  response from MTG fans intersted in buying prints and 

posters versions of the card artwoks I made. Unfortunatelly I had only two opitons ,print them individually agree to 

poor digital print quality and rising cost per piece to level unacceptable by fans or to print larger amount of posters 

at once which will be excellent offset print quality but  requires me to put some money out of my pocket at start 

without guarantee they will sell all. I do not have to tell You I do not have such extra money can be risk, especially 

as a husband and a father I have to keep my family budget first then think about my fans. Fortunatelly here comes 

Indiegogo with help. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>For years I 've been developing myown projects 

and ideas but because of lack of starting founds I had to keep them in a locker. Now it  a great chance to me to 

bring them out to the world. Before do that however I would like to try something smaller and Prints Shop seems to be 

right choice. Lets see how much will You apreciate my artworks and how indiegogo works then I do promise to bring the 

cool stuff much  more . If we fail to meet the goal money ,well that will be  a lesson to me  and an 

experience but I believe with Your help ,especially counting on Your commnets/advices here, I will have enough time till 

the deadline to convince You the project is worth to contribute.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; 

What You Get</h3>
<br/>As I said when talking about posters there is really only one option: to print them in huge amount, 

once to minimalize costs per piece, twice to get the best quality and offset printing is right there. I need 5000$ to 

cover the basic print of 5 posters. Why 5 ,well this is the starting point and I wanted You to have at least some of 

choice if You think that is too much anyways the entire collection of my works made for MTG reaches 50 pieces. So print 

costs are about 58% the exact number is hard to determinate because all will be paid in polish currency so the final 

amount is basicly what current USD/PLN rate is. Another 38% are shipping+packaging costs and they also needs to be 

secured in front mostly because of cartoon tubes for packaging I have to order them in large amount to cut the cost per 

piece. The rest are Indiegogo fees. The goal money covers first 200 orders in my MTG store and I am talking only about 

""regular Pack "" all the rest is mostly covered from my pocket or those are free stuff I am receiving a lot as a 

freelance artist from the publisher.I decided to start with 200 pieces because it seems to be the optimal amount, there 

is no point to print 100 pieces as they cost almost the same amount as 200 ,from the other side just 2000 $ more would 

do another 200 packages -but I though 7000$ project will be just too much for my Indiegogo debut. If there will be more 

interest than the goal 5000$ I will be able to prepare more packs for You because printing costs running down with 

pieces printed rising up plus I should be able to expand the Prints Store by more posters and maybe even T-shirts and 

other gifts? I  believe You don't have to be Magic the Gathering fan really to find those posters or other uniqe 

perks offer interesting  so I am really counting on Your support. <br/><br/>DETAILS <br/><br/>There is lots of perks to

My Story
Hello everyone! My name is Tomasz Jedruszek aka Morano and I am freelance artist since almost 

10 years. For two years I am working with Wizards of the coast creating art to their famous card game Magic the 

Gathering. Since the begining I have been receiving lots of  response from MTG fans intersted in buying prints and 

posters versions of the card artwoks I made. Unfortunatelly I had only two opitons ,print them individually agree to 

poor digital print quality and rising cost per piece to level unacceptable by fans or to print larger amount of posters 

at once which will be excellent offset print quality but  requires me to put some money out of my pocket at start 

without guarantee they will sell all. I do not have to tell You I do not have such extra money can be risk, especially 

as a husband and a father I have to keep my family budget first then think about my fans. Fortunatelly here comes 

Indiegogo with help. 


The Impact
For years I 've been developing myown projects 

and ideas but because of lack of starting founds I had to keep them in a locker. Now it  a great chance to me to 

bring them out to the world. Before do that however I would like to try something smaller and Prints Shop seems to be 

right choice. Lets see how much will You apreciate my artworks and how indiegogo works then I do promise to bring the 

cool stuff much  more . If we fail to meet the goal money ,well that will be  a lesson to me  and an 

experience but I believe with Your help ,especially counting on Your commnets/advices here, I will have enough time till 

the deadline to convince You the project is worth to contribute.


What We Need & 

What You Get
As I said when talking about posters there is really only one option: to print them in huge amount, 

once to minimalize costs per piece, twice to get the best quality and offset printing is right there. I need 5000$ to 

cover the basic print of 5 posters. Why 5 ,well this is the starting point and I wanted You to have at least some of 

choice if You think that is too much anyways the entire collection of my works made for MTG reaches 50 pieces. So print 

costs are about 58% the exact number is hard to determinate because all will be paid in polish currency so the final 

amount is basicly what current USD/PLN rate is. Another 38% are shipping+packaging costs and they also needs to be 

secured in front mostly because of cartoon tubes for packaging I have to order them in large amount to cut the cost per 

piece. The rest are Indiegogo fees. The goal money covers first 200 orders in my MTG store and I am talking only about 

""regular Pack "" all the rest is mostly covered from my pocket or those are free stuff I am receiving a lot as a 

freelance artist from the publisher.I decided to start with 200 pieces because it seems to be the optimal amount, there 

is no point to print 100 pieces as they cost almost the same amount as 200 ,from the other side just 2000 $ more would 

do another 200 packages -but I though 7000$ project will be just too much for my Indiegogo debut. If there will be more 

interest than the goal 5000$ I will be able to prepare more packs for You because printing costs running down with 

pieces printed rising up plus I should be able to expand the Prints Store by more posters and maybe even T-shirts and 

other gifts? I  believe You don't have to be Magic the Gathering fan really to find those posters or other uniqe 

perks offer interesting  so I am really counting on Your support. DETAILS There is lots of perks to 

choose

downloadable desktop wallpapers version , digitaly signed.

Our zeppelins are light and maneuverable, and unlike radio-controlled airplanes or helicopters they are inherently stable -- if you let go of the controls they’ll just float calmly in mid-air, and they even bounce off obstacles instead of crashing to the ground. To make the controls immediately familiar and accessible to a wide audience, we’ve chosen to use off-the-shelf Xbox controllers.

<p><b>Airframes and Gas Envelopes: </b>Each blimp is constructed on a three-foot-long airframe on which the brain, the motors, and all of the other machinery are mounted.

<p><b>Radio control: </b>The brain of each blimp is a tiny bluetooth-enabled Arduino that communicates with our central station, which is hooked up to the pilot’s controllers and the monitoring panel that we use to keep track of the blimps.</p>
<p><b>Ignition system: </b>Finally, each blimp is tipped with an ignition system that uses an array of needles to tear the gas envelope open, and a small nichrome wire coil (the same metal that glows red hot in your toaster) to ignite the escaping hydrogen.</p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1437393783/tkjcmbofzqvzfacrtxmw.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><div style=""text-align: center;""><i style=""font-size: 90%;"">Anatomy of a Battle Blimp</i></div><br/>
<p><b>The False Profit Aerodrome: </b>Each ultralight Battle Blimp weighs around 23 grams.

<h1>Where will your contribution go?</h1>
<p>Your financial contribution will go entirely towards the cost of creating the Battle Blimps project and bringing it to Burning Man.

First, transportation will cost about $1,500. Contributor perks come in at about another $500. That brings us to $12,300, but we’ve run enough <a href=""http://priceless.false-profit.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">big-budget projects </a>to know that no matter how carefully you budget, you’re almost surely forgetting something, so it’s our practice to add about 6% for emergencies, which is another $700. Last but not least, Indiegogo’s cut is about $1,100, which brings us to $14,100.</p><br/>

<li><p>Scaling up balloon production: We need to produce a lot of safely-combustible bioplastic gas envelopes. Several hundred, maybe a thousand or more.

<li><p>Ignition Problems: We know our ignition system works, but it doesn’t yet work as reliably as we want. This isn’t a show-stopper, but it might be a little irritating if a direct hit on another blimp doesn’t result in a well-deserved fiery demise.</p></li>
<li><p>Fire Inspection: We have submitted a fire safety application and are in contact with the Burning Fire Art Safety Team, and so far we’ve received positive feedback, but it’s always possible that the fire component of this project will not be approved. </p></li>
<li><p>The False Profit Aerodrome: This is the biggest set of all-or-nothing capital investments. We have to wait to see how this campaign is going before we procure the dome and aerodrome equipment. With less than a month before Burning Man, the risk is that we won’t be able to buy a dome and produce the other bits of the Aerodrome in the time available to us (despite having a few dome vendors lined up).</p></li>
<li><p>Burning Man: Burning Man eats art projects. It just does. Things that work flawlessly off the playa mysteriously give up the ghost once they land in the desert. Radios work less well than expected, heat/cold/dust causes electronics to fail, hippies cause project teams to fall into despair… anything can happen out there. </p></li>

<h3>Mon projet</h3>
<p>Bonjour, je m'appelle Lilou et j'ai 15ans.</p>
<p>Je rêve de pouvoir faire des photos de part le monde et en général.</p>
<p>Il y a un an j'ai fait un stage de photographie chez un photographe à Lyon lors de mon stage de 3ème;<br/></p>
<p>Et cette année j'ai l'opportunité de rejoindre ma cousine en Australie à Melbourne pendant 1 mois et demi en mai prochain, en y allant je pourrai faire de mon rêve une réalité... <br/></p>
<p>De plus si je peux y aller je prendrai des cours d'anglais pour pouvoir me débrouiller seule si je voyage encore. Et je suivrai mes cours par correspondance.<br/></p>
<p>Le problème est qu'il faut prendre un billet d'avion... Je ne suis pas encore majeure donc je ne peux pas encore être embauchée et travailler pour quelqu'un... Je gagne déjà un peu d'argent en faisant du miel de pissenlit ou en donnant des cours d'anglais pour mon père mais ça ne suffit malheureusement pas...<br/></p>
<br/>
</div><div>
<h3>Mon budget</h3>
<br/><ul>

Bonjour, je m'appelle Lilou et j'ai 15ans.
Je rêve de pouvoir faire des photos de part le monde et en général.
Il y a un an j'ai fait un stage de photographie chez un photographe à Lyon lors de mon stage de 3ème;
Et cette année j'ai l'opportunité de rejoindre ma cousine en Australie à Melbourne pendant 1 mois et demi en mai prochain, en y allant je pourrai faire de mon rêve une réalité... 
De plus si je peux y aller je prendrai des cours d'anglais pour pouvoir me débrouiller seule si je voyage encore. Et je suivrai mes cours par correspondance.
Le problème est qu'il faut prendre un billet d'avion... Je ne suis pas encore majeure donc je ne peux pas encore être embauchée et travailler pour quelqu'un... Je gagne déjà un peu d'argent en faisant du miel de pissenlit ou en donnant des cours d'anglais pour mon père mais ça ne suffit malheureusement pas...


Mon budget

1 billet d'avion aller-retour coûte environ 1200 €

 cours d'anglais pour 1 mois et demi coutent environ 500 €

les frais sur place seront assurés par mes parents et ma cousine

Ce qui fait un total d'environ 1700€ 

Suite à ce voyage
Je serai presque bi-lingue, ce qui me semble vraiment important pour mon avenir car vivant dans une station de ski parler deux langues est un vrai atout ! Je saurai me débrouiller de façon quasiment autonome; ce qui me permettra de pouvoir faire le programme ERASMUS quand je serai plus grande et ainsi de réaliser un autre voyage dans cette même idée.

project, <i>likeness of disposition</i>, includes the taking of one
Polaroid image per day and recording mundane information about the activities
of the day with some notes about mood and physical feelings. (read more about
the details of project here: <a href=""http://www.alicevinson.com/#!current-work/c17hg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">likeness

<p>The project began last
year, on Dec. 30th, 2014. It is an attempt to see if there is a correlation
between one’s emotional and physical state and a random photograph recorded on
a daily basis. In other words, is it possible that the tools and materials
themselves are somehow able to reflect the mental and physical state that one
might be in at the time one takes a photograph?</p>

meaning and potential, however, having recently finished graduate school, funds
are short. In order to complete a 365-day investigation of interior reality accompanied
by an exterior recording on polaroid film, I need your help to purchase
supplies.</p>

<h3><b>More Detailed Information About My Project</b></h3>
<p>The Process:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only one
     photograph is taken per day.</li>
<li>I randomly select
     one of six different Polaroid cameras. The cameras contain either black
     and white or color film, but I am never certain which camera contains what
     type of film. </li>
<li>The photograph is
     taken at a random time. I take a photograph as quickly as possible, trying
     to not think about subject matter or composition. </li>
<li>Once the
     photograph is taken I document the date, time, how I am feeling
     physically, how I am feeling mentally, general weather conditions, the
     camera used and any problems or malfunctions that may occur. I do this within
     the time it takes for the Polaroid image to develop. </li>
<li>The photograph is
     scanned and posted to the project blog, a.k.a. the virtual gallery, with
     no data given. I want viewers to comment on the image, reflecting what
     they think it represents on a physical and emotional level.</li>

</div></div>","Hi, my
name is Alice Vinson I am an artist and art professor. I have been creating and
exhibiting mixed media artists books for twelve
years, and installation and multimedia works for the past two. My work has been published in 500 Handmade Books Volumes I & II and is held in The University of Arizona Library Special Collection and The University of Arizona Poetry Center Permanent Collection. 



My current
project, likeness of disposition, includes the taking of one
Polaroid image per day and recording mundane information about the activities
of the day with some notes about mood and physical feelings. (read more about
the details of project here: likeness
of disposition). The work is updated daily in an online virtual
journal, a public exhibition of sorts, that anyone can view and
participate in.

06.09.15




physical state: tired
mental state: content, sense of accomplishment
camera: SX-70 (folding)
image: rubber boots
time: 11:50 p.m.
weather: warm, clear


The project began last
year, on Dec. 30th, 2014. It is an attempt to see if there is a correlation
between one’s emotional and physical state and a random photograph recorded on
a daily basis. In other words, is it possible that the tools and materials
themselves are somehow able to reflect the mental and physical state that one
might be in at the time one takes a photograph?




Three months after beginning likeness of disposition, I
created a small book, which I offered for sale through my website.



 
likeness of disposition: 12.30.14 thru 01.17.15

I would like to create a year-long daily record for this project. I plan on exhibiting the final book along with a large hanging piece of the images quilted together between layers of clear vinyl. The images have evolved into a beautiful journal with layered
meaning and potential, however, having recently finished graduate school, funds
are short. In order to complete a 365-day investigation of interior reality accompanied
by an exterior recording on polaroid film, I need your help to purchase
supplies.

What I Need
$1,300.00 is what is needed in order to finish out the year.
Budget

365
     pieces of Polaroid instant film - $1150
6
     yards clear vinyl material for public exhibit piece - $60
Supplies
     for hanging piece and storage - $200
Photo
     paper and inks for digital prints - $400
2
     self published hardcover books (approx. 380 pgs. each) - $300

Some Of The Perks
Below you will find photographs of some of the perks offered. My art pieces have been shown in venues throughout the US and abroad including The University of Arizona Museum of Art, Arizona State University as well as locations in New York and the United Kingdom. Perks include archival prints, and several of my artists books. I am also offering hand made mixed media postcards and blank books too.

<p>I was born and raised in Port-au-Prince Haiti. I am a licensed Social Worker in the District of Columbia and Maryland. I graduated from Howard University in DC with a Master’s Degree in Social Work. also, have a Master Degree in International Services from American University in Washington DC.</p>
<p>I have over 25 years of experience in a variety of Social Work settings and diverse clients such as schools, adoption/foster care, medical, behavior crisis intervention and geriatric. I also volunteer my time and experience by providing emotional support services as needed to the Haitian community of the Washington DC and Maryland area.</p>
<p> Three of my great passions in life are travel, birds photography and collecting Haiti vintage postcards. I believe that my postcards collection has made me better appreciate my native country and culture as well as that of the people I’ve met through traveling.</p>
<p>My campaign is to raise $4,000 dollars for framing and reproducing the postcards for a small exhibition. The Exhibition is scheduled for May 2018 to celebrate Haitian Heritage.  May 18th is all about celebrating the culture and heritage of the Haitian flag, which is emblazoned with the country’s coat of arms and the colors red and blue, adopted from the French flag. Haiti gained its independence from France in 1804, making the first Black country in the world.</p>
<p>The name of the Exhibit is <strong>Haiti A History in Postcards.</strong>  Your contribution will greatly help me achieve my goal.  My vision is to take visitors on a visual journey through Haiti as it illustrates postcards as early 1900's. Other Haitians took to social media to share pictures of  Haiti's beautiful beaches to make a point about the President's alleged remarks.

I graduated from Howard University in DC with a Master’s Degree in Social Work. also, have a Master Degree in International Services from American University in Washington DC.
I have over 25 years of experience in a variety of Social Work settings and diverse clients such as schools, adoption/foster care, medical, behavior crisis intervention and geriatric. I also volunteer my time and experience by providing emotional support services as needed to the Haitian community of the Washington DC and Maryland area.
 Three of my great passions in life are travel, birds photography and collecting Haiti vintage postcards. I believe that my postcards collection has made me better appreciate my native country and culture as well as that of the people I’ve met through traveling.
My campaign is to raise $4,000 dollars for framing and reproducing the postcards for a small exhibition. The Exhibition is scheduled for May 2018 to celebrate Haitian Heritage.  May 18th is all about celebrating the culture and heritage of the Haitian flag, which is emblazoned with the country’s coat of arms and the colors red and blue, adopted from the French flag. Haiti gained its independence from France in 1804, making the first Black country in the world.
The name of the Exhibit is Haiti A History in Postcards.  Your contribution will greatly help me achieve my goal.  My vision is to take visitors on a visual journey through Haiti as it illustrates postcards as early 1900's. Other Haitians took to social media to share pictures of  Haiti's beautiful beaches to make a point about the President's alleged remarks. I decided to do a  postcard exhibition to highlight a positive view of Haitian culture, lifestyle, and history.

<p><u><i><strong>Introduction:</strong></i></u></p>
<p>Silwan is considered one of the most crowded towns in Palestine, where more than 60,000 people live in it. The neighborhood of Silwan is located in the southern part of the Old City of Jerusalem. It is considered one of the most marginalized and alienated areas in Palestine, facing constant threats and attacks directed by the Israeli government and settlers. Such threats include: arrests of children, youth, and women as well as seizure of buildings by Israeli settlers, demolition of houses and forced evacuation.</p>
<p>We believe that such threats and attacks attempt to displace original citizens and evacuate the area from its Palestinian residents who own the land, particularly due to the Israeli government and settlers’ claim that Silwan area is the capital of The Kingdom of David, hence they claim their right to control the land.</p>
<p>In fact, the suffering of Silwan and Jerusalem areas is tremendous; they live under continuous risks of losing their homes. “Palestinians are rarely able to obtain building permits; Israeli authorities approve less than two percent of requests.

<p>By supporting LIVING AWAY / A WAY OF LEAVING you will have the opportunity to contribute to the visibility of migrant Cuban artists in NYC with unique but often marginalized artistic languages.</p>
<p>We strongly believe that there is a need for more alternative and inclusive art projects in NYC, especially those that empower the voices of migrants, as LIVING AWAY / A WAY OF LEAVING intends to do. We believe that in the current circumstances this project should not only be possible but necessary.</p>
<p>We are an experienced team that has developed various initiatives to support emerging independent artist. We always believed in collaborative networks as the base for developing platforms as such. With the support of these bases we were able to nurture a vibrant movement of performing artist in Cuba and internationally.</p>
<p>We launched this campaign with the goal of achieving a basic budget that will make possible this unique event in New York City. With your contribution you will be helping towards the development of a community of migrant artist and have a strong impact in the cultural landscape of the city.</p>
<p>All the participant artists will generously present their work without monetary compensation. But we still need a basic budget to cover technical, travel and production expenses. YOUR CONTRIBUTION WILL BE ESSENTIAL FOR MAKING THIS DREAM COME TRUE!</p>
<p>All contributors will get access to the full program of performances and our infinite gratitude. . For larger contributions you will be included as sponsor, a special package of the printed material and other items listed in our perks.</p>

<p>With LIVING AWAY / A WAY OF LEAVING we want to tackle the difficulty of creating alternative performing arts projects in the city of New York. While being such a multicultural metropolis, the creation of more spaces that allow dialogue among other cultures is still necessary.</p>
<p>We believe not only that we will be able to attract the attention of a wide audience with our strong and diverse performance program, but also that we will situate a community of unique artists on NYC's map.</p>

<p>WHY WE NEED YOUR SUPPORT:</p>
<p>Hi! I am Semra Sevin, my background is in fashion &amp; art photography and I am the initiator and curator behind the exhibition “Passengers of a Kaleidoscopic Journey”.  I need to raise 5,000 euros to cover the costs and would love your support.  I need to find funding for transportation costs of work from both Istanbul and LA, insurance, technical support, lighting, payment for the exhibition space.  Every penny you kindly donate will take us one step closer to realizing our goal.  </p>
<p>To keep costs low and within a tight budget, I am relying on the support of volunteers and so your funds will go directly to the cost of installing the exhibition.  </p>
<p>To attract as many members of the public as possible the exhibition is free of charge.  In addition, to maximise the exhibition’s exposure it coincides with the makers of ""The Haus"" <a href=""http://www.thehaus.de/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.thehaus.de/</a> .</p>
<p>WHY I BELIEVE THE THEME OF IDENTITY IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE TO DISCUSS:</p>
<p>We all face challenges in regards to our identity.  From my own firsthand experience, as a daughter of immigrants who moved to Germany, I know how others have perceived me to fit their ideas of a cultural norm.  My perceived (!) identity has fluctuated from German to Turkish, from a fundamentalist to a parasite.  When I read or watch media reports about either mass migration due to war or economic deprivation or about individual discrimination due to gender or race, I feel we are still only at the start of the debate on identity.  </p>
<p>Last year, I received a public commission to photograph and interview immigrant’s children between LA and Berlin.  It exposed me to how increasingly cosmopolitan the world is becoming but, perhaps not always diverse, and I mean diversity in the acceptance of culture, race and gender.  My own interpretation of identity through my photography is to explore variety and to celebrate it. </p>
<p>By collaborating with my fellow artists, I hope the exhibition will inspire people to bring cultures together, to accept others for who they are and to create a positive network between artists from different backgrounds. Through our passion for art, I believe we can start the debate on questioning concepts of identity as well as challenging prejudices. </p>
<p>If you agree, put on your sponsoring outfit to support Passengers of a Kaleidoscopic Journey!  I look forward to your support. </p>

I started handpoke tattooing 2 years ago and since then, I have received a lot of feedback from the people I've tattooed on how safe and seen they feel with me, and how they appreciate my bringing heart and soul into the process.</p><p>Here’s what one of my tattooees, Uma, says about me:</p><p><i>Sofia is the most gentle, powerful and sweet tattoo artist. She meets you with such warmth, understanding and professionalism. It is impossible to not feel safe and understood when she is tattooing you. She is not only a great artist, she also brings magic in to her work and the whole experience becomes something bigger than “just” a tattoo, where something profoundly soul connected can take place.</i></p><p>The reason why I want to open my own studio is that I have never felt at home in ""regular"" tattoo studios in cities and the atmosphere that I have felt there. I want to do Soul work, making body art that is a visual reminder of one's inner truth.</p><p>So in order to continue on this art/soul/heart path, I am creating my own tattoo studio where I get to set the tone! And I'm building it in nature. In a tipi. This one:</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1555258094/cdat1iklqnnntywk45hv.png"" src=""""/></p><h3> </h3><h3>The studio</h3><p>I lived in this tipi last summer. It's an amazing space, 20' wide (6 meters) with a very light and calm atmosphere on the inside. One can feel the elements in there – the wind, the earth and the raindrops drumming on the canvas.</p><p>And why a tattoo studio in a tipi? Because it goes hand in hand with the way that I tattoo, by hand, in reverence of life and nature. And because I have the perfect spot for it; a place where people come to celebrate heart and spirit – the course center of Ängsbacka in Sweden. </p><p>Creating a tattoo studio out of a tipi means turning an already magical and beautiful space into also being a functional and hygienic space. It means to build a proper floor, getting running hot water, buying furniture, sewing new inner walls, making it rain drop safe, paying for permits … and much more. (See below for more details about where the money will go.)</p><p>Pachamama Handpoke Tattoo (that's the name) will be open during the Ängsbacka summer festival season, June through August – hopefully for many summers to come! The opening date is June 10th this year.</p><p>If you don't know about Ängsbacka, it is Sweden's biggest course center for spiritual and personal growth, as well as a live-in community. It's awesome. Learn more about it here: <a href=""https://angsbacka.se/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://angsbacka.se/</a></p><p> </p><h3>Why support this project?</h3><p>Because it will be a place for<span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;""> soul, heart, connection and slowness in a fast-paced world, and </span>we need those kind of places<span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">.

The process of making a handpoked tattoo is quieter, less painful and takes longer. I hold the tattoo needle in my hand like a pen, I dip it in ink, and I create the image dot by dot. The needle/ink reaches the same skin depth as in a 'regular' tattoo, but the handpoked tattoo generally never bleeds since the skin gets less traumatized. (It's under less of an attack compared to a tattoo done by machine that might use more needles, and go much faster.) Because it takes longer to create a handpoked tattoo, it works best for making smaller pieces, and is not a good method if you want a big sleeve/leg/entire back, since that would take literally forever. The price for a certain sized handpoked tattoo may be higher than the 'same' tattoo made by machine, and that has to do with the amount of time that it takes to make it. The handpoke method is for someone who would enjoy a quiet, heartfelt tattoo session and a not-so-big tattoo that is like a piece of jewellery.</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1555433073/o7qrgbmk0kma1ibrhf1k.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><h3><strong>MY STORY part I:</strong></h3><h3><strong><i>How I Found Creativity Again</i></strong></h3><p>This crowdfunding campaign is actually a part of my journey of finding creative flow. It started in a basement studio in Malmö in 2015, at a time when I was feeling completely blocked.

I wasn't very interested in tattooing and had never thought about handpoke tattooing before, but I said yes only because I wanted to spend more time with her! Though before I knew it, I’d ordered more material and was practicing on fruits, my toes, my thighs and fellow community members…</p><p>Thanks to the community where I was living, Ängsbacka, and thanks to my travels thereafter, I've had an abundance of people to practice on. Thanks to letting the people who crossed paths with me inspire me with new ideas, my creative inspiration came back. I started combining the collaborative act of tattooing with my interests in plants, animals and shamanism. People would share their stories and dreams with me, and together we would weave images for them.</p><p>Reaching out and asking for your support is a way for me to continue on the path of collaboration.

I started handpoke tattooing 2 years ago and since then, I have received a lot of feedback from the people I've tattooed on how safe and seen they feel with me, and how they appreciate my bringing heart and soul into the process.Here’s what one of my tattooees, Uma, says about me:Sofia is the most gentle, powerful and sweet tattoo artist. She meets you with such warmth, understanding and professionalism. It is impossible to not feel safe and understood when she is tattooing you. She is not only a great artist, she also brings magic in to her work and the whole experience becomes something bigger than “just” a tattoo, where something profoundly soul connected can take place.The reason why I want to open my own studio is that I have never felt at home in ""regular"" tattoo studios in cities and the atmosphere that I have felt there. I want to do Soul work, making body art that is a visual reminder of one's inner truth.So in order to continue on this art/soul/heart path, I am creating my own tattoo studio where I get to set the tone! And I'm building it in nature. In a tipi. This one:  The studioI lived in this tipi last summer. It's an amazing space, 20' wide (6 meters) with a very light and calm atmosphere on the inside. One can feel the elements in there – the wind, the earth and the raindrops drumming on the canvas.And why a tattoo studio in a tipi? Because it goes hand in hand with the way that I tattoo, by hand, in reverence of life and nature. And because I have the perfect spot for it; a place where people come to celebrate heart and spirit – the course center of Ängsbacka in Sweden. Creating a tattoo studio out of a tipi means turning an already magical and beautiful space into also being a functional and hygienic space. It means to build a proper floor, getting running hot water, buying furniture, sewing new inner walls, making it rain drop safe, paying for permits … and much more. (See below for more details about where the money will go.)Pachamama Handpoke Tattoo (that's the name) will be open during the Ängsbacka summer festival season, June through August – hopefully for many summers to come! The opening date is June 10th this year.If you don't know about Ängsbacka, it is Sweden's biggest course center for spiritual and personal growth, as well as a live-in community. It's awesome. Learn more about it here: https://angsbacka.se/ Why support this project?Because it will be a place for soul, heart, connection and slowness in a fast-paced world, and we need those kind of places. I receive so much feedback from other people that confirms this. The studio will be a beautiful and magic oasis that you can come and visit in the summer, going through the ritual of getting a tattoo or not – or you can help create the opportunity for other people to come and do the same.What I need and what you getI need an energy boost from as many people as possible to fuel me in building this space! The energy boost can come in different shapes: showing me your support & your belief in me, sharing this campaign with people that you know, and/or donating money.I'm aiming for €3500 altogether, and within that amount, even the smallest donation counts!

Having made miracles happen to afford the travel and production costs, the last piece of our puzzle is Accomodation and Logistics while we are in New York.

We feel that this work  attempts to fill the widening gap between what we find in the world and the media and what we are really looking for.

We feel that this work  attempts to fill the widening gap between what we find in the world and the media and what we are really looking for. We see the success of this venture as a huge victory for Independent performing Artists, particularly South Africans, and an inspiration to others and ourselves to continue in this way and even take more risks in favour of producing original, compelling and necessary work and stories for audiences within and beyond traditional theatre walls!

Risks & Challenges
We have faced many so far and understand much of the complexity and difficulty of what we are trying to do, however we believe that our success will create advantages that far outweigh those risks and challenges, making every bit of effort worthwhile. We see Songs of Story Men as the beginning of a brand and a journey that has the potential to be as epic and far-reaching as our imaginations are, setting a trend and even creating a storytelling technique of its own - which every contributor will have claim to helping get off the ground!

Other Ways You Can Help
Even if you are unable to contribute money your help will be invaluable in getting the word out and helping us make some noise about our campaign and what we are hoping to achieve in New York with your assistance. 
Don't forget to use the Indiegogo share tools!
Thank You and look forward to sharing the successes of this trip!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2>Global Fiesta is a planned 11' by 64' mural on a wall facing the Stop and Shop parking lot at the Park Town Center complex on Raritan Ave.</h2>
<h3>Celebrate the cultural diversity of Highland Park</h3>
<p>Exploring feelings we share through the common human experience, Global Fiesta highlights the musical nature of human beings. There can never be a party without music, so this mural expresses a universal language by exploring rhythm and movement through color and form. This mural shows all types of people just letting loose, because as people dance, all is forgotten and we unite as one. When people feel what unites us, they forget about differences and embrace similarities.</p>
<h3>Unite through art</h3>
<p>Different figures represent bodies in action and movement, tied together to reflect the common thread that binds humanity. Particular color combinations and ambiguous imagery hint at various different cultures. Rather than represent a dominant language, and alienate those who don't speak that language, the painting speaks to everyone through lines that simply allude to certain scripts. Everyone can read this painting the same way and understand its message.</p>
<h3>Appreciate the significance</h3>
<p>Kids will relate to the vibrant colors and identifiable figures, adults will embrace the deliberate composition and aesthetic qualities, while the artsy intellectuals will appreciate the strong theoretical foundation informed by a semiotic exploration of the universal human experience through the Apollinian and Dionysian duality. This mural will add a great amount of cultural capital to the town.</p>
<h3>Meet the artists</h3>
<p>My name is Jonathan Horowitz, Highland Park based artist and founder of PAZ culture system. You may have seen me covered in paint, putting finishing touches on my downtown murals, maybe you met me at the PAZ culture system organized Winter Art Bazaar, or perhaps I've even tutored your children, or you.</p>
<p>I was raised in Highland Park and I live here now. I want to show what makes Highland Park so great, translating our energy into substantial public art projects. This will be the first of many public art projects and part of the bigger campaign to transform downtown Highland Park as outlined in the Highland Park Redevelopment plan. This comprehensive document emphasizes the importance of public art and explains how it can translate into real economic gains for the town. </p>
<p>I will be hiring and training other local artists so that they will be able to execute murals in the future. Basically, this mural provides a great opportunity to introduce new artists to public art in Highland Park and get them ready to help us show why our town is so great. We want to involve the public in our campaign so everyone can be part of this project.</p>
<h3>Help us make this happen</h3>
<p>The mural should take approximately 3-4 weeks. We will begin in late March or early April and be done in time for the annual Street Fair in May.</p>
<p>We will execute sixteen panels. Each panel should take approximately 20hrs. Each panel is approximately 44 sq/ft and we estimate that each square foot should take at least a half hour. This adds up to around 320hrs.</p>
<ul>
<li>The mural will require three layers of paint. One layer to prime, one base coat, and one final layer.</li>
</ul>

<p class=""_mce_tagged_br"">We will be hiring 2 or 3 local artists and paying them a competitive rate </p>

<p>We are promoting this mural heavily and we will get press coverage. People from other towns will want to come to Highland Park to see what all the buzz is about.

<p><strong>Additional Comments:</strong></p>
<p>This is a preliminary, conceptual sketch. Since most people won’t be seeing this close-up, and parts of the wall are obscured by greenery, detail may be lost, so large, solid, complementary colored shapes are applied to enable easy long distance viewing.The final sketch will have more effective color choices while the movements of the figures will be tighter and more expressive. The design may be simplified slightly in order to accommodate the limited resources available to execute this large endeavor. Also, some of the imagery or symbolism will be slightly adjusted so that the overall message is more cohesive and coherent. </p>

<h2>What is Brave New Voices?</h2>
<p>Every year in July, 50 teams of youth aged 13-19 come from all across the nation and world to participate in the Brave New Voices International Youth Poetry Slam Festival (BNV). During the week-long festival, which is held in a different U.S. city each year, these youth from Brooklyn to L.A., Hawaii to India, share space on and off the stage, forming powerful bonds of friendship and understanding through the expression of their words and art. They also participate in hands-on workshops with some of the world’s most renowned spoken word poets and performing artists.</p>
<p>Beginning in 2008, the Sacrificial Poets has taken a team of the top local youth poets to experience what is truly one of the most transformative experiences available to young writers and performers today. Upon returning home, these youth have gone on to become powerful leaders in our communities, creating poetry clubs, organizing inter-school competitions, hosting events, and even competing at the adult level in the National Poetry Slam as members of Durham’s Bull City Slam Team. In fact, graduates of the Sacrificial Poets youth slam team have performed at the Sundance Film Festival, featured at the Nuyorican Poets Café in Manhattan’s Lower East Side, and become teachers of poetry to youth across the state and nation.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>“Prophecy” is a collaborative effort by Corpus Christi artists Day Wheeler and Jimmy Peña born out of the thought that according to the Mayans, the year 2012 is predicted to be the end of the world. If mankind is still here in January 2013, this show will be a response to the genesis of a new apocalypse, which according to some, we may be witnessing now as our environment shows signs of deterioration and stress. </p>
<p>""Prophecy"" is a visual comment on the slow decline of the ecological balance of the Texas Gulf Coast as a result of petroleum waste products and spillage polluting our waters and lives. This site-specific installation will be executed with recycled materials combined to adapt to and redefine the main gallery at K Space Contemporary (KSC) into an ominous, seductive environment with not only constructions, but also lighting, sound, and kinetic features.</p>
<p>The artists, Day Wheeler and Jimmy Peña, have shared studio space for the past 14 years and have collaborated on many projects. <a href=""http://www.jimmypenaart.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Jimmy Pena</a> is a self-taught artist with an impressive body of work surpassing many academically trained artists both conceptually and technically. Day possesses an MFA and teaches at a community college while continuing her studio work. While coming from different backgrounds, these artists work well together, bringing about collaborations that read as one voice.  </p>
<p>We are requesting funding for the creation, promotion, administrative and logistical support for this art exhibit. Many in our population are visual learners. ""Prophecy"" is a fresh approach for this area in addressing these concerns. With an island of plastic the size of Texas floating in the Pacific, animal injuries, fish kills, and overflowing landfills, man is leaving a negative footprint. This is a message that cries out to be heard. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We need $3,830 to fund this project.  We have already received $1830 from Texas Commission on the Arts (TCA), and seek to raise an additional $2000 with IndieGoGo.  TCA requires 1:1 matching funds, so you will also be helping us match our TCA grant.</p>
<p>The money will be spent as outlined below:</p>
<ul>
<li>$1000 - Artists' Stipend &amp; supply allowance.  Each artist will receive $500 towards supplies and time to create and install the exhibition. Artists may use their stipend as they feel best facilitates the creation of the exhibition.   </li>
<li>$1000 - Administrative costs include marketing via press releases to state and local media, KSC website, social media, and design for print materials.city, and gallery attendant. Additional cost free marketing will be achieved through the Corpus Christi Downtown Management District’s ArtWalk newsletter &amp; website (<a href=""http://www.artwalkcc.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.artwalkcc.com/</a>) and its publication DTown Delivers. </li>
<li>$1500 - facility costs (rent/utilities).</li>
<li>$330 - Printing for 500 postcards, 200 brochures &amp; vinyl for the title wall.  </li>
</ul>
<p>Even if we do not reach our goal, the show will go on.  Budgets for Artists' Stipends and adminstrative costs will be cut evenly by a percentage determined by the amount raised.</p>
<p>Please see available funding levels and benefits to the right. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Because ""Prophecy's"" subject matter strikes a sensitive nerve in our area, we expect the exhibition to be well-received by the public and reviewed by our local newspaper, Corpus Christi Caller Times.  </p>
<p>Topics embraced by this installation include oil, water, green art, and ecological issues. Every kind of refuse washes onto the beaches in South Texas. Much comes from offshore oil-rigs, oil tankers passing through, and various other travelers on our waters, or visitors to our beaches. All imagery and construction in this installation will be made of recycled materials, with an emphasis on petroleum-based plastics. </p>
<p>Prophecy's message is that it is time to remove manʼs negative impact on our waters.  We hope to make people aware that the world is facing a new apocalypse. The very balance of the ecological system is in obvious danger and the enemy is the human race. This type of alternative approach will interest a population where contemporary uncensored art is rare.</p>
<p>To enforce the message, KSC has invited the Texas Coastal Bend Chapter of the Surfrider Foundation to present information about the impact of pollution on the ocean and beaches during the opening reception.  </p>
<p>In addition, there will be a comment wall/community art piece where viewers participate by drawing or writing comments on refuse taken from a gathered pile from the beach. They will add their pieces to a viewer-made collage on the front gallery wall. Our goals is for visitors to become more aware of their own ecological footprint and perhaps, alter their garbage disposal behavior accordingly.</p>

<h3>My Story</h3>
<h4>My name is Wanda Pepin and I am an internationally collected fine artist. One day, while meditating I asked myself, ""What could I do to improve the world?"" Since I am an artist, the way I figured I could help was to use my talents by painting bright cheerful paintings with symbols of love and peace for our public spaces. The many colors would bring joy and the symbolism would remind each of us of peace and love. I believe that if we can change the collective mindset of the world to a positive and loving one, then we could indeed have world peace and be filled with love for all. </h4>
<h4>My vision is to donate 100, 10x10 gallery wrap canvas paintings to a community to fill a public space. These paintings will be from my floral series called Floralies. The goal is to continue this project until I have filled public spaces around the world. To determine where the first installation will go I will count pledges and the greatest number of pledges from a community will get these paintings (from my first project here on IndieGoGo) donated to their community. I will keep everyone informed with a graph and posted to this project here on IndieGoGo. <br/>
</h4>
<h4>Timeframe: 2 months from Feb. 24, 2011 from start to finish. Goal for this project will be 100 paintings completed and installed by April 24th. <br/>

<br/><h1><b>Seven phases of metamorphosis And the consciousness Evolution of humanity</b></h1>
<p>If you love art, have acceptance and open heart for ideas related to the spirit, and like To have a real treat limited edition
artworks as perks –This project is for
you. 

</p>
<p>This is an art project based on the “seven planetary seals”
, made by Dr. Rudolf Steiner about a century ago.</p>
<p>The planetary seals are occult symbols, that represents seven stages in the evolution Of human consciousness and planet earth.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/109235/files/20131002134105-the_planetary_seals3.fw.png?1380746465"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p>Among many other issues, Dr. Steiner wrote and lectured
extensively about the Evolution of human consciousness, as it is revealed to
occult vision and as it is Reflected in history, through religious and
scholastic texts, mythology, art, and Specific events and individuals. </p>
<p>The development of mankind, as depicted by Dr. Steiner, is
quite different from the General views on the subject.</p>
<p>It goes far more back and describes the events spiritually,
rather than in terms of Brain size or bones structures. 

</p></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><p>Behind the countless complexities that were, and still are
unfolding through our Development, there is an archetype, spiritual law of
development. This cosmic law Have seven unique stages, each with its own characteristics.  </p>
<p>While in humanity and in each one of us this process is
manifested spiritually, it also Expresses itself  tangibly, through the forms of plants
development.</p>
<p>It will be out of the scope of this introduction to tell
more about this process by words, Since all my effort is to express it, through
art,  believing that art can and should Become the gate in the verge of awakening to a profound and deep aspects of Existence.
Studding the details of this process is complementary
to what I am trying To do by art, and by all means it can provide a much better
understanding of what is Being expressed in the seals and in my interpretations
of it.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, one thing is important to mention about the
present time in relation to The evolution of consciousness: </p>
<p>The modern man and woman are the outcome of a development
that started long, Long ago.</p>
<p>The last accomplishment of this evolution is the  individualization and personal Intelligence,</p>
<p>Outcome of half millennium of complete dominance of
scientific materialistic thinking And Industrial revolution. 


</p></span></span></span><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><p>Perior to this
accomplishment, we had to be left alone, completely loose every trace Of our
ability to feel our connection with the spiritual world.</p>
<p>We are now ready and capable to begin our cosmic breath out, transforming  the Passive receptiveness of the spiritual,
that we had in  ancient times (humanities Breath in), into an activity toward the spirit, reshaping our union with the
spirit in the Light of intelligence and free will. </p>
<p>Now that we all have something to ponder about.. I would
like to introduce the art Itself.<br/></p></span></span></span><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate"">

Seven phases of metamorphosis And the consciousness Evolution of humanity
If you love art, have acceptance and open heart for ideas related to the spirit, and like To have a real treat limited edition
artworks as perks –This project is for
you. 


This is an art project based on the “seven planetary seals”
, made by Dr. Rudolf Steiner about a century ago.
The planetary seals are occult symbols, that represents seven stages in the evolution Of human consciousness and planet earth.

Among many other issues, Dr. Steiner wrote and lectured
extensively about the Evolution of human consciousness, as it is revealed to
occult vision and as it is Reflected in history, through religious and
scholastic texts, mythology, art, and Specific events and individuals. 
The development of mankind, as depicted by Dr. Steiner, is
quite different from the General views on the subject.
It goes far more back and describes the events spiritually,
rather than in terms of Brain size or bones structures. 

Behind the countless complexities that were, and still are
unfolding through our Development, there is an archetype, spiritual law of
development. This cosmic law Have seven unique stages, each with its own characteristics.  
While in humanity and in each one of us this process is
manifested spiritually, it also Expresses itself  tangibly, through the forms of plants
development.
It will be out of the scope of this introduction to tell
more about this process by words, Since all my effort is to express it, through
art,  believing that art can and should Become the gate in the verge of awakening to a profound and deep aspects of Existence.
Studding the details of this process is complementary
to what I am trying To do by art, and by all means it can provide a much better
understanding of what is Being expressed in the seals and in my interpretations
of it.
Nevertheless, one thing is important to mention about the
present time in relation to The evolution of consciousness: 
The modern man and woman are the outcome of a development
that started long, Long ago.
The last accomplishment of this evolution is the  individualization and personal Intelligence,
Outcome of half millennium of complete dominance of
scientific materialistic thinking And Industrial revolution. 


Perior to this
accomplishment, we had to be left alone, completely loose every trace Of our
ability to feel our connection with the spiritual world.
We are now ready and capable to begin our cosmic breath out, transforming  the Passive receptiveness of the spiritual,
that we had in  ancient times (humanities Breath in), into an activity toward the spirit, reshaping our union with the
spirit in the Light of intelligence and free will. 
Now that we all have something to ponder about.. I would
like to introduce the art Itself.
What is unique about this project that makes it different
from anything else in Contemporary art?

Methods of work – except of creating sculptures to the
seals, I have integrated water Circulating in six of them. The water springs
out and drained in specific points in each Sculpture , create a defined pathes
of streaming water along the surface of the Sculptures. I experiment with water
while I’m sculpturing the forms, and this is Apparent in the forms themselves.
Water is actually a participator in creating this Forms.
I also use light and fire in specific places, to indicate
about the nature of certain Motives in the sculptures.
The use of the elements – water, light, fire, is for me a
way to use technology in a Different way than the usual.
Technology is not only flat screens, projectors and robotic
apparatus. When you have The ability the put small water pump in a sculpture,
it is technology too. If I can put Some led lights in a sculptures without
having to worry about water , it is also Technology. I find that exploring and making use of the different qualitiesof the  Elements is important factor in this project, and without
technology it could not have Been done.
Connection between dimensions – it is no secret that there
is a great shift of attention Into the two dimensional realm ( anyone said
smartphone? or ipad?). the exhibition Plan for this project combines  the third 
and second dimensions. (see the pitch video For a illustration). 

Metamorphosis – in this project there will be exhibited
seven sculptures/vessels, that Are connected by means of form. Each form is
connected to the former, and all Together create a meaningful form development, that also indicates and resonate With internal change,as soul qualities.  the viewer is trigged into activeness, to Complete the formative
“gaps” between one sculpture to the next,  This is part of the Nature of
metamorphosis, and it  creates  very different experience than being in the Mind, in the intellect , which is the general experience in contemporary art. Where am i at now?

I have almost finished four of the seventh sculptures planned for this project.This are the prototypes that are in the pitch video.I am generally happy with them,except thatThree of them need to be about 20-30 percent larger. this will allow bigger  volume of Water in the sculptures and the streams will become more vigorous and apparent.It might seem like a lot of work but  actually it is more of a technical task and  not very Time consuming; i already started to create the enlarged prototypes and will post Updates here with pictures as the campaign continue. 
I have a pretty good idea about how the rest of the sculptures will look, though it will Probably go through a lot of  changes . there is a lot of surprises and developments in The way water and light, and eventually also fire, will be integrated into this very Interesting stages,What do i need and how can you help?

The finished prototypes of the sculptures needs to have molds. only than i will be able To produce the first sculptures and apply the specific desired finish for each Sculpture. and , it will become reproducible.
Each mold for this sculptures should cost, in a professional mold house ,between 2500-4000$, depend on the type of mold. 
So molds for all the seven sculptures will cost between 18,000 - 28,000$.
The second thing that i need help for is with budget that will allow me to dedicate Myself to finishing this project. so in this aspect you will fulfill the traditional role of Patrons, that was an important and respected part in the realization of most art in Past times. 
 Perks 


in addition to  the perks that are listed below, all contributors  to this project , will be Listed on the seven metamorphosis site ,  and will be joined to the mailing list, in Which i will publish,as a sequence of related essays,or chapters, a book about all that Is only hinted in  this presentation. this this is not a guaranteed perk, but rather an Attempt that i already started  to work on and i hope that will become reality. it is not Offered as a perk because i would not like to commit myself in this campaign to Anything but the art, but i will surely be encouraged to address this task if i will feel Demand for it.

<h2>Thank you for your interest in the Arts &amp; Soul Project.  </h2>
<p>This is a capital campaign to establish and operate an expressive arts studio in the community for the community. </p>
<p>The Soul(Art)iculation™ Studio is the magical place where men, women and children come to encounter and express their feelings in a tangible way.  It is a sacred space where experiencing the power of art making  transforms the art maker. Studio clients learn to allow their soul’s story to come forth. Via their creative practice, the client sustains and flourishes in increased vitality, wellness and joy.</p>
<p>Artist-Healer Leah Young returned to college at forty-three where she experienced an awakening via her own art making. “My teacher nurtured the spirit of art within me without judgment.  As a result, through my inner art maker,  I reconnected with my creative voice and my soul’s story. ”</p>
<p>Her experience led Leah to synthesize her professional skills as a coach, trainer, reiki master, therapeutic guided imagery facilitator, interfaith minister and sound healer with her newly discovered creative process into a multimodal expressive arts  system known as Soul(Art)iculation™.   More simply, the system is a way to play with sound, imagery, writing, movement, painting,  and drawing, to access and give voice to the client’s deepest feelings for improved quality of life.</p>
<p>The Arts &amp; Soul Project aims to create an open studio environment within which clients can cultivate their soul’s voice through the expressive arts.</p>
<p>The Soul(Art)iculation™ Studio offers a combination of expressive arts healing programs including Young’s own Journaling Your Journey visual journaling program, her Soul’s Story™ Arts Play experience, other non-directive arts process such as drawing, sculpture, collage, mixed-media and guest artist programs.  Services will be offered to participants on a sliding scale.</p>
<p>“The vision is to make art, cultivate our soul’s voice and to be of service doing the work that I love.”</p>
<p>The first studio is slated to open in Las Vegas, Nevada  Fall 2013.  “Eventually, we see the concept changing the face of the global community.  Art lives in every soul.”</p>

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>It took me years to get to where I am. I have overcome several obstacles from broken marriages to losing a great job to starting my dream job. I fought and continued to work long hours to make my dream come true of having my own personal training business. I love helping women transform their lives by changing their physiques. I also train, guide and prepare figure and bikini competitors for competition. This is my passion because I am also a figure competitor and have been for 10 years. After taking 6 years off from competing I found out the NPC now offers a division for figure over 45 and they are offering a pro card for the overall winner. I couldn't resist and got the bug to compete again at the age of 48. It was a challenge and I wondered if I could take my physique to that level of competition as I did 6 years earlier. I had to try and to my surprise I placed 4th at my first competition in age category 40 to 50 at The Emerald Cup. I then went on to compete at Masters Nationals at placed 4th in age category 45 to 50. It was a dream come true at my age. However my goal was to get my IFBB Pro card and the only one that is offered is in the NPC Masters Nationals. Hearing this you might understand why I have to try again and give it my all. My goal is to get my face out there competing in two other shows leading up to Masters Nationals. This will help when I get to Masters Nationals and the judges remember me from the other shows. Becoming a pro will not only be the most rewarding victory for me but it will also give me more credibility with my business and working with my figure clients. Growing my own business has been my dream from day one. I want to be the best I can be at what I do. I want to be the best coach for my figure competitors and other clients. My competitions run from June through July of 2011. I need funds for flight, hotel, competition suits, spray tan, my personal coach, make-up artist and food. Your donation will help me attain my goal!<br/></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Realizing this dream will impact my family and friends in so many ways. The accomplishment will inspire other women around my same age to know they are empowered to pursue their dreams and know that at any age your dreams can come true. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What I Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>The West Port is Edinburgh’s Soho, a heady mix of booze, bosoms, bespoke
 tailoring and BOOKS. It would almost be churlish not to celebrate this 
profusion of pages so we run an annual book festival that plays out over ten wonderful West Port* venues, ranging from singular second-hand 
bookshops to crisp art spaces and whisky-scented pubs. This year the 
2011 WPBF will run from 13-16 October. All events are free.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Run on generosity and goodwill, rather than on any kind of feasible 
budget, the West Port Book Festival has evolved from a brittle idea into
 a redoubtable reality. Our aim has been to offer free events to a 
diverse audience who share our passion for books, bookshops and fun. We 
have also been creative, dipping into the dressing up box, casting our 
eye around for new talent and transforming local shops into intimate, 
innovative venues. Although fond of the past, we're also enthusiastic 
about the future. We organised 
the world's first Literary Twestival in 2009.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>As a freewheeling community festival run by volunteers we're completely reliant on the 
generosity of our supporters. It really does make a difference if you 
can donate even $20 (£12)– or lend us a PA system, then we really would love 
you forever. Bottles of whisky for authors also go down a treat. This 
year we're going to be selling West Port Book Festival badges and 
hand-printed bags and t-shirts to raise money for the festival. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We've managed to scrape together enough pennies to run for the past three years, but there's no room for complacency. We need to go from broke to book festival in 50 days with the help of as many generous supporters as possible. You don't have to be in the US to donate through IndieGoGo; if it's any help, $20 is approximately £12. <br/></p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The West Port has seven bookshops, one bindery, two vintage clothes shops, one rum club and much more. It's a lively and eclectic stretch just off Edinburgh's historic Grassmarket, below the castle. However, it's also an area unfortunately known for its strip joints and the customers they tend to attract. So, our aim has always been to promote the area's bookish assets at a time when bookshops, and other independent shops, need all the help they can get. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Our festival has been running for four years now and has, we hope, made a difference to the brilliant shops in the West Port, and also to the local community. We hope we've made a difference, too, when it comes to giving bookish events, new authors and new ventures a chance. We began with an aim to be a book festival that people who'd never been to a book festival would like to come to: our audiences tell us we're succeeding. <br/></p>

<p>For over 25 years, <strong>Jim Power, aka The Mosaic Man</strong>, has created one of the largest and longest lasting public arts projects with his <strong>Legendary Mosaic Trail</strong>. The trail of whimsical mosaic designs on lamp poles, planters, sidewalks and storefronts throughout New York City are some of the most recognizable and universally acclaimed works by a local artist. The various pieces are often dedicated to an historical event, person, or landmark, i.e. 9/11 or the former Fillmore East, or simply act as sign-posts and markers. The works are, for the most part, created using recycled materials, built to last, unique to the city, and add a great deal to the quality of life in the neighborhood. In 1988, Jim was authorized by the DOT to build up to 80 light poles. In 2004, he was inducted into the City Lore Peoples Hall of Fame and received an official proclamation from Mayor Bloomberg recognizing him for his selfless contribution to the city. Over the years, Jim's work has been featured in countless television programs, newspapers, books and magazines worldwide.</p>
<p><strong><em>All that, and Jim has never received any significant funding for his project from the city or outside groups.</em></strong> And, unfortunately, due to vandalism and destruction, only about a quarter of the lamp posts that make up the original trail are still fully intact.</p>
<p>So, he turns to you...</p>
<p><strong><em>Now, you can help support the rebuilding of The Legendary Mosaic Trail!</em></strong></p>
<p>Jim is as excited as ever to continue his work so that generations to come will enjoy where his whimsical imagination has taken him and his work throughout the years. He hopes you’ll join him on his quest to leave a lasting mark on the city and complete the trail!</p>
<h2><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">What Jim Needs &amp; What You Get</span></h2>
<p>Jim seeks to raise <strong>$80,000</strong> that will go toward rebuilding approximately half of the damaged lamp poles along The Mosaic Trail.</p>
<p>Not only will your contribution help support the rebuilding of a part of New York City history, but you will also receive exciting and unique perks related to the trail itself, from stickers or T-shirts featuring Jim's designs, to one-of-a-kind original pieces of art or ""artwear,"" <strong>to opportunities to have your image or brand included on a pole for all to see! </strong>Read through the perks at right for all the details!</p>
<p>Proceeds will go toward supporting all facets of the rebuilding of the trail:</p>
<ul>
<li>Crew: two teams of up to four workers who will assist Jim with all prepwork, as well as help build out the poles in the field.  </li>
<li>Artistic Materials: tile, salvaged dishware, glass, etc. (Material donations are welcome! Contact Jim if you have materials to offer).</li>
<li>Construction Materials &amp; Tools: glue, grout, mesh, sealer, cutters, scrapers, sponges</li>
<li>Transportation: as you can see in the video above, Jim has severe hip deterioration and is partially disabled. Transportation of people and materials to and from work sites, be it by bus, cab, or motorized scooter will help streamline the daily routine and provide Jim and the crew as much time and relief as possible from the hardships of this very physical work so it may continue unabated.</li>
</ul><h2><strong>The Impact</strong></h2>
<p><strong><em>""My master plan is to draw the anxiety out of the city with beauty."" – Jim Power</em></strong></p>
<p>2012 was quite the year for Jim. With a renewed sense of purpose, he had one of the most prolific creative periods of his artistic career.

For over 25 years, Jim Power, aka The Mosaic Man, has created one of the largest and longest lasting public arts projects with his Legendary Mosaic Trail. The trail of whimsical mosaic designs on lamp poles, planters, sidewalks and storefronts throughout New York City are some of the most recognizable and universally acclaimed works by a local artist. The various pieces are often dedicated to an historical event, person, or landmark, i.e. 9/11 or the former Fillmore East, or simply act as sign-posts and markers. The works are, for the most part, created using recycled materials, built to last, unique to the city, and add a great deal to the quality of life in the neighborhood. In 1988, Jim was authorized by the DOT to build up to 80 light poles. In 2004, he was inducted into the City Lore Peoples Hall of Fame and received an official proclamation from Mayor Bloomberg recognizing him for his selfless contribution to the city. Over the years, Jim's work has been featured in countless television programs, newspapers, books and magazines worldwide.
All that, and Jim has never received any significant funding for his project from the city or outside groups. And, unfortunately, due to vandalism and destruction, only about a quarter of the lamp posts that make up the original trail are still fully intact.
So, he turns to you...
Now, you can help support the rebuilding of The Legendary Mosaic Trail!
Jim is as excited as ever to continue his work so that generations to come will enjoy where his whimsical imagination has taken him and his work throughout the years. He hopes you’ll join him on his quest to leave a lasting mark on the city and complete the trail!
What Jim Needs & What You Get
Jim seeks to raise $80,000 that will go toward rebuilding approximately half of the damaged lamp poles along The Mosaic Trail.
Not only will your contribution help support the rebuilding of a part of New York City history, but you will also receive exciting and unique perks related to the trail itself, from stickers or T-shirts featuring Jim's designs, to one-of-a-kind original pieces of art or ""artwear,"" to opportunities to have your image or brand included on a pole for all to see! Read through the perks at right for all the details!
Proceeds will go toward supporting all facets of the rebuilding of the trail:

Crew: two teams of up to four workers who will assist Jim with all prepwork, as well as help build out the poles in the field.  
Artistic Materials: tile, salvaged dishware, glass, etc. (Material donations are welcome! Contact Jim if you have materials to offer).
Construction Materials & Tools: glue, grout, mesh, sealer, cutters, scrapers, sponges
Transportation: as you can see in the video above, Jim has severe hip deterioration and is partially disabled. Transportation of people and materials to and from work sites, be it by bus, cab, or motorized scooter will help streamline the daily routine and provide Jim and the crew as much time and relief as possible from the hardships of this very physical work so it may continue unabated.
The Impact
""My master plan is to draw the anxiety out of the city with beauty."" – Jim Power
2012 was quite the year for Jim. With a renewed sense of purpose, he had one of the most prolific creative periods of his artistic career. From signage and a series of murals at several local businesses and residential buildings, to various workshops, his involvement with the Tiles For America 9/11 Memorial, producing one-of-a-kind mosaic belt buckles for his Etsy shop, and his continued work on The Legendary Mosaic Trail, Jim was extremely busy!
And his work did not go unnoticed. Jim’s work was featured in The New York Post, The New York Times, The Villager, The Etsy Blog, and he was thrilled when National Geographic named his Mosaic Trail a top downtown destination in their recently published guidebook, “Walking New York.” He was most recently selected as a Featured Artist at the first ever Etsy Holiday Pop-up Shop in SoHo.
But, Jim’s not out for fame. He makes his art for the community that he loves and that loves him so dearly in return. He is, most of all, thankful for the continued support from the people throughout the years. 2013 actually marks the 25th Anniversary since The Village Voice coined the name “Mosaic Man” for Jim. Time sure does fly, but Jim has no plans to slow down. His major aim for the coming years is to see his series of 80 lamp poles along The Legendary Mosaic Trail to completion. 
Jim actually started his very first mosaic lamp pole on Memorial Day weekend, so there would be no more fitting way for ""The Mosaic Man"" to mark the occasion than for him to start on the rebuilding following a successful campaign 25 years later! 
Help Jim fund his campaign by Friday, May 24th and join him as he completes his masterpiece!
Thank you in advance for your generous contribution.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I'm an artist and activist concerned about our fragile environment. In the last year, I've shifted my focus to the conditions of our rivers, shores and ocean and begun to scuba dive in order to take my environmentalism to new depths. One of the most horrific impact things I've learned is the destruction of invasive lionfish.</p>
<p>Lionfish were introduced by irresponsible aquaria owners who released the fish into the wild. With 18 venomous spines and no predators, the lionfish have proliferated into the millions!</p>
<p>In this campaign, I'm selling artwork to sponsor my volunteering in Florida.</p>
<p>Each contribution is greatly appreciated!</p>

<h3>What 's Needed &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Funding defrays the cost of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Travel</li>

<p><strong>What Are We? </strong></p>
<p>We are a production artist paper mill in Minneapolis Minnesota, one of the very few places in the United States still making paper by hand. We are dedicated to teaching interns how to make the rugged and rustically beautiful paper for which we are known worldwide. </p>
<p>After 24 years of operation, we are transitioning to a worker owned cooperative so we can expand papermaking opportunities for artists, interns, and the all members of the community who want to follow their paper arts passions. One of the two original founders has left the business for health reasons, and the other founder would like to retire. Why not continue teaching and making paper as a coop? By Laws and Articles of Incorporation have been written, a business plan and feasibility study is underway, and a membership brochure is written and waiting to be printed. But we are at a critical financial point in our transition, and we need your support.</p>
<p><strong>Where Your Contribution Goes</strong></p>
<p>There are a number of one-time expenses related to our transition, which includes moving our production operations and equipment to a new space which will accommodate multiple worker-owners. It’s shocking how much new electrical wiring, a rigger that moves the machinery, and our raw material costs. Additional transition expenses include fees for accounting, tax filing, legal consulting, and travel to trade fairs and conferences to promote the coop. In the unfortunate event we are unable to meet our financial goal, your donations will go towards the expenses in the order listed. In appreciation for your contributions, we have a variety of cool perks including handmade paper, credit towards coop membership, handmade books, stationary, artist's books, and more.</p>
<p><strong>What We Do </strong><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">These are just some of the wonderful endeavors that we have been bringing to its local and international community. If we close, here is what would be lost:</span></p>
<p>- The unique paper we produce, which is valued by artists worldwide for its strength, durability, deep coloration, rugged beauty, handmade quality, and lack of chemical ingredients. Our paper  been used for diverse art projects, including hand-bound books durable enough to be passed down for generations, and large sculptural works of art. Its loss would impact the creative opportunities of many artists, both current and those yet to come.</p>
<p>- An educational resource with a well-established internship program that has trained over 120 interns in all facets of hand papermaking production. Our interns have gone on to not only production hand papermaking, but also the fields of paper art, museum curating, paper distribution and sales, bookbinding, paper and art conservation, education and more.</p>
<p>- A facility where people can utilize and expand their skills in the pursuit of their own creative works. The facility provides an opportunity to pass along the knowledge and experience of production hand papermaking methods acquired over 24 years of operation to a broad community of people.</p>
<p>- A paper mill that caters to special orders for creative projects. For example, We made a 60 foot sheet of paper strong enough to be folded into a life-sized origami elephant.</p>
<p>- A creative force with a track record of expanding the potential of handmade paper by collaborating with respected and internationally known artists, and for promoting this underappreciated craft. Collaboration directs concepts and technical know-how towards a shared purpose. Artistic experimentation with handmade paper creates remarkable energy and produces dynamic work.</p>
<p><strong>The Future Coop</strong></p>
<p>We need your support to continue working towards opening as a coop. It will be feasible to secure the financial future of us with worker owner artists who will make and sell paper to provide continuing revenue, and investment owners to provide further funding.</p>
<p>Worker owners will also have the opportunity to pursue their own artistic and commercial paper arts projects with full use of the equipment at the mill.</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>In addition to your contribution, or if you are unable to make a financial contribution at this time, please help us get the word out about our campaign. Use your social media favorites to let people know about us with a link to our campaign. We would welcome help in other ways too, such as legal input, accounting services, and more.</p>
<p><strong>Keep Us Alive</strong></p>
<p>Handmade paper is more than a means to an end, it is a carrier of knowledge. We help people realize their artistic endeavors, a romanticized version of its industrial counterpart.</p>
<p>Finished papers are works of art in themselves, exhibiting tactile textures and soft finishes on thick, crisp sheets, strong enough to make books and art that will be passed down many generations. Please help us pass us down to future generations.</p>
<p>We greatly appreciate your ongoing support. Every level of contribution helps.</p>
<p>Keep us alive!</p>
<p><strong>About Us</strong></p>
<p>Amanda Degener is one of our two original founders. It is her strong desire to pass along the knowledge and experience of production hand papermaking, and the legacy, to the next generation. She believes it is important to keep us open as an education center teaching interns the production of rugged and rusticly beautiful paper for which we are known worldwide.</p>
<p>Amanda Degener obtained her Master’s Degree from Yale School of Art, where she used her own handmade paper to realize ideas in large-scale sculpture. In 1985, she co-founded the not-for-profit organization called Hand Papermaking Magazine whose primary focus was publishing the biannual Hand Papermaking Magazine. (Hand Papermaking is based in Twin Cities and still publishing biannually), For three years Amanda Degener was the first Artist-in-Residence at the fledgling Minnesota Center for Book Arts and later became their first Artistic Director. She has co-organized four national hand papermaking conferences as well as lectured, taught, and exhibited her work around the world. Teaching locations include China, Sweden, Japan, Italy, Taiwan, and the United States. Her community service work includes serving on multiple local and national boards of directors including Forecast Public Art and Haystack School.</p>
<p>James Kleiner is our first employee, hired primarily to pull sheets of paper. He is a graduate of the Minneapolis College of Art and Design and is currently a member of Hack Factory and Leg Up Studio. James has exhibited his work locally, nationally, and in China. The Minnesota Regional Arts Commission awarded James The Next Step Grant to explore the crafting of traditional hand papermaking moulds. James was also featured in Hand Papermaking Magazine’s issue devoted to artists under 30 or the future of the hand papermaking field. The article included a tipped in paper sample of his making in each copy of the issue. He was chosen as a key player in the next generation of papermakers and paper artists because his work reflects technical and artistic experimentation in hand papermaking.</p>
<p><strong>Quotes from Our Supporters</strong></p>
<p>Mark Dimunation, Rare Book &amp; Special Collections Division Library of Congress</p>
<p>“The Library of Congress holds in their collection books made with our Paper. Our willingness to work with artisans to produce just the right paper for a specific project can be seen in The Lost Journals of Sacajawea by Debra Magpie Earling and Peter Koch. The publisher, Peter Koch commissioned us to make Walnut dyed flax to look and feel like buffalo hide. This ""hide"" paper is an integral part of the success of this book.”</p>
<p>Timothy Barrett, MacArthur Fellow/Papermaker/Author/Educator</p>
<p>“Paper has a long history of perseverance, commitment, hard work, innovation, artist collaborations, training younger folks in the field, and generally inspiring the entire hand papermaking community.  Their new future direction is well worth our support and enthusiastic backing. Please contribute whatever you can and together we will help us make this transition as smooth and rewarding as possible for all concerned!”</p>
<p>Verra Blough, Paper Department Manager at Wet Paint Artists’ Materials &amp; Framing</p>
<p>“We are very fortunate to stock Papers at Wet Paint…they are truly a beautiful collection of handmade papers.  That they are locally-made is a major plus, too! Papers are sought out by name by a variety of discerning artists, from book makers to designers, printmakers to photographers.  Anytime I show Papers to my customers, I get the “Whoa, I love that!” response!

<p>“Paper is one of the few studios in the world where artists, bookmakers and craftspeople can acquire sheets of unique and durable handmade paper. It is a studio where young artists, conservators, and bookmakers can learn about the traditional craft, as well as the art of handmade paper. Paper is approaching their 25th year in business, and they need a little help from us so that they can continue for another 25. Paper is an integral part of the papermaking scene, and I hope you will join me in supporting their new venture as well as the future of hand papermaking!“</p>

<p>“Amanda Degener and Bridget O'Malley were the two brave women who pioneered the production of papers literally in a cave, hence our name. The papers are the strongest papers on the market and can be used for covering books if leather is not an option.  The colors and designs are unique, including Degener Black and O'Malley Crackle. Talas has had a wonderful relationship with the Cave company since we purchased Talas in 1994. The relationship is continuing with the coop. Our customers, bookbinders and artists love the papers for their unique quality and we recently added some new additions to our inventory.”</p>

We are a production artist paper mill in Minneapolis Minnesota, one of the very few places in the United States still making paper by hand. We are dedicated to teaching interns how to make the rugged and rustically beautiful paper for which we are known worldwide. 
After 24 years of operation, we are transitioning to a worker owned cooperative so we can expand papermaking opportunities for artists, interns, and the all members of the community who want to follow their paper arts passions. One of the two original founders has left the business for health reasons, and the other founder would like to retire. Why not continue teaching and making paper as a coop? By Laws and Articles of Incorporation have been written, a business plan and feasibility study is underway, and a membership brochure is written and waiting to be printed. But we are at a critical financial point in our transition, and we need your support.
Where Your Contribution Goes
There are a number of one-time expenses related to our transition, which includes moving our production operations and equipment to a new space which will accommodate multiple worker-owners. It’s shocking how much new electrical wiring, a rigger that moves the machinery, and our raw material costs. Additional transition expenses include fees for accounting, tax filing, legal consulting, and travel to trade fairs and conferences to promote the coop. In the unfortunate event we are unable to meet our financial goal, your donations will go towards the expenses in the order listed. In appreciation for your contributions, we have a variety of cool perks including handmade paper, credit towards coop membership, handmade books, stationary, artist's books, and more.
What We Do These are just some of the wonderful endeavors that we have been bringing to its local and international community. If we close, here is what would be lost:
- The unique paper we produce, which is valued by artists worldwide for its strength, durability, deep coloration, rugged beauty, handmade quality, and lack of chemical ingredients. Our paper  been used for diverse art projects, including hand-bound books durable enough to be passed down for generations, and large sculptural works of art. Its loss would impact the creative opportunities of many artists, both current and those yet to come.
- An educational resource with a well-established internship program that has trained over 120 interns in all facets of hand papermaking production. Our interns have gone on to not only production hand papermaking, but also the fields of paper art, museum curating, paper distribution and sales, bookbinding, paper and art conservation, education and more.
- A facility where people can utilize and expand their skills in the pursuit of their own creative works. The facility provides an opportunity to pass along the knowledge and experience of production hand papermaking methods acquired over 24 years of operation to a broad community of people.
- A paper mill that caters to special orders for creative projects. For example, We made a 60 foot sheet of paper strong enough to be folded into a life-sized origami elephant.
- A creative force with a track record of expanding the potential of handmade paper by collaborating with respected and internationally known artists, and for promoting this underappreciated craft. Collaboration directs concepts and technical know-how towards a shared purpose. Artistic experimentation with handmade paper creates remarkable energy and produces dynamic work.
The Future Coop
We need your support to continue working towards opening as a coop. It will be feasible to secure the financial future of us with worker owner artists who will make and sell paper to provide continuing revenue, and investment owners to provide further funding.
Worker owners will also have the opportunity to pursue their own artistic and commercial paper arts projects with full use of the equipment at the mill.
Other Ways You Can Help
In addition to your contribution, or if you are unable to make a financial contribution at this time, please help us get the word out about our campaign. Use your social media favorites to let people know about us with a link to our campaign. We would welcome help in other ways too, such as legal input, accounting services, and more.
Keep Us Alive
Handmade paper is more than a means to an end, it is a carrier of knowledge. We help people realize their artistic endeavors, a romanticized version of its industrial counterpart.
Finished papers are works of art in themselves, exhibiting tactile textures and soft finishes on thick, crisp sheets, strong enough to make books and art that will be passed down many generations. Please help us pass us down to future generations.
We greatly appreciate your ongoing support. Every level of contribution helps.
Keep us alive!
About Us
Amanda Degener is one of our two original founders. It is her strong desire to pass along the knowledge and experience of production hand papermaking, and the legacy, to the next generation. She believes it is important to keep us open as an education center teaching interns the production of rugged and rusticly beautiful paper for which we are known worldwide.
Amanda Degener obtained her Master’s Degree from Yale School of Art, where she used her own handmade paper to realize ideas in large-scale sculpture. In 1985, she co-founded the not-for-profit organization called Hand Papermaking Magazine whose primary focus was publishing the biannual Hand Papermaking Magazine. (Hand Papermaking is based in Twin Cities and still publishing biannually), For three years Amanda Degener was the first Artist-in-Residence at the fledgling Minnesota Center for Book Arts and later became their first Artistic Director. She has co-organized four national hand papermaking conferences as well as lectured, taught, and exhibited her work around the world. Teaching locations include China, Sweden, Japan, Italy, Taiwan, and the United States. Her community service work includes serving on multiple local and national boards of directors including Forecast Public Art and Haystack School.
James Kleiner is our first employee, hired primarily to pull sheets of paper. He is a graduate of the Minneapolis College of Art and Design and is currently a member of Hack Factory and Leg Up Studio. James has exhibited his work locally, nationally, and in China. The Minnesota Regional Arts Commission awarded James The Next Step Grant to explore the crafting of traditional hand papermaking moulds. James was also featured in Hand Papermaking Magazine’s issue devoted to artists under 30 or the future of the hand papermaking field. The article included a tipped in paper sample of his making in each copy of the issue. He was chosen as a key player in the next generation of papermakers and paper artists because his work reflects technical and artistic experimentation in hand papermaking.
Quotes from Our Supporters
Mark Dimunation, Rare Book & Special Collections Division Library of Congress
“The Library of Congress holds in their collection books made with our Paper. Our willingness to work with artisans to produce just the right paper for a specific project can be seen in The Lost Journals of Sacajawea by Debra Magpie Earling and Peter Koch. The publisher, Peter Koch commissioned us to make Walnut dyed flax to look and feel like buffalo hide. This ""hide"" paper is an integral part of the success of this book.”
Timothy Barrett, MacArthur Fellow/Papermaker/Author/Educator
“Paper has a long history of perseverance, commitment, hard work, innovation, artist collaborations, training younger folks in the field, and generally inspiring the entire hand papermaking community.  Their new future direction is well worth our support and enthusiastic backing. Please contribute whatever you can and together we will help us make this transition as smooth and rewarding as possible for all concerned!”
Verra Blough, Paper Department Manager at Wet Paint Artists’ Materials & Framing
“We are very fortunate to stock Papers at Wet Paint…they are truly a beautiful collection of handmade papers.  That they are locally-made is a major plus, too! Papers are sought out by name by a variety of discerning artists, from book makers to designers, printmakers to photographers.  Anytime I show Papers to my customers, I get the “Whoa, I love that!” response! My personal favorite is the Solid Indigo. It’s so rich in color and texture, it’s really like nothing else. The skill and passion that goes into making Papers is evident in every single sheet.”

<p>BrushKnob is a very simple control device that allows the user to intuitively operate Photoshop tools. There are only 2 functions: a) the knob controls the brush size, and b) the switch allows you to switch between the brush and the eraser tools.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kmwtr/chinchilla_systems/master/brushknob/assets/BKIsWorking_min.gif"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Typical keyboard signals are used in the transmission with the computer so you will not need to install a special, separate driver. All you need to do is to connect the cable to your computer and the device will work.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kmwtr/chinchilla_systems/master/brushknob/assets/HowItWorksPicto_min.gif"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The computer recognizes BrushKnob as an extra keyboard. When you turn the knob or press the button, the system interprets the signals as keyboard shortcuts. BrushKnob can therefore be used with any application (not just Photoshop) as long as the same keyboard shortcuts are assigned.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kmwtr/chinchilla_systems/b08b51f2d9c32e93adbd8aa41f9c370275fd71a5/brushknob/assets/BKWithBlender.gif"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Of course if you so wish for it, you can change the keyboard shortcut settings on the application side. It is possible to use BrushKnob in various ways.</p>

<p>I am very confident that artists and creators throughout the world will find this prototype a useful and nifty tool to have. It is my dream for BrushKnob to eventually be bundled in a proper package and delivered to people around the world.</p>

The concept behind BrushKnob


My name is Wataru Kami. I am currently working as a concept artist at a production company in Tokyo, Japan. I am also a creator in the broader sense when I go home to my keyboard and soldering iron.

About a year ago, I started to sketch in between my breaks at work, then testing these prototypes on real jobs which later led to the completion of this device: BrushKnob.

BrushKnob is a very simple control device that allows the user to intuitively operate Photoshop tools. There are only 2 functions: a) the knob controls the brush size, and b) the switch allows you to switch between the brush and the eraser tools.

Typical keyboard signals are used in the transmission with the computer so you will not need to install a special, separate driver. All you need to do is to connect the cable to your computer and the device will work.

The computer recognizes BrushKnob as an extra keyboard. When you turn the knob or press the button, the system interprets the signals as keyboard shortcuts. BrushKnob can therefore be used with any application (not just Photoshop) as long as the same keyboard shortcuts are assigned.

Of course if you so wish for it, you can change the keyboard shortcut settings on the application side. It is possible to use BrushKnob in various ways.

I am very confident that artists and creators throughout the world will find this prototype a useful and nifty tool to have. It is my dream for BrushKnob to eventually be bundled in a proper package and delivered to people around the world.


Features


BrushKnob not only has a GPLv3 license. It has through-holes at the bottom of the body enabling easy access to all pins of the ATtiny85 micro controller.




D.F.Mac. who is also making the devices using AVR has made MIDI library called VUSBMidiAttiny compatible with BrushKnob!
As such, you can customize BrushKnob easily, if you have knowledge of AVR or Arduino!

* BrushKnob's behavior is dependent on the computer's keyboard settings. ""BrushKnob Standard"" is programmed to function correctly on computers connected to English keyboards. (and ""JP Ver"" sends Japanese keyboard signals. If you have US keyboard PC/Mac, please choose the ""Standard"" type.)
*BrushKnobの挙動はPCのキーボード設定に依存します。英語キーボードが接続されているPCでは「BrushKnob Standard」を、日本語キーボードが接続されているPCで使用する場合は「BrushKnob JP Ver.」を選んでください。また、OSの言語設定自体には影響されません。（たとえば、日本語キーボードが接続された環境の多くでは、「BrushKnob Standard」をつなげた場合、'[' ではなく '@' が入力されます。）


Funding Plan & Timeline

While I plan to modify and improve BrushKnob's design based on mass production numbers, most of the usable operations are already completed at this time. I really hope that many people will support my product!

If I manage to raise enough fund, I would also like to include printed logo stickers with BrushKnob too. Long live stickers!


Risks & Challenges


Although BrushKnob is a very simple prototype, I will need to overcome many, extremely complicated processes in order to have it mass produced and delivered to every one. I am a professional designer and prudent in my planning. This is not likely to change in the future. Nevertheless, I know that I am new to this and supporters of myself and my product will undoubtedly have to face some risks. Therefore I would like to express my deepest gratitude and thanks in advance to every one who decides to support me. I promise to do my best. Please help by purchasing BrushKnob!


Other Ways You Can Help


For those whose hardware/software is not compatible with my device, please feel free to visit my website. I will be very happy if anyone is interested in the anime, games, or even individual works listed there!
Last but not least, please introduce BrushKnob to your friends if you think they might be interested in it. Thank you.

<p>I have spent the last three years of my college career working in as many museums as I can, learning more and more about public relations, exhibition design, and even things as seemingly simple as how to properly hang a painting on a wall. <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">I am currently working at Pomona College Museum of Art, archiving work and documentation of internationally known artist James Turrell.

<h3>About my Project</h3>
<p>I am creating a two-part thesis that explores the musical and visual culture of a
period of time in Spain called “La Movida.” Occurring between the mid seventies
to the mid eighties, “La Movida” is characterized by the disillusioned,
apolitical, and largely unemployed young demographic that emerged following
Francisco Franco’s death in 1975. I plan on creating an online presence in the
form of a website where I will write a series of articles and essays on a
variety of topics ranging from feminism, to Pedro Almodovar's role in Madrid's visual culture, to the dissemination and distribution of Spanish New Wave music during “La Movida.”
I will include photographs and music videos alongside these articles to better
illustrate the importance of visual culture during this formative decade. By the end of next semester, I plan on converting my website into a hard-copy bilingual catalogue.</p>
<p>As a
second part to my thesis, I will present an exhibition on “La Movida” featuring
original vinyl albums, poster artifacts, video projections, and exhibition
quality prints from artist Mary Ellen Mark with the purpose of reviving this
visual culture for a group of my peers as well as the Los Angeles community. </p>

Very quickly make things, but also discover what you can do with them. Make a ball that can roll, or a boat that really floats. Make a house or a hat, the possibility is endless.After over 4 months of fun work dreaming up and answering the question, ""What's a Geodo?"", it feels really close to being a finished product. Geodo is simple and creative fun, but also a bit puzzling to keep the mind fully engaged.Please pre-order your Geodo's today so we can build momentum and really go into this with a lot of enthusiasm and sucess.After getting quotes and dealing with many of the manufactures who cut out foam mats and those ABC bath-time letters, I have developed and mocked up several really cool Geodo Sets. I have cut all these parts out by hand to save on start-up costs. But the real thing will be die cut out of the same EVA foam from a professional facility, yielding smoother edges and perfectly rounded corners. The major cost involved in getting someone to punch these out is the tooling of the machine that will punch them and ordering all the colored foam stock in large rolls.  Our rewards are priced as follows:Prices include US shipping, for international shipping add $20.About the Geodo BrainStorm Soundtrack:Every Geodo set includes creativity enhancing music made by video game composer Bryn Braughton. I worked with Bryn continuously throughout the development of the shapes as he interpreted them into music. It really is a stunning production that gets kids dancing and playing freely. All of the music in the video comes from this exclusive soundtrack.About The 100 Geodo Creations Instructional DVD:
We are also working on a 100 Geodo Creations Instructional DVD, chock full of ideas to get you started. This video production will offer step by step instructions for creating all kinds of float-able and wearable creations. This DVD is included with all donations of  $75 and above.FUNDING BREAKDOWN
We need to raise $16,000 in order to bring Geodos from concept to reality! This will cover our start-up costs as well as the costs for artwork, countless hours of testing, and materials that have already been invested.The Production Costs:
Manufacturing cost
Overseas Freight from Manufacturing
US Import Duties & Port Logistics
DVD & Case Manufacture
Geodo Soundtrack Music Royalty & Licensing
Toy Containers / Label & Packing
Shipping Boxes

<h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Over the years this mural has become a Crown Heights landmark. Across the street from the Botanic Gardens and Prospect Park It has been viewed by thousands of New Yorkers and visitors from all over the world. In a community of residents, commuters, tourist, friends, supporters and young adults, who were teenagers when it was first painted. It is a landmark attraction in this neighborhood. People take pictures of themselves with their families under the images and point out the many animals to their children and friends. Other artist from various disciplines use this mural as a backdrop for their own projects. This is a working community mural. It's function and beauty has served many people since 1998. The restoration of this mural is paramount to this community.

Hudzo creates large-scale kinetic sculptures, best described as <b>stroboscopic zoetropes</b>, that animate universal questions and metaphorical states to transport the viewer into contemplative, transcendental realities</p>
<h3><b>What is a Stroboscopic Zoetrope?</b></h3>
<p>Zoetropes are remarkably qualified to portray the cyclical nature of life. A zoetrope is a cylindrical device that produces the illusion of motion from a rapid succession of static pictures. Instead of drawings and shutters, Hudzo uses sculptures and strobe lights to achieve the same effect, creating a three-dimensional motion picture. </p>
<p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/398902/files/20140227121509-Screen_shot_2014-02-19_at_6.30.55_PM.png?1393532109"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p>The central focus of Hudzo's art is dedicated to creating these large-scale stroboscopic zoetropes that engage environment, body, and spirit, while pushing the boundaries of kinetic sculpture. All of these works are interactive, and often bear the visual hallmarks of pure invention – incorporating a whimsical mix of interlocking gears, spinning wheels, repetitive motion, and cyclical action. Through touch or physical labor, the public is invited to power the sculpture directly, activating dream-like optical effects or mesmerizing mechanical events.  Beyond the meditative imagery involving <i>cycles</i> or <i>fortitude</i>, the frenetic aspects of his sculpture impart serious questions regarding existence, progress (or lack thereof), consumption and routine.</p>
<p>Earlier works have focused on darker themes, the Sisyphean drudgery of repetitive , never-ending punishment, such as <a href=""http://vimeo.com/30968839"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://vimeo.com/30968839"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Charon</a>,</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/398900/files/20140227121449-Charon_by_Peter_Hudson.png?1393532089"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p>and, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEW6yosg-0w"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Homouroboros</a>, which was recently on exhibit at The Exploratorium, the museum of science, art and human perception, in San Francisco.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/398890/files/20140227121332-Screen_shot_2014-02-26_at_3.28.53_PM.png?1393532012"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p>
<p>In contrast, Eternal Return celebrates the joy and ecstasy of life, not just repeated, but begun anew.</p>
<h3><b>Tell me about Eternal Return...</b></h3>
<p>The concept of the Eternal Return speculates that the universe has been recurring, and will continue to recur, in a self-similar form, an infinite number of times across infinite time and space. This concept is touched upon in virtually all cultural and religious narratives.</p>
<p>Hudzo likes to leave his work a mystery to be unveiled only at the Playa, so the rest is up to imagination [and some updates along the way], however rest assured, you will not be disappointed, </p>
<blockquote><i>""I have been blessed with the opportunity to realize some of my wildest fantasies. And I’d like to have you be part of the next fantasy. Trust me, if you've liked my earlier works, you'll love Eternal Return!""</i></blockquote>
<h3><b>How can I help complete Eternal Return?</b></h3>
<p>The creative process begins with the vision of the artist but requires the hands, hearts, and support of a dedicated community to transition from the drawing board to a fully immersive experience.

We have five months to complete Hudzo's long awaited and most dynamic piece yet, Eternal Return, and we need your help!Who is Hudzo?Meet artist and designer, Peter Hudson. Hudzo creates large-scale kinetic sculptures, best described as stroboscopic zoetropes, that animate universal questions and metaphorical states to transport the viewer into contemplative, transcendental realities
What is a Stroboscopic Zoetrope?
Zoetropes are remarkably qualified to portray the cyclical nature of life. A zoetrope is a cylindrical device that produces the illusion of motion from a rapid succession of static pictures. Instead of drawings and shutters, Hudzo uses sculptures and strobe lights to achieve the same effect, creating a three-dimensional motion picture. 
The central focus of Hudzo's art is dedicated to creating these large-scale stroboscopic zoetropes that engage environment, body, and spirit, while pushing the boundaries of kinetic sculpture. All of these works are interactive, and often bear the visual hallmarks of pure invention – incorporating a whimsical mix of interlocking gears, spinning wheels, repetitive motion, and cyclical action. Through touch or physical labor, the public is invited to power the sculpture directly, activating dream-like optical effects or mesmerizing mechanical events.  Beyond the meditative imagery involving cycles or fortitude, the frenetic aspects of his sculpture impart serious questions regarding existence, progress (or lack thereof), consumption and routine.
Earlier works have focused on darker themes, the Sisyphean drudgery of repetitive , never-ending punishment, such as Charon,and, Homouroboros, which was recently on exhibit at The Exploratorium, the museum of science, art and human perception, in San Francisco.
In contrast, Eternal Return celebrates the joy and ecstasy of life, not just repeated, but begun anew.
Tell me about Eternal Return...
The concept of the Eternal Return speculates that the universe has been recurring, and will continue to recur, in a self-similar form, an infinite number of times across infinite time and space. This concept is touched upon in virtually all cultural and religious narratives.
Hudzo likes to leave his work a mystery to be unveiled only at the Playa, so the rest is up to imagination [and some updates along the way], however rest assured, you will not be disappointed, 
""I have been blessed with the opportunity to realize some of my wildest fantasies. And I’d like to have you be part of the next fantasy. Trust me, if you've liked my earlier works, you'll love Eternal Return!""
How can I help complete Eternal Return?
The creative process begins with the vision of the artist but requires the hands, hearts, and support of a dedicated community to transition from the drawing board to a fully immersive experience. We would be honored if you participated in making this a reality. Your contributions are essential to the success of Eternal Return. 
We have been working on Eternal Return since early 2013, these sculptures take thousands of hours to build and cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to create. We are halfway to completion, and we really need your help! 
Please, Donate now and receive some great perks!
Our goal is to have Eternal Return complete for Burning Man 2014. We'll send every generous funder a perk that represents the sculpture and be Eternally Grateful.

<p>My name is Natalia and I am an artist.<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> However, for most of my life I didn't allow myself to embody it. Fearful of the term ""starving artist"" and all that society has heaped on the artist's shoulders, </span>alongside<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> being a full time single mother, I have created a work life for myself that is neither emotionally fulfilling nor monetarily </span>sustainable. After many years, I am finally realizing how the arts are an integral part of society and without the artist our lives would be very dim indeed. I believe there is a paradigm shift happening where peoples' true callings are being put into play and we are allowed to flourish. It is no longer necessary for an artist to be starving - we feed the world and ourselves with what we create.</p>
<p>Life has taken us all down many paths. We have all known joy, fear, happiness, longing, and love. There are some paths I might not have chosen knowing the outcome, but they were certainly the ones I was meant to walk. These avenues have made me who I am today, but I am now <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">ready to choose a path that is calling to me - the path I am meant to walk. This path whispers to me and causes little champagne bubbles of joy to fill my heart. I know now that art is my true vocation; to inspire others through my creations and in turn encourage them to create. </span></p>

personally know me and into the world. <br/></p><p>Part of my growth as a
professional artist and entrepreneur includes researching grants, residencies
and fellowships so I can further my education and broaden my experiences. </p>
<p>As my vision expands, it is a
dream of mine to share my knowledge as an artist with both adults and children.
The outlet of creating is such an important means of expression and I feel too
little of it is taught and encouraged in communities and schools today. Artists communicate through their
work and I want to guide others to find this expression within 
oneself. One
of my goals is to get to a point where I can build a studio to teach and mentor students to explore
their own uniqueness and allow this expression to flow into the world through
art of their own.

excited and eager to explore including book illustrations and commissioned

campaign came when I completed my taxes earlier this year. I work 
multiple jobs, including administrative work, caring for a beautiful woman who is living with 
Alzheimer’s, and
freelance graphic design - all while being a full-time single mom. In 2014, I grossed a little over $25,000. <br/><br/>Last spring, I sold my first painting and was encouraged when a patron offered a considerably larger amount of money than what I had asked for initially - because she said it was worth more.

</div></div>","My name is Natalia and I am an artist. However, for most of my life I didn't allow myself to embody it. Fearful of the term ""starving artist"" and all that society has heaped on the artist's shoulders, alongside being a full time single mother, I have created a work life for myself that is neither emotionally fulfilling nor monetarily sustainable. After many years, I am finally realizing how the arts are an integral part of society and without the artist our lives would be very dim indeed. I believe there is a paradigm shift happening where peoples' true callings are being put into play and we are allowed to flourish. It is no longer necessary for an artist to be starving - we feed the world and ourselves with what we create.
Life has taken us all down many paths. We have all known joy, fear, happiness, longing, and love. There are some paths I might not have chosen knowing the outcome, but they were certainly the ones I was meant to walk. These avenues have made me who I am today, but I am now ready to choose a path that is calling to me - the path I am meant to walk. This path whispers to me and causes little champagne bubbles of joy to fill my heart. I know now that art is my true vocation; to inspire others through my creations and in turn encourage them to create. 




                                     ""Gaia"" mixed media on aquabord, 2015 - SOLD

﻿My vision as an enterprising
artist is to create a sizable body of work so I can produce my very first
show by the middle of 2016! With this foundation of heart and soul-inspired
work, I will revamp my website as well as set up sites on society6 and/or Etsy, so I can share my art beyond those who
personally know me and into the world. Part of my growth as a
professional artist and entrepreneur includes researching grants, residencies
and fellowships so I can further my education and broaden my experiences. 
As my vision expands, it is a
dream of mine to share my knowledge as an artist with both adults and children.
The outlet of creating is such an important means of expression and I feel too
little of it is taught and encouraged in communities and schools today. Artists communicate through their
work and I want to guide others to find this expression within 
oneself. One
of my goals is to get to a point where I can build a studio to teach and mentor students to explore
their own uniqueness and allow this expression to flow into the world through
art of their own. 
There are many opportunities I am
excited and eager to explore including book illustrations and commissioned
work!                                       ""Untitled"" mixed media on aquabord , 2015To be completely honest the entire idea for my
campaign came when I completed my taxes earlier this year. I work 
multiple jobs, including administrative work, caring for a beautiful woman who is living with 
Alzheimer’s, and
freelance graphic design - all while being a full-time single mom. In 2014, I grossed a little over $25,000. Last spring, I sold my first painting and was encouraged when a patron offered a considerably larger amount of money than what I had asked for initially - because she said it was worth more. Many times over the 
years, I have been asked why I am not full time artist? Due to my full work schedule, I can only carve out so much time to create. Would you consider investing in this vision and make a generous contribution?  Your support to help launch my 
career is all it would take. I know by using your gift coupled with my marketing, 
administrative, and organizational skills and experience - as well as my talent - I can live into my calling full-time... if I have seed 
funding to launch. 
I am so grateful to you for supporting me in my journey to living and sharing the most
abundant and fullest version of myself.  
Please take a peek to the right. I have listed many Perks for you in an array of price ranges. I would love to have to opportunity to share my work with you! You are also able to donate any amount of funds, so if you would like to donate $1 or $100,000, you can! Any amount would be acknowledged and seriously appreciated!All gifts will be acknowledged in my
first show brochure and on my website.Perks to be delivered no later than December of 2016.                                                      ""Hope"" collage on paper, 2014

If
 you cannot currently contribute, I would appreciate any 
shares on social media, via email or word of mouth.  I would be extremely grateful for any form of help from you!  Tell your 
friends, followers - anyone you feel might be interested in some of 
the perks, or who would just want to lend a helping hand. 
At the top of this page you can find Indiegogo's share tools and use 
them to share my campaign on Facebook, Twitter, Google+, etc.·  Thank you to Lisa Genova, my unofficial and much revered mentor She is an advocate for artists to whom I humbly give my gratitude.
·  Thank you to Jennifer Currie, my friend and ceaseless encourager. Without her gentle nudging, I would not be where I am today.·  Thank you to my daughters, Miranda & Fionna, who inspire me with their amazing courage and self-assuredness. To my sister, Nadia, and brother-in-law, Jared, for their love and support - and to my incredible parents, Wasyl and Daria, immigrants from Ukraine, who would have never dreamt of this possibility for me even with their unyielding faith in me.·  Thank you to Gregory for inspiring me to embrace the best version of myself.·  Thanks to YOU! Whether you contribute to my campaign, share my campaign, or just silently send me well wishes. I honor you and hope you will strive to achieve your dreams! 
Thank you so much!

<p><br/></p> <p>Hi my name is JT Liss. I am a 32-year-old artist and educator living in East Harlem. About 4 years ago I resigned from a full-time teaching position to pursue my passion in photographic art and use it as a catalyst for social change. Since then I have had numerous exhibits in NYC, and throughout the US, and have been able to raise money from the sales of my work to help support organizations advocating for social change. My work is rooted in storytelling, so much of it is paired with a poem or story to further explain each piece. My belief is that if a new thought can enter the mind, even for the briefest of moments, then change has a chance. </p>
<p>The past year has been extremely exciting with exhibitions, benefits, and most recently, being asked to have a solo exhibit at Crisolart Gallery in Barcelona, Spain. </p>

The truth is, I feel weird about it, myself. However, the other truth is that I am an artist. An artist who hustles day in and day out to keep this dream alive. An artist who is proud to say that he has sold enough work to be able to afford to live in New York City without the help of others. An artist who needs a little extra support to reach the next step in his career. With your help, I will be able to reach that next step by exhibiting in a gallery, who prides themselves on discovering new up-and-coming talent, for the entire month of August (see image below).

<p><b>About
//</b><a href=""http://www.trchova.cz/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><br/></a></p><p><a href=""http://www.trchova.cz/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Martina Trchova Trio</a> is a folk/blues/jazz
fusion band based in Prague, CZ. The main singer, Martina Trchova, taught a handful
of students from Syracuse University, Bowdin College, Elon, and American
University. </p>
<p>My name is Iara and I was one of the students
from Syracuse University and director of the music video. During my time
abroad, Martina and her band helped me feel at home in Prague. Their music
brings memories and emotions of the past and present in a way that is
reflective and quaint. As a human, Martina is someone who is invested in every
single student and person and acts as their number 1 supporter/fan for their
artistic dreams. Her quality of life is inspirational and reflective and this
music video is a chance for people to give back to her and all that she has
given to us. </p>
<p>What I set out to do for this music video was to create a compilation of people’s passions and artistic expressions. How I
like to describe the video is a collaborative music video where the talents of
each crewmember, dancer, and member of production are visualized and captured. </p>
<p>With your help in making this music video we
can make everyone’s creativity seen. Specifically, we can buy materials to
build the set, give the shadow dancers unified costumes, feed and nourish the
crew and dancers, and reserve slots at the soundstage in Onondaga County, NY. <br/></p><p><br/></p><b>Story //</b><span> </span><br/>An unfaithful girl walks home and is faced
with obstacles brought on by a one-night-stand. On the walk-of-shame back home,
she encounters memories of people who have come into her life, led her to a
new path, and then disappeared in an instant. 

<p><br/>
<br/>
<b><span>Short
Summary //</span></b><br/></p><p>This music video serves to invigorate
emotions and show a woman being unfaithful to a man, rather than visa versa.

</p><p>There’s a main dancer, Tina
who wakes up next to her last night passion and leaves to walk home on the
cobble streets of Prague. On her walk home, she is surrounded by shadowed
figures that dance around her trying to bring her down one path or another. She
overtakes them with a dance of her own passions and then arrives at home
alone, hiding from her past mistakes. <br/></p><p><br/></p><p></p>

//Martina Trchova Trio is a folk/blues/jazz
fusion band based in Prague, CZ. The main singer, Martina Trchova, taught a handful
of students from Syracuse University, Bowdin College, Elon, and American
University. 
My name is Iara and I was one of the students
from Syracuse University and director of the music video. During my time
abroad, Martina and her band helped me feel at home in Prague. Their music
brings memories and emotions of the past and present in a way that is
reflective and quaint. As a human, Martina is someone who is invested in every
single student and person and acts as their number 1 supporter/fan for their
artistic dreams. Her quality of life is inspirational and reflective and this
music video is a chance for people to give back to her and all that she has
given to us. 
What I set out to do for this music video was to create a compilation of people’s passions and artistic expressions. How I
like to describe the video is a collaborative music video where the talents of
each crewmember, dancer, and member of production are visualized and captured. 
With your help in making this music video we
can make everyone’s creativity seen. Specifically, we can buy materials to
build the set, give the shadow dancers unified costumes, feed and nourish the
crew and dancers, and reserve slots at the soundstage in Onondaga County, NY. Story // An unfaithful girl walks home and is faced
with obstacles brought on by a one-night-stand. On the walk-of-shame back home,
she encounters memories of people who have come into her life, led her to a
new path, and then disappeared in an instant. 



Short
Summary //This music video serves to invigorate
emotions and show a woman being unfaithful to a man, rather than visa versa.

There’s a main dancer, Tina
who wakes up next to her last night passion and leaves to walk home on the
cobble streets of Prague. On her walk home, she is surrounded by shadowed
figures that dance around her trying to bring her down one path or another. She
overtakes them with a dance of her own passions and then arrives at home
alone, hiding from her past mistakes.

The writers and singers on the bus will include James Robertson, Neal Ascherson, Billy Kay, David Greig, Karine Polwart and Mairi Campbell. Through the Bus Party's mix of celebration and conversation, they will be encouraging everyone to vote and asking, ""However you will vote, what kind of Scotland do you want?"" The artists on the bus will be exploring this question in music and song, poetry and readings that reflect Scotland's diversity.  Above all, the Bus Party will be listening to local communities from Wick to Wigtown, Stromness to Stirling, discussing the society they want to live in the day after the Referendum.If you long for this kind of civil conversation in the Referendum, your donation will make it happen in a matter of days, the length and breadth of Scotland!What We Need & What You GetThe Bus Party needs £7,000 to cover the cost of taking a minibus, car for the support team and a rotating group of artists from Stromness to Stirling between May 24 to May 31, holding 16 events over 8 days.

<p class=""MsoNormal"">As a newborn, it was only due to my lack of coordination
that I wasn't out of my bassinet tying little ribbons on the hair of the other

creating things until recently, when my house exploded into a full-blown art

<b><i><br/></i></b><p><b>The Story</b></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p>Hi, I’m Patricia A.
Montgomery, master artist. I am in collaboration with the African American
Museum &amp; Library at Oakland (AAMLO). Over the past year, I have been
creating a new series of work using African American quilting tradition, with
digital images and pastel drawings that tells the stories of African American
women involved in the Civil Rights Movement. To date we have raised $21,000 for
the installation of my exhibit, <i>“Heroines
of the Civil Rights Movement”, </i>but are short $4,000 to complete the
installation for the June 2015 exhibition. </p>
<p>The exhibition company of Gyroscope
and Gizmo is designing an unique environment consisting of the replication of a
1955 bus from Montgomery, Alabama. The exterior bus walls will be covered with
digital images of various Civil Rights events, marches, and women’s
organizations.  One of the unique aspects
of the exhibition is the quilted swing story coats representing the African
American heroines of the Civil Rights Movement. <span>The
second unique aspect is the idea expressed by AAMLO Chief Curator, Rick Moss. To
house the coats in an environment familiar to a majority of people puts the
inspirational designs in context. The viewer will have the opportunity
to stand next to, walk among, march along, and hear speeches from Fannie Lou
Hamer and Ella Josephine Baker. </span></p>
<p>This unique installation
honors these unsung heroines who were more than foot soldiers. They were
warriors who participated in the Montgomery bus boycott, the integration of schools
and colleges, sat at lunch counters and marched for voting rights. These social
nonviolent actions changed the world. </p>
<p>Please contribute to the <i>“Heroines of the Civil Rights Movement”</i>
and help us raise the $4,000 needed to complete and install an unique
environment for the unsung warriors’ swing story coats.</p>

<p></p>
<p>In 2010, Patricia A. Montgomery was acknowledged by the Alliance
for California Traditional Arts as a Master Artist for the 2011 Apprenticeship
Program. Over the years, she has created several mini-series story quilts with
digital images. One series was commissioned by the Asian &amp; Pacific Islander
American Health Forum (APIAHF) to create three textile memory quilts for their
25<sup>th</sup> Anniversary event in Washington titled <i>“A Journey Celebration: Honoring the Past – Living in the Present –
Moving towards the Future.”  </i>The
quilts were installed in their San Francisco Office.</p>
<p>The African American Museum and Library at Oakland is dedicated
to the discovery, preservation, interpretation and sharing of historical and
cultural experiences of African Americans in California and the West for
present and future generations.</p>
<p>Together we are creating an interactive installation to honor
the lives and stories of the African American women who participated in the
Civil Rights Movement.  Your contribution
to the <i>“Heroines of the Civil Rights
Movement”</i> campaign allows the viewer to learn about these warriors and
their contributions. Heroines like Dorothy Height who was known as the
Godmother of the Civil Rights, and Amelia Boynton Robinson who was a leader and
key figure in the 1965 march in Selma, Alabama that became known as <i>“Bloody Sunday” </i>will be showcased among
other heroines in the exhibit. The march
from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama led President Johnson to sign the Voting Rights
Act, which outlawed discrimination in voting. It’s important for this
generation to understand how these nonviolent actions changed the world.</p>

</div></div>","A special
fundraiser to raise $4000.00 for the collaborative project of master artist,
Patricia A. Montgomery and the African American Museum & Library at Oakland
(AMMLO) is in progress, to complete the installation of Patricia’s dramatic and
moving June 2015 exhibit “Heroines of the
Civil Rights Movement.”Various Design Phases of Heroines' Swing Coats 
The Story

Hi, I’m Patricia A.
Montgomery, master artist. I am in collaboration with the African American
Museum & Library at Oakland (AAMLO). Over the past year, I have been
creating a new series of work using African American quilting tradition, with
digital images and pastel drawings that tells the stories of African American
women involved in the Civil Rights Movement. To date we have raised $21,000 for
the installation of my exhibit, “Heroines
of the Civil Rights Movement”, but are short $4,000 to complete the
installation for the June 2015 exhibition. 
The exhibition company of Gyroscope
and Gizmo is designing an unique environment consisting of the replication of a
1955 bus from Montgomery, Alabama. The exterior bus walls will be covered with
digital images of various Civil Rights events, marches, and women’s
organizations.  One of the unique aspects
of the exhibition is the quilted swing story coats representing the African
American heroines of the Civil Rights Movement. The
second unique aspect is the idea expressed by AAMLO Chief Curator, Rick Moss. To
house the coats in an environment familiar to a majority of people puts the
inspirational designs in context. The viewer will have the opportunity
to stand next to, walk among, march along, and hear speeches from Fannie Lou
Hamer and Ella Josephine Baker. 
This unique installation
honors these unsung heroines who were more than foot soldiers. They were
warriors who participated in the Montgomery bus boycott, the integration of schools
and colleges, sat at lunch counters and marched for voting rights. These social
nonviolent actions changed the world. 
Please contribute to the “Heroines of the Civil Rights Movement”
and help us raise the $4,000 needed to complete and install an unique
environment for the unsung warriors’ swing story coats.

About Us & The Impact

In 2010, Patricia A. Montgomery was acknowledged by the Alliance
for California Traditional Arts as a Master Artist for the 2011 Apprenticeship
Program. Over the years, she has created several mini-series story quilts with
digital images. One series was commissioned by the Asian & Pacific Islander
American Health Forum (APIAHF) to create three textile memory quilts for their
25th Anniversary event in Washington titled “A Journey Celebration: Honoring the Past – Living in the Present –
Moving towards the Future.”  The
quilts were installed in their San Francisco Office.
The African American Museum and Library at Oakland is dedicated
to the discovery, preservation, interpretation and sharing of historical and
cultural experiences of African Americans in California and the West for
present and future generations.
Together we are creating an interactive installation to honor
the lives and stories of the African American women who participated in the
Civil Rights Movement.  Your contribution
to the “Heroines of the Civil Rights
Movement” campaign allows the viewer to learn about these warriors and
their contributions. Heroines like Dorothy Height who was known as the
Godmother of the Civil Rights, and Amelia Boynton Robinson who was a leader and
key figure in the 1965 march in Selma, Alabama that became known as “Bloody Sunday” will be showcased among
other heroines in the exhibit. The march
from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama led President Johnson to sign the Voting Rights
Act, which outlawed discrimination in voting. It’s important for this
generation to understand how these nonviolent actions changed the world.

</div></div>","Plein Air 365x5:   2014 DAYS, 5+ YEARS, 1 ARTIST’S JOURNEY…
This is the World's Largest One-man Plein Air Art Show and a first of its kind. 


Plein Air 365 x 5, an exhibition and sale of the 2,014
paintings created by pleinair painter, Ted Garcia, during his
five-year journey of painting daily from January 1, 2009 thru July 11, 2014.In January 2009, Ted Garcia challenged himself to paint plein
air every day. For five years (2,014 days exactly), he continued his daily
commitment facing the challenges with discipline
and perseverance which come
with a commitment of this magnitude, along with blizzards, heat waves,
illness, deaths, births, impalement, wild animals, and even losing
his way, finding his way, and surviving an earthquake to complete
this journey.







Seeing all 2100 plus paintings hanging in our new gallery space is more amazing then we could have imagined, and the opening reception was great! We were excited and inspired by all the positive comments and feedback. Please help keep the positive momentum going and donate today! Only through our Indiegogo Campaign can you get a limited edition, signed print of our highly popular Colorado Columbine or even an original commissioned painting. What a great Christmas present for someone special! Please share with family and friends and be a part of history!
This Week's Featured Wall:""Eats and Treats""


Stay tuned for next week's featured paintings!



The visual diary of this journey needs to be seen.


Why? Because it is an inspiration to all who dream! 

It shows that if you are willing to do what it takes, your
dream can come true.

By helping Ted show this journey to the world – he will
show others what can be done – with a dream, discipline and perseverance.

It is a story that needs to be shared, with spectacular art that needs to seen.


With your financial support – Ted and his team can do just that.
        

Who is Ted Garcia?
Ted Garcia
has been a successful Evergreen, Colorado plein air artist for over 12 years
and has sold many paintings to collectors. Holding to a true plein air painting
philosophy, all of Ted’s plein air paintings are painted on location and are
completed in one setting, as he works to capture each scene before changes in
the light and atmosphere occur.

   The Money it Takes to Put on the Show
 

This visual diary will be a sight to
see!
After searching over a year for an
affordable gallery large enough to showcase all 2,014 paintings, he has finally
found the perfect space. The contract is signed and the date is set! But (eek!) the rent alone is $11,600! 
The location and the availability of the space at this time of year is exciting. Aspen Grove Lifestyle Center is an upscale shopping destination – with at least 4,000 visitors per week day and 6,000 on the weekends.  During the holidays those numbers will double, even triple.  This opens ups the opportunity for many visitors to the gallery; many opportunities for sales.   The gallery is large enough to show all 2,014 paintings – Ted is building the system to hang the paintings in chronological order; and they are priced for collecting and gift giving.  It could just be the perfect storm – location, time of year, number of shoppers to find many of the paintings a home. 
There is also a need for money
to successfully produce and promote the event. Funds are needed for the
following:



Advertising and marketing including mailers, signage, ads, promotions


Business support – insurance, licenses


Artists Reception to celebrate

<p><b>The Book and What It Means to Me:</b></p>
<p>My name is <a href=""http://www.robinbernat.com/wp/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Robin Bernat</a> and I have been writing poems since I was a child. Beginning in 1997, I have self-published three previous volumes, <i>waiting: eleven poems of love and anticipation</i> (1997), <i>blue: twenty love poems and a song of despair </i>(1999), and <i>Sentimental: poems and short stories </i>(2007). Those editions have been carried at a few local bookstores in Atlanta including the Emory University bookstore, and also several museum shops around the country. They are also for sale at Whitespace gallery and Poem 88.</p>
<p><i>Saudade</i> is a collection of love poems some in sonnet form, others in quatrains. The title of the volume is a Portuguese word meaning <i>a feeling of longing, melancholy, or nostalgia that is supposedly characteristic of the Portuguese or Brazilian temperament. </i>Many of the poems touch on classical themes: love and loss, memory and anticipation. Influenced primarily by the  confessional poets, the poems draw on my own life experiences of requited and unrequited love, the sudden death of my partner in December 2000, and how that conjured memories of my father’s death in 1979. On a lighter note, there are poems written for my two cats and happier poems written for my husband, Jon. </p>
<p>My work, written and visual, was once aptly described by a colleague [where ideas of classical beauty co-mingle with their dark cousins].</p>
<p>
</p><p><i>Saudade</i> combines poetry with lush, arresting images to create something of a cross-breed between the traditional chapbook and an artist book.  The books are small enough to fit in a coat pocket for easy contemplation.</p>
<p><b>Biography:</b></p>
<p><a href=""http://www.robinbernat.com/wp/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Robin Bernat</a> is foremost an artist and writer and secondarily the owner and curator of <a href=""http://www.poem88.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Poem 88</a> gallery in Atlanta, Georgia. Her work has been exhibited locally, regionally and nationally and has been collected by many important institutions including The Whitney Museum of American Art, The Kemper Museum of Art, The High Musuem of Art, MOCA-GA and The Weatherspoon Museum. Working primarily in film and video, Bernat's work explores the fleeting and the provisional. </p>
<p>Besides her self-published volumes, she has published monographs under the imprimatur of Circle B Press for artists Rick Berman and Susan Seydel Cofer and published a collection of images, Pictures Take You Places (2014) by Phillip March Jones under the imprimatur Poem 88 EDITIONS. She has also been a contributor to <i>Art Papers Magazine</i> and <i>Burnaway</i>.</p>
<p>Through Poem 88, Bernat brings to the fore the work of significant and emerging artists in Atlanta and the Southeast many of whom were former classmates. She is a graduate of The University of Georgia and The Atlanta College of Art; in 2001, she was a Visiting Artist at the American Academy in Rome.</p>
<p><b>Where I am with the book:</b></p>
<p>All of the poems have been written and the book has been designed by me with assistance from my husband. All that is left is to raise the $1450 to digitally print and bind the book.

</p><p><b>My name is Ashley
Jane Laird </b><br/></p><p>After graduating from Washburn University with a Bachelor of
Fine Arts in 2011, I have focused on developing my skills as a facilitator and
designer of community-based murals. I have worked on numerous public projects across
the country, including: Joplin, Missouri; Arkadelphia, Arkansas; Waco, Texas; Queens,
New York; Sioux Falls, South Dakota; Songdo, South Korea and five murals in here
Topeka. I also have led women and children in collaborative projects for
Survivor Art Night at the Topeka YWCA Center for Safety and Empowerment for
which I was honored with a 2012 Arts Advocate Award. </p>
<p>For me, this work is the most fulfilling and meaningful work
I have ever done. The stories we tell are often ones that
are over looked. These projects give us a chance to reclaim public space to
share, remember and celebrate these important aspects of our culture.<span>  In the end, it feels like a real
accomplishment and gives me a renewed sense of hope. </span></p>
<br/><p><b>The Kansas Women’s
Mural</b></p>
<p>In conjunction with the Great Mural Wall of Topeka (the soon
to be longest mural in the state at 900’ feet), I will be leading a
community-based process that culminates in a 12’ x 70’ foot mural panel that honors the history, accomplishments and continued
spirit of Kansas Women. The project will involve Topeka citizens
directly in the research, design and painting of the
mural. Beginning with workshops in April, a volunteer

<br/><p></p></div>","My name is Ashley
Jane Laird After graduating from Washburn University with a Bachelor of
Fine Arts in 2011, I have focused on developing my skills as a facilitator and
designer of community-based murals. I have worked on numerous public projects across
the country, including: Joplin, Missouri; Arkadelphia, Arkansas; Waco, Texas; Queens,
New York; Sioux Falls, South Dakota; Songdo, South Korea and five murals in here
Topeka. I also have led women and children in collaborative projects for
Survivor Art Night at the Topeka YWCA Center for Safety and Empowerment for
which I was honored with a 2012 Arts Advocate Award. 
For me, this work is the most fulfilling and meaningful work
I have ever done. The stories we tell are often ones that
are over looked. These projects give us a chance to reclaim public space to
share, remember and celebrate these important aspects of our culture.  In the end, it feels like a real
accomplishment and gives me a renewed sense of hope. 
The Kansas Women’s
Mural
In conjunction with the Great Mural Wall of Topeka (the soon
to be longest mural in the state at 900’ feet), I will be leading a
community-based process that culminates in a 12’ x 70’ foot mural panel that honors the history, accomplishments and continued
spirit of Kansas Women. The project will involve Topeka citizens
directly in the research, design and painting of the
mural. Beginning with workshops in April, a volunteer
mural team will learn about the techniques and traditions of mural painting as
well as the work and lives of significant Kansas muralists. The team will
create and gather raw material for the mural from sources including local
libraries, museums, interviews, community meetings and drawing workshops. The
finished design will be painted collaboratively by the design team and any
interested passersby. We will celebrate completion of the first ever Kansas
Women’s mural in June with a formal dedication and great street party.

sometimes forget to dream big and follow what is in their heart due to
pressures from others’ expectations. The current instability of the American
Dream adds to the need to discover each individual’s true dream. For women and
minorities, the “Traditional American Dream” was never a reality; now is the
time to Empower Your Dreams that are already in your heart. </p>

<p>My name is Clayton Windatt, I work at the White Water Gallery Artist-Run Centre and I would like to introduce you to our Youth Arts Initiative.</p>
<p>Over the past few years a group of young emerging artists have grown from doing little things here and there to a group of youth focusing on professional development and outreach activities on a huge scale. The Youth Arts Initiative or YAI focuses on collaborative community projects and work together to make the world a better place. They also work to better themselves by bringing in professional artists for workshops, artist-talks and help give them the skills needed to succeed in life. This is the third year that the program has been in place but the first year that we have started seeking funds to run our program.</p>
<p>Up until now the program has been running as volunteer-only with small funds being raised by youth to cover supplies and workshop costs.  Our campaign is raising money to fund the core aspects of the YAI program and increase its capacity dramatically. This means that it will pay for space, supplies and employment to run the program year-round bringing the program to new heights. Our goal of $25,000 will create a new employment situation giving the youth group a coordinator to help run the program and create 12 new professional development workshops, artist talks and seminars that will be provided on-site and online on our website.</p>
<p>This is a big deal to us as it helps the existing youth have better opportunities for success in life but also will encourage and engage additional interest from new emerging artists in our region and abroad.</p>
<p>We have created a series of unique perks as incentives to donate to our campaign. These range from personalized postcards signed by all of our youth participants to Awards of Honour that will be given out at a big award ceremony later in the year.</p>
<p>The success of this project is the success of creativity in our community as this is our new generation of artists. Our community needs artistic growth of this kind and this funding will make life in our region a more beautiful, vibrant and a wonderful experience for everyone!</p>
<p>Get involved and spread the word! Like us out on Facebook and share our message of celebration and community through youth engagement in the arts! We are making change happen in our community, get out there and make things better for yours!</p></div>","Hello INDIEGOGO

<h2>Help Me Spread my Tentacles</h2>

Noadi's Art is traveling and needs your help. I want to bring my octopus necklaces, tentacle earrings, and Cthulhu art all over New England this Fall.<br/><br/>This fall I'm exhibiting at three Comic Cons in three different states. It is a big step, before I've been limited to events in western and southern Maine but I'm busting out of my local comfort zone. <br/><br/>First up will still be in my home state but on the far opposite side at BangPop! Comic Con in Bangor, Maine, September 20-21. Then October 25-26 at Vermont Comic Con in Burlington. Finally I will be traveling to the farthest (and to the biggest) of the three: Rhode Island Comic Con November 1-2 in Providence.<br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/745409/files/20140726111357-indiegogo.jpg?1406398437"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>Who am I?</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Noadi's Art is just me, Sheryl Westleigh. Everything I sell is my own creation, every necklace, every earring, every sculpture I've made with my own hands. I do have prints of my 2 dimensional work printed for me but that's the only exception.</p>
<p>I started sculpting as a hobby in 2005, creating small 
sculptures and jewelry for friends and family. In 2008 I started 
Noadi’s Art as a part-time business and by early 2010 Noadi’s Art was my full-time job. Through my online store I've sold to all 50 states and over 20 countries.</p>
<p>I create jewelry from polymer clay, resin, and even actual petri dishes. Everything from steampunk cuttlefish, to deep space squid, tentacles, Lovecraftian horrors, and really anything that is a little weird and creepy. <br/></p>

<p>Dem Team des Kiezladens Blank ist besonders
eines wichtig: <span>ein
bewussteres Konsumverhalten anzustoßen. Deswegen verkaufen wir, passend
zu unserem Namen, „nackte“ (also unverpackte) Ware. Wie das funktioniert? Ihr
bringt eure eigenen Verpackungen (Tupperdosen, Schraubgläser, Flaschen oder
Beutel) mit oder leiht sie bei uns aus – und ihr füllt die gewünschte Menge des
jeweiligen Produktes ab. Das ist nämlich auch so ein Vorteil, den unser Konzept
mit sich bringt: Ihr kauft genau die Menge, die ihr braucht. So landen weniger
Lebensmittel auf dem Müll. Und ihr spart Geld. Selbstredend ist unsere Ware
komplett biologisch, regional und vegan oder vegetarisch. Außerdem bieten wir
saisonales Obst und Gemüse an, das nicht der EU-Norm entspricht – und normaler-
und unsinnigerweise im Abfall der Bauern landen oder verfüttert werden würden.
Unser leckeres Bio-Essen To-Go soll euch dabei helfen, dass auch auch in einem
stressigen Arbeitsalltag gesunde Ernährung ihren Platz findet. Mit diesem
Konzept möchten wir dazu beitragen, ein wenig mehr Bewusstsein in den eigenen
Konsum zu integrieren – denn ökologisch verantwortungsvoller zu leben ist gar
nicht zu aufwändig, wie es zuerst scheinen mag. Zudem möchten wir mit unserem
Kiezladen Blank ein Treffpunkt für Menschen sein, die Wert auf bewussten Genuss
legen und gerne die Menschen aus ihrem Kiez näher kennenlernen wollen. Unser
Café- und Kuchenangebot laden nach dem Einkauf zum Verweilen ein. Und wir
freuen uns, euch kennenzulernen und gemeinsam eine neue Bewegung anzustoßen. <br/></span></p><p><span></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/538999/files/20140428024653-blank_ladenfront.jpg?1398678413"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h4><i>Was sind die Ziele und wer die Zielgruppe? </i></h4><h3>
</h3><p>Wir setzen uns mit Herzblut für ein
bewussteres Konsumverhalten ein. Denn wir finden, dass man unnötigen
Plastikmüll vermeiden kann – und zwar in der gesamten Lieferkette. Deswegen
arbeiten wir auch mit ausgewählten Bio-Höfen Berlins und Brandenburgs zusammen
und sorgen dafür, dass bei keinem Schritt der Lieferkette sinnlose
Verpackungsmaterialien verwendet werden. Außerdem sorgen wir so für mehr
Transparenz für unsere Kunden: Wir wissen genau, woher unsere Produkte stammen
– und können so Vertrauen schaffen.</p>
In unserem Kiezladen Blank freuen wir uns über
offene, aufgeschlossene und genussvolle Menschen, die bewusst leben und
konsumieren möchten. Menschen unterschiedlichsten Alters, die an ihrem
ökologischen Fußabdruck arbeiten wollen und bereits erkannt haben, dass ein
wesentlicher Schlüssel für Veränderung reflektiertes Konsumverhalten ist. Aber
die vielleicht im Alltag nicht die Zeit dafür finden, sich mit diesem Thema so
konsequent, wie sie es möchten, auseinanderzusetzen. Deshalb möchten wir euch
den Schritt zu diesem Ansatz so einfach wie möglich gestalten. Zudem freuen wir
uns über ein Kiez-nachbarschaftliches Miteinander. Denn wir legen Wert auf einen persönlichen Austausch mit unseren
Lieferanten und Gästen. <br/><br/><span></span>
<h4><i>Warum
sollte man dieses Projekt unterstützen?</i></h4>
<p>Dieses Problem kennt jeder: Wir alle
produzieren einfach zu viel Müll. Und alle zahlen dabei auch noch drauf. Dabei
sind viele Verpackungen einfach unnötig – seien es Milchtüten, Shampoo-Flaschen
oder Nudeln in Plastik. Doch spielen hier nicht nur ökologische Aspekte eine
Rolle – sondern auch die Zeit, die für Ein- und Auspacken und Recyclen bzw
Entsorgen vertan wird. </p>
<p>Außerdem werden viele Produkte ausschließlich
in normierten Größen angeboten, die oft nicht der Lebensrealität (zum Beispiel
von Singles, Pendlern oder auch Großfamilien) entsprechen. Das ist ein weiterer
Punkt, der unsere Müllberge anwachsen lässt. Wir denken: Das muss nicht sein. <br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/539258/files/20140428051546-start_inidegogo-01.jpg?1398687346"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><h4><i>Was passiert mit dem Geld bei
erfolgreicher Finanzierung?</i></h4><p>
</p><p>Wenn wir 30.000 Euro zusammen bekommen haben,
möchten wir ein Ladenlokal in Berlin anmieten. Da
wir unsere Ware ja blank, also unverpackt, anbieten, brauchen wir Gefäße, in
die die einzelnen Produkte nach Anlieferung durch ihren Erzeuger abgefüllt
werden. Das werden zum Beispiel Gravity Bins (Bulk Bins), Holzkisten für Gemüse
oder Theken mit einzelnen Schüttgut-Gefäßen sein. Außerdem müssen wir die
Gefäße, die wir unseren Kunden ausleihen, noch anschaffen – zum Beispiel
verschließbare Glasflaschen, Schraubgläser und Ähnliches … Dazu kommen
Kühlmöbel, eine Kaffeemaschine und weiteres typisches Equipment, das für einen
laufenden Café- und Ladenbetrieb benötigt wird. Unser Ladenlokal soll mit Holz reduziert
und gemütlich ausgebaut werden. Und sich so zu einem Ort entwickeln, in dem ihr
als Kunden gerne zurückkehrt – sei es für einen Einkauf, einen Kaffee oder auch
einen netten Plausch unter Kiez-Nachbarn. </p><h4><i>Wie ihr uns sonst noch helfen könnt...<br/></i></h4>Neben finanzieller freuen wir uns
auch über eure tatkäftige Unterstützung. Schließlich wollen wir unser
Ladenlokal von der Pike auf selber gestalten. Falls also jemand von euch
handwerklich begabt ist und Lust hat, uns ein wenig zu helfen, würden wir uns
natürlich sehr freuen. Außerdem benötigen wir noch jegliche
Einrichtungsgegenstände – von Möbeln über Kühlschränke bis hin zu Regalen oder
einer Kaffeemaschine. Vielleicht hat ja der ein oder andere einen gewissen
Lagerbestand … ;)<br/>Und schaut euch unbedingt unsere tollen Dankeschöns an!<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/539122/files/20140428043115-dankescho_ns-02.jpg?1398684675"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h4><i>Warum Crowdfunding – warum Indiegogo?<br/></i></h4>Wir möchten mit kleinen Schritten versuchen,
etwas mehr Bewusstsein und Transparenz in unser Konsumverhalten zu bringen.
Doch damit wir anfangen können, brauchen wir Starthilfe: Dafür bietet sich
unserer Meinung nach das Netzwerk von Indiegogo besonders gut an – so eine
Reichweite würden wir alleine nicht unbedingt erreichen. Außerdem beinhaltet
diese Finanzierungsmöglichkeit wenig Risiko für junge Unternehmer wie uns. 
<br/><br/><h4><i>Wer steht hinter dem Projekt?</i></h4>
<p><i></i></p><p><i>Mein Name ist Franka, ich komme aus Berlin und
arbeite seit mehreren Jahren in der Werbebranche und bin dadurch fast täglich
mit Verpackungen und allem, was sich um Produkte herum abspielt, beschäftigt.
Meiner Meinung nach werden viel zu viele Ressourcen auf das „Drumherum“
verschwendet, anstatt sich mit dem eigentlichen Produkt auseinanderzusetzen.
Deshalb möchte ich einen Kiezladen eröffnen, der Lebensmittel ausschließlich
unverpackt anbietet. </i></p><p></p><p><i></i></p><p><i><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/539037/files/20140428031825-_MG_1760.jpg?1398680305"" src="""" style=""""/></i></p><i>Alleine ist so ein Projekt natürlich nicht zu

That's why we sell exactly what it says on the tin: blank, naked and unpackaged, products. How does that work? You just bring your own packaging (tupperware, screw-top jars, bottles or baggies) or you can lend one of our vessels  and then you fill it with exactly the desired amount of product. That's another one of the advantages of our<br/>concept: you only buy as much as you need. This way, less groceries are wasted, while you save money. Our products are, of course, 100% organic, local and vegan or vegetarian. Additionally, we offer seasonal fruits and vegetables that don't conform to EU-standards and would otherwise be thrown away or fed to livestock, although perfectly edible. Our delicious organic take-out helps you to follow a healthy diet during the busy work week. We want our own consumption to be more aware  living environmentally responsible is not as complicated as it may seem. Additionally, we want our store to be a<br/>meeting point for people from the neighborhood who share a passion for good food without a side of guilt. Our food and bakery items entice to hang around for a while. And we are looking forward to meeting you and toasting to a new movement with you.</p><h4>What are the goals and the target audience? </h4><p>We want a more conscious kind of consumer behavior  and we are giving<br/>this cause our blood, sweat and tears. Because we believe unnecessary plastic waste can be avoided  throughout the entire supply chain. That's why we work with hand-picked organic farms in Berlin and Brandenburg and make sure that no unnecessary packaging material is used during any step of the way. This way, we also offer more transparency. We know exactly where our products come from  and our customers can trust us on that.</p><p>We are excited to meet open-minded food aficionados at Blank. People of all ages who want to live a sensible lifestyle. Who want to reduce their carbon footprint and who have realized that if we want change, we must start with our own consumer behavior. People who may not find the time in their busy lives to handle this issue as consistently as they would like to. We are here to make it easier for you. And we are looking forward to a neighborly atmosphere at our store. We appreciate friendly communication, both with our customers and our<br/>suppliers</p><h4>Why should you support this project?</h4><p>We all know the issue: We just produce too much waste. And we pay for it dearly, even though so much packaging is simply not necessary  be it milk cartons, shampoo bottles or pasta wrapped in plastic. It's not even just an environmental issue  there is also the time wasted on packaging, unwrapping, recycling or disposal to be considered. Additionally, many products can only be bought in standardized sizes, which often don't match the customer's reality (like single-person households, commuters or large families). This is another factor contributing to growing waste mountains. We think it doesn't have to be this way.</p><h4>What will be done with the money?</h4><p>If we source  30.000, we want to rent a store in Neukölln, Kreuzberg<br/>or Schöneberg. Since we will sell our products blank, unpackaged, we need vessels to store them once we have received them from our suppliers. These will be gravity bins, wooden boxes for vegetables or counters with bulk bins. We will also need vessels that we can lend our customers, such as screw-top jars, glass bottles and the likes. Plus refrigeration equipment, a coffee machine and all the typical equipment needed for running a hospitality business. Our store will be furnished cozily and functionally with wood, so it can develop into a place that invites customers to come back  for grocery shopping, a cup of coffee or just a nice chat with the neighbors.</p><h4>Other Ways You Can Help </h4><p>Aside from financial aid we would be delighted about some manual help. We<br/>are trying to built our own business from scratch, after all. So if any of you are crafty, skilled or talented in a trade and don't mind getting your hands dirty, we would love it if you came by. We also need all kinds of equipment and furbishing  furniture, refrigerators, cupboards, a coffee machine and everything else. Maybe some of you have those things just lying around ... ;) And have a look we have lovely ThankYou's.</p><h4>Why crowdfunding  why Indiegogo?</h4><p>We want to take all the little steps needed to implement a little more awareness and transparency into our consumer behavior. But in order to get going with that, we're going to need help: We believe that Indiegogo is a great platform for that. We wouldn't be able to reach that far on our own. Crowdfunding also poses few risks for young entrepreneurs like us.</p><h4>Who is behind this project?</h4><p><i>My name is Franka, I'm from Berlin and have been working in advertising<br/>for several years. That's where I deal with packaging and all things surrounding products that aren't the actual product almost daily. If you ask me, too many resources are wasted on what the product is wrapped in, rather than working on the product itself. That's why I want to open a neighborhood spot where groceries are sold unwrapped. But I am just one girl, and I could never bring this project to life on my own and it wouldn't be nearly as much fun, either. So this is<br/>where I introduce my fantastic team to you, the people who help me with this idea that I love so much  and who continue to inspire me every day:</i></p><p><i>Philipp - sparring partner and interior construction<br/><br/>Kristina - graphic design, illustration<br/><br/>Heike - film, cut, photography<br/><br/>Sonja - social media consulting<br/><br/>Kathrin - text &amp; public relations<br/><br/>Stella, Christoph, Bartholomäus, Lena, Kristina  - statements<br/><br/>Mama, Papa &amp; Oskar -  mental support</i><br/><br/><i>Thank you all so much &lt;3</i><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p><br/><br/><br/></p><p></p><p></p><p></p></div>","Aus aktuellem Anlass:Leider funktioniert die Kreditkartenüberweisung ohne Paypal nicht zuverlässig.

You just bring your own packaging (tupperware, screw-top jars, bottles or baggies) or you can lend one of our vessels  and then you fill it with exactly the desired amount of product. That's another one of the advantages of ourconcept: you only buy as much as you need. This way, less groceries are wasted, while you save money. Our products are, of course, 100% organic, local and vegan or vegetarian. Additionally, we offer seasonal fruits and vegetables that don't conform to EU-standards and would otherwise be thrown away or fed to livestock, although perfectly edible. Our delicious organic take-out helps you to follow a healthy diet during the busy work week. We want our own consumption to be more aware  living environmentally responsible is not as complicated as it may seem. Additionally, we want our store to be ameeting point for people from the neighborhood who share a passion for good food without a side of guilt. Our food and bakery items entice to hang around for a while. And we are looking forward to meeting you and toasting to a new movement with you.What are the goals and the target audience? We want a more conscious kind of consumer behavior  and we are givingthis cause our blood, sweat and tears. Because we believe unnecessary plastic waste can be avoided  throughout the entire supply chain. That's why we work with hand-picked organic farms in Berlin and Brandenburg and make sure that no unnecessary packaging material is used during any step of the way. This way, we also offer more transparency. We know exactly where our products come from  and our customers can trust us on that.We are excited to meet open-minded food aficionados at Blank. People of all ages who want to live a sensible lifestyle. Who want to reduce their carbon footprint and who have realized that if we want change, we must start with our own consumer behavior. People who may not find the time in their busy lives to handle this issue as consistently as they would like to. We are here to make it easier for you. And we are looking forward to a neighborly atmosphere at our store. We appreciate friendly communication, both with our customers and oursuppliersWhy should you support this project?We all know the issue: We just produce too much waste. And we pay for it dearly, even though so much packaging is simply not necessary  be it milk cartons, shampoo bottles or pasta wrapped in plastic. It's not even just an environmental issue  there is also the time wasted on packaging, unwrapping, recycling or disposal to be considered. Additionally, many products can only be bought in standardized sizes, which often don't match the customer's reality (like single-person households, commuters or large families). This is another factor contributing to growing waste mountains. We think it doesn't have to be this way.What will be done with the money?If we source  30.000, we want to rent a store in Neukölln, Kreuzbergor Schöneberg. Since we will sell our products blank, unpackaged, we need vessels to store them once we have received them from our suppliers. These will be gravity bins, wooden boxes for vegetables or counters with bulk bins. We will also need vessels that we can lend our customers, such as screw-top jars, glass bottles and the likes. Plus refrigeration equipment, a coffee machine and all the typical equipment needed for running a hospitality business. Our store will be furnished cozily and functionally with wood, so it can develop into a place that invites customers to come back  for grocery shopping, a cup of coffee or just a nice chat with the neighbors.Other Ways You Can Help Aside from financial aid we would be delighted about some manual help. Weare trying to built our own business from scratch, after all. So if any of you are crafty, skilled or talented in a trade and don't mind getting your hands dirty, we would love it if you came by. We also need all kinds of equipment and furbishing  furniture, refrigerators, cupboards, a coffee machine and everything else. Maybe some of you have those things just lying around ... ;) And have a look we have lovely ThankYou's.Why crowdfunding  why Indiegogo?We want to take all the little steps needed to implement a little more awareness and transparency into our consumer behavior. But in order to get going with that, we're going to need help: We believe that Indiegogo is a great platform for that. We wouldn't be able to reach that far on our own. Crowdfunding also poses few risks for young entrepreneurs like us.Who is behind this project?My name is Franka, I'm from Berlin and have been working in advertisingfor several years. That's where I deal with packaging and all things surrounding products that aren't the actual product almost daily. If you ask me, too many resources are wasted on what the product is wrapped in, rather than working on the product itself. That's why I want to open a neighborhood spot where groceries are sold unwrapped. But I am just one girl, and I could never bring this project to life on my own and it wouldn't be nearly as much fun, either. So this iswhere I introduce my fantastic team to you, the people who help me with this idea that I love so much  and who continue to inspire me every day:Philipp - sparring partner and interior constructionKristina - graphic design, illustrationHeike - film, cut, photographySonja - social media consultingKathrin - text & public relationsStella, Christoph, Bartholomäus, Lena, Kristina  - statementsMama, Papa & Oskar -  mental supportThank you all so much <3",8.0,0,"1 Campaign

What does a business structure look like when it's founded on pleasure and abundance? We believe the feminine energy is accessible and exists in all beings, regardless of gender, and our mission seeks to help creatures of all identities find the feminine within their own bodies; grace, beauty, creativity, nourishment, and divine love.</p><p><strong>WHAT IS BODY PARADISE?</strong></p><p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>Imagine walking on the busy streets of MLK to find yourself magnetically drawn to the beauty and serenity of a mini-shop, full of creations made by local artists and makers.</span><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'> Indigo's handmade creations lay in a sea of pink, and every dollar spent here fills up the pockets and hearts of worthy artisans. With a focus on</span><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'> sustainable fashion, wellness, and beauty products, all of the items in the shop are curated to compliment the healing offerings that happen in our temple. We hope to bring awareness to money as a circular energy--what you spend in this space, is a donation to your very own heart. If it isn't obvious, we are passionate about the earth, and our business functions as a low to zero waste operation!</span></p><p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>Perhaps you stopped in for a magical astrology reading with Julia where you'll touch down into the blueprint of your path here on earth, or a one-on-one sex and intimacy coaching session with Indigo. Maybe you're here for a Kundalini class or group workshop on self-pleasure, or vision plant journeys, or moon worship. Maybe you've simply stumbled in and found yourself in our web of dreams! Whoever you are, during the open worship hours of our sanctuary, we'll invite you to take your shoes off, sit on a pillow, stare at the altar, and replenish. Rest. Relax. How often is it that we are able to deeply integrate consumerism with what we believe it's true purpose should be; to give to ourselves our heart's desire, so that we can give freely to our community?! Our altar is in worship to our business deva we call ""The Big Lady"" aka the earth; this life giving planet that supplies us with all resources, and all opportunities for growth and expansion of consciousness. You'll be invited to add to the altar, and worship, whenever the shop is open, whenever you book a session with one of us, or attend a workshop or class! </span></p><p><font><b>OFFERINGS AND OUR WORK</b></font></p><p><font>Both of our work centers around creativity, playfulness, and storytelling. We are both artists and healers, and recognize that to heal is an act of creative artistry, and that to create art is an act of healing the self. We combine these modalities in all that we do, which is why Body Paradise and is deemed a ""playground for your higher self!"" Since this space is in worship to the divine feminine,  we have energetically set the space to hold a nourishing and nurturing container so that throughout our session work, workshops, and community gatherings we all collectively let out our inner kids to play, explore, and splash about into the depths of our own creative potential. </font></p><p><strong>WHERE IS IT LOCATED (AND WHY!?)</strong></p><p>Body Paradise will be located in SE Portland on MLK. The space has been functioning as Julia's private studio, and is in full renovations to accommodate both our practices and support our creative dreams. We picked the location of this chaotically busy street-corner to be a glorious representation of what it is we hope to do with our work; many healing philosophies pump people full of love and light, but neglect to spread that beauty to the parts of the world and parts of the self that aren't as ""pretty"" or ""acceptable"". We hope that the presence of this space will in a subtle way (a feminine way!) help break down the conventions of what beauty means, who is allowed access to it, and how we can embrace the sounds of traffic and the trash outside our door as an equally divine part of what it means to be human, sending them love and acceptance rather than compartmentalization or rejection.  The dichotomy between this sanctuary of pleasure and beauty and the reality of the hustle, bustle and action of the streets is the polarity we are working with--how can we bring more love to the harshness? Compassion for the trauma? Use creativity to approach our triggers?

What does a business structure look like when it's founded on pleasure and abundance? We believe the feminine energy is accessible and exists in all beings, regardless of gender, and our mission seeks to help creatures of all identities find the feminine within their own bodies; grace, beauty, creativity, nourishment, and divine love.WHAT IS BODY PARADISE?Imagine walking on the busy streets of MLK to find yourself magnetically drawn to the beauty and serenity of a mini-shop, full of creations made by local artists and makers. Indigo's handmade creations lay in a sea of pink, and every dollar spent here fills up the pockets and hearts of worthy artisans. With a focus on sustainable fashion, wellness, and beauty products, all of the items in the shop are curated to compliment the healing offerings that happen in our temple. We hope to bring awareness to money as a circular energy--what you spend in this space, is a donation to your very own heart. If it isn't obvious, we are passionate about the earth, and our business functions as a low to zero waste operation!Perhaps you stopped in for a magical astrology reading with Julia where you'll touch down into the blueprint of your path here on earth, or a one-on-one sex and intimacy coaching session with Indigo. Maybe you're here for a Kundalini class or group workshop on self-pleasure, or vision plant journeys, or moon worship. Maybe you've simply stumbled in and found yourself in our web of dreams! Whoever you are, during the open worship hours of our sanctuary, we'll invite you to take your shoes off, sit on a pillow, stare at the altar, and replenish. Rest. Relax. How often is it that we are able to deeply integrate consumerism with what we believe it's true purpose should be; to give to ourselves our heart's desire, so that we can give freely to our community?! Our altar is in worship to our business deva we call ""The Big Lady"" aka the earth; this life giving planet that supplies us with all resources, and all opportunities for growth and expansion of consciousness. You'll be invited to add to the altar, and worship, whenever the shop is open, whenever you book a session with one of us, or attend a workshop or class! OFFERINGS AND OUR WORKBoth of our work centers around creativity, playfulness, and storytelling. We are both artists and healers, and recognize that to heal is an act of creative artistry, and that to create art is an act of healing the self. We combine these modalities in all that we do, which is why Body Paradise and is deemed a ""playground for your higher self!"" Since this space is in worship to the divine feminine,  we have energetically set the space to hold a nourishing and nurturing container so that throughout our session work, workshops, and community gatherings we all collectively let out our inner kids to play, explore, and splash about into the depths of our own creative potential. WHERE IS IT LOCATED (AND WHY!?)Body Paradise will be located in SE Portland on MLK. The space has been functioning as Julia's private studio, and is in full renovations to accommodate both our practices and support our creative dreams. We picked the location of this chaotically busy street-corner to be a glorious representation of what it is we hope to do with our work; many healing philosophies pump people full of love and light, but neglect to spread that beauty to the parts of the world and parts of the self that aren't as ""pretty"" or ""acceptable"". We hope that the presence of this space will in a subtle way (a feminine way!) help break down the conventions of what beauty means, who is allowed access to it, and how we can embrace the sounds of traffic and the trash outside our door as an equally divine part of what it means to be human, sending them love and acceptance rather than compartmentalization or rejection.  The dichotomy between this sanctuary of pleasure and beauty and the reality of the hustle, bustle and action of the streets is the polarity we are working with--how can we bring more love to the harshness? Compassion for the trauma? Use creativity to approach our triggers? With this space we declare that our worship of the earth and her ever persistent wildly feminine energy seep outward into the structures of the world that need it most; starting with our little street-corner. WHAT DO WE NEED FROM OUR LOVED ONES?We are ecstatic to begin offering these gifts to the community and are very close to making it happen!

<p>Los venezolanos amamos nuestro país y nuestra cultura, muchos de nosotros estamos dispuestos a superar las dificultades y seguir adelante creyendo en que una mejor Venezuela es posible, una Venezuela que supera las dificultades y le demuestra al mundo que tenemos las herramientas para lograrlo.</p>
<p>C4 Trio representa eso, el crecimiento en medio de la dificultad y las ganas de hacer las cosas bien para construir una mejor Venezuela.</p>
<p>C4 Trío es una agrupación que ha posicionado la música venezolana en otro nivel, teniendo como protagonista uno de los mayores íconos de la cultura venezolana: el Cuatro. Ha motivado elogios de músicos muy importantes alrededor del mundo, llevando la sonoridad del cuatro a niveles insospechados, recogiendo su historia sonora y proyectándola a un futuro maravilloso, que evoluciona y que nos asegura la eternidad de nuestra cultura musical. Se han convertido en un ejemplo tangible y necesario para cualquier joven de hoy, para cada ciudadano venezolano que ame su tierra y su cultura. Un estímulo y una inspiración que construye las bases necesarias para la conformación de un mejor país. Pero es además, una propuesta plagada de innovación que ha venido a abrirle un espacio a la música tradicional venezolana en la palestra de la música universal.</p>
<p>Womex (World Music Expo) es un proyecto internacional que desde 1994 brinda apoyo y fomenta el desarrollo del World Music. El evento principal es una exposición que se realiza anualmente en diferentes locaciones de Europa.

Los músicos y sellos disqueros tienen la oportunidad de hacer contactos para giras internacionales y distribución discográfica. Este año están inscritas mas de 1.200 compañías y festivales, mas de 200 artistas, delegados y productores musicales y mas de 600 expositores.</p>

Allí tendrán la maravillosa oportunidad de deleitar al público presente  con su ingeniosa visión de la música venezolana y el virtuosismo que los ha hecho merecedores de varios premios en Venezuela y el mundo, llevando como bandera la  música venezolana y al instrumento más icónico de nuestra cultura: “ EL CUATRO VENEZOLANO”.</p>
<p>Estar en Womex es un sueño para cualquier músico y por primera vez en la historia de esta feria  han seleccionado a una agrupación venezolana para que participe. Esto es historia y un logro sin precedentes para la música hecha en Venezuela. Es sin duda un acontecimiento que nos hará visible en el ámbito del World Music, que hará resonar las cuerdas del Cuatro en  los más importantes festivales de música y en los más sorprendentes recovecos del planeta. Para poder estar presente necesitamos 17.000$, este dinero se utilizara para comprar pasajes desde Venezuela hasta Santiago de Compostela, hospedaje para 7 personas, comidas, traslados internos  durante 6 días y los honorarios del equipo técnico, así que necesitamos recaudar este dinero y nos encantaría que tu formaras parte de este acontecimiento, puedes contribuir con la cantidad que este a tu alcance, estamos seguros de que tu colaboración nos hará recolectar lo que necesitamos para estar presente en este importante evento. y si no puedes colaborar con nosotros en metálico, ayudamos a difundir este mensaje compartiéndolo a través de las diferentes redes sociales. </p>

<p>A magickal tarot deck woven with insights and guided messages to support the traveller on the complex journey of life.</p>
<h3><strong>My Story</strong></h3>
<p>I've been creating digital art for 15 years. My passion is to take others on a journey through their imagination. The inspiration for the Rainbow Travellers Tarot began many years ago when I first began creating mythical and fantasy images. My spiritual journey of the past ten years has led me through a deep exploration of the tarot, and the archetypes that began to appear in my images.</p>
<p>The artwork and divinatory meanings of the cards are shaped by my years of study and will stray from traditional archetypes to provide the reader/querent with guidance.</p>
<p>The major arcana contains 22 cards, with a unique spin on the traditional symbols. ""The Traveller"" replaces ""The Fool"" and other changes lead to a unique and enlightening journey through the tarot. The cards can be also used with traditional spreads and interpretations. </p>
<p>The minor arcana will provide guided messages to support the querent's journey of the mind (wands), body (pentacles), heart (cups) and soul (swords). This deck goes beyond the here and now and calls upon the mystics that whisper to us with wisdom that serves our higher purpose. </p>
<p>This labour of love is so important to me that at 57 years young I have committed myself full-time to complete the editing, printing, and promotion of the 78-card Rainbow Travellers Tarot deck. I am also authoring an e-book and e-course on intuitive reading that can help even the novice reader gain insights and answers.</p>
<p>I look forward to sharing the journey with you!</p>

Public art brings people together, it stirs our collective minds, it brightens our colorless winters and adds small doses of magic to our lives.<br/><br/>This project is an initative from the wacky folks at <a href=""http://weliveuphere.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">We Live Up Here</a>, the collaboration project about life in the Nickel City. Last year, we made a photography book about Sudbury. This year, we want to do <a href=""https://vimeo.com/56566222"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">more than a book</a>. We want to start conversations, spark community involvement and have a positive impact on this place we call home. That's where the murals come in.</p>
<h3>Mural #1 : You Are Beautiful</h3>
<p>Sudbury is beautiful. We want to remind people of that. This first mural on Durham street downtown will build community pride, inspire love for our ever-evolving core and add a little color to our award-winning winters.</p>
<p><img alt=""You Are Beautiful"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/6W21Lfl.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""You Are Beautiful""/></p>
<p>You Are Beautiful is part of a <a href=""http://you-are-beautiful.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">global campaign</a> instigated by one man, Matthew Hoffman from the US, and described as a simple, powerful statement aspiring to create moments of positive self realization.</p>
<p>We have been in cahoots with the kind folks from Barrydowne Paints and Paul Zulich from Zulich Enterprises who owns the wall of interest. Everyone is excited about this project. The plan is to complete this mural by the end of the summer.</p>
<h3>Mural #2 : Let's Drive There</h3>
<p>We have discovered some incredible archive photography from the Sudbury area from the early 1900’s. We thought up a way of showcasing some of them by wheatpasting largescale black and white prints on retaining walls. We're going to test this century old technique for our second mural on the Kingsway.</p>
<p>The first mural we hope to do will showcase some photography from an article in the Sudbury Star dating back to the early 50’s.</p>
<p><img alt=""Let's drive there"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/qOxTzsC.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Let's drive there""/></p>
<p>We believe that historical photography merged with smart taglines (inspired by the most popular of the thousands of pins we made last year) is a winning formula in creating beautiful public art that is well grounded in Sudbury’s rich history and that will have a positive impact in the community.</p>
<h3>Mural #3 : Sudburians at the Market</h3>
<p>A few months ago we launched <a href=""http://sudburians.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sudburians.com</a>, a video portraits gallery of inspiring citizens. The Sudburians at the Market project piggy-backs on that concept, but instead of showcasing inspiring citizens, we'll be putting every Sudburian we can in the spotlight.</p>
<p><img alt=""Sudburians"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/PtrXQC6.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Sudburians""/></p>
<p>We will be at the Market on August 10th and 11th for one weekend only. We will take your photo and print it. We'll then proceed to pasting them around the Market on the retail units. We will cover the Market with the faces of those who attend it; ordinary citizens owning the public space in an extraordinary way.</p>

<h3>Dance For The Dawn: Our Story</h3>
<p>Hello friends! We are Lithuanian burners. Dance For The Dawn idea was born in Black Rock City, while dreaming to built clear object that has esthetic look while being dynamic. Inspiration for the name came after witnessing dozens of sunrises in this amazing city existing only few months per year. It seems that each sunrise brought closer to the vision of building something that reflects view of the world and harmony in movement.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1499368876/rmrreb6m7wunruxslngy.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The first sketches were made straight after coming back from Burning Man 2016. We went forward with the idea and after being awarded the Burning Man Honoraria Art Grant we joined forces with VGTU LinkMenu fabrikas team of engineers and designers to bring Dance For The Dawn to life.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1499369385/hhk7na2q2zcb9whxh2c7.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The installation is 23 feet wide and 13 feet tall. The iris of an Eye is formed out of 300 hands that are spinning on a metal circle creating hypnotizing feeling of pulling you into The Sunrise. Every hand will have a mirror in the palm and these will be creating hundreds of sun bunnies dancing around in the desert. At night time the installation will be decorated by hundreds of LEDs to create magical experience.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1499369438/j2t1mmmcyk1v1n9c9k52.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The whole concept symbolizes our unity and living in synchronous harmony. Watching the sunrise together brings us closer to the root values and reveals Burning Man 2017 art theme – Radical Ritual.</p>

<h3>We Need Your Love &amp; Support!</h3>
<p>The project was awarded with Burning Man Honoraria Art Grant. The funding we got from Burning Man has covered the building of the main metal part of the eye.</p>

<h3>THE FLOWER TOWER</h3>
<p>By day, the Tower will be a striking structure of colorful beauty, calling people to enter and leave behind their difficulties to become lighter, happier, and more relaxed. By night, the Tower will be a place of great intensity because it will use fire to burn off all the grief, stress, and confusion left behind during the day. We draw on the essential life-giving cycle of photosynthesis as our metaphor. Photosynthesis is the world’s breath, taking in and giving out. Likewise, the Flower Tower absorbs negative energy, transforms it through fire, and gives off positive energy. People enter the Flower Tower, leave behind the noise of the outside world, and are instantly awestruck by thousands of flowers. This is the transformational magic of the Flower Tower. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thousands of painted metal flowers will cover the Tower. Each flower will be unique and made by hand. The ornate, flower-covered Tower will be grounded by four buttresses and topped by a narrow spire. Fire is also crucial to the Tower’s visual and spiritual experiences. There will be 28 fire effects emitting from flowers, and outside the Tower, four fire pits, located in sacramental positions, will warm participants at night.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We are honored and extremely excited to watch an incredible volunteer movement already getting underway. We started making metal flowers in April with a just handful of artists. But word quickly spread about what we are doing, and many people have started to join us as we make thousands of flowers for the Tower. By the time the Tower is completed, our team will have included people from near and far who want to contribute a hand-crafted flower to the Tower. </p>
<p>The Flower Tower is the natural next step in our ongoing contributions to the community of Black Rock City.  For Kevin Clark, the lead artist at Reaed In Steel, this is the culmination of his vision to build a temple-like structure for  Burning Man.</p>
<p>Everyone at Reared In Steel is driven by a deep desire to construct spaces that create memorable experiences for people.  The Flower Tower realizes our vision because it is a constructed, sculptural space that transforms people who experience it.</p>
<p>Burning Man Arts awards grants to a select number of artists and we are one of the chosen ones, however, we still need to raise more funds to complete this project.  Your contribution to our project will help us with our transportation costs, materials for lighting, paint, flame effects and propane.  We estimate it will take three (3) 40’ trailers to transport the Flower Tower to Burning Man.  The Flower Tower will have 28 flame effects……that’s ALOT of propane!  </p>
<p>Please consider contributing to our project and receive one of our great perks.  You can also follow the progress of the Flower Tower on Facebook and Instagram at Reared In Steel.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

Please consider contributing to our project and receive one of our great perks.  You can also follow the progress of the Flower Tower on Facebook and Instagram at Reared In Steel.

My brother and sister were my closest friends growing up and I don't think they fully understood me.  I spent a good deal of my time with a pencil or some kind of doodling tool in my hands. My artistic skill was the one thing I knew I could shine at and be accepted for. During my entire grade school career, I excelled as a top student artistically until graduation, taking college credits along with me. Entering adulthood took a toll on my interest in art.  I began to focus on discovering who I was as a person, resulting in action that led to me having to leave home at the age of 18. Survival was now priority and art took a further seat back in my list of things to do.</p><p>As a new adult living on my own, I was quite ambitious and a bit compulsive. When I had an idea, I went for it. One of those ideas happened to involve adult entertainment. This is not to say I wanted to become a ""porn star"". I had many interests, including being a runway model (people put the idea in my head because of my height and slender build). But with no help or direction, porn seemed to be rather easy and since I did have an ironic interest in performing on film, I applied. In short, at the age of 19, I began my extensive career as an adult film star. Once I'd done my first scene and graced my first cover not long after, I knew it was something I'd have to run with. So I did and ensured that I was the best at it. While my popularity was immensely growing, years went by and I found myself feeling empty.  There were things I still needed to fulfill. I knew one thing was my art. I stopped doing adult films to focus on the next chapter of my life.  I needed to share my talent with the world. But I had doubts. Would people come out to see and support a former porn star? </p><p>As a man on a mission, I don't let anything stand in my way. So momentarily setting fear and doubt aside, I am excited and anticipating my first ever art exhibition. I have done so much, been so many places, I've seen a lot and learned a lot. I have a unique story to tell. Through my work, I hope to raise questions and curiosity from you.  I hope you see beauty, pain, joy, fear - the visual emotion each piece evokes and I hope that you will be able to relate. </p><p>This will be my first time taking on a project of this magnitude. I am so passionate about it and will put nothing less than my all into it. I want this to be an experience more than an exhibition. I can only accomplish this with your help.

That is something I have inherent in me and I am grateful for. But, at my core is a scared little boy who wants to be liked and accepted. I'm excited and thankful to all of you in advance.

Some of our own most intense spiritual moments have come from being in temples at previous Nowheres and other burns around the world. We hope to be able to gift such moments to you by building the Temple of Reflection for this year’s Nowhere.</p><br/><p>The building materials and logistics required to create the Temple of Reflection come at a cost. We hope our design and philosophy resonate with you. And we kindly invite you to contribute and help gift this temple in its ideal form, to facilitate beautiful moments at Nowhere.</p><div><br/></div><div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1348358/files/20150402003715-temple_of_reflection_center.jpg?1427960235"" src="""" style=""""/></p></div><br/><h1>Concept/Philosophy</h1><p></p><p><span>Imagine being in front of a fogged mirror in your home, at those moments that you are at rest and in peace. You start to write. There is no necessity, you just write. You feel free to let the words flow because they can easily be removed with only a single wipe. You really start out loosely drawing and writing, but in the process your deeper consciousness takes you to places where you need to be. In between, you wipe the mirror clean, to create more space for your story, every time you clean the slate you look yourself in the eye and reach deeper.</span></p><br/><p>Now think of a sundial, in which the ever changing angle of the sun rays create a continuously changing projection on the desert soil, a reminder of the here and now, of the coming and going of light and dark, of eternity and impermanence.</p><br/><p>At the Temple of Reflection you are inside thise sundial and surrounded by mirrors, on which you can express your deepest thoughts and wipe them away to clear the mirror and look deeper into your own soul.</p><br/>Eight reflective crystals will be ritually placed in the temple’s spires at the start of Nowhere, to help create a pure and sacred space for us. At the end of Nowhere, we will ritually remove the crystals, releasing the building of its sacred function.<p></p><div><br/></div><div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1348367/files/20150402003854-temple_of_reflection_frontal.jpg?1427960334"" src="""" style=""""/></p></div><br/><h1>Design</h1><p>The Temple of Reflection has an overall design that aims to enable both the communal and the private experience; to facilitate the transformative aspect of being at Nowhere.</p><br/><p>It was influenced by diverse inspirations of sacred, spiritual, memorial, and experiential spaces and buildings from different parts of the world. Amongst them are Oscar Niemeyer's cathedral in Brasilia, Zen Buddhist temples and specifically their influence on the architecture of Kenzo Tange, the Poème Electronique building by Le Corbusier, and the Martyrs Memorial in Algiers by Bachir Telles. </p><br/><p>The basic shape that repeats itself in the structure of the Temple is an octagon. The octagon has a common or similar symbolism in cultures and philosophies ranging from Buddhism to Islam to Paganism: regeneration, totality, rebirth, transition, and the interplay between heaven and earth, the eternal and the temporary. </p><br/><p>Its exterior shape and design consists of connected legs that curve inwards, upwards, and then outwards into 'spires', in a movement that could be seen symbolic for processes of individual and collective growth and transformation. A last minute addition to the design [not shown in the pictures yet], are eight reflective crystals, that will be placed in the spires and will ""activate"" the energy of the temple. Suspended from the legs are pieces of white shadow fabric, tension-suspend outwards and downwards; white because it's associated with the sacred, purity and virtue, but also mourning. They create four openings to enter the temple, for the four directions of the wind.</p><p><br/></p><div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1348374/files/20150402003946-temple_of_reflection_interior.jpg?1427960386"" src="""" style=""""/></p></div><p><br/></p><p>In the interior of the temple there are vertical columns, accentuating the upward movement of the structure, and a central round ""altar"". On both the vertical columns and the central altar there is reflective material, on which participants can express their thoughts and feelings with dry erasable markers. </p><br/><p>The altar itself is the spiritual center piece of the temple. The altar’s surface is a mirror reflecting the skies directly above, with the path in between the heavens and the earth paved by the ‘spires’ of the exterior shape. As above, so below. </p><br/><p>When looked at from above, the temple is designed to resemble an abstract clock or sundial, with the central altar welcoming the sun at noon. During the day, the interplay between reflections, shapes, shadows and lines will facilitate the beautiful moments we envision. And at night, the temple will be lit to accentuate its function as a 24/7 sanctuary.</p><br/><p>During the days of the event, the temple is open for communal activities, such as weddings, vow renewals, and memorials. Apart from that, there is the possibility of hosting workshops there that align with the emotional, spiritual, and energetic objectives of the temple.

A place to mourn, and to celebrate. To connect, and to dream. To meditate, and to express. Some of our own most intense spiritual moments have come from being in temples at previous Nowheres and other burns around the world. We hope to be able to gift such moments to you by building the Temple of Reflection for this year’s Nowhere.The building materials and logistics required to create the Temple of Reflection come at a cost. We hope our design and philosophy resonate with you. And we kindly invite you to contribute and help gift this temple in its ideal form, to facilitate beautiful moments at Nowhere.Concept/PhilosophyImagine being in front of a fogged mirror in your home, at those moments that you are at rest and in peace. You start to write. There is no necessity, you just write. You feel free to let the words flow because they can easily be removed with only a single wipe. You really start out loosely drawing and writing, but in the process your deeper consciousness takes you to places where you need to be. In between, you wipe the mirror clean, to create more space for your story, every time you clean the slate you look yourself in the eye and reach deeper.Now think of a sundial, in which the ever changing angle of the sun rays create a continuously changing projection on the desert soil, a reminder of the here and now, of the coming and going of light and dark, of eternity and impermanence.At the Temple of Reflection you are inside thise sundial and surrounded by mirrors, on which you can express your deepest thoughts and wipe them away to clear the mirror and look deeper into your own soul.Eight reflective crystals will be ritually placed in the temple’s spires at the start of Nowhere, to help create a pure and sacred space for us. At the end of Nowhere, we will ritually remove the crystals, releasing the building of its sacred function.DesignThe Temple of Reflection has an overall design that aims to enable both the communal and the private experience; to facilitate the transformative aspect of being at Nowhere.It was influenced by diverse inspirations of sacred, spiritual, memorial, and experiential spaces and buildings from different parts of the world. Amongst them are Oscar Niemeyer's cathedral in Brasilia, Zen Buddhist temples and specifically their influence on the architecture of Kenzo Tange, the Poème Electronique building by Le Corbusier, and the Martyrs Memorial in Algiers by Bachir Telles. The basic shape that repeats itself in the structure of the Temple is an octagon. The octagon has a common or similar symbolism in cultures and philosophies ranging from Buddhism to Islam to Paganism: regeneration, totality, rebirth, transition, and the interplay between heaven and earth, the eternal and the temporary. Its exterior shape and design consists of connected legs that curve inwards, upwards, and then outwards into 'spires', in a movement that could be seen symbolic for processes of individual and collective growth and transformation. A last minute addition to the design [not shown in the pictures yet], are eight reflective crystals, that will be placed in the spires and will ""activate"" the energy of the temple. Suspended from the legs are pieces of white shadow fabric, tension-suspend outwards and downwards; white because it's associated with the sacred, purity and virtue, but also mourning. They create four openings to enter the temple, for the four directions of the wind.In the interior of the temple there are vertical columns, accentuating the upward movement of the structure, and a central round ""altar"". On both the vertical columns and the central altar there is reflective material, on which participants can express their thoughts and feelings with dry erasable markers. The altar itself is the spiritual center piece of the temple. The altar’s surface is a mirror reflecting the skies directly above, with the path in between the heavens and the earth paved by the ‘spires’ of the exterior shape. As above, so below. When looked at from above, the temple is designed to resemble an abstract clock or sundial, with the central altar welcoming the sun at noon. During the day, the interplay between reflections, shapes, shadows and lines will facilitate the beautiful moments we envision. And at night, the temple will be lit to accentuate its function as a 24/7 sanctuary.During the days of the event, the temple is open for communal activities, such as weddings, vow renewals, and memorials. Apart from that, there is the possibility of hosting workshops there that align with the emotional, spiritual, and energetic objectives of the temple. The temple will be ritualistically opened and closed at the beginning and end of Nowhere.Temple GuardiansHuman extensions of the structure, and facilitators of the processes that happen inside it. Temple Guardians hold the space of the temple, maintain an environment that allows equal access for everyone to have the experience and expression they need, and keep the temple itself, as well as the participants who visit it, safe. We welcome anyone that feels their calling, to help out and become a guardian during the event.What we needFor construction of the temple, the following items are part of our budget:

By utilizing an open submission process, they created an environment where true collaboration could occur spontaneously, experimentation would be met with enthusiasm and work could be created that otherwise wouldn’t have been attempted.<br/><br/></span></span></p>

</div></div>","Our StoryHi, I'm not Sarah McLachlan. But what I am is a woman with long brown hair and a sultry singing voice, sitting here, writing these words you're reading, asking--no, PLEADING--for your help. 
Light some scented candles and check out this backstory:
In the autumn of 2008, Jaclyn Backhaus and Andrew Neisler joined together to create Fresh Ground Pepper- a safe space wherein emerging artists could share their unfinished work with a supportive audience, willing to offer feedback. By utilizing an open submission process, they created an environment where true collaboration could occur spontaneously, experimentation would be met with enthusiasm and work could be created that otherwise wouldn’t have been attempted.
Fresh Ground Pepper is now in its fourth year of featuring work by theatricals, musicians, choreographers, filmmakers, puppeteers, visual artists, comedians, media designers, buskers, chefs and creators of sport. Every month, FGP seeks to provide a completely unique experience. (Visit fgpnyc.com for more info on all of our events)
And, most importantly: FGP does not charge artists to participate or audience to attend their events. Everything is FREE.

What We Need
Now, Fresh Ground Pepper is thriving in many ways. But they still need your support! 
Artists who work with Fresh Ground Pepper cannot always afford the materials or the rehearsal space necessary to continue creating. Kinko's is expensive, and so are rehearsal rooms that have air-conditioning and floors without splinters. And so I, Not-Sarah McLachlan, and a group of my devoted non-fans developed the FGPCA, to fight the world's fight in stopping cruelty to artists.
Look into their eyes. See their hurt. See their suffering. Help us help them to buy cans of paint and lace trim, and help them thrive.
Your donations will help us to:
-Provide rehearsal space for our participating artists
-Print scripts
-Supply materials for installation and fine artists
-Find better and bigger spaces for their events
And most of all, 
-Keep FGP not only free to participate in but also free to attend! 
 
What You Get 
To sweeten the FGPCA's deal, I've helped them come up with a few perks we will bring you in exchange for your generous donation. You may get a picture of the artist you adopted. You may receive a beautiful tote bag. You will not receive a CD of my greatest hits. You will most likely receive a barrel of sweet deals at our 4th Annual Toobie Awards! Check out the list on the right-hand side of your screen.
You're not going to want to miss your chance to help FGP's starving artists. And you will be thanked greatly for your gift to us. It is almost as sweet as the gift of song, which is something I am not gifted in.
