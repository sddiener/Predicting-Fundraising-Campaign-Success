<h3>We are WHITMORE ECLECTIC 501 (c) 3</h3>
<p>            The primary goal of The W.E. is to produce the highest caliber of theatrical productions that inspires our youth, seniors and all others to participate in the exploration of their unique, cultural identity and involve them in projects which will harness and give voice to their creative energies for the public good.  Our first work out the gate for this season is PROOF by David Auburn.</p>
<p>We will achieve this goal by using workshops, and out reach programs that work in conjunction with our full-length theatrical productions as a platform for education, social awareness and cultural-enrichment. The Whitmore Eclectic’s has created several workshop series that will be launched this December, such as, ‘Bring The Voice”, a workshop series designed to introduce children with life threatening illness to methods of directing, acting and production design and to help them produce their own show.  “Redesign the World” art and scenic design class that will teach the importance of and how to use reclaimed and recycled materials for set design and al types of art.  These are just two examples of The Whitmore Eclectic’s commitment to the community and the public good.</p>
<p> Whitmore Eclectic is nearing the launch of our 2013/2014 season, “The Sight of the Story!”  This next creative chapter will include published and original works, that are sure to evoke thought, summon emotion and excite the senses.</p>
<p>            First on deck, we have PROOF by David Auburn, starring DANIELA RUAH and JAMES WHTMORE JR. Coming this April at The Hayworth Theatre. April 27- May25, Saturdays and Sunday's only.</p>
<p>            Please join us as we work together to positively influence the art community in Los Angeles by producing the highest quality of small stage production possible, sharing our tools as crafts people with the youth of our community, and help deepen the appreciation of the Living American Theater, which is the spirit of the American Democracy.</p>

<h3>PROOF</h3>
<p>We are opening this season with PROOF a show that is at the heart of our mission. A story that speaks about personal struggle and about the right of every human being to be heard.  Helping us produce this show helps to bring voice to a part of the community that often is left unheard; those that are deemed, ""mentally ill"".  With this production we hope to create an experience for the audience that resembles the internal experience of someone with schizopherinia. This work is to help create a greater empathy for people struggling with mental illness.  There is beauty and power in all people and things and we hope to shed light on that fact with this production.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>WE need all the help we can muster! Like us on FACEBOOK and come see the show. Bring your friends and start talking. Our goal is to start more dialogue about PROOF's subject matter. Some people just can’t contribute, but that doesn’t mean they can’t help:</p>
<p>Help us to spread the word and tell the world that the human experience varies from person to person and each and every experience needs to be honored and respected.</p>

<h3>ABOUT THE PLAY </h3>
<b>
3...2...1</b> is a riveting play about Clint and Kyle, two young men from Wetaskiwin, Alberta, who skip their best friend Danny’s funeral and lock themselves in a garage with several cases of beer, Jack Daniels, a cornucopia of pharmaceuticals and broken dreams…and they’re not coming out until everything’s been drunk, popped, shot up and smoked - with an ending that will blow you away. 3...2...1 is a raw, violent and sometimes funny examination of life, religion, love, friendship and homophobia. Imagine a bender that just won’t end. <b>3...2...1 is Trailer Park Boys meets Long Day’s Journey into Night. </b>Extremely coarse language. Adult situations. Gunshots. Violence. References to drugs, alcohol and Wetaskiwin. WARNING: “3…2…1 makes you laugh until your stomach hurts and then punches you in it.” What we need from you to bring this play to the Winnipeg Fringe and then back here to Vancouver is the following:</div><div>

<p>Designer (Winnipeg Production): Sofia Lukie</p>
<p><b>What are the costs? </b></p>
<p><b>       Here is the breakdown of what our $6000 will go towards:</b></p>
</div>
<ul>
<li>$1500 - Travel costs for the two actors and the stage manager to the Winnipeg Fringe.<br/>
</li>
<li>$1900 - Wages for the Creative Team (Director, Stage Manager, Designer - estimation does not include actors)<br/>
</li>
<li>$350 - Materials and build cost of the set</li>
<li>$750 - Winnipeg Fringe Festival Fee<br/>
</li>
<li>$1500 - Put towards our future Production in Vancouver </li>
</ul>
<div>As of now, to save money, we are not paying ourselves as actors as part of our fundraising campaign. All the funding goes towards our hires and artistic costs related with designs and fees! </div>
</div> <div> <h3>Paying the tab<br/>
</h3> <p>We believe in <b>paying our artists</b>. We feel that we’re living in the prohibition era of paid work for young artists and one of our most important goals as a company is to pay amounts that recognize the value of the work created. ""3...2...1"" is the first of hopefully many productions from our company, and also the first of many shows we produce where the actors, designers, directors, stage managers and everyone else actually get paid. As a new company, we can't apply for grants yet which severely hinders our financial possibilities. Grant application rules state a company must be in operation for one year before applying. In the future we plan to find other means to make the money for our productions, but right now we need your help to get off the ground.<br/><br/>The Perks we're providing are both valued and fun. We wanted to play with the theme of a SpeakEasy and the bar world as well as provide actual tangible goods involved with the shows. Markian's a good bartender, and Mike just pretends he is, so combined they should create some real gems (crap) (okay really good drinks actually)<br/></p>

<h3>Closing time<br/>
</h3>
<p>First off, thanks for reading this far. Secondly, we want to reiterate the point that we're pushing the boundaries of a startup theatre company. We're not striving to stage a show in our parents backyard, we're hungry for quality in all aspects, and the only thing holding us back is a little bit of scratch. We've assembled a team of strong willed, creative, and hard working individuals that are committed to this project and this company. 3...2...1 is a phenomenal show that deserves to see the stage both at the Winnipeg Fringe and here in Vancouver and we think you want to see it too. <br/></p>

We've got a creative team assembled for our first show and venues booked. What we're trying to say is - we have put our time and money into this endeavour, and the next step is YOU: our future audience.  





ABOUT THE PLAY 

3...2...1 is a riveting play about Clint and Kyle, two young men from Wetaskiwin, Alberta, who skip their best friend Danny’s funeral and lock themselves in a garage with several cases of beer, Jack Daniels, a cornucopia of pharmaceuticals and broken dreams…and they’re not coming out until everything’s been drunk, popped, shot up and smoked - with an ending that will blow you away. 3...2...1 is a raw, violent and sometimes funny examination of life, religion, love, friendship and homophobia. Imagine a bender that just won’t end. 3...2...1 is Trailer Park Boys meets Long Day’s Journey into Night. Extremely coarse language. Adult situations. Gunshots. Violence. References to drugs, alcohol and Wetaskiwin. WARNING: “3…2…1 makes you laugh until your stomach hurts and then punches you in it.” What we need from you to bring this play to the Winnipeg Fringe and then back here to Vancouver is the following:





Who's our creative team??
One of our biggest mandate principals is to pay our artists for their hard work and creativity. By donating today you won't just be supporting SpeakEasy Theatre - but these talented emerging artists!


Director of ""3...2...1"" : Kayvon Kelly   
Stage Manager/ Desinger (Vancouver Production): Sarah Mabberley 
Designer (Winnipeg Production): Sofia Lukie
What are the costs? 
       Here is the breakdown of what our $6000 will go towards:


$1500 - Travel costs for the two actors and the stage manager to the Winnipeg Fringe.

$1900 - Wages for the Creative Team (Director, Stage Manager, Designer - estimation does not include actors)

$350 - Materials and build cost of the set
$750 - Winnipeg Fringe Festival Fee

$1500 - Put towards our future Production in Vancouver 

As of now, to save money, we are not paying ourselves as actors as part of our fundraising campaign. All the funding goes towards our hires and artistic costs related with designs and fees! 
  Paying the tab
 We believe in paying our artists. We feel that we’re living in the prohibition era of paid work for young artists and one of our most important goals as a company is to pay amounts that recognize the value of the work created. ""3...2...1"" is the first of hopefully many productions from our company, and also the first of many shows we produce where the actors, designers, directors, stage managers and everyone else actually get paid. As a new company, we can't apply for grants yet which severely hinders our financial possibilities. Grant application rules state a company must be in operation for one year before applying. In the future we plan to find other means to make the money for our productions, but right now we need your help to get off the ground.The Perks we're providing are both valued and fun. We wanted to play with the theme of a SpeakEasy and the bar world as well as provide actual tangible goods involved with the shows. Markian's a good bartender, and Mike just pretends he is, so combined they should create some real gems (crap) (okay really good drinks actually)

WANT TO SUPPORT US EVEN MORE? COME TO OUR FUNDRAISER TO MEET THE TEAM, DRINK AND CELEBRATE!  

SPEAKEASY LAUNCH EVENT



Join SpeakEasy Theatre Company for an evening of music, booze and friends! SpeakEasy Theatre Company Society is a brand new emerging theatre company based out of Vancouver, BC.

Closing time

First off, thanks for reading this far. Secondly, we want to reiterate the point that we're pushing the boundaries of a startup theatre company. We're not striving to stage a show in our parents backyard, we're hungry for quality in all aspects, and the only thing holding us back is a little bit of scratch. We've assembled a team of strong willed, creative, and hard working individuals that are committed to this project and this company. 3...2...1 is a phenomenal show that deserves to see the stage both at the Winnipeg Fringe and here in Vancouver and we think you want to see it too. 
Thanks for reading!

<p></p>For almost 40 years, the Canadian Improv Games (CIG) has  taught kids, all across the country, the skills of improvisation and provided them with a stage to hone these skills. For a lot of youth it's the most important part of their high school experience, and teaches them skills they use their entire lives, such as teamwork, confidence, decisiveness and empathy.
In the Sudbury and Northern Ontario region (SNO), we face some special challenges providing teens the same quality of experience as other regions. The SNO Region is geographically one of Canada’s largest, meaning participants and  volunteers often must travel quite a distance to get to a workshop or a night of play. Your Donations directly impact the student experience.<p></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>
<p></p>To keep the cost of participation down for schools, we’re splitting our immense region into two zones, in which there will nights of play, workshops. While this reduces travel costs for many teams, it increases production and travel costs for Canadian Improv Games. Running two zones also creates new opportunities for schools that couldn’t participate previously, and allows us to grow our volunteer trainer base in those areas.
Once established, these two new zones will be financially sustainable, however we need your help in these early stages.
Your donations will support this initial outreach push, offset venue costs, and subsidise trainer and volunteer travel.</div><div>Yes, also we have perks. We have t-shirts and pins and other stuff for individuals, as well as advertising-based perks aimed at businesses (though technically nothing stops businesses from buying t-shirts, or individuals from buying advertising). Some of them are pretty cool, so check them out!<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span></p>

<h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>
<p>The only way to understand the impact
that the CIG has on a person is to speak to somebody who has been
affected by improv. So let me tell you about how it's changed my
life. My name is AJ Comeau, and the launch of this campaign coincides
with my tenth year doing improv. There are lots of ways it has
affected me, but here's one: I started in grade 9 playing games in an
after-school club. It was fun, social, creative, and the weekly shows
we did for other students did wonders for my fragile, teenage
confidence. It gave me a sense of community with my school, and close
camaraderie with my friends. We started competing in the CIG when I
was in grade 11, and the skills I learned competing were more than
just about having fun, being social, or my creativity, they taught me
how to listen. Listening is one of the core skills we focus on
teaching. In a nutshell it's the awareness of the people around you
and a sense of direction that comes from it. All that gained from the
things you see and hear, and in hindsight it seems silly to admit,
but I was a bad listener and didn't know it until then. Learning how
to listen has made me a better student, a better employee, and a
better person than I was. Would I have learned it eventually? Maybe,
but I'm thankful I'll never have to know.</p>
<p>I volunteer because there's probably a
kid in every high school class who needs what I needed then, and
improv delivers on that. Your contributions will help us deliver
improv to them.</p>
</div><div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p></p>
<p>And it's not just financial
contributions that matter. Tell people about us, and about our
campaign. Like us on Facebook and share our Indiegogo page. Tweet
about us on Twitter. Get in touch, volunteer, share your story.
Improv and the CIG have made their mark on youth all over Canada, and
you can make your mark on a piece of it. And while you're at it,
remember the Improv Oath, that is pledged at the beginning of every
CIG show:</p>
<p><i>We
have come together,<br/>In
the spirit of loving competition,<br/>To
celebrate the Canadian Improv Games,<br/>We
promise:<br/>To
uphold the ideals of improvisation,<br/>To
cooperate with one another,<br/>To
learn from each other,<br/>To
commit ourselves to the moment<br/>And,
above all, <strong>to
have a good time!</strong>

<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>RAW is a process-based dance showcase of new solo work from five distinguished local dance-artists: Renay Aumiller, Murielle Elizéon, Megan Mazarick, Tommy Noonan, and Matthew Young. Gritty and unembellished, these dances take the audience on a journey through the topography of The Fruit to expose overlooked nooks and crannies, rooms which represent, visually and metaphorically, the unique minds of the artists inhabiting them.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why Are We Doing This?</h3>
<p>The idea for this shared performance came from the want and need for dialogue and conversation among dance artists who make interesting and varied work. How can we, as artists who are not necessarily emerging in the Durham dance community, grow and challenge how we make dance? Simultaneously, how can we support one another’s varying approaches to dance-making through dialogue, conversation, and community? And crucially, how can audiences authentically participate in the dance-making process?</p>
<p>Durham is such an appealing, engaged community that seeps into everything it offers its residents. But recently, with the rate of growth and change to the city, that aspect has felt threatened. This show is a response to the need to sustain that essence of our community – and that doesn’t necessarily mean growing in size or ambition. Sometimes community growth means nurturing the nuanced qualities of those who have been here all the while.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We are needing to raise $1500, which is one third of the total amount needed to successfully launch RAW. So far, we have fundraised the remaining two-thirds through community workshops, master classes, and advanced ticket sales. This campaign will fund the venue rental and support a nominal wage for our production team.</p>
<p>We are a fiscally sponsored organization in which all of your donations are tax deductible. What a great time of year to Pay it Forward!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>RAD has an excellent track record of meeting our fundraising goals for the last 6 years. We are confident that with careful planning, incredible audience support for all of the involved artists, and the strong network of community support you provide, we will no doubt meet our financial and community-oriented goals for RAW.</p>
<p>Any self-produced creative project has some element of production, financial, or feasibility risk to it, but the beauty of RAW is that we are minimizing all of this! We want to present works that are low risk to the artists and audiences, yet exponentially fascinating to watch.</p>

  The Impact This show has already begun to ignite a fascinating, essential series of conversations around contemporary Poland.  It is particularly unique to show this piece in Poland as ""We Keep Coming Back"" offers a complex diasporic Jewish perspective around contemporary Poland that goes well beyond some of the more traditional perspectives of Poland and Polish people as ""the enemy"".We Keep Coming Back is a work that is seeking and advocating for a new, positive future for Judaism around the world -- and it does so by advocating for a more positive relationship for Jews in Poland.    Other Ways You Can Help If you can't personally support us, but you think you know someone who might, please share this with them.  And If you value this conversation, or value the work, please consider making a contribution.

Schreiber Studios and Studio 4 Acting School.  She has performed in numerous Off-Off Broadway productions including STUYVESANT TOWN: THIS IS YOUR HOME, which was presented at The Signature Theater in New York City. THE LOVE DEPARTMENT, an original radio play honoring the Golden Age of Radio.  FREED SPEECH portraying Linda Lovelace.  HIROSHIMA with music by Yoko Ono at Theater for the New City.  She has also appeared in numerous television shows and independent films.ADAM THORBURN (Director) is an award-winning playwright and free-lance writer.  He received his MFA in Theater from Sarah Lawrence College.  Thorburn adapted and directed FREED SPEECH, a staged-reading of testimony taken from the first public hearings on pornography and civil rights.  FREED SPEECH, which commemorated the publication of the book In Harm’s Way: The Pornography Civil Rights Hearings edited by Andrea Dworkin and Catharine A. MacKinnon, was performed at the New School for Social Research in 1998.  Thorburn was commissioned by the Citizen’s Housing and Planning Council to create the play STUYVESANT TOWN: THIS IS YOUR HOME.  Using primary source documents, STUYVESANT TOWN told the story of the fight to desegregate the New York housing complex in the 1940s and 50s.  Thorburn was commissioned by the estate of feminist icon Andrea Dworkin to create a play based on one of Dworkin’s unpublished manuscripts.  The final piece, entitled AFTERMATH, was performed for six nights at the Jefferson Market Library in Greenwich Village in May 2014 and again as part of the United Solo Theater Festival on Theater Row in October 2014.  A production of AFTERMATH was staged in Montreal by the Waterworks Company in September 2015; this fall the Waterworks Company will be touring Canada with AFTERMATH, bringing the production to Toronto and Ottawa.  Thorburn’s critical essays have appeared in Gay Community News, The Humanist, and Polari Magazine.KATHRYN COUGHLIN (Playwright) has had plays developed and produced by Field Trip Theater, Rorschach Theatre, Inkwell Theatre, 1MPF, DC-Page-to-Stage, St. Bonaventure University, The Disreputables and Meat and Bone Theatre Company.  Her plays include BIGGER THAN YOU, BIGGER THAN ME, MORE THAN BEFORE, SLIP, THEY SAY THERE'S A WAR GOING ON, SOUNDS OF ALARM and ALL WE HAVE.  As a dramaturg, Coughlin has worked with Taffety Punk Theatre Company, The DC Queer Theatre Festival, Young Playwrights’ Theater and served as the literary manager and producer of the Source Festival for five years.  Studio 28 Productions is a sponsored project of Fractured Atlas, a non-profit arts service organization.

<p>""The [U.S.] election is a time where we can [approach] a lot of themes"", explains director Georges Bigot. ""Manipulation, Power, Truth, Lie, Shadow, Light...and also Fear. It is the reason why I propose to Theatre Y to create an ensemble and to work on this tragedy of Macbeth; a tragedy where each word is a painting. It is a monument of art...to our basic fears and terrors. I<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">t is very important to share...and to talk about all this fear.”</span></p>
<p>This fall, Theatre Y will produce its most artistically ambitious project to date as part of the <a href=""http://www.shakespeare400chicago.com/events/bigot_macbeth.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Chicago Shakespeare 400 International Arts Festival</a>! Invited by the renowned Chicago Shakespeare Theatre, and under the direction of French theatre luminary Georges Bigot, Theatre Y will explore the nightmare of William Shakespeare's MACBETH. </p>
<p>It is Bigot's' vision, and Theatre Y's hope, that, through an intimate staging of MACBETH, we can better understand our modern world, our politics, ourselves, and our interconnection.  ""For me, art and theatre belong to everybody. And it is a food...a kind of agriculture for the soul"".<br/></p>
<p>We open October 19, 2016 at <a href=""www.chopintheatre.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Chopin Theatre</a> in Chicago. And we need your help to make it happen!<br/></p>
<h3>Who are the Theatre Y Ensemble?</h3>
<div>
<p>Theatre Y is dedicated to the international laboratory with an ever-diversifying group of collaborators from many lands.  <span style=""background-color: initial;"">To put it succinctly, we seek formidable allies worldwide and we produce work with them.</span></p>
</div>
<p>Over the last ten years, Theatre Y has garnered both critical and public acclaim for our daring and passionate work. Playing to sold-out audiences, Theatre Y's productions feature award-winning actors from the Chicago community and have been highly praised by theatre critics throughout the city. Chicago Stage Review has called Theatre Y's productions ""among the bravest and best of theater in Chicago"", and we have attracted a loyal and discerning audience.</p>
<p>MACBETH will be the first production created by the brand new Theatre Y Ensemble, established and directed by Georges Bigot. To read more about this exciting step in Theatre Y's evolution, visit our <a href=""http://www.theatre-y.com/the-ensemble/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ensemble page</a>.</p>
<h3>Who is Georges Bigot?</h3>
<p>Central to Ariane Mnouchkine’s Theatre du Soleil during the 80’s and 90’s, Georges Bigot is one of France’s most lauded contemporary actors. Known all over the world for highly physical ensemble work, his style reads like “mask in human form that, when turned towards an audience, hits you like a punch in the stomach”, Bigot “lights up our imaginations and overwhelms us even in memory<em>” (</em>Olivier Berardi<em>).</em></p>
<p><em></em></p>
<p><em><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1469930879/Georges_Bigot_Performing_in_The_Terrible_but_Unfinished_Story_of_Norodom_Sihanouk_King_of_Cambodia_at_the_Theatre_du_Soleil_tivopm.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></em></p>
<p></p>
<p>Sixteen years ago, as a student at Northern Illinois University, Theatre Y founder and Artistic Director, Melissa Lorraine, studied with Bigot. ""He was the first to shatter my expectations"" remembers Lorraine. After working with him for one month, she felt ""like I had never performed before; I didn't actually understand anything about the theatre; that I had never seen a real artist on stage until Georges Bigot"". </p>
<p><em></em></p>
<p><em><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1469931036/Bigot_Richard_II_vzjbcj.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></em></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Why MACBETH?</h3>
<div>To Bigot, MACBETH is ""both a nightmare and a cure"". To be sure, there are witches, ghosts, shrieking owls, and enough stormy weather to make anyone sleep no more, but how can a tragic tale of ruthless ambition, murder, and tyranny be hopeful? ""<span>When we understand that we have escaped from the ugly nightmare, we are so happy we are still alive...we are maybe more [appreciative of] this life and more respectful. It's a medicine from the human soul. For me, Shakespeare wrote a cure"".</span>
</div>
<div><span><br/></span></div>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">As for how we can best tell this nightmare on a very tight budget and in a very intimate space, Mssr. Bigot is blunt: ""</span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">We have no choice but to do theatre with everything because we have nothing"". </span>
</div>
<div>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1469929116/Bigot_directing_lzetiw.jpg"" src="""" style=""background-color: initial;""/><br/>
</div>
<div><span>
""I am so excited to be telling this story with Georges,"" says Lorraine. ""He has a wild and special vision for it, something piercing and vicious. Relentless. I believe Georges tells the truth, demands that everyone around him tells the truth, and that Shakespeare does the same. The two of them put together could create a cocktail that will wake up the masses. This is the hope.""<br/></span></div>
<div><span><br/></span></div>
<h3>Why are you taking a full year to produce MACBETH?</h3>
<div>Bigot requires full-commitment from the ensemble. We are analyzing the words of William Shakespeare in painstaking detail so we are acting ""at the foot of the letter"", stripping away all pretense and assumptions, looking deep within ourselves, relearning how to walk, talk, dance, and move so we fully embody, not just the characters, but the power, the manipulation, the fear, the paranoia, and the supernatural soliciting they represent. </div>
<div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1469929170/Macbeth_reading_fg9avq.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p></div>
<div>""I feel privileged to be a witness to this work"" says Lorraine. ""I feel privileged to be in the room and witness these actors being pushed to a refining, razor's edge"". To put it simply, if the purpose of the typical rehearsal process is to put all the pieces of a production puzzle together, Georges will not allow us to even assemble the puzzle until each piece is meticulously hand-crafted to perfection.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<h3>Sounds hard.</h3>
<div>It is! But it's also very rewarding. After all, ""the labor we delight in physics pain."" : )</div>
<div><br/></div> </div> <div> <h3>I want to help! What do you need?</h3> <p>Like any good, small, non-profit, art-focused theater company, we are quite adept at getting the most out of every penny we have. We have already been able to pay for Georges' travel and for rehearsal spaces up to this point. But, as this is our most ambitious production in our ten-year history, we hath not foisons enough to fill up our will. </p>
<p>In order to properly execute Georges Bigot's bold vision for MACBETH, we are asking all art and theatre lovers to consider contributing a total of $10,000. This generous amount will enable us to pay for Georges' future travel and lodging, rehearsal space going forward, costumes, props, set and lighting design, and marketing materials. </p>
<p>Actors will receive a small stipend that is already budgeted and is not part of this campaign. As Melissa Lorraine testifies: ""This is a real labor of love that Georges has gathered around himself"".</p>
<h3>That's a lot of money! What do I get? </h3>
<p>Because learning from and witnessing the dynamic power of Georges Bigot's creative mind is such a special experience, we want to share it with the city and the people of Chicago as much as possible. That is why most of our donation perks include not only complimentary tickets to our production of MACBETH, but also invitations to our September Launch Party with the cast and Georges, special previews and talk-backs, as well as an exclusive reception with Georges.</p>
<p>One very generous donor will be given property in Scotland, and the right to be called a Laird or Lady of Scotland. That's right. For our top donor, we will actually buy you actual land in actual Scotland - 100 square feet of it to be exact - through <a href=""http://www.highlandtitles.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Highland Titles</a>. Not only will you be able to refer to yourself as a Laird or Lady of Glencoe, but you will also have a tree planted in your honor, camping access to Keil Hill, and you will be helping preserve the lands and wild life of the Scottish Highlands.</p>
<p>Theatre Y is a registered 501(c)(3) non-profit, so any amount you can donate is tax deductible. Your generosity will be forever appreciated by all of us at Theatre Y.</p>
</div><div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Are you trying to win us with honest trifles only to betray's in deepest consequence?</h3>
<div>Nice one! And never!</div> <p>Live theatre, by it's nature, is unpredictable. We can memorize all our lines, commit blocking to muscle memory, and rehearse a show for an entire year and still be surprised during any given performance. Because this is a performance art, there is always a chance of shows being canceled or dates being postponed due to weather, performer health, lightening striking a telephone pole outside the venue, or some rump-faced runyion saying ""Macbeth"" out loud in the theater and putting a hex on the whole thing.  </p>
<p>However, Theatre Y has an excellent track record of performance durability. Also, over the years we have launched several successful crowd funding campaigns, including one other IndieGogo and two Kickstarter campaigns that were all fully funded and delivered on time!</p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">We will not be bound in to saucy doubts and fears!</span><br/></p>

We open October 19, 2016 at The Chopin Theatre in Chicago. And we need your help to make it happen!
Who are the Theatre Y Ensemble?

Theatre Y is dedicated to the international laboratory with an ever-diversifying group of collaborators from many lands.  To put it succinctly, we seek formidable allies worldwide and we produce work with them.

Over the last ten years, Theatre Y has garnered both critical and public acclaim for our daring and passionate work. Playing to sold-out audiences, Theatre Y's productions feature award-winning actors from the Chicago community and have been highly praised by theatre critics throughout the city. Chicago Stage Review has called Theatre Y's productions ""among the bravest and best of theater in Chicago"", and we have attracted a loyal and discerning audience.
MACBETH will be the first production created by the brand new Theatre Y Ensemble, established and directed by Georges Bigot. To read more about this exciting step in Theatre Y's evolution, visit our ensemble page.
Who is Georges Bigot?
Central to Ariane Mnouchkine’s Theatre du Soleil during the 80’s and 90’s, Georges Bigot is one of France’s most lauded contemporary actors. Known all over the world for highly physical ensemble work, his style reads like “mask in human form that, when turned towards an audience, hits you like a punch in the stomach”, Bigot “lights up our imaginations and overwhelms us even in memory” (Olivier Berardi).



Sixteen years ago, as a student at Northern Illinois University, Theatre Y founder and Artistic Director, Melissa Lorraine, studied with Bigot. ""He was the first to shatter my expectations"" remembers Lorraine. After working with him for one month, she felt ""like I had never performed before; I didn't actually understand anything about the theatre; that I had never seen a real artist on stage until Georges Bigot"". 



Why MACBETH?
To Bigot, MACBETH is ""both a nightmare and a cure"". To be sure, there are witches, ghosts, shrieking owls, and enough stormy weather to make anyone sleep no more, but how can a tragic tale of ruthless ambition, murder, and tyranny be hopeful? ""When we understand that we have escaped from the ugly nightmare, we are so happy we are still alive...we are maybe more [appreciative of] this life and more respectful. It's a medicine from the human soul. For me, Shakespeare wrote a cure"".



As for how we can best tell this nightmare on a very tight budget and in a very intimate space, Mssr. Bigot is blunt: ""We have no choice but to do theatre with everything because we have nothing"". 





""I am so excited to be telling this story with Georges,"" says Lorraine. ""He has a wild and special vision for it, something piercing and vicious. Relentless. I believe Georges tells the truth, demands that everyone around him tells the truth, and that Shakespeare does the same. The two of them put together could create a cocktail that will wake up the masses. This is the hope.""

Why are you taking a full year to produce MACBETH?
Bigot requires full-commitment from the ensemble. We are analyzing the words of William Shakespeare in painstaking detail so we are acting ""at the foot of the letter"", stripping away all pretense and assumptions, looking deep within ourselves, relearning how to walk, talk, dance, and move so we fully embody, not just the characters, but the power, the manipulation, the fear, the paranoia, and the supernatural soliciting they represent. 

""I feel privileged to be a witness to this work"" says Lorraine. ""I feel privileged to be in the room and witness these actors being pushed to a refining, razor's edge"". To put it simply, if the purpose of the typical rehearsal process is to put all the pieces of a production puzzle together, Georges will not allow us to even assemble the puzzle until each piece is meticulously hand-crafted to perfection.

Sounds hard.
It is! But it's also very rewarding. After all, ""the labor we delight in physics pain."" : )
   I want to help! What do you need? Like any good, small, non-profit, art-focused theater company, we are quite adept at getting the most out of every penny we have. We have already been able to pay for Georges' travel and for rehearsal spaces up to this point. But, as this is our most ambitious production in our ten-year history, we hath not foisons enough to fill up our will. 
In order to properly execute Georges Bigot's bold vision for MACBETH, we are asking all art and theatre lovers to consider contributing a total of $10,000. This generous amount will enable us to pay for Georges' future travel and lodging, rehearsal space going forward, costumes, props, set and lighting design, and marketing materials. 
Actors will receive a small stipend that is already budgeted and is not part of this campaign. As Melissa Lorraine testifies: ""This is a real labor of love that Georges has gathered around himself"".
That's a lot of money! What do I get? 
Because learning from and witnessing the dynamic power of Georges Bigot's creative mind is such a special experience, we want to share it with the city and the people of Chicago as much as possible. That is why most of our donation perks include not only complimentary tickets to our production of MACBETH, but also invitations to our September Launch Party with the cast and Georges, special previews and talk-backs, as well as an exclusive reception with Georges.
One very generous donor will be given property in Scotland, and the right to be called a Laird or Lady of Scotland. That's right. For our top donor, we will actually buy you actual land in actual Scotland - 100 square feet of it to be exact - through Highland Titles. Not only will you be able to refer to yourself as a Laird or Lady of Glencoe, but you will also have a tree planted in your honor, camping access to Keil Hill, and you will be helping preserve the lands and wild life of the Scottish Highlands.
Theatre Y is a registered 501(c)(3) non-profit, so any amount you can donate is tax deductible. Your generosity will be forever appreciated by all of us at Theatre Y.

    Are you trying to win us with honest trifles only to betray's in deepest consequence?
Nice one! And never! Live theatre, by it's nature, is unpredictable. We can memorize all our lines, commit blocking to muscle memory, and rehearse a show for an entire year and still be surprised during any given performance. Because this is a performance art, there is always a chance of shows being canceled or dates being postponed due to weather, performer health, lightening striking a telephone pole outside the venue, or some rump-faced runyion saying ""Macbeth"" out loud in the theater and putting a hex on the whole thing.  
However, Theatre Y has an excellent track record of performance durability. Also, over the years we have launched several successful crowd funding campaigns, including one other IndieGogo and two Kickstarter campaigns that were all fully funded and delivered on time!
We will not be bound in to saucy doubts and fears!
When and where does the show run?
We open at The Chopin Theatre on October 19 and run through December 4, 2016. Your contribution will help ensure that this production is as dynamic and gripping as Mssr. Bigot's vision. Visit www.theatre-y.com for all show and ticket information.
   What if I'm not able to donate money at this time? Even if you can't make a financial contribution to our production, please share this campaign with your friends and family across social media. Also, visit the Theatre Y website, Like us on Facebook, join our mailing list, and consider donating your time to help us. We're always looking for good, responsible theatre lovers to help with our shows!",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

</p>
<p>Porpentine is pleased to announce its January 2015 residency
at the Nave Gallery in Somerville, MA, where we will perform Michael Frayn’s <i>Copenhagen</i>. <br/></p>
<p>In <i>Copenhagen, </i>Frayn re-imagines the famous 1941 meeting of physicists Niels
Bohr and Werner Heisenberg, which has been subject to much speculation. Heisenberg was Bohr's finest student and then colleague. His warm relationship with his mentor was damaged beyond repair during this 1941 meeting in Copenhagen. No one knows what exactly the two men discussed. What 
          did Heisenberg believe could be done, and should be done, about atomic 
          bombs? What did he want from Bohr? These questions call up many powerful 
          issues and emotions involving Nazi Germany and nuclear war. <br/></p>
<p>Frayn's <i>Copenhagen</i> revolves around Heisenberg and Bohr's falling out over the moral ramifications of what they have done. The spirits of the two men and Bohr’s wife Margrethe,
meet after death to attempt to answer the question, why did Heisenberg come to Copenhagen? As they debate and
reject possible answers to that question, the conversation addresses nuclear
power and its control, the rationale behind building or not building an atomic
bomb, the uncertainty of the past and the inevitability of the future. </p>
<i>Copenhagen</i> is Porpentine’s second production, following a

<h3>EVERY DOLLAR COUNTS</h3>
<p>Over the past years, we have brought
together over <b>120 </b>students across New York City, <b>95% </b>of which come from the New York City

<p></p>
<p>But at
this point in time, we need YOUR help more than ever!</p>
<p>This year, we hope to raise $5000 for
our scholarship fund. Any additional amount raised will go to either
running our clinics or future scholarship funds. Even if you can spare just a
dollar, your help will contribute to the furthering of our players’ futures.
You will be funding more than just a scholarship, you will be giving inner
city high school students the chance to thrive in a positive environment, grow
as a person and as an athlete, create strong friendships, and open academic
doors. Your donation would be an immense
help as we work to empower our students, and would also provide support for an underrepresented
New York City community and sport.</p>

Part II of this campaign can be found here: https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/aces-inc-s-annual-summer-scholarship-part-ii/x/6936380. Thank you to everyone who contributed to Round I of our campaign. So far, we have raised around $3000, through Indiegogo and outside means. This means we still have $2000 left to raise! Who are we?ACES Inc. Academy for Comprehensive
Excellence and Scholarship is a nonprofit organization
that provides New York City high school students with the
skills necessary to turn an interest in under-represented extracurricular
activities, specifically New York City street handball, into a means of
attaining higher education opportunities. 
What do we do?For the past two years, we have run a summer program in parks across New York City, offering free eight hour-long handball clinics twice a week, while providing snacks, drinks, training, mentorship, handball equipment, and tournaments to our attendees. 


At the end of each summer, we host a tournament which award a total of $5,000 in scholarship money to the winners. This money can only be collected after the players graduate and provide proof of admission into a college/university, a technical institution, or any other approved institution of higher education. 


The success of this program has been accomplished by a dedicated staff of qualified athletic coaches, academic mentors, and volunteers who pride themselves in creating a safe and fun learning environment where both athletic and personal growth can be fostered.






Our Community

The community we serve is made up of
high school students who generally hail from
working-class to lower middle-class neighborhoods in Brooklyn and Queens. 



They
practice handball day and night to improve their game, putting hours of blood,
sweat, and tears onto the courts. 




However, due to its status as a street sport,
handball has not received as much funding from foundations or universities,
despite being such a quintessential part of New York City. Because of this,
scholarship opportunities for handball players are scarce to nonexistent, making
it difficult for students to transform their passion for handball into further
academic development, an opportunity often afforded to basketball and football
players.

EVERY DOLLAR COUNTS

together over 120 students across New York City, 95% of which come from the New York City

<p>Help jump-start and save KENTUCKY STAGE(S) spectacular
2014-15 season!</p>
<p>Kentucky Stage(s) is Southern Kentucky’s Equity Professional
Regional Theatre in residence at the Southern Kentucky Performing Arts Center
(SKyPAC.)</p>
<p>Our great first season included “The Lion in Winter” with
guest artist Andrew Prine, “The Glass Menagerie” (in honor of our inspiration,
regional actor and force of nature, Pat Taylor), “Working: a Musical,” “The
Importance of Being Earnest,” and “Lombardi.”</p>
<p>We’ve planned an exceptional second season: “A Streetcar
Named Desire” opens September 25, followed by Neil Simon’s “Laughter on the 23<sup>rd</sup>
Floor,” “A Kentucky Christmas Carol,” “The Mystery of Irma Vep,” and the
astonishing musical that takes place in our own back yard, “Floyd Collins.” For
more details on the season and dates, check us out on our web page, <a href=""http://www.kentuckystages.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>www.kentuckystages.org</u></a> OR our Facebook
Page.</p>
<p>Kentucky Stage(s) fills a vacuum left by the loss of the
region’s former professional theatre and, indeed, was formed out of the company
that bound together to make a daring turn-around there. While the results there
were astounding, years of financial issues caused the theatre management to
close its doors. The core of the last-year turn-around, however, formed a new
company and found a new home at the new SKyPAC. Stage(s) is one of two resident
companies at SKyPAC, the other being Orchestra Kentucky. </p>
<p>In ONE YEAR, we have established working relations with
Actors Equity Association and with SDC, the union of stage directors and
choreographers in the US. AEA has supported us to such an extent that we can,
this year, offer Equity membership candidate “points,” a way for actors and
stage managers new to the business, to work their way into the union. This
particular aspect of the relationship was granted a full year ahead of the
developmental schedule. What does that do for the SoKY area? Where the area is
rich is in the educational theatre resources…at least three groups for young
performers and an amazingly regarded university program grace Bowling Green. A
number of well-known theatre professionals have come through here. Besides
offering a chance to see professional work in our own home-town, Stage(s) now
offers a great new door-way into the profession itself.</p>
<p>As is well known, funding for theatre of any kind,
especially when at a professional level, is crucial. Very few theatres are able
to survive on ticket sales alone. While we spent the first year establishing
our company and molding it artistically, the bills were footed by the personal
support of our Executive Director, Craig Taylor. He, obviously, cannot continue
that, so the search for funding began.</p>
<p>Now, the exasperating part…. </p>
<p>An expected piece of funding did not materialize and the shortfall
has endangered the very existence of the second season and we need your help
NOW! This campaign is a short-term (5-day) jump-start to help save the first
show, “A Streetcar Named Desire” now and help us keep the ball rolling while we
really hit the funding road… HARD! (look for the upcoming events: “The Stella
Yell-aah” and “Full Bunny Contact.”</p>
<p>While we are still in the process of establishing ourselves
as a non-profit organization, we are under the fiscal sponsorship of the
amazing Fractured Atlas, which is an “umbrella” non-profit organization. Larger
contributors can help us with a tax deductible contribution there. For

<h3>The Play:</h3>
<p><i>I and You </i>is a complex, touching, funny, and extremely moving story of two 17-year olds brought together by very unique circumstances.   Caroline is very sick.   Her liver is failing.   She has been pulled out of school and is confined to her room.   Anthony is a classmate of hers that she barely knows.   He comes over unannounced to work on a class project -- for which they have been apparently paired -- about Walt Whitman.    What happens between them in this 95 minutes is life changing.   </p>
<p>The play's author, Lauren Gunderson, is currently the most produced playwright in the United States and yet somehow, remains unknown to a vast majority of Canadian theatregoers.   This production will change that, and in a big way.</p>
<h3>The Company: </h3>
<ul>
<li>Outlook Theatre is a not-for-profit and project-based theatre company that has been in existence since 2015.</li>
<li>It was founded and is led by Artistic Director, Marc Bondy (who will also direct <i>I and You</i>)</li>
<li>It receives no annual operating funding from any level of government </li>
<li>
<i>I and You</i> will be Outlook Theatre's first full-scale independent production.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>With no support from our Government Funding Bodies (Toronto Arts Council, Ontario Arts Council and Canada Council) we rely on crowdfunding, in-kind donations, ticket revenue and sponsorships from the private sector in order to meet our production expenses.   <i><strong>I and You </strong></i>- our current project -- has a total production expense of $26,500. </p>
<p>Outlook Theatre is committed to <i>paying all artists involved a living wage</i>.   In fact, it is part of our mission to help launch emerging artists without asking them to work for free.    Artistic Fees for this project will amount to $13,500.   All <i>other</i> production expenses amount to $13,000.  Projected box-office revenue is expected to be $13,000.  As of January 1st 2018, Outlook Theatre has secured $1000 from the private sector by way of sponsorships and we have also secured in-kind contributions totalling $1200.    In addition, I will be donating my directing salary back to the production ($3000) as a personal contribution because I believe so heavily in this project.</p>
<p>We are setting a crowdfunding goal of $9000 for this campaign to cover the short-fall ($8300 plus $700 for Indiegogo platform fees). </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your dollars will be used to create a living, breathing piece of live theatre that has the power to inspire and move all who experience it.   And it will bring this incredible play to Toronto audiences for the <i>first time</i>.    Moreover, you will play a part in providing an ever-so-gentle nudge forward in the early stages of careers of some very fine emerging artists.     </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest risk in putting this production on independently is going into debt should we not raise the funds we need to cover our projected revenue shortfall.   Outlook Theatre is committed to this production and to paying all the artists involved.   We will not pull the plug on this production no matter what.   So a failure to cover our production expenses will result in company debt (which we would very much like to avoid).</p>
<p>As theatre artists, one of our greatest challenges is finding ways to engage younger theatre audiences so that we can build the audiences of tomorrow.  We are constantly searching for ways to develop young people's interest in the theatre and keep them coming back for the next 50+ years.    This play appeals specifically to young people and it will get their bums in seats.  It is written in their vernacular and about things that resonate with them.   We believe the best way to engage a new audience is to allow them to see themselves reflected on stage.   <i> I and You </i>does that, brilliantly.   This story will appeal to people who already go the theatre while at the same time appealing to younger, first-time theatregoers.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you cannot contribute to our campaign financially, there are more ways to show your support and to help us reach our goal:</p>
<ul>
<li>Help us get the word out and make some noise about our campaign by sharing it within your networks.   You can do this easily by using the Indiegogo ""share"" tools right here on the site</li>
<li>Buy tickets.   Make an early commitment to come and see the show by purchasing an advance ticket and marking your calendar.</li>
<li>Make an in-kind contribution<ul>
<li>Have access to printing equipment and supplies?   Offer to print our posters, postcards or tickets for free</li>
<li>Volunteer to usher one of our performances</li>
<li>Dabble in photography?   Volunteer to take some publicity or production stills for us to use in promotion of the show.</li>
<li>Have contacts in the media?   Help us to get a preview article in The Toronto Star, Globe &amp; Mail, Now Magazine or a radio interview on CBC Radio</li>
<li>Are you teacher?   Buy a block tickets for your class for our student matinee on April 25th.   </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</div><p>We cannot wait to bring this amazing play to audiences in Toronto this spring.    Please help us to make a big splash by supporting our campaign.    Thank you in advance for your interest and your support of Outlook Theatre's <i>I and You.</i></p></div>","The Play:

As theatre artists, one of our greatest challenges is finding ways to engage younger theatre audiences so that we can build the audiences of tomorrow.  We are constantly searching for ways to develop young people's interest in the theatre and keep them coming back for the next 50+ years.    This play appeals specifically to young people and it will get their bums in seats.  It is written in their vernacular and about things that resonate with them.   We believe the best way to engage a new audience is to allow them to see themselves reflected on stage.    I and You does that, brilliantly.   This story will appeal to people who already go the theatre while at the same time appealing to younger, first-time theatregoers.

</h3> <p>Building Better People Productions is an Annapolis. MD- based theater that does shows for kids and families, featuring professional actors, that are all about respect and kindness and other good things. It was started in the fall of 2015 by Lynne Streeter Childress, an actor, teaching artist and director who has been in the theater world in some shape or form for over 20 years, and has worked at cool places like the Kennedy Center, Arena Stage, and the Folger Shakespeare Library. Much of that work has been for, with, and also sometimes playing, children (like in the world premiere and original tour of  the musical adaptation of the classic children's book, ""Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day""). Now she is branching out on her own, and here is why: <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Lynne spends a lot of time on Facebook, and in internet comment sections, and could not ignore that we are living in a time of open disrespect and empathy towards other people, especially those with different ideas than you. She wanted to do something, and was led to write pieces for kids that showed the beauty of self-worth and kindness, because theater is a powerful way to influence, and youth is a great time to be influenced for good. And that's where BBP Productions came from, and </span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">here is what we are doing!</span></p>

<p>If you help fund our campaign, you will be building Building Better People!

<p></p></div>","Short SummaryStained Glass Theatre Joplin seeks to provide training, resources, and opportunity for individuals in our community to identify, develop, and utilize the gifts God has given them for “family friendly” artistic expression.

In addition to family friendly theater productions, SGT Joplin cultivates an environment for the community to explore and develop interest in artistic areas. While developing interest and ability in the arts, SGT Joplin provides opportunity for relation-ships to be strengthened, both within the community of SGT Joplin volunteers, and in the broader community as well.

Excellent productions, supportive and encouraging community life, and exposure to training and experience from like-minded artists are all hallmarks of the work of SGT Joplin.

<p>SLaM: the Hockey Rock Opera is based on a true story. This original musical started when my boyfriend and I were travelling around Europe. He was trying to play division 1 hockey, after having no success in Canada. We had both been battered by the US border, post 9/11, and in Europe we could be together, border free. But travelling has its own challenges, and when I started singing about our struggles in Mora, Sweden, my boyfriend turned on a digital recorder and caught it all live.</p>
<p>After recording 19 songs acapella, I found an orchestrator in Montpelier, Vermont. Together we turned it into a full fledged musical.</p>
<p>The show was produced by Green Mountain Theater Group in October, 2010, to great reviews.</p>

<p>I kept working on this fledgling show, and it was accepted into an inaugural festival this summer in upstate New York. We get to ""Pitch"" the show, to industry professionals, with the goal of a full production.</p>
<p>I found a New York City professional dramaturg, Charlie Schulman, and a new accompianist, Sheila Metcalf, and together we are building an amazing production.</p>
<p>The leading male, Silky la Mouche, will be played by James Blanchard. James has performed in musical theater all across his native Vermont. Credits include leading roles with Lyric Theatre, one of the country's largest all-volunteer theater groups, and Vermont Stage Company, the only professional, resident theater in Burlington, VT. He also hosts ""Musical Theater in the Green Mountains"", a weekly radio program focusing on local theater music, on The Radiator, 105.9 WOMM (<a href=""http://theradiator.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">theradiator.org</a>.). He can be seen next in Sweeney Todd, with the Stowe Theatre Guild. James is proud to help bring this Vermont-born musical to a wider audience.</p>
<p>I'll be playing the female lead, Steamy Rika, who is based on me.  It is definitely strange to play a version of yourself on stage, but no one believes in this project more than I do - so who better to ""Sell It"".</p>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/045/204/80b742f3d7d909d1319a38897ded0a66_large.jpg?1340721879"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<p>Sheila, our Narrator and pianist is a creative and inspiring talent to work with and help guide SLaM musically to this next level.  She received her B.A. in music from Johnson State College in 2002. After an early start working in musical theater (The Rocky Horror Show, The Fantasticks, Jesus Christ Superstar, Hair) she turned her attention to the singer/songwriter areas of music. The last decade has been filled with teaching piano, writing and performing with eclectic projects and musicians in the beauty of New England.  She is pleased to return to the setting of the theater to be part of this production of SLaM.</p>
<p>Our first full production, back in 2010, of a new show that no one had ever heard of received great reviews all over the state, and got mentioned in The <a href=""http://slamthehockeyrockopera.com/blog/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">New York Times</a>, USA Today, and crazy random places like The Bombay Times and The Beijing Times.</p>
<p>People still come up to me and ask for downloads of the songs that they can't stop humming.</p>
<p>Nothing like this show has ever been done before. This has real potential to make it all the way to Broadway! And with your help - we can surely do it!</p>

He also hosts ""Musical Theater in the Green Mountains"", a weekly radio program focusing on local theater music, on The Radiator, 105.9 WOMM (theradiator.org.). He can be seen next in Sweeney Todd, with the Stowe Theatre Guild. James is proud to help bring this Vermont-born musical to a wider audience.
I'll be playing the female lead, Steamy Rika, who is based on me.  It is definitely strange to play a version of yourself on stage, but no one believes in this project more than I do - so who better to ""Sell It"".

Sheila, our Narrator and pianist is a creative and inspiring talent to work with and help guide SLaM musically to this next level.  She received her B.A. in music from Johnson State College in 2002. After an early start working in musical theater (The Rocky Horror Show, The Fantasticks, Jesus Christ Superstar, Hair) she turned her attention to the singer/songwriter areas of music. The last decade has been filled with teaching piano, writing and performing with eclectic projects and musicians in the beauty of New England.  She is pleased to return to the setting of the theater to be part of this production of SLaM.
Our first full production, back in 2010, of a new show that no one had ever heard of received great reviews all over the state, and got mentioned in The New York Times, USA Today, and crazy random places like The Bombay Times and The Beijing Times.
People still come up to me and ask for downloads of the songs that they can't stop humming.
Nothing like this show has ever been done before. This has real potential to make it all the way to Broadway! And with your help - we can surely do it!",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

What is unique about our approach is that we will be incorporating the improvisational moments discovered in our explorations of the original Chekhov play, which is in and of itself very brief. These explorations will be adding moments to the One Act play, thereby expanding the piece into a full length play. The additional scenes will consist of circumstances outside the original plot, discovered through the actor’s personal realities.</p>
<p>Beyond the stage version of the play, we anticpate creating a film version of our process of The Bear. This is the Final Goal of the project - a screenplay adaptation developed from the one act play, to be shot in Romania, incorporating additional scenes and Chekhovian characters. The work thus far at the Actors Studio is seen as a first step towards that goal. First, to rehearse and perform the play as a core, and then to begin to bring in other scene ideas and characters, such as a funeral scene and a church confessional scene. The objective of this first step is to develop a full length play out of the one act, with the imaginary circumstances arising out of the personal lives of the actors, but still within the context of the play.  </p>
<p>Your generous donations will allow us to fully realize an expanded rehearsal process that will include your participation, to further develop connections between the audience and the actors.

<h3>Meet Passed Dance</h3>
<p>Passed Dance is a small modern dance company in a large art-filled city. Despite having had no funding, amidst a crumbling economy, in a society that often fails to support dance with the same vigor as visual arts, music, and theater...we survived our first year! Personal ups and downs sprinkled with a few fights during the rehearsal process couldn't even keep us down. We have shown our work in Manhattan, Brooklyn, and the Bronx. We went on an artistic retreat at the Dragon's Egg in Mystic, CT. And we received the PILLAR Choreography Residency at BODYART Studio in Queens, NY. All in all, not bad for a small group of women dedicated to making their mark on the world through dance.</p>
<p>We are embarking on our second year by creating a new lighthearted piece, <i>We Didn't Win the Lotto...But We Still Enjoyed the View</i>, a reminder to stay in the moment, keep spontaneity alive, laugh, play, and enjoy the company of those we love. We are also continuing work on our evening length collection of pieces inspired by therapeutic work done with the acutely mentally ill, <i>Behind Locked Doors</i>.</p>
</div><div><p><br/></p></div><div>
<h3>Our Goal and How You Can Help</h3>
<div>In our second year we are attempting to do something that is virtually unheard of for a small dance company that receives no major funding - pay our dancers for their hours of hard work and dedication. We are asking for your help in achieving this goal, along with aiding us in offsetting the high cost of studio rental fees for rehearsals, costuming for our new work, and a new photo shoot for marketing and promotional materials. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>No donation is too small...every dollar helps us offset the high cost of producing high quality dance in New York City. Just $1 pays a dancer for 5 minutes of rehearsal time (or buys her a Luna bar to keep her stamina up). No donation is too large either. If you won the lotto or pulled your money out of the stock market before it crashed and are now hoarding money under your mattress we can help ease your burden of figuring out how to invest that money.<br/>

<h3>The History</h3>
<div class=""entry-content"">
<p>In 2010, On The Square Productions mounted a production of <em>A Midsummer Night’s Dream</em> in a private Astoria greenspace. This production was successful in many ways, but the support and encouragement from local businesses and community members was perhaps the most important. One evening as the show started cast, crew, and audience noticed two local children transfixed by the action. The two were watching through a parking lot fence positioned above the playing area. These neighborhood children had stumbled upon a magical event practically in their backyard. This moment inspired the company to replicate that magic on a broader scale. In order to make this experiment more accessible, OtSP created this program free of charge, and set their sights on found spaces seemingly commonplace to all. So The Astoria Free Theatre Project was born.</p>
<div>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The Astoria Free Theatre Project is a bi-annual theatre production produced by On The Square Productions.  As producers who not only work, but live in Astoria, Jackie LaVanway and Rachel McPhee-Benson have identified a need for free, professional theatre in their neighborhood.</p>
<p><em>The Minervae </em>tells the story of one mythological goddess who refuses to move over for the fashionable new “cult” of Christianity. Jilted, Minerva sets out to re-convert the converted. Standing in her way are the schemes of the other Olympians: bitter Vulcan, volatile Mars, ambitious Apollo, and the enigmatic Diana. It’s a titanic clash of faith vs. revelation, with mortal Man caught in between.</p>
<div class=""entry-content"">
<p>The aim of this project is to bring a free, professional piece of new writing to an Astoria found space biannually. The Astoria Free Theatre Project will make its debut with Steven Bost's <em>The Minervae</em> in July 2012. This event is made possible in part by the Queens Council on the Arts with public funding from the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs.</p>

<h3 class=""_mce_tagged_br"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We've set our sights high for <em>The Minervae</em> with a project goal of $5,000.  Because our show is free of charge we cannot depend on recouping some of our funds from ticket sales; so are coming up with some creative ways to raise capital!  With your genrous donation to On the Square Productions you'll be helping to make the following possible:</p>
<ul>
<li>Printing of scripts for our actors, and programs for our patrons</li>
<li>The beautiful costumes and set pieces that will create Mount Olympus and the post-catastrophic world of the Christians</li>
<li>Non-traditional theatrical lighting fixtures that will help set the tone and atmosphere of our world</li>
<li>Musical instruments - we will purchase drums and acquire other intruments to enhance our storytelling</li>
<li>Load in/Load out costs- we'll  have to rent a vehicle to deliver and disassemble our set and costumes</li>
<li>Stipends for Artists, Crew, and Designers- people donate so much of their time in the arts, and while a great deal of independent theatre is on a volunteer basis, it's very important for us to pay our artists</li>
<li>Advertising costs- you can help us raise money for us to generate marketing tools so we can promote our show to the very best of our ability</li>

<li>And many many more things!</li>
</ul>
<div>If we don't make our $5000 goal, we have some backup plans that would involve scaling back on some of our advertising and production costs.

</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>It may sound cliche to say, but every dollar helps.  A donation of $5 can cover an actor's script or a can of spray paint. $20 buys an hour of rehearsal space, and $100 makes up 20% of our entire costume budget!  Any donation, no matter how big or small, means a infinite number of possibilities- especially when you have a creative team as talented as the ones we've assembled!  We couldn't be more pleased with this throught provoking, intelligent, magical piece of theatre we'll be presenting this July.  To be able to provide this type of programming free to our neighbors in the place where we live is an incredibly rewarding feeling.  We hope to inspire young minds and change people's perception of a theatrical event.  Theatre is magical- it can happen any where at any moment, if you just look around.  We'd love to share our magical world with you this July 2012 in Athens Square Park.</p>

<p>Thank you for taking the time to read more about this exciting new project.  My name is Kellie Hodges and I'm seeking your investment for my work as a choreographer.  I graduated with a BA in dance from Point Park University and went on to dance professionally in Chicago with Thodos Dance Chicago.  My work has been a part of the company's repertoire since 2008, performing in Chicago, touring through Alaska, at the Busan International Dance Festival, and at Jacob's Pillow.  For the past 3 and a half years I have been teaching jazz at Point Park University as an adjunct instructor.  The opportunity has enabled me to cultivate my teaching methods and theory of dance.  With this cultivation I have been able to further my development of my own choreography as well.  I have choreographed a wide span of works ranging from flashmobs to work performed at Point Park University's Pittsburgh Connections.  Most recently my work received 3rd place in the International Choreography Competition hosted by the Jazz Dance World Congress in August 2012.  In an effort to continue moving forward I have submitted a new work and been accepted to Peridance's Showcase at APAP (the Association of Performing Arts Presenters) in January of 2013.  Your contribution would allow my work to be seen by arts presenters, agencies and managers from all over the world.  In order to present my work I must raise $950 in 7 days.  This will provide publicity including press releases and media exposure while also covering theater and technical fees.  The opportunity to showcase my choreography in the company of the many talented artists that APAP hosts is priceless and would give me exposure to achieve my goals as an artist.  Your donation would be so valuable to the continuation of showcases for emerging artists.  If the goal is not met, all the contributions will still go towards the sponsorship.  THANK YOU for your time and consideration.  Check out a video of the work on the link above.  Please feel free to share this with any arts supporters and lovers.  I am sincerely thankful to all my supporters.  Anything helps.  Keep the arts alive and growing!

<div>Hi! I'm Emily, a senior at the Rhose Island School of Design in Providence, Rhode Island. I have been developing my thesis over the past several months and am turning it into an outdoor performance in the College Hill area of Providence. The piece involves involves elements of</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>puppet theatre</li>
<li>toy theatre,</li>
<li>mask work</li>
<li>music and</li>
<li>live actors, among other things.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>The piece is based around the events of the Conquest of Mexico and the fall of the city of Tenochtitlán, with it's primary focus on the role of La Malinche . La Malinche (although she has many names: Malintzin, Malinali, Doña Marina, La Chingada), was a Nahua woman who was given to the Spanish conquistadors as a slave and who eventually became an advisor and translator to Hernan Cortés.</div>
<div>
<p>As someone of Latin American heritage, I feel both complicit in and, in a way, a victim of the horrors of the Conquest of Mexico and want to deal with:</p>
<ul>
<li>the nature of Malinche's relationship with Cortés which is oftnen treated as a pseudodromantic Pocahontas/John Smith relationship</li>
<li>Malinche's serving a dual role as both the 'mother' of modern Mexico and a scapegoat for all of the atrocities of the Conquest of Mexico</li>
<li>her relationship to the Virgin of Guadalupe.</li>
</ul>
<p>I also want to bring this story briefly into the present and tie La Malinche to  the thousands of modern women working in the Maquilas set up on the border.</p>
<p>The <strong>funding</strong> we need will go to costumes, set pieces and propos (some handmade and some purchased) that will really bring life to the piece. We are not sponsored by a studen organization so have no base funding but want so desperately to get the message of this piece and it's exploration of history out to the public.</p>
<p>I really believe that<strong> this piece will have an impact</strong> on both the college community and the public who are interested to come and watch it. Tickets are free because to us, this isn't about making money, it's about creating awareness but unfortunately, we need some funding to go about doing that in the first place.</p>
<p>The first received funding will go into the making of the costumes and props that we have designs for and if we do not reach our entire goal, the props we intended on buying, we will figure out a different way to create their effect in the show.</p>
<p>As well as funding, we would love your time and interest. Having an audience to receive, process and get talking about information and the events of the piece is more important that just how loud a crowd of people is clapping. Please spread the word about both the physical show and the Indiegogo campaign through Indiegogo's share tools.</p>

<h3>Hello and welcome to my campaign</h3>
<p>Hi I'm Solomon, I'm 17 and a dancer from Brighton, England. I am honoured to have been offered a place at the prestigious contemporary dance school P.A.R.T.S.(Performing Arts Training and Research Studios) in Belgium starting this September 2013 for 3 years. The school conducted auditions in 23 countries and over 1000 people auditioned for just 50 places! I feel priveledged to have been selected for professional training, and one year before the minimum age requirement. I however cannot take up this place without your support and fulfil my dream to become a professional dancer.</p>

</div>
<div> </div>
<h3><strong>What I need from you</strong></h3>
<p>I have to raise £7,500 and with your contribution you will allow me to take up my place at P.A.R.T.S. by paying for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Course fees and registration  £6500</li>
<li>Setting myself up in Belgium and living costs for the first month £1000</li>
</ul><p></p>
<p>No contribution is too small. Every pound counts and will be much appreciated. Studying outside the UK I am not eligible for a student loan from Student Finance England. It will be such a shame and soul-destroying to be deprived of this rare opportunity solely due to having no financial support.

<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The rigorous and holistic training programme at P.A.R.T.S. and access to the world's most established and recognised dance artists will undoubtedly give me an advantage in the highly competitive dance world. For the last 4 years and since the age of 13 I have spent up to 6 days a week travelling the 4 hour round trip to London for training, rehearsals and performances and it is this drive and dedication that has got me to where I am now.  Your investment in me at this key point in my development will help me to become part of the inspiring dance talent that comes out of P.A.R.T.S.</p>

<p>For 20 years City of Angels Ballet has offered free ballet classes to children from underserved communities. City of Angels Ballet has worked with over 35,000 children from the Los Angeles Unified School District at no cost to the schools, the city or the children’s families. City of Angels Ballet has been featured on <em>CBS Sunday Morning</em>, <em>LatiNation</em>, an <em>Emmy</em> nominated piece by the <em>Los Angeles City Channel</em>, the <em>Los Angeles</em> <em>Times,</em> and numerous other local news programs. Our children have performed at the Los Angeles Music Center, the Orange County Performing Arts Center, Universal Amphitheater and the Japan American Center. Additionally, the children give back to the community by performing at Children’s Hospital, at an AIDS fundraiser in Riverside, CA and at local schools, community festivals and outreach performances to invited audiences of over 6,000 other children and the elderly.</p>
<p>The Founder and Artistic Director of the City of Angels Ballet, Mario Nugara was trained at the School of American Ballet, the official school of the New York City Ballet.

He has taught in the United States and Europe on the professional, university and student level.</p>
<p><strong>THE</strong> <strong>NEXT STEP:</strong></p>
<p>We continue to pull talented youth from some of the most underserved communities in Los Angeles and offer opportunities to the children through City of Angels Ballet's outreach programs. Children from the City of Angels Ballet School are immersed into a professional dance setting and often receive opportunities to perform alongside professional ballet dancers from the City of Angels Ballet. As these children develop an affinity for dance a door opens into a new world full of possibilities. 98% of our students at the City of Angels Ballet School are on full scholarship. The City of Angels Ballet School is the <em>only</em> not-for-profit ballet school in Los Angeles focused exclusively on developing and producing exceptional ballet dancers.</p>

<br/>Summary</h3>
<p>Hello! My name is Alexandra and I am a ballet dancer from San Francisco. I began ballet when I was 3 and entered pre-professional training when I was 10. I’ve trained in San Francisco, New York City, and in Moscow, Russia at the Bolshoi Ballet Academy. This summer I trained in Finland with the famed Vaganova Academy of Ballet from St. Petersburg. In addition to my artistic skills, I am fluent in Russian and hold a B.A. in Slavic Languages and Literatures from University of California, Santa Barbara and a Kathryn Davis Fellowship for Peace from Middlebury College. I’ve had a wide array of experiences and endured many challenges that have prepared me to take on the professional world of ballet. I’m ready!<br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1481860634/bsjnjadrknnhwcjq2gaw.png"" src="""" style=""""/><br/>This campaign is very important to me, because more than just dedication and talent go into the process of being accepted to a company; finances play a huge role to pull this off. These last several months I have been working part-time, in addition to my daily hours of training. I fully funded my training program in Finland, as well as travel there and back. I have also been fully responsible for all ballet-related expenses this last year. I have been dedicating everything I have to this endeavor, but the last few months have been more difficult in terms of expenses, as I upped my training load significantly these last several months. The more I train, the less time I have to work to earn money to pay for training..  <br/>Contributors will help me to achieve so much!

As I hear back from companies responding to my submissions, I will find out whether or not they are interested in me as a potential company member. If so, I fly off to whatever city in whatever country the company is in and audition for them in person. I anticipate that January and February will involve lots of international travel and, of course, expenses. </p>
<p>Thank you for your consideration!</p>
</div><div>
<h3><strong>How Will the Money Be Used?</strong></h3>
<p>My fundraising goal is to raise $10,000. This money will cover my day-to-day training costs, as well as audition-specific expenses, through February 2017. I've laid out details below to give a better understanding of how much certain things cost. And remember- there are special perks for all levels of donations!<br/><br/>Costs of training expenses:</p>
<p>$100/hr.- Private training with ballet coaches for technique, pointe, variations</p>
<p>$95- Pointe shoes</p>
<p>$8- Open ballet class</p>

<p>$75/class.- Rhythmic gymnastics cross training</p>
<p>$50/appointment- Acupuncture </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Audition-specific expenses:</p>
<p>$1,300- Photo shoot for audition photos to send to companies</p>
<p>$200- Makeup artist for photo shoot</p>
<p>$350- Roundtrip flight to NYC from SF for photo shoot</p>
<p>$175/session- Videographer for audition variations </p>
<p>$TBD- Roundtrip plane flights to the companies in US/Europe that I get accepted to audition at</p>
<p>$TBD- Room and board while auditioning January-February </p>
<h3><strong>If I Raise Less?</strong></h3>
<p>What will I do if I receive less than $10,000? I will continue with my audition and training plans and use the funds allotted to me to cover the most expenses that I can. The rest I will figure out myself, as I have been doing. I will be in some credit card debt, but it will be worth it to achieve my lifelong goal. </p>
<h3><strong>If I Raise More? </strong></h3>
<p>$10,000 is the amount estimated to cover my training and audition expenses through February, but my work doesn't end there! Even after the audition process is complete and I have signed a contract with a company to begin dancing at in the fall, I will be working hard to improve in my field and prepare for my transition to the professional world. There are also a few activities that I would like to add to my regular training schedule and extra money would go towards paying for these.<br/>These include: additional Pilates coaching, 10-series Zen Bodytherapy TM and Structural Integration, and One on One Prime Sport Coaching with Dr. Jim Taylor. <br/>There is also one coach of mine who has been training me absolutely for free!!! He believes in me so much and has dedicated so much time and energy to my improvement and has never asked for anything in return, other than my hard work and dedication. I would love to surprise him with a gift of $1,000 for Christmas to express my thanks (along with a signed company contract soon too!).</p>
</div><div>
<h3><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></h3>
<p>Of course, there are no guarantees in this competitive audition process or in the subjective ballet-world in general.

<ul>
<li>Spread the word! <strong>Please share this campaign on Facebook, Instagram, and other social media, email it to friends and family, and share with the performing arts community and dance philanthropists.</strong> The Indiegogo share tools make this a piece of cake!</li>

This new twist on The Velveteen Rabbit has a resounding emphasis on the importance of play. In the show, the title character, the Velveteen Rabbit is quickly passed over by 'The Boy', and is tossed aside for more high-tech toys like iPads. One day the Boy begins to play with his Velveteen Rabbit again and they go on many imaginary adventures together. From their adventures traveling to outer space to deep-sea diving, the audience witnesses how using one’s imagination has no limits.Spark’s newest addition to its annual performances is Spark Collections of Change, a biannual performance series featuring choreography by past and present company dancers created around a theme. The premiere performances will include all original works centering around the concept of change. Spark’s creative process heavily involves each dancer’s creative voice, and Spark Collections of Change will give dancers the opportunity take on leadership roles as choreographers and guide the creative process.For the past seven years, Spark has achieved its mission of providing accessible dance experiences due in large part to the generosity of family, friends, and patrons.

<p><span>We are creating a new piece of theater using poems, plays, short stories and other texts by the grand dame of American wit, Dorothy Parker. Ms. Parker portrays the human condition with great humor and compassion. She is shrewd in her observations of men and women and she delights in the absurd and the everyday. We will relate her insight to our contemporary life. We will wrestle with her texts to form a dynamic theatrical experience. </span></p>
<p> This piece will dive into questions about:</p>
<p><span>—isolation and alienation</span></p>
<p><span>—facing the void (existence)</span></p>
<p><span>—the need for love and connection</span></p>
<p><span>—male-female relationships</span></p>
<p><span>—the confines of societal codes</span></p>
<p><span>—the human voice</span></p>
<p> Our process is highly collaborative—a big, juicy artistic stew. We begin with <strong>investigation</strong>: solo and also as a group. We will generate our ideas practically and cerebrally. We will work on our feet. We will get messy with art. We will throw out ideas and images and possible avenues. And we will shave them and hone them into a collective vision that is our springboard. The <strong>exploration</strong> of this vision is the meat of our process. We will ask a lot of questions. We will test our ideas, sculpt moments, and rigorously explore of our artistic impulses. We will craft an experience for an audience and <strong>share</strong> this creation. Dialogue with an audience is an opportunity for us to learn how our piece functions and see avenues for further development.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><span><em>How are you doing it?</em></span></h3>
<p><span>We will begin our investigation in a 5-day residency at the <strong>Dragon's Egg </strong>in Mystic, Ct. There we will dive into the pile of texts with wild abandon dividing our time between dramaturgical and physical explorations. After that, we head into a 6-day residency at <strong>Dartmouth College</strong>, sponsored by <strong>VOX Theater </strong>(<a href=""http://www.voxtheater.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.voxtheater.org</a>),<strong> </strong>which will culminate in a public workshop performance and feedback session. In May 2013, we will return to Dartmouth College to perform the first draft of our new piece in VOX Theater’s inaugural <strong>VOX Fest</strong> at the Hopkins Center. </span></p>

I've been directing for ten years this September, and I'm thrilled to be making my mark on NYC a decade later with this thrilling revival with Cupcake Lady Productions.</p><p>Hazelwood Jr. High is a very special play to me. It's not done a lot, and I'm really thrilled to be bringing it back to New York since its original production in 1998. I found out about it through stalking Chloe Sevigny's Wikipedia page a few years ago (she played Laurie in the original production). I was fascinated by the play's description, so I ordered a copy online and the rest is history. Rob (Urbinati, the playwright) has been so incredibly supportive and resourceful as has Cupcake Lady Productions and my AD/SM, Sean I've really lucked out. While certainly the story of Shanda Sharer is without a doubt completely devastating, it's one I think the public needs to remember. We need to be able to talk about teen sexuality and LGBT issues with adolescences in and outside of the classrooms. As serial killer Aileen Wuornos once said, ""if you can't be a good example at least be a terrible warning."" This play is a terrible warning of what happens when parents, teachers and legal counselors look the other way when they don't know how to deal with these issues. </p><p>I came out as a gay person starting when I was 13--though not officially til I was 14. It's a hard time to know who you are that young, though I think it saved me a lot of grief in the long run. I see a lot of myself and my peers in these girls. They're just trying to have agency in a world that keeps telling them no and that they're not old enough. For the most part, they know who they are and who they want to be. But they're just having trouble getting from point A to point B. This production is going to be different--we're going to be fully immersed in the world of these young girls. I don't want to give too much away, but I can tell you this story has never been staged quite in this way before. It's very exciting.</p><p>Also, because giving back to our community is important to me, thanks to Mayday Space (where the show is being held) we are presenting the show as an admission-free event with suggested donations to benefit the Ali Forney Center for Homeless LGBT Youth. Because of this, Cupcake Lady Productions is hosting this as a charity production to benefit this cause.

""Nothing to be done""

Two tramps, Vladimir and Estragon, are waiting in the evening for a man named Godot.  Suddenly, Pozzo and Lucky arrive! 
One of the most famous plays ever written in the history of theater! Over years the absurd ""Waiting for Godot"" written by Samuel Beckett has followed me with his poetry, atmosphere and humanity. An experience between comedy and tragedy where the everyday futilities help us to wait for changes to come. 

Welcome : 

Hi everyone, 

Welcome to our Project!  My name is Mathilde Schennen.  I am a belgian actress who has been living in New York for one year.  I came to the City to study at the Lee Strasberg Film and Theater Institute where I met wonderful actors and my future cast for our production of the play ""Waiting for Godot"", written by Samuel Beckett .  First, I started out working on the play as an directing exercise but then I realized quickly that I couldn't stop dreaming about it. Therefore I decided  to produce the entire play.  Since the end of summer I have been directing my wonderful cast in the masterpiece “Waiting for Godot” which will perform in November 2011 at the Kraine Theater.



Who we are : 
We are an international team, coming from Switzerland, France, Belgium, United States and Austria!
Cast:
Vladimir: Constantin Tripes
Estragon: Rafael Svarin
Pozzo: Ash Maxime Goldeh
Lucky: Miro Caltagirone
Boy: Tomás Lallemand
Artistic staff and crew:
Director: Mathilde Schennen
Assistant director : Sabrina Worsch
Costume / Set design : Darla Krupnik

How the funds raised will be used : 

All funds raised will be used for the costs associated with the production of the play. Even if we do a lot by ourselves, we need your support to cover some costs that cannot be ignored. These include renting the theater ($1500+), the right of the play ($225), the insurance ($195), some specific pieces of costumes and props ($100+), a part of the promotion ($100+) and the technical supports ($50+).  Depending on our funds, we'll gain higher in quality and more freedom. Therefore we would like to thank you already for your help and support. For each contribution, you'll get a perk! We hope you'll enjoy the show!

Combined with this £3000 Indiegogo campaign, we'll hit our target and make an amazing Festival happen!We have fantastic perks on offer, from loyalty cards and limited edition T-shirts to free tickets and a VIP-booth experience. There are three fantastic double-bill shows on offer, over three nights. 
Please note perks including tickets for one of the three main shows are subject to 
availability, but we will endeavor to match all supporters to their preferred show.If we don't reach our target, a pared down version of the festival will go ahead - but we can't make it a 'festival to beat all festivals' without your support. The Impact
Contacting the World gives Manchester audiences access to
inspirational theatre from around the world. The travelling companies are rarely seen
outside of their countries. None of those involved would have the chance to meet, exchange ideas and be inspired to new heights of creative brilliance without the festival.
The international companies involved as 'twins' are:
Bread 'n' Butter Entertainment, Mumbai,
India  and Corby Young Actors, Corby, England

Margintheater, Tehran, Iran and Contact Young
Actors Company, Manchester, England
Quilt Performing Arts Company, Kingston, Jamaica
and Firefly Arts - FRESH, Livingston, Scotland. 


Contacting the World gives young people from around the
world a once in a lifetime opportunity to travel to Manchester and live and
work with Mancunians.  Through the
programme they improve their skills in theatre-making, facilitation, writing,
directing and communication; and we learn about them and their culture.Previous Festival participants have this to say about the
Festival: 
“Contacting the World
is exactly the sort of festival the world needs. A lot of the problems we
experience in this world are the result of us not knowing or being able to
relate to one another. CTW brings people together, helps participants to learn
about each other’s cultures and uses the medium of creative expression through
theatre to help spread the message of understanding and unity.” Emma,
participant, 2012
“The opportunity to
meet and work with talented artists from all over the world is incredible,
between expanding our minds and improving our skills as people and performers,
Contact provides a totally unique experience.” Ruaridh, participant, 2014
Festival participants in 2012Hosting the Festival in Manchester brings the
Northwest to the forefront of creative arts globally. Contacting the World
is an amazing opportunity for audiences and artists from around the world.
Be part of this rich cultural experience – an inspiration

Who would win?</i></b> We are all wrestling with this material, these larger than life characters and this controversial sport and we aim to bring audiences an exciting, thoughtful provocative show that looks at who these men are, why they fight and what their similarities and differences are both in and out of the ring. The video (above) is made up of rehearsal footage that was shot during our residency at Abrons Arts Center in August 2013 and features text by James Baldwin to give you a glimpse at what we're working on.  </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><b>&gt;&gt; This campaign will raise the final $15k of our budget before the final performance. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0.06em;""> </span></b></p><p>One of the questions we're frequently asked is, <b><i>how do you make something like this?</i></b>  To be sure, the process is ever-evolving and continues to build on technologies and methods that Reid Farrington has developed during his last 3 projects. </p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">To give you an idea:</span></p><blockquote>

</blockquote><blockquote><span style=""font-style: normal;""><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><b>September:</b> Started talking to 3LD and PS122 about what the project could be and how they could support it.</span></span></blockquote><blockquote><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><b style=""font-style: normal;"">December:</b><span style=""font-style: normal;""> Awarded $18K from NYSCA to begin building </span>TYSON vs. ALI</span></blockquote><blockquote><span style=""font-style: normal;""><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><b>March 2013:</b> Held auditions and cast 4 boxers to be part of the project: Roger, Jon, Dennis, and Femi.</span></span></blockquote><blockquote><span style=""font-style: normal;""><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><b>April—June:</b> Reid read a lot of books, watched a lot of footage of fights and press conferences. He met with Frank and Laura N. to discuss the narrative and visual themes, as well as operating principles of the show.</span></span></blockquote><blockquote><span style=""font-style: normal;""><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><b>June—July:</b> The guys trained at Gleason’s Gym in Brooklyn and Reid asked them to play around with clips from Tyson and Ali’s press conferences and other appearances. Our video editor made a collage of all the knock-outs that Tyson and Ali every had, so that they played at the exact minute and second of the round that they happened in. This is called our “mash-up.”</span></span></blockquote><blockquote><span style=""font-style: normal;""><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><b>August:</b> We built our set (a full sized boxing ring!) at Abrons Arts Center and had rehearsals 5 days a week. Laura N. worked on the exact combinations that Tyson or Ali and their opponents did in each knock-out with the performers. We placed the KO’s in the ring where they actually occurred and at the exact moment that they occurred. This is the foundation of our fight choreography. The guys move from one KO to the next, and fill the “gaps” with sparring or other action. We also started working with Frank’s script that he wrote based off of the existing video clips and text that we wanted to use. Juan started making a sound track to lay over the whole show, Laura M. started building out her lighting design, and Simon continued to work on editing video so that eventually we would be able to project the fight footage onto the life-sized screens that Dave, who plays the Ref, has to move to capture the images. We shared the progress we made over our 4 week residency with audiences in an open rehearsal and learned a lot about what needed to be done between then and January 3.</span></span></blockquote><blockquote><span style=""font-style: normal;""><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><b>September:</b> We had a few weeks of rehearsals at 3LD to revisit the material from August and discuss big adjustments that we wanted to make before returning to a period of intense rehearsals in December.</span></span></blockquote><blockquote><span style=""font-style: normal;""><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><b>Now:</b> We have just loaded in all our things to and are ready for our last 6 weeks of intense rehearsals to finish the show and merge all of the elements together. The guys climb into the ring on November 30 and don’t really get a break until our final performance.</span></span></blockquote><p>We are fortunate to have the steadfast support of two NYC based organizations, 3LD Art &amp; Technology Center and Performance Space 122.  <b>Participation in PS122’s COIL Festival positions TYSON vs. ALI to be seen by producers and presenters and picked up for national and international tours. </b>AND — If a 10-round match, complete with real boxing, projections of Tyson and Ali, and an elaborate script didn’t sound like enough<b> — 3LD has charged us to simultaneously develop a 3D film of the project!</b> This film will be a ""stand-alone"" artwork with it’s own unique story separate from the live performance. Think <i>Pina</i> (Wim Wenders' film about the choreographer Pina Bausch) meets <i>Hearts of Darkness</i> (the making of <i>Apocalypse Now</i>). The film will be submitted to Sundance, and other film festivals, and will serve as permanent documentation of the making of this large scale multi-media performance that's based on two cultural icons. Needless to say, the pressure's on!</p><p>There’s no doubt that we’re attempting to move some mountains with this exciting endeavor and in order to do this we need a strong network of fans. The total budget for <i>TYSON vs. ALI</i> is upwards of $350,000 and we've got just $15,000 left to raise. This portion goes towards the salaries of the performers, designers, and technical artists. Increasingly we see stories in the news and on Facebook about the cost (and impossibility) of being an artist in New York City and <b>we're hoping you share our belief that everyone should be paid for their commitment, talent, and hours of labor.</b> </p><p>And, if you think about the real value of what we're offering, and the fact that tickets are only $20, we hope you'll consider making a donation of at least $60.</p><p></p><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Here's how you can be a part of this: </h3><p></p><ol>

People are both electrified and perplexed by the idea—in fact, two articles in The New York Times featured us before tickets went on sale!Fearlessly led by director Reid Farrington, the staff of 22—including performers, designers, and technical artists—is dedicated to telling a story about the most contested “What Ifs” in boxing history. What if Mike Tyson and Muhammad Ali were to meet in their prime? Who would win? We are all wrestling with this material, these larger than life characters and this controversial sport and we aim to bring audiences an exciting, thoughtful provocative show that looks at who these men are, why they fight and what their similarities and differences are both in and out of the ring. The video (above) is made up of rehearsal footage that was shot during our residency at Abrons Arts Center in August 2013 and features text by James Baldwin to give you a glimpse at what we're working on.  >> This campaign will raise the final $15k of our budget before the final performance.  One of the questions we're frequently asked is, how do you make something like this?  To be sure, the process is ever-evolving and continues to build on technologies and methods that Reid Farrington has developed during his last 3 projects. To give you an idea:
February 2012: Reid rented 'Tyson' at the New York Public Library

May: Reid began to talk to Frank, the playwright
September: Started talking to 3LD and PS122 about what the project could be and how they could support it.December: Awarded $18K from NYSCA to begin building TYSON vs. ALIMarch 2013: Held auditions and cast 4 boxers to be part of the project: Roger, Jon, Dennis, and Femi.April—June: Reid read a lot of books, watched a lot of footage of fights and press conferences. He met with Frank and Laura N. to discuss the narrative and visual themes, as well as operating principles of the show.June—July: The guys trained at Gleason’s Gym in Brooklyn and Reid asked them to play around with clips from Tyson and Ali’s press conferences and other appearances. Our video editor made a collage of all the knock-outs that Tyson and Ali every had, so that they played at the exact minute and second of the round that they happened in. This is called our “mash-up.”August: We built our set (a full sized boxing ring!) at Abrons Arts Center and had rehearsals 5 days a week. Laura N. worked on the exact combinations that Tyson or Ali and their opponents did in each knock-out with the performers. We placed the KO’s in the ring where they actually occurred and at the exact moment that they occurred. This is the foundation of our fight choreography. The guys move from one KO to the next, and fill the “gaps” with sparring or other action. We also started working with Frank’s script that he wrote based off of the existing video clips and text that we wanted to use. Juan started making a sound track to lay over the whole show, Laura M. started building out her lighting design, and Simon continued to work on editing video so that eventually we would be able to project the fight footage onto the life-sized screens that Dave, who plays the Ref, has to move to capture the images. We shared the progress we made over our 4 week residency with audiences in an open rehearsal and learned a lot about what needed to be done between then and January 3.September: We had a few weeks of rehearsals at 3LD to revisit the material from August and discuss big adjustments that we wanted to make before returning to a period of intense rehearsals in December.Now: We have just loaded in all our things to and are ready for our last 6 weeks of intense rehearsals to finish the show and merge all of the elements together. The guys climb into the ring on November 30 and don’t really get a break until our final performance.We are fortunate to have the steadfast support of two NYC based organizations, 3LD Art & Technology Center and Performance Space 122.  Participation in PS122’s COIL Festival positions TYSON vs. ALI to be seen by producers and presenters and picked up for national and international tours. AND — If a 10-round match, complete with real boxing, projections of Tyson and Ali, and an elaborate script didn’t sound like enough — 3LD has charged us to simultaneously develop a 3D film of the project! This film will be a ""stand-alone"" artwork with it’s own unique story separate from the live performance. Think Pina (Wim Wenders' film about the choreographer Pina Bausch) meets Hearts of Darkness (the making of Apocalypse Now). The film will be submitted to Sundance, and other film festivals, and will serve as permanent documentation of the making of this large scale multi-media performance that's based on two cultural icons. Needless to say, the pressure's on!There’s no doubt that we’re attempting to move some mountains with this exciting endeavor and in order to do this we need a strong network of fans. The total budget for TYSON vs. ALI is upwards of $350,000 and we've got just $15,000 left to raise. This portion goes towards the salaries of the performers, designers, and technical artists. Increasingly we see stories in the news and on Facebook about the cost (and impossibility) of being an artist in New York City and we're hoping you share our belief that everyone should be paid for their commitment, talent, and hours of labor. And, if you think about the real value of what we're offering, and the fact that tickets are only $20, we hope you'll consider making a donation of at least $60.Here's how you can be a part of this: 

Donate — any amount helps. We'll be offering great perks over the course of the campaign, and know you'll feel good supporting the creation of new work. 


Buy a ticket — performances begin January 3, 2014 and we recommend you come back more than once!

THANK YOU!We look forward to posting updates from rehearsals, behind the scenes of the performance, and audience reactions. TYSON vs. ALI is produced by 3-Legged Dog Productions and commissioned by PS122 with support from a 50th Anniversary Grant from the Jerome Foundation, New York State Council on the Arts with the support of Governor Andrew Cuomo and the New York State Legislature.

<p>Dear Friends and Family, <br/></p>
<p>I was just accepted to an artist residency in Brussels, BE. The focus of the residency is exactly in line with the work I have been doing both as a solo artist, with Dramatis Personae, and with my teaching and community based work. This is an AMAZING opportunity for me to expand my artistic 
practice and I'm pretty sure I haven't been this excited about 
something...well....EVER! I really hope you can help, so I can make this dream a reality. You will forever have my gratitude and appreciation (although you probably already do!). Below are all the details about the residency, the training I will receive and the costs involved. <br/></p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Who is Tree.Lock//Productions?</h3>
<p>We are Meg Kirchhoff and Sterling Melcher.  Meg is a dancer in the Twin Cities, and Sterling is a theater artist in Philadelphia.  After graduating together from St. Olaf College 5 years ago, we decided to team up and begin a small production company called Tree.Lock//Productions, focusing on cross-country productions in dance and theater.  Our first production, SplitScreen, is a dual-city, simultaneous duet.  Working with Google Hangout and other publicly accessible technologies we’re using this production to investigate what it is to connect and remain human in a world that is quickly being inundated with new and far-reaching technological advances.  We want this show to help bring an empathetic approach to the way we perceive technological interactions on a daily basis, rather than having them take away our individuality or stifle connections within society.</p>
<p>Right now we are entering our final stages of production to get ready for the coming festival season.  In May we were lucky enough to spend two weeks in Fergus Falls, MN, participating in the Hinge Artist Residency through Springboard for the Arts.  Given the time and space in such a beautiful community, we laid the fundamental groundwork for SplitScreen.  Since the beginning of our process in April of 2018, we have been fully self-funding and are turning to you to help us achieve our new goals.</p>
<p>We are excited to present our work to the public, and through our work-in-progress showings we’ve seen audiences react emphatically about the work we’re creating.  Your contributions will allow us to bring a new level of professionalism to this production.</p>
</div><div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">What does Tree.Lock want?</h3>
<p>We are looking to raise $5000 for our production SplitScreen.  All funds raised will go towards production costs:  </p>
<ul>
<li>Projectors</li>
<li>Subsidized ticket costs for each festival, focusing on radical hospitality</li>
<li>Rehearsal space in Philadelphia and Minneapolis</li>
<li>Performance space for both festivals (excluding the Minneapolis portion of the MN Fringe)</li>
<li>Working wages for two artistic consultants</li>
<li>Working wages for a musical collaborator</li>
<li>Working wages for Meg and Sterling</li>
</ul>
<p>Everyone who donates will receive a personalized email from us containing photos and a small video clip from the production.  $25 or more gets a live shoutout during the festival $50 or more gets a shoutout, will be listed as a sponsor in our program. A $100 donation gets you everything listed above, as well as a personal Q+A session with the artists over Google Hangout</p>
<p>Regardless of whether or not we reach our desired goal, every amount of donation is greatly appreciated and will help us fully realize this production.</p>
</div><div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The long-term</h3>
<p>We believe in the power of local, independently produced, experimental art and its inherent benefit to society.  Not only does it spread a sense of empathy and adventurousness, but it also allows us to view the everyday aspects of our lives in a different way.  This production, as a small contribution to that larger pool of experimental art, is trying to make sure that we do not lose ourselves in a digital age we cannot avoid.  We want to make sure that everyone who comes in contact with the work changes even a small perspective they have about the world for the better.</p>
<p>Both of us have been a part of various productions in our respective cities.  Meg has been both a choreographer and dancer in the Twin Cities, and is also a dance teacher for young dancers, allowing the experiments she creates outside of class to help effect the next generation of artists, and vice versa.  Sterling has produced and performed in various fringe shows over the past three years, and is committed to independent production of his and his fellow artists work in Philadelphia.</p>
</div><div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Why <i>SplitScreen</i>?</h3>
<p>Experimental art is always a gamble, and its effects are often not seen for many years, if they are ever seen at all.  However, if this kind of work is not funded, and especially not funded by the public, then young artists won’t get the chance to discover their greatest work through failure or success, especially at pivotal points in their early career.  </p>
<p>We were lucky enough to be awarded a two week residency through Springboard for the Arts and their Hinge Arts Residency at the Kirkbride in Fergus Falls, MN.  This time allowed us an unmitigated rehearsal period where we were able to lay the groundwork for what will be premiered this summer. Also, we were awarded one of three Artist Grants from the Minnesota Fringe, covering the production costs usually associated with festival entrance. The combination of residencies and grants has shown us that other people believe in what we are doing, and want to see its fullest outcome. With the combined efforts of our own individual practice, and the time that we have already spent in research and development for this show we believe we can bring to life a production that, if anything, will be a new and entertaining experience for everyone in attendance.</p>

<h3>The Cameo Theater</h3>
<p>The Cameo Theatre opened in the 1930’s to serve the (Greater Binghamton) Robinson Street neighborhood. It has a bird cage style box office, inside the lobby. The concession stand and restrooms are located in the rear of the auditorium. The theatre was operated for many years by Ken and Fran Robinson, who were very popular in the community. The theater served over 800-1000 patrons at one time, until it's closing in 2002 and has been empty ever since. </p>

The Cameo Theatre opened in the 1930’s to serve the (Greater Binghamton) Robinson Street neighborhood. It has a bird cage style box office, inside the lobby. The concession stand and restrooms are located in the rear of the auditorium. The theatre was operated for many years by Ken and Fran Robinson, who were very popular in the community. The theater served over 800-1000 patrons at one time, until it's closing in 2002 and has been empty ever since.

<p><b>What is it?</b></p>
<p>""The
theatre, no doubt, is always in crisis.” Join in on an exorcism and funeral
march for the theatre. What happens if we take all the reasons fancy dead
Western men say theatre is bad and try to perform them to the fullest degree? Inspired
by the book <i>The Antitheatrical Prejudice</i>
which chronicles the deep-seated hatred of theatre throughout history, this
piece examines, and <i>does</i>, why people have always thought theatre to be an
abomination. Is it possible that we will find something realer than real
through adopting theatricality as a mode of existence and compulsively
rehearsing her vices: imitation, ostentation, imminence, effeminacy, and
entertainment? After all, “all doers are actors” and “lying is the foundation
of all humanity and civilization.""</p><p><br/></p><p><b>Rhinofest?</b></p><p>Scarlett Kim &amp; Co.'s <i>The Antitheatrical Prejudice </i>is a part of the 26th Annual Rhinoceros Theater Festival hosted by Curious Theatre Branch. Here's a bit about the awesome Rhinofest:</p><p></p><p><i>Each year, Curious curates and produces the Rhinoceros Theater Festival, which provides production and exhibition opportunities to hundreds of artists, drawing thousands in attendance each year. The longest-running fringe festival in Chicago, the Rhino features works in theater and performance from Chicago companies and national artists alike. First organized in the Wicker Park neighborhood of Chicago, the Rhinofest is unique among national fringe festivals in that artists are never charged a fee to participate, and each year our programs are individually curated rather than selected on a lottery basis.</i></p><p><br/></p><p></p>
<p><b>Reinforce THIS. (a.k.a. things we are interested in)</b></p>
<p>Acknowledging and interrogating the Canon/canonicity. Female
celebrities that are not dead but whose careers are dead. Shakespeare quotes
not just as “what they are” but as indexical objects. Process and product as
one. Rehearsal room rituals. Our identities as twenty-something theatre makers.
Staging not inherently performative texts. Historical analog between femininity
and imminence. Structural principle of the pastiche. Creating/doing things in
real time and space (except for when
we’re doing fake things, we like that too, we just acknowledge it as such
widly). Camp &amp; Kitsch. The fact that the author keeps mysteriously
saying the book was complete “under difficult circumstances.” Manhood and
machinehood as not a dichotomy, but having a more intricate, tenuous
relationship. Ineffability/irrelevance of Truth. Polemical theses. Using
theoretical texts as instructional scores. Humor.</p><p><br/></p>

the piece takes on the form of a pastiche: a patchwork of impressions,

this world through a <i>visceral</i> logic. The world employs elements of theatre –
text, character, plot, audience, etc. – as ‘objects’ on a horizontal plane,
creating an environment that can be experienced rather than a linear storyline
that is neatly packaged to be preached. The audience is then invited to attend
to the world exercising their own agency and construct for themselves their own
version of how the puzzle pieces fit together: metaphorically, but also
literally, as the audience will be invited to channels through which they can
physically impact the world of the piece, and make sense of the whole thing in

audience to explore a smorgasbord of experiments has a heightened potential to
elicit resonance and allow them to adventure on in their own ways afterwards.

""The
theatre, no doubt, is always in crisis.” Join in on an exorcism and funeral
march for the theatre. What happens if we take all the reasons fancy dead
Western men say theatre is bad and try to perform them to the fullest degree? Inspired
by the book The Antitheatrical Prejudice
which chronicles the deep-seated hatred of theatre throughout history, this
piece examines, and does, why people have always thought theatre to be an
abomination. Is it possible that we will find something realer than real
through adopting theatricality as a mode of existence and compulsively
rehearsing her vices: imitation, ostentation, imminence, effeminacy, and
entertainment? After all, “all doers are actors” and “lying is the foundation
of all humanity and civilization.""Rhinofest?Scarlett Kim & Co.'s The Antitheatrical Prejudice is a part of the 26th Annual Rhinoceros Theater Festival hosted by Curious Theatre Branch. Here's a bit about the awesome Rhinofest:Each year, Curious curates and produces the Rhinoceros Theater Festival, which provides production and exhibition opportunities to hundreds of artists, drawing thousands in attendance each year. The longest-running fringe festival in Chicago, the Rhino features works in theater and performance from Chicago companies and national artists alike. First organized in the Wicker Park neighborhood of Chicago, the Rhinofest is unique among national fringe festivals in that artists are never charged a fee to participate, and each year our programs are individually curated rather than selected on a lottery basis.
Reinforce THIS. (a.k.a. things we are interested in)
Acknowledging and interrogating the Canon/canonicity. Female
celebrities that are not dead but whose careers are dead. Shakespeare quotes
not just as “what they are” but as indexical objects. Process and product as
one. Rehearsal room rituals. Our identities as twenty-something theatre makers.
Staging not inherently performative texts. Historical analog between femininity
and imminence. Structural principle of the pastiche. Creating/doing things in
real time and space (except for when
we’re doing fake things, we like that too, we just acknowledge it as such
widly). Camp & Kitsch. The fact that the author keeps mysteriously
saying the book was complete “under difficult circumstances.” Manhood and
machinehood as not a dichotomy, but having a more intricate, tenuous
relationship. Ineffability/irrelevance of Truth. Polemical theses. Using
theoretical texts as instructional scores. Humor.

</p><p>College
students do lots of things with very little money. But, you’ve got
to admit, not of lot of them would have the passion to pull this off:</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>                          An
entirely student-mounted production of</b></p>
<p><b>                                       Shakespeare's As
You Like It</b></p>
<p><b>                                                 at
SUNY Purchase</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>Shakespeare
in the Quad is happening! But here’s the catch- (and the thing that
keeps our cast and crew up at night), -<b>we have no budget.</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>With
just a<i> little</i> financial support from you – your contribution
in ANY amount (even $5 can go a long way) – can help us seriously
blow everyone’s doors off. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>What:
</b>A completely independent
production of Shakespeare's “As You Like It”. As You Like It is
the story of two cousins left to their own devices after being
banished by an evil duke. It is a story of love, heartbreak,
struggle, triumph, mistaken identity, familial loyalties, political
and social structures and so much more. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>When:</b>
May 6<sup>th</sup>,7<sup>th</sup>,and 8<sup>th </sup>2016, just after
the 400th anniversary of Shakespeare’s death</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>Where:</b>
A terraced outdoor space behind the Humanities building on the campus
of SUNY Purchase, in Purchase, NY (Purchase's old amphitheater was
recently torn down, so we scouted this previously unused performance
venue and claimed it for “Shakespeare in the Quad”)</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>Why:</b>
SUNY Purchase students with a passion for Shakespeare find themselves
with few school-provided opportunities to participate in one of the
Bard’s plays. If we want to be involved in a show, it’s up to us.

</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>Who:</b>
Approximately 25 SUNY Purchase students. (Already we’ve completed a
series of well-attended auditions and callbacks and now have a
talented 17-person cast and ambitious seven-person production crew)</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>So
why should you pledge your hard-earned cash to this effort? </b>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps
you fall into one of these categories:</p>
<p>
</p><p>► <b>Family
and friends of someone in this show </b>– We’re working so hard
on this, guys, and we want to make you proud. It would mean the world
to have your support. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>► <b>Shakespeare
Lovers</b> – Here’s your chance to encourage and support the next
generation. Everyone in this production is participating voluntarily.
Come fall in love all over again with this fresh new look at
Shakespeare's classic tale.</p>
<p>
</p><p>► <b>Shakespeare
Haters</b> – Clearly you’ve never seen a funny, heart-warming and
efficacious Shakespeare production. Allow us the pleasure of
converting you. We will tell it expertly with Shakespeare's wit,
humor, and poetry and hopefully change your mind!</p>
<p>
</p><p>►<b>Venture
Capitalists</b> – You know successful entrepreneurs when you see
them, right? Just wait until you see our marketing plan! Heck, some
SUNY Purchase professors have already pledged to make our production
required viewing. This would be a wise and generous investment (Check out our list of perks!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>►<b>Activists
–</b> Clearly you can appreciate that if you aren’t part of the
solution (Shakespeare at SUNY Purchase!) then you are part of the
problem. This revolution is happening! Join us! Already, within our
cast/crew, we’ve united students majoring in Math, Literature, Arts
Management, Visual Arts, Studio Composition, Playwriting and
Screenwriting and beyond. And did we mention this show has
innumerable themes relevant to the 21<sup>st</sup> century? Including
an oppressive upper class and cultural repression, along with themes
any college student can appreciate, like familial conflict, first
loves, leaving a beloved home and returning to nature.</p>
<p>
</p><p>► <b>Irish
people and History Buffs – </b>The themes of oppression in As You
Like It echo the oppression of the Irish by the British-appointed
nobility. We’re telling your story by setting this production in
1800s British-occupied Ireland. For your enjoyment, we intend to
include some Irish dancing in this production. Our student directors
(Virginia Edinger and Katherine Gilmartin)  both have Irish heritage
too!</p>
<p>
</p><p>► <b>SUNY
Purchase Alumni</b> – As a student, you benefited from mentors and
supporters. If this effort pulls at your heart, won’t you please
“pay it forward?”</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>What
we need</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>We’re
thrifty and we’re working every angle we can. Here’s what <b>$2,000</b>
will buy us:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Costumes
	(we’re borrowing, renting, buying, sewing and paying for some dry
	cleaning)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Accessories
	(period hats, shoes, stockings, gloves plus sewing materials)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Props
	and set pieces</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Graphic
	design and printing of promotional materials (including programs,
	posters, flyers)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Sound equipment (renting extension chords, speakers, etc. for our musicians)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
</p><p>Reaching
the <b>$2,500 </b>mark will allow us to go above and beyond and make
our production as historically accurate and professional as possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>Thank
you!</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>Our
cast and crew thanks you, sincerely, for helping us achieve this
dream.</p>

students do lots of things with very little money. But, you’ve got
to admit, not of lot of them would have the passion to pull this off:

                          An
entirely student-mounted production of
                                       Shakespeare's As
You Like It
                                                 at
SUNY Purchase

Shakespeare
in the Quad is happening! But here’s the catch- (and the thing that
keeps our cast and crew up at night), -we have no budget.

With
just a little financial support from you – your contribution
in ANY amount (even $5 can go a long way) – can help us seriously
blow everyone’s doors off. 


What:
A completely independent
production of Shakespeare's “As You Like It”. As You Like It is
the story of two cousins left to their own devices after being
banished by an evil duke. It is a story of love, heartbreak,
struggle, triumph, mistaken identity, familial loyalties, political
and social structures and so much more. 


When:
May 6th,7th,and 8th 2016, just after
the 400th anniversary of Shakespeare’s death

Where:
A terraced outdoor space behind the Humanities building on the campus
of SUNY Purchase, in Purchase, NY (Purchase's old amphitheater was
recently torn down, so we scouted this previously unused performance
venue and claimed it for “Shakespeare in the Quad”)

Why:
SUNY Purchase students with a passion for Shakespeare find themselves
with few school-provided opportunities to participate in one of the
Bard’s plays. If we want to be involved in a show, it’s up to us.



Who:
Approximately 25 SUNY Purchase students. (Already we’ve completed a
series of well-attended auditions and callbacks and now have a
talented 17-person cast and ambitious seven-person production crew)

So
why should you pledge your hard-earned cash to this effort? 


Perhaps
you fall into one of these categories:

► Family
and friends of someone in this show – We’re working so hard
on this, guys, and we want to make you proud. It would mean the world
to have your support. 


► Shakespeare
Lovers – Here’s your chance to encourage and support the next
generation. Everyone in this production is participating voluntarily.
Come fall in love all over again with this fresh new look at
Shakespeare's classic tale.

► Shakespeare
Haters – Clearly you’ve never seen a funny, heart-warming and
efficacious Shakespeare production. Allow us the pleasure of
converting you. We will tell it expertly with Shakespeare's wit,
humor, and poetry and hopefully change your mind!

►Venture
Capitalists – You know successful entrepreneurs when you see
them, right? Just wait until you see our marketing plan! Heck, some
SUNY Purchase professors have already pledged to make our production
required viewing. This would be a wise and generous investment (Check out our list of perks!)

►Activists
– Clearly you can appreciate that if you aren’t part of the
solution (Shakespeare at SUNY Purchase!) then you are part of the
problem. This revolution is happening! Join us! Already, within our
cast/crew, we’ve united students majoring in Math, Literature, Arts
Management, Visual Arts, Studio Composition, Playwriting and
Screenwriting and beyond. And did we mention this show has
innumerable themes relevant to the 21st century? Including
an oppressive upper class and cultural repression, along with themes
any college student can appreciate, like familial conflict, first
loves, leaving a beloved home and returning to nature.

► Irish
people and History Buffs – The themes of oppression in As You
Like It echo the oppression of the Irish by the British-appointed
nobility. We’re telling your story by setting this production in
1800s British-occupied Ireland. For your enjoyment, we intend to
include some Irish dancing in this production. Our student directors
(Virginia Edinger and Katherine Gilmartin)  both have Irish heritage
too!

► SUNY
Purchase Alumni – As a student, you benefited from mentors and
supporters. If this effort pulls at your heart, won’t you please
“pay it forward?”

What
we need

We’re
thrifty and we’re working every angle we can. Here’s what $2,000
will buy us:



Costumes
	(we’re borrowing, renting, buying, sewing and paying for some dry
	cleaning)


Accessories
	(period hats, shoes, stockings, gloves plus sewing materials)


Props
	and set pieces


Graphic
	design and printing of promotional materials (including programs,
	posters, flyers)

Sound equipment (renting extension chords, speakers, etc. for our musicians)


Reaching
the $2,500 mark will allow us to go above and beyond and make
our production as historically accurate and professional as possible.

Thank
you!

Our
cast and crew thanks you, sincerely, for helping us achieve this
dream.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><i>Malevolent Creatures</i> is a theater project that began when our Artistic Director, Cecilia Cackley, read <i>A Dictionary of Fairies</i> by British folklorist, Katherine Briggs. So many of those stories about supernatural characters still seemed relevant to our world today. We have spent the past five years exploring three of these characters—Selkie, Black Annis and Tiddy Mun—and their stories through staged readings and workshops. This full production is a collaboration between Wit's End Puppets members and collaborators as well as visual artists from Maryland, DC, Texas and California. Other DC-area puppeteers and designers have been involved as well. </p>
<p>National and world events reveal to us daily how relevant the struggles in these stories remain. The Selkie story we present, with its male/female power dynamics, echoes many #MeToo stories. Ongoing conflicts in Syria and Yemen are related to our telling of Black Annis' story in which children are endangered by their surrounds. Tiddy Mun, a fairy of the fenlands in England, reminds us that human actions are snowballing into global climate disaster. We share these stories to better grasp and grapple with these issues. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are raising $2000 for this full production of<i> Malevolent Creatures</i>. Here is what that money will allow us to do: </p>
<p>-pay our sound and lighting designers who are creating the environment and ambience for the show</p>
<p>-pay the artist who created our beautiful crankie scroll</p>
<p>-pay our technicians who will help us prepare the theater for our performances</p>
<p>We have a number of different rewards for supporting our campaign including tickets to the show, custom stickers with artwork of our fairy characters, and your name in our show program. If you want to take home a piece of our work, you could get an original finger puppet. For an up close look at what we do, contribute at the highest level and meet the puppets after the show.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There are many challenges in live theater: finding a space in our very expensive city, building all the puppets and set pieces from scratch, rehearsing three separate shows to a point of readiness for an audience, etc.  We have nearly surmounted all these hurdles and are almost at go time! This is our third full-length show created as a company and our second Indiegogo campaign. We will deliver all rewards and a great puppet play in the coming weeks. We hope you will join us!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Helps us spread the word about the show on social media! Tell others who might be interested and follow our progress on our blog. </p>

<p><u><strong>Why FreeForm?</strong></u></p>
<p>The theatre used to be a religious experience. The Greeks celebrated the god of sex, drugs and rock n’ roll (Dionysus) with theatrical rites. It was a religious experience. We want to bring back the spectacle, ceremony and wild abandon of those early days of the theatre. We want to treat each show as if its never been done before. We want the audience to be enveloped in the communal aspect of the shared experience. We understand that the audience is a part of the show. Every actor knows the audience is the missing scene partner in rehearsal. Everything we do is for the audience. So, why isn’t theatre more accessible for the average joe? It was in Shakespeare’s day. The groundlings commanded the attention of the performers. It should be like that again. We are here to make theatre great again! </p>
<p>In 2017 Sean Newman and Patrick Rose sat in a Broadway theater to sit and watch Natasha, Pierre and the Great Comet of 1812. What unfolded was that very previously described religious experience. What Dave Malloy and Rachel Chavkin had created, with raucous abandon, wrapped our bodies and minds in rich detail the experience of being inside a Russian novel. We had drinks and rediscovered our love of storytelling and theatre. Suddenly we had to act! We along with a colleague, Jamie Fambrough, mounted our version of The Hunchback of Notre Dame. It was our thesis for what would eventually become Freeform Theatre Company.</p>
<p>We need your help to produce more theatre!</p>
<p>We need to raise $6,000.00 to help us produce our first phase.</p>
<p>The money will help pay various production costs. From performer stipends to costumes and scenery, your money will be visible in our productions.</p>
<p>You will be handsomely rewarded for your generosity! We have several tiers that allow you to give at whatever level is comfortable for you. With each level having equally exciting rewards. </p>
<p>Please help us begin our first phase!</p>

<p>You, our patrons, have the power to be a part of something new and exciting. Nothing like this exists in North Georgia! The impact of your contributions cannot be understated.

We want to break bread with you. We want to tell you a story. We need you to make that happen.</p>
<p><u><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></u></p>
<p>Not going lie, this is going to be hard to do. Like with anything new people haven’t heard about us, but they will. See, word of mouth is our advantage. It will feel like something you can’t wait to tell a friend about. This experience is something people will want to share. Our marketing strategy is part of the storytelling. The audience will begin the storytelling experience before we sell them a ticket. We will use social media to deliver content and storytelling directly to our patrons before the see the show.</p>

<p>Scandinavian American Theater Company (SATC) is
beyond excited and proud to present the U.S. premiere of <i>Then Silence</i> by award-winning Norwegian playwright, Arne Lygre. </p>
<p>SATC was founded to provide unique
perspectives through a new generation of Scandinavian playwrights and theater
artists. Based in New York City, we are committed to strengthening the
relationship between Scandinavia and the United States through collaborations
and interdisciplinary artistic exchange that examine and challenge the cultural
status quo. Within our first six years, we will have managed to present over 30
readings and 10 full productions. </p>
<h4>The Play</h4>
<p>SATC has grown swiftly and successfully in the
first six years and producing this provocative and insightful play is another
milestone that we hope you will join us in creating and celebrating. </p>
<p><i>Then
Silence</i> tells 10 stories that
observe humanity and it’s struggles with power, domination, loss, mortality
and ultimately, survival. The play was first produced in Oslo in 2009 and
continues its relevance in 2016. The times we live in are wrought with brothers
and sisters fighting and disagreeing with one another, but there is always hope
to be found...somewhere. </p>
<p><i>Then
Silence</i> turns a mirror on human
behavior that asks us all to consider and, hopefully, learn. The water <i>is</i> rising. </p>
<h4>What We Need</h4>
<p>Mr. Lygre’s conceptual and lyrical script provides
a unique canvas from which our creative team can build a world out of light,
color and sound. Donations of any kind go directly into supporting light, set,
costume and sound design, as well as rehearsal space rental and marketing
materials.</p>
<p></p><h4><b>Milestone</b></h4>
<p><i>Then
Silence</i> marks the third time SATC
has produced at Theatre Row on 42<sup>nd</sup> Street in New York City and the
first full production as a non-profit organization. This show is the most
recent step forward as SATC becomes the singular theatrical company to combine
and encourage artistic collaboration between America and Scandinavia.</p>
<p>Companies like SATC
would not be able to continue to provide quality work without the help and
blessings from you, the theater-going and art-loving public. If you are unable
to donate at this time, please do not hesitate to pass along this campaign or
our mission to those you know who may be interested in helping SATC continue to
strive for excellence and diversity-of-thought in independent theater in New
York City and abroad. </p>

<p><strong>""Water links us to our neighbor in a way more profound and complex than any other."" --John Thorson</strong></p>
<h3>Who Am I?</h3>
<p>I am an actress and a global citizen, a playwright and an advocate. I believe that art should serve as the hybridization of entertainment and education. I believe in stories and that everyone has a story to tell. I believe in the power of theater to change the world. I am at heart a wanderer but one who wanders with purpose; I wander to change the world.</p>
<h3>The Backstory: </h3>
<p>Seven years ago, in a freshman social studies class, I wrote my first paper about sanitation. Three years ago, as a senior in my high school's International Baccalaureate program, I wrote my first anthropological paper on the water and sanitation crisis currently occurring in Bangladesh.  Every year of my life since then, I have found a way to learn and explore another facet of Bangladesh's growing sanitation crisis. </p>
<p>This project is the culmination of seven years of academic investment, seven years of only being able to write about the problem instead of being able to do something about it, seven years of theory. This is the year I take action.<br/><br/></p>
<h3>What is it I'm trying to do? </h3>
<p>This year, through the unique opportunities provided to me by my home institution of Northwestern University, I am traveling to Bangladesh this summer to study the Bangladeshi sanitation crisis first hand. The goal of my project is to study how a diverse set of NGOs, governmental agencies, and grassroots programs function to combat the issues of water and sanitation, particularly in relationship to the needs of women and children. My project will ultimately culminate in a playscript, written to both draw attention to the sanitation crisis, to serve as a tool for discussion and progress, and to give a voice to those who would otherwise go unheard. </p>
<p>While in Bangladesh there's going to be so much to see and absorb, it's going to be a challenge to filter it all down into one cohesive play. But I have tackled this process of creative distillation before. The first play I ever wrote dealt with HIV, Multiple Sclerosis, and Alzheimer's. From that project I learned how to conduct research on sensitive subject matter and create a meaningful theater production that served as a platform for community discussion and change.</p>
<h3>What you can do:</h3>
<p>Your support will go to enabling the creation of this playscript, helping to cover the tools I need to properlyrecord and photograph my fieldwork so I can craft and promote this as a theatrical performance for social change.  </p>
<p>The perks for this indiegogo project are reflective of myself as a writer and a global citizen. My swag includes personal postcards from Bangladesh, surprise rewards, and the chance to be a part of an original artistic work.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Making the Difference:</h3>
<p>As a global health and theater major, I believe that art has the power to change the world for the better. With this project i am seeking to prove that belief. Please help me in this endeavor.</p>

<h3>Hello from us!</h3>
<p>Strung Up Theatre Company are an emerging theatre group made up of some of the best talent that the University of Cambridge has to offer. This August, we are taking two shows up to the Edinburgh Fringe but we need YOUR HELP to raise the money to buy the equipment that will set our show apart from the rest</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>We need to buy aerial silks and a trapeze in order for our show to become a reality. A <span>static extended trapeze costs £165 </span><span>and Aerial Silks cost £85 each</span>. This means that we only need £250 for the go-ahead.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Why are you asking for £500 then?</h3>
<p>Although we can run with £250, these prices are for the basic versions of each piece of equipment. Ideally we'd like to buy better quality equipment, to ensure the safety of our performers and it would hopefully mean that the equipment would last longer.</p>
<h3>What will happen to the equipment after Edinburgh?</h3>
<p>At the moment, Strung Up Theatre Company is just a name, but within a couple of years we want the company to grow into a professional theatre group. We have some incredible plans already for new shows that will also involve aerial acrobatics, to be performed not just in Cambridge but across the country and perhaps even internationally. In the long run, it will save us a huge amount to know that we've made the investment to buy our own, good quality equpiment that we can then train more and more people on.</p>
<h3>Why can't you just buy it yourselves?</h3>
<p>As much as we wish we were millionaires already, unfortunately that isn't the case. We're just a bunch of students, riddled with debt and without a penny to our name. We've sought backing from university societies but there's only so far that their money can take us and inevitably, they need their money back so that they can reinvest it into other shows. We need to start making our OWN money in order for Strung Up Theatre Company to become a reality. Please support our endeavours.</p>

<div><em>Dance is a powerfull comunication tool of integration of cultures, arts, languages and creative thoughts.

<div>
<p><br/>We moved to Florence Italy when I was six years old and I continued to study dance. When I was 16 I understood that this was a very difficult profession that required traveling, training, learning and investing all of my time. I begged my parents to let me go to New York to attend a Martha Graham summer intensive and the next year to attend a similar seminar at Alvin Ailey also in New York and then it was London and Amsterdam and Vienna.</p>
<p>I did my professional three year formation in Milano Italy and I had the chance to meet some important coreographers. I got to know about the P.A.R.T.S school in Brussels Belgium which has over the years become one of the best centers for contemporary dance. <strong>It is something similar to Juilliard.</strong> For contemporary dancers.</p>
<p>They take only 50 dancers and train them for a three year period with the best dance professionals from all over the world.</p>
<p>THIS MEANS that this exclusive program starts only ONCE every THREE YEARS!!</p>
<p>To apply you need to participate to an audition <span class=""notranslate"">Studios (P.A.R.T.S.)<span class=""notranslate""> under the direction of Anne Teresa De Keersmaeke</span>r in Brussels, Belgium.  About 1,000 dance artists auditioned across the world from 70 countries in about 30 audition sessions across the world. </span></p>
<p><span class=""notranslate"">During my audition session there where about 70 people and less than 10 were asked to stay. Than you were invited in May 2013 for one full week of very demanding auditions at the school. There were at this point only 176 left from the 1032 applicants. At mid week half were sent home. And then only 50 were confermed. <br/></span></p>
<p><span class=""notranslate"">I am a very lucky dancer and I got into this incredible school that gives an unique opportunity to have access to an amazing array of professionals that give you all their knowledge and help you become the best dancer and dance professional you can be. <br/></span></p>
<p><span class=""notranslate"">The classes include yoga and tai chi and microbiotic cooking and injury prevention and all the possible techniques both teorethical and pratical.<br/></span></p>
<p><span class=""notranslate"">Actually in January of 2013 I moved to Brussels because this is how much I wanted to attend P.A.R.T.S, found a little waitressing job and a room in a house right across the school. I did not know at that time I would make it in the final cut. </span></p>
<p><span class=""notranslate"">IT MAKES ALL THE DIFFERENCE IN THE WORLD FOR ANY CONTEMPORARY DANCER TO BE SO LUCKY TO ATTEND P.A.R.T.S<br/></span></p>
<p><span class=""notranslate"">Please help me in any way you can reach my goal<br/></span></p>
<p><span class=""notranslate"">I have a summer job and my parents are doing all they can.   I can make it to provide for my living expenses and hopefully my rent. However there is a steep 4500 euro one time inscription and 2500 yearly tuition fee. This is a lot of money we do not have and this is why I ask you to help me.<br/></span></p>
<p><span class=""notranslate"">Therefore my goal is to put together 4500 euros for the inscription. This is what I need for the first year. I will be applying for grants and bursaries for the next two years and hope I won't need any other help.<br/></span></p>
<p><span class=""notranslate"">Any help will be welcome even only spreading the word and using the Indiegogo share tools<br/></span></p>

When I was 16 I understood that this was a very difficult profession that required traveling, training, learning and investing all of my time. I begged my parents to let me go to New York to attend a Martha Graham summer intensive and the next year to attend a similar seminar at Alvin Ailey also in New York and then it was London and Amsterdam and Vienna.
I did my professional three year formation in Milano Italy and I had the chance to meet some important coreographers. I got to know about the P.A.R.T.S school in Brussels Belgium which has over the years become one of the best centers for contemporary dance. It is something similar to Juilliard. For contemporary dancers.
They take only 50 dancers and train them for a three year period with the best dance professionals from all over the world.
THIS MEANS that this exclusive program starts only ONCE every THREE YEARS!!
To apply you need to participate to an audition Studios (P.A.R.T.S.) under the direction of Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker in Brussels, Belgium.  About 1,000 dance artists auditioned across the world from 70 countries in about 30 audition sessions across the world. 
During my audition session there where about 70 people and less than 10 were asked to stay. Than you were invited in May 2013 for one full week of very demanding auditions at the school. There were at this point only 176 left from the 1032 applicants. At mid week half were sent home. And then only 50 were confermed. 
I am a very lucky dancer and I got into this incredible school that gives an unique opportunity to have access to an amazing array of professionals that give you all their knowledge and help you become the best dancer and dance professional you can be. 
The classes include yoga and tai chi and microbiotic cooking and injury prevention and all the possible techniques both teorethical and pratical.
Actually in January of 2013 I moved to Brussels because this is how much I wanted to attend P.A.R.T.S, found a little waitressing job and a room in a house right across the school. I did not know at that time I would make it in the final cut. 
IT MAKES ALL THE DIFFERENCE IN THE WORLD FOR ANY CONTEMPORARY DANCER TO BE SO LUCKY TO ATTEND P.A.R.T.S
Please help me in any way you can reach my goal
I have a summer job and my parents are doing all they can.   I can make it to provide for my living expenses and hopefully my rent. However there is a steep 4500 euro one time inscription and 2500 yearly tuition fee. This is a lot of money we do not have and this is why I ask you to help me.
Therefore my goal is to put together 4500 euros for the inscription. This is what I need for the first year. I will be applying for grants and bursaries for the next two years and hope I won't need any other help.
Any help will be welcome even only spreading the word and using the Indiegogo share tools
 
Thank you so very much

<p>We are raising money for our production of WAKE UP! a new play by Actor/Playwright Kim Fischer at the 2012 New York Fringe Festival. This show is fresh off of a great run in the 2011 New Orleans Fringe Festival where it received positive reviews and a great crowd of theatre goers!  </p>
<p>The play is about racial tensions between whites and blacks as they become violent in the present. Desean Johnson sits in prison at war with his own yellow skin. Does an Asian boy have the right to own and defend his American blackness?</p>

<p><strong>WHO WE ARE</strong></p>
<p>Hi! My name is Kyle Williams. I’m a part of an up and coming arts organization called Red Bone Theatrical based in Brooklyn, NY. We are a collective of artists and dreamers from all over the U.S. Our mission is to bring more dramatic art to the stage in North America. Maybe even the world! Yeah, I know that might be a little ambitious, but with your help our current project will be a smash.</p>
<p>Fischer asks the questions: What does it mean to be black enough? Is black simply a racial category or a cultural phenomenon of American society? Is it both? Does culture belong to anyone specific or is it open to outsiders? Does race automatically assign you a culture or can we be free to choose who we are? What is blackness?  </p>

<h3>About Beautiful Soup Theater</h3>
<p>Beautiful Soup Theater was founded in 2010 by Artistic Director Steven Carl McCasland with the goal of producing theater that could benefit the community. Once we select our shows, we reach out to the author(s) to choose charity that is important to them. A portion of our profits, and all donations collected by our actors post-show, are donated directly to that organization. Over time, the mission has expanded and we have begun to focus on our work as revivalists: producing works that are misunderstood or ""lost"". Previous productions include: <em>Moose Murders, </em><em>A Doll's Life, Yentl, Goodtime Charley</em> and more...</p>

<h3>What We're Doing</h3>
<p>We are producing a revival of the short-lived Stephen Schwartz, Charles Strouse and Joseph Stein musical RAGS. Featuring Strouse's boldest score, RAGS is the epic story of Rebecca Hershkowitz and her journey to America. With the immigration debate in this melting pot on the rise, there is no time better than now to re-visit this wonderful and misunderstood musical.</p>
<p>A portion of profits and all post-show donations collected by our actors, will benefit The Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, an organization of great importance to Mr. Schwartz. </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Not only will this production raise funds and awareness for an important organization, but it helps us continue to bring back these wonderful lost works for today's audiences,</p>

Gamers, players, circus artists, drag queens, impro theatre actors, Shakespearean performers – drunk or sober, all are welcome to jump on our stage.</p><p>The art project was conceived with artistic interaction and self expression in mind and aims to incite everyone to play theatre, fool around, go on stage or ask others to do crazy, daring acts. There will be opportunity to interact spontaneously, through the <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/Artphone"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">art phones</a>, and also themed evenings (<a href=""http://letittytwister.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Titty Twister Bar</a> - <a href=""http://youtu.be/MV-Zzasrky8"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Priscilla Queen of the Desert</a> - <a href=""http://youtu.be/7SYg_7pNptQ"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus!</a>), games and programmed pieces of improvisation theatre where everyone will be invited to join.</p><p><br/> </p><h3><b>The Vision</b></h3><p>You stroll around the <a href=""http://www.goingnowhere.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Nowhere</a> area and see a shaded space: Colorful lights,<br/>little tables, chairs… and you are invited: Come into The Drunken Sobriety<br/>Cabaret! You have a seat, you have a rest… but what is that? There are funny,<br/>artsy phones on the table, and one of them rings! You pick it up, surprised –<br/>and are invited to join the stage… but where is the stage? It is moving around<br/>Nowhere – if you find it, you can play! … You are strolling around the Nowhere<br/>area, and see a stage – lights flashing up and down the side of the stairs...<br/>what, this wasn’t there yesterday! Curious, you approach… on the stage you are prompted to play! Improvise! Be a Shakespearean actor, be a drag queen, be a harlequin, be… wait: A phone is ringing! You pick it up, and someone tells you to do something fancy, crazy, or an act of daring…</p><p>The Drunken Sobriety Cabaret idea was born out of a brainstorming<br/>session of Sebastian and Tünde, who met at Costume Camp at Nowhere last year. It brought together their ideas of a mobile carriage which would incite and<br/>invite Nobodies to play and of a stage where an improvised theatre pieces could be enacted by as many spontaneous actors as possible.</p><p>Thus the idea: A project called “Drunken Sobriety”, with two main<br/>elements, The Cabaret and the Stage Car. The cabaret space will have a shade<br/>structure and little tables and chairs, with a colorful setting, and a mobile<br/>Stage Car. The Stage Car and some of the tables will move around during the<br/>festival, so sometimes the cabaret space would have a stage, sometimes there<br/>would be a cabaret popping up somewhere unexpected – close to a camp, or in the middle of Nowhere… To make the project even more interactive and connected, there will be Artphones connecting tables, stage and some other points at Nowhere, making it possible that anyone (or secret inciting agents from our team) might call up the tables or the stage, giving or asking for instructions or artistic input or some crazy acts of daring. We will have some announced plays and themed evenings.</p><p><br/> </p><h3><b>The team</b></h3><p>Our team is a transnational mixture of Burners from Toulouse, Munich, Vienna and Brno.<br/><br/>Project leads are:<br/>* Sebastian aka “Lightning” (previous art projects<br/>at Nowhere: 2008 <a href=""http://orni.taf-cie.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ORNI</a>, 2009 rolling gardenswing, 2010-11 <a href=""http://www.goingnowhere.org/artarchive/project.htm?year=2011&amp;id=phones"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ARTPHONE</a>, 2012 installation of a nest, 2013 SweetART - the candyflosswigmakingcart), *Tünde aka “Thunder” (2013 <a href=""http://www.goingnowhere.org/artarchive/project.htm?year=2013&amp;id=altarofspontaneousbaptismandgifting"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Altar of Spontaneous Baptism and Gifting</a>, organizer of the Vienna Burning Ball 2014).<br/><br/>Some other team members are also seasoned Burners with experience in events organisation and art projects. <br/><br/>

The stage is yours to take…if you can find it. Themobile Stage Car might be in The Cabaret – or moving anywhere! Call with thetable phones, get directions, join the ride!A spacious shade and meeting point during the day, a sparkling buzzing nightclub at night – the Drunken Sobriety Cabaret, an art project at the Nowhere Festival 2014, invites everyone to come and express yourselves. Gamers, players, circus artists, drag queens, impro theatre actors, Shakespearean performers – drunk or sober, all are welcome to jump on our stage.The art project was conceived with artistic interaction and self expression in mind and aims to incite everyone to play theatre, fool around, go on stage or ask others to do crazy, daring acts. There will be opportunity to interact spontaneously, through the art phones, and also themed evenings (Titty Twister Bar - Priscilla Queen of the Desert - The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus!), games and programmed pieces of improvisation theatre where everyone will be invited to join. The VisionYou stroll around the Nowhere area and see a shaded space: Colorful lights,little tables, chairs… and you are invited: Come into The Drunken SobrietyCabaret! You have a seat, you have a rest… but what is that? There are funny,artsy phones on the table, and one of them rings! You pick it up, surprised –and are invited to join the stage… but where is the stage? It is moving aroundNowhere – if you find it, you can play! … You are strolling around the Nowherearea, and see a stage – lights flashing up and down the side of the stairs...what, this wasn’t there yesterday! Curious, you approach… on the stage you are prompted to play! Improvise! Be a Shakespearean actor, be a drag queen, be a harlequin, be… wait: A phone is ringing! You pick it up, and someone tells you to do something fancy, crazy, or an act of daring…The Drunken Sobriety Cabaret idea was born out of a brainstormingsession of Sebastian and Tünde, who met at Costume Camp at Nowhere last year. It brought together their ideas of a mobile carriage which would incite andinvite Nobodies to play and of a stage where an improvised theatre pieces could be enacted by as many spontaneous actors as possible.Thus the idea: A project called “Drunken Sobriety”, with two mainelements, The Cabaret and the Stage Car. The cabaret space will have a shadestructure and little tables and chairs, with a colorful setting, and a mobileStage Car. The Stage Car and some of the tables will move around during thefestival, so sometimes the cabaret space would have a stage, sometimes therewould be a cabaret popping up somewhere unexpected – close to a camp, or in the middle of Nowhere… To make the project even more interactive and connected, there will be Artphones connecting tables, stage and some other points at Nowhere, making it possible that anyone (or secret inciting agents from our team) might call up the tables or the stage, giving or asking for instructions or artistic input or some crazy acts of daring. We will have some announced plays and themed evenings. The teamOur team is a transnational mixture of Burners from Toulouse, Munich, Vienna and Brno.Project leads are:* Sebastian aka “Lightning” (previous art projectsat Nowhere: 2008 ORNI, 2009 rolling gardenswing, 2010-11 ARTPHONE, 2012 installation of a nest, 2013 SweetART - the candyflosswigmakingcart), *Tünde aka “Thunder” (2013 The Altar of Spontaneous Baptism and Gifting, organizer of the Vienna Burning Ball 2014).Some other team members are also seasoned Burners with experience in events organisation and art projects.

<h3>The Story</h3>
<p>Down the Rabbit Hole: A Year in the Life of a Sexy Mama, explores theatrically the transformative first year of motherhood for a woman immersed in alternative sexual subculture. To illustrate this transformation I will interweave elements and characters of Lewis Caroll's childhood story Alice in Wonderland, along with video pieces that will be projected onto a screen on stage. The video pieces consist of several parodies of queer-sploitation films that illustrate societal fear of non-traditional parenting and non-traditional family dynamics that include LGBT and sex workers. Video elements will also include fragments of interviews from other queer and sex worker moms and parents about their first year of motherhood and their transformative experience. I plan on incorporating interactive elements into the theater piece that creates a sense of playfulness amongst in the audience. Elements of play that may be incorporated include a game of Twister that incorporates concepts around the body image and body perception of <a href=""#"" id=""_GPLITA_1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""text-decoration: underline;"" title=""Powered by Text-Enhance"">nursing</a> mothers, Pin the Combat Boots on the Queer Mommy, and the Caterpillar Confessional in which audience members answer the question ""Who are you?"" through a tin-can telephones.  <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>In this theater piece, I play a character that resembles Alice from Alice in Wonderland, modified with autobiographical elements from my life as seen through the lens of Alice.  My character is adventurous and curious, but somewhat lost in her new surroundings of ""Mama-land"".  <br/><br/>Alice follows a Playboy bunny down the rabbit hole and into Mama-land.  During her journey she encounters characters and situations that challenge her concept of her own identity and the woman that she is transforming into.  At times she appears to be too small, at times too big.  Alice illustrates this feeling of awkward body image as she is changing into her clothes for a photo shoot and struggles to find anything that fits.  Alice faces her new identity head on as she finds herself at a Mad Hatter tea party with the Mad Hatter and the March Hare.  After consuming a cup of tea, Alice shrinks in size again and comes in contact with the Caterpillar as played by Sadie Lune, as a Zen-like dominant <a href=""#"" id=""_GPLITA_3"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""text-decoration: underline;"" title=""Powered by Text-Enhance"">Mistress</a>.

<p><em>Dance is the ultimate excercise in humility.- wca</em></p>
<p>This is something I believe from my heart of hearts, as dance allows us share what makes us human. The strenghts and frailty of the human condition are present, as are the limits of the human body.Dance is fragile and empheral- blink, as you may miss it.</p>
<p>I have danced my whole life, and it has been a limitless abundance- the teachers and gurus who have shared with me, the cultures I celebrate, the tradions I honor and the new expressions I explore are what I strive to share, without reservation. Whether it be Oriental bellydance, Indian Bollywood,Classical dances of the temple, my original dance journey of Hawaiian Hula, modern, fusion or theatrical dances, teaching, singing or composing dances, songs or poetry- I seek the common thread of celebration of the alchemy of life, the magic, of creation, the humility of being Human!</p>
<p>I grew up on an island. Hawaii is defined as one of the most geographically isolated places on Earth. And yet, by fate and hard work, I have been lucky enough to travel: see other places, countries, cultures, climates, experience life in people's homes, milongas, beaches, sunsets, their rainy season, souks and shopping centers, try new foods, dress in different ways, walked through their graveyards and climbed their mountains.</p>
<p>Even though I have been abroad, it NEVER gets old, I am Never jaded. Each opportunity is new, fresh,unique and real: I live to share Aloha, kindness, compassion, dialogue and encourage other artists to celebrate their uniqie voice, which we all have. I come in peace and I return in peace.</p>

<p>Imagine my surprise to be contacted to teach and perform in Athens for their 1st Bollywood Dance Festival! I ahve taught and performed twice before in Athens, in 2006 at the UNESCO International dance Council, where I presented my theatrical Medusa dance, entitled Ourobouros and taught Oriental bellydance.</p>
<p>In 2009, I was invited to teach again, this time with sponsor Aisha Kanakari, sharing the arts of Bellydance, Hawaiian Hula and Bollywood.</p>
<p>The 1st Bollywood Festival of Athens brings artsist from India, Spain, Greece and Hawaii ;) to celebrate the global and India dancs of Bollywood Dance! I'll be teaching hawaiian Hula as a narrative dance form,as well as performing twice! The 3 day festival features workshops and a gala show. held at the hstoric Dora Stratou Theater. This, is such an HONOR!</p>
<p><strong>What I Need</strong></p>
<p>My sponsors are generously providing travel and accomdations from Europe- so therefore, I need to get to the continent of Europe, from Hawaii. I am flying to Zurich, a maor internation flight hub, as I can stay with friends without charge. A round trip from Honolulu is costly- both time wise (rooghly a 24 hour hour trip in total, and a 12 hour time difference) and starts at $1800. Factor in luggage costs/fees, meals abroad, taxes and transporation, $2700 with go very quickly. (If my goal is not met, all funds, regardless of amount, will go to defray the costs which I will encur to get to the event.)</p>
<p>I am also doing local fundraing as well, Henna/mendhi, performances, and vending to attempt to off set costs.</p>
<p>As an independent artist/contractor, I have no paid vacation, or perks to aid in my journey.</p>
<p><em>(Admittedly, simply asking for funding is new for me, and I am <strong>deeply</strong> moved and grateful for people's previous generosity.)</em></p>
<p><strong>The opportunity to share Aloha, to encourage others to live their art, speak their voice, follow their dream- it what motivates me. It is a circle of Aloha that has no ending or beginning- and it's a gift that continues when I return to Hawaii, and lives in the hearts of everyone who we've encountered.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I will be sending my daily (and it is incessant and steady!) updates from the travels abroad! Poems, photos, videos, insights, meditations, thoughts, links and reports will be posted on my facebook page, Willow Chang Alléon and Willow Chang Dance- so please so follow me, and have a virtual journey :) !</strong></p>

In 2009, I was invited to teach again, this time with sponsor Aisha Kanakari, sharing the arts of Bellydance, Hawaiian Hula and Bollywood.
The 1st Bollywood Festival of Athens brings artsist from India, Spain, Greece and Hawaii ;) to celebrate the global and India dancs of Bollywood Dance! I'll be teaching hawaiian Hula as a narrative dance form,as well as performing twice! The 3 day festival features workshops and a gala show. held at the hstoric Dora Stratou Theater. This, is such an HONOR!
What I Need
My sponsors are generously providing travel and accomdations from Europe- so therefore, I need to get to the continent of Europe, from Hawaii. I am flying to Zurich, a maor internation flight hub, as I can stay with friends without charge. A round trip from Honolulu is costly- both time wise (rooghly a 24 hour hour trip in total, and a 12 hour time difference) and starts at $1800. Factor in luggage costs/fees, meals abroad, taxes and transporation, $2700 with go very quickly. (If my goal is not met, all funds, regardless of amount, will go to defray the costs which I will encur to get to the event.)
I am also doing local fundraing as well, Henna/mendhi, performances, and vending to attempt to off set costs.
As an independent artist/contractor, I have no paid vacation, or perks to aid in my journey.
(Admittedly, simply asking for funding is new for me, and I am deeply moved and grateful for people's previous generosity.)
The opportunity to share Aloha, to encourage others to live their art, speak their voice, follow their dream- it what motivates me. It is a circle of Aloha that has no ending or beginning- and it's a gift that continues when I return to Hawaii, and lives in the hearts of everyone who we've encountered.
I will be sending my daily (and it is incessant and steady!) updates from the travels abroad! Poems, photos, videos, insights, meditations, thoughts, links and reports will be posted on my facebook page, Willow Chang Alléon and Willow Chang Dance- so please so follow me, and have a virtual journey :) !

Custom Made is producing the WORLD PREMIERE of Josh Costello's adaptation of Cory Doctorow's Little Brother!  Little Brother is an important, entertaining near-future story about what rights we have already given up, and what might happen to the rest of our privacy and free-speech after the next terrorist attack.  It is also a love story, a tale of teenage rebellion, and a love-letter to the Bay Area.This high-tech tale is about NOW!  We need your help to make this multi-media play as brilliant as it needs to be.  We need to raise money to help pay for a projector, a video artist, and maybe even a hacker or two.  Custom Made's ticket sales only cover 50% of our production costs, even on our low-tech shows.  For a show like Little Brother to be a success we need an additional $6500 to supplement our normal production budget. About Little Brother:In the aftermath of a terrorist attack on San Francisco, 17-year-old tech hacker Marcus is suddenly apprehended by the Department of Homeland Security for days of merciless interrogation. When no one besides his friends believes his story, he’s left with only one option: take down the system himself. Could this near-future story by the award-winning novelist and BoingBoing editor really happen here... or has it already begun?
What We Need & What You Get
We expect the extra multi-media equipment, and set up, we need will cost $5500.  We will either buy the best one we can from money raised, or rent an insanely awesome set of multi-media projectors and equipment    Extra staffing on this show is going to cost another $1000. All this is above and beyond the normal operational budget Custom Made has for our shows.

We have put together some exciting perks, including invitations to the first read, opening night, and Little Brother bookplates signed by Cory Doctorow himself!

<p><strong>Our Goal: Keep ‘Em Laughing</strong></p>
<p>As Milton Berle said, laughter is an instant vacation. We are thrilled to bring Ron Clark and Sam Bobrick's screwball comedy, “Murder at the Howard Johnson’s,” to the Studio Theatre at Theatre Row, on 42nd Street in New York City.</p>
<p>Our goal with this production is two-fold: First, we want to provide a showcase for some wonderfully talented, creative people. Jeremy Bright, our producer, heads up a terrific team that includes: Heather Olmstead (Stage Manager), Abbey Dehnert (Props &amp; Asst. Set Design), Ed Davis (Sound Design), Geoffrey Bryant (Lighting Design), Nathan Dehnert (Stage Crew) and Terry Borzumato (Media Design). Our cast is made up of three accomplished New York actors: Rutanya Alda (<span style=""color: #0000ff;""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0017377/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0017377/</a></span></span>), Allan Greenberg (<span style=""color: #0000ff;""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2412625/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2412625/</a></span></span>) and Frank Gauthier (<span style=""color: #0000ff;""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4jqqCzjdTo"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4jqqCzjdTo</a></span></span>). Our Director, Eddie Lew, has directed over 35 plays in New York venues among his credits, studied for five years with the HB studio, is a member of the <span><span>HB Playwright’s Foundation Advanced/Actor Lab, where</span> he had the privilege of studying and working on productions with Uta Hagen, Salem Ludwig, Charles Nelson Reilly, George Bartenieff and Karen Malpied; he has also served as the Director of the <span>resident company at the Schimmel Center for the Performing Arts at Pace University.</span></span></p>
<p>Second, and as corny as this may sound, we think people need more opportunities to laugh<span>—</span>inexpensively. Although New York has some of the most amazing theatre in the world, inexpensive is a word rarely associated with it. Affordable $18 tickets give theatergoers an opportunity to escape to an evening of outrageous fun without the outrageous cost.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How Do You Fit into the Crime?</strong></p>
<p>To help make this experience a reality, we thought it might be fun and rewarding for all of our colleagues, friends, family and those new to our work to aid in a very critical part of the process<span>—</span>the financing. By contributing whatever you can through Indiegogo to our “Murder at the Howard Johnson’s” production, you’ll be helping us achieve our two-fold goal of showcasing the talents of some amazing people and showering the masses with an evening of much-needed laughter.</p>
<p>We have numerous hard costs to satisfy<span>—</span>the theater rental, the play rights, insurance, set construction, publicity, wardrobe, and the material needs of our team, who are donating their time. Between ticket sales and your generosity, we hope to meet these costs and compensate our hard-working production team.  </p>

<p><strong>About the Play</strong></p>
<p>Is all fair in love? Even murder? That’s the question posed by this quirky, hilarious suspenseful comedy about a love triangle in a Howard Johnson Motor Inn. In 1979, Mitchell Lovell, a commonplace dentist who imagines himself as a dashing hero, conspires with Arlene Miller, a “Femme Fatale” (of sorts), to murder her husband Paul, a blundering, monochromatic, money-obsessed used car salesman. However, as confident as this trio believes themselves to be, their criminal plans quickly go more awry than President Carter’s intervention in Iran.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Background: The Road to Murder</strong></p>
<p>A year and half ago, Rutanya Alda and Allan Greenberg performed a comedic scene in a master acting class taught by acclaimed director, producer and teacher, Ed Sherin, who came to national prominence when he directed James Earl Jones and Jane Alexander in “The Great White Hope” on Broadway in 1967. The scene Rutanya and Allan performed was from “LUV” by Murray Schisgal. Ed thought so much of the work he recommended they produce it themselves.</p>
<p>In February of 2012, we secured the rights to “LUV” from the Dramatists Play Service. Needless to say, we were very happy. We booked the Studio Theatre at Theatre Row on 42nd Street in New York, for a September 13 to October 7 run. We formed a production team and began our search for a director and a third actor. In late May, we found our director and then on June 6th, the proverbial hit the fan when Mr. Schisgal pulled the rights without warning, having never met with us.<span style=""color: #000000;""> Although this hurt, it didn’t deter us. We fielded play suggestions from colleagues all over the world and camped out at The Drama Book Shop reading, and reading, and reading. The suggestion of “Murder at the Howard Johnson’s” came from our friend and fellow actor, Josef Pfitzer, of Munich, Germany , and we fell in love with it.</span></p>
