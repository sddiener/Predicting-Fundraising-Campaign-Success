<h3>Amaya Accessories is one year old!</h3>
<p>One year ago this month, I launched <a href=""http://www.amayaaccessories.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Amaya Accessories</a> from my home in Washington, DC. </p>
<p>It was a dream come true: My own space, where I could design and make unique, handmade accessories--necklaces inspired by Matisse's cut-outs; handbags repurposed from upholstery remnants; earrings made from crochet.</p>
<p>Over the year, I connected with independent women artisans to collaborate on new designs and items. I offered jewelry-making workshops to children and clients. And I learned the ins and outs of social media to keep the business going during these complicated times.</p>
<p>Now, after securing a business license and building a loyal client base, it's time to grow!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The 2020 Campaign: From Start-Up to Sustainable!</h3>
<p>I'm looking for backers who will help my woman-owned, independent business thrive in 2021.</p>
<p>You can donate straight out, but I'd actually prefer if you leave the ""Contribution"" box blank and click on  one of the ""perks boxes"" instead. That way, your contribution not only provides some funds, but also gets more of my products out in the world--which is the best advertising there is. So please look at the perks--if there's nothing right for you, start your holiday shopping early!</p>
<p>My goal is to infuse the business with $1200 to start 2021 strong.  $800 will go toward the creation of new collections, including a line of earrings inspired by the artwork of Colombian artist Omar Rayo and some awesome new laptop bags handmade from upcycled upholstery remnants. The remaining funds will help me launch a social media ad campaign to expand my reach.</p>

<p>The Style Guide is a <strong>free </strong>new website that organizes thousands of men's style photographs (from your favorite magazines, blogs, &amp; fashion brands) into an interactive and easy-to-use platform that provides instant outfit suggestions for <strong>any occasion, season</strong>, or <strong>clothing item</strong>. </p>
<p>All the photos in The Style Guide are hand-picked and meticulously categorized by award-winning menswear expert <strong>Dan Trepanier</strong> and the team behind his leading men's style website <a href=""http://www.tsbmen.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">TSBmen.com</a>.</p>

<p>The Style Guide solves three problems:</p>
<p>1.<strong> ONE-STOP STYLING</strong>. Every day millions of guys search the internet for style advice/inspiration, but there isn't one place that brings all of this content together in a way that is easy to navigate. <em>The Style Guide</em> aggregates menswear photos from top-quality sources (men's magazines, street style blogs, fashion brands, etc.) into one expertly-organized platform to help guys find great style.</p>
<p>2. <strong>CONTENT MANAGEMENT</strong>. The only content currently consumed online is that which is <em>most recently published</em>. After a week or two, photo shoots, magazine articles, and blog posts get lost in the depths of website archives. The Style Guide organizes all of this content for you, and links directly back to the original source of every photo, so it's a great way to find great new sites too. </p>
<p>3. <strong>INSPIRATION + E-COMMERCE</strong>. Ever look at a style photo online and wonder<em>where </em>you can buy the items right now? You shouldn't have to get your advice/inspiration from one place, then have to search for the products in another. Every item in every photo featured on The Style Guide is instantly shoppable. We've spent over a year developing our shopping algorithm to offer only the<em> best </em>menswear products, offered in <em>three different price points</em> so every guy can afford to upgrade his style. </p>
<h2>""In my opinion, <em>content management</em> is the future of fashion blogging and online publishing. There is just too much great content that is not seen, or that gets lost in the shuffle of the internet.""</h2>

<p>Our photo library (which is growing daily) is meticulously categorized using the following filter criteria:</p>
<p><strong>1. Occasion</strong><br/>Choose from more than 50 possible occasions for appropriate, and stylish, outfit suggestions. Where are you going?<br/><em>Ex: </em><em>beach wedding, job interview, first date<strong>.</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>2. Season/Weather</strong><br/>Choose the season and/or weather in your area to see only seasonal-appropriate outfits. <br/><em>Ex: summer, rain, snow, winter. </em></p>
<p><strong>3. Clothing Item </strong><br/>Enter any clothing item in your wardrobe to get instant outfit suggestions that include a similar piece. Chose to narrow the outfit suggestions by item style, color, fabric, and/or pattern.<br/><em>Ex: Suit (grey, tweed), Button-down shirt (purple, cotton, plaid), Jeans (black)</em></p>
<p><strong>*ANY </strong><strong>COMBINATION WORKS</strong><br/>You can use the outfit filters in any order and any combination. The more filters you select (occasions, seasons, clothing items), the more specific the outfit suggetions get. There are countless combinations in our thousands of photos, and we're adding more and more top-quality conten every day, from the best menswear sources online.  </p>

After playing 4 years of Division 1 hoops and graduating with an Ivy League degree in Psychology, I spent a summer interning on Wall Street and a few months in the buying office at Saks Fifth Avenue before taking my title as Esquire magazine’s <em>“Best Dressed Real Man in America”</em> and running with it.""</p>

<p>""I grew up on a ranch just outside of Houston Texas, spending my weekdays shoveling manure for my mom and weekends hunting with my dad. Needless to say, my first experience with “fashion” was heavily influenced by utility and workwear.</p>
<p>After high school I left home to study photography at Belmont University in Nashville, TN. Moving to “Music City” had a huge influence on me; my artwork changed, my clothes changed, my drinking habits changed (and by changed I mean they didn’t exist before Nashville). I fell in love with Americana and classic Southern style.</p>
<p>After graduation I moved to New York City to work on a Masters in photography from Pratt University in Brooklyn. Shortly thereafter I was introduced to Dan, we hit it off, and TSB hasn't stopped growing since!"" </p>

3. INSPIRATION + E-COMMERCE. Ever look at a style photo online and wonderwhere you can buy the items right now? You shouldn't have to get your advice/inspiration from one place, then have to search for the products in another. Every item in every photo featured on The Style Guide is instantly shoppable. We've spent over a year developing our shopping algorithm to offer only the best menswear products, offered in three different price points so every guy can afford to upgrade his style. 
""In my opinion, content management is the future of fashion blogging and online publishing. There is just too much great content that is not seen, or that gets lost in the shuffle of the internet.""


Our photo library (which is growing daily) is meticulously categorized using the following filter criteria:
1. OccasionChoose from more than 50 possible occasions for appropriate, and stylish, outfit suggestions. Where are you going?Ex: beach wedding, job interview, first date.
2. Season/WeatherChoose the season and/or weather in your area to see only seasonal-appropriate outfits. Ex: summer, rain, snow, winter. 
3. Clothing Item Enter any clothing item in your wardrobe to get instant outfit suggestions that include a similar piece. Chose to narrow the outfit suggestions by item style, color, fabric, and/or pattern.Ex: Suit (grey, tweed), Button-down shirt (purple, cotton, plaid), Jeans (black)
*ANY COMBINATION WORKSYou can use the outfit filters in any order and any combination. The more filters you select (occasions, seasons, clothing items), the more specific the outfit suggetions get. There are countless combinations in our thousands of photos, and we're adding more and more top-quality conten every day, from the best menswear sources online.  
 
It's not just for TSBmen photos, it's for all the quality menswear sites online.

Dan TrepanierFashion Stylist & Founder of TSBmen.comEsquire Magazine's ""Best Dressed Real Man in America""

""Born and raised on a small farm outside of Windsor Ontario Canada, it has been quite a journey to becoming a fashion stylist in downtown Manhattan.
I came to NYC to attend Columbia University, where I was recruited to play basketball. After playing 4 years of Division 1 hoops and graduating with an Ivy League degree in Psychology, I spent a summer interning on Wall Street and a few months in the buying office at Saks Fifth Avenue before taking my title as Esquire magazine’s “Best Dressed Real Man in America” and running with it.""
In 2009 Dan started a men's style blog from his college dorm room, which has grown into one of the most popular online menswear publications worldwide: TSBmen.com. Today he styles, writes and manages TSB full-time with a talented and loyal team. On the side, he serves as a creative consultant for a number of menswear and men's lifestyle businesses. He's worked with hundreds of brands, including names like Ralph Lauren, Nordstrom, Gillette, Allen Edmonds, etc. He's also been featured in dozens of major media publications like Esquire, GQ, and Men's Health.

“Dan Trepanier is a digital entrepreneur who is changing the way men think about style online.” -Men's Health

Alex CrawfordFashion PhotographerArt Director at TSBmen

""I grew up on a ranch just outside of Houston Texas, spending my weekdays shoveling manure for my mom and weekends hunting with my dad. Needless to say, my first experience with “fashion” was heavily influenced by utility and workwear.
After high school I left home to study photography at Belmont University in Nashville, TN. Moving to “Music City” had a huge influence on me; my artwork changed, my clothes changed, my drinking habits changed (and by changed I mean they didn’t exist before Nashville). I fell in love with Americana and classic Southern style.
After graduation I moved to New York City to work on a Masters in photography from Pratt University in Brooklyn. Shortly thereafter I was introduced to Dan, we hit it off, and TSB hasn't stopped growing since!"" 


TSBmen.com, formerly TheStyleBlogger, started as a small men's style blog written from a college dormroom. 
Today we are a full-time team of five in downtown NYC producing and publishing 100% original content for an audience of 1Million+ men (and women) from all over the world (190+ countries). 
Our website and brand is constantly evolving (as is the online content industry) but our goal remains the same: practical, relatable, and inspirational style advice for real guys. 
www.TSBmen.com



We've spent the past two months working closely with one of the leading website development firms here in NYC. We already have an hour-by-hour breakdown of what it will take to bring this new website to life. 
Our developers love the Style Guide concept and they're very excited to get started. 
All we need is funding to give them the green light! 

At $30K we can custom-build the new website as well as dramatically increase our photo library. 
At $50K we can build the Style Guide APP for iPhone, iPad, and Android. 
At $100K we can start building the functionality for members to catalogue their current wardrobes (easier outfit filtering, personalized product suggestions, etc) as well as upload their own outfits into the photo library (share with friends, get expert feedback, etc). 
At $200K we can begin expanding the social aspects of the Style Guide platform. Imagine checking out your friends' profiles, seeing what's new in their wardrobes, rating or commenting on their outfits, receiving instant feedback and/or suggestions on your outfits from friends or experts, etc.

INTRODUCING CINERAThe headset that’s about to disrupt the entire home theater industry. If you love movies, you know that home theaters have long been playing catch up with movie theaters themselves.Few things are more relaxing than watching the movies you love from the comfort of your own home, on your own time and without spending a dime.But when you manage to overcome the inconvenience and expense of getting into a movie theater, it’s a cinematic experience like no other.What’s a movie lover to do? With CINERA, You Can Have It All When you put on CINERA goggles, you enter another world.Imagine standing in the center of your favorite film. The action happening all around you, sound flying past your ears.Imagine combining your favorite stories and games with the immersive power of VR, regardless of genre and no matter how they were originally made.With CINERA, you can dive into it all, watch it all, play it all, hear it all. And you can do it from your own home. The CINERA DifferenceAt CINERA, we look at things differently.Instead of asking how we can make your home cinema more like a movie theater, we asked how we could make your home movie-watching, show-streaming, video-gaming experiences better?  All Of Your Favorite Media In Stunning Detail  Dual 2.5K Resolution (2560 x 1440 x 2)alWith ground-breaking dual 2.5K displays, CINERA is a pioneer in the headset industry. You’ll enjoy all your favorite media at a resolution 8X that of an iPhone 7+ . . . and 3X that of a movie theater screen! Check out this video to see what we mean. Get Into the Action with the Best 3D Before, the only way to get a high-quality 3D movie experience was at the theater. Now you can watch 3D even better from your couch.To give the illusion of 3D, most movie theaters project two distinct images onto the same screen through polarizing filters. Your big, plastic glasses filter out the images so one eye sees only one version.In this process, you lose more than 75% of the light—and the images never quite match up. This is why you often lose the crispness of the images, and why some people even feel nauseous. BETTER 3D THAN THE MOVIE THEATERCINERA's dual-screen architecture eliminates this problem entirely. Its native stereoscopic display system means each of your eyes has its own individual display panel and light path, there is no filter and no loss of quality. So you can to enjoy brighter, more vivid 3D images than ever before. 
See More Than Ever With Super-Wide Field of View  ENTHRALLING SCREEN SIZEA lot of the reason why movie theaters provide such an enthralling experience is because you feel immersed in the film.Typically this is done by making a physically larger screen. However, bigger doesn’t always mean better.Your vision consists of two portions: a central portion (30 degrees in either direction of the center), and a peripheral portion (the rest of your vision range).Even though we perceive objects in our peripheral area as blurred, making an experience truly immersive requires that the visuals extend into that space.After extensive testing, we believe we have found the perfect combination of clear image and the feeling of immersion: 66 degrees.Never Miss a Detail  Dual Screen SolutionMost existing headsets use a single screen and split it down the middle into left and right regions. This leaves each eye with a square-like peephole with an aspect ratio of 0.89.If you’re wondering why this feels so inadequate, it’s because most movies have an aspect ratio of 2.39. So when you play a movie on a typical headset, to keep the ratio, only about 47% of the screen can be used—rendering over half the pixels useless. With more than half the pixels out of commission, it’s no wonder the image quality suffers.To give you the highest quality display ever, CINERA provides an entire unique display panel for each eye. Each of these panels are optimized for movie-viewing, letting more than 95% of all the pixels shine.  More Pixels, More Quality . . . Or Not?You probably have heard of PPI, or Pixels Per Inch. (Most of us became familiar with the term thanks to Apple’ retina display.)While PPI can be a helpful stat, it doesn’t tell the entire store. PPI only illustrates the pixel density of a display—not necessarily what the human eye can actually see. Your sight can be affected by a handful of other factors, like distance to the display or optical lens.PIXELS PER DEGREE (PPD)Instead, a more efficient way to measure display quality is with PPD—Pixels Per Degree. PPD translates to the number of pixels per degree in human vision. The higher the number, the nicer quality image you get to enjoy. Here are a comparison of PPD between CINERA and several other headsets:   All of the Action, None of the Pressure  Enjoy CINERA with the Burden Free Arm *UPDATED ARM*We added an all-new functionality that allows the arm to connect to the goggles from either the top OR the bottom. Check out these short videos to watch it in action. Connect from the bottom to preserve space Or connect from the top for some more hand-to-mouth clearance.The last thing you want when you’re watching your favorite media to get fatigued.Most headsets require you to put the entire stress of their product on your head. This can be burdensome over long stretches of time, leading to discomfort or even health issues.We totally eliminate this problem, with hands-free CINERA arm.BRING THE POWER OF THE MOVIE THEATER TO YOUR COUCHFinally—the comfort of your couch with the high-quality movies you love. With the zero-stress hands-free arm, you’ll be more relaxed than ever.WATCH MOVIES HOW YOU WANTWith its a easy-to-use built in pump, you can move Cinera to practically any position without a lot of force. You’ll enjoy complete freedom—watch standing, sitting on your couch, or even lying down flat.PROTECT YOUR HAIR STYLEOkay, maybe it’s not the first thing you think of when you hear “movie experience.” But it’s true—headsets destroy hairdos.Someone’s solution was to shave his head! But don’t worry, we’re not going to let you go that far.

<p><b><i>Our Story</i></b></p>
<p>iSTYLEUP’s story
began in 2014. When I was planning a fashion incubation project, I spoke to and
analyzed what young designers need to launch a successful fashion label. What
is the key to success? Creativity? Well, absolutely. Design technique and handcrafting
talent? It is presumed they should have learned so in the institutions and only
experience would refine this. Business sense? Sure, but again, we couldn’t do
much for that, and experience is probably the only way to help them improve.
Marketing and PR? Yeah, bingo! This is the area that designers struggle with.
Not because they don’t know or can’t accumulate the knowledge, but because to
achieve this goal one needs money and resources! Can a fashion incubator help?
Yes, a bit of PR, but just short-term. In the long run, an incubator’s mission
and use of resources are not to assist designers in marketing their line,
especially after they have been out in the world for a while. Competitive
pricing? Here you go! I see so many designers that are great, but just high
quality designs alone cannot sell. Why? It’s the quantity issue. Designers
cannot place large quantity production orders because they don’t know how many
they can sell! It’s a chicken-and-egg loop – low quantities make costs high,
thus making the price high, therefore creating low sale volume. </p>
<p>What if we could
help designers to market products to the customers overseas directly? What if
we could help designers to finance their production cost when they got the
orders? What if we could let more people know and appreciate designer fashion?
By conglomerating designers of different characters, we could have more
resources and make a bigger impact on the market. That’s how iSTYLEUP
began.  </p>
<p>To once again summarize our
mission – <b>we connect talented designers with consumers, in a more direct and
appealing way. On top of that, we encourage exchange of fashion ideas and  inspirations among people. </b></p>
<p>Inspire, be inspired!</p>

<p>Introducing SmileRunner, the most affordable sports wristband with <strong>built-in GPS</strong> and a <strong>heart rate monitor</strong>, making your workouts more scientific and your results more accurate.

<h3>WHY SMILERUNNER?</h3>
<p>You need to collect comprehensive data to analyze and enhance your performance, but most of the wristbands on the market cannot provide everything you need. Other sports wristbands without built-in GPS need a smartphone app to connect GPS, but this limits the user’s freedom and movement. Lastly, they’re just flat-out expensive, heavy and uncomfortable.</p>
<p><strong>That's why you need SmileRunner, the only sports </strong><strong>wristband </strong><strong> that brings built-in</strong><strong> GPS, heart rate sensor and step counter altogether!</strong></p>

<p>SmileRunner tracks all of the data points you need to maximize your results. In the app, you can easily see all of the data you care with SmileRunner, including:</p>
<p><strong>Heart rate: </strong>Tracking your heart rate could take your training to the next level. The heart-rate training uses your heart rate as a guide for your training intensity. Using your heart rate, you will be able to train your cardiorespiratory system to work at a specific level for a set amount of time.</p>
<p><strong>Pace: </strong>Learning to properly pace yourself is one of the most critical skills a runner can develop.  SmileRunner tracks your running pace to help you understand and adjust your training plan.</p>
<p><strong>Steps per minute: </strong>steps per minute is<strong> </strong>essential for runners who want to know their running style and stress on knees, for example when spm increases from 155 to 180 (which is the best spm for marathon runners), the stress on knees will reduce for 25%. While many fitness trackers cannot track spm, SmileRunner can provide you your precise spm.</p>
<p>Besides, SmileRunner also tracks other important data such as<strong> distance traveled and calories burned.</strong></p>

</div></div>","Introducing SmileRunner, the most affordable sports wristband with built-in GPS and a heart rate monitor, making your workouts more scientific and your results more accurate. SmileRunner also features an HD color display, is IP68 waterproof, with multiple sports mode, and sleep monitor.

WHY SMILERUNNER?
You need to collect comprehensive data to analyze and enhance your performance, but most of the wristbands on the market cannot provide everything you need. Other sports wristbands without built-in GPS need a smartphone app to connect GPS, but this limits the user’s freedom and movement. Lastly, they’re just flat-out expensive, heavy and uncomfortable.
That's why you need SmileRunner, the only sports wristband  that brings built-in GPS, heart rate sensor and step counter altogether!
 


 
 


 


SmileRunner tracks all of the data points you need to maximize your results. In the app, you can easily see all of the data you care with SmileRunner, including:
Heart rate: Tracking your heart rate could take your training to the next level. The heart-rate training uses your heart rate as a guide for your training intensity. Using your heart rate, you will be able to train your cardiorespiratory system to work at a specific level for a set amount of time.
Pace: Learning to properly pace yourself is one of the most critical skills a runner can develop.  SmileRunner tracks your running pace to help you understand and adjust your training plan.
Steps per minute: steps per minute is essential for runners who want to know their running style and stress on knees, for example when spm increases from 155 to 180 (which is the best spm for marathon runners), the stress on knees will reduce for 25%. While many fitness trackers cannot track spm, SmileRunner can provide you your precise spm.
Besides, SmileRunner also tracks other important data such as distance traveled and calories burned.
 


Monitoring your heart rate is extremely important, especially for health enthusiasts like you. SmileRunner is here for you, making use of science to accurately track your heart rate and steps, breaking everything down to easy-to-understand statistics.
SmileRunner will tell you the amount of time you have been working out, your heart rate and its corresponding Heart Rate Training Zone (Z1-Z5). 


Just knowing your heart rate isn’t enough, which is why SmileRunner features five unique Heart Rate Training Zones, so you know where your pulse is at any given moment.  
Knowing your Heart Rate Training Zone will help you maximize your results. You’ll know when to speed up to kick your fat-burning system into overdrive, and when it’s time to take a break.
 



 
Unlike most fitness wristbands, the built-in GPS of SmileRunner allows you to locate yourself without your phone within 8 seconds, on empty fields. The MT2523 chip makes SmileRunner very accurate and reliable. This quick and straightforward feature will ensure you never lose your way and are always on the path to success.
 


 
SmileRunner provides both treadmill mode and running mode to satisfy your professional needs. With both indoor and outdoor running modes, you can use SmileRunner anywhere. Whether you’re jogging through the city, on an outdoor track, or even on a treadmill at the gym, you can track your pace and running data to stay on pace.
 
 

 



 
SmileRunner serves as your personal 24/7 fitness tracker. As you run, SmileRunner provides you with instant updates on:

your steps taken
calories you've burned
your heart rate
how much sleep you’ve gotten

 


While SmileRunner is specially designed for runners, any fitness lover can enjoy the full benefit and advanced functions of this sports wristband. With different sports modes for multiple sports, track your workout for whatever you’re doing today.

With SmileRunner, you can use specific modes to track your data:


Running (Outdoor) / Treadmill

Biking
Walking
Hiking
Skiing


 


You shouldn’t let rain or sweat ruin your workout. SmileRunner is IP68 waterproof meaning it’s perfectly capable in a downpour outside, in the shower, pool, or if you’re drenched in sweat from a personal record-breaking workout.
 
 

 



 
There's nothing worse than getting caught in a rainstorm halfway through a run. SmileRunner will keep you up to date with local weather, three days in advance.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Miguel A. Ramos of Somar Productions &amp; Promotions and James Williams Jr. of Poesidon Ave have teamed up to put together a project to promote our talents: Photography and Fashion Design<br/><br/> We both have start up companies that are wanting to share our abilities to the world!  In an area, where there are limited opportunities for high fashion photography, we've decided to make our own, but we need your help.  To up our game and quality level, we need professional models, crew, and equipment.  We know how much hard work it takes to pull of a shoot that will involve 6 looks in different locations in one day.  We need to be able to compensate our talented and hard working crew.  With your help we can create an awesome project that gives opportunity to much more than ourselves.  It gives a paid opportunity to the crew members and models to show their talents and get some recognition for their work.  The common dream with members of the creative community is to have their work seen by the world.  The pictures we make will be used by Somar Productions &amp; Promotions for its portfolio and hopefully leads to more work, which will in turn lead to more work for our crew.  Poesidon Ave will use the photos to promote its line of clothing online and in print.  This allows members of our shoot to say that their work has been used by a creditable designer and their work is out in the world.  We all want to live the dream!</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our current budget is half of our initial budget.  To achieve our goal and provide some financial compensation for our crew, we're hoping to acquire at least $800.  It's definitely a realistic goal and I know we can get there with your help.  Other expenses we are planning for are:</p>
<p>-casting location rental</p>
<p>-professional models</p>
<p>-permits</p>
<p>-food and beverage for the crew (Florida Summers are hot! Got to have water)</p>
<p>-lighting equipment</p>
<p>-additional camera lenses</p>
<p>-behind the scenes video</p>
<p>Every little bit helps and every dollar will go to the shoot, even if we don't reach $800 and have to scale back the shoot.  But that just means we have less people working and missing out on a paid opportunity. </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>   There's so much talent in Central Florida and we want to show the world what we're capable of.  People here have a great love for fashion, photography, and the arts.  We have all had to pay our dues and do some freebie projects in our life.  We want to do something different for our crew (as we know they all have a living to make) and compensate them for their amazing talents and hard work.  We're all not ones to sit around and wait for opportunities.  There comes a time to put your tools together, call your connections, and get the ball rolling yourself and see your goals come to fruition.  You are our connections.   We're very ready to get going and we need your help.  It's our hope that when others see the caliber of work, the photos will generate more work for us and our crew.  Can you be the person to help provide an opportunity?</p>
<p>   We want to thank you for any contribution you give us.  Please check out the different contributions levels to see some of the great gifts we have, like a custom tailored swim suit (female or male) from Poesidon Ave, autographed photos from the models to be chosen for the shoot, different hair and beauty packages form our Lead Hair &amp; Make-up stylist Lesley Rivera, as well as gift certificates for jewelry from Evecesories, the official accessories provider for our photo shoot!</p>
</div>
<p>     If you can't contribute financially that's ok.  We would still love for you to be apart of journey.  Please get the word out to those you know through your social medias or any way you can share the message.  Just in case anyone can get us a billboard ad. for free, I'll be forever grateful and treat you out to many dinners.  As for the rest of you..... use the Indiegogo share tools below and help us shout out to the world.  Thank you all!</p></div>","Short Summary
Miguel A. Ramos of Somar Productions & Promotions and James Williams Jr. of Poesidon Ave have teamed up to put together a project to promote our talents: Photography and Fashion Design We both have start up companies that are wanting to share our abilities to the world!  In an area, where there are limited opportunities for high fashion photography, we've decided to make our own, but we need your help.  To up our game and quality level, we need professional models, crew, and equipment.  We know how much hard work it takes to pull of a shoot that will involve 6 looks in different locations in one day.  We need to be able to compensate our talented and hard working crew.  With your help we can create an awesome project that gives opportunity to much more than ourselves.  It gives a paid opportunity to the crew members and models to show their talents and get some recognition for their work.  The common dream with members of the creative community is to have their work seen by the world.  The pictures we make will be used by Somar Productions & Promotions for its portfolio and hopefully leads to more work, which will in turn lead to more work for our crew.  Poesidon Ave will use the photos to promote its line of clothing online and in print.  This allows members of our shoot to say that their work has been used by a creditable designer and their work is out in the world.  We all want to live the dream!
 


What We Need & What You Get
Our current budget is half of our initial budget.  To achieve our goal and provide some financial compensation for our crew, we're hoping to acquire at least $800.  It's definitely a realistic goal and I know we can get there with your help.  Other expenses we are planning for are:
-casting location rental
-professional models
-permits
-food and beverage for the crew (Florida Summers are hot! Got to have water)
-lighting equipment
-additional camera lenses
-behind the scenes video
Every little bit helps and every dollar will go to the shoot, even if we don't reach $800 and have to scale back the shoot.  But that just means we have less people working and missing out on a paid opportunity.

Risks & Challenges



After multiple years of planning, designing, and research, we are at a point that allows us to confidently give out our launch date.  As we all know, some things/situations can cause delays that were never intended or could have been prepared for.  To prevent this outcome, we are committed to securing multiple resources when it comes to our supply-chain and assembly.  At a minimum, we will have the redundancy of two suppliers of any given component including assembly.  If for any reason there is a delay that could potentially occur of any kind, we will communicate this immediately.  We will also be updating every backer consistently on every step of progress we take to completion.  
Our team is committed to making StoneTether an exceptional device with great support.  We consider customer service and product quality to be the hallmark of true success for a company.  We are absolutely certain that StoneTether will be a success thanks to your support.",21.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p></p>
<p>Every time I entered the pet store trying to find a perfect collar 
  for my best friend, all I ever found was the same style, same width,  
 same colours and designs. I’m sure you have had the same experience.   
Sitting behind a borrowed sewing machine for the fourth time in my life,
   armed with tons of patience, creativity, the moonlight and the warmth
   of my dog sleeping on my foot, my first Pawfect collar was made. </p>
<div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""315"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/GtmVFi7xATc?rel=0"" width=""560""></iframe></div>
<p>All of our products are handmade and customized to meet our   customers’
 unique requirements.  They are made with love, passion and   dedication
 because our friends are worth it. Like the fox said to Little   Prince,
 “You become forever responsible for what you have tamed.""</p>

<h4>What If </h4> 

In case we won't reach our target, we are still going ahead, it just won't be so easy for us like with the full funding. We would spend it primarily for creating new designs and parts for collars, for the web development and promotions, to get word spread out about our unique products. Then we would like to upgrade our laptops, that are old enough for replacement to assure we can be creative. We won't be able to visit Trade show expo and it will take a while to be able to afford new sewing machine.<br/><ul></ul>

Thank to your contribution we will get the chance to show to all dog lovers that their four legged friend can wear cosy, stylish and handmade product that is really special, because it is individually measured and designed by your unique taste. The feature that makes it comfy and cosy is the special width of the collar that is not common. Some breeds and their owners really enjoy the comfort and safety that our products with wider designs provide. Your trust in our business will make the dog world a bit more colourful, glowing and cosy.</p>
<p>Our first designs became very popular among our friends and lot of dog owners we kept meeting while we walked our dog. We have dozens of orders in pipeline already, but we have decided to get engaged with Indiegogo campaign first to kick off the idea of our unique collars.</p>
<p>We are ready to meet your high level requirements for your own design collar straight away and you can choose among 2 types of collar, 4 different widths, 24 buckle colours and 40+ fabric designs within our current portfolio.<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> </p>
<p>Relative to our business we are confident that we will keep working on our
project and can fulfil all the orders and requirements that we receive. Within
the reason of course. Because we won't make anything, that will lower our
quality, safety of our products and design values.</p>
<p>Our designs were already tested in harsh environment - our dog (95pound cross
Vizsla) is pretty good testing professional, and all his encounters with
his enemies were stopped safely by our collars and leashes. </p>
<p>Though we can see only one challenge among the business and that's' to fulfil
all orders after 10th of December to be fulfilled by Christmas. Because of that,
orders will be prioritized for Indiegogo fund-raisers.</p>
<p>However, we have already confirmed backup for extra workforce and as well
projected supply orders to overcome this risk.</p>

<p style=""font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5em; font-weight: 300px;"">The Union Wallet is a minimalist wood wallet that carries your cards, cash, and small miscellaneous essentials in an elegant slim profile shell. It is designed as a slim alternative to leather, elastic, or metal wallets - with the look and feel only wood can bring. Without sacrificing function.</p>

<p style=""font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5em; font-weight: 300px;"">The Union wallet hold your essentials comfortably. With elastic slits that will allow you to securely carry small neccessities, such as an SD card or a spare key. Downsizing your pocket has never been this easy.</p>

<p style=""font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5em; font-weight: 300px;"">With innovative use of injection molded elastomer, we are able to create a slim wood wallet with all the desirable function of a minimalist wallet. The Union wallet measures 9mm (0.35"") thick. With width and length of 71mm (2.8"") and 101mm (4.0"") respectively.</p>

The Union wallet is slim, made from a unique wood piece, and elegantly carries your essentials.

MEET THE UNION WALLET
The Union Wallet is a minimalist wood wallet that carries your cards, cash, and small miscellaneous essentials in an elegant slim profile shell. It is designed as a slim alternative to leather, elastic, or metal wallets - with the look and feel only wood can bring. Without sacrificing function.



MODERN ESSENTIALS
The Union wallet hold your essentials comfortably. With elastic slits that will allow you to securely carry small neccessities, such as an SD card or a spare key. Downsizing your pocket has never been this easy.

Union wallet can hold up to six cards for the pure card-carrying minimalist.

Use it as an emergency coin holder minus the jingling.

Keep things simple, by placing your most frequently used card at the front, to stop you from fumbling at the till.




WOOD X ELASTOMER
With innovative use of injection molded elastomer, we are able to create a slim wood wallet with all the desirable function of a minimalist wallet. The Union wallet measures 9mm (0.35"") thick. With width and length of 71mm (2.8"") and 101mm (4.0"") respectively.




RFID SHIELDING
The Union wallet is fitted with an RFID blocking aluminium plate below the wood surface - to help shield your RF contactless cards from skimmers.




TIMELESS
Wood being one the planet's oldest raw material will age gracefully, unlike the familiar tired old leather.




SECURE & EASY ACCESS
The Union wallet is designed to securely hold your cards even as you're pulling them out. We love minimalist wallet but dislike fumbling through the stack of cards, and on rare occassions dropping the mess on the floor.




MEET CHERRY & WALNUT
Our two wood selections. Warm cherry and dark walnut, are well known for their durability and resistance to decay. More importantly our wood is harvested from responsibly managed and sustainable forests.


PERKS



RESPONSIBILITY
We believe in our (and your) responsiblity for the planet. With every Union wallet sold, we will be planting a tree with the good folks at plantabillion.org - to help offset carbon footprints created in manufacturing and distribution. Our packaging will be made from paper/cardboards, so at the other end you'll be able to do your part - and recycle every bit of unwanted packaging.




PRODUCTION SCHEDULE
After a few months of intensive prototyping, we have arrived at a finalised form/function that we are satisfied with. With a successful demand at Indiegogo, we will rapidly move to manufacturing plans and delivery.

May: Final product refinements.
June: Finalise manufacturing requirements & place order.
July: Quality control procedure.
August: Final QC checks and delivery.




RISK & CHALLENGES
We have dedicated countless of hours working together with our experienced manufacturer, trying to mitigate as much risks in all aspects of the product. Although we understand that there will be unexpected challenges along the way, we are confident that we will be able to deliver as per our projected plan. We will keep things transparent and inform our supporters of any hurdles/delay along the way.



FAQ
How do I select the wood type for my wallet?
After selecting one of the pledges, please send an email to holler@madera.com.au

Make sure you use or mention the Paypal/Credit card credential you use to pledge with.
With the subject line: Union Wallet Supporter: My [Walnut or Cherry] Wallet.
We'll send confirmation email of your selection.
Wait in excitement for the Union wallet!

I forgot to add shipping cost. What do I do?
You can still contribute shipping cost on top of your current pledge by clicking the pink ‘CONTRIBUTE NOW’ button and add the $8 on top of your current contribution. Easy!

A BETTER FIT
57% of us don’t know what size to order, are left disappointed with
  off the rack fit but are filled with dread at taking our own measurements and having something custom made.
So we have developed 3 sizing options to cater for everyone.


AURZA STANDARD SIZES from UK 8-20. Thanks to our 5% stretch and clever 3D pattern development we think that this will be a great solution for the majority of women. Our size charts will guide you but if you are still unsure you can just send us a full length picture of yourself  with your height and we can tell your size (See FAQ).


AURZA MIX AND MATCH tops and skirts for those that want a separates look or have very different top and bottom body shapes


AURZA CUSTOM SIZING provide your measurements (with our guidance) and we will make you a unique size dress


WHY WE NEED YOU
For the last 12 months we’ve been
  working with manufacturers, testing materials and finalising samples to develop our current range of dresses and
  sizes.

We now need
  your help to extend the range of sizes from 8 to 20 (UK) and to optimise our 3D design builder. Please help us to make
  this a reality!

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>We love Sports watches and we know many you will agree all sports watches available in the market today look the same when it comes to material used or in terms of looks. <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">We are big fans of wood products and we have seen other wood watches out there. They are very nice looking and trendy but we found 2 problems with them:</span></p>
<p>1. Either they are too light weight and don't give a real watch feel when you put them on wrist Or</p>
<p>2. They are too bulky (Newer ones), feels too big on the wrist.</p>
<p>We wanted some middle ground, without these 2 problems, so we decided to design our own Sporty Chronograph Watch that would feel right on the wrist. Watch we could wear both in casual and professional setting and still be distinctive.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/27980/files/20130822122444-on_Wrist_Espresso_Kick.png?1377199484"" src="""" style=""line-height: 1.45em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;""/><br/></p>

<p><b>Our Goal</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">When we set out to create our first collection of watches, our goal was simple: Create a good quality watch that makes a unique style statement and has a Sporty look. So we started working with our in house designers and professional watch designers. The design of WC Sport has been created entirely from ground up by our team of designers. We are collaborating with a very reputed manufacturer to create our initial prototypes who we'll be using for our production run as well. </span></p>
<p>We are proud to say we are on the path of achieving what we were looking for with our first model “WC SPORT"" prototypes. We incorporated the contemporary appeal of natural wood detailing and infused the weight and strength of stainless steel for a durable and fully functional design. The weight of the watch had to be the right weight so it was critical to have the right size bezel, inlays in the links had to be perfectly sized as well. In order to achieve this we decreased the width of band to 22mm (Most other had 24mm) with two 4mm wood inlays and bezel size to 8mm.</p>
<p><strong>All watches in our collection will be made out of all natural wood and stainless steel. WC SPORT will come with a Japanese Chronograph movement, first of its kind double wood inlay stainless steel band, battery life of approx. 5 years, 5ATM (50 meters/160feet) Water Resistant and 2 year warranty. </strong></p>

reinforcing the idea: “If you can see it, you can be it.”<br/><br/>Solmaz is contacted periodically by athletes and
media seeking her guidance and expertise. In July 2013, Iranian
swimmer Elham Asghari sought advice to contest a 20 km swimming
record and expressed the necessity for a media outlet, such as
Shirzanan, where both the struggles and successes of females could be
exposed, debated and celebrated accordingly.  The reputations of
Solmaz and Shirzanan remain strong in the Muslim athletic community
and its established supporters.<br/><br/>See more about Elham Asghari here:  <br/><a href=""https://www.change.org/petitions/international-swimming-federation-demand-iran-register-elham-s-swimming-record"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.change.org/petitions/international-swimming-federation-demand-iran-register-elham-s-swimming-record</a><br/><br/>We highly recommend the following video and article published by

<p>During the whole campaign, do not hesitate to make your own suggestions for new designs. We might produce one of those, in which case, the originator of the idea would receive the first one out of production for free.</p>
<p>We want to create an ongoing relationship with our backers, not only because we feel indebted to you but because we would like you to share your own wishes and dreams with us. </p>
<h1>Who is behind it all ?</h1>
<p>Started initially as a hobby by myself a few years ago, then discontinued due to a lack of funds, I have recently re-initiated the collection with the fresh and creative help of my son, Alex. </p>
<p>We have shared a keen interest for aviation our entire lives and decided to materialize our interest into something tangible, useful, attractive and accessible to all. </p>
<p>Our interest in the exciting world of aviation was triggered by aviation stories from my father, Alex's grandfather, a decorated WW2 aviator. He can be seen at the link below:</p>

<p>That is why we have also released a limited edition of WW2 watches, the Cockpit Belle and the Sack Time, to honor his wartime accomplishments.  </p>

While we are very grateful to the companies listed above, cash flow caused by payment terms makes it difficult for Cockpit Company to advance the funds needed for the creation of new designs and new stock. 
Your contribution will help us solve this issue and get you a very unique item you will no doubt brag about for a long time.
You will get the ultimate perk:  a unique Flight Deck watch for a unique price.
If you are one of the many fans the aviation world counts, then you will have to have this watch. If not, it is highly probable you know someone who is a fan and who would love to receive this Flight Deck watch as a gift.
Reserve one now before they go on sale for $100, still a reasonable amount but double the amount of our perks. You have the 2 models below to chose from:










Watch Specifications:


Case Material:  Stainless SteelCase Length: 58 mmCase Width: 45 mmStrap: very comfortable siliconeDial Window Material: Crystal GlassDisplay: AnalogMovements: Japanese Quartz
Date Function
Water Resistant: 3 ATM




 Shipping



USA and Canada: when you chose a $50 watch, delivery is included to both the USA and Canada in that price.

Worldwide: when you chose a $60 watch, delivery is included to any other country in the world.

So there is no need to add any other cost in our already low pricing.

Our future .... together ?

We want to create a full collection of aviation watches that stay at an AFFORDABLE cost. So why don't you join us on this journey and be a part of it every step of the way?  We will send out several updates throughout the entire process making sure our backers are up-to-date on any important information. 
During the whole campaign, do not hesitate to make your own suggestions for new designs. We might produce one of those, in which case, the originator of the idea would receive the first one out of production for free.
We want to create an ongoing relationship with our backers, not only because we feel indebted to you but because we would like you to share your own wishes and dreams with us. 
Who is behind it all ?
Started initially as a hobby by myself a few years ago, then discontinued due to a lack of funds, I have recently re-initiated the collection with the fresh and creative help of my son, Alex. 
We have shared a keen interest for aviation our entire lives and decided to materialize our interest into something tangible, useful, attractive and accessible to all. 
Our interest in the exciting world of aviation was triggered by aviation stories from my father, Alex's grandfather, a decorated WW2 aviator. He can be seen at the link below:
http://www.b26.com/marauderman/jean_annez_de_taboada.htm
That is why we have also released a limited edition of WW2 watches, the Cockpit Belle and the Sack Time, to honor his wartime accomplishments.

<h2><strong>""No one is making undershirts in America anymore...""</strong></h2>
<p>I heard this repeatedly when trying to find a U.S. supplier. So we had no choice but to start from scratch!</p>
<h2><strong>Now we're making undershirts in America and Guys across the country are asking for MORE!</strong></h2>
<p>Starting from scratch allowed us to use higher quality materials that aren’t found in your typical undershirt. Because of this, Guys started asking for a 'regular' Thompson Tee to wear on occasions they didn't need the extra protection!</p>
<h3><strong>THE PROBLEM:</strong></h3>
<p>We have a product that solves a global need. We've turned down investment offers requiring us to move production overseas. Funding is needed to expand domestic operations and product options. We believe in American manufacturing and the ethical treatment of garment workers, so we're looking for your help to stay here!</p>
<p>The U.S. undershirt market is comprised of 65 million people and <strong>not a single major brand</strong> is made here. Outsourced unregulated foreign sewing contractors takes a huge toll on jobs in America, human lives abroad, and global pollution.</p>
<h3><strong>THE SOLUTION:</strong></h3>
<p>Raise the funds to expand our existing domestic operations and product offerings. We need at least $25,000 to cover the material minimums and labor to launch the Classic Tee and expand our colors to include Black.<br/><br/>For every <strong>2,000</strong> shirts we make each month, <strong>one job</strong> will be added to our supply chain!<br/><br/>Ultimately, our goal is to evolve into a true, classic American lifestyle brand made entirely in the U.S.A. and it can all start with a simple Tee!</p>

They don't always make hot styles for my kind so I'm often relegated to wearing the basics. But...add big hoop earrings, a necklace, a bracelet or two or ten and a pair of shoes that take your breath away and you go from bland to grand! So I scour the internet for hours at a time looking for fresh little luxuries that I haven't seen a million times or in a million places, and use those pieces to bring my look to life. Then, when I hear the compliments and ""that is soooo cute"" and ""OMG where did you get that?"" I feel great. It reaffirms my sense of style, makes me feel special and makes me proud. Queens of Fancy will bring this feeling to our customers. Our ladies will know that when they visit our site they will find something they love and their watchers will take note. This swanky online shoppe will feature eclectic, eye-popping women's fashion accessories and the assortment, presentation and customer experience are our primary focus. We specialize in ""Urban Opulence"", a phrase we've coined to describe extravagant, trendsetting style and limited edition items that are tightly distributed and procured directly from the artisans. Queens of Fancy - beyond the ordinary.I feel like I have been preparing for this my whole career, my whole life even. With nearly 15 years of professional experience in retail and ecommerce, a keen eye for desirable product and merchandising and the right timing, Queens of Fancy is the next critical play. It was last June when the idea really started to take shape. I hit the ground running on the road from a mere spark to a bona fide retail concept. Now, it's execution time! Your contribution will help breathe life into this adventure and aid the launch of QueensofFancy.com.A lot must happen between now and the launch of the site in April. Since this is an online business we need powerful computer hardware, a versatile ecommerce platform with advanced functionality, packing and shipping supplies, systems for managing financials and inventory, and well, inventory! My personal financial investment plus the funds raised through this campaign will cover these start-up costs and help us maintain positive cash flow throughout the year.What do YOU get out of this? Well think about it...Nasty Gal was started on eBay in 2006 by a woman who just wanted to sell some of her vintage finds online - now it is a profitable $100 million business! Threadless was started in 2000 by two guys with $1,000 and an idea to sell cool T-shirts. Today it is a multi-million dollar business shipping over a hundred thousand T-shirts each month! Wouldn't you love to be part of a story like that?! Help us out and you will have this story to tell. The amount doesn't matter - every single dollar brings us a step closer to the goal and I thank you. All donors will be recognized on a dedicated donor page on the site* and receive an exclusive promo once we launch. And if you choose to help out with one of our signature pledges (to the right) you will get some other phenomenal perks** courtesy of Queens of Fancy!Again, any and all contributions help and are deeply appreciated, but if you can't contribute financially you can still help.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Tableau D'Hôte Theatre has always placed great importance on the value of strong set, costume, lights, and sound
designs in our productions.  Despite the fact that we are a
self-financed independent operation, we have strived to provide our
designers with resources to create universes that transport our
audiences, often making them forget the venue they are actually in.</p>
<p><br/></p>
Our production of Humans, which opens in February, is being produced only two months after our least successful box-office production in
6 years. As such, we need an extra boost of cash flow to help our
designers bring their world to life. <p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Lara Kaluza, set dseigner for Humans, received a Montréal English Critics' Circle Award for
her design of our March 2010 production of 'A Line In the Sand'.  She
is a brilliant up-and-coming designer and without your help the world
she has dreamed up for Humans would be greatly compromised. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Noémi Poulin has been designing for Tableau D'Hôte Theatre since
2006. As our artist-in-residence, she has played a huge role in overseeing
the visual artistic integrity and synergy of 16 productions.  </p>
<p><br/></p>
Your contribution would directly aid in the creation of a beautiful
homogeneous design. A work of art that exists for the world
of 'Humans' but also stands as a work of art in and of itself.  <p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The set design for Humans is estimated to cost close to $3,000.  Some of the costs include:<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Risers: $140<br/>Moveable Block: $340<br/>Cardboard Boxes: $125<br/>Cyc Rentals: $600<br/>Projectors Rentals: $300<br/>Paint: $200<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>While every donation helps (even a single dollar!), we have also included various perks to heighten the deal. Check 'em out on the side!<br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Our Recent 'Tableau
D'Hôte Theatre Fundraising Drive' campaign was a smashing success due
entirely to the fact that it was DIWO. Do. It. With. Others. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Dozens of people shared the information about the campaign on their
facebook wall, tweeted about it, blogged about it, and with their help
we raised over $3, 250 that allowed for us to pay off debt and have
some cash-flow for Humans.</p>

<p>It is with your referrals that crowdfunding works. We are stronger together than we are alone.  </p>

While on vacation in Italy I came across colorful and high quality resin-based components for art and crafts. Immediately I thought ""those would make great pendants!""
As the geek that I am, I did not want to do just another necklace, I wanted to do an innovative necklace with the ability to let the customer decide with colors to choose from.
I am proud to present to you the result of my effort: the Xircado Berlin Design Jewelry.

Xircado is a new kind of fashion jewelry where you can design pendants to mix and match your own style. The mix and match jewelry is a new and innovative, like you have never seen before. Key factors:


You select the colors of your pendants (2 included) - 8.000 combinations!
Innovative magnetic locking mechanism
Nylon-coated necklace Titanium wire - virtually indestructable
Comes with storage pouch in 3 beautiful colors
Handmade with love and dedication in Berlin, Germany






 http://www.Xircado.com/selector

 


Each Early Bird, Starter Pack and Swarowski limited Editions contain the items listed here:

2 pendants where you choose a unique color combination
1 necklace wire (3 different lenghts to choose from)
1 felt pouch in red, black or charcoal
worldwide shipping with no additional charges
Mum and Me Combos have 2 necklaces, 2 pouches and 4 pendants, Awesome Pack has 3 necklaces, 3 pouches and 6 pendants.


The necklace comes with exchangable pendants - each pendant consists of the outer ring, the inner ring and the pearl in the center. There are 20 colors for each of the 3 which totals in 8.000 unique combinations you can choose from.
 


 
What makes Xircado special is the magnetic locking mechanism intergrated in the pendant. No more itching clasps, no fiddling, sits perfectly. The magnets used here are epoxy-coated, safe for your skin and strong enough for a secure fit.

Xircado also features a delicate but durable wire made from Nylon-coated Titanium - which is super-strong, yet lightweight and almost kink-free. There are 3 lenghts you can choose from. 
Xircado comes with a beautiful pouch made of felt which is available in different colors. Everything is handmade in Berlin, Germany, with high quality materials from ltaly and the USA.
 

Xircado is suitable for many occasions, because you can mix and match it to your wardrobe and it never goes out of style.
May it be Casual, Sports, Party, Business or formal dinner - Xircado pendants are always your stylish companion.

<h2>Short Summary</h2>
<p>My name is Ilze Anna, and welcome to the IndieGoGo campaign page for OtakuPolish, nail polish made just for anime lovers! OtakuPolish is Big 3-Free, Handmade with love, and ALWAYS cruelty free.<br/>OtakuPolish started as a middle-of-the-night flash of inspiration just as I was falling asleep - what a great idea - POLISH INSPIRED BY ANIME!</p>
<p>Three months later, OtakuPolish is in it's current iteration! I have my own Etsy, twitter, tumblr, and website (in progress) on my own domain (!), and <em>I have successfully made <strong>(and sold out of!)</strong> my first line.</em></p>
<p>Unfortunately, the school year has started again, and I am unable to fund the creation of any more polish. I'm a poor college student who goes to school full time, and I'm currently trying to move out of an awful apartment (I get woken up every day at 6AM, and hear banging till 11PM or later at night, with a manager who won't do anything to help me.) Between regular bills, upkeep on my car, and groceries, it's tough to say I'll even have a chance to move, even though my grades and health are suffering from the stress and lack of sleep. <strong>This is where YOU come in. Yes, you, my wonderful reader! :3</strong></p>
<h3>With the help of a successful campaign, I will be able to:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Make more polish! </li>
<li>Make not just mini bottles - full size bottles as well!</li>
<li>I will be able to take enough time off work to make polish AND do my homework, AND pay my bills - and maybe even move too!</li>
<li>Make <em>more than one line at a time</em>, and keep a bigger stock than I've ever had before!</li>
<li>I will be able to even do things like <em>giveaways and promotions, coupons, etc</em>, to pass on savings to my customers! ^_^</li>
<li>Properly prepare for and stock up for the holiday season</li>
<li>Expand my sights and look into selling in other locations such as
<ul>
<li>the anime club at my university</li>
<li>Anime Conventions and similar meetings</li>
<li>Beauty trade shows and industry events</li>
<li>""Japanese lifestyle"" stores</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>This is the reason I have set my deadline to relatively soon - I would love to be able to try and stock up for the holiday season, because I've heard from many that my polish would be great as a gift, thanks to my packaging. :3</em></p>
<p>Currently, I have four lines planned, each with four polishes- with recipes!, and many many more jotted down as drafts!</p>
<p><strong>Neon Genesis Evangelion<br/></strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Asuka Line</span><br/><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Eva Line</span></p>
<p><strong>Studio Ghibli<br/></strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Totoro Line</span><br/><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Howl's Moving Castle Line</span></p>
<p>See down for descriptions of each line!</p>
<p>I also have many, many more lines in various stages of planning. However, the funding I am asking for would allow me to create <em>at least</em> these. There might be minor changes from the drawing board to reality, however I know what I want to see in each polish, and how I want to try to best capture each character, creature, or item so pivotal to the world in which it resides. </p>
<h2> </h2>
<h2><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>What I Need &amp; What You Get</strong></span></h2>
<h3>My Goal: $1000</h3>
<p>I am asking for $1000, in flexible funding. </p>
</div>
<p>""Flexible funding"" means that even if I do not reach my goal, I still receive the money I have been donated till then. (However, the percentage taken by IndieGoGo is more than twice as high if I do not meet my goal. That is a risk I am willing to take. :c)</p>
<p>I realize that this can seem like a daunting number, but allow me to put it in perspective! <strong>If just 77 people donate $13, I will reach my goal!</strong> That's not so hard, right? :3 </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">I am planning to use the funds I receive to make 16 of each polish colour in minis (7ml), and 4 of each polish in full size (15ml) for each line (2 Eva lines and 2 Ghibli lines.)<em><br/></em><strong>This translates into 16 mini bottle four-packs, and 4 of each full-size color sold individually, PER LINE.<br/></strong>In total, this will be 256 mini bottles of polish and 64 full size bottles.</p>

I hope you will all forgive me for not mentioning details, as I'd like to keep the individual recipe specifications secret until I have a chance to present them! ^^;; It's also for the sake of brevity, and as a sort of insurance plan, just in case!<br/><strong>If you donate, and want to know details about the polish(es) you choose - you can e-mail me at <a href=""mailto:otakupolish@yahoo.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">otakupolish@yahoo.com </a>and I will tell you everything you want to know! &lt;3</strong></p>

<h2>The Impact</h2>
<p>I love nail polish, and I love anime. I know that there are plenty of otakus out there who would love to wear polish inspired by their favorite characters - the awesome array of anime-inspired nail art proves it! The internet has welcomed The Age Of The Geek, and I love it for that. Where else would I find other people who love polish, and anime, just as much as me?! I hope to bridge the gap between the two camps, and reach out to all the otakus painting Totoros on their nails and reblogging every Naruto gif on tumblr ever.</p>
<p>I also love the indie nail polish community. It's a truly awesome thing to see the amazing inventions that people come up with, and the creativity is just spectacular. I would love to add my humble shop to the mix, and hopefully carve out a niche for myself.</p>
<p><em>I have already proven myself to be a successful polish-maker.</em> I have sold out of my first line and received only positive feedback. I have had my polish reviewed by several bloggers, all of whom were enthusiastic and excited to see more. I have so many ideas I would love to get to making, and it's frustrating to not have the funds to get started. With your help, I can make not just the lines outlined above, but more still! The world of anime is huge and unexplored, and I have plenty I'd love to see made into nail polish.</p>
<p>Some ideas for future lines include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Naruto</li>
<li>Cowboy Bebop</li>
<li>Sailor Moon</li>
<li>Love Hina</li>
<li>Inuyasha</li>
<li>5cm Per Second</li>
<li>Gundam Wing</li>
<li>Chobits</li>
<li>Honey &amp; Clover</li>
<li>Ah! My Goddess</li>
</ul>
<p>With your help, I'll be able to make all these and more! </p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
My name is Ilze Anna, and welcome to the IndieGoGo campaign page for OtakuPolish, nail polish made just for anime lovers! OtakuPolish is Big 3-Free, Handmade with love, and ALWAYS cruelty free.OtakuPolish started as a middle-of-the-night flash of inspiration just as I was falling asleep - what a great idea - POLISH INSPIRED BY ANIME!
Three months later, OtakuPolish is in it's current iteration! I have my own Etsy, twitter, tumblr, and website (in progress) on my own domain (!), and I have successfully made (and sold out of!) my first line.
Unfortunately, the school year has started again, and I am unable to fund the creation of any more polish. I'm a poor college student who goes to school full time, and I'm currently trying to move out of an awful apartment (I get woken up every day at 6AM, and hear banging till 11PM or later at night, with a manager who won't do anything to help me.) Between regular bills, upkeep on my car, and groceries, it's tough to say I'll even have a chance to move, even though my grades and health are suffering from the stress and lack of sleep. This is where YOU come in. Yes, you, my wonderful reader! :3
With the help of a successful campaign, I will be able to:

Make more polish! 
Make not just mini bottles - full size bottles as well!
I will be able to take enough time off work to make polish AND do my homework, AND pay my bills - and maybe even move too!
Make more than one line at a time, and keep a bigger stock than I've ever had before!
I will be able to even do things like giveaways and promotions, coupons, etc, to pass on savings to my customers! ^_^
Properly prepare for and stock up for the holiday season
Expand my sights and look into selling in other locations such as

the anime club at my university
Anime Conventions and similar meetings
Beauty trade shows and industry events
""Japanese lifestyle"" stores



This is the reason I have set my deadline to relatively soon - I would love to be able to try and stock up for the holiday season, because I've heard from many that my polish would be great as a gift, thanks to my packaging. :3
Currently, I have four lines planned, each with four polishes- with recipes!, and many many more jotted down as drafts!
Neon Genesis EvangelionAsuka LineEva Line
Studio GhibliTotoro LineHowl's Moving Castle Line
See down for descriptions of each line!
I also have many, many more lines in various stages of planning. However, the funding I am asking for would allow me to create at least these. There might be minor changes from the drawing board to reality, however I know what I want to see in each polish, and how I want to try to best capture each character, creature, or item so pivotal to the world in which it resides. 
 
What I Need & What You Get
My Goal: $1000
I am asking for $1000, in flexible funding. 

""Flexible funding"" means that even if I do not reach my goal, I still receive the money I have been donated till then. (However, the percentage taken by IndieGoGo is more than twice as high if I do not meet my goal. That is a risk I am willing to take. :c)
I realize that this can seem like a daunting number, but allow me to put it in perspective! If just 77 people donate $13, I will reach my goal! That's not so hard, right? :3 
I am planning to use the funds I receive to make 16 of each polish colour in minis (7ml), and 4 of each polish in full size (15ml) for each line (2 Eva lines and 2 Ghibli lines.)This translates into 16 mini bottle four-packs, and 4 of each full-size color sold individually, PER LINE.In total, this will be 256 mini bottles of polish and 64 full size bottles.
My Planned Lines:
Neon Genesis Evangelion 
Asuka Line (I had made this already - and it Sold Out!) - Four polishes featuring my favorite anime character

Asuka 001 - The Fiery Redhead (Asuka her wonderful self!)

Red and copper micro glitter with blue, copper and gold accents


Asuka 002 - The Yellow Dress (Her softer side... it exists!)

Pale golden micro glitter with blue, pink, and gold accents


Asuka 003 - Big Red Doll (Her sometimes-cooperative Evangelion)

Red micro glitter with green, and black&white matte diamond accents


Asuka 004 - Basic Thermodynamics (The infamous ""Swimsuit Scene"" ^_~)

Red and white glitter top coat, produces a dot-like effect


Eva Line - Four polishes featuring major characters/plot devices in the anime

Eva 001 - Child of the Moon (Because who doesn't love Ayanami Rei??)

Pale blue glitter with white and red accents


Eva 002 - Captain Katsuragi (Our favorite outgoing drunk with a dark past)

Deep plum glitter with red, teal, and silver accents


Eva 003 - A Mother's Love (Unit 01 themed polish, ooh spoiler(?) name!)

Bright purple glitter with lime, yellow, black, and red accents


Eva 004 - School of Pilot Children (A polish inspired by the girls' school uniforms)

Teal glitter with white and red accents


Studio Ghibli
Totoro Line - Four polishes inspired by arguably Studio Ghibli's most popular work

Totoro 001 - Keeper of the Forest (Totoro his big, cuddly flying self)

Pale and dark grey glitter with loads of sparkly accents


Totoro 002 - Cat Bus (Everyone's favorite mode of transportation!)

Deep yellow and copper glitter with gold and brown accents


Totoro 003 - Tsukamori (The magical forest in which Totoro and his chibi-selves reside)

Deep green and light green glitter with green and more green accents. Green!


Totoro 003 - Mei (The little sister, still innocent to the ways of the world)

Bright coral/salmon glitter with yellow and gold accents

Howl's Moving Castle Line - Four polishes inspired by my (second) favorite Ghibli film

Howl 001 - Radish Head (My favorite character. I can't deny it. He's adorable.)

Black glitter with pale grey, blue, and deep blue glitter accents


Howl 002 - Demon With A Heart (A polish inspired by everyone's favorite energy source, the demon Calcifer)

Red, orange, and gold glitter with gold and orange accents. It will look like flames!


Howl 003 - Beautiful Magician (The brilliant and beautiful Howl himself.)

Pink and grey glitter with light and deep blue accents


Howl 004 - Field of Flowers (Inspired by his favorite place to go.)

Bright blue and green glitter with pink, yellow, white, and orange accents


An important note: I have specific plans and recipes for each and every polish. They are all going to have different shapes and sizes of glitter in them - some large, some small, some tiny, some hexagonal, some square, some jagged - some even in special shapes, like stars, hearts, moons, or flowers! I hope you will all forgive me for not mentioning details, as I'd like to keep the individual recipe specifications secret until I have a chance to present them! ^^;; It's also for the sake of brevity, and as a sort of insurance plan, just in case!If you donate, and want to know details about the polish(es) you choose - you can e-mail me at otakupolish@yahoo.com and I will tell you everything you want to know! <3

<h1>My Story</h1>
<p>My name is Hallah, and I'm a fashion merchandiser born and raised in Los
 Angeles. I started working in the fashion industry at age 15, and over 
the last ten years, I've worked for some of the biggest names in the 
designer and retail industry, as well as every major buy/sell clothing 
store in the country. With ten years of knowledge and training under my belt, I am ready to pursue my dream of opening my own recycled vintage and designer clothing store. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The purpose of Ruby SoHo is simple: to provide shoppers with the ability to purchase expensive designer merchandise at the same prices they would pay at a Goodwill. With the economy in a negative state, shoppers have been scared away from expensive department stores and are finding new ways to get their fashion fix for less. For many people, the solution has been thrift shopping.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Now, imagine walking into a store to the sound of your favorite song pumping through an old school speaker system. You approach the closest rack, and find yourself sifting through a wall full of pants by companies such as Da Nang, Seven For All Mankind, Escada, Gucci, Derek Lam, Tsubi, Marc Jacobs, and Phillip Lim, along with some cute vintage Levis. When you reach for the price tag, you assume the store owner is either completely insane, or has no knowledge of what she is selling...$8?! That is unheard of. Imagine walking into a secondhand store and knowing you won't have to spend hours going through racks to find one or two items you like.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><img align=""none"" alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v675/LadyTrain/ruby2.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>With Ruby SoHo, I want to incorporate the flavor of the 1990's in a way that takes shoppers back to that moment: Pearl Jam blasting on the speakers, a True Romance poster on the fitting room wall. I want my customers to leave the store ecstatic to have just purchased two whole outfits for under $50, and grinning from ear to ear because they have just experienced a wonderful sense of nostalgia!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>My short term goal, which is why I have started this campaign, is to open a successful online store, with a one year goal of opening a storefront in the Los Angeles area. Any contribution that is made if and after the goal is reached will go towards the opening of the Ruby SoHo storefront and design.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><img align=""none"" alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v675/LadyTrain/Ruby1.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contribution to the store will <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">change my life</span>. Seriously. It has taken me many years to get to this level of buying ability, but with your help, I can finally pursue my ultimate life passion, and in the process, make many peoples lives a little bit more wonderful by providing them with the ability to own quality designer items at very little cost. In contributing, you are also helping to reduce the amount of waste and over-production of new textiles, and allowing otherwise forgotten goods to be recycled for potentially many more years.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>If I can find 100 people to donate $20, I can reach my goal and execute the crap out of this operation! What is $20, really?</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The cost of parking downtown for three hours.</p>
<p>A few Starbucks trips.</p>
<p>That one top you bought from that one store that ripped after you wore it that one time.</p>
<p>Dinner on a bad date.</p>
<p>The cover charge at a shitty nightclub.</p>
<p>One Yankee Candle. Just one.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>OR, $20 is a HUGE push towards helping this girl make her dream into a reality.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>

the last ten years, I've worked for some of the biggest names in the 
designer and retail industry, as well as every major buy/sell clothing 
store in the country. With ten years of knowledge and training under my belt, I am ready to pursue my dream of opening my own recycled vintage and designer clothing store. 

The purpose of Ruby SoHo is simple: to provide shoppers with the ability to purchase expensive designer merchandise at the same prices they would pay at a Goodwill. With the economy in a negative state, shoppers have been scared away from expensive department stores and are finding new ways to get their fashion fix for less. For many people, the solution has been thrift shopping.

Now, imagine walking into a store to the sound of your favorite song pumping through an old school speaker system. You approach the closest rack, and find yourself sifting through a wall full of pants by companies such as Da Nang, Seven For All Mankind, Escada, Gucci, Derek Lam, Tsubi, Marc Jacobs, and Phillip Lim, along with some cute vintage Levis. When you reach for the price tag, you assume the store owner is either completely insane, or has no knowledge of what she is selling...$8?! That is unheard of. Imagine walking into a secondhand store and knowing you won't have to spend hours going through racks to find one or two items you like.



With Ruby SoHo, I want to incorporate the flavor of the 1990's in a way that takes shoppers back to that moment: Pearl Jam blasting on the speakers, a True Romance poster on the fitting room wall. I want my customers to leave the store ecstatic to have just purchased two whole outfits for under $50, and grinning from ear to ear because they have just experienced a wonderful sense of nostalgia!

My short term goal, which is why I have started this campaign, is to open a successful online store, with a one year goal of opening a storefront in the Los Angeles area. Any contribution that is made if and after the goal is reached will go towards the opening of the Ruby SoHo storefront and design.




The Impact
Your contribution to the store will change my life. Seriously. It has taken me many years to get to this level of buying ability, but with your help, I can finally pursue my ultimate life passion, and in the process, make many peoples lives a little bit more wonderful by providing them with the ability to own quality designer items at very little cost. In contributing, you are also helping to reduce the amount of waste and over-production of new textiles, and allowing otherwise forgotten goods to be recycled for potentially many more years.

If I can find 100 people to donate $20, I can reach my goal and execute the crap out of this operation! What is $20, really?

The cost of parking downtown for three hours.
A few Starbucks trips.
That one top you bought from that one store that ripped after you wore it that one time.
Dinner on a bad date.
The cover charge at a shitty nightclub.
One Yankee Candle. Just one.

OR, $20 is a HUGE push towards helping this girl make her dream into a reality.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p><b>Busby Electronics</b> was started three years ago, although seeds for the idea were planted in the early 1980s when Donn Tarris owned, for a brief time, one of the rare Universal Audio 610 modular mixing consoles. These recording consoles, designed and built by Bill Putnam Sr were to become one of the most sought after mixers from the vacuum tube era. To recording engineers, these offered the bar to which other audio preamps were measured up to.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the console was in very poor shape, and a decision was made to trade the modules to a dealer in San Francisco who could place them into studios around the US as single channels of preamplification.</p>

<p><b>Fast forward to 2008</b>. After three years of modifying vintage audio preamps purchased off ebay <i>(see ArMod original 2005 design above)</i> and reselling them, Donn was finally ready to pursue the design of a new multi-channel audio mixer based on the best 1960s vacuum tube design. Largely driven by the desire to have a compact mixer that could feed the missing six channels of microphone preamplifiers in many eight channel digital audio interfaces, He spent a year studying vintage designs of preamps in books from the late 1950s and early 1960s. A business plan was formulated and investors approached to raise funds for completing the design of every component that would go into the mixer. A definite set of criteria was included in the plan:</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li>The design had to incorporate the best of ideas from the early 1960s along with the flexibility required in a modern recording studio. The gain structure had to be able to be set to mimic that of a late 1950s console, or set to allow for maximum headroom, low noise, and accurate amplification - all by the choice of the recording engineer.</li>
<li>The design was to be based on a selection of tubes that was not ubiquitous.<br/>
</li>
<li>The design should use as many locally available parts as possible - first within the local community, then from the province, then the country, then from other countries with similar economic circumstance. This was to ensure as many jobs as possible stayed in each of these geographic areas. Whenever possible, parts would be made locally within Busby's own shop. This currently includes all metal work, printed circuit boards, paint, and even the casting of the custom control knobs!<br/>
</li>
<li>The products must be able to be repaired in the field, to reduce shipping costs, as well as the amount of time needed to affect repairs. All design has this in mind to ensure that the equipment is easy to work on, and that parts are more readily available. No solid state or integrated circuits are used within the signal path. ICs are only used in the regulation of power and for the headphone amp. All other circuits are simple vacuum tube circuits using relatively commonly available parts.<br/>
</li>
<li>The products would not be sold just as hardware. In 1979 Donn was involved in starting the first school for recording arts aimed at project studio operators. He designed the initial courses for record engineering and production, giving students a solid base from which to carry on learning. The concepts covered in those initial courses is still relevant today, and will be made available to Busby customers through the web site.<br/>

<p><b>Who We Are:</b></p>
<p><b></b></p><p><b>IKURU </b>is an ethical fashion label based in Pemba, a bustling town on the Indian Ocean in Northern Mozambique (<a href=""http://www.ikuruproject.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.ikuruproject.com</a>)<span>. We are a small team with a big dream. IKURU
means ""strength"" in the local Macua language, and providing strength
to women through fashion is at the heart of the IKURU Project. In a converted
workshop, we train and employ Mozambican women from vulnerable social and
economic backgrounds to create original, handcrafted clothing for a living.
We use the beautiful locally-sourced vibrant capulanas (African wax print fabrics) that accompany women’s everyday lives
throughout Africa to make our trendy, everyday
clothes for women, men and children. </span></p>
<p>Through
fashion, IKURU helps single women with little formal work opportunities, low
access to health and childcare services to rebuild their lives. We provide professional
training and employment, subsidized childcare for their young ones, workshops
on gender, sexual education, family planning and financial management, and a
safe working environment where they can rebuild their confidence and, with
their salaries and increased skills, better contribute to their and their
families’ needs.</p>
<p></p><p>The
current team of seamstresses is comprised of seven young women who are learning
the trade from a talented tailor. July 2015 marked the one year anniversary of
the women joining IKURU. A celebration was in order to mark this special
achievement! The culmination of IKURU's hard work and beautiful clothing line
were displayed in a tour de force fashion event at one of Pemba's notable
venues. We hope this is just the beginning of our team –with time we would like
to see our business and the social impact of its investment grow to empower
even more women in Mozambique.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442846546/jkh9coradz6mzlfj9fig.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">**Models from the July 2015 Fashion Show in Pemba, MZ</span><br/></p>
<p><b>Why We Need YOUR Help:</b></p>
<p></p><p>For <b>IKURU</b> to
grow as a business and employ and empower more women in Pemba, developing
quality control and improving the management of the production line is critical.
Given Mozambique's lack of textile and apparel production, the local skills to
contribute to this capacity building are not available in Pemba. Therefore,<b> IKURU
is preparing to invite an expert design team (a designer and a professional
seamstress) to Pemba in November to build the capacity of the production team. </b>Through innovative workshops, the team will learn the design and production process from beginning to
end and simultaneously prepare the IKURU label for its next collection to be launched in
December 2015 at the Maputo Fashion Week (<a href=""http://www.mfw.co.mz"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.mfw.co.mz</a>). By the end of the training
visit, the team will have honed the skills needed to work on present and future collections, and will be
empowered to take more ownership over the quality of their output. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> </span></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442848405/wg8ctxbbnj1f4pwusfv1.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">**The current team of seamstresses in their workshop in Pemba, MZ</span><br/></p>

<p><b></b></p><p><b>IKURU</b> is honored to have the opportunity to
work with 2 design experts- Thais Marquez, a Brazilian designer, and Ana Elisa,
a professional seamstress and trainer who has worked alongside Marquez for years. Marquez is
a designer who currently works in São Paulo, Brazil, as a consultant in
strategic design. She has extensive experience working in innovative workshops
for the training of artisans in Brazil and as a value chain expert in crafts in Mozambique. The seasoned
seamstress will offer valuable hands-on training to the current IKURU team in
Pemba. The design team will create new designs

<p></p></div>","Who We Are:
IKURU is an ethical fashion label based in Pemba, a bustling town on the Indian Ocean in Northern Mozambique (www.ikuruproject.com). We are a small team with a big dream. IKURU
means ""strength"" in the local Macua language, and providing strength
to women through fashion is at the heart of the IKURU Project. In a converted
workshop, we train and employ Mozambican women from vulnerable social and
economic backgrounds to create original, handcrafted clothing for a living.
We use the beautiful locally-sourced vibrant capulanas (African wax print fabrics) that accompany women’s everyday lives
throughout Africa to make our trendy, everyday
clothes for women, men and children. 
Through
fashion, IKURU helps single women with little formal work opportunities, low
access to health and childcare services to rebuild their lives. We provide professional
training and employment, subsidized childcare for their young ones, workshops
on gender, sexual education, family planning and financial management, and a
safe working environment where they can rebuild their confidence and, with
their salaries and increased skills, better contribute to their and their
families’ needs.
The
current team of seamstresses is comprised of seven young women who are learning
the trade from a talented tailor. July 2015 marked the one year anniversary of
the women joining IKURU. A celebration was in order to mark this special
achievement! The culmination of IKURU's hard work and beautiful clothing line
were displayed in a tour de force fashion event at one of Pemba's notable
venues. We hope this is just the beginning of our team –with time we would like
to see our business and the social impact of its investment grow to empower
even more women in Mozambique.**Models from the July 2015 Fashion Show in Pemba, MZ
Why We Need YOUR Help:
For IKURU to
grow as a business and employ and empower more women in Pemba, developing
quality control and improving the management of the production line is critical.
Given Mozambique's lack of textile and apparel production, the local skills to
contribute to this capacity building are not available in Pemba. Therefore, IKURU
is preparing to invite an expert design team (a designer and a professional
seamstress) to Pemba in November to build the capacity of the production team. Through innovative workshops, the team will learn the design and production process from beginning to
end and simultaneously prepare the IKURU label for its next collection to be launched in
December 2015 at the Maputo Fashion Week (www.mfw.co.mz). By the end of the training
visit, the team will have honed the skills needed to work on present and future collections, and will be
empowered to take more ownership over the quality of their output.  **The current team of seamstresses in their workshop in Pemba, MZ
Who is the Expert
Design Team?
IKURU is honored to have the opportunity to
work with 2 design experts- Thais Marquez, a Brazilian designer, and Ana Elisa,
a professional seamstress and trainer who has worked alongside Marquez for years. Marquez is
a designer who currently works in São Paulo, Brazil, as a consultant in
strategic design. She has extensive experience working in innovative workshops
for the training of artisans in Brazil and as a value chain expert in crafts in Mozambique. The seasoned
seamstress will offer valuable hands-on training to the current IKURU team in
Pemba. The design team will create new designs
(patterns & sizes), train seamstresses on improved sewing skills and quality control, and ensure that each item that receives
an IKURU label upholds the highest level of quality possible for handmade
pieces.**A few of IKURU's designs from the most recent collection.
Budget & Perks:
IKURU needs $20,000 to bring the label to the
next level. The funds raised will allow the designer and seamstress team to
come to Pemba, cover costs for food and lodging, provide a subsidy for their
expertise and conduct intensive workshops with the local seamstresses, design a

<p>Chipwallet is a truly innovative wallet. It comes to you as a flat board with individual plates and an woven elastic band. It’s put together by you by simply releasing the plates from the board.</p>

Chipboard is a strong post-consumer recycled material typically used for shipping and packaging. Chipboard is durable, natural and sustainable. It looks great and feels great to the touch.</p>

<p>We picked 1.2mm thick, high-density boards (650-800kg/m3). Chipboard is a proven material most commonly used to protect fragile items.</p>

<p><strong>The Design and Manufacturing Process       </strong></p>
<p>Chipwallet is made from both dye-cut and laser cut parts. The texts on the plates are beautifully debossed. We first select the type of chipboards and density, from there the boards are cut into the final size and the individual plates are then die-cut and texts put in place.</p>
<p>Prototypes: We went through many iterations to find the perfect combination for the plate functions, various ways to hold the cards and items, and how to access them easily yet securely. We gave a few to some friends and they all love the look and feel of our lightweight wallet.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1495315198/ehrjqu8vtnoct7pm5jsu.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Prototypes</i></p>
<p>Early ideas include ""themed plates"" like Traveller's plate, Photogropher's plate, function specific plates that carry specific items like SD cards, SIM cards with paperclip and even coins cards. In the end, we decided to make the cash/miscellaneous card that can hold folded dollar bills and other flat items as it is the most versatile option.</p>

 ""...you’ll still get a fair amount of satisfaction from putting together your own Chipwallet just the way you like it. -GearHungry

Chipwallet is a truly innovative wallet. It comes to you as a flat board with individual plates and an woven elastic band. It’s put together by you by simply releasing the plates from the board.
Chipwallet is a unique and totally different concept because it uses a common material in an unexpected way. Chipboard is a strong post-consumer recycled material typically used for shipping and packaging. Chipboard is durable, natural and sustainable. It looks great and feels great to the touch.


There’s something about putting a project together yourself, it brings a sense of ownership different from getting something off the shelf. It somehow become uniquely yours.
Chipwallet is beyond a product purchase, from the moment you receive it, it invites you to a process of making and transforming, a simple bonding perhaps with something you will carry every day.
 

A beautiful & simple idea

Durable & feels great to the touch
Each Chipwallet board contains 4 plates and a woven band for you to create your perfect wallet: 2 cover plates, a cash/miscellaneous plate and a plate for two standard house keys.You decide which plates you need and pop them out from the board. Use only the two cover plates with credit card access, or with a cash plate to carry your dollar bills, or with keys plate, or all together in your wallet.

You can carry credit cards, cash and keys, or just carry credit cards and cash, the choice is yours.
 
Configure plates for quick access items
Chipwallet's modular plates lets you decide which items you use most often and thus need direct access to. If you need quick access to keys, put that plate on the outside. If the keys are back up set, put the keys plate in-between the credit cards.
Same with cash, you can choose to have the cash plate as a hidden storage between your cards, or directly easily accessible from one side of the wallet. With the recessed design, your cash will not add bulk to the wallet.The plate is 1.2mm thick and will fit up to 4 folded dollar bills flushed.

Configuration A: Cover plates on both sides
 

Configuration B: Keys plate on one side

Configuration C: Cash/misc. plate on one side

Cash plate fits coins, mini-cards & small flat items
 


Feature-packed in a Neat Package
 
Chipwallet is a minimalists' wallet at its core. So each element is carefully considered, designed and executed. The details are simple yet elegant and functional, and the material of the wallet complement that ""less is more"" philosophy. The texts on the plates are debossed and not printed.

Chipwallet will be made combining recycled materials, thoughtful design, and a stringent process that creates a beautiful, high quality product. The final product has natural feel and beautiful uniform finish.

Made with love & care
 

  Choose from 4 attractive color bands


Industrial grade high-density board (650-800kg/m3).
 
What is chipboard?
Chipboard is most commonly used in shipping boxes and packaging, made from recycled paper and wood waste. It is durable, strong and a beautiful material that feels great to the touch. It is also an incredibly honest material, our chipboard is natural and contains no dye and is 100% recyclable. Our elastic band is checkered woven from the highest quality cotton and polyester.
How strong is it?
We picked 1.2mm thick, high-density boards (650-800kg/m3). Chipboard is a proven material most commonly used to protect fragile items.
How durable is chipboard?
The chipboard we use is an industrial-grade chipboard. It is used in construction, car manufacturing and shipping. It's strong, lightweight and easy to work with.

Durable & Sustainable Material
 


Make it your own
Doodle on it, tell a story, gift it, go ahead. Draw a message and give it as a truly unique gift to your friends, family or loved ones. Tell a story or keep it blank, make it anyway you want it, make it about you.

 
The Design and Manufacturing Process       
Chipwallet is made from both dye-cut and laser cut parts. The texts on the plates are beautifully debossed. We first select the type of chipboards and density, from there the boards are cut into the final size and the individual plates are then die-cut and texts put in place.
Prototypes: We went through many iterations to find the perfect combination for the plate functions, various ways to hold the cards and items, and how to access them easily yet securely. We gave a few to some friends and they all love the look and feel of our lightweight wallet.

Prototypes
Early ideas include ""themed plates"" like Traveller's plate, Photogropher's plate, function specific plates that carry specific items like SD cards, SIM cards with paperclip and even coins cards. In the end, we decided to make the cash/miscellaneous card that can hold folded dollar bills and other flat items as it is the most versatile option.

<p>Have you ever been walking around outside and realized that you need to clean the lenses on your sunglasses? Individual microfiber cloths can be very hard to keep track of while you are on the go. </p>
<p>In the past, you would have to resort to using whatever cloth was available for cleaning, no matter how abrasive or ineffective. I asked myself: how can a pair of sunglasses be combined with the superior cleaning ability of microfiber material?</p>
<p>This question led to the creation of Ribbon Sunglasses.</p>
<h1>How Do They Work?</h1>
<p>Ribbon Sunglasses conceal a retractable microfiber cloth inside of the sunglass frame, allowing you to always have access to it no matter where you are. Microfiber is always the best solution for cleaning lenses, as it will never scratch or scuff the surface.</p>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/481/566/46d67483c07476f500aa2841be0177c1_large.jpg?1364707137"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<p>When you want to access the microfiber ribbon for cleaning, pull the recessed tab on the front of the frame. This tab allows you to extend the cloth. Run the cloth lightly over your lenses to clean away debris.</p>

<h1>How Do They Look?</h1>
<p>Short answer: they look GREAT.</p>
<p>The retractable ribbon has been built low profile into the corner of the frame. The functionality is so well integrated that it has been made invisible inside of the design. These sunglasses look very sharp.</p>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/600/109/55ff7220cf2220d7c25ce30701bf22f0_large.jpg?1368843500"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<p>The frame design was inspired by counter-culture imagery of the 1960s, mixed with sort of a new age appeal. Specifically, the frame recalls Ray-Ban's classic Wayfarer sunglasses, while at the same time having a slightly more modern, urban look. </p>

<h1>Materials and Construction</h1>
<p>Ribbon Sunglasses not only bring new functionality to the realm of eyewear, they are also made using the highest quality materials to help promote long-term durability. Here is an overview of what will go into a pair...</p>
<p><strong>Frame</strong></p>
<p>The sunglass frame is made from injection molded polycarbonate plastic. This material gives the sunglasses a sturdy feel while also allowing them to wrap around and conform to your face. Polycarbonate plastics are an industry standard and are proven to last through a great number of uses without difficulty.</p>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/627/601/2da54eab6fc65b31b27a39ec45c75597_large.jpg?1369791027"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<p><strong>Lenses</strong></p>
<p>The lenses begin with a polarized polycarbonate core, which is thermally fused to five additional layers. Two UV filtering layers block 100% of UVA and UVB ultraviolet rays up to 400 nanometers. The final outer layer consists of two scratch resistant films to help protect the lenses and keep them looking great.</p>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/627/603/63c07dfdfca295aca127671609195ee7_large.jpg?1369791044"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<p><strong>Microfiber Cloth</strong></p>
<p>The retractable microfiber cloth i'm using for the cleaning ribbon is the highest quality material available. The design required a very thin microfiber material, otherwise it wouldn't roll up tight enough to hide inside of the frame. It just so happened that the thinnest cloth was also the most effective at cleaning. A fiber weight of only .065 denier makes it almost twice as thin as other cleaning cloths on the market.</p>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/628/114/069d11e0d80e81e2204594b8e4c3906c_large.jpg?1369805886"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<h1>Production Plan</h1>
<p>Currently, I have several working prototypes of the frame design. Small changes need to be made to the microfiber insert piece, including a magnetic tip on the ribbon's axle to help it stay in place inside of the frame cavity. These changes will take place in the 3D modeling suite, perhaps taking a couple of weeks to finalize. </p>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-j6BreBQZtaI/UerwTVZiKKI/AAAAAAAAALw/EGK-dnhhtJM/w568-h69-no/development_tooling_manufacturing_final.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<p>Once the changes are made to the CAD files, i'll begin working with one of several injection molding manufacturers that i'm in talks with around the LA metro. This stage that will be where we create the finalized production sunglasses. Once I have the parts injection molded and polished, they will be shipped out as soon as possible!</p>
<h1>Perks</h1>
<p>When you back Ribbon at one of the levels where you receive an actual pair of sunglasses, you will be contacted after the project to confirm which color microfiber ribbon should be included with your sunglasses. </p>

<p>If you make a donation at any of the funding levels, i'll send you a digital version of Ribbon's development ""process book"". This book is going to be really cool, illustrated, and will take you through the entire process of what it has taken me to bring this product to market.</p>

The communication with the factory had been smooth and fast, which reduces the risks of manufacturing and delivery time substantially. Nevertheless we have set the delivery time in June  of 2016 to make sure that all backers will receive their bags on time as promised. This will give us more time to overcome any problems that might occur during manufacturing or delivery. <br/>To ensure that every bag is created to standard and delivered in time, we will be maintaining constant contact with the factory during the entire process of production. No matter what, we will update our backers during the production.</p><p></p><br/></div>","About this projectWhy Progo:

Whatever your destination, whatever you need to carry, whatever mode of transport you take, ProGo will meet your needs. Progo is compact and yet spaciousThe 35L backpack can easily accommodate a week's supply of clothes, a pair of shoes, a laptop and tablet, toiletry, personal accessories in their dedicated compartments as well as passports / valuables in the hidden pocket at the back. The main difference between Progo and other backpacks / carry ons, is that Progo has a built-in shelf which allows you to transfer your clothes from the bag to a closet in seconds.  Why is ProGo unique?Progo is no ordinary backpack. It's got 4 main features that NO other carrying bags have:  1- Integrated removable shelf Here is how you pack a Progo:1: Remove the shelf from the bag 2: Hang it in your closet and fill it with your clothes3: And put it back in the bagProGo is the only bag that  has a built in removable shelf. With this unique feature, you can transfer your belongings from Progo  to a closet in less than 10 seconds! Everything will be just as you packed them back home. Nice and crisp. 2- A separate shoe compartmentKeep your dirty shoes away from your clean clothes3- A safe hidden pouch at the back of the bagYou can keep your passport and valuable belongings in the hidden back pouch that will be impossible to reach when carrying the backpack, making sure that you will have a safe and smooth journey with your ProGo.

 ProGo is also made of durable waterproof tarp material that  will  keep all your belongings dry in all weather conditions.ProGo's name clearly says it. It's for people on the Go. Whether you are traveling around the block or the planet, ProGo will be your gear.ProGo is a bag large enough to carry all your needs and compact enough to be a carry onPROGO AND YOUWhy is ProGo right for you:Because you travel Because you createBecause you explorePrototyping:Why the 1st prototype failed?The first ProGo progotype had small separated external removable bag for toiletry and the shoe compartment was placed at the bottom of the bag. After using this prototype, I realized the 2 main issues.First the removable bag was not holding strong and kept on falling. Also it made the bag thicker, so I could not fit it easily in the plane carry on compartment. The second issue, with the shoe compartment at the bottom;  the bag could not stand straight. It was always leaning and falling because the top part when full was heavier than the bottom part. So I was forced to re design and recreate a second prototype which you see in this video and the pictures. By moving the shoe compartment to the top, and ditching the removable bag, and making an internal toiletry pouch instead; the prototype proved to be right and working perfectly. Here are pictures of the Final prototypes The  right side of the bag has a  bottle mesh pouch and  Tripod / Umbrella holder straps. The left side of the bag has a  small accessory / key pocket, an extra handle as well as a USB cable outlet. The back of the bag that has the hidden pocket. Sunglasses holder and ear bud mesh pouch on shoulder straps USB cable outlet Toiletry bag at the front of the backpack Mesh pouch for cellphones or ear budsLaptop / Tablet compartment with lots of business accessory / pen holdersWhat's Progo Made of?Progo will be built with heavy duty waterproof tarp nylon fabric (these are the materials that trucking companies use to protect goods from getting wet) , water proof sealed seamless  zippers with over size pullers and nylon strings, as well as padded frame/ walls and straps with durable and strong nylon webbing. Progo has been designed to last millions of miles.

Risks and challengesWe have already found a very reputable bag and luggage factory that has helped us making our prototypes. The communication with the factory had been smooth and fast, which reduces the risks of manufacturing and delivery time substantially. Nevertheless we have set the delivery time in June  of 2016 to make sure that all backers will receive their bags on time as promised. This will give us more time to overcome any problems that might occur during manufacturing or delivery. To ensure that every bag is created to standard and delivered in time, we will be maintaining constant contact with the factory during the entire process of production. No matter what, we will update our backers during the production.",39.0,1,"1 Campaign

I hated my breasts and my body.</p><p>I got tired of my bra straps digging into my shoulders. I hated my bra telling me what I could and could not wear. I was sad about not being able to go bra-less in low-cut, backless, strapless garments and bathing suits. And if you have experienced this, I know you're sick of it, too.

</ul></div>","We are a team of professional women who believe the words 'figure flaws' should be eliminated from our collective consciousness.  We know that all women, in all stations of life and in every corner of the world are valuable—no matter her size, shape, heritage or hue.  We are ethical in our business practices.  We know that success is measured by the people we help along the way, not the purses we carry or the shoes we wear, but we still like that stuff, too.  We want to accelerate the concept that women should be listened to, respected, and invested in.You can help us with our mission:INVEST in us.  Even if you can't personally use our product, you are telling everyone that women are worth supporting.BUY our product. When you pre-order our product, it gives us a sense of scale so we can properly order and not run out when you need our support most.SHARE our campaign. Please use your social media posts, good friends and great contacts to share our mission.  When you share our stuff, you help us change the world for women. While Bra-Less Bra was designed for women who are DD-N cups, our sizing goes all the way down to a B-cup. You’ll notice a shift in some of our branded materials as we have responded to those smaller-busted women who wanted more clarity in our packaging. Rest assured, we are the only product coming to market that can boast a size-span from B to N cup. And we are currently testing to see if we can go even larger. Woooo hoooo! Bra-Less Bra has smart, innovative technology that begs the question, Why didn’t I think of that?  Its invisible features provide 100% customization for women from B-N cups.  It provides superior lift, separation and support.  It’s specially engineered for larger-busted women by providing superior strength for more voluminous flesh, while being fully customizable to fit any breast size fighting gravity.  Looks can be deceiving.  Bra-Less Bra looks like just tape, but this is not just tape.Our ingenious design allows women to re-sculpt their cleavage line so they can have that smooth appearance of separation in the middle of their chest while suspending voluminous breast tissue on a near-invisible ‘shelf’. Once you get the knack of it, it takes between 15 to 30 seconds per breast to apply. The results… well, you can see them on our beautiful buxom goddesses and know, these can be your results, as well.Mariam Frei  @itsmariamfrei is an L.A. based blogger, lifestyles thought-leader and champion of women. When she learned about Bra-Less Bra she knew it was something special and important to women and so she immediately signed on as our newest goddess. Mariam is an E-cup and achieved a total of 5 inches of lift per breast with Bra-Less Bra. Whether your skin tone is the color of caramel candy, or alabaster or coal—if you are pretty paper bag brown, peach or olive—with Bra-Less Bra there is no need to figure it out.  We believe in one race—the human race.  And we believe in only one skin color and that’s sheer.We know that women want to look great in a variety of clothing and when you lift your boobs you lift your spirits.  With Bra-Less Bra you can look and feel beautiful inside and out.   Don't wait for a dress-up occasion.  Whether you're meeting friends for lunch, going on a first date, wearing a slightly risque blouse under your suit for an important meeting or dancing the night away on the town, wear Bra-Less Bra for extra support beneath your bra or dare to go bare with invisible support all the way to an N-cup.Except for the use of Bra-Less Bra, all models are bra-less in these photos.  Results may vary.I remember the first time someone made me feel badly about my body.  I was swinging on the monkey bars at my elementary school.  I was twelve years old.  A little boy poked me in the chest through my sweatshirt and teased me because I had breasts and the other little girls didn’t.  I was humiliated.It started my self-esteem roller coaster ride.I started taping my breasts in college.  Scotch tape.  Masking tape.  Duct tape.  Athletic tape.  Surgical tape.  I didn’t care that it was ripping the skin off my body, as long as I looked great in my clothing.  As long as I could wear what the other girls were wearing and fit in, I was fine with it.  That is, until during a routine physical when I was asked if I was in an abusive relationship.  My physician thought I was being battered because of all of the scars, bruises and scrapes around my breasts.At that moment, I came to the realization that I was abusing myself to look good in clothing.  At that very moment, I vowed that I never wanted another girl or teen or woman to feel like I did—a wild emotional and physical swing from covering and concealing to bruising and abusing for the sake of fitting into the fashion world.If you’ve ever felt like your bra dictates your fashion choices, I get it and I’m saying enough is enough.  I know your plight.For years the size of my bust-line was a constant source of shame and misery that plunged me into bouts of low body image. I hated my breasts and my body.I got tired of my bra straps digging into my shoulders. I hated my bra telling me what I could and could not wear. I was sad about not being able to go bra-less in low-cut, backless, strapless garments and bathing suits. And if you have experienced this, I know you're sick of it, too. That’s why I invented Bra-Less Bra.Bra-Less Bra is a specially designed bust-tape for girls with big girls. Bra-Less Bra is  sweat-proof and water resistant. It’s completely customizable and it works for women with big, beautiful, bodacious boobs. Wear it underneath an existing bra for an extra boost, or dare to go completely bra-less in most garments with superior and reliable lift, separation and support.Bra-Less Bra will not only raise your breasts but your self-esteem, too.Bra-Less Bra is powered-up by Zuke-iT, a company completely women-owned and operated seeking solutions to literally support women. We don’t believe in figure flaws, we believe in figure aspects and we know the time is now to fire your bra as your fashion consultant.Love yourself even more. Love your body even more.

We’re talking about two units of mass that need magical support at the speed of light.Our game-changing design pairs gravity-fighting strength with common-sense customization with engineering ingenuity to provide a tape that’s not just a tape.

<p><strong>As you may know, </strong>I’m an aspiring jeweler. I also recently dove into stained glass and plan to incorporate that medium into my budding business, Gemheart Jewelry + Glass. My dream is to be creating handmade jewelry + more out of my home studio as a full time gig!  </p>
<p><strong>My 2018 Resolution Word is “Dare”</strong>, so I’m challenging myself to pursue this dream through all possible avenues. My immediate priority is to build up my home studio and devote as much free time as possible at my bench.  By the end of the year, I want to reopen my Etsy store and set up shop at 3 art fairs in the DFW area. This means that I will need my studio completely revamped by August, which will give me enough time to get to work for all the fall fairs. </p>
<p><strong>Two years ago</strong> when I started making jewelry as a hobby, I had no idea I was working with so little! After training over a year now as a jewelers apprentice, I’m so much more knowledgeable and so much more CONFIDENT in my abilities. I’m not typically an impatient person so I like to think of this new found impatience as determination! I'm also not typically one to go out on a limb or put myself out there, so deciding to hold a fundraising campaign has been a pretty nerve wracking journey.  If there is one thing I knows, it's that it takes a lot of self discovery and overcoming insecurities to chase your dreams! So here we are.</p>
<p><strong>If you decide to contribute, </strong>there are a few perk options available, listed to the right! Since the studio is obviously under construction, physical rewards are not available at the present moment. However, the Etsy shop will be Reopened and Restocked in August, at which point your coupon codes will be made available for redemption! They are good through December, so you can even use them for Christmas gifts :)</p>
<p><strong>Please note - </strong> *Free shipping will especially pay off on stained glass items, as they are larger and need extra care due to their fragility*</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for reading and for all of your support, whether it is monetary support or not!</strong></p>
<p><i>The comprehensive list of all the things I need is as follows:</i></p>
<ul>
<li>Flex shaft + attachments </li>
<li>A large, reusable Oxygen tank (as opposed to several disposable ones) and the first fill up</li>
<li>Regulators for the gas and oxygen tanks </li>

<b>SuperSwitcher 2 :</b><p></p>
<p>The SuperSwitcher 2 is a programmable switching system for guitar, bass and any applications that require smart loop routing.</p>
<p>The unit includes the most advanced features built for a switcher inside a compact design enclosure,
allowing the player to have, for the first time ever, a smart programmable device
that can be placed in almost any
size pedalboard and include all the features players need:  <br/></p>
<ul>
<li>Audio loops<br/>
</li> <li>Relay switches (to control amp channels &amp; reverb)<br/>
</li> <li>Midi In &amp; Out to control presets and other midi applications</li>
<li>Switchable audio buffer</li>
<li> Basic Internal tuner (Tuner Out is also available)</li>
<li>The option to choose only the modules and features you need (custom)<br/>
</li> </ul>
<p>
</p>
<p>For the first time ever, we managed to build a smart modular design, allowing the players to order exactly what they want and have their own custom switcher without paying $2000 for it.</p>

<p>
</p>
<p>The modular design is built from 2 types of
modules - mandatory modules that come with any switcher,
and optional modules. The default setup of modules we choose includes all the features
that we feel are the best combination for most players - these are the specs for our standard SuperSwitcher 2:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>8 Audio loops for pedals (7 mono and 1 mono send/stereo return loop)<br/>
</li>
<li>
<p>2 relay switches -you can control amp channels, turn on the reverb in your amp and basically use anything that requires a latching switch with just one standard PL stereo
cable.</p>
</li>
<li>Midi in &amp; out - controls presets on your digital pedals and all other midi applications your setup has, Including an expression pedal jack!<br/>
</li>
<li>Switchable audio buffer at the input of the switcher - keep the spark of your guitar signal that you lose with long cables with this high quality buffer.</li>
<li>FX Loop module - allows you to break the connection between loops in order to have ""in from amp pedals"" and ""fx loop pedals"" setup, When ordering you will have the option to choose where to ""break"" the connection for you - after 4 loops or after 6 loops. For example - loops 1-6 will include wah , filter and distortion pedals, which will be sent to the amp Input. From the amp's FX loop of your amp you will send the signal back to the FX loop module of the switcher in order to have delay &amp; reverb pedals at loops 7-8.</li>
<li>Internal tuner - that's right! We have a basic guitar tuner built into the switcher! We also include a tuner out jack, if you want to use your own, more advanced tuner (signal is muted when using the tuner feature so no one in the crowd hears you tune).</li>
<li>Stereo outputs L&amp;R</li>
<li>99 Banks with 5 presets on each bank.<br/>
</li>
<li>GND lift switch (in custom switchable outputs only)<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/770800/files/20140806131351-ss4.jpg?1407356031"" src="""" style=""cursor: nw-resize;""/></p>

<p>If you choose the custom module order you will have some options to choose and change from our default setup:<br/></p> <ul>
<li>Remove the FX loop module in exchange for 2 additional relay switches<br/>
</li> <li>Remove the midi module in exchange for 2 additional relay switches (and keeping the FX loop module.<br/>
</li> <li>Exchange loops 7 and 8 for 2 stereo loops***</li>
<li>Exchange tuner out for A\B selectable inputs***</li>
<li>Exchange stereo outputs for A\B selectable outputs***</li>

The advanced MCU processor inside the switcher allows you to
have 99 banks with 5 presets in each bank. Each preset can include any combination of turning on
certain loops, switching amp channels and sending midi commands-all in one click!<br/><br/>
The switcher also has Manual Mode which allows
you to turn on a couple of pedals inside any
presets. For example, set switches 1-4 in bank A as
presets, and switch 5 as a manual
switch for loop 8 (let's say a
delay pedal). Now you can kick the delay pedal in and
out with switch 5 within any of the<span>  1-4 presets</span>!<br/><br/>
Another mode we have is the Silly Mode, which cancels all presets and makes the switcher act as a standard true bypass
looper (switch 1 will turn loop 1 on, etc.).<br/><br/>The MCU also allows wireless
features, USB connectivity, iPhone control
via Bluetooth and many more advanced features***<br/>

<p><b>What is the difference between the first 45 units for $279 batch to the regular $299 units?</b></p>
<p>The first 45 units are the first prototypes units that we already purchased their enclosures so they will look exactly like in the video - this is why they will ship sooner, the regular batch ($299 + shipping units) will be the first version units, they will look the same and have the same size but may feature different text or words on the layout depend on the later changes that we will make on the software. both options will come with full warranty.<b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>When the perks will be shipped?</b></p>
<p>All small perks related to merchandise only will be shipped about 3-4 weeks after the indiegogo project time is done, banners however will be uploaded a few days after time is done, all other perks have an estimated time detailed at the perks section on the right.<b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>What
type of power supply do I need for the switcher?</b></p>
<p>A standard
9V DC 500mA negative center power supply is required, the actual power consumption
is depend on how many loops are turned on the same time – for a normal use of
about 4-5 loops per preset, the switcher will use about only 200mA. </p>
<p><b>Do I
need to add more money for shipping?</b></p>
<p>All
perks include free shipping or include the shipping costs so no additional
money is needed. </p>
<p><b>Can
I control presets with CC and PC midi commands on my Strymon\line 6\other
digital effects?</b></p>
<p>Yes,
the switcher can send midi commands up to 5 devices on the same time (or more
in OMNI mode), include CC and PC commands so you can control %100 of midi
features.</p>
<p><b>Can
I set a preset to turn on couple of pedals, switch amp channel and also send
midi on the same preset?</b></p>
<p>Yes,
the switcher (with the default module combination) can turn on up to 8 pedals,
use 2 relay switchers and also send midi at the same time all in one click!</p>
<p><b>What
risk do I have when ordering the switcher?</b></p>
<p>There
is no risks at all! The switcher is %90 ready, we just need the funding for
ordering the minimum quantities of parts in order to sell it cheap in the future,
by funding us know we will allow you to get the switcher in such a low price compared
to the future retail price.</p>
<p><b>If you will reach above $25K, how can i choose the larger switcher?</b></p>
<p>After the indiegogo time is up, we will contact each one and offer an upgrade to the larger version with small additional fee that will be applied.<br/></p>
<p><b>If you will reach above $50k, will the switcher be delayed?</b><br/></p>

There is a good chance the switcher will be delayed as we will need to upgrade the software and hardware, rest in sure that it will be worth it! :)<br/><br/><p><b>What are the warranty terms?</b>
<br/></p>
<p> 1 year of full warranty on all parts and repairs in our lab, shipping expenses are on the costumer, Full warranty terms are listed on our official website.<br/></p>

SuperSwitcher 2 :
The SuperSwitcher 2 is a programmable switching system for guitar, bass and any applications that require smart loop routing.
The unit includes the most advanced features built for a switcher inside a compact design enclosure,
allowing the player to have, for the first time ever, a smart programmable device
that can be placed in almost any
size pedalboard and include all the features players need:  

Audio loops
 Relay switches (to control amp channels & reverb)
 Midi In & Out to control presets and other midi applications
Switchable audio buffer
 Basic Internal tuner (Tuner Out is also available)
The option to choose only the modules and features you need (custom)
 


For the first time ever, we managed to build a smart modular design, allowing the players to order exactly what they want and have their own custom switcher without paying $2000 for it.



  



The modular design is built from 2 types of
modules - mandatory modules that come with any switcher,
and optional modules. The default setup of modules we choose includes all the features
that we feel are the best combination for most players - these are the specs for our standard SuperSwitcher 2:


8 Audio loops for pedals (7 mono and 1 mono send/stereo return loop)


2 relay switches -you can control amp channels, turn on the reverb in your amp and basically use anything that requires a latching switch with just one standard PL stereo
cable.

Midi in & out - controls presets on your digital pedals and all other midi applications your setup has, Including an expression pedal jack!

Switchable audio buffer at the input of the switcher - keep the spark of your guitar signal that you lose with long cables with this high quality buffer.
FX Loop module - allows you to break the connection between loops in order to have ""in from amp pedals"" and ""fx loop pedals"" setup, When ordering you will have the option to choose where to ""break"" the connection for you - after 4 loops or after 6 loops. For example - loops 1-6 will include wah , filter and distortion pedals, which will be sent to the amp Input. From the amp's FX loop of your amp you will send the signal back to the FX loop module of the switcher in order to have delay & reverb pedals at loops 7-8.
Internal tuner - that's right! We have a basic guitar tuner built into the switcher! We also include a tuner out jack, if you want to use your own, more advanced tuner (signal is muted when using the tuner feature so no one in the crowd hears you tune).
Stereo outputs L&R
99 Banks with 5 presets on each bank.

GND lift switch (in custom switchable outputs only)





  


If you choose the custom module order you will have some options to choose and change from our default setup: 
Remove the FX loop module in exchange for 2 additional relay switches
 Remove the midi module in exchange for 2 additional relay switches (and keeping the FX loop module.
 Exchange loops 7 and 8 for 2 stereo loops***
Exchange tuner out for A\B selectable inputs***
Exchange stereo outputs for A\B selectable outputs***

** see more info below 

*** those features will be available only if we reach a specific amount of funding - see IF WE REACH section

  

The advanced MCU processor inside the switcher allows you to
have 99 banks with 5 presets in each bank. Each preset can include any combination of turning on
certain loops, switching amp channels and sending midi commands-all in one click!
The switcher also has Manual Mode which allows
you to turn on a couple of pedals inside any
presets. For example, set switches 1-4 in bank A as
presets, and switch 5 as a manual
switch for loop 8 (let's say a
delay pedal). Now you can kick the delay pedal in and
out with switch 5 within any of the  1-4 presets!
Another mode we have is the Silly Mode, which cancels all presets and makes the switcher act as a standard true bypass
looper (switch 1 will turn loop 1 on, etc.).The MCU also allows wireless
features, USB connectivity, iPhone control
via Bluetooth and many more advanced features***
*** These features will be available
only if we reach a specific amount of funding - see IF WE REACH section.
  

The SuperSwitcher 2
is built from the best parts and components we can find, including
high quality, military-grade aluminum chassis and parts from Alpha
switches, Neutrik jacks, Bourns, Omron Relays, Davies USA made knobs, Microchip
MCUs and more! We as a company believe in making the best quality products without saving money on parts!

<h3><span><b>What’s the story behind the Pearl Revolver?</b></span></h3>
<p></p>
<span>ILADORA adopted the Pearl Revolver as a symbol for the brand due to an inspirational woman in history. In 1894 Annie Londenderry became the very first woman to bike around the world, carrying only a change of clothing and her pearl revolver. She finished her journey in 1895 and was documented as being a true athlete, entrepreneur, mother and traveler. Her journey was extraordinary and unprecedented for a woman, especially at that time. Annie’s story is one that we connected with as an expression of our motivation to never stop challenging ourselves. </span><p><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><br/></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<h3><b>Who is ILADORA?</b></h3>
<p>For us, this project is a personal one.  We knew there was a void in women’s apparel and believe we can fill it. ILADORA Apparel is representative of who we are and the clothing we want to wear. We sourced the highest quality of eco-friendly and durable fabric for this pant and are working with a local manufacturer in San Francisco to have it produced.</p>

<font color=""#222222""><p>We’ve invested over $5,000 of our personal funds up to this point for product development and testing. Next steps are to purchase materials and get the product to manufacturing.</p>

<h3><b>Shipping/Delivery Schedule</b></h3>
<p>Our first run is limited due to our initial order of fabric. We wanted to make sure we had the materials in hand to manufacture.

<h3><b>Risks and challenges</b></h3>

<p><b>History</b></p>
<p>I am a professional woman who participates in many different activities<br/>during the<br/><br/>day, these include family, social or business activities, and I love to look<br/>stylish for each of these, but it is also important to have accessories that<br/>are both practical and versatile.</p>
<p>On a trip I made to New York, I asked myself, why the world has lost the<br/>true concept of luxury and after being invited to several seminars about this<br/>subject, I decided to create a Chilean luxury brand where I have included<br/>traditional factors that most brands considered luxurious have ceased to<br/>include.</p>
<p>These factors are:</p>
<p>The use of natural and refined materials; </p>
<p>Classic designs that have endure;</p>
<p>Products that are intensive in specialized craftmanship and Production with an intensive sense of social and environmental responsibility </p>
<p>This is how the creation of the brand “Maria Gallo” began, which in its first<br/>stage was only sold in New York using exotic leathers like ostrich.</p>
<p>Later on, we would open up to the production of all fine leathers of<br/>every kind, leaving the ostrich line only for very exclusive articles, in which<br/>the models may be the same, but no two products are ever alike.</p>
<p>In order to confirm the acceptance to these products, I participated in<br/>the Global Summit of Women 2013 which took place in Malasia, where 1,100 women<br/>from 72 countries participated. I was the only Chilean who participated in the<br/>encounter.</p>
<p>Another great motivation for the creation of this brand is that we<br/>always refer to<br/><br/>recycling raw materials, but no one ever mentions recycling labor, which in<br/>this case is the rescue of artisans work that is highly qualified and trained<br/>by the international company, Gucci, which for a long period of time, had a<br/>large portion of their production in Chile. However, due to a policy of cost<br/>reduction and following the world trend, many companies moved their production<br/>to other countries, especially those in Asia, leaving all that valuable and<br/>meticulous labor without a work source. The brand “Maria Gallo” has meant for these<br/>artisans a new opportunity and a valuation of their skills.</p>
<p><b>We need :</b></p>
<p>I am requesting funding for purchasing the machinery necessary for optimization of the leather cutting process. <br/><br/>     The objective is to liberate the craftsmen’s time in the cutting process,<br/>     therefore allowing them to apply their knowledge to the other areas of<br/>     production of each specialized piece and optimizing the use of their<br/>     production time. </p>
<p><b>You are collaborating in three different ways:</b></p>
<p>1<sup>st</sup>. Helping people that are valuable skilled to get back their jobs, maintaining the craftsmanship legacy.</p>
<p>2<sup>nd</sup> Helping the environment by supporting a natural material production.</p>
<p>3<sup>rd</sup> You are making a long term investment in your image,because the beauty of each creation have meant that each article that carries the brand “Maria Gallo” has been denominated by experts to be a “Piece of jewelry made in leather”.<br/>Therefore, the concept of luxury does not end at the purchase, but continues<br/>with the privilege of using it.</p>

<p>HISTORIA</p>
<p>En un viaje a Nueva York, me pregunté del porqué ya casi no se fabricaban en Chile artículos de buena calidad y que este era solamente un privilegio de unas cuantas marcas de lujo. Para rescatar esta capacidad de producción local de artículos de cuero de primera calidad, nace la marca  ""María Gallo"", la que tiene como fundamento 4 factores  que deben tener toda marca y producto para que pueda ser considerado de lujo.</p>
<p>Estos factores son:</p>
<ol>
<li>Uso materiales naturales y finos,</li>
<li>Diseños clasicos que permanezcan en el tiempo,</li>
<li>Producción con alto contenido de mano de obra especializada, y</li>
<li>Alta responsabilidad social y empresarial, en todo su proceso de fabricación y comercialización.</li>
</ol>
<p>Por otra parte, pude notar que en el mercado que hay pocas carteras que se puedan usar para varias ocasiones y que siempre luzcan bien, vale decir, poder ir con ellas a una cena, al supermercado, o en diferentes circunstancias, y que aun así, siempre sea un accesorio que aporte estilo y elegancia a una tenida.</p>
<p>Otro aspecto que pude observar es que siempre se menciona el hecho y necesidad de reciclar materiales, pero poco o casi nada se dice del concepto de reciclar mano de obra y de darle así una segunda oportunidad a personas que tienen un alto grado de especialización y tradición cultural, y que, por politicas de producción de bajo costo, no nos damos cuenta que se pierden en el tiempo y luego no podremos ya rescatar.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Lo que pido  en esta campaña.</h3>
<p>Los recursos que solicito en esta campaña, son para comprar una maquina de corte de cuero, que optimiza el tiempo de producción de los artesanos.</p>
<h3>En resumen.</h3>
<p>Al aportar en esta campaña, que puede ser eligiendo uno de los productos desde USD $10, o bien sólo aportando, usted obtiene 3 beneficios diferentes:</p>
<ul>
<li>1°. Ayuda a mantener y recuperar a artesanos valiosos y especializados, rescatando y conservando un legado cultural importante.</li>
<li>2°  Ayuda al medio ambiente al financiar una actividad que prácticamente no contamina y que solamente utiliza materiales naturales.</li>
<li>3°  Ayuda a potenciar su imagen con un producto fino y exclusivo, que le aporta elegancia, protege sus recursos al tener un producto que dura 5 veces más en el tiempo, por calidad y diseño y, sobre todo, porque la belleza de cada creación le ha valido a la marca ""Maria Gallo"" ser considerada por los expertos como: ""Una joya hecha en cuero"". Por estos motivos la alegría de poder adquirirlo no termina en en el proceso de adquisición, sino en el privilegio de usarlo y lucirlo.</li>

<p>One of these opportunities is another invite, again as the only Canadian, to show my collection during <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/TobagoFashionWeekend"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Tobago Fashion Week</a>, May 17-19th, 2013.  As a brand new company, I'm still doing everything that needs to get done all by myself, from cutting and sewing to fielding press calls and advertising.  So why do another runway show?  In fashion, exposure is opportunity.  This opportunity would be really great for my brand, since I've already had a lot of interest from the Caribbean and South America and it would further open my label up to a new market.  But it is an endeavor that is difficult to manage and financially support long-term by myself.  </p>

<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>This isn't just a free vacation for me...I wish!  It's a chance to assist my label in getting to an international platform.  A lot of hard work and planning goes into a 10 minute show!  By reaching my funding goal, I will be able to recoup some of the costs involved in participating in a runway show.  </p>
<p>To show at Tobago Fashion Week, the participation fee is astonishingly low (and is one of the reasons I chose to participate).  It came out to about $250 CAD, plus shipping a piece to the TFW panel, which was another $150.  There is also a retail element to the runway show, so I will be producing a few more samples, besides the runway samples, for sale.  More samples equals more fabric costs upfront.  Labour costs aside, I'll probably need around $500 to cover material costs.  Hopefully I'll recoup some of these costs by selling some pieces.  There will also probably be fees for runway photos after the show is over.</p>
<p>For the trip itself, I will be taking an assistant, since my collection is a full collection and I will need help backstage and at the retail booth from someone who knows my work.  The flight will be around $250 each way, per person = $1000.  Hotels there seem to run about $100/night.  For four or five nights = $500.</p>
<p>I know my totals are more than my funding goal, but I'm really just asking for help. I'll do the rest!  If I don't reach my goal, I'll still be going, it'll just be harder to continue funding myself.</p>

</h3><p><br/></p><p>The story of perfect wallet began in april 2012. I was on the party with friends we were having fun and the morning after I found out that i lost my wallet or someone stole it from me. I always wore it in back of my jeans like 90% population but after this experiance i want wallet that fit into my front pocket or into small packet of shirt. So i looked for this specific wallet and the only wallets i found that fits my needs were from 199$ to 299$ and that is too expensive for something you will use 2-4 years. So in May me and my friends put together ideas for wallet that fits everyone, with packets and sizes you want that means no unnecessary pockets that will create ""fat"" wallet and in july was born<b> first prototype</b>.</p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1278264/files/20150308110715-first_prototype1.jpg?1425838035"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>So now we had wallet and we needed material that will suit us for our wallet. Leather was too expensive and its not perfect material. After month of looking i found Tyvek. That was the best material for this. Easy to work with,waterproof,eco-friendly and the most beautiful things is that it's durable. <b>So in November we created almost 30 prototypes for our families and friends. I</b><b>n video we use these prototypes and they are 2 and a half years old :)</b></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1278265/files/20150308110734-second_prototypeasd.jpg?1425838054"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Difrent sizes and difrent structure of pockets. In 2013 it was year of testing how durable and good these wallets are. The fedback was amazing even from people that has the wallet olny for 1-2 month. We were quite happy but we knew we had to improve s me things like <b>add more components</b> to choose from, <b>stronger back</b>, <b>RFID</b>, building proces. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1283551/files/20150310070837-comp_choise.jpg?1425996517"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>By the end of a year we had everything ready to build a final form of wallet that we wanted. In march 2014 we created wallet that looks and feel like something special and incredible together.

</div></div>","The story of perfect wallet began in april 2012. I was on the party with friends we were having fun and the morning after I found out that i lost my wallet or someone stole it from me. I always wore it in back of my jeans like 90% population but after this experiance i want wallet that fit into my front pocket or into small packet of shirt. So i looked for this specific wallet and the only wallets i found that fits my needs were from 199$ to 299$ and that is too expensive for something you will use 2-4 years. So in May me and my friends put together ideas for wallet that fits everyone, with packets and sizes you want that means no unnecessary pockets that will create ""fat"" wallet and in july was born first prototype.So now we had wallet and we needed material that will suit us for our wallet. Leather was too expensive and its not perfect material. After month of looking i found Tyvek. That was the best material for this. Easy to work with,waterproof,eco-friendly and the most beautiful things is that it's durable. So in November we created almost 30 prototypes for our families and friends. In video we use these prototypes and they are 2 and a half years old :)Difrent sizes and difrent structure of pockets. In 2013 it was year of testing how durable and good these wallets are. The fedback was amazing even from people that has the wallet olny for 1-2 month. We were quite happy but we knew we had to improve s me things like add more components to choose from, stronger back, RFID, building proces. By the end of a year we had everything ready to build a final form of wallet that we wanted. In march 2014 we created wallet that looks and feel like something special and incredible together. After a half year testing this wallet we knew that this was the thing we wanted to create. Perfect in every aspect. And this is the born of Your Wallet.

How thin is it?


The thickness is between 0.5 - 1 cm/0.2 - 0.4 inches(Large) with full capacity of cards,receipts and casht. But it depends on the type of wallet too .

Do i get components or complete wallet?


You will get a complete wallet, it means that we will build it for you of the components that you selected.

I have different currency, will my fit?



We designed the wallets with after we measured all major international notes. The wallet fits USD, GPB, EUR, YEN, and more!



Note: The EURO Note ranges in size. The higher the value of the note the bigger the dimensions of the note. The high value notes are bigger than most currencies and don't fit in most wallets, You also find them less.

The most commonly used EURO notes of 5,10,20,50,100 EUR all fit in the wallet. 

Will my wallet last?

Yes. Tyvek material is paper thin but extremely durable, tear resistant and 100% water resistant. This wallet will last you years!
how do i choose my wallet?
When the campaign is over we will send you an email with all the wallets and components to choose from  - You choose.  We ship.
Are they waterproof? Really waterproof?

Since Tyvek is technically a sheet plastic, it's completely waterproof. It's HDPE like milk jugs so if it gets wet, you can just shake the water right off of it.
Can i order more then 1 wallet?


Yes one way is to donate again or after campaign is over and you will get email from us to choose your wallet, choose second one and email us back with both of them and we will talk about it with you :)

I have lived in Canada, Singapore, and Switzerland. I have four young children and I am a very proud stay-at-home mother. I am the CEO of Clasp Magic, a tool that revolutionizes clasp bracelet attachment! My utility patent is so strong that no one will EVER be able to file a patent with the USPTO securing the clasp end of jewelry in an open position! I have two further ideas down the road: a compact, streamline mini-version for bracelet removal and an adapted version to help with necklaces. I will have three products in my line someday! I have a story. It is real. It is raw. It is powerful. <b>I think of Clasp Magic as a blazing trail behind me and all of my backers are helping lay down the fuel it needs to be ENORMOUS! </b></p><p> I am one of four children. I fought my way into a very select program at Queen’s University in Canada. The program was called ConEd and it guaranteed two degrees in five years. I have a B.A.H. in Psychology and a B.E.d for primary and junior students. It was a breakup in my final university year that sparked the desire to teach internationally. I was initially rejected by my desired school for being too young and inexperienced. However, I continued to follow-up with them and was finally offered a junior kindergarten teaching position at the Canadian International School (CIS) in Singapore. On the day I left, I took seven pieces of luggage and flew around the world to a country I knew nothing about to start my first year as a teacher. I vividly remember sitting in my new classroom, full of boxes and crying, “What am I supposed to do now?” I got up and I just did It. I am a tough woman and will push and challenge myself on my own. One of my new students came in early to meet me…I had chosen to become a teacher back in the day as opposed to a pediatric nurse because I did not want to work with sick children. I did not think I would be strong enough. So, one week into living in Singapore, I met a 4-year-old American expat in my class who was in remission for leukemia. I was mad! Why did I have to have this sweet girl with this condition in my very first class? Long story short, my student relapsed…she went back to a specialized hospital in the United States after her first year with me. Her cancer came back for the third time. I was starting my second year in Singapore at the time and was given special permission to fly to Florida, where she was spending the last few weeks of her life. I played, walked, and talked to this sweet girl, who loved me, her teacher, Miss Vipond. On the day I had to leave, she had fallen into a sleep from which she never awoke. Two days later, she passed away. To say that this affected my young 22-year-old heart is putting it lightly!!! I had a dream a few weeks later where she told me not to look up when I was talking to her because she was sitting right beside me! This happened in October 2003 and it shaped my life forever! She is still with me in spirit today. I vowed that day to never give up, never take anything for granted, and to live a life to the fullest without any regrets. I had personally witnessed a family loss, one of the hardest things in the world! I saw how deeply it affected that family and how they would have given anything to have had more time with her. This experience made me grow up really fast and showed my young self the most important things in life. I wanted to leave Singapore at the end of my second year but I was not ready to come back to Canada. I decided I would go to a job fair and try to get a position at another international school in Switzerland. Again, the first reaction was, not enough experience. I committed to following-up and was finally offered another kindergarten position. </p><p>After moving to Zurich, I had to attend a work function. <b>This is when I first struggled with the two clasp bracelets from Tiffany &amp; Co.! I knew at that moment how I would later solve this problem!</b> I met my husband, Nick at a tram stop downtown Zurich at the end of my first year in Switzerland. We met in May 2005. Fast forward to August 2007, we got engaged in the Limmat River, which runs through the town of Zurich, and we were married in the Fraumunster on June 25th, 2008. I ran my one and only marathon the following spring. It was the London marathon in April 2009. This was always something that I had wanted to do, so I bought myself a training watch, a book, and I trained myself. Nick would drop me off and pick me up from my long training runs. I got into the London Marathon 2009 (you have to apply) and I ran for the charity, Children with Leukemia. I raised over 2,000 GBP and ran on my own in 4:48:00:00, just under five hours. </p><div data-id=""20865553""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1528919205/re46hlobgt6xtjefheik.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div><p> My first child was born on March 18th, 2010. We decided to move back to Canada and bought a house in March 2011. My second child was born on March 14th, 2012 and my third child just 15 months later on June 23, 2013. I had stopped my teaching job a few months before my first child was born and was still an at home mom in June 2014. I found out that I was expecting, my fourth baby on the day of my 7th wedding anniversary, June 25th, 2014. This was only two days after my third child turned one. Around that time, the “panic” of having and raising four children under the age of five set in. My sister had loosely mentioned that there are companies that help to design inventions. So, it was during a nap time in June that I looked into a few companies in Toronto, Canada. I wrote down a few numbers and starting dialing. The first number I called put me through to an automated recording and I decided against leaving a message. Then, I picked up MAKO’s number and called. A REAL, LIVE PERSON picked up the phone and spoke to me right away! I had a really good feeling about this company and during that very first phone call, I was put through to the vice president. I was VERY hesitant to give away too many details about my idea at that time, but he agreed to meet with me for my free consultation. I cannot remember the exact date, but it was mid-August 2014 and I was about 12 weeks pregnant with my fourth child. My dad drove me into Toronto while my mother stayed at home with my three napping children. I pitched my idea to the vice president of MAKO and he liked it. </p><p>What I have found amazing, as many women have done before me, is how I have never given up. I made time at all costs to get to Toronto (for product development with MAKO) even with a newborn baby, two other toddlers napping at home, and one in her first year of kindergarten. <b>I have never stopped for a second believing in Clasp Magic.</b> Gaps in my timeline were due to waiting for patent protection and monetary funds. I do not have an MBA. I did not get a grant to financially start on this path. I have a loan from my parents and we have a line of credit…I am ALL in! For years, other mothers would ask me, “Oh, do you work?” And before my patent went through in July 2017, I would answer, ”No, I am at home with my children”. The school year of September 2013 through September 2015, I had three young children at home. But I have been working. I was working on something the whole time! I do not have many friends who stayed at home after their third child was born. I don’t personally know many moms of four. My stay-at-home days were hard! I went one year wearing the same seven outfits and I was just happy to be in clean clothes. I had to fully remove myself from social media for this year. It was so upsetting for me to see my close friends on holidays, date nights, lunches with friends, etc. I had little to no freedom in those years. I am not complaining because I have healthy children and the sacrifice was and will always be worth it, but, it was hard living through it at the time. The social media age has changed everything for mothers too. I was so isolated! This was my low self-esteem period. I cannot remember exactly how, but slowly I started to pick myself up. My kids were always perfectly taken care of, they looked amazing, but there was only so much effort I could afford for myself. I looked tired and worse for wear. I still have such little time to get ready in the morning. <b>When I had Clasp Magic’s prototype in my possession, I used it ALL THE TIME!!! Only seconds to accessorize, Clasp Magic got my old Tiffany &amp; Co. bracelets out of the drawer and on my wrists. It is truly amazing how putting on a few accessories transforms your persona.</b> I felt more on top of everything in my life and was more confident when I did. I added makeup back into my routine - which helped too. Mothers noticed and would say, “I don’t know how you do it!” This gave me such pride! This gear shift helped me to work harder than ever. I always work during nap times and evenings. My youngest child is not enrolled in any preschool this year. She has one morning at my parents’ house so I can work on Clasp Magic and I have her with me for the rest of the week. I have still been able to drive progress this year with Clasp Magic. My little student whom I witness lose her battle with cancer 15 years ago is still with me. My life and experience have driven this project from its conception. The idea of not trying, of not bringing Clasp Magic to life, was never a risk I was willing to take. <b>I want to help motivate other women and mothers everywhere with my story!</b> I want to be able to give back to communities of mothers in less fortunate countries. I will always help anyone who asks! This is what life and the world are about.</p><div data-id=""21120192""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1528919208/be00srtbdr7gsb7ilfuc.png"" src=""""/></figure></div></div>","Play

I have lived in Canada, Singapore, and Switzerland. I have four young children and I am a very proud stay-at-home mother. I am the CEO of Clasp Magic, a tool that revolutionizes clasp bracelet attachment! My utility patent is so strong that no one will EVER be able to file a patent with the USPTO securing the clasp end of jewelry in an open position! I have two further ideas down the road: a compact, streamline mini-version for bracelet removal and an adapted version to help with necklaces. I will have three products in my line someday! I have a story. It is real. It is raw. It is powerful. I think of Clasp Magic as a blazing trail behind me and all of my backers are helping lay down the fuel it needs to be ENORMOUS!  I am one of four children. I fought my way into a very select program at Queen’s University in Canada. The program was called ConEd and it guaranteed two degrees in five years. I have a B.A.H. in Psychology and a B.E.d for primary and junior students. It was a breakup in my final university year that sparked the desire to teach internationally. I was initially rejected by my desired school for being too young and inexperienced. However, I continued to follow-up with them and was finally offered a junior kindergarten teaching position at the Canadian International School (CIS) in Singapore. On the day I left, I took seven pieces of luggage and flew around the world to a country I knew nothing about to start my first year as a teacher. I vividly remember sitting in my new classroom, full of boxes and crying, “What am I supposed to do now?” I got up and I just did It. I am a tough woman and will push and challenge myself on my own. One of my new students came in early to meet me…I had chosen to become a teacher back in the day as opposed to a pediatric nurse because I did not want to work with sick children. I did not think I would be strong enough. So, one week into living in Singapore, I met a 4-year-old American expat in my class who was in remission for leukemia. I was mad! Why did I have to have this sweet girl with this condition in my very first class? Long story short, my student relapsed…she went back to a specialized hospital in the United States after her first year with me. Her cancer came back for the third time. I was starting my second year in Singapore at the time and was given special permission to fly to Florida, where she was spending the last few weeks of her life. I played, walked, and talked to this sweet girl, who loved me, her teacher, Miss Vipond. On the day I had to leave, she had fallen into a sleep from which she never awoke. Two days later, she passed away. To say that this affected my young 22-year-old heart is putting it lightly!!! I had a dream a few weeks later where she told me not to look up when I was talking to her because she was sitting right beside me! This happened in October 2003 and it shaped my life forever! She is still with me in spirit today. I vowed that day to never give up, never take anything for granted, and to live a life to the fullest without any regrets. I had personally witnessed a family loss, one of the hardest things in the world! I saw how deeply it affected that family and how they would have given anything to have had more time with her. This experience made me grow up really fast and showed my young self the most important things in life. I wanted to leave Singapore at the end of my second year but I was not ready to come back to Canada. I decided I would go to a job fair and try to get a position at another international school in Switzerland. Again, the first reaction was, not enough experience. I committed to following-up and was finally offered another kindergarten position. After moving to Zurich, I had to attend a work function. This is when I first struggled with the two clasp bracelets from Tiffany & Co.! I knew at that moment how I would later solve this problem! I met my husband, Nick at a tram stop downtown Zurich at the end of my first year in Switzerland. We met in May 2005. Fast forward to August 2007, we got engaged in the Limmat River, which runs through the town of Zurich, and we were married in the Fraumunster on June 25th, 2008. I ran my one and only marathon the following spring. It was the London marathon in April 2009. This was always something that I had wanted to do, so I bought myself a training watch, a book, and I trained myself. Nick would drop me off and pick me up from my long training runs. I got into the London Marathon 2009 (you have to apply) and I ran for the charity, Children with Leukemia. I raised over 2,000 GBP and ran on my own in 4:48:00:00, just under five hours.  My first child was born on March 18th, 2010. We decided to move back to Canada and bought a house in March 2011. My second child was born on March 14th, 2012 and my third child just 15 months later on June 23, 2013. I had stopped my teaching job a few months before my first child was born and was still an at home mom in June 2014. I found out that I was expecting, my fourth baby on the day of my 7th wedding anniversary, June 25th, 2014. This was only two days after my third child turned one. Around that time, the “panic” of having and raising four children under the age of five set in. My sister had loosely mentioned that there are companies that help to design inventions. So, it was during a nap time in June that I looked into a few companies in Toronto, Canada. I wrote down a few numbers and starting dialing. The first number I called put me through to an automated recording and I decided against leaving a message. Then, I picked up MAKO’s number and called. A REAL, LIVE PERSON picked up the phone and spoke to me right away! I had a really good feeling about this company and during that very first phone call, I was put through to the vice president. I was VERY hesitant to give away too many details about my idea at that time, but he agreed to meet with me for my free consultation. I cannot remember the exact date, but it was mid-August 2014 and I was about 12 weeks pregnant with my fourth child. My dad drove me into Toronto while my mother stayed at home with my three napping children. I pitched my idea to the vice president of MAKO and he liked it. What I have found amazing, as many women have done before me, is how I have never given up. I made time at all costs to get to Toronto (for product development with MAKO) even with a newborn baby, two other toddlers napping at home, and one in her first year of kindergarten. I have never stopped for a second believing in Clasp Magic. Gaps in my timeline were due to waiting for patent protection and monetary funds. I do not have an MBA. I did not get a grant to financially start on this path. I have a loan from my parents and we have a line of credit…I am ALL in! For years, other mothers would ask me, “Oh, do you work?” And before my patent went through in July 2017, I would answer, ”No, I am at home with my children”. The school year of September 2013 through September 2015, I had three young children at home. But I have been working. I was working on something the whole time! I do not have many friends who stayed at home after their third child was born. I don’t personally know many moms of four. My stay-at-home days were hard! I went one year wearing the same seven outfits and I was just happy to be in clean clothes. I had to fully remove myself from social media for this year. It was so upsetting for me to see my close friends on holidays, date nights, lunches with friends, etc. I had little to no freedom in those years. I am not complaining because I have healthy children and the sacrifice was and will always be worth it, but, it was hard living through it at the time. The social media age has changed everything for mothers too. I was so isolated! This was my low self-esteem period. I cannot remember exactly how, but slowly I started to pick myself up. My kids were always perfectly taken care of, they looked amazing, but there was only so much effort I could afford for myself. I looked tired and worse for wear. I still have such little time to get ready in the morning. When I had Clasp Magic’s prototype in my possession, I used it ALL THE TIME!!! Only seconds to accessorize, Clasp Magic got my old Tiffany & Co. bracelets out of the drawer and on my wrists. It is truly amazing how putting on a few accessories transforms your persona. I felt more on top of everything in my life and was more confident when I did. I added makeup back into my routine - which helped too. Mothers noticed and would say, “I don’t know how you do it!” This gave me such pride! This gear shift helped me to work harder than ever. I always work during nap times and evenings. My youngest child is not enrolled in any preschool this year. She has one morning at my parents’ house so I can work on Clasp Magic and I have her with me for the rest of the week. I have still been able to drive progress this year with Clasp Magic. My little student whom I witness lose her battle with cancer 15 years ago is still with me. My life and experience have driven this project from its conception. The idea of not trying, of not bringing Clasp Magic to life, was never a risk I was willing to take. I want to help motivate other women and mothers everywhere with my story! I want to be able to give back to communities of mothers in less fortunate countries. I will always help anyone who asks! This is what life and the world are about.",35.0,1,"1 Campaign

</div></div>","At William Painter, we were tired of all the compromises made in the products we use on a daily basis. While other companies are racing to the bottom, we stand for something more. We believe everyone deserves to have the best products, with the best materials, best manufacturers, and solid customer service that treats you like family.We make products that can keep up with your adventures. That's why we use the most durable materials and back it up with a lifetime guarantee. We truly believe that having trusted everyday accessories will enhance your life and inspire you to be more.                                                                                          You’re a person who needs eyewear to keep up with style. With an iconic silhouette, new age materials, and classic vintage design, The Oasis sets you apart and gets you ready for any occasion.               Titanium frames with the world’s lightest lenses make The Oasis the lightest sunglasses ever! While the fit ensures that the frames stay absolutely secured to your face.These sunglasses are made from the same materials used in a Fighter jet, F1 Race Car, Lamborghini, Bugatti Veyron and many ultra-luxury watches. The Oasis is extremely strong, but also deceptively light.Titanium is also hypoallergenic, meaning it is perfectly safe for the human body. In fact, doctors use it for hip and knee replacements for this very reason. You’re an active person who needs eyewear that can keep up. We examined drill bits, knives, firearms and F1 race car pistons. From this, we developed our own titanium protective coating.   Get out there! Our durable coating has got your back.Ever had sunglasses fall down your nose? We HATE that! Proper sunglass fitting is taken to heart. By using a thick titanium and ultralight lens, we are able to greatly improve the center of balance.Adventure as hard as you want, these puppies aren’t flying off! The Oasis frames come with the highest quality Japanese nylon polarized lenses. They are light, durable, clear and, most impressively, extremely scratch and shatter resistant.We put a hammer to ours just to show you how true this is.Polarization neutralizes glare and drastically reduces eye strain. They work especially well on car windshields, oceans or lakes, and other high glare environments.The problem is most lenses use a polarizing and tint coating added on top of the lenses to achieve this effect. Over time, these coatings bubble and flake off the lens. Ever seen a bad tint job on a car? Same problem.Our LifeLong Lenses integrates both polarizing and tint layers entirely inside the lens rather than just a surface film layer, so it lasts forever. No more peeling tints!We searched around the world looking for the lightest lenses with the best optics - we got them. And for this, they cost us a premium. In fact, it costs more to produce one of our lenses than to produce an entire pair of “high-end” brand lenses.But don’t worry, because we believe in quality products for everyone, we’ll take the hit, so you can get the best. Our frames are made prescription ready. You can take them to your local optometrist and have your prescription put in with ease. Each one of our titanium arms is laser engraved with our challenge to you to “Find Your Oasis”.

<p>Hi, my name is Sophie. I am 12 years old. My mom, some friends and I went to the Women's March in LA on January 21.  I left there feeling more powerful than I've ever felt in my life.</p>
<p>That day was a day I will never forget.  I loved the feeling of speaking my mind along with everyone else that cared so much that they flooded the streets around the world. I wanted my voice to be heard.  And even though my voice may be small, I felt powerful. </p>
<p><br/>I came home that day wishing that I had something that could show how I felt and what I thought.  </p>
<p>So I begged and begged and begged and begged…and begged my mom for a pink hat to wear to school.</p>
<p>But she said that some of the accessories were not practical for everyday use. </p>
<p>So that’s when I came up with an idea… The Power Pom.</p>
<p>I wanted to make something that I could wear, all the time, every day, to show how I felt.  And how I feel. I wanted my voice to be heard.  And I wanted all of my friends and family and everyone else to be able to show how they feel and have their voices heard, too.</p>
<p>I showed my idea to my parents. They thought it was a really great idea and they said would help me bring my idea to life.</p>
<p><br/>Then they showed it to some friends and several more friends and we decided to do a crowdfunding Indiegogo campaign to raise the money and awareness needed to make The Power Pom a reality (or a real life every day wearable statement).  <br/>Everyone wanted to help; moms, daughters, grandmas and even a few dads.</p>
<p>But I wanted to do more.  I wanted to make a difference. My mom and I talked about it and I decided that since 51% of the US population is female…</p>
<p>…we would to give 51% of the profits to Planned Parenthood as way to support the health of women and girls! <br/><br/>We have made a few prototype Power Pom's and want to continue to produce more and more.</p>
<p>You can put The Power Pom on your backpack, purse, stroller, briefcase, bike…anywhere you like.  My hope is that everyone everywhere will want a Power Pom too, to show their support for girls and women and what we believe in every day.  </p>
<p>Get your Pom on now and let your voice be heard.</p>
<p>POWER POM!</p>

</div></div>","Hi, my name is Sophie. I am 12 years old. My mom, some friends and I went to the Women's March in LA on January 21.  I left there feeling more powerful than I've ever felt in my life.
That day was a day I will never forget.  I loved the feeling of speaking my mind along with everyone else that cared so much that they flooded the streets around the world. I wanted my voice to be heard.  And even though my voice may be small, I felt powerful. 
I came home that day wishing that I had something that could show how I felt and what I thought.  
So I begged and begged and begged and begged…and begged my mom for a pink hat to wear to school.
But she said that some of the accessories were not practical for everyday use. 
So that’s when I came up with an idea… The Power Pom.
I wanted to make something that I could wear, all the time, every day, to show how I felt.  And how I feel. I wanted my voice to be heard.  And I wanted all of my friends and family and everyone else to be able to show how they feel and have their voices heard, too.
I showed my idea to my parents. They thought it was a really great idea and they said would help me bring my idea to life.
Then they showed it to some friends and several more friends and we decided to do a crowdfunding Indiegogo campaign to raise the money and awareness needed to make The Power Pom a reality (or a real life every day wearable statement).  Everyone wanted to help; moms, daughters, grandmas and even a few dads.
But I wanted to do more.  I wanted to make a difference. My mom and I talked about it and I decided that since 51% of the US population is female…
…we would to give 51% of the profits to Planned Parenthood as way to support the health of women and girls! We have made a few prototype Power Pom's and want to continue to produce more and more.
You can put The Power Pom on your backpack, purse, stroller, briefcase, bike…anywhere you like.  My hope is that everyone everywhere will want a Power Pom too, to show their support for girls and women and what we believe in every day.  
Get your Pom on now and let your voice be heard.

<h2><strong>What is Show Discipline?</strong></h2>
<p>Show Discipline is a thought-provoking street wear brand for the mavericks that question the standards set by society.  Show Discipline is for those who believe in deeper meanings, reading between the lines, and thinking outside the box.  Those who Show Discipline believe in seeking out information, rather than accepting that which is fed to them on a daily basis.  Those who Show Discipline stay focused and do not allow the everyday distractions of life to divert them from their goals or knock them off course. </p>
<p>Initially Show Discipline will be producing basic clothing items such as graphic tees, sweatshirt, and hats.  In addition we will continue to make films and art pieces to create social awareness and promote an artistic lifestyle.  Overtime we aspire to expand the brand into the realm of cut and sew, creating a full collection of men’s and women’s clothing items ranging from outerwear and denim, to leggings and buttons ups.  Eventually we would like to expand even further, to become a full lifestyle brand producing accessories, leather goods, shoes, and even household products and gadgets such as phone cases, towels, clocks, etc. </p>

<h2><strong>Why Back this Project?</strong></h2>
<p>Show Discipline needs your help to raise brand awareness in order to successfully launch our clothing line</p>
<p> We will be using the money donated to cover the production costs of a capsule collection that will be strategically distributed and sold to trendsetters, artists, and fashionistas who will promote the brand and spread the message.</p>
<p>Funds will also go toward creating one of a kind art/fashion pieces such as limited edition hand painted and patch worked vests, as well as one of a kind paintings we will place around New York City. </p>
<p> We will also be using the funds to cover the costs of basic promotional materials such as business cards, stickers, and flyers.</p>

<h2><strong>Who is Show Discipline?</strong></h2>
<p>Show Discipline is the brainchild of <strong>Jay Jefferson</strong> and <strong>Michelle Sordi</strong>.  Jay grew up in Brooklyn, and has always had a finger on the pulse of the streets.  Growing up during the evolution of both hip hop and the street wear phenomenon has given him a deep understanding of the culture of the street wear market.  Jay was formally trained as an artist working in various mediums, from studying at the High School of Art and Design in New York City.  He continued to cultivate his craft by attending FIT to study fashion design.  After school he worked for several fashion companies including Giorgio Armani and FILA, before straying into the real estate market. He eventually established an appraisal company of his own.  In recent years, Jay has decided to make drastic life changes to return to his passions of art and design.  Through his artistic journey he met Michelle and the two established Show Discipline in 2012.</p>
<p> Michelle on the other hand grew up on Long Island with an infatuation for clothes and design.  She began attending classes in her spare time at the Fashion Institute of Technology when she was 13.  She also attended a fashion design program at a vocational school part time during her junior and senior year of high school, and eventually went on to study fashion design at FIT.  Michelle studied abroad in Milan, Italy during her junior year, where she learned a different approach to design through European training.  She traveled throughout Europe, and was inspired by the art, history, and fashions she saw, which expanded her creativity a geat deal.  After graduation Michelle gained industry experience working for a luxury outerwear company.  During this time she met Jay and decided to take a leap of faith and persue her dream of creating a brand of her own with her new partner in crime.</p>

<h3><strong>Hi - We're Michael, Bryan, and Jay!</strong></h3>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p class=""p1"">We love sports… maybe even too much.  But we have gotten tired of spending tons of money buying our favorite players' jerseys, only to have those players leave the team through free agency, trades, or even worse reasons.</p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>We think we have a solution!  We want to create a ""communal closet"" of officially licensed sports jerseys.</strong>  </p>
<p class=""p1"">Imagine being able to chip in a few dollars to help us purchase a large inventory of jerseys, then having the ability to ""borrow"" a jersey whenever you need it!</p>
<p class=""p1"">We are going to start this with the upcoming basketball season.  If you help us reach our funding goal, we will be able to buy 100 officially licensed NBA jerseys of the league's top 10 best selling players. Then we will send you the jerseys (shipping included!) so you can wear real jerseys without the full costs of buying them!</p>

Proceeds from this line will generate contributions to its particular cause, in this case the “Clean H20 Movement”.To be exact, 10% of the “Conscious Collection” will be donated directly to it’s selected organization.The message will act as a gentle reminder of the true meaning of the shirt, while the artwork accentuates the social issue for each collection. The color of the bcause logo will be determined by the cause. For example, on the firstcollection the logo will be blue.... Representing “Clean H20”.Our “No Paper Trail” philosophy will stray away from paper produced advertising and rely on Digital Media, with acception to some events we wil be related with. A strong web presence with artistic advertisements and photos by way of Tumblr, Pinterest, twitter, Facebook, instagram, blogger, and other means of social networking is how we will spread the word.Along with interesting artist collaborations from a variety of backgrounds and relentless digital campaigning, bcause plans to be a global movement.We are looking for $10,000 and are asking for your support to complete the www.bcausemovement.com site andto produce the initial batch of tees along with the 1st ""Conscious Collection”.Thanks to everyone for their support and thanks for visiting our Indiegogo page!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>HOW HANDI-SHIRT IDEA WAS BORN</strong></p>
<p><strong>After having a stroke about 2 years ago, I spent as much as 10-15 minutes getting my shirt all buttoned-up when getting dressed for church or to go out. I especially had trouble with my top collar button getting it ready to put on a tie. There had to be a better way.</strong></p>
<p><strong>SOLUTION</strong></p>
<p><strong>Eliminating the need for buttons by using a zipper down the front of the shirt and velcro on the sleeves and at the top to secure the neck solved the problem. It reduced my time to get a shirt on and ready for a tie from 10-15 minutes down to less than 1 minute. It's not just for people that are incapacitated but also useful to anyone who just wants to take the hassle out of getting that shirt on.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Th</strong><strong>e goal of $5000.00 in funds is to be used for purchasing the material and hiring enough seamtresses to modify approximmately 120 shirts. If my goal is not reached, I will modify as many shirts as possible with the funds available. The perks for contributions of $45 or more will be one or more HANDI-SHIRTS ,therefore contributions will determine how many will be done and contributers will be the first to benefit.</strong></p>
<p><strong>THE IMPACT</strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>If you yourself  have not experienced the difficulty in putting on a dress shirt and trying to deal  with buttons, especially the top one, then you surely know some who has. I have credibility with many friends and every one of them that I have shared this idea with is truly exicited about it. I look forward to further establishing and developing my market with the contributions I receive through this campaign.</strong></p>
<p><strong>No one will notice the difference when you wear the HANDI-SHIRT. I wear them myself and my friends marvel at the the ease of getting in and out of it.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Multiple shirts must be shipped to a single address, but can be any combination of color (light blue or white) and size you choose. I will obtain your size and color from you via e-mail at the end of the campaign. Big and tall sizes not available at this time.</strong></p>

<h3>Hello, my name is Karan Fortson and a single woman, living in a small city of Michigan, with a disablity.  Because of this, I decided to overcome this obstacle by having a business from home. </h3>
<h3>I've noticed that I have a natural flair for fashion that many women are attracted to.  Starting off with just a few handbags, I have become someone of interest. Women are always asking about upcoming styles and when I will have more product. The problem, I can't purchase enough handbags to jump start the business. </h3>
<h3>In my research I found a wholesale company that will work with me for just $100 minimum. But with $500 and free shipping, this will be enough product to ensure my new handbag business. This is very exciting for me, because I know what the average woman is looking for. </h3>
<h3>Living in a small apartment, this will inspire me to grow the business to eventually serve in a larger capacity. I'm so overjoyed because I know this can happen.  This can be a worldwide change for woman and eventually men who will be able to afford handbags, wallets, briefcases, luggage, doggy carriers, etc. at a miminal cost and look like a million dollars.</h3>
<h3>Contributions can be small, I will appreiciate anything.  Even if the goal is not met, the funds received will start my business.  I just need a chance to make a difference. </h3>
<h3>Please be patient, I do not have a video camera to show a video, nor do I have the latest and greatest computer, not yet, but with your help, it can and will happen.</h3>
<h3>If funding a $1.00 contribution is not of your interest, please share this aritcle with others who may want to assist me.  When 500 people contribute $1.00 each, my goal will be accomplished.</h3>

  The Impact

Students in rural areas, lack access to basic educational infrastructure. As basic as a desk, a bag, a light source to study at night. 91 million students world wide lack access to education.Most of the students in rural part of the world and some in urban as well have to sit down on floor for long studying hours. 9 in 10 people face posture related problems and back injuries at some point of time in their life. Sitting on floor and studying for 6-8 hours affects posture, resulting in back pain, poor eye sight, inefficiency to concentrate and study. 


Rural areas in mostly all the countries face power cuts for several hours. Generally people are habituated to not having access to electricity. 1 in 3 people across the globe lack access to electricity. For households to perform their daily task and for children to study at night, fossil fuel (kerosene / cow dung) is used to create a light source. Mother’s use this light to cook and perform daily tasks, while children use this light source to play, little do they know that the burning biomass fuel can cause death. There are a little more than 500000 deaths in India alone every year due to inhalation of the flames caused by burning biomass. Lacking access to light source forces the children to study in hazardous environment. 

Solution:


YELO, an intelligently designed school bag, helps children carry their books, belonging, irrespective of the weather conditions. The same bag with a single fold technique smartly transforms into a school desk. The desk offers and angle of 30- 35 degrees for students to write and read, thus ensuring they maintain an ergonomic posture while studying.



1 in 3 people across the globe lack access to electricity. Remote areas face heavy power cuts, thereby making it difficult for children to study at night. Yelo is built with a LED light source, to delivering light for more than 6-8 hours, thus empowering students and rural household to carry out their evening chores.



Yelo comes with a handy solar kit that powers the LED light. The rechargeable battery in solar kit can be charged through solar energy as well as supports AC charging. Solar kit can also be used for other application like charging mobile phones in case of emergency.
What we Need & What You Get

 We need your support to implement YELO at schools in rural areas of third world countries. We have started distribution of free samples in rural villages of India. 
Help us reach our funding goal in order to manufacture and implement samples in rural areas of Rajasthan. We have interesting perks for the support you are to offer for lighting the lives of millions across the globe.

  Other Ways You Can Help Help us to spread the awareness about the cause by sharing our campaign on social media platform.",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

Used to either disguise or reveal a personality trait, masks are present in every culture throughout History. The Sound Reactive LED Mask takes a step forward.    It integrates art and technology into a very versatile device that mesmerizes anyone who sees it.     The LED Mask transcribes any sort of music and any type of rhythm into amazing Illuminations.    Our masks are easily wearable, foldable and adjustable. As a costume or music accessory for any occasion, they are the perfect companion.     After successfully completing our first Kickstarter campaign we are proud to introduce to you our new collection.    Help to spread the word about The Sound Reactive LED Masks by Outline Montréal. Hit one of the buttons below!                    The LED Mask* is powered by phosphorus ink paired with a lithium modulator. OK, but what’s phosphorus ink? A material that consumes minimal power, is cold to the touch and emits a very captivating glow. This is the same technology that is used in watches to light the faces. The modulator converts the sound waves into programmed patterns creating pure organic light.     
 
Sound responsive lithium modulator - Our most advanced piece of technology. The modulator is powered by a lithium-ion battery (DC5V). It is much smaller and lighter than our previous one, cutting the overall weight of the mask in half.
Adjustable straps - The straps are easy to set up and fits any head size.
Hidden cable - The cable is now completely hidden inside the strap. 
Protective foam - A 1mm piece of high-density foam, protects the mask while being comfortable to wear.
Phosphorus layer - Phosphorus ink screen printed on a translucent conductor. 
Printed design - High quality printed colors applied on a PWB layer. 
Weight - 80 g / 2.82 oz* patent pendingThe LED mask is a companion that you can bring with you anytime or anywhere there’s music. It is lightweight, malleable and can easily fit in your pocket or bag. Wear it and you will become instantly part of the sensation. During your private parties, festivals or even displayed in your living room - this mask suits any setting.                The brilliant designs of our collaborators Patrick Seymour and BÜRO UFHO, supported by the valuable feedback of our community, inspired this collection. These eight new designs are the result of incredible teamwork. Now that you know everything about it, which LED Mask do you feel best describes your own style?                                        How to power-up your LED Mask?   Just press the button located behind your head and it’s on.     To adjust the mask’s sensitivity, turn the wheel on the side.     We improved the global structure of the mask by relocating the modulator - now located on the back of your head. The cable, connecting the modulator to the mask, is integrated and hidden within the adjustable strap giving you total comfort and mobility.   As noted by our backers, when the source of the sound was too close or too loud, the mask did not properly capture the beat of the music. We worked on the modulator and we significantly upgraded its sensitivity to better decipher the rhythm with minimal interference.                   We are a team of creative entrepreneurs from Montréal with a strong interest in art and music. Fascinated by masked artists, we always believed that people express themselves differently when disguised. The idea of identity vanishes and the real you rises when wearing a mask.    Two years ago you supported our vision to make our first sound reactive LED Mask.The Kickstarter community and our early adopters believed in us before anyone else even knew we existed. After the first campaign, our team grew from three to six members, totally dedicating ourselves to the electro-luminescent technology. Now we need your help to bring our company further and create new masks with worldwide artists.We have our working prototypes, but demand for our products is constantly growing and we need a better way to get you our masks. With your help, we can start the production of our final products and make sure everything runs as seamlessly as possible.Your help will go directly into further improving our technology, make new collaborations and bring even more designs to life. #outlinemontreal #ledmask        Available in EN, FR, ES, IT, PT, DE, JP              You can get in touch with us, using Indigogo’s messaging service, Messenger or via email at contact@outline-montreal.com. Our team will be available around the clock to respond to any questions or feedback.  Is shipping included?

It makes your clothes-photos getting attention on daily basis, exactly as in real life. Also you see what is currently being worn on the planet, not what has been recently uplaoded.<p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>WHY TO SHARE OUTFIT PHOTO?</h3><p></p><p>We probably do not have to convince you...<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">but if yes, then think over if you are catching yourself as finding the way for glancing at the various glass surfaces - like on this <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41hnzZH0AMU"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">video</a></span></p><p>There is a peacock inside each of us. We are not fashion victims but we mind a look. We put an effort to buy the clothes which suit us, to wear them properly. Would be great to exhibit it widely.</p><p>(seeing outfit photos of others is also an extreme fun)</p><p></p><p></p><h3>VIDEO</h3><ul><li>IT IS NOT ABOUT MONEY, IT IS ABOUT APPRECIATION - WE DO THINGS FOR FREE!</li></ul><p></p><p>Most of the scenes of the video above were captured with mobile phone camera.</p><p>To make professional video is not a big cost comparing to development app, but we had doubts if to put our money for recording professional video. It would cost us about 300-400$ for recording &amp; professional video editing, and at current moment, we are in the point, where each dollar counts...</p><p>But...if we see that you like the idea, it will be a great motivation for us to spend such money and do so. The movie will be explaining Lookminders idea by the same scenario so hands &amp; table, but much better captured [we will rent an HD camera]  &amp; edited [we will hire a professionalist to do it] . Also with much better spokesman ;) without the crowdfudning part. </p><p>How you can help us? Just click on any of the appreciation button (facebook like, tweet google plus) in the bottom of the video located ""Share this campaign"". If we get 500 in total for all the counters (fb, tweet, g+) by 10th of January, we will record the HQ vid, just because we will get that some of you like the idea!</p><p>To confirm - this goal is not connected with money.

It makes your clothes-photos getting attention on daily basis, exactly as in real life. Also you see what is currently being worn on the planet, not what has been recently uplaoded.WHY TO SHARE OUTFIT PHOTO?We probably do not have to convince you...but if yes, then think over if you are catching yourself as finding the way for glancing at the various glass surfaces - like on this videoThere is a peacock inside each of us. We are not fashion victims but we mind a look. We put an effort to buy the clothes which suit us, to wear them properly. Would be great to exhibit it widely.(seeing outfit photos of others is also an extreme fun)VIDEOIT IS NOT ABOUT MONEY, IT IS ABOUT APPRECIATION - WE DO THINGS FOR FREE!Most of the scenes of the video above were captured with mobile phone camera.To make professional video is not a big cost comparing to development app, but we had doubts if to put our money for recording professional video. It would cost us about 300-400$ for recording & professional video editing, and at current moment, we are in the point, where each dollar counts...But...if we see that you like the idea, it will be a great motivation for us to spend such money and do so. The movie will be explaining Lookminders idea by the same scenario so hands & table, but much better captured [we will rent an HD camera]  & edited [we will hire a professionalist to do it] . Also with much better spokesman ;) without the crowdfudning part. How you can help us? Just click on any of the appreciation button (facebook like, tweet google plus) in the bottom of the video located ""Share this campaign"". If we get 500 in total for all the counters (fb, tweet, g+) by 10th of January, we will record the HQ vid, just because we will get that some of you like the idea!To confirm - this goal is not connected with money. We can have 0$ raised for project, but if there is 500 in total of all counters, we will record a movie, by end of January! Try us - it costs you nothing.FEATHERS In the video there is disruption of voice at. Thats because in original version we have recorded it with wrong pronounciation. So now we are smarter. We know how to pronounce that. For ever. Here it goes: http://www.forvo.com/word/feather/STORY SO FAR - WHAT HAS BEEN DONELookminders idea was born in 2011. First of all was the web app, the fully-featured & working Lookminders app and the technical basis of the planned mobile apps. Most of development of it has happened in the 2nd half of 2012 and has been finalised early 2013. The cost (development, logo & interface desing, infrastructure) was covered from the founder's private savings. Unfotunately curently I am not able to do the same with mobile apps - we ve run out of money.Of course there are thing to be improved, but for current moment we need to focus on...WHAT IS NEXT? - THE GOAL OF THE PROJECTThe goal is the launch the mobile apps of Lookminders for two main platforms - Android & iOs devices. The fact that Lookminders is an photo-sharing app, makes sure that it wil benefit a lot from launching mobile-instance.The app will be almost fully featured, means it will allow:- user sign up- indicating current outfit (""putting on"" your clothes) - by drag & drop feature, so you ll feel like taking your clothes off from the hanger!- exploring & interacting others' outfits- reviewing action history (""my taste"")what will be not available in mobile instance from the moment of first release are:

account settings managment - password reset, email address setting etc. It will be introduced in future

multi-language serving, so it will be in english only
What is important, that some of the things have been already done! We have:

basic layout design for all the screens, but it needs a shaping for sure


developed webservices for mobile-app to server communication

So what is still be done, is pure android & iOs development + layout polishing.Total estimated fund we need for this is 6000$. This will be mostly spent on external Android & iOs developers, who will produce the code and smaller part for graphic designer.Estimated time of delivery is March of 2014 for the android app and April 2014 for the iOs app - beta version available for public. We ve already introduced all the requirements & technical documentation to the mentioend mobile-developers. We need about 2 months per platform, but for some period two jobs can go paralelly.IMPORTANT: the project may be posted on various crowd-funding platforms. thats why we are pledging less on each, not the total amount which is needed. Upcoming weeks we will be posting an updates about current status of ongoing campaigns over the our social media pages.OUR PERKSLet us introduce what you can get...Hand-written thank you letter - 6$Standard thanks are also long-lasting, but having it paper-stated makes it nice memento of the fact that you helped us.

</div></div>","TailTalker was born while crossing a railroad track looking at the hitch receiver on the truck in front of me as it went high enough to see the whole assembly underneath.  I was making up ""political"" bumper stickers in my head trying to think of a catchy way to get more attention.  I started thinking about the $335 hitch receiver I had just installed on my truck and how it probably wouldn't be used 1% of the time after all that money I had  spent on it.     Then it hit me...we could use the hitch receiver 100% of it's life and the associated running lights, brake lights and turn signal lighting circuits that come with it to ""light up"" my bumper sticker so it could be seen day or night, even in foggy or snowy conditions.  My mind started racing as I thought about a safety hitch cover with the LED lights grabbing all motorist attention for your presence or turning/braking intentions.  TheTailTalker would make those behind you always be aware of you...and even better, read your bumper sticker.     That was in 2010 that the patent search, the prototype build and the ""real world"" R & D began.  The initial TailTalker (my wife named it), was a stamped metal tray, 28"" x 4"" with a plastic receiver tube screwed on and 4-1157 duel element tail light bulbs in 4 holes (2 on each side) and a red translucent lens with a GEORGIA BULLDOGS vinyl stencil covering the 4"" x 28"" frame.  Example below, bottom white metal w/1157 bulbs.1st, 2nd, and 3rd progressions w/TailTalker (PHOTO ABOVE; 1ST, 2ND, and 3RD PROGRESSIONS OF TAILTALKER)             It was just what I wanted with running lights showing everybody behind me Georgia Bulldogs in the night.  Even in the daylight my right turn would flash a bright red Bulldogs, Bulldogs, Bulldogs and the left turn flashed Georgia, Georgia, Georgia.  Then I'd hit my brakes to show the whole world a brilliant red Georgia Bulldogs.  I finally had my obnoxious, attention getting Georgia Bulldogs illuminated bumper sticker.     The patent process, prototype build and the R & D are interrelated as developing ideas for improvement demand rewriting and change.  Here is a diamond plate step model with a new LED light that didn't work.  Step model w/red LED's.  Didn't work but gave us the start on ALL-METAL TT(PHOTO ABOVE; 1ST STEP MODEL w/RED LED's.  DIDN'T WORK.) Experimenting with different materials, adhesives, light designs and all the people that are experts with these items is exciting and rewarding.  FUNNY, everyone sees the TailTalker and immediately suggests a ""smart phone"" programable message you could change (on the fly) but the DOT considers that a ""distraction"" and is ILLEGAL.  The R & D is not for the faint of heart.  Spending 4 hours to put something together, only to have it shake apart in the first 2 miles can be discouraging.  (3 different LED trials)(PHOTO ABOVE; 3 DIFFERENT LED LIGHT TRIALS)The TailTalker has been destroyed and pieces of some of the first derivations are scattered on roads all over Atlanta.  The TailTalker is not indestructible but is designed and tested to take a lot of abuse.     The funding I'm seeking is to afford efficiencies of scale.            A.  We have a 1st run of 300 TailTalkers in production now that will be used for rewards but the manufacturing process was slow and expensive.  These will be complete and ready to ship in July, 2014.          B.  The LED lights we install utilize about 98 lites per unit so we need to order by May to receive in 6 weeks to fulfill 3000 TailTalkers by July 30th for reward shipment.            C.  The wiring harnesses are soldered, wired, labeled and shipped to an assembly line where we will employ the disabled veterans to assemble the components for shipping.  This sub-contractor is in place.Coil cord (no one has) old LEDs & hand wired  (COIL CORD {no one has} OLD LED lite strips & HAND WIRED)        D.  The injection molding of the lens frame (injection mold costs $25,000) produces the best parts cheaper and faster. The mold is a high cost item that could take 6-8 weeks to machine.  This is a crucial step but our CAD files are ready to select the mold maker and here your funds make or break this plan.These parts injection molded NOTE: old LED Lites that DIDN'T WORK  (INJECTION MOLDED PARTS W/OLD LITE STRIPS, TEMPORARY WIRING)        E.  Although our present office is based near Atlanta, Georgia where we assemble TailTalkers now by hand.  A facility search may yield savings or tax credits for bringing new employment and light manufacturing to a particularly depressed area.  Your funding will provide mass production of the TailTalker  with a retail price of $35 - $50.          GOAL; This auto accessory will take 30,000,000 seldom used $300 - $400 hitch receivers and make them useful 100% of the time for safety and messaging. You, as a sponsor, could be the first to show others the potential of this device and take huge satisfaction and pride knowing you promoted new employment, manufacturing and all those TailTalkers you see as you are driving down the highway.  Please join me.EXAMPLES OF SOME REWARDS FOR PLEDGES

<h2>Short Summary</h2>
<p>Hello - Thank you for checking out our IndieGogo project! <a href=""http://www.dmariearchive.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""D'Marie"">D'Marie</a> is a fiesty start-up with a clear goal to not just change existing e-commerce infrastructure systems, but replace them completely. However, we now need your financial support to complete our next step; the D'Marie mobile app! </p>
<p>Allow me to give you a bit of background on the company. <a href=""http://www.dmariearchive.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""D'Marie"">D'Marie</a> was first incorporated in NYC about 18 months ago. Our team's background in fashion spans from casting New York Fashion Week to producing fashion photoshoots for top clothing brands. Our vast experience led us to understand that in order to solve the consumer question ""Where can I buy that?"", we had to tackle a larger industry issue. It's no secret that the fashion and tech industries have never been in sync with one another. If you think about it, the evolution of the internet and e-commerce came after the industry was already using brick and mortar distribution methods via boutiques and large department stores. Ever since the internet and social media came along, it has been a scramble for designers and industry members to replace outdated processes with new technical solutions. Alright, enough with the history lesson... onto the reason you're here!</p>

<p><strong>D'Marie's moble app will enable you, the shopper, to do the following:</strong></p>
<p><strong>(*Images above are not finalized product)</strong></p>
<p>- Search and shop any garment seen in a television show, advertisement, editorial, film, music video, red carpet image or celebrity press photo. Once we identify the image you were looking for, we'll connect you directly to the retailer where you can make the purchase!</p>
<p>- Walk into any participating retail store, scan an item's tag and view an entire ""IMBD-esque"" history of where in media the garment or accessory has been seen (i.e. Mindy Kaling might wear a certain leather jacket in an episode of her show. Then, the next week, Lady Gaga might throw it on after her concert for a press meeting. D'Marie can keep you updated with this type of info).</p>
<p>- Browse our editor's selections of ""looks for less."" Listen, we totally understand that you might not be able to purchase a Prada bag, but that shouldn't stop you from rocking the look. We're here to help with that.</p>
<p>- Share your favorite looks with friends using Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest, Tumblr and Instagram.</p>
<p>- Receive notifications of when and where a garment or accessory will be available to purchase. <em>Question</em>: have you ever searched endlessly to find something you see the Red Carpet? We have. Here's a little secret: sometimes brands are guilty of promoting garments that aren't immediately available online. D'Marie will stand in line for you and the moment an item is available to purchase online you will be the first to know!</p>
<p><strong>D'Marie's mobile app will enable industry professionals (i.e. designers, stylists, celebrities, brands) to do the following:</strong></p>
<p>- Share content and updates with D'Marie followers so they can build their brand's identity and increase website traffic and online sales.</p>
<p>- Utilize their account tools remotely on set and out of office to increase productivity. </p>
<p>- Publish ""shoppable"" content faster and more seemlessly so consumers can review the latest fashion news possible.</p>
<p>The success of this IndieGogo project is critical to the expansion of our brand. Our team has ridden the rollercoaster that is being a start-up. We know that what we want to acheive is attainable with your help and the success of this project. <strong>Our technology is evolving to position D'Marie to become the ""Shazam of Fashion"".</strong> </p>

<h2>What We Need </h2>
<p>The amount of funding we raise from IndieGogo will directly effect the features of the application. We want this to be the best user experience, so we have set the bar at $25,000. To create this app we need funding to do the following:</p>
<p>- Complete designs for the app's UI/UX.</p>
<p>- Contract a lean team of developers to code the application and then sync the data    between our site and mobile platforms.</p>
<p>- Properly test the application within the industry and consumer markets</p>

<p>$50 - You are too kind. As a gesture of our appreciation, please accept the featured T-shirt with a signature D'Marie design.

<p>We are two women who love menswear-style footwear, and have long lamented the lack of quality options in this arena for women and people with small(er) feet. <b>Over the years we've met and commiserated with countless other women, trans, and non-binary folk over the exact same question: why don't these shoes come in our sizes? </b></p>
<p><b><b>We believe that style transcends gender lines, and moreso, that this is neither revolutionary nor a trend.</b> <br/></b></p>
<p>With our combined backgrouds of footwear design and digital advertising, we decided to solve the problem ourselves. Our collection is inspired by traditional menswear styles and updated with materials like vegetable tanned leather and Vibram soles. <b>Determined to make the shopping experience a more inclusive one, we will be producing our shoes in all sizes, for all genders.</b> </p>

<h3>What is vegetable tanned leather NOT?</h3>
<p>Veggie tan is not:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>cheap. Veggie tan is one of the most expensive leathers because it takes much longer to produce than chrome-tanned leathers (weeks vs days.) For a product that should be heirloom quality, there is no alternative, so we think the extra cost is more than worth it!</b></li>
<li>
<b>vegetarian or vegan.</b> Leather is leather- and ours comes from Portuguese and Spanish cows. </li>
</ul>
<h3><b>What makes vegetable tanned leather great?</b></h3>
<p><b>Veggie tan leather is an heirloom quality material: it gets better with age.</b> We love it because it grows with you. Many commercial leathers are finished with plastics and/or paints which covers up the natural beauty of the material. We love seeing the natural properties of veggie tan evolve with time and use. </p>
<h3>Our tannery</h3>
<p><b>Our factory is one of three tanneries in Portugal that still produces vegetable tanned leather.</b> Added bonus: they're located mere kilometers from our factory, which is great for several reasons. It means that once our production leathers are complete, they can reach our factory in minutes, enabling production to begin as soon as possible.

Who we are

Photo credit: Honor Kennedy
Two sisters from San Francisco with a dream. Now living in Berlin and NYC respectively, we have travelled the world and found one universal truth (at least): an adherence to outdated ideas of what women want to wear. We are simply two individuals of many who crave a change in the way fashion treats gender- and we're here to do our part. 
Our Mission
We are two women who love menswear-style footwear, and have long lamented the lack of quality options in this arena for women and people with small(er) feet. Over the years we've met and commiserated with countless other women, trans, and non-binary folk over the exact same question: why don't these shoes come in our sizes? 
We believe that style transcends gender lines, and moreso, that this is neither revolutionary nor a trend. 
With our combined backgrouds of footwear design and digital advertising, we decided to solve the problem ourselves. Our collection is inspired by traditional menswear styles and updated with materials like vegetable tanned leather and Vibram soles. Determined to make the shopping experience a more inclusive one, we will be producing our shoes in all sizes, for all genders. 













Available color options:

We had so much demand for a black colorway that we couldn't say no. We do not have existing pairs in black, however our tannery has sent us swatches and we know it's going to be gorgeous.


Why choose Matriarch?







Quality is built into every single detail of our shoes:


We use vegetable tanned leather for the upper AND lining. Many shoes are built to look pretty on the outside, and compromise on the inner details to cut down on costs. We were having none of this, so we made sure that the lining- the part that's closest to your skin- is of the utmost quality. The softness of the lining makes for an especially lovely experience when you slip on the boots. 

For our ripple-soled boots, we used the best quality outsoles available, from Vibram.There are imitations out there that are much cheaper, but ours will last you much longer than any imitation would. 

For our leather-sole shoes, we use a double layer forefoot for long-lasting wear, plus a stacked leather heel. Many brands (even the most expensive luxury ones!) use other materials like MDF (compressed fiberboard) for their heels which is much cheaper, and can also warp when exposed to the elements. 



A discouraging reality of the consumer goods industry is that products are often created for men as a default, and then modified in some way so as to be suitable for women. We consider this 'strategy' insulting to all genders and instead recognize and celebrate the diversity in personal aesthetic choices. As a way of evening the playing field, we're offering beautiful, sustainable shoes in the full size range. 


What is vegetable tanned leather, exactly?
Vegetable-tanned leather is:




Free of the heavy metals found substantially in most commercially-produced leathers.

While it is slightly less precise than a battery-powered quartz movement it is the ultimate example of exquisite watchmaking tradition.<br/><br/><b>Why do people choose automatic watches?

It was thicker than we had imagined. We measured and realised that it was 13 millimeter. +30% thicker than our original requirement. <i>Fail</i>.

Kill the project<br/>2. Compromise and go with the thicker version<br/>3. Start from scratch and make the impossible possible</p><p>Killing the project never seemed like much of an option but at the same time we were now dealing with a manufacturing partner that couldn't keep their word. Plus, the product wasn't what we had originally imagined. </p><p><b>""But it can't be impossible"" we thought. Just tricky and time consuming.

Instead, it's wound by the motion of your wrist. The rotor pivots freely around a spindle, and a movement in either direction helps to rewind the mainspring. The watch is then regulated by a spiral balance wheel that vibrates 28,800 times per hour. While it is slightly less precise than a battery-powered quartz movement it is the ultimate example of exquisite watchmaking tradition.Why do people choose automatic watches? Because they realise that the traditional art of fine watchmaking demands a perfect balance of engineering, art and style.If you go back in time pre-1990 and study watch trends and history you'll learn that the size for men's watches have traditionally been around 35-37mm. As the conspicuous consumption grew throughout the 80's-00's so did the width of the average wrist watch.Lately though, the pendulum has begun to swing back the other way with a return to small but masculine luxury watches. ""Jumbo-watch fatigue are setting in"" - to quote New York Times.“The more a man is secure about his masculinity and his taste, the more he can play with the traditional codes of masculinity,” said Pierre Rainero, director of image, style and heritage at Cartier.As timepiece aficionado's, in our quest to find the perfect watch, we quickly realised that a small and thin 36mm automatic watch simply didn't exist. Not unless you were willing to wear a female timepiece, pay thousands of dollars for a vintage watch or settle for a cheap battery-driven Quartz.The combination of high quality and reasonable price didn't exist.""Jumbo-watch fatigue is setting in."" - New York TimesBringing to life the product that we were so desperately searching for we've worked with watchmakers and movement manufacturers from all over the world with the seven following requirements:1/ Self-winding automatic movement2/ 36mm case width 3/ Less than 10mm thick4/ Slim, comfortable & easy-to-read5/ Aesthetically pleasing, timeless and minimalistic design6/ Handmade high-quality leather strap 7/ Priced below $400We wrote those 7 requirements back in early 2015 and have been working ever since on bringing our vision to life. It's been almost a year and we've spent thousands of dollars on prototyping and design. It's been a bumpy ride.Here's a short story to illustrate one of the many challenges we've had to deal with in the last year:In early talks with our manufacturing partner we outlined our requirement and were promised that the watch case would be no thicker than 10 millimeter. With a battery-driven Quartz movement this isn't that much of a challenge but it gets trickier when you opt for an automatic.The mechanical movement component itself was 5.98mm, leaving us with just 4.01mm for the entire watch case. Tight, but our manufacturing partner gave us their word and said that it would be possible.We waited and waited some more and then first prototype arrived. It was thicker than we had imagined. We measured and realised that it was 13 millimeter. +30% thicker than our original requirement. Fail. Our partner apologised and told us it would be impossible to fullfil the requirement at the desired cost.That's not what you want to hear from your partner when you're 6 months into a project.And so at this point we had 3 options:1. Kill the project2. Compromise and go with the thicker version3. Start from scratch and make the impossible possibleKilling the project never seemed like much of an option but at the same time we were now dealing with a manufacturing partner that couldn't keep their word. Plus, the product wasn't what we had originally imagined. ""But it can't be impossible"" we thought. Just tricky and time consuming. So we went back to square one.It wasn't easy or cheap, but it was the right thing to do. We got ourselves new advisors, a new manufacturing partner, built a new prototype and replaced the movement with one measuring just 3.90mm.We explained the requirement to our new manufacturing partner and they got back to us with the good news: The watch is just 9.76mm thin. Could it really be?This time around we demanded proof and received this picture:What we're trying to say is this:The fine art of watchmaking can be expressed in many forms and our philosophy is that the movement contains as much art as the case, dial and rest of your watch.And so each component of the watch had to be carefully crafted to fit its 67 different parts on 36mm - and also make sure the entire watch was no thicker than 10mm. Opting for a self-winding automatic instead of a battery-driven Quartz even forced us to order a custom-made Japanese Citizen Movement.With a touch of Italian luxury and Swedish craftmanship, Inspired by The 60s Era of Mad Men, we proudly present Boetti - The Worlds First 36mm Automatic Watch For Less Than $400. The combination of Italian Copper Brown Leather and Stainless Steel Gold? Remarkable, we dare to say - And at 36mm it will be the most comfortable watch you've ever had on your wrist.Choose between Brown Leather/Stainless Steel Gold or Black leather/Stainless Steel. The straps are interchangeable. Boetti borrows from both Swedish and Italian. Boett meaning watch case in Swedish and Stretti meaning narrow in Italian. Put the two of them together and you'll get Boetti; ""narrow watch case"". The ultramarine blue seconds hand pays tribute to the famous Italian painter Cennino Cennini. During the Renaissance, Ultramarine was the finest and most expensive blue that could be used by painters and was often used to symbolize holiness and humility.""Ultramarine blue is a color illustrious, beautiful, the most perfect, beyond all other colors; one could not say anything about it, or do anything with it, that its quality would not still surpass"" - Cennino CenniniOne could not say anything about it, or do anything with it, that its quality would not still surpass. Today, more than 500 years later, our watches are built with the very same aspiration.It's the type of watch you'll spot from across the room. A real head turner. Now ask yourself:  Are you man enough for a small watch?Handmade Italian leather in tan suede brown or black leather. Sourced from a small artisan within Tuscany region in Italy, each strap is crafted by hand. Due to the unique nature of the tan suede leather material combined with the human element of their construction, each strap has a true personality all on its own.Each component of the Boetti is carefully crafted to fit its 67 different parts on 36mm and at the same time make sure the entire watch was is no thicker than 10mm. Opting for a self-winding automatic instead of a battery-driven quartz lead us to use a custom-made Self-winding Japanese Citizen Movement.After thorough evaluation, research and prototyping we decided on the Citizen 9015 movement from Japan. The combination of economical design and its reputation as being one of the most dependable automatic self-winding movements on the market made it the perfect movement to guarantee maximum performance at a reasonable price.The open skeleton case back (covered by scratch resistant sapphire Crystal) allows you to view the watch's movement and get a glimpse into the very soul of the Boetti.Case: Stainless Steel Glass: Sapphire Crystal, scratch resistant Dial material: Ceramic Second Hand Dial color: Ultramarine Blue Case dimension: 36mm Thickness: 9.76mm Dial color: Porcelain White Movement origin: Japanese, custom-made Citizen 9015 Movement type: Self-Winding Automatic Movement Parts: 67Movement jewels: 24Movement vibrations: 28,800 VPH Power reserve: 42 Hours Strap: Handmade Italian Tan Suede Leather or Black LeatherStrap colour: Boetti Copper Brown or Black LeatherComplication: DateWater resistance classification: 5ATM (Suitable for showering or swimming in shallow water.)There's a 80 day production lead time from order to final delivery.

Slip into wide open shoes as if there were no laces at all. 
Close with a simple magnetic click.
Remove your shoes hands-free.
No more ugly messy bows. Just a clean looking shoe.
Shiny Gold & Chrome add bling to your kicks.
Magnetically pair up your shoes and organize them in new places. 
Without laces, your shoes double as easy slippers.




 
Give Zubits a try - Zubits closures have thousands of positive reviews from all sorts of people!



 
Amazing Strength - Zubits high-tech magnets are incredibly strong. Really, you won't believe it. They can hold up to 17lbs of force and stay secure for running, parkour, going to the gym, or playing recreational sports. Thanks to Bay Area Movement for the parkour (bamvmnt.com)!

Fast, simple, magnetic closing - Just pull the magnets together and close with a click. 

Wide open shoes - Easily slip into wide open shoes. No more squeezing or reversing laces to get in.

Pop out hands-free - Firmly step on your opposite heel and lift ankle to pop out hands-free. 

Re-use on new shoes - Buy one pair of Zubits and re-use them on all your new pairs of shoes. The magnets never lose their strength.

A clean looking shoe - Lose the floppy bows and get a clean looking shoe. Plus, keep the laces that were designed for your shoes.


Shoes become slippers - With a wide open shoe and no laces dragging on the ground, many people use Zubits closures just like slippers for short use like getting the mail or walking around the campsite.

3 Sizes - After the campaign ends, you will be sent a survey asking you to choose your preferred size and color for each pair of Zubits closures you purchased. The survey will explain the size choices thoroughly to help you decide. Larger sizes hold more secure but are harder to split open. Smaller sizes are easier for kids to open yet strong enough for play and running.

Bling, style, flair - Add some serious bling to your kicks. Clean up those floppy laces. And of course, make your sneakers easier.

Active & athletic use - Zubits closures are incredibly strong. They keep up with your various athletic needs.

A clean look, no messy bows - Get a clean looking shoe without a floppy bow. Now more than ever, Zubits closures give you style.

Many Uses - Magnets do many things... helping those with special needs, organizing shoes, making shoes easier for kids, making lots of activities easier!

<h3>UPDATE!!!</h3>
<p>The best MMA website online <a href=""http://www.cagepotato.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.cagepotato.com</a> has helped join our cause to promote our product.  Anyone who has already purchased a bag or purchases a bag before December 9th will receive a free set of MMA gloves  and hand wraps sent out before Christmas - COMPLIMENTS OF CAGEPOTATO!!!</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Michael Williamson and I'm looking for your support.  </p>
<p>I started boxing roughly 27 years ago and have stayed active through other martial arts and coaching ever since.  </p>
<p>I've developed and patented a product that brings technology to a sport that hasn't evolved since the use of velcro.  </p>
<p>This punching bag will communicate with your computer, tablet or cell phone via a bluetooth connection and will track your work out.  It will keep count of how many strikes you throw as well as how hard they are.  This information has never been available for athletes.  You will be able to compete online or compare your workout results with anyone else in the country or hopefully the world.  </p>
<p>I have put together an experienced and motivated team, with your help we can bring this one of a kind product to market and change the way people train.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>Selling a wireless product in Canada and/or the U.S. requires government testing.  The money raised will cover testing with both governments, we will redesign the circuit board to lower our cost per unit and of course manufacture our first production run.  </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>This will change the way people train... not just competitors who want to know how much power or stamina they lose with a weight cut... but for beginners who want to learn but cannot afford a monthly membership, have no way to the gym or just simply are too shy to try an individual sport.  </p>
<p>With this product complete it will give us the opportunity to launch our second product that will allow people to monitor and even prevent concussions before they happen.  This is already designed and will be useful for not just boxing but any contact sport, making kids safer.</p>
<p>Having an impact on the sport is not our only goal, having worked in the IBEW I know how important local jobs and manufacturing can be.  All of our research and development has been, and will continue to be sourced in North America.  Assembly of the product will be handled locally and if at all possible, parts will be made here as well.  </p>
<p>Boxing and martial arts changed my life.  My coach was like a second father to me and I can't imagine my youth without his influence.  Small clubs have a hard time surviving and we will always be looking to assist those clubs.  Focusing on this full time will give us the ability to do that.  At the end of the day, I've been involved in boxing and martial arts my entire life and my goal is to make a difference in the sport and the community.</p>
