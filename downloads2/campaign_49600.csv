<p style=""text-align: center;"">The Scarlett Project truly means the world to me. I've been working on it on and off since 2015. It started out as a short story that slowly kept evolving into a feature film script. The script is cute, funny and relatable... but it's also terrifying, nerve wracking and brutal.

<p style=""text-align: center;"">The first person I reached out to about it was Tom Komisar (aka Mr. Byars).

<p style=""text-align: center;"">If you're wondering; I have made four Indiegogo campaigns for four separate projects in the past.

The difference with this Scarlett campaign is that I'm currently in Pre-Production and this film won't be completed for a while.

After months of grieving over her mother's untimely passing, a girl named Scarlett tries to push forward with her life and follow in her mother's footsteps. She soon finds herself trapped in the clutches of her delusional professor's home. Paralyzed and unable to fight back, Scarlett's only option is to hope the drugs wear out in time... before it's too late.
 
This is the second feature film by writer/director Samuel Vainisi; his first feature film 'Violet' was released on BD-R in early March of 2020, and the film is also available to watch for free through Amazon Prime as of 7/24/20! Link below <3

<h3>Who we are</h3>
<p>My name is Matthew Lee Anderson, co-founder of independent production company Key 13 Film Partners. Craig M. Rosenthal and I created Key 13 to make films that everyone could enjoy and feed our creative drive.  We are no strangers to the hard work required to make a movie. Between the two of us, we have over 20 years of filmmaking experience.  We are excited to move into the next phase in our filmmaking careers.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1613230420/cqewu2qvvpmm4qmagioq.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>""Serious Profession"" is going to be the first full length feature film for Key 13. This idea was created over 20 years ago and has always been a goal to make. Already, the script has won an award (the first of many we hope). Completing this film will not only be a dream come true, it will showcase the skills of the talented people who work on, and make films in the Washington DC area and beyond. Plus, how many independent films start off with an award winning script? Not many!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1613230329/jvfipaguucwpbo5k2hmy.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>By donating, you will not only bring this award winning script into reality but provide employment for many hard working (and serious) entertainment professionals who have been struggling due to COVID.</p>
<h3>Already off with a bang!</h3>
<p>We were over 20% funded in the first three days, 30% in just our first week! We have some new producers, several extras, and quite a few other surprises. One perk, the ""Name the Boss"" perk completely changed the nationality of the crime boss. How's that for making your perk super cool!</p>
<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1617915460/biyiash0c8qctzh1zkx9.jpg"" src=""""/></h3>
<h3>What your funding provides!</h3>
<p>To just get started, we need $13,000. That money will go to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Paying the cinematographer and the gaffer (lighting guy)</li>
<li>Paying the actors</li>
<li>Use of a police car and buying/renting any equipment we need</li>
<li>Feeding the cast and crew</li>
</ul>
<p>On average, it will cost us $1300 a day (somedays more, somedays less) to pay everyone, keep them fed, and create a great looking movie. Every 10% we raise is another day of filming.</p>
<p>If we go over that amount, there is a lot more we can do to improve the film. We can rent/purchase better equipment to give us more options to make the film look really polished.  Andrew Stainer our composer is scoring the entire film without compensation so it's only fair to pay him for his time (he is donating his time because he believes in this project). We can hire a sound engineer, key grip, and other important persons that are needed so we can focus on the performances. We can also pay the volunteers and those who donated time and effort to help make the posters and other swag. The truth is, if everyone on our Facebook pages just donated $15, we will get this movie DONE!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1616587000/jbjj0bsbytrdtlllw2dz.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We have many of the standard perks (producer credits, DVD/Blu-Ray's, T-Shirts, posters) but we have some cool ones:</p>
<ul>
<li>Props from the movie (most of those have already sold out)</li>
<li>MP3 of the opening theme ""Cruisin'"" by Andrew Stainer (a stretch goal offering)</li>
<li>Signed instant pictures by the cast while they are on the set</li>
<li>Personalized video messages from the cast</li>
<li>Having your name mentioned</li>
<li>and so much more!</li>
</ul>
<p>If we don't make our $13,000 goal, we will make as much of the movie we can with what we have to show what we can do with the funding we receive. The cinematographer and the gaffer get paid first, then the actors, then the rest of the crew. We would rather not have to do a second campaign or rely on a distribution deal to pay everyone. This movie will be made, no matter if we have to do it a little at a time.</p>

<h3>What this means to us</h3>
</div><div>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, this film is intended to be a showcase of the vast talent in the DC, Maryland, and Virginia area (what we call the DMV) and even as far as Texas. By donating to this funding campaign, you will directly support the entrepreneurial spirit of so many independent film makers and actors. This a dream project, and we have assembled people who love this script and the concept.</p>
<p>In the first year of our existence, Key 13 Film Partners completed a wide variety of projects. We produced and released the award winning short film ""Hoodie"". We did a music video, worked on a comic book fan project, and even made a commercial. We also supported our local film community by supporting the movies ""Remnants"" and ""Brazen Impact"" for Absurd Production Pictures.  While we did have some setbacks, we continued to move forward and do our best to achieve our goals. We don't buckle under pressure.</p>

<h3>Success is not guaranteed </h3>
<p>As with anything different, there are risks, and we know that we have a lot of work ahead of us. Finding the right people and places to film was our first big hurdle, and we managed to clear it. Next is convincing people to invest in something that isn't typical for this area. A crime film about two mobsters going about their day (ala Pulp Fiction) is a tough sell. We know we have a great script and an awesome cast and crew, so the next step is being able to bring everyone together.

<h2><strong>The Mission:</strong></h2>
<p>My goal with making this film is to reimagine and reintroduce the Vietnam conflict and get a glimpse into the kinds of stories that were swept under the rug, so to speak. I feel the conflict draws a lot of parallels to the Anti Asian Violence we see in the U.S. today, and the themes of the story speak to that. We have very little seen portrayals of the Vietnam War from a Vietnamese American perspective, and considering what we've seen in the Asian American Community over the past year, it's high time we do so. </p>
<h3><strong>The Story: </strong></h3>
<p>In North Vietnam in 1970, U.S. Army Private Daniel Jennings befriends a young Vietnamese boy, Xuan. But when his platoon returns to his camp, the dangers of that friendship become apparent, and an innocent and playful relationship soon becomes a tense conflict of life or death.</p>

<p>All in all, we need <strong><u>$10,000</u></strong> to make this short film the best it can be. By donating, not only will you helping film students of all backgrounds advance their career and education, but you will be supporting a story meant to inspire change and reflection, not to mention the artistic perspective of Asian Americans. </p>

<p>You already know about me, so this will be brief. I've Produced, Shot, Directed, and Edited a plethora of short films in the past, both outside and inside of my education, even working with other film schools like NYU Tisch. I've been involved in commercial projects, working with clients like Sonic and Dairy Queen, but that's enough about me. Let's get to the others. </p>

<p>A film student from Cincinnati, Ohio, Stone Taul is a gifted Photographer and Cinematographer. His experience shooting with film stock combined with his vintage, ominous aesthetic and visual style, pair exceptionally well with the themes and tones of this film. He's premiered a variety of his work at festivals from across the country, and accumulated a collection of awards doing so. </p>
<h3><strong><i>First Assistant Director:</i> Yasmine Torres</strong></h3>

<p>Having just recently graduated from film school, Yasmine is one of the most driven, determined, and indomitable people you will ever meet. Not only is she a talented filmmaker, but she has a proficiently high aptitude for organization, making her the perfect and most reliable 1st AD for this project. Not to mention, she is incredibly passionate about this film. With Yasmine behind scheduling and managing set operations day to day, the project is ensured to remain on track.</p>

<p>A film student from Although Joseann has no ancestral connection to Asian culture or heritage, he has an immense respect and admiration for it. It's evidently a part of his personal aesthetic. He may not look  very approachable in the photo above, but in reality, he's one of the warmest,  most positive and optimistic people I know. Much like Stone, his visual aesthetic tends to be dark, dramatic, and filmic - again, ideal for the themes of this film.

<p>Unrelated to the great soul R&amp;B singer of the 50s and 60s, Sam is not only talented behind the camera, but he knows more about light than God on the first day of creation. He's worked in Grip and Electric on a wide variety of both professional and student productions, and he has been a lead creative influence on a number of music videos. With Sam leading the lighting crew, we will be able to achieve that cinematic look that fully immerses the audience and speaks to the themes of the story. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>After a teenage girl's spiritual rebirth gives her the ability to see angels and demons, she finds romance and danger as she battles demons who have overrun her rural hometown. Based on the book, ""They Don't Cast Shadows"" by Bob Leone and produced by Inspireworks Productions.</p>
<p>We need your help to back this unique Christian, Romance, Fantasy film. The Christian version of the ""Twilight"" series. </p>
<h3>About the Producers</h3>
<p>Melissa Goad, director of 'They Don't Cast Shadows' is a SAG actor, producer, screenwriter and director.  She has been acting professionally since the age of 12 and has starred in many indie feature films. Melissa understands what it takes to get the performance out of the actor to accomplish the feel and mood of the scene. She is a hard worker, dedicated and loyal to her work and those around her. </p>
<p>Bob Leone is the author of the Shadow Series books.  He is a purple heart veteran, author, writer, cartoonist, widower and father of 5.  Bob loves to share the truth of Jesus with anyone he comes in contact with which is why he is so excited that his first book is being turned into a feature film. </p>
<p>Bob and Melissa met at church.  One afternoon, about a year ago, Bob gave Melissa his first book and asked her to read it. After reading, Melissa told Bob she could see his book being turned into a film. Six months later, Bob and Melissa decided to make that dream a reality. They created Inspireworks Productions and then produced their first teaser trailer for 'They Don't Cast Shadows' to raise funds to film the feature in July 2021 in Georgetown, CA.  Their goal is to glorify God, to reach those who haven't heard of Jesus, who might not normally come to church or watch a Christian film. </p>
<p>For those who do not know Bob and Melissa, Bob is a doer! You ask him to do something, even mention it and he's already started implementing your idea. Melissa has a heart and passion for film and they both have a heart for the Lord. Bob and Melissa are the perfect team, they balance each other out and they both have different strengths which makes for a beautiful partnership. Once they decided to make Bob's book into a feature film, it took them less than 4 months to create a production company, write the teaser trailer script, hire an incredible crew, cast the film and then film the project. They are dedicated and they follow through. </p>
<h3>Funding</h3>
<p>This is a SAG feature film, meaning SAG rates will increase the budget. It will run closer to 110 minutes. We currently have $80,000 to start our feature film, however, with the amount of special effects, flying angels and demons (their makeup and costumes), large cast and crew and multiple locations, in order to accomplish a believable ""Hollywood"" type film that will reach millions, it needs to be done right. We could accomplish this film on a $250k level, but it would be more believable on a $500k budget.  Either way, we're starting production July 2021 with the goal in mind to bring more people to Jesus. </p>
<p>A $250K budget means no flying angels or demons and no big special effects.  We have to cut down the number of cast and crew.  </p>
<p>With a $500K budget we can have flying angels and demons, great special effects, a green screen if needed and custom set pieces. </p>
<p>We are planning on showing and pitching our project to the bigger Christian networks such as Pure Flix, Affirm Films, Christian Cinema, Fox Faith and more. </p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Christian films have skyrocketed during this last year, people are looking for something greater than themselves.  According to the CBN*, ""major movies released theatrically in the United States shows that movies with very strong Christian worldviews do much better at the box office than movies with Non-Christian worldviews"".  Since 2014, films produced and distributed by Pure Flix** have collectively grossed over $195 million at the worldwide box office.</p>

As he began to open up to me about his personal life and ministry, I felt connected to him even more. It was clear to me that he was passionate about his desire to lead people to Christ. As I continued to listen, the story got even better as he began sharing stories about his brother Mario (just think Joe Pesci meets Jack Black). Mario was the older brother that Carman looked up to, but he found himself in some pinches from time to time when Mario exercised authority he didn't really have. On the streets of New Jersey one day after an encounter with a bully, Mario taught Carman how to stand up for himself. It follows that he would later become Carman's tour bodyguard. Mario fired people he didn't have any authority over and overstepped boundaries at times, yet everyone who knew him found him endearing and hilarious. It was clear to me from listening to Carman's stories that Mario was a huge part of his life story. He never really got over Mario's death in 2000.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1627063470/dkunwh8fy0itziwu16ye.png"" src=""""/></p><p>Carman quickly became my friend, and over the course of the next eight months, we started planning a feature film about his life. It had become clear that this was not the typical ""Christian"" film. At one point I said, ""I'm not sure if we can make a movie that's part 'I Can Only Imagine' and part 'Goodfellas'. We laughed about that, but the truth is this: Carman's story is really about a guy who was the least likely to achieve this platform where millions of people would come to know Christ as their Savior. Many people considered him the Billy Graham of Christian music. To some, he was more like the Elvis of the genre. He led millions to the Lord, and this truly was his only passion.</p><p>By helping us tell Carman's full story, we believe you will be not only entertained, but essentially responsible for bringing millions more to Christ. This is not a documentary. This is a narrative, scripted film that will be based entirely on Carman's own words, with funny and heart-wrenching stories about his childhood and family life, going all the way through his music ministry and career.</p><p> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1627064437/kqqdvsrkcqtoyfkoqszw.png"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><h2><strong>PRODUCER BACKGROUND:</strong></h2><p>I'm Jack Vale, and I have been in the entertainment industry for 13 years. Starting on YouTube in 2007, I have produced and starred in TV shows and films, and recently created a show with an academy award-winning director which was sold to Fox. I currently have another feature film in pre-production which is being shot in February and March, 2022. My social media platforms have a combined following of 5 million fans, and over the years, my family-friendly comedy videos have been viewed 10 billion times on YouTube and Facebook.</p><p>I have always felt God gave me this platform because it was a conduit to reach people for Jesus. You see, when I was 15, I had a rather unique experience: one night after a concert, I spent half an hour alone in a room with my favorite Christian music artist: Carman. He was at the top of his career, doing the Radically Saved tour, but he took time to sit with a teenager with questions. That time, mostly I talked and he listened. He prayed with me. That night, his words changed my life. The fact that I met him again (this time as a 47-year-old film producer) and became his friend was no accident. It was ordained by God, and Carman and I both knew that. We began to work consistently on this project together, discussing the storyline, potential cast members, and music. I made it clear to him that my goal was the same as his: reaching more people for Jesus. I found out early on that there was nothing more important to him than that. </p><p>One of my last meetings with him was November 24th, 2020. He showed up with a giant poster-board and various colored markers, so that he and I could map out his life story for the film. I was completely blown away by his stories. Not only were they some of the most entertaining stories I had ever heard, but many were touching and frankly, life changing. I had never met anyone who was more focused on the end result being ""souls saved"". When I had an idea for something, his main focus was ""How will this contribute to leading people to the Lord?"" He said to me several times, ""If it doesn't bring more people to Christ, then what's the point?""</p><p>On February 16th, 2021, I received the most unexpected, devastating news: Carman had passed away after complications from surgery. My friend, who was so full of life and energy, was gone. I realize that eight months is not a long time to get to know someone, but we had spent hours together planning this movie, sharing stories, and putting all the pieces in place. This film was the most important thing to him, and I promised him several times that I would see it through. Even today, as I am still grieving the loss of Carman, I can hear his voice motivating and encouraging me to move this forward. He wanted things done yesterday, because ""The people might not be here tomorrow"".</p><h2><strong>THE MUSIC:</strong></h2><p>I called Carman several months ago to tell him that legendary record producer Rodney Jerkins was a fan of his, and he'd told me he would love to be involved in the music for this film. Carman had followed Rodney's career and was thrilled with the news. Rodney's involvement in production will be in the scoring for the movie and also in producing an all-star artist tribute album to Carman with re-imagined songs of some of his biggest CCM hits. Over the years, Rodney has produced for Michael Jackson, Mariah Carey, Whitney Houston, Kelly Clarkson, Justin Bieber, Mary J. Blige, Kanye West &amp; many others. He has had multiple Grammy nominations and two wins!</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1627174568/slvrkn4fwbj3bqsosoci.png"" src=""""/></p><p>I know Rodney, and can tell you that this man has a heart for God. Aside from his extensive accomplishments, he is a loving and committed husband and father. Rodney is excited to be a part of our project to bring honor to Carman's legacy and contribute by creating a soundtrack that Carman would be very proud of.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1627174593/v7e34knwfe31jqqicfco.png"" src=""""/></p><h2><strong>SCRIPT &amp; PRODUCTION:</strong></h2><p>Carman and I carefully considered some accomplished screenwriters, directors, and additional producers who we felt would do a great job bringing his story to the big screen. I am happy to say that we have made some of these decisions. The writers are very familiar with Carman's ministry and music business all the way through his life. And here's the <strong>BIG NEWS</strong>: The script is <strong>FINISHED!</strong> We even have the shooting schedule and plan to be filming <u>SUMMER of '22!</u></p><p>We cannot yet divulge who this next person is but we are in talks with an Academy Award-winning director to join us as an executive producer. As we get new information, we will be updating you. Gathering the team and crew is something that we largely have done already, but as I'm sure you can imagine, it is a process and we are SO EXCITED about the level of interest from some of the most accomplished movie industry professionals!</p><h2><strong>CAST and CREW:</strong></h2><p>The obvious elephant in the room is... ""WHO'S GOING TO PLAY CARMAN?"" Well, we will need three actors to cover various ages. We knew we needed someone very special to play him for the majority of the film and decided to do a nationwide casting call for this Italian Stallion.

As he began to open up to me about his personal life and ministry, I felt connected to him even more. It was clear to me that he was passionate about his desire to lead people to Christ. As I continued to listen, the story got even better as he began sharing stories about his brother Mario (just think Joe Pesci meets Jack Black). Mario was the older brother that Carman looked up to, but he found himself in some pinches from time to time when Mario exercised authority he didn't really have. On the streets of New Jersey one day after an encounter with a bully, Mario taught Carman how to stand up for himself. It follows that he would later become Carman's tour bodyguard. Mario fired people he didn't have any authority over and overstepped boundaries at times, yet everyone who knew him found him endearing and hilarious. It was clear to me from listening to Carman's stories that Mario was a huge part of his life story. He never really got over Mario's death in 2000.Carman quickly became my friend, and over the course of the next eight months, we started planning a feature film about his life. It had become clear that this was not the typical ""Christian"" film. At one point I said, ""I'm not sure if we can make a movie that's part 'I Can Only Imagine' and part 'Goodfellas'. We laughed about that, but the truth is this: Carman's story is really about a guy who was the least likely to achieve this platform where millions of people would come to know Christ as their Savior. Many people considered him the Billy Graham of Christian music. To some, he was more like the Elvis of the genre. He led millions to the Lord, and this truly was his only passion.By helping us tell Carman's full story, we believe you will be not only entertained, but essentially responsible for bringing millions more to Christ. This is not a documentary. This is a narrative, scripted film that will be based entirely on Carman's own words, with funny and heart-wrenching stories about his childhood and family life, going all the way through his music ministry and career.  PRODUCER BACKGROUND:I'm Jack Vale, and I have been in the entertainment industry for 13 years. Starting on YouTube in 2007, I have produced and starred in TV shows and films, and recently created a show with an academy award-winning director which was sold to Fox. I currently have another feature film in pre-production which is being shot in February and March, 2022. My social media platforms have a combined following of 5 million fans, and over the years, my family-friendly comedy videos have been viewed 10 billion times on YouTube and Facebook.I have always felt God gave me this platform because it was a conduit to reach people for Jesus. You see, when I was 15, I had a rather unique experience: one night after a concert, I spent half an hour alone in a room with my favorite Christian music artist: Carman. He was at the top of his career, doing the Radically Saved tour, but he took time to sit with a teenager with questions. That time, mostly I talked and he listened. He prayed with me. That night, his words changed my life. The fact that I met him again (this time as a 47-year-old film producer) and became his friend was no accident. It was ordained by God, and Carman and I both knew that. We began to work consistently on this project together, discussing the storyline, potential cast members, and music. I made it clear to him that my goal was the same as his: reaching more people for Jesus. I found out early on that there was nothing more important to him than that. One of my last meetings with him was November 24th, 2020. He showed up with a giant poster-board and various colored markers, so that he and I could map out his life story for the film. I was completely blown away by his stories. Not only were they some of the most entertaining stories I had ever heard, but many were touching and frankly, life changing. I had never met anyone who was more focused on the end result being ""souls saved"". When I had an idea for something, his main focus was ""How will this contribute to leading people to the Lord?"" He said to me several times, ""If it doesn't bring more people to Christ, then what's the point?""On February 16th, 2021, I received the most unexpected, devastating news: Carman had passed away after complications from surgery. My friend, who was so full of life and energy, was gone. I realize that eight months is not a long time to get to know someone, but we had spent hours together planning this movie, sharing stories, and putting all the pieces in place. This film was the most important thing to him, and I promised him several times that I would see it through. Even today, as I am still grieving the loss of Carman, I can hear his voice motivating and encouraging me to move this forward. He wanted things done yesterday, because ""The people might not be here tomorrow"".THE MUSIC:I called Carman several months ago to tell him that legendary record producer Rodney Jerkins was a fan of his, and he'd told me he would love to be involved in the music for this film. Carman had followed Rodney's career and was thrilled with the news. Rodney's involvement in production will be in the scoring for the movie and also in producing an all-star artist tribute album to Carman with re-imagined songs of some of his biggest CCM hits. Over the years, Rodney has produced for Michael Jackson, Mariah Carey, Whitney Houston, Kelly Clarkson, Justin Bieber, Mary J. Blige, Kanye West & many others. He has had multiple Grammy nominations and two wins!I know Rodney, and can tell you that this man has a heart for God. Aside from his extensive accomplishments, he is a loving and committed husband and father. Rodney is excited to be a part of our project to bring honor to Carman's legacy and contribute by creating a soundtrack that Carman would be very proud of.SCRIPT & PRODUCTION:Carman and I carefully considered some accomplished screenwriters, directors, and additional producers who we felt would do a great job bringing his story to the big screen. I am happy to say that we have made some of these decisions. The writers are very familiar with Carman's ministry and music business all the way through his life. And here's the BIG NEWS: The script is FINISHED! We even have the shooting schedule and plan to be filming SUMMER of '22!We cannot yet divulge who this next person is but we are in talks with an Academy Award-winning director to join us as an executive producer. As we get new information, we will be updating you. Gathering the team and crew is something that we largely have done already, but as I'm sure you can imagine, it is a process and we are SO EXCITED about the level of interest from some of the most accomplished movie industry professionals!CAST and CREW:The obvious elephant in the room is... ""WHO'S GOING TO PLAY CARMAN?"" Well, we will need three actors to cover various ages. We knew we needed someone very special to play him for the majority of the film and decided to do a nationwide casting call for this Italian Stallion. We do have someone in mind to play his older brother Mario, and all I can tell you is that you have seen him a lot! When I called Carman to tell him, he shouted his name and said, ""I THINK HE COULD PULL IT OFF!"" We did have discussions about the rest of the cast, and since this largely has to do with coordinating shooting schedules with theirs, we will be flexible while only hiring top-tier talent. We will update you as these decisions are made. Experienced crew members are being rounded up as we speak, and we plan to shoot in New Jersey and Tennessee.",7.0,1,"1 Campaign

<p>My rescue dog, Leo (aka Lord Leopold) and I, would like to thank you for stopping by and finding out more about our effort to make a difference for strays! Even reading this is a huge step towards our goal of raising awareness and spreading the word.</p>
<p>We all have a list of things we're passionate about. On the top of my list are films and dogs. So, making a film about dog rescue just came naturally. I have been making films for a living, while also helping out in shelters for more than a decade, and the results so far have been nothing but rewarding. Several films I've worked on have been awarded in international festivals (check out IMDb for details, <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3408378"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3408378</a>), while some have been distributed to millions of households around the globe.</p>
<p>Yet, looking into the grateful eyes of a rescued dog is worth more than any award in the world! And that is why I want to make this film - to explain how the problem arises, celebrate the incredible work of volunteers out there and inspire more people to make a difference, any way they can: either by looking after their pets more responsibly, or by rescuing, or by supporting those who rescue, or simply by spreading the word (it helps!).</p>
<p>No matter who you are, where you come from, or what you do for a living, becoming a superhero for a cause takes nothing more than finding what you believe in and doing what you can to make a difference. I've found my calling, and would like you to come with me on this unforgettable journey. </p>

<p>This has been my passion project for several years, with footage dating from as early as 2014 and with all expenses covered by myself, with the kind generosity of fellow film-makers (who either worked voluntarily or with discounted fees), friends and family. With their help, I have so far filmed extensively with selected volunteers from Cyprus, Romania and the U.K. We are pretty much half-way through filming.</p>
<p>But there's much more that needs to be done before the film can be released:</p>
<ul>
<li>Traveling to Florida, U.S.A. to film our featured volunteer and her shelter</li>
<li>Traveling to Crete, Greece, to film our feature volunteer and his shelter</li>
<li>Proceeding with an assembly edit, to establish any need for additional filming</li>
<li>Complementary filming (if required)</li>
<li>Post-production: Final editing, color grading, sound design, music scoring, up-scaling etc.</li>
<li>Promotion and distribution to festivals (spreading the word as widely as possible is why we do this!)</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, completing this film requires that the expenses of traveling, accommodation, filming, insurance, post-production and distribution are covered. And for these, your much appreciated contribution, no matter how small, would make a huge difference towards realizing our goal.</p>

<p>FISH &amp; MEN is the most ambitious documentary film to tell the story of how the globalized seafood industry impacts all of us - including our public health. We've been working on this film since 2013 to make an epic story of the American fisherman and how we view seafood.</p>
<p>After our successful Kickstarter campaign and some generous support, the project has been self-funded by the two co-directors who each risked their personal savings to get here.</p>
<p>We've captured amazing personal stories of fishermen - the heart of our story - along with inspiring entrepreneurs, authors and some of the most celebrated chefs in the world. </p>
<p>We are now at the most critical point in post-production where we need funding to help get this film to the finish line so that we can premiere in October or November 2019!  </p>

 Know Where Your Seafood Comes From

America has more coastline and fishing grounds than any other country in the world. The bounty of healthy fish that could be sustainably harvested in the United States is more than enough to feed us, yet lesser known species have little market appeal to consumers.

A new movement is underway – a sustainable opportunity for both fish and fishermen.

Thriving on local communities, pioneering fishermen and chefs are working together to build a revolutionary new model - a ‘Catch of the Day’ revival where supply trumps demand. 

Chefs are introducing consumers to discover new varieties of sustainable and storied seafood.

School lunch programs are sourcing fresh, local fish to provide healthy seafood to students.

While programs like Dock to Dish are reconnecting us to those who harvest from the sea. 

The future of fishermen and our access to healthy, sustainable seafood begins now with you.

The first step is directing this short film version of <i>Sissy</i> to communicate my vision for the feature. </p><p>While the short film shares characters, themes and dilemmas with the feature film, it's not pulled directly from the feature script.  This short film version of <i>Sissy</i> will stand alone as its own complete story. </p><p><strong>It's a scene between the sisters in a psychiatric hospital, after Elizabeth has found Mary homeless in a Denver winter, disheveled and disoriented.  Can Elizabeth even help Mary at this point, or is she too far gone?  Does Mary even want her help?  Should Elizabeth decide to become Mary's legal guardian since her parents won't?  Or maybe she should do it for other reasons?  There are no easy answers as two women navigate their unusual relationship and try to understand their past and decide their future.  </strong></p><p>Our team has connections to top industry talent and producers who can ensure <i>Sissy</i>, the feature film, will get made and be seen by audiences worldwide.  The script is ready.  Our pitch is ready.  The only hitch in the plan is that Shannon has yet to formally direct anything on film.  Our main objective with this short film version of <i>Sissy</i> is to show those A-listers that Shannon has a compelling vision and is the right person to bring the larger story to life.  Your support will help Shannon take the next leap toward becoming the storyteller she's always longed to be and ensure the feature film is made with her at the helm.  In addition, we will be submitting the short to festivals and seeking distribution so people all over the world can enjoy this short film that you helped to create.  </p><h2>

Scenes from Elizabeth's past will be shot on 16mm film, conveying her nostalgic longing to reclaim her childhood.</p><p>Our filmmaking process will allow for long takes and improvisation so the actresses can fully inhabit each moment.  Together we will make certain both women are flawed, relatable humans whose choices will build to an emotional climax and inconvenient, unexpected, yet hopeful resolution.  <i>Sissy</i> will leave the audience in an ethical bind, wrestling with the limits and responsibilities of this unusual relationship.  </p><p>We expect pre-production to begin starting February of 2021.  We will shoot over a three day period in mid-March.  Post-production will commence immediately after production ends and last for 2-3 months.  The film is expected to be completed in early June 2021.</p><h2>Why Invest in SISSY?</h2><p><i>Sissy</i> is a female driven, suspenseful, family drama that will appeal especially to mothers, daughters, and sisters 25+.  Elizabeth's struggle to balance her responsibilities to family with her personal ambition is a relatable and contemporary issue facing many women.  The film will also be directly relatable to disabled individuals and their families.  This community is underrepresented in film.  According to the CDC, in the United States about 17% of children aged 3-17 years have one or more developmental disabilities.  <i>Sissy</i> deals with struggles that face this community, including mental health, homelessness, and inadequate healthcare, at a moment in time when culture is hotly debating these issues.  By casting Mary from the community of disabled actors and by receiving script consultation from Christine Bruno, as well as Shannon's sister Erin, <i>Sissy</i> will be inclusive of individuals who have been historically overlooked in both subject matter and execution. </p><p>Even with difficult subject matter,<i> Sissy</i> is uplifting.  It inspires us to face our unresolved past and reminds us that love can heal any wound.   </p><h2>Comparable Films</h2><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1610055471/uvrdqkjgy5p2lxw99kzf.png"" src=""""/></p><h2><strong>What We Need and Why We Need It</strong></h2><p>We need to raise financing to pay for <strong>production</strong> and <strong>post production</strong> costs like: </p><ul>

The first step is directing this short film version of Sissy to communicate my vision for the feature. While the short film shares characters, themes and dilemmas with the feature film, it's not pulled directly from the feature script.  This short film version of Sissy will stand alone as its own complete story. It's a scene between the sisters in a psychiatric hospital, after Elizabeth has found Mary homeless in a Denver winter, disheveled and disoriented.  Can Elizabeth even help Mary at this point, or is she too far gone?  Does Mary even want her help?  Should Elizabeth decide to become Mary's legal guardian since her parents won't?  Or maybe she should do it for other reasons?  There are no easy answers as two women navigate their unusual relationship and try to understand their past and decide their future.  Our team has connections to top industry talent and producers who can ensure Sissy, the feature film, will get made and be seen by audiences worldwide.  The script is ready.  Our pitch is ready.  The only hitch in the plan is that Shannon has yet to formally direct anything on film.  Our main objective with this short film version of Sissy is to show those A-listers that Shannon has a compelling vision and is the right person to bring the larger story to life.  Your support will help Shannon take the next leap toward becoming the storyteller she's always longed to be and ensure the feature film is made with her at the helm.  In addition, we will be submitting the short to festivals and seeking distribution so people all over the world can enjoy this short film that you helped to create.  
The Team Shannon received her B.A. in theater from the University of Southern California in 2002 and has been working as an actress ever since.  Along with producing partners Charlie Hofheimer and Derin Turner, she founded the production company Filament Features in 2009.  With Filament, she has produced and co-written numerous projects, including viral music videos, award and competition winning short films, and worldwide distributed feature films.  In addition to Sissy, she has written two other feature films, To Be With You and Into the Dark, and co-written two others, Freed and Followers.Charlie’s first producing venture, Against the Current, starred Joseph Fiennes and Mary Tyler Moore and world premiered at Sundance 2009.   Shortly thereafter, Charlie started Filament Features to produce projects across the media spectrum.  Filament has completed thirty-two short format productions and partnered on four feature length films.  Charlie has directed two short films, Baggage and Home.  In addition to Sissy, Charlie is currently developing the independent feature Followers, which he will direct.  Charlie has been a professional actor for thirty years and has worked on projects of all scales, including over a dozen independent feature films of similar scope to Sissy.  Berman Fenelus is an award winning Producer/Director based in New York City with 20 years of professional experience.  He has made it his mission to create and produce unique, visually stimulating stories about diverse communities that mainstream Hollywood tends to neglect.  He is currently Senior Content Producer at understood.org.  He has directed and shot for Maybelline, Adidas X FinishLine, Tide, Toyota, and McDonalds.  In 2020, Berman won an Emmy for directing Spell It Out, a PSA about food allergies.  Through his production company All Area Crew, he has also produced award-winning short films and documentaries including Kojo, LANA, and SELFie.Creative VisionSissy explores themes of family and self-realization as Elizabeth and Mary begin to overcome their traumas by facing each other.  We will experience this story through Elizabeth's eyes.  The movie will often assume her first person perspective, and the camera will be handheld, communicating her tumultuous inner state and the uncertainty of her journey. The look of the film will be cold, grimy, and sometimes gruesome.  Low-key lighting will reflect Elizabeth's psychology.  Muted colors with a blue undertone will pervade, except in flashback scenes between the sisters, where warmer, more saturated tones will communicate Elizabeth and Mary's bond and the hope therein. Scenes from Elizabeth's past will be shot on 16mm film, conveying her nostalgic longing to reclaim her childhood.Our filmmaking process will allow for long takes and improvisation so the actresses can fully inhabit each moment.  Together we will make certain both women are flawed, relatable humans whose choices will build to an emotional climax and inconvenient, unexpected, yet hopeful resolution.  Sissy will leave the audience in an ethical bind, wrestling with the limits and responsibilities of this unusual relationship.  We expect pre-production to begin starting February of 2021.  We will shoot over a three day period in mid-March.  Post-production will commence immediately after production ends and last for 2-3 months.  The film is expected to be completed in early June 2021.Why Invest in SISSY?Sissy is a female driven, suspenseful, family drama that will appeal especially to mothers, daughters, and sisters 25+.  Elizabeth's struggle to balance her responsibilities to family with her personal ambition is a relatable and contemporary issue facing many women.  The film will also be directly relatable to disabled individuals and their families.  This community is underrepresented in film.  According to the CDC, in the United States about 17% of children aged 3-17 years have one or more developmental disabilities.  Sissy deals with struggles that face this community, including mental health, homelessness, and inadequate healthcare, at a moment in time when culture is hotly debating these issues.  By casting Mary from the community of disabled actors and by receiving script consultation from Christine Bruno, as well as Shannon's sister Erin, Sissy will be inclusive of individuals who have been historically overlooked in both subject matter and execution. Even with difficult subject matter, Sissy is uplifting.  It inspires us to face our unresolved past and reminds us that love can heal any wound.   Comparable FilmsWhat We Need and Why We Need ItWe need to raise financing to pay for production and post production costs like: 
paying the cast and crew and contributing to their various union pension and health plans 
transporting and housing some cast and crew members
feeding the cast and crew 
location rental
equipment rental

general liability and worker's compensation insurance
Also, a sizable portion of the budget is going toward complying with covid-19 regulations, including quarantining certain cast members who will travel for the production, testing all cast and crew prior to filming, providing PPE while working, and hiring a dedicated Covid Compliance Officer who's sole job is to ensure the production adheres to our unions' Zone system, protocols designed to keep everyone on set safe from the spread of covid-19.  Shannon and Charlie are not taking a penny from the capital raised.  Every dollar will exclusively fund the filming and completion of the project.     What You Get for Your ContributionWe don't imagine you're considering contributing to this project because you want a mug or a t-shirt.  Our guess is you want to be a piece of the puzzle and help complete the picture.  So our perks are all about including you in the experience of making Sissy and bringing you into our filmmaking process. In addition to social media shout outs or a credit in the Special Thank You section of the credits, you can get:

<h3>WHAT IS MONTAUK77?</h3>
<p>The simple answer...MONTAUK77 is a feature film written by Michael Scully and his daughter, Michayla. Now in pre-production, MONTAUK77 is scheduled to begin shooting in March of 2021.</p>
<p>The REAL answer...MONTAUK77 is a <i>passion project</i> of filmmaker, Michael Scully of Island Long Productions. Serving as writer, director and performer on the film, Michael's 20+ years of experience in writing, directing, and editing short films, music videos, television commercials, corporate &amp; other promotional videos, etc. has ALL LED TO THIS...his FIRST FEATURE FILM.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>WHAT IS THE FILM ABOUT?</h3>
<p>MONTAUK77 tells the story of Harry, a middle aged, ""down on his luck"" rideshare driver whose day begins like any other. That is, until he meets his next passenger, a snarky, fifteen year old girl named Liz who hires Harry to drive her out to the beaches at Montauk Point, Long Island for the purposes of laying her late mother's remains to rest.</p>
<p>Little does Harry know, at the end of their day's long journey, his young passenger has an ulterior motive. Realizing her driver's questionable past, Liz intends to recruit Harry's help and ask him to pull off a risky bank heist...prompting Harry to question whether their meeting was by chance, or perhaps, destiny.</p>
<p>Mixing light drama with a bit of comedy, this road trip (turned bank heist) film also serves as story about coping with loss and seeking forgiveness...particularly from oneself. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>WHAT IS THE FILM'S INTENT?</h3>
<p>We intend MONTAUK77 to make its way to the film festival circuit as early as summer 2021 where we will seek distribution on either an ""ON DEMAND"" platform (ie: NETFLIX, AMAZON, etc.) or as a theatrical release.</p>

Student Affairs. An outlandish bold high energy Sitcom dedicated to highlighting the real shit young people go through every day.

Strong-willed, and sociable.  On the quiet side and a bit reserved, but not to a point where he’s awkward.  Very passive, few things go his way.  An unheard voice of reason in his friend group.  Typically sucked into dealing with other people’s problems.  Sometimes he lets his emotions get the best of him, which leads him to more trouble. Also, he’s gay but that doesn’t define his personality.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Britney</strong>: Female, Very self-centered, and loud. Will usually do things that are to her benefit. She's either zero or one hundred, there’s not much room for a middle ground with her. She is pushy. A loyal friend who will do anything for the people she likes to tolerate, even if it’s the wrong course of action. In her mind, she is always right.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Jordyn</strong>: Female, Roommate, Wild and wacky. Chaotic energy all the time. Obsessed with her long-distance boyfriend (Will Fredo) She has no filter and is extremely spontaneous. She’s secretly really smart but you would never know because she’s always on her phone. She always has a comment, even if it’s not relevant.  </p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Chase</strong>: Male, Roommate(?) And friend. Like if Creed from the Office was partly James Bond. Very accepting, even in the strangest situations. Chase is skillful, but definitely not the brightest bulb in the group. He will have spontaneous outbursts caused by saying: I’ve said too much. Chase prefers to be a mystery to his friend group. In his best-case scenario, he’s kinda just there.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Victoria</strong>: Female, The Pure one.  She is very inexperienced in life but is somehow able to handle herself around others. She may be the most normal out of all the group, but to her friends, she's the oddball. She can be a bit naive at times but is not dumb by any means. Her reactions are not as big as others around her. She is dependent on the group to have fun. In high school, she was the type of girl who did not go out because of the risks, but now that she’s in college, and she wants to go on a few adventures.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Cast</strong></h2><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1629921362/pwzievsdbfbkb1aebcdm.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h2 style=""text-align: center;"">What’s this pilot about?</h2><p style=""text-align: center;"">Our first full-length episode will consist of an A and B storyline Britney’s parents come into town, but she can’t stand them.  After Caster realizes he has no money, he devises a plan to be her buffer, this way, he gets a free meal.  Unfortunately, Britney leaves Caster alone with her parents and he discovers why she can’t stand them.

Student Affairs. An outlandish bold high energy Sitcom dedicated to highlighting the real shit young people go through every day. Follow 5 college friends, with manic personalities, who always end up dealing with each other’s selfish motives, and poor choices, all while maneuvering through their day-to-day lives. Tell me about the show The most entertaining aspects of college always take place outside of the university, but an entertaining experience doesn’t always mean a good one.  As Seinfeld grounded its humor in everyday situations for adults who make poor choices, Student Affairs seeks to find humor in everyday situations for young adults.CharactersCaster: Male. Strong-willed, and sociable.  On the quiet side and a bit reserved, but not to a point where he’s awkward.  Very passive, few things go his way.  An unheard voice of reason in his friend group.  Typically sucked into dealing with other people’s problems.  Sometimes he lets his emotions get the best of him, which leads him to more trouble. Also, he’s gay but that doesn’t define his personality. Britney: Female, Very self-centered, and loud. Will usually do things that are to her benefit. She's either zero or one hundred, there’s not much room for a middle ground with her. She is pushy. A loyal friend who will do anything for the people she likes to tolerate, even if it’s the wrong course of action. In her mind, she is always right. Jordyn: Female, Roommate, Wild and wacky. Chaotic energy all the time. Obsessed with her long-distance boyfriend (Will Fredo) She has no filter and is extremely spontaneous. She’s secretly really smart but you would never know because she’s always on her phone. She always has a comment, even if it’s not relevant.   Chase: Male, Roommate(?) And friend. Like if Creed from the Office was partly James Bond. Very accepting, even in the strangest situations. Chase is skillful, but definitely not the brightest bulb in the group. He will have spontaneous outbursts caused by saying: I’ve said too much. Chase prefers to be a mystery to his friend group. In his best-case scenario, he’s kinda just there. Victoria: Female, The Pure one.  She is very inexperienced in life but is somehow able to handle herself around others. She may be the most normal out of all the group, but to her friends, she's the oddball. She can be a bit naive at times but is not dumb by any means. Her reactions are not as big as others around her. She is dependent on the group to have fun. In high school, she was the type of girl who did not go out because of the risks, but now that she’s in college, and she wants to go on a few adventures. CastWhat’s this pilot about?Our first full-length episode will consist of an A and B storyline Britney’s parents come into town, but she can’t stand them.  After Caster realizes he has no money, he devises a plan to be her buffer, this way, he gets a free meal.  Unfortunately, Britney leaves Caster alone with her parents and he discovers why she can’t stand them. Meanwhile, Chase, Jordyn, and Victoria feel left out and decide to have a fancy dinner of their own.  However, they’re poor college students and have limited options.  Chase warns them to prevent chaos from ensuing they’ll have to get food soon or he’s going to get: Hangary. Crew What’s the goal?Parents aren't always easy. Everyone knows someone who just doesn't understand what's ok to say, or even worse, does know but doesn't care. Whether it be your Dad saying those off-color remarks, or your mom who makes those assumptions based on stereotypes. Our goal with this episode is to bring light and humor to the relationships people have with difficult parents who claim to be too old to change with the world. Many shows today struggle to reach out to and capture a younger audience. This is because generational humor is just for that, the generation. And as we move forward into the next generation we understand how to utilize Defeatist, spontaneous, and reflective humor because we’ve lived through it. Our experiences allow us to relate to the up-and-coming adults. At the moment, certain issues overwhelm our thoughts, but in retrospect, these issues are always something to laugh about. Our generation struggles with letting go and laughing about it. We know it first hand. What our show gives others is that scapegoat for people our age to laugh about an embarrassing moment or that poor choice. Misery is comedy Budget! How’s it going to look?Our show will present a look that is bright, airy, and colorful, all while utilizing depressive real and dark humorous themes. The clashing of these two tones will enhance the comedy within each episode.   For the futureOf course, we have aspirations for this project. In the short term, we would love to submit this to festivals as well as continue pursuing our other episode ideas. The ultimate goal would be to pitch this show and become a series showcasing an under-represented audience, young people. THANK YOU",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

Funding for this campaign will go the 2 week shoot for these scenes and post-production costs (picture editing, sound effects editing, 5.1 sound mix, final deliverables for distributor, and DCP).
Also, perks will give fans one last chance to get their names in the credits of TERROR TOONS 4 and / or pre-order the ""Quadrilogy,"" ""Terror Toons 3"" or ""Terror Toons 4"" on DVD/Blu-Ray. The funding raised by this campaign will also cover the cost of printing and shipping the DVD/Blu-Ray.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Bamby Salcedo, a nationwide recognized undocumented transgender Latina human rights activist, celebrates her 50th birthday celebration which is attended by many important people, including 49 women significant to her life and survival. As she prepares for her birthday celebration, Bamby travels through Los Angeles county and watches her life go past; from the streets where she smoked crack and the Men’s County Jail where she was raped to journalists, academics and activists she has enlisted to her causes, plush homes of supporters, and communities and organizations she has gathered to change the life of transgender people across the United States. The film reveals the great story of strength and joyful celebration of life that is powered by acceptance of the most painful past experiences to make a real difference for others and oneself.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1592759433/evdckr5uxtnmeifenmqt.png"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>Story Summary</h3>
<p>Bamby Salcedo is turning 50 years old. For most people, a 50<sup>th</sup> birthday is a time of reflection. For Bamby, it is a moment to celebrate. In a society where transgender people face endemic violence, discrimination, and huge barriers to flourishing,as the life expectancy of a trans woman is 35 years,  survival to the age of 50 marks a real milestone. And Bamby is a true survivor: an HIV-positive, undocumented immigrant, victim of multiple sexual assaults, in recovery from drug addiction. Through her time as a sex worker and a life on the streets, she has emerged as one of the most nationally and internationally recognizable trans activists. She has won numerous community service awards, and earned a Master’s degree in Latin"" studies. Bamby is a force of nature and an inspiration to many.</p>
<p><i>LA QueenCiañera</i> follows Bamby as she prepares for her birthday celebration with characteristic activist energy: this event is not really about her, but rather a way to bring visibility and power to the populations she cares about:  trans folks, queer people, the homeless, incarcerated and the HIV positive. The party is a deliberate <i>queering</i> of a traditional Latinx ritual, a Quinceañera, in which a 15-year-old girl is “presented” to society as a young woman, typically by a family patriarch. Bamby’s party will have many of the trappings of the Quinceañera—decorations, Latin culture, music, and extravagant dresses—but without the patriarchal touches. In fact, this is a celebration of <i>matriarchy</i>, the 49 women who have been instrumental in Bamby’s survival and the ability to thrive. This celebration is one for the history books.</p>
<p>As she prepares for the big day, Bamby travels through Los Angeles, from the streets where she walked street corners and smoked crack, to journalists, activists and academics she has enlisted to her causes, to plush homes of supporters like Patricia Arquette and Rosario Dawson. Through this remarkable tour we see Bamby’s ability to connect with people, and join in a telling of her life story. She faces challenges from early on in life. Poverty is prevalent in her childhood in Mexico, a single mother working long hours. When her father leaves the family for the U.S., Bamby’s life becomes chaotic. She suffers psychological abuse from her mother and traumatic sexual abuse from her stepfather and as a teenager immigrates to the U.S. to re-unite with her birth father, who had formed a new family.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1592759846/al8lery2xl7gryoqohgk.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Bamby creates an alternative family in the city streets. She had struggling with her own trans identity since early childhood and now, surrounded by the anti-LGBT rhetoric of 1980s America, her life becomes fractured between school, gangs, and home. She embraces sex work, petty theft, drug abuse, and inevitable incarceration. After several visits to jails and prison, she discovers her positive HIV status, and begins a nihilist descent in hard drug addiction, sex work, and risky sexual encounters. Raw, revealing interviews with Bamby sketch this difficult personal history. After several close encounters with death, she admits herself to a rehabilitation center where she regains her state of mind and health.</p>
<p>Since the beginning her recovery journey at a treatment center, Bamby dedicates her life to helping others. In 2009 she founds the TransLatin@ Coalition, building visibility and a voice for the Trans Latinx community across the United States. Bamby also creates the nonprofit Angels of Change to address a severe lack of visibility and funding for the trans youth at children’s hospitals. As we explore the impact of these organizations and groups, we learn more about the severe hurdles faced by trans people everywhere—academics, journalists, activists, and community members explain the deep, structural barriers trans people face in their day-to-day lives.</p>
<p>We also follow Bamby through the byzantine immigration process. At one point, Bamby is scheduled for deportation, but her trans status earned her the protection of a “withholding of removal,” as the U.S. government recognized that returning Bamby to Mexico would be a likely death sentence. And, yet, ironically, as her immigration lawyer explains, that protected status also makes harder to establish her as a naturalized citizen. With her 50<sup>th</sup> approaching, Bamby tries to put an end to this years’ long legal battle, but it’s clear in the current political landscape of the U.S., her road to citizenship will be a long one.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1592760415/ys6blrfagprvszsibgcj.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>It’s finally time for the celebration. As Bamby’s friends and family gather and reminisce,<i> LA QueenCiañera</i> highlights the hardships and the lessons Bamby has learned and how they have shaped her and her extended, chosen family. Dancing, great food and music paint a portrait of a vibrant community of artists, activists and individuals who celebrate.Bamby has come through hell, and rather than turning her back on that grim past and hold the pain close.  Bamby has chosen to put out hands to help others trying to make it through. We see the joy and freedom of gender, ethnic and sexual identities, broken free from the toxic structures of the past—the essential, the binary, the oppressively simple and uncomplicated. In the end, <i>LA Queenciañera</i> celebrates a justice only possible with the acceptance of fluidity and choice. Through continuous work and bravely leading with her truest self, Bamby comes to personify this brand of trans-feminism that comes through the hard work of knowing oneself and helping others push through blind social barriers.</p>
<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Motivation</span></h3>
<p>I met Bamby in the Summer of 2017. I was preparing a film dealing with the relevance of Latinas in U.S. society and I wanted to include a transgender woman in it.</p>
<p>Bamby was just one of eight characters in the film, but we developed a special bond and mutual admiration. After the film was completed, we kept on collaborating and I told her I wanted to make a film exclusively about her. I found that life story very inspiring, especially since Bamby is such a kind person. “One among many,” you might say. But I would not expect someone who has been raped, who has been beaten and humiliated over and over, who has struggled with addiction and homelessness, to be a kind person. Yet Bamby has a special aura around her, she has special powers. That is a quality I want to capture in Bamby, and this <i>Queenciañera </i>event<i>—</i>sassy and celebratory, yet still transgressive and activist—was the perfect opportunity.</p>

<h3>Importance of the Campaign</h3>
<p>Before meeting Bamby, I thought that transgender people just wanted to perform cosmetic changes in their bodies such as the individuals who undertake a nose or boob job in order to look better. After getting to know Bamby deeply, I realized that this issue goes beyond an aesthetic lift, it also affects the psychology of the person who happens to have been born in the wrong body.</p>
<p>Through this documentary, we want people to treat transgender people with respect, understand their situation, end the discrimination and eradicate gender-based transgender crime.</p>
<p>We invested our own funds to start the film as we had to rush to shoot Bamby's birthday. If we want to continue making the film, we just need a small ""push"" from people like you. It'll be worth it.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Prior to the Covid-19 crisis, we attended the Berlin Film Festival with a teaser for the film and met with sales agents, distributors, and festivals. We had positive meetings with top tier festival programmers, who loved our topic, our main character, and the birthday celebration story. We expect the film to be finished in January 2021.</p>
<p>Particularly, we hope to make it to Berlinale and opt for the Teddy Award, aimed at films with LGBT topics. Our director is an alumni of the festival as he participated in the 2006 Berlinale Talents Scheme and had a feature documentary in the festival in 2017 as a producer.</p>
<ul><li><strong>Where it's going?</strong></li></ul>
<p>The amount received will be spent in the following items:</p>
<p>One of these festivals is Sundance. What filmmaker hasn't dreamt about going to Sundance? We are aware that Sundance acceptance rate for documentaries is around 2% but everyone in our team is a dreamer, so we want to make it happen. Therefore, we want to send the film to the festival, before the August deadline is over</p>
<ul><li><strong>How much funding do we need?</strong></li></ul>
<p>In order to keep the project going, 20,000 € (US$ 22,000), are needed. This amount will ideally cover a portion of our post-production. We would like to spend it in video editing, animations, music and sound editing and mixing as follows:</p>
<p><strong>- Animation 7,000 €</strong> <strong>(US$ 7,500):</strong> Animation is one of our tools for filling out the narrative and creating visual interest in the movie, so we will be hiring <i>Monografo Studio, </i>a high quality documentary animation studio best known for projects with <i> Netflix </i> or <i>Santander,</i> to recreate parts of Bamby's early years.</p>
<p><strong>- Video Editing 5,500 €</strong> <strong>(US$ 6,000):</strong> We will partially cover the salary of our editor, Nacho Ruiz Capillas.</p>
<p><strong>- Original Music 3,500 €</strong> <strong>(US$ 4,000): </strong>We will cover part of the salary of Antoni M. March, who will be composing an original score for the film,</p>
<p><strong>- Sound Editing and Mix 4,000 € (US$ 4,500): </strong>We will cover part of the costs of the sound works and the salary of our re-recording mixer.</p>

<h3>Impact &amp; Value of the Project</h3>
<p style=""margin-left:-7.1pt;"">We think that a part of society has become more tolerant and has embraced diversity but there’s another part which needs to be educated. We also hope that this film reaches them and helps them empathize.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:-7.1pt;"">Besides entertaining and informing, we also aim to raise awareness and hopefully make a change. English and Spanish languages coexist in the film and help it appeal to broader audiences, since the trans topic has a worldwide appeal. All her unexpected personal and academic triumphs, her bravery and immensity of humanity deliver us a message of motivation.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:-7.1pt;"">By making a contribution to our campaign, you'll be helping raise awareness for the trans community in order to integrate them into society so that they have the same opportunities.

<p style=""margin-left:-7.1pt;"">Our engagement and social impact campaigns will reach out to underserved trans and Trans Latinx communities in a variety of targeted ways. The film is intended to inspire new perspectives and actions regarding the quality of Latinx and all transgender people in the US.

</div></div>","Short Summary
Bamby Salcedo, a nationwide recognized undocumented transgender Latina human rights activist, celebrates her 50th birthday celebration which is attended by many important people, including 49 women significant to her life and survival. As she prepares for her birthday celebration, Bamby travels through Los Angeles county and watches her life go past; from the streets where she smoked crack and the Men’s County Jail where she was raped to journalists, academics and activists she has enlisted to her causes, plush homes of supporters, and communities and organizations she has gathered to change the life of transgender people across the United States. The film reveals the great story of strength and joyful celebration of life that is powered by acceptance of the most painful past experiences to make a real difference for others and oneself.

Story Summary
Bamby Salcedo is turning 50 years old. For most people, a 50th birthday is a time of reflection. For Bamby, it is a moment to celebrate. In a society where transgender people face endemic violence, discrimination, and huge barriers to flourishing,as the life expectancy of a trans woman is 35 years,  survival to the age of 50 marks a real milestone. And Bamby is a true survivor: an HIV-positive, undocumented immigrant, victim of multiple sexual assaults, in recovery from drug addiction. Through her time as a sex worker and a life on the streets, she has emerged as one of the most nationally and internationally recognizable trans activists. She has won numerous community service awards, and earned a Master’s degree in Latin"" studies. Bamby is a force of nature and an inspiration to many.
LA QueenCiañera follows Bamby as she prepares for her birthday celebration with characteristic activist energy: this event is not really about her, but rather a way to bring visibility and power to the populations she cares about:  trans folks, queer people, the homeless, incarcerated and the HIV positive. The party is a deliberate queering of a traditional Latinx ritual, a Quinceañera, in which a 15-year-old girl is “presented” to society as a young woman, typically by a family patriarch. Bamby’s party will have many of the trappings of the Quinceañera—decorations, Latin culture, music, and extravagant dresses—but without the patriarchal touches. In fact, this is a celebration of matriarchy, the 49 women who have been instrumental in Bamby’s survival and the ability to thrive. This celebration is one for the history books.
As she prepares for the big day, Bamby travels through Los Angeles, from the streets where she walked street corners and smoked crack, to journalists, activists and academics she has enlisted to her causes, to plush homes of supporters like Patricia Arquette and Rosario Dawson. Through this remarkable tour we see Bamby’s ability to connect with people, and join in a telling of her life story. She faces challenges from early on in life. Poverty is prevalent in her childhood in Mexico, a single mother working long hours. When her father leaves the family for the U.S., Bamby’s life becomes chaotic. She suffers psychological abuse from her mother and traumatic sexual abuse from her stepfather and as a teenager immigrates to the U.S. to re-unite with her birth father, who had formed a new family.

Bamby creates an alternative family in the city streets. She had struggling with her own trans identity since early childhood and now, surrounded by the anti-LGBT rhetoric of 1980s America, her life becomes fractured between school, gangs, and home. She embraces sex work, petty theft, drug abuse, and inevitable incarceration. After several visits to jails and prison, she discovers her positive HIV status, and begins a nihilist descent in hard drug addiction, sex work, and risky sexual encounters. Raw, revealing interviews with Bamby sketch this difficult personal history. After several close encounters with death, she admits herself to a rehabilitation center where she regains her state of mind and health.
Since the beginning her recovery journey at a treatment center, Bamby dedicates her life to helping others. In 2009 she founds the TransLatin@ Coalition, building visibility and a voice for the Trans Latinx community across the United States. Bamby also creates the nonprofit Angels of Change to address a severe lack of visibility and funding for the trans youth at children’s hospitals. As we explore the impact of these organizations and groups, we learn more about the severe hurdles faced by trans people everywhere—academics, journalists, activists, and community members explain the deep, structural barriers trans people face in their day-to-day lives.
We also follow Bamby through the byzantine immigration process. At one point, Bamby is scheduled for deportation, but her trans status earned her the protection of a “withholding of removal,” as the U.S. government recognized that returning Bamby to Mexico would be a likely death sentence. And, yet, ironically, as her immigration lawyer explains, that protected status also makes harder to establish her as a naturalized citizen. With her 50th approaching, Bamby tries to put an end to this years’ long legal battle, but it’s clear in the current political landscape of the U.S., her road to citizenship will be a long one.

It’s finally time for the celebration. As Bamby’s friends and family gather and reminisce, LA QueenCiañera highlights the hardships and the lessons Bamby has learned and how they have shaped her and her extended, chosen family. Dancing, great food and music paint a portrait of a vibrant community of artists, activists and individuals who celebrate.Bamby has come through hell, and rather than turning her back on that grim past and hold the pain close.  Bamby has chosen to put out hands to help others trying to make it through. We see the joy and freedom of gender, ethnic and sexual identities, broken free from the toxic structures of the past—the essential, the binary, the oppressively simple and uncomplicated. In the end, LA Queenciañera celebrates a justice only possible with the acceptance of fluidity and choice. Through continuous work and bravely leading with her truest self, Bamby comes to personify this brand of trans-feminism that comes through the hard work of knowing oneself and helping others push through blind social barriers.
Motivation
I met Bamby in the Summer of 2017. I was preparing a film dealing with the relevance of Latinas in U.S. society and I wanted to include a transgender woman in it.
Bamby was just one of eight characters in the film, but we developed a special bond and mutual admiration. After the film was completed, we kept on collaborating and I told her I wanted to make a film exclusively about her. I found that life story very inspiring, especially since Bamby is such a kind person. “One among many,” you might say. But I would not expect someone who has been raped, who has been beaten and humiliated over and over, who has struggled with addiction and homelessness, to be a kind person. Yet Bamby has a special aura around her, she has special powers. That is a quality I want to capture in Bamby, and this Queenciañera event—sassy and celebratory, yet still transgressive and activist—was the perfect opportunity.

Importance of the Campaign
Before meeting Bamby, I thought that transgender people just wanted to perform cosmetic changes in their bodies such as the individuals who undertake a nose or boob job in order to look better. After getting to know Bamby deeply, I realized that this issue goes beyond an aesthetic lift, it also affects the psychology of the person who happens to have been born in the wrong body.
Through this documentary, we want people to treat transgender people with respect, understand their situation, end the discrimination and eradicate gender-based transgender crime.
We invested our own funds to start the film as we had to rush to shoot Bamby's birthday. If we want to continue making the film, we just need a small ""push"" from people like you. It'll be worth it.


What We Need & What You Get
Prior to the Covid-19 crisis, we attended the Berlin Film Festival with a teaser for the film and met with sales agents, distributors, and festivals. We had positive meetings with top tier festival programmers, who loved our topic, our main character, and the birthday celebration story. We expect the film to be finished in January 2021.
Particularly, we hope to make it to Berlinale and opt for the Teddy Award, aimed at films with LGBT topics. Our director is an alumni of the festival as he participated in the 2006 Berlinale Talents Scheme and had a feature documentary in the festival in 2017 as a producer.
Where it's going?
The amount received will be spent in the following items:
One of these festivals is Sundance. What filmmaker hasn't dreamt about going to Sundance? We are aware that Sundance acceptance rate for documentaries is around 2% but everyone in our team is a dreamer, so we want to make it happen. Therefore, we want to send the film to the festival, before the August deadline is over
How much funding do we need?
In order to keep the project going, 20,000 € (US$ 22,000), are needed. This amount will ideally cover a portion of our post-production. We would like to spend it in video editing, animations, music and sound editing and mixing as follows:
- Animation 7,000 € (US$ 7,500): Animation is one of our tools for filling out the narrative and creating visual interest in the movie, so we will be hiring Monografo Studio, a high quality documentary animation studio best known for projects with  Netflix  or Santander, to recreate parts of Bamby's early years.
- Video Editing 5,500 € (US$ 6,000): We will partially cover the salary of our editor, Nacho Ruiz Capillas.
- Original Music 3,500 € (US$ 4,000): We will cover part of the salary of Antoni M. March, who will be composing an original score for the film,
- Sound Editing and Mix 4,000 € (US$ 4,500): We will cover part of the costs of the sound works and the salary of our re-recording mixer.

Our unique perks!
The Candle: leave your footprint.
The Paper Lantern: be one of the first to watch.
The Streamer: have your own QueenCiañera Party screening.
The Party Hat: try our Queen outfit.
The Music: want an autograph?
The Ice Cream: receive our famous ""Thank you Video"".
The Piñata: have dinner with us.
The Cake: be one of our VIP's.
The Present: become an Associate Producer.
The Birthday Girl/Boy: be our Exec Producer.
 

Impact & Value of the Project
We think that a part of society has become more tolerant and has embraced diversity but there’s another part which needs to be educated. We also hope that this film reaches them and helps them empathize.
Besides entertaining and informing, we also aim to raise awareness and hopefully make a change. English and Spanish languages coexist in the film and help it appeal to broader audiences, since the trans topic has a worldwide appeal. All her unexpected personal and academic triumphs, her bravery and immensity of humanity deliver us a message of motivation.
By making a contribution to our campaign, you'll be helping raise awareness for the trans community in order to integrate them into society so that they have the same opportunities. We believe making this documentary will be our contribution to making the world a better place. This inspiring personal-growth story has the potential to impact the audience in a compelling way.

Our engagement and social impact campaigns will reach out to underserved trans and Trans Latinx communities in a variety of targeted ways. The film is intended to inspire new perspectives and actions regarding the quality of Latinx and all transgender people in the US. Our close collaboration with equality activists committed to raising the visibility of trans people of color, especially Latinx people, is the first step to creating change through their protests. Through the film, more people could understand the struggles of the transgender community from within and therefore support the protests or form a positive public opinion.
Moreover, we plan a community screening campaign after the festival run for LGBTQ, Latinx, and equal rights activists with the aim to inspire transgender rights movements in the U.S. that would raise the visibility of the injustice the community is facing.
Regarding the connections we are planning to employ, we have engaged a vast number of prominent LGBTQ figures and allies such as Patricia Arquette and Rosario Dawson who are committed to supporting this campaign. Bamby’s organization TransLatin@ Coalition will also be an important partner in Southern California. We are exploring relationships with leading service organizations Lambda Legal, OutServe-SLDN, the Institute of Latino Policy and MANA, as well as a University-based screening and/or speaker series in partnerships with Queer and LGBT Resource Centers on select campuses with significant Latinx populations.
We are choosing to target the academic environment as we believe it is crucial to start open conversations in the learning environment to erase the fear of the unknown and influence the perspective of future generations, who would later become activists, thinkers, politicians, business owners, academics, and more. Our main hope is that this film will significantly contribute to the overall public mindset that according to Bamby is the first and most important step to the changes in governmental policies as well as acceptance of transgender people.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hey Everybody!</p>
<p>My name is Sean Small and I am a director/writer/actor based out of Los Angeles. I have been directing, acting in, and writing content for the past 12 years. I have directed shorts and web series that have been highly successful in the film circuit, won best actor in the LA Live Film Festival last year, and am currently shopping around various screenplays as we speak.</p>
<p>But, let's get to the reason why you are all here. This campaign was set up for the short <i>Lost, Not Forgotten,</i> a passion project I have been wanting to shoot for years. I know what you're thinking, why is this a passion project? Well, there was a seminal moment in my life that I thought could have led me down two very different paths. This moment was when my biological father decided to not be a part of my life. With the help of a strong single mother and an amazing support system along the way, I came out to be (at least I think) somewhat normal. This script is the other path I could have easily gone down.</p>
<p>With your contributions you would help in creating a film that will not only put forth an amazing story, but a true one that hopefully many can resonate with and never feel alone in the daily struggle that comes with this abandonment. This is the reason I produce. My main purpose is to get stories out there that connect and impact people that unfortunately are going through the same thing.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In order to create great content, we need great people! Film is a collaborative art, and in that regard I want to make sure everyone is the best of the best when it comes to cast and crew. With that said, we are trying to raise $10,000 in order to produce, shoot, edit, complete, and circulate this short through the film circuit after completion!</p>
<p>First, we want to pay our amazing cast and crew members. The Producers are taking no cut of this budget, only the people that will be working within the film. </p>
<p>Second, we will be paying for things like locations, production design, props, wardrobe, crafty, lunch (to feed the amazing crew and cast), and any miscellaneous things necessary to create the best quality film we can.</p>
<p>Lastly, once the film has been edited and the finishing touches have been added, we will use the remaining funds to apply to various film festivals in order to get this film seen by anyone and everyone! Hopefully this will bring either a distribution deal, or a possibility of expanding the short into a feature length film that will hit the big screen!</p>
<p>The thing we wanted to do with our campaign was give everyone the opportunity to benefit from the perks we are giving. For the highest contributors, we are promising to cut them in on any possible profits that come in the future. So when we make money on this, you would too! Our other exciting perks include an onset prop of your choosing, signed posters and shooting scripts, a digital screener, a social media shout out, and a Thank You in the credits!</p>
<p>It means a lot for us if you contribute, so no matter how much you contribute, we will be extremely appreciative! If you are unable to contribute, no worries, but we would kindly ask you to share and post this campaign wherever you see fit!</p>
<p>Now let's get the ball rolling and put <i>Lost, Not Forgotten</i> on the map!</p>

'The Mix' is a short thriller that takes place entirely in a recording studio, where podcast producer Becca makes repeatedly failed attempts to convince her stubborn spouse - and host Sean Palermo - to recognize the increasingly hostile threats being made by online conspiracy groups in opposition to special guest, Dr. Janet Weddley, who's promoting controversial views on differences in IQ.

The tone of The Mix combines the off-camera tension-building of Oliver Stone's interpretation of Talk Radio (1988) with the pacing precision David Fincher's Gone Girl (2014), and the industrial soundtracks of early 2000s Trent Reznor, Nine Inch Nails.


Christian LaMorte, is an NYC-based independent narrative filmmaker who's written and directed a number of short films focused on social topics such as male stereotypes, spiritual agnosticism  and modern social media addiction. He's a graduated with a BFA in Film Directing from School of Visual Arts, where his thesis film Boy Code was selected to premiere at the Max Ophuls Film Festival in Saarbrücken, Germany, as well as in Cannes Court Métrage in France. Boy Code was praised for it's realistic and disturbing interpretation of teen male peer pressures.
An obsessively creative/talented/passionate crew is on board for this film with some of my best friends and new collaberators.

<p><i>Nachiketa and the Lord of Death</i> is a modern retelling of the <i>Katha Upanishad</i>. The timeless tale follows the boy, Nachiketa, whose father sends him to the Lord of Death. With the Lord of Death, Nachiketa experiences deep spiritual truths, gains the key to enlightenment and discovers the secret of transcending the cycle of birth and death. Filmmakers Gayle Embrey and Hannah Holland are modern yoga practitioners endeavoring to bring this story to modern audiences by animating the classic Vedic story. </p>
<p>Gayle Embrey has been a documentary filmmaker since 2006. She has produced a number of films, as well as directed the documentary, <i>Beyond The Walls,</i> which had a very successful run in film festivals in 2014. Hannah Holland began working in television at Nickelodeon Studios in Orlando, FL. She has held many titles and been a Producer on a number of shows. Her most notable credits include <i>Global GUTS</i>, <i>Legends of the Hidden Temple</i>, and <i>All That</i>.</p>
<p>We’ve set an initial fund-raising goal of $10,000. These funds will allow us to hire an additional animator to move the project closer toward completion. Doing this will enable us to finish the film in time to submit for fall festival deadlines. Regardless of how much we raise, all funds will go directly toward paying animators for the film. </p>
<p>Every dollar we receive is important to us. Since we know that some people are able to comfortably give more than others, we want to offer the same perk regardless of donation size: an 8X10 photograph of our two animated main characters, Nachiketa and the Lord of Death, together. Another way you can contribute is by sharing about this project on social media, directing people to our campaign. </p>
<p>By contributing to the making of this film, you are supporting a fun, colorful and lively story that seeks to answer some of the most important questions about personal transformation as well as thoughts on the purpose of life, death and what happens after we die. </p>

<h3>About 'Jangle'</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Ned and Noah are about to spend their first Christmas living together as a couple. Ned is a total Jingle and is obsessed with anything Christmas, meanwhile Noah is a Jangle and despises the season. A clash of views is imminent, but will the relationship survive the rift?</p>
<p>In 2019, Simone Greenwood wrote a festively fabulous short film for Andrew Creak to direct, but sadly due to scheduling issues the project didn't take off. In 2020 the world was hit by a global pandemic, which meant once again Jangle couldn't go into production. Now in 2021 the gears are in motion and Jangle will be created for all to see!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>After a year of creative workers being left behind by the Westminster government, it is important, now more than ever, to ensure that people are paid for the work they do, while short films are often labours of love and passion projects, ethically it is important that people are paid for their work.</p>
<p>The money we raise from this crowdfunder will contribute to paying for the cast and crews time, locations, props and costumes, as well as providing PPE and ensuring the production is a covid safe environment.</p>
<p>Our goal for this short film £1,500 which in terms of short film productions is a micro budget, but this amount of money to working class film makers like myself is huge, so every little donation will go a long way in producing a fun festive short film. If we don't meet the target the money we do raise will still go towards this project, though some elements of the production may need to be changed to accommodate the lower budget.</p>
<p>If you decide to help us fund this short film then we will be offering a wide range of rewards, from early access to the script and production news before our social channels, early access to the finished film, and much more!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As a working class film maker, to forward your aspirations in becoming a director is hard without any disposable income at hand to fund your projects it is difficult to learn and adapt your style and forward your career.</p>
<p>This film also is important because of how it depicts queer lives, and not focusing around coming out or being closeted, but looking at problems that could affect anyone, no matter your sexuality or gender.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Filming in a world still in the grips of a pandemic is difficult, but I have recently worked as a Covid Compliance Officer across several well known productions, which have helped me gain an understanding of what is needed for the cast and crew to be safe.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We totally understand if you are unable to financially help with this production, but there are other ways you can help too! Such as sharing our crowdfunding campaign on your socials.</p>
<p>We are also looking for a shop or bar in Cardiff to film some short shots of one of the main characters at work to form a montage.</p>

Film production is an exciting process, but as you can see above it can be pretty costly!In exchange for your generous support, we have some dope perks for you! Check them out & make sure you, your family and your friends grab your favorite(s)! We appreciate you all being part of the Boxer family!Your ImpactYou as a contributor would be helping this amazing team of creatives accomplish something magical, to visually tell a story, proving that Black stories are layered, and filled with experiences that deserve to be shared on the big screen.  We get to see how people deal with trauma in the best possible ways, as well as struggles with accepting help, and being open to people and experiences that aid in healing. You would be helping the Boxer story and all its layers be a very tangible thing that is sure to warm hearts and engage minds.Risks & ChallengesLet's face it, making movies is challenging. It takes lots of time, effort, dedication and above all money. Movie-making is a collaborative effort across the board. There are really great movies that don't get made, and stories that don't get told, for the lack of funding. Simply put, we need your help. As we continue to apply for grants and such (wish us luck!), we have to also take matters into our own hands and make it happen.Other Ways You Can HelpAfter you donate, PLEASE don’t forget to share our campaign with friends & family. Spread the word via social media and word of mouth.

Because many fans have felt that the original My Bloody Valentine film needed a sequel and to this day they continue to ask for one. We as filmmakers and fans agree.  A little over a year ago, I had the idea of doing this fan film. I had the story in my head but that's where it stayed. I recall vending at Horror Hound Weekend years ago, and getting a picture with a cosplayer wearing an amazing Miner costume. I thought if I can find this guy, I can pitch my idea to him. After asking around for a while, a convention friend said it was a cosplayer named Chuck Ryan. So I reached out to this man whom I never met, and told him my idea. He was intrigued and asked to read my script which had not been written yet. In two weeks, I wrote the script and sent it off to Chuck. He contacted me and said ""I'm in""! Here we are one year later, and after a lot of production meetings, late nights, and after a near death experience due to Covid, we are ready to deliver not only a great story, but a gory one.<br/>- Tom Smith</p>

<p><strong>How can you let the person you love the most walk out of your life?</strong> Do we be selfish and fight for them to stay even if that means their unhappiness? Sometimes it takes sacrifice to let them move on. <i>Moving on</i> explores a couple realizing the relationship is done. We are shown the emotional toll of this decision through dance and we hope to leave you asking, Is it true that if you truly love someone you must let them go?</p>
<h3>Our Director's Heart</h3>
<p>Back in 2017 I was handling my own first real breakup from a long term relationship. I struggled with the initial breakup with realizing the relationship was at its end. I fought so hard to make the relationship work that it took time for me to accept it was done. I came across a song that just reflected what was currently going on in my life with this breakup. I just visualized this whole music video while hearing it for the first time. Back then I had no means as to how I could create a project like this. Now in 2021 I am in film school with the ability to make this dream a reality. Since this project hits home for me, I hope that I can share a little part of my past with the world. This chapter changed me and made me become my better self. It is my hope that this piece will tug on your heartstrings through both its dancing and its acting.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Bang for Your Buck</h3>
<p>If this piece has already begun to tug on your heart, we would love to see your support through donations. Donate what you can! Any size will help us to be one step closer to getting this project completed. As a plus to donating we are offering perks according to the amount you donate.</p>
<p>When you donate any amount, you get to see your name up on the <strong>big screen!</strong> Each of our donors will receive a thank-you in the credits and will be placed into tiers according to their donations:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1616519115/yygudapwxhrsernjk2tx.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Each donor will receive a .png of their respective medal, in honor of dance competitions. (This applies even for those who choose to donate by selecting a perk!) To donate for just a medal, select ""BACK IT"" at the top and donate your desired amount.</p>
<p>For those interested in additional perks, feel free to take a look at the ""perks"" section of this page! (Towards the top of this page on mobile and on the right hand side on desktop.)</p>
<p>In order to bring this dream to life, we will need to raise at least $1,000. These donations will be used approximately according to the following distribution:</p>

</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>With this project, I (the director) hope to show just how amazing dancers are at storytelling. Much of dance is acting and I would love to increase the public's awareness of that. Dancers are true artists and honestly deserve to be leads. </p>
<p>I also want to explore the hardships that happen in the midst of a breakup. Initially it can be overwhelming! I want viewers to see though that breakups are universally difficult and often require loving from afar, it's okay if your partner needs to move on.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>One of the biggest challenges that we anticipate is maintaining a safe and healthy working environment in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic while simultaneously achieving the utmost quality possible. Due to COVID-19 protocols, our personnel will be limited, making grand shots more difficult than usual. However, our crew members are top-notch at what they do and are largely well-versed in current health and safety protocols for set.</p>
<p>Another challenge we anticipate facing is reaching our funding goal. We recognize not everyone may be in a place to donate at the moment but we will need to reach our $1,000 goal in order to finance our location, the pending song license, COVID-19 supplies, and other various aforementioned production and distribution costs. If we are not able to reach this goal through fundraising, we will need to reimagine our location and distribution plans to suit the amount that we were able to raise.</p>

Sébastien Bouillé</b></b></p><b>
</b><p></p>
<p></p><p><b>Y’a-t-il une vie après la mort? Plusieurs? Existe-t-il des mondes parallèles, d’autres univers?</b></p><p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>Jusqu’à</b></span><b> lors, médiums, magnétiseurs ou victimes de chocs post-traumatiques suggéraient des pistes de réflexions. Depuis peu, certains chercheurs proposent des explications scientifiques à ces questions. Le but de ce documentaire est de mettre en corrélation ou en opposition les théories ésotériques et scientifiques,  pour apporter des réponses à ces questions que nous nous posons tous.</b></p><br/>
<p>Il existe de nombreux témoignages de
personnes qui affirment avoir fait une expérience de mort imminente, vivant une
décorporation et se voyant projetées dans un tunnel de lumière. </p>
<p>Celles qui disent en être revenues
sont changées. Elles ne perçoivent plus le monde comme avant. </p>
<p>Certaines avouent être devenues
capables d’entrer en résonance avec leur entourage, quand d’autres se disent
capables de prévoir ces événements.</p>
<p>La science n’a jamais accordé
beaucoup de crédit à tous ces témoignages. </p><p>Il y a quelques années, Eben Alexander, un neuro-chirurgien
extrêmement réputé tombe dans le coma. Il reprend miraculeusement conscience
quelques jours après. Alors qu'il était déclaré cliniquement mort (sans
activité cérébrale), il affirme avoir visité d'autres mondes.</p>Pour la première fois, un médecin osait parler de ce
phénomène.

<p><b>Emmanuel est grand reporter</b>. Spécialiste du Moyen-Orient, il est diplômé de sciences
politiques. En 2011, alors qu’il couvre la révolution du Nil en Egypte, il se
retrouve pris au milieu de violents affrontements et frôle la mort avec son
cameraman. </p>
<p>Au moment où l’un de ses agresseurs
tente de le poignarder, il éprouve l’étrange sensation de sortir de son corps
et voit se dessiner devant lui un halo lumineux. Il entend également une voix
qui lui dit qu’il ne doit pas avoir peur. 
En l’espace de quelques secondes, la situation
s’apaise.</p>
<p>Lorsqu'il rentre en France quelques
jours plus tard, Emmanuel sent qu’il a changé. Il est devenu
réceptif aux autres, plus « sensitif ». </p>
<p>Il commence un long travail de
recherches et d’enquête qui va lui permettre de rencontrer d’autres personnes
ayant vécu le même type d’expérience.</p>
<p><b>Anouck est magnétiseuse.</b> Elle a vécu une enfance difficile. A l’âge adulte, elle  tombe très malade. Ces expériences,
douloureuses, vont créer un traumatisme. </p>
<p>Avec le temps, elle découvre qu’elle
possède la faculté de guérir les gens par l’apposition des mains et qu’elle
possède également le don de précognition. Elle dit communiquer avec un être de
l’au-delà, qui la protège.</p>
<p>En novembre 2013, dans les environs
de Montpellier, une jeune femme est victime d’un accident de la route et décède.
<b>Elle s’appelait Jehnza ; elle était
chanteuse et venait de terminer, quelques jours plus tôt, son premier album. </b></p>
<p><b>Son producteur, Marc-Eric,</b> était aussi son compagnon dans la vie. Marc-Eric sort d’un
milieu intellectuel. C’est un chef d’entreprise dynamique, qui produit et<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> compose également des bandes sonores pour la
télévision.</span></p>
<p>Depuis le
décès de Jehnza, il s’est livré à de nombreuses expériences, notamment
chamaniques. Il a ainsi découvert que son esprit pouvait entrer en résonance
avec un autre monde. Il explique parfois sentir la
présence de Jehnza.</p>
<p></p><p>Tout au long de l’enquête, <b>Christophe M</b>, un psychotérapeute spécialiste des chocs post traumatiques ayant été confronté à des EMI de patients (Expériences de Mort Imminente), décryptera l’enquête.</p><p>Des scientifiques soumettront également les protagonistes de l’histoire à des tests précis, qui devront permettre de comprendre si ceux-ci sont victimes d’hallucinations ou s’ils sont réellement connectés à un autre monde, une autre vie … quelque part, ailleurs !..</p><p></p>
<p>Ces trois personnages vont constituer
les fils rouges de notre film documentaire, qui nous conduira de la France aux
Etats-Unis. Leurs histoires seront entrecoupées de témoignages de scientifiques,
d’expérience réalisées en laboratoire (notamment avec Anouck) et de
spécialistes reconnus des phénomènes paranormaux.</p>
<p>Son récit sera celui d’une quête qui
nous permettra de savoir s’il existe bel et bien une vie après la vie, où s’il
agit simplement de phénomènes hallucinatoires.</p><p><br/></p><p>Interview de Sébastien Bouillé, réalisateur du documentaire.</p>
<p><b>Quel est l’objectif de votre film ?</b></p>
<p>Ce film doit permettre de donner des
réponses, d’un point de vue scientifique, à tous les gens qui ont été
confrontés à des expériences de mort imminente, comme à ceux qui ont perdu un
être proche et qui continuent de sentir leur présence. Des scientifiques ont
récemment tenté de démontrer qu’une fois que nous sommes morts, notre
conscience continue d’avoir une activité. En
Russie, un chercheur a démontré récemment que le corps expulse une énergie au
moment de la mort. Le documentaire evoquera ces avancées scientifiques.</p>
<p><b>Pourquoi demander aux internautes de financer ce documentaire ?</b></p>
<p>Nous nous demandons tous s’il y a quelque chose après la mort.  C'est pourquoi nous avons décidé de rendre ce documentaire accessible au plus grand nombre, gratuitement. Mais nous avons besoin de mécènes.<br/></p>
<p><b>Vous-même, croyez-vous qu’il y ait une vie après la mort ?</b></p>
<p>Je ne sais pas.  L'objectif de ce film est justement d'apporter une ou plusieurs réponses à cette question.<br/></p>
<p><b>Sur quel type de média le film sera-t-il diffusé ?</b></p>
<p>« Vers d’autres vie », sera
diffusé en ligne gratuitement en français et en anglais sur une chaîne Internet
du site YouTube mais aussi via des sites d’informations nationaux et régionaux
auxquels nous céderons gratuitement les droits de diffusion.</p>
<p><b>Pourquoi avoir choisi
Internet et pas la télévision ?</b></p>
<p>Réaliser un documentaire pour la
télévision, média pour lequel je travaille depuis des années, répond à des
impératifs de format et de temps de tournage<b>. </b> Même sur les chaînes
culturelles et scientifiques, la vocation d’une chaîne de télévision est d’être
commerciale et de répondre à des critères précis. Si je juge avec mon
équipe que le film mérite 90 minutes ou plus, je peux le faire. Et le documentaire doit être accessible à tous. Internet est un média universel. </p>
<p><b>Comment avez-vous choisi les témoins qui vont intervenir dans votre
documentaire?</b></p>
<p>Je travaille sur le sujet depuis
trois ans. Lors de mon enquête, j’ai pu rencontrer des gens ayant vécu des EMI,
d’autres qui se disent en contact avec l’au-delà, des médecins, des
psychanalystes et des religieux ... A l’issue de ce travail de fond, j’ai choisi
des personnes comme Anouck et Marc Eric car leurs expériences, bien que
différentes, nous ramènent toujours à la même question : Y-a t-il une vie
après la vie ? Anouck comme Marc-Eric ont de plus accepté que je les mette
en situation et d’être confronté au monde médical et scientifique. Nous
nous livrerons donc à quelques expériences avec eux. </p>
<p><b>Les internautes auront-ils leur mot à dire sur le film?</b></p><p><b></b></p><p>Nous consultons beaucoup les forums sur internet qui portent sur la question de la vie après la mort. Cela nous aide dans nos réflexions et sur le choix des pistes à exploiter. Nous créons également des fils de discussion sur ces forums pour savoir ce que chacun attend du documentaire. C'est aussi une source d'inspiration.<br/></p>
<p><b>Vous êtes connu pour vos reportages de guerre au Moyen-Orient. Avec ce
film, vous n’avez pas peur qu’on vous attende au tournant ?</b></p>
<p>Non. Je travaille avec des gens de
confiance depuis des années. Ceux qui me connaissent savent que je suis très
pragmatique et bien loin d’avoir la tête dans les étoiles.</p>
<p><b>Une dernière question : Votre film coûte près de 60 000 euros.
N’est pas un gros budget?</b></p>
<p>Non. Un film documentaire, réalisé
selon des critères professionnels, coûte rarement moins de 130 000 euros pour
quelques mois de travail. Là, nous travaillons sur le projet depuis trois ans. La
société de production avec laquelle je travaille a d’ailleurs financé la moitié
de mes recherches. Elle a mis à la disposition de mon équipe des moyens
techniques conséquents, ce qui a constitué 30% du budget. Qu’il s’agisse des
journalistes, techniciens ou même de moi, tous ont accepté de travailler sur ce
film documentaire à moitié prix ou gratuitement, ce qui explique le coût
relativement faible pour un projet de ce genre. </p><p>Le projet étant déjà financé à 42%, le budget nécessaire pour achever la réalisation de notre film est de 60 000 euros qui se répartit comme suit (ce budget est indicatif, plus il sera important plus l'enquête sera fournie):<br/></p><p><br/></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1153390/files/20150116053857-diagramme_indiegogo2.JPG?1421415537"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><br/><p><br/></p><p></p><p></p><p><b>L'équipe</b></p><p><b></b></p><p><b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1138463/files/20150108112929-Seb.JPG?1420745369"" src="""" style=""""/></b></p><b><br/></b><p></p><p></p><p><b>Sébastien Bouillé</b>  est co-fondateur, directeur d’agence et grand

<p><b>What are the
objectives of your documentary?</b></p>
<p>This film
should allow us  to provide answers, from a scientific point of view, to
all the people who have faced a near-death experiences, as well as people who
have lost close family members or relations and who still feel their presence.
Scientists recently tried to demonstrate that once we are dead, our mind
continues its activity. In Russia, a searcher recently proved that the human
expel energy at death moment. This documentary will evoque these scientific
progresses. </p>
<p><b>Why ask

<p>We all ask
ourselves if something exists after our death. That's why we decided to make
this documentary available to everybody for free. But for this, we need support
and sponsors.</p>
<p><b>How about
 you? Do you believe that there is a life after death?</b></p>

<p><b>Why did you
choose Internet and not television?</b></p>
<p>Producing a
documentary for television, a media I have worked for,  for many years, is
restricted, in terms of timescale and of format type.  Even on cultural
and scientific TV channels, the vocation of a TV channel is commercial and
shouldcorrespond to precise criteria. Here, if my team and I judge that the
movie should last 90minutes or more, I can do it. And the documentary  has to  be available to everybody, Internet being an univeral
media.</p>
<p><b>How
did you choose the witnesses who will take part in your documentary?</b></p>
<p>I
have been working on the subject for 3 years. During my investigation, I was
lucky to meet people who experienced NDE, others who say they are in contact
with the afterlife, doctors, psychoanalyst, clergymen… At the end of my
research, I chose people such as Anouck and Marc Eric because their
experiences, even if they are very different, always bring back us to the same
question: Is there a life after life? Anouck and Marc Eric also accepted to be
confronted with the medical and scientific world. We will carry out some
experiments with them.</p>
<p><b>Can internet
users give their opinion about the film ?</b></p>
<p>We consult a
lot of forum discussions which deal with this topic on Internet. This helps us
in our reflexion and in the choice of avenues to explore.  We also create
discussions on these forums in order to know what people are expecting from our
documentary. This is also an inspiration for us.</p>
<p><b>« You
are known for your war documentaries in the Middle East. With this documentary,
are you not worried that people are waiting to catch you out? »</b></p>
<p>No, I
completely trust the team I have been working with for many years. Everybody
who knows me, knows that I have a pragmatic attitude and  that I am far
from having my head in the clouds.</p>
<p><b>Your
documentary cost about 75,000$ , that’s a huge budget, isn’t it?</b></p>
<p>No, a
documentary produced according to professional criteria, costs rarely less than
130 000€ for a few months work. In this case , we have been working on this
project for three years. The production company which I’m working with financed
half of my research. They allowed my team to use a lot of technical equipment,
which represents about 30% of the budget. The journalists, technicians and even
myself agreed to work for free or half salary, that explains the relatively low
cost for this kind of project. </p>
<p>The project
has already recieved 42% of its financing, the budget we need to finalise our
film is 60 000 euros which can be broken down as follows ; ( this
budget is only a guide, the higher it is, the more developed the documentary
will be)</p>

Sébastien Bouillé

Y’a-t-il une vie après la mort? Plusieurs? Existe-t-il des mondes parallèles, d’autres univers?Jusqu’à lors, médiums, magnétiseurs ou victimes de chocs post-traumatiques suggéraient des pistes de réflexions. Depuis peu, certains chercheurs proposent des explications scientifiques à ces questions. Le but de ce documentaire est de mettre en corrélation ou en opposition les théories ésotériques et scientifiques,  pour apporter des réponses à ces questions que nous nous posons tous.
Il existe de nombreux témoignages de
personnes qui affirment avoir fait une expérience de mort imminente, vivant une
décorporation et se voyant projetées dans un tunnel de lumière. 
Celles qui disent en être revenues
sont changées. Elles ne perçoivent plus le monde comme avant. 
Certaines avouent être devenues
capables d’entrer en résonance avec leur entourage, quand d’autres se disent
capables de prévoir ces événements.
La science n’a jamais accordé
beaucoup de crédit à tous ces témoignages. Il y a quelques années, Eben Alexander, un neuro-chirurgien
extrêmement réputé tombe dans le coma. Il reprend miraculeusement conscience
quelques jours après. Alors qu'il était déclaré cliniquement mort (sans
activité cérébrale), il affirme avoir visité d'autres mondes.Pour la première fois, un médecin osait parler de ce
phénomène.

Emmanuel est grand reporter. Spécialiste du Moyen-Orient, il est diplômé de sciences
politiques. En 2011, alors qu’il couvre la révolution du Nil en Egypte, il se
retrouve pris au milieu de violents affrontements et frôle la mort avec son
cameraman. 
Au moment où l’un de ses agresseurs
tente de le poignarder, il éprouve l’étrange sensation de sortir de son corps
et voit se dessiner devant lui un halo lumineux. Il entend également une voix
qui lui dit qu’il ne doit pas avoir peur. 
En l’espace de quelques secondes, la situation
s’apaise.
Lorsqu'il rentre en France quelques
jours plus tard, Emmanuel sent qu’il a changé. Il est devenu
réceptif aux autres, plus « sensitif ». 
Il commence un long travail de
recherches et d’enquête qui va lui permettre de rencontrer d’autres personnes
ayant vécu le même type d’expérience.
Anouck est magnétiseuse. Elle a vécu une enfance difficile. A l’âge adulte, elle  tombe très malade. Ces expériences,
douloureuses, vont créer un traumatisme. 
Avec le temps, elle découvre qu’elle
possède la faculté de guérir les gens par l’apposition des mains et qu’elle
possède également le don de précognition. Elle dit communiquer avec un être de
l’au-delà, qui la protège.
En novembre 2013, dans les environs
de Montpellier, une jeune femme est victime d’un accident de la route et décède.
Elle s’appelait Jehnza ; elle était
chanteuse et venait de terminer, quelques jours plus tôt, son premier album. 
Son producteur, Marc-Eric, était aussi son compagnon dans la vie. Marc-Eric sort d’un
milieu intellectuel. C’est un chef d’entreprise dynamique, qui produit et compose également des bandes sonores pour la
télévision.
Depuis le
décès de Jehnza, il s’est livré à de nombreuses expériences, notamment
chamaniques. Il a ainsi découvert que son esprit pouvait entrer en résonance
avec un autre monde. Il explique parfois sentir la
présence de Jehnza.
Tout au long de l’enquête, Christophe M, un psychotérapeute spécialiste des chocs post traumatiques ayant été confronté à des EMI de patients (Expériences de Mort Imminente), décryptera l’enquête.Des scientifiques soumettront également les protagonistes de l’histoire à des tests précis, qui devront permettre de comprendre si ceux-ci sont victimes d’hallucinations ou s’ils sont réellement connectés à un autre monde, une autre vie … quelque part, ailleurs !..
Ces trois personnages vont constituer
les fils rouges de notre film documentaire, qui nous conduira de la France aux
Etats-Unis. Leurs histoires seront entrecoupées de témoignages de scientifiques,
d’expérience réalisées en laboratoire (notamment avec Anouck) et de
spécialistes reconnus des phénomènes paranormaux.
Son récit sera celui d’une quête qui
nous permettra de savoir s’il existe bel et bien une vie après la vie, où s’il
agit simplement de phénomènes hallucinatoires.Interview de Sébastien Bouillé, réalisateur du documentaire.
Quel est l’objectif de votre film ?
Ce film doit permettre de donner des
réponses, d’un point de vue scientifique, à tous les gens qui ont été
confrontés à des expériences de mort imminente, comme à ceux qui ont perdu un
être proche et qui continuent de sentir leur présence. Des scientifiques ont
récemment tenté de démontrer qu’une fois que nous sommes morts, notre
conscience continue d’avoir une activité. En
Russie, un chercheur a démontré récemment que le corps expulse une énergie au
moment de la mort. Le documentaire evoquera ces avancées scientifiques.
Pourquoi demander aux internautes de financer ce documentaire ?
Nous nous demandons tous s’il y a quelque chose après la mort.  C'est pourquoi nous avons décidé de rendre ce documentaire accessible au plus grand nombre, gratuitement. Mais nous avons besoin de mécènes.
Vous-même, croyez-vous qu’il y ait une vie après la mort ?
Je ne sais pas.  L'objectif de ce film est justement d'apporter une ou plusieurs réponses à cette question.
Sur quel type de média le film sera-t-il diffusé ?
« Vers d’autres vie », sera
diffusé en ligne gratuitement en français et en anglais sur une chaîne Internet
du site YouTube mais aussi via des sites d’informations nationaux et régionaux
auxquels nous céderons gratuitement les droits de diffusion.
Pourquoi avoir choisi
Internet et pas la télévision ?
Réaliser un documentaire pour la
télévision, média pour lequel je travaille depuis des années, répond à des
impératifs de format et de temps de tournage.  Même sur les chaînes
culturelles et scientifiques, la vocation d’une chaîne de télévision est d’être
commerciale et de répondre à des critères précis. Si je juge avec mon
équipe que le film mérite 90 minutes ou plus, je peux le faire. Et le documentaire doit être accessible à tous. Internet est un média universel. 
Comment avez-vous choisi les témoins qui vont intervenir dans votre
documentaire?
Je travaille sur le sujet depuis
trois ans. Lors de mon enquête, j’ai pu rencontrer des gens ayant vécu des EMI,
d’autres qui se disent en contact avec l’au-delà, des médecins, des
psychanalystes et des religieux ... A l’issue de ce travail de fond, j’ai choisi
des personnes comme Anouck et Marc Eric car leurs expériences, bien que
différentes, nous ramènent toujours à la même question : Y-a t-il une vie
après la vie ? Anouck comme Marc-Eric ont de plus accepté que je les mette
en situation et d’être confronté au monde médical et scientifique. Nous
nous livrerons donc à quelques expériences avec eux. 
Les internautes auront-ils leur mot à dire sur le film?Nous consultons beaucoup les forums sur internet qui portent sur la question de la vie après la mort. Cela nous aide dans nos réflexions et sur le choix des pistes à exploiter. Nous créons également des fils de discussion sur ces forums pour savoir ce que chacun attend du documentaire. C'est aussi une source d'inspiration.
Vous êtes connu pour vos reportages de guerre au Moyen-Orient. Avec ce
film, vous n’avez pas peur qu’on vous attende au tournant ?
Non. Je travaille avec des gens de
confiance depuis des années. Ceux qui me connaissent savent que je suis très
pragmatique et bien loin d’avoir la tête dans les étoiles.
Une dernière question : Votre film coûte près de 60 000 euros.
N’est pas un gros budget?
Non. Un film documentaire, réalisé
selon des critères professionnels, coûte rarement moins de 130 000 euros pour
quelques mois de travail. Là, nous travaillons sur le projet depuis trois ans. La
société de production avec laquelle je travaille a d’ailleurs financé la moitié
de mes recherches. Elle a mis à la disposition de mon équipe des moyens
techniques conséquents, ce qui a constitué 30% du budget. Qu’il s’agisse des
journalistes, techniciens ou même de moi, tous ont accepté de travailler sur ce
film documentaire à moitié prix ou gratuitement, ce qui explique le coût
relativement faible pour un projet de ce genre. Le projet étant déjà financé à 42%, le budget nécessaire pour achever la réalisation de notre film est de 60 000 euros qui se répartit comme suit (ce budget est indicatif, plus il sera important plus l'enquête sera fournie):L'équipeSébastien Bouillé  est co-fondateur, directeur d’agence et grand
reporter à BEW TV. Il a travaillé sur un grand nombre de sujets tels que la
reconstruction de Gaza après la guerre, les Réfugiés Syrien en Jordanie, le
combat des Kurdes en Irak ou la résistance chrétienne en Syrie. Ses reportages
ont été diffusés dans d’importantes chaines de média en France et à
l’international comme TF1, France 24, Babel Press et Canal+. Il a travaillé

« You
are known for your war documentaries in the Middle East. With this documentary,
are you not worried that people are waiting to catch you out? »
No, I
completely trust the team I have been working with for many years. Everybody
who knows me, knows that I have a pragmatic attitude and  that I am far
from having my head in the clouds.
Your
documentary cost about 75,000$ , that’s a huge budget, isn’t it?
No, a
documentary produced according to professional criteria, costs rarely less than
130 000€ for a few months work. In this case , we have been working on this
project for three years. The production company which I’m working with financed
half of my research. They allowed my team to use a lot of technical equipment,
which represents about 30% of the budget. The journalists, technicians and even
myself agreed to work for free or half salary, that explains the relatively low
cost for this kind of project. 
The project
has already recieved 42% of its financing, the budget we need to finalise our
film is 60 000 euros which can be broken down as follows ; ( this
budget is only a guide, the higher it is, the more developed the documentary
will be)

Who are we ?

We, A Hand for A House of Dreams, are an Austrian NGO committed to give our children a second chance to a secure life, to their healing of what often is a painful past, to a future protected from the hazards of poverty and the exclusion lack of education brings. We work closely with a Nepalese family, who’s grassroots NGO provides care on the ground.

  www.hhdprogram.org

From Europe to Asia, our teams and volunteers, work hand in hand to ensure the effectiveness of the work we are doing.





We believe the greatest of dreams are achieved one small step at the time. Today, our project aims at providing them a decent and safe house.


Why build a house ?
A house is a shelter. A basic need. And in Nepal, it can be so much more:

ECONOMIC SECURITY: Through property ownership, the Nepalese organization we are supporting can turn into a sustainable infrastructure, attract further investments and develop revenue generating socio-economic activities.


EDUCATION: Children in stable environments can follow a proper education without being dragged from school to school, regularly attend classes and have a better focus on their superior studies.


HEALTH: By providing most decent conditions and facilities, preserving a good hygiene environment and maintaining education at the earliest age.


SAFETY: By avoiding another forced eviction, constructing a secure structure for natural disasters and building safe accommodations to prevent from criminal activities in and around the house (e.g. house break-in)


COMMUNITY: Housing, as a social priority, helps creating social stability, improving the local integration and preserving the cultural identity.








What do we need ?
Our wish for the coming year is to build one house for 15 people. A house adapted and suitable to their needs :


- 6 rooms with individual beds and wardrobes (1 for boys, 1 for girls, 2 for the Nepalese family and 2 for volunteers)
- 1 study room with desks, furniture storage, library and computers
- 1 kitchen with place at the table for everyone and safe cooking equipment
- 2 bathrooms, good sanitaries and 1 nursery
- 1 generator for back-up electric power
- a garden for vegetables farming and piece of land for playground area
Without land purchasing, we need around 35.000€.  Out of this amount:
 - 60% will go to actual construction costs 
 - 10% to workforce
 - 20% to building permits and governmental taxes
 - 5% to transport, organization, operational costs
 - 5% to furniture and equipment
This is a community-based project – that is, all materials and workforce will be sourced locally to help to develop the local economy and boost the incomes of local families.

<p>
</p>
<p>John Lincoln and David Roman Daniels met while working on marriage rights campaigns and have both work on numerous film projects.   First
John is the author, together they are complementary directors, finally, David is the editor.<br/></p>
<p>We add a very talented cast and crew. Patrick Toolan, our protagonist, plays Mark. He is the up and coming politician who has the knack of finding ways to get into trouble. Mark's good-looking boyfriend (Sean) is played by Timothy Bowman. He is both as adorable as he is oblivious to Mark's shortcomings. However, Sean sees Mark as the love of his life and has a reckless passion that will not wait for a single moment to advance their relationship whenever possible. <br/></p>
<p>Complicating matters further for Mark is his ex-wife Carrolyn portrayed by the lovely and talented T'Lane Balue who fixes up a batch of life-changing surprises that will effect both Mark and their child Kate (Kira McLean). The delightful character Donna, played by Carrie Lynette Stringfellow, who is the secretary who manages both the campaign office and her boss Mark in her own creative way. She interplays well with Alhaji Sesay who plays Paul the campaign manager and Mark's childhood best friend.</p>

We are six college-age young men from different backgrounds united by two things: our love of God and our desire to save our generation, Generation Y. Living in Chicago, we’ve seen firsthand the pitfalls and moral decline of our generation. The nation knows our city as the “Chi-raq"" because they see nothing on their television but stories of suffering and violence, but fail to see beyond that. In the study of medicine, one learns that treating symptoms is temporary. Unless you treat the cause, the symptoms will return. The moral decline and heinous crimes committed in all corners of the world are merely symptoms. To find the cause, we must be willing to look within ourselves. However, before people can begin enacting change, they must decide within themselves if change is possible. They must have hope. Our next project aims to give them an in-depth look into our society and our generation through, not only, evidence, but the eyes of members of Generation Y and older generations to determine if there is hope for the future. But we need your help.</p><p>We have covered many expenses out of our own pockets, but that has its limitations. We need to raise $10,000 to cover the further expenses of the film so that we may move forward with the vision. So we're turning to our strongest supporters to ask for contributions. It is said too often that we want change, but we don’t want to change. This is our chance to be a part of something far greater than ourselves. This is not just a documentary, it’s a movement. In the immortal words of Mahatma Gandhi, this is our chance to “be the change [we] wish to see in the world”. Your contribution will help us cover the cost of paying editors, sound mixers, and a variety of other expenses when piecing together a film,  but, most importantly, it will enable us to bring our vision of showing an honest depiction of society into fruition. Please join us as we move forward. Thank you for your time and thank you for your contribution, and welcome to The Harvest. </p><p></p><p><b>WHAT WE ARE AIMING TO RAISE, AND WHY</b></p><p>We are aiming to raise a total of <b>$10,000</b> which may seem like a lot but there is a considerable amount of costs that we must factor in:</p><p><b><u>Color Grader/Editor ($2,500)</u></b></p><p>A color grader is essential to making the film look good. As most of this footage has been shot documentary style, which means that it was explicitly shot on-the-go and in action, and much of it is either over-exposed or in the dark. We need a color grader to correct these technical glitches and make it look aesthetically pleasing. Our color grader will also be doing the bulk of the editorial work.</p><p><b><u>Editor ($1,000)</u></b></p><p>Hiring an editor is an essential part of this process. An editor brings technical expertise and knowledge of how to structure a visual narrative to best portray the message; without an editor, making a film wouldn't be possible.</p><p><b><u>Music ($1,000)</u></b></p><p>We have some great personal and artists on board to create the soundtrack and musical score for our film. The work of these talented people will help to set the backdrop for our scenes, and they must, of course, be compensated for their hard work.</p><p><b><u>Sound Mixer ($1,000)</u></b></p><p>Like a color grader, a sound mixer is needed to cut out the unnecessary background noise in a shot. This enhances the dialogue and gives you, as the audience, a clearer sound.</p><p><b><u>Animation Director ($500)</u></b></p><p>An animation director is responsible for creating stop-motion and other graphic sections of the film. The amount of labor that goes into this area of filmmaking is absolutely painstaking, and begs to be compensated as such.</p><p><b><u>Equipment ($800)</u></b></p><p>Although we have used our own cameras and equipment where we can, we have discovered throughout the process that we needed to buy more hard-drives, microphones and lenses, all out of our own pocket.</p><p><b><u>Outreach &amp; Communications ($1,000)</u></b></p><p>This refers mainly to the promotion and buzz around the film. We need money to go towards flyers, posters, website and artwork amongst other things.</p><p><b><u></u></b></p><p><b><u>Stock Footage ($1,000)</u></b></p><p>While we have filmed the majority of what will be shown, however, there is still a need for the use of public footage.</p><p><b><u>Distribution ($1,200)</u></b></p><p>Finally, once the film has been made, we need to get it seen.

We are six college-age young men from different backgrounds united by two things: our love of God and our desire to save our generation, Generation Y. Living in Chicago, we’ve seen firsthand the pitfalls and moral decline of our generation. The nation knows our city as the “Chi-raq"" because they see nothing on their television but stories of suffering and violence, but fail to see beyond that. In the study of medicine, one learns that treating symptoms is temporary. Unless you treat the cause, the symptoms will return. The moral decline and heinous crimes committed in all corners of the world are merely symptoms. To find the cause, we must be willing to look within ourselves. However, before people can begin enacting change, they must decide within themselves if change is possible. They must have hope. Our next project aims to give them an in-depth look into our society and our generation through, not only, evidence, but the eyes of members of Generation Y and older generations to determine if there is hope for the future. But we need your help.We have covered many expenses out of our own pockets, but that has its limitations. We need to raise $10,000 to cover the further expenses of the film so that we may move forward with the vision. So we're turning to our strongest supporters to ask for contributions. It is said too often that we want change, but we don’t want to change. This is our chance to be a part of something far greater than ourselves. This is not just a documentary, it’s a movement. In the immortal words of Mahatma Gandhi, this is our chance to “be the change [we] wish to see in the world”. Your contribution will help us cover the cost of paying editors, sound mixers, and a variety of other expenses when piecing together a film,  but, most importantly, it will enable us to bring our vision of showing an honest depiction of society into fruition. Please join us as we move forward. Thank you for your time and thank you for your contribution, and welcome to The Harvest. WHAT WE ARE AIMING TO RAISE, AND WHYWe are aiming to raise a total of $10,000 which may seem like a lot but there is a considerable amount of costs that we must factor in:Color Grader/Editor ($2,500)A color grader is essential to making the film look good. As most of this footage has been shot documentary style, which means that it was explicitly shot on-the-go and in action, and much of it is either over-exposed or in the dark. We need a color grader to correct these technical glitches and make it look aesthetically pleasing. Our color grader will also be doing the bulk of the editorial work.Editor ($1,000)Hiring an editor is an essential part of this process. An editor brings technical expertise and knowledge of how to structure a visual narrative to best portray the message; without an editor, making a film wouldn't be possible.Music ($1,000)We have some great personal and artists on board to create the soundtrack and musical score for our film. The work of these talented people will help to set the backdrop for our scenes, and they must, of course, be compensated for their hard work.Sound Mixer ($1,000)Like a color grader, a sound mixer is needed to cut out the unnecessary background noise in a shot. This enhances the dialogue and gives you, as the audience, a clearer sound.Animation Director ($500)An animation director is responsible for creating stop-motion and other graphic sections of the film. The amount of labor that goes into this area of filmmaking is absolutely painstaking, and begs to be compensated as such.Equipment ($800)Although we have used our own cameras and equipment where we can, we have discovered throughout the process that we needed to buy more hard-drives, microphones and lenses, all out of our own pocket.Outreach & Communications ($1,000)This refers mainly to the promotion and buzz around the film. We need money to go towards flyers, posters, website and artwork amongst other things.Stock Footage ($1,000)While we have filmed the majority of what will be shown, however, there is still a need for the use of public footage.Distribution ($1,200)Finally, once the film has been made, we need to get it seen. We need money for film festival entries, private screening costs, travel to festivals and screenings, DVD authoring, shipping and venue hire.We have tried our hardest to keep the cost as low as possible. We have pulled favors from friends, and are all currently working for free! However, our resources and contacts are running out. We want to be able to finish the film in a way that it deserves.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Revealed,"" and the producer of the upcoming feature-length documentary, ""Atlantis
Revealed!"".<br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Before discussing further the upcoming
film, first and foremost, I must confess that when I first started the research
for my latest book (more of a passion project that touches on several controversial
topics), I never in a million years thought I'd be able to locate a site that in
every way will match Plato's Atlantis. Even later, more than two years into the
project, when eventually all clues brought me to look for Atlantis within the
Mediterranean Sea, still, in all honesty I was not sure where to look for it.<br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">I remember thinking, if Plato's given
chronology on Atlantis coincided with the rise of the oceans at the end of the
last Ice Age, then, this island could have gotten lost during the rapid rise of
the Mediterranean,  just prior to the
flooding of the Black Sea and roughly 10,000 years ago. If so, then Plato's
lost island should only be 400 feet beneath the waves and not few miles deep, as
some researchers theorized in the past. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The search was lengthy, challenging, and
at times I felt it would never come to fruition. Even when I spotted my first
real clue, an underwater plateau around the Cyclades Islands, I did not fully
understand the significance of the find until several hours later, when I was
able to outline its entire shape. Only then I realized that the submerged
super-island I just found, formed by the Cyclades Plateau, perfectly matched
Plato's description Atlantis. The chronology, every physical aspect of the
topography, the volcanic geology, the flora and fauna in that period, the
island's destruction by a ""great flood"", archaeological remnants of an
unknown prehistoric civilization in the immediate area, all pointed to a genuine
discovery. And that was not all"".</span></p>

<br/><h1>The Book</h1>
<p>At
around 360 BC, in his dialogues of Timaeus and Critias, the Greek philosopher
Plato introduced an incredible story, a tale of an enigmatic island civilization
which since captivated the imagination of every generation that followed. This
was the story of Atlantis, one of the most advanced societies of the ancient
world, a prehistoric civilization capable of crossing the Atlantic Ocean more
than 10,000 years ago. </p>
<p>Today,
regardless of the many archaeological discoveries which support Plato's claim of
such advanced culture (like that of Gobekli Tepe in Turkey, the Lost city of
Ubar in the Arabian Peninsula, the submerged city off the coast of west India
in the Gulf of Cambay, and others), many skeptics choose to point to the several
inconsistencies in Plato's story (like Athens or Egypt did not exist ten
millennia ago, when according to Plato the story took place) and quickly label
Atlantis as a myth. Are the skeptics correct though?</p>
<p>Just
as in the case of Atlantis, for several centuries we thought that the city of
Troy, the centerpiece in Homer’s epic saga, was also a myth. All that changed
obviously when Heinrich Schliemann, an amateur archaeologist, found Troy in
1868 while following location tips from Homer’s book Iliad. In the case of
Troy, after ditching all the details regarding beauty queens, demigods, Trojan
horses and scaled back the armies to more rational levels, it was ultimately
acknowledged by the scientific community that the setting as well as the bulk
of this story was real. Essentially, Homer’s entirely fictional story, which he
filled with principles and common elements from his own time, apparently
revolved around a tangible setting and a real incident which took place nearly
six centuries before his time. Of course, Troy is not an isolated example. Our
recorded history is full of stories that contain serious discrepancies and
circumstances where once mythological places, or ""fairy tales"", in
the end turned out to be true!</p>
<p>So, a fundamental question remains. Was
Atlantis simply a cautionary tale or is it possible Plato crafted a tale based
on a real setting and a prehistoric civilization known to ancient Greeks, while
he supplemented all the “modern” details as Homer did few hundred years before
him?</p>
<p><b>If true, as
in the case of Troy, the <u>true-part</u> of this story should not rest in the story
plot, but in the detection and authentication of Plato’s “lost island.” </b></p>
<p>Locating a matching site, along with signs of
an advanced civilization in the immediate area, should be the first step in
solving this mystery.</p>
<p>Indeed, a recent discovery of a sunken island
that perfectly matches Plato's Atlantis, found in the right period as well as
the right location (more on the location later), if anything, it further
suggests that Plato based his story on real a prehistoric civilization, which
in order to successfully communicate some of his philosophical ideas (divine
vs. human, ideal societies vs. corrupt,) he filled with familiar matter and
details from later times. </p>
<p>So, unlike earlier theories and faulty interpretations
of the story which place Atlantis all over the Atlantic Ocean, in Spain, off
the coast of Cyprus, at the Azores Islands, in Antarctica and other places (without
ever offering a matching site), the recent discovery shows that Plato's
Atlantis was a prehistoric super-island in the Aegean Sea at the doorstep of
Greece, and not in some far-away location. Even when setting aside all the other
clues that lead to the same conclusion, Plato's
own words <i>“your State (Greece) stayed the
course of a mighty host,”</i> clearly suggests that Atlantis, as a “host” of
mainland Greece, stood at Greece's doorstep and ultimately controlled the path,
or better yet, the waters leading into the Aegean Sea. True enough! As it turns out, ten
millennia ago, with sea levels lower by 400 feet, the modern day Cyclades
Islands were connected by a flat terrain, today known as the ""Cyclades
Plateau"". This massive plateau formed a super-island that when comparing
to Atlantis, in every way it matches Plato's description (see Plato's quotation
and image below). If Atlantis was ever real, this must have been the place
Plato was talking about. Not only the geography is identical, the volcanic
geology is there, but when further comparing to Plato's account, the flora and
fauna, including elephants, chronologically match the topography. How is this
possible? To be able to locate a place that slightly resembles Plato’s Atlantis is
extremely difficult, to produce one where all the physical aspects perfectly
match, is virtually impossible, unless of course the proposed site is the real
thing. When up
until today, to prove Atlantis real, the most difficult task was to find a place
that matched Plato's description, now that we have such a place, how can
skeptics explain this finding away? Not only we now have a matching site but
relics from an unknown pre-Bronze civilization in the immediate area further
reinforce this discovery. </p>

<p>Of course, as skeptics often do, without ever attempting to explain
away the matching site, many will quickly point that according to Plato (see Plato's
text below) Atlantis was somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean and not in the
Mediterranean. Was it though? Can this be true, or is it possible that the real
meaning of the story could have been lost during the original translation from
ancient Greek to English? </p>
<p>Before
analyzing the text below, those not familiar with Greek, must be reminded that the syntactic structure of the language that Plato used has a very
different structure than the English language we often use to translate it. What
often seems strange to those who first try to learn Greek is the inversion of
the possessive adjective in respect to the noun.  Similarly, text inversions like these may
also exist in the sequence of entire sentences. For
example, in an independent clause, an item which is stressed, i.e. which is
uttered with emphasis or is contrastive, in ancient Greek it generally goes at
the beginning of the clause, rarely at the end. Middle position is occupied by
an item receiving no particular emphasis. In a series of clauses in a sentence, though, as in the translated passage below, a prominent item goes at the beginning of its clause if it relates to the previous context, and at the end if it relates to the following one (look at first sentence of the first paragraph, and the last sentence of the second one).</p>
<blockquote>
<b>
<i>For it is related in our records how once upon a time your State stayed
the course of a mighty host, </i><i>which, starting from a distant
point in the Atlantic ocean, was insolently advancing to attack the whole of
Europe, and Asia to boot.<br/></i><i>(For) the Ocean
that was at that time navigable; for in front of the mouth which you Greeks
call, as you say “the Pillars of Heracles” [Strait of Gibraltar] there lay an
island which was larger than Libya and Asia together; <span>and
it was possible for travelers of that time to cross from it to the other
islands and from the islands to the whole of the continent over against them
which encompasses the veritable ocean ...</span></i></b>
</blockquote>
<p><b></b></p>
<p>In this case, and contrary to what many automatically assume, Plato does
not point to the direction of Atlantis across the ocean. As explained earlier,
the phrase <i>“your state stayed the course of a mighty host”</i>, at the beginning of
the clause, is where the emphasis should be placed. While in this part Plato
reveals the very close proximity of Atlantis to Greece, in the rest of the
sentence he poetically describes the might of Atlantis and its capacity that
stretched around the world to a “distant point” and another continent across
the ocean. Of course, once he illustrates their incredible capability, he then
describes their audacious and warlike character and their plans to “advance
against the whole Europe and Asia”. </p>
<p>The same rule applies when analyzing the remaining
text. In this case the revelation of a continent across the ocean is not where
the emphasis should be placed. As explained earlier, in a series of clauses in
a sentence, prominent items usually are either placed at the beginning or at
the end of their clause. The middle part of a sentence is occupied by items
that should receive less emphasis. According to this rule, and in this
particular case, the explanation of how Atlantians were able to reach the
continent across the ocean, at the end of the clause, is where the emphasis should
be placed and not on the continent itself that is mentioned earlier (the part that
many automatically are drawn to). Not knowing where the emphasis on a clause
should be placed, can cause a great deal of confusion, as often and depending
where the emphasis goes, two separate meanings can emerge out of a single paragraph.
Actually, when it comes to ancient Greek, sometimes even a single comma can
cause a short sentence to have two different meanings. Such example is a famous
quote from the oracle of Delphi. <i>""Go,
return not die in war"", </i>can have two entirely
opposite meanings, depending on where a missing comma is supposed to be -
before or after - the word ""not"".</p>
<p>In short, when a story from ancient Greek is translated to English, the
translated sentences may require proper ""re-positioning"" in order for
an English reader to make better sense of it. For instance, when understanding
the syntactic structure of the Greek language and how to ""read it""
correctly, Plato’s second paragraph above, to an English reader should appear
as follows:</p>
<blockquote><b><i><b><i>(For) the Ocean that was at that time navigable; </i></b> and it was possible for travelers of that
time to cross from it (from Atlantis) to the other islands, and from
these islands to the whole of the continent over against them which encompasses
the veritable ocean....  for in front of
the mouth which you Greeks call, as you say “the Pillars of Hercules,” there
lay a continent which was larger than Libya and Asia together. </i></b></blockquote>
<p><b></b></p>
<p>When
seen in this context, the continent across the ocean is no longer the place of
origin for Atlantians, but a destination. Here, Plato simply describes the
might of Atlantis by depicting their incredible capability to travel half way around the world. He explains that via island hopping (most likely from Scotland, to the Faroe Islands, to Iceland and then to
Greenland),
the Atlantians were able to reach another grand island/continent on
the other side of the Atlantic, one across from the ""Pillars of
Hercules"". Which other continent is on the opposite side of the Atlantic
across from the Strait of Gibraltar? The American continent, of course! It was
the American continent that Plato said was larger than Libya and Asia put
together and not that of Atlantis, as many wrongly had interpreted and even to
this day continue to interpret. </p>
<p>Those unconvinced that the ancient Greeks could have
known of the American continent around the 4th century BC, must be reminded
that unlike other European civilizations at the time, not only did the Greeks know
of the continent across the ocean but they were also aware that the earth is round
and not flat. The Antikythera mechanism is a technological testament of that advanced
knowledge. Additional evidence though, point that more ancient cultures during
that period may have been aware of the continent across the ocean. Piri Reis, a
Turkish admiral and a famous cartographer (1465-1553) repeatedly claimed that
his controversial maps which showed the American continent, and some say
Antarctica (300 years before its discovery by the Europeans), were actually
based on ancient maps dating from the 4th century BC. Additionally, a recent
discovery of a Carthaginian coin which depicts a world map (circa 350 BC) also demonstrates
that at around the 4th century BC not only Plato and the Greeks may have been
aware of the American continent, but others did as well.</p>
<p>By the way, when altogether discarding Plato's claim,
that 10 millennia ago a prehistoric civilization from the Mediterranean travelled
to North America via island hopping, how do we otherwise explain the migration
of haplogroup X in the region of the Great Lakes, 10,000 years ago? (For those not
familiar with mtDNA studies, while all Native Indians in America were expected
to carry the four Asian haplogroups, A,B,C &amp; D, some tribes around the
Great Lakes were found to also carry haplogroup X, a gene that originates from
the eastern Mediterranean). And, without Plato's explanation in place, how else
do we explain that high traces of haplogroup X also happen to exist in  Scotland, Faroe Islands, and Iceland,
essentially all the island stops to North America from Europe? </p>
<p>Those who support the Solutrean/ Clovis hypothesis (a migration
via a partial ice sheet over the Atlantic), how do they explain that out of at
least a dozen haplogroups present in northern Europe at the
time (H, V, J, HV, U, T, UK, X, W, and I) only a single one managed the trip to
North America, when on the opposite site, every one of the 4 Asian haplogroups
sequentially followed each other over the Bering Strait?</p>
<p>As for those who support the hypothesis that haplogroup X migrated to the Great Lakes
on foot via the Bering Strait, along with haplogroups A,B,C &amp; D, how do they
explain that there is no trace of haplogroup X to fill in the huge void between
southern Russia and the Great Lakes of North America?  Most importantly, though, if haplogroup X
migrated to America via the Bering Strait, how do we explain that the heaviest
concentration of haplogroup X, away from the eastern Mediterranean, exist on
the east coast of the United States, around the Great Lakes, and not in Alaska
or the west coast? Is it time perhaps to give Plato's story another closer
look? </p>
<p>Finally, in regards to the critics who will remind you that Atlantis was entirely
swallowed by the sea, while obviously in this case remnants of it were left
behind, in the following paragraph Plato clarifies this flawed belief.</p>
<blockquote><b><i>The consequence
is, that in comparison of what then was, there are remaining in small islets
only the bones of the wasted body, as they may be called, all the richer and
softer parts of the soil having fallen away, and the mere skeleton of the
country being left.</i></b></blockquote>

well as marine archaeologists looking for ancient wood vessels that may be
broken up and decomposing. Scanning the sea (between 50-350 feet in depth) near

""Hello! My name is Christos A. Djonis.
I am the author of the recently released book ""Uchronia? Atlantis
Revealed,"" and the producer of the upcoming feature-length documentary, ""Atlantis
Revealed!"".
Before discussing further the upcoming
film, first and foremost, I must confess that when I first started the research
for my latest book (more of a passion project that touches on several controversial
topics), I never in a million years thought I'd be able to locate a site that in
every way will match Plato's Atlantis. Even later, more than two years into the
project, when eventually all clues brought me to look for Atlantis within the
Mediterranean Sea, still, in all honesty I was not sure where to look for it.
I remember thinking, if Plato's given
chronology on Atlantis coincided with the rise of the oceans at the end of the
last Ice Age, then, this island could have gotten lost during the rapid rise of
the Mediterranean,  just prior to the
flooding of the Black Sea and roughly 10,000 years ago. If so, then Plato's
lost island should only be 400 feet beneath the waves and not few miles deep, as
some researchers theorized in the past. 
The search was lengthy, challenging, and
at times I felt it would never come to fruition. Even when I spotted my first
real clue, an underwater plateau around the Cyclades Islands, I did not fully
understand the significance of the find until several hours later, when I was
able to outline its entire shape. Only then I realized that the submerged
super-island I just found, formed by the Cyclades Plateau, perfectly matched
Plato's description Atlantis. The chronology, every physical aspect of the
topography, the volcanic geology, the flora and fauna in that period, the
island's destruction by a ""great flood"", archaeological remnants of an
unknown prehistoric civilization in the immediate area, all pointed to a genuine
discovery. And that was not all"".


I INVITE YOU TO CONNECT WITH US AND SUPPORT THE MAKING OF THE DOCUMENTARY THAT WILL FINALLY UNRAVEL PLATO'S TWO THOUSAND-YEAR-OLD- PUZZLE!
Why
look for Atlantis in the Mediterranean Sea and not in the Atlantic Ocean? What was
the large island/ continent Plato mentioned across the Atlantic? Is it possible
that remnants of Atlantis were left behind?
 For
answers to these and other questions, please look for ""Uchronia? Atlantis
Revealed"", the book behind the upcoming documentary (available at Amazon and major booksellers around the world).



The Book
At
around 360 BC, in his dialogues of Timaeus and Critias, the Greek philosopher
Plato introduced an incredible story, a tale of an enigmatic island civilization
which since captivated the imagination of every generation that followed. This
was the story of Atlantis, one of the most advanced societies of the ancient
world, a prehistoric civilization capable of crossing the Atlantic Ocean more
than 10,000 years ago. 
Today,
regardless of the many archaeological discoveries which support Plato's claim of
such advanced culture (like that of Gobekli Tepe in Turkey, the Lost city of
Ubar in the Arabian Peninsula, the submerged city off the coast of west India
in the Gulf of Cambay, and others), many skeptics choose to point to the several
inconsistencies in Plato's story (like Athens or Egypt did not exist ten
millennia ago, when according to Plato the story took place) and quickly label
Atlantis as a myth. Are the skeptics correct though?
Just
as in the case of Atlantis, for several centuries we thought that the city of
Troy, the centerpiece in Homer’s epic saga, was also a myth. All that changed
obviously when Heinrich Schliemann, an amateur archaeologist, found Troy in
1868 while following location tips from Homer’s book Iliad. In the case of
Troy, after ditching all the details regarding beauty queens, demigods, Trojan
horses and scaled back the armies to more rational levels, it was ultimately
acknowledged by the scientific community that the setting as well as the bulk
of this story was real. Essentially, Homer’s entirely fictional story, which he
filled with principles and common elements from his own time, apparently
revolved around a tangible setting and a real incident which took place nearly
six centuries before his time. Of course, Troy is not an isolated example. Our
recorded history is full of stories that contain serious discrepancies and
circumstances where once mythological places, or ""fairy tales"", in
the end turned out to be true!
So, a fundamental question remains. Was
Atlantis simply a cautionary tale or is it possible Plato crafted a tale based
on a real setting and a prehistoric civilization known to ancient Greeks, while
he supplemented all the “modern” details as Homer did few hundred years before
him?
If true, as
in the case of Troy, the true-part of this story should not rest in the story
plot, but in the detection and authentication of Plato’s “lost island.” 
Locating a matching site, along with signs of
an advanced civilization in the immediate area, should be the first step in
solving this mystery.
Indeed, a recent discovery of a sunken island
that perfectly matches Plato's Atlantis, found in the right period as well as
the right location (more on the location later), if anything, it further
suggests that Plato based his story on real a prehistoric civilization, which
in order to successfully communicate some of his philosophical ideas (divine
vs. human, ideal societies vs. corrupt,) he filled with familiar matter and
details from later times. 
So, unlike earlier theories and faulty interpretations
of the story which place Atlantis all over the Atlantic Ocean, in Spain, off
the coast of Cyprus, at the Azores Islands, in Antarctica and other places (without
ever offering a matching site), the recent discovery shows that Plato's
Atlantis was a prehistoric super-island in the Aegean Sea at the doorstep of
Greece, and not in some far-away location. Even when setting aside all the other
clues that lead to the same conclusion, Plato's
own words “your State (Greece) stayed the
course of a mighty host,” clearly suggests that Atlantis, as a “host” of
mainland Greece, stood at Greece's doorstep and ultimately controlled the path,
or better yet, the waters leading into the Aegean Sea. True enough! As it turns out, ten
millennia ago, with sea levels lower by 400 feet, the modern day Cyclades
Islands were connected by a flat terrain, today known as the ""Cyclades
Plateau"". This massive plateau formed a super-island that when comparing
to Atlantis, in every way it matches Plato's description (see Plato's quotation
and image below). If Atlantis was ever real, this must have been the place
Plato was talking about. Not only the geography is identical, the volcanic
geology is there, but when further comparing to Plato's account, the flora and
fauna, including elephants, chronologically match the topography. How is this
possible? To be able to locate a place that slightly resembles Plato’s Atlantis is
extremely difficult, to produce one where all the physical aspects perfectly
match, is virtually impossible, unless of course the proposed site is the real
thing. When up
until today, to prove Atlantis real, the most difficult task was to find a place
that matched Plato's description, now that we have such a place, how can
skeptics explain this finding away? Not only we now have a matching site but
relics from an unknown pre-Bronze civilization in the immediate area further
reinforce this discovery. 

An island
comprising mostly of mountains in the northern portions and along the shore,
and encompassing a great plain of an oblong shape in the south extending in one
direction three thousand stadia (about 555 square kilometers), but across the
center island it was two thousand stadia (about 370 square kilometers). Fifty
stadia (9km) from the coast was a mountain that was low on all sides…broke it
off all round about . . . the central island itself was five stades in diameter
(about 0.92 km).

1600BC, based on a 1991 study by Druitt and Francaviglia (Right).
Of course, as skeptics often do, without ever attempting to explain
away the matching site, many will quickly point that according to Plato (see Plato's
text below) Atlantis was somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean and not in the
Mediterranean. Was it though? Can this be true, or is it possible that the real
meaning of the story could have been lost during the original translation from
ancient Greek to English? 
Before
analyzing the text below, those not familiar with Greek, must be reminded that the syntactic structure of the language that Plato used has a very
different structure than the English language we often use to translate it. What
often seems strange to those who first try to learn Greek is the inversion of
the possessive adjective in respect to the noun.  Similarly, text inversions like these may
also exist in the sequence of entire sentences. For
example, in an independent clause, an item which is stressed, i.e. which is
uttered with emphasis or is contrastive, in ancient Greek it generally goes at
the beginning of the clause, rarely at the end. Middle position is occupied by
an item receiving no particular emphasis. In a series of clauses in a sentence, though, as in the translated passage below, a prominent item goes at the beginning of its clause if it relates to the previous context, and at the end if it relates to the following one (look at first sentence of the first paragraph, and the last sentence of the second one).


For it is related in our records how once upon a time your State stayed
the course of a mighty host, which, starting from a distant
point in the Atlantic ocean, was insolently advancing to attack the whole of
Europe, and Asia to boot.(For) the Ocean
that was at that time navigable; for in front of the mouth which you Greeks
call, as you say “the Pillars of Heracles” [Strait of Gibraltar] there lay an
island which was larger than Libya and Asia together; and
it was possible for travelers of that time to cross from it to the other
islands and from the islands to the whole of the continent over against them
which encompasses the veritable ocean ...


In this case, and contrary to what many automatically assume, Plato does
not point to the direction of Atlantis across the ocean. As explained earlier,
the phrase “your state stayed the course of a mighty host”, at the beginning of
the clause, is where the emphasis should be placed. While in this part Plato
reveals the very close proximity of Atlantis to Greece, in the rest of the
sentence he poetically describes the might of Atlantis and its capacity that
stretched around the world to a “distant point” and another continent across
the ocean. Of course, once he illustrates their incredible capability, he then
describes their audacious and warlike character and their plans to “advance
against the whole Europe and Asia”. 
The same rule applies when analyzing the remaining
text. In this case the revelation of a continent across the ocean is not where
the emphasis should be placed. As explained earlier, in a series of clauses in
a sentence, prominent items usually are either placed at the beginning or at
the end of their clause. The middle part of a sentence is occupied by items
that should receive less emphasis. According to this rule, and in this
particular case, the explanation of how Atlantians were able to reach the
continent across the ocean, at the end of the clause, is where the emphasis should
be placed and not on the continent itself that is mentioned earlier (the part that
many automatically are drawn to). Not knowing where the emphasis on a clause
should be placed, can cause a great deal of confusion, as often and depending
where the emphasis goes, two separate meanings can emerge out of a single paragraph.
Actually, when it comes to ancient Greek, sometimes even a single comma can
cause a short sentence to have two different meanings. Such example is a famous
quote from the oracle of Delphi. ""Go,
return not die in war"", can have two entirely
opposite meanings, depending on where a missing comma is supposed to be -
before or after - the word ""not"".
In short, when a story from ancient Greek is translated to English, the
translated sentences may require proper ""re-positioning"" in order for
an English reader to make better sense of it. For instance, when understanding
the syntactic structure of the Greek language and how to ""read it""
correctly, Plato’s second paragraph above, to an English reader should appear
as follows:
(For) the Ocean that was at that time navigable;  and it was possible for travelers of that
time to cross from it (from Atlantis) to the other islands, and from
these islands to the whole of the continent over against them which encompasses
the veritable ocean....  for in front of
the mouth which you Greeks call, as you say “the Pillars of Hercules,” there
lay a continent which was larger than Libya and Asia together. 

When
seen in this context, the continent across the ocean is no longer the place of
origin for Atlantians, but a destination. Here, Plato simply describes the
might of Atlantis by depicting their incredible capability to travel half way around the world. He explains that via island hopping (most likely from Scotland, to the Faroe Islands, to Iceland and then to
Greenland),
the Atlantians were able to reach another grand island/continent on
the other side of the Atlantic, one across from the ""Pillars of
Hercules"". Which other continent is on the opposite side of the Atlantic
across from the Strait of Gibraltar? The American continent, of course! It was
the American continent that Plato said was larger than Libya and Asia put
together and not that of Atlantis, as many wrongly had interpreted and even to
this day continue to interpret. 
Those unconvinced that the ancient Greeks could have
known of the American continent around the 4th century BC, must be reminded
that unlike other European civilizations at the time, not only did the Greeks know
of the continent across the ocean but they were also aware that the earth is round
and not flat. The Antikythera mechanism is a technological testament of that advanced
knowledge. Additional evidence though, point that more ancient cultures during
that period may have been aware of the continent across the ocean. Piri Reis, a
Turkish admiral and a famous cartographer (1465-1553) repeatedly claimed that
his controversial maps which showed the American continent, and some say
Antarctica (300 years before its discovery by the Europeans), were actually
based on ancient maps dating from the 4th century BC. Additionally, a recent
discovery of a Carthaginian coin which depicts a world map (circa 350 BC) also demonstrates
that at around the 4th century BC not only Plato and the Greeks may have been
aware of the American continent, but others did as well.
By the way, when altogether discarding Plato's claim,
that 10 millennia ago a prehistoric civilization from the Mediterranean travelled
to North America via island hopping, how do we otherwise explain the migration
of haplogroup X in the region of the Great Lakes, 10,000 years ago? (For those not
familiar with mtDNA studies, while all Native Indians in America were expected
to carry the four Asian haplogroups, A,B,C & D, some tribes around the
Great Lakes were found to also carry haplogroup X, a gene that originates from
the eastern Mediterranean). And, without Plato's explanation in place, how else
do we explain that high traces of haplogroup X also happen to exist in  Scotland, Faroe Islands, and Iceland,
essentially all the island stops to North America from Europe? 
Those who support the Solutrean/ Clovis hypothesis (a migration
via a partial ice sheet over the Atlantic), how do they explain that out of at
least a dozen haplogroups present in northern Europe at the
time (H, V, J, HV, U, T, UK, X, W, and I) only a single one managed the trip to
North America, when on the opposite site, every one of the 4 Asian haplogroups
sequentially followed each other over the Bering Strait?
As for those who support the hypothesis that haplogroup X migrated to the Great Lakes
on foot via the Bering Strait, along with haplogroups A,B,C & D, how do they
explain that there is no trace of haplogroup X to fill in the huge void between
southern Russia and the Great Lakes of North America?  Most importantly, though, if haplogroup X
migrated to America via the Bering Strait, how do we explain that the heaviest
concentration of haplogroup X, away from the eastern Mediterranean, exist on
the east coast of the United States, around the Great Lakes, and not in Alaska
or the west coast? Is it time perhaps to give Plato's story another closer
look? 
Finally, in regards to the critics who will remind you that Atlantis was entirely
swallowed by the sea, while obviously in this case remnants of it were left
behind, in the following paragraph Plato clarifies this flawed belief.
The consequence
is, that in comparison of what then was, there are remaining in small islets
only the bones of the wasted body, as they may be called, all the richer and

The Project
Your
contribution will assist in producing ""Atlantis Revealed"", the pilot documentary
in a series that will help unravel some of the most contentious mysteries of
our time!

Most
every previous claim about the discovery of Atlantis, has produced NO tangible evidence. Unlike past failures on the subject, this documentary will establish the following:








Proper translation and analysis of Plato's account,
places Atlantis in the Mediterranean, at the doorstep of Greece, and not in the
Atlantic Ocean, or in some exotic location as many researchers previously
thought.


A thorough look for Atlantis in the Mediterranean
ultimately revealed a prehistoric super-island (now 400 feet below sea level) that
in every way matches Plato's description.  


Around the 4th century BC, Plato and the ancient Greeks
were fully aware of the American continent across the Atlantic. In effect, the
continent across the Atlantic Plato mentioned in his story, was the American
continent and not that of Atlantis.


Past mtDNA studies, which confirmed the existence of a
Mediterranean gene (haplogroup X) among certain American Indian tribes around
the Great Lakes, not only corroborate Plato's claim of an advanced prehistoric civilization
10,000 years ago, capable crossing the Atlantic, but these tests further reinforce
our conclusion that this advanced culture originated in the eastern Mediterranean.  


High traces of haplogroup X in Scotland, Faroe Islands,
Iceland, and ultimately around the Great Lakes of North America, also validate that
these ""Atlantians"" (or whatever that civilization was called) visited
North America from the Atlantic side via ""island hopping"" and just as
Plato claimed.


Our research will reveal that the super-island of the
Cyclades Plateau, otherwise known as Atlantis, was drowned by the sea at around
8000 BC, during the rapid rise of the Mediterranean and just prior to the
flooding of the Black Sea (See UNESCO study of 2009 regards to the Black Sea Flood
-- See also global flooding caused by Glacial Lake Agassiz -- Read Science News
article, 2010: ""Global Sea-Level Rise at the end of the Last Ice-Age,
Interrupted by Rapid Jumps"".)


Contrary to a common belief that Atlantis vanished from
the face of the Earth, Plato's own account reveals that remnants of Atlantis
remained behind and formed small islets, just as in the case of the Cyclades
Plateau.


While several archaeological artifacts around the
Cyclades islands point to some unknown pre-bronze age civilization in the area,
we must now establish whether these artifacts are the recovering remnants of
another slightly older civilization, one that could relate to Plato's Atlantis.


Finally, the discovery of a matching site in the given
chronology, confirms past scientific speculations that Plato created a moral fable
around a real setting in which, in order to successfully communicate some of
his philosophical ideas, he filled with familiar matter and details from his
own time, just as Homer did 400 years earlier with the city of Troy. 



____________________________________________________________________________



FACTOID: Did
you know the scientific community came close to solve this mystery in the past?
It
is well known fact that other researchers and archaeologists in the past
suggested that Santorini could have been the spot where the crown city of
Atlantis once stood. Unfortunately for them though, since they did not believe
that Plato's story could have taken place 10,000 years ago, they discarded
Plato's given chronology of 9600 BC, and concentrated their study during the
Minoan era, and closer to the time when the Santorini volcano erupted, around
1600 BC. 
A
huge problem with their ""partial discovery"" however, was that without
the primary island of Atlantis nearby, Santorini alone did not match with Plato's
entire description. This allowed for critics in the past to reject the
particular proposal and continue to question the validity of Plato's story. 

In other words, although archaeologists came close to solve this mystery in the past, apparently they did not
come close enough, since they never were able to produce a matching site to
Plato's Atlantis. As it now appears, looking for Atlantis in the right
chronology, was always the right key to unlock this mystery.

The Budget 


""Atlantis
Revealed"" will be filmed primarily on location around the Mediterranean and the
Cyclades Islands. 
Our
tight budget of $290,000 must be met prior to production. Every dollar
collected will be reinvested into the project, either producing the film or
making and shipping the perks. 
If our minimum target is not met, this will obviously cause temporary production delays. In that case, the production will resume once additional funding is obtained and our minimum required budget is met. Excess funding on the other hand, will allow for
additional research prior to production, add special effects, and improve
production quality. The more money we raise, the more talent we can attract,
and bigger and better the project becomes. 
Help Make it Happen!
WHERE THE MONEY GOES:

Wait, Got More to offer! $375,000 STRETCH GOAL

At
the $375,000 mark, anyone who previously selected a perk worth $50 and up, in
addition to their regular perk, will also receive a DVD copy of this Documentary. 
At
this level, we should be able to fund an underwater exploration with the use of
a ""side scan sonar"". Our scanning depth of less than 400 feet, should
allow us to use a high frequency side scan that produces an excellent
resolution at shallow depths. A high frequency sonar picks up everything that
the low frequency sonar does (manmade structures, walls, houses), plus small
and soft targets like a vase, a small statue, skeletal remains, etc. High
frequency side scan sonars are popular with law enforcement, wreck hunters, as
well as marine archaeologists looking for ancient wood vessels that may be
broken up and decomposing. Scanning the sea (between 50-350 feet in depth) near
areas where prehistoric artifacts were previously found on land, as well as the
seabed between the islands of Naxos, Sikinos, Antiparos and Irakleia, surveying
for underwater ruins and other structures (like Plato's famous water
canals), may turn out to be extremely beneficial to our project. 
Please
share this link and promote our project to friends and family. Every new donor you
help bring aboard, adds to the success of this project. 
If possible, we would really
love to have 60,000 backers, even at $5 each. By the way, let's not forget that
film distributors love big crowds too.

<div style=""text-align: left;""><b>1/ What happens if you don't make it? </b></div>
<div>= Once started we will stay on the Journey however long it takes to complete...</div>
<div style=""text-align: left;""><b>2/ What happens if you don't raise enough funds for the Bare Basic Journey?</b></div>
<div>= As long as we can get started - even if we have to film, stop, work, film, stop &amp; work our way all the way North - we will complete the Journey no matter what:-)...</div>
<div style=""text-align: left;""><b>3/ Why are you taking Dogs? You can't get into National Parks?</b></div>
<div>= Our Rose &amp; Lexi are part of our family pack &amp; want them to go where we go, we also want to show you many incredible experiences &amp; areas off the tourist trail… I believe many people want to travel with dogs &amp; I think things need to change...</div>
<div style=""text-align: left;""><b>4/ Are the Post Cards real or Electronic? &amp; are they sent from that town?</b></div>
<div>= Yes, the Post Cards are REAL printed ones:-) written &amp; mailed from that town…</div>
<div style=""text-align: left;""><b>5/ What happens if 'Big Red' breaks down or you get hopelessly bogged?</b></div>
<div>= Let's hope not:-), but we do have emergency funds for a breakdown &amp; recovery, &amp; we have winches, snatch straps, air jack, track mats &amp; a good old shovel:-)…</div>
<div style=""text-align: left;""><b>6/ Do you sleep in a tent, or in the back of 'Big Red', what about Crocs?</b></div>
<div>= Good question! We sleep in our trusty old Swag on the ground in the open or under the side awning or tent sometimes &amp; the dogs have their own bed in the back of the truck, if in crocodile country we also sleep in 'Big Red' with the dogs…</div>
<div style=""text-align: left;""><b>7/ Why are you attempting 2 of the most feared off road 4x4 obstacles in Australia? Isn't that a little crazy - couldn't you damage 'Big Red'…?</b></div>
<div>= Yes, that's right we are attempting both the Notorious Gunshot Creek Crossing &amp; actually attempting to FORD the (170m wide crocodile Infested) Jardine River,</div>
<div> = Why? I have unfinished business to complete - I declined to do both of these on my 12 month lap of Australia last visit up the Tip of Cape York &amp; need to attempt them both &amp; many people believe it cannot be done in 'Big Red' :-) let's see!...</div>

I've had a ridiculous passion for this Big Red Ute… 
And have just
spent the last 4 years rebuilding
this old girl.

 A 'Big Red' Journey - Across the Continent of
Australia!

F100 4x4
_________

'Across Australia'… with A Man, His Ute & His Dog!



#thejourneymantv 


Buying 'Big Red' on eBay in a moment of madness was the 1st thing I did when going through a divorce a few years ago, the 2nd thing was to  rescue Rose from the Dog Pound & the 3rd was to meet Louise & Lexi… 

I met 'Lady Louise' quite literally by chance on the main street of Bowral NSW… I believe the reason we met was to film this Real Outback Aussie Adventure!



Rose & Lexi became best mates & were ready for a Road Trip...




So we ALL completed 'The Birdsville Track in 'Big Red'' & loved it - & thought YOU  & many others around the world would love to experience this also…  
- so we decided to take YOU with us - through the eye of our camera! 

Louise & 'Big Red' on the famous Birdsville Track heading for the Races...


  


We've now decided to drive & film 'Across Australia' in 'Big Red' our  beat up looking 36 yr old F100 4x4… Crazy we know, we've been told!


The planned Journey 'Across Australia' - it really is a hell of a long way -

- But Achievable & Believable… just 1 km at a time - thanks to You!
This North/South Journey 'Across Australia' is huge - 4,580 km's !



Our goal is basically a MASSIVE' Road Trip - 'Across Australia' - as you can see - from way down at the Southern most point of Australia at Wilson's Promontory  to the Far Northern most Tip of Australia - 'Cape York Peninsular' 
We cross Mountains, Deserts, Croc Infested Rivers, Camp under the Stars in a Swag, Cook over Campfires & film everything that happens along the way!
___________________

Why on earth would we do such a Challenging, Old Style Camping & Fishing Journey with Swags, Dogs & Campfires driving - 'Big Red' our beat up looking F100 4x4?



To show you it can be done!!! & you can come along with us…

We're doing it Old School - bringing back the memories of simple times on the road,  fishing & camping & kayaking along with our #journeydogs in 'Big Red'… 


 

#journeydogs & Louise kayak across the flooded Birdsville Track... 





Can we make it in 'Big Red'? I hope so & with your support I think we can do it!


We need to raise $4.44 per km to make this happen...
# Just $10 can help us so much… another couple km's further  & gets you on our 'Funders Wall of Fame' or pick another Perk that you would like…
                                                                                                                                          The Dogs are ready to go:-) their waiting to leave!



 



If successful with this Journey, then it's a dream come true & we will have YOU to thank for that… who knows it may just be the start of  a few more

…


10 'Journeys Across Australia' could be on the cards if we succeed… 

                                                                       


We have spent 3 full years, every minute & every dollar put into in the planning, paying, rebuilding, dreaming & hoping stages & finally ready to roll:-) 




------------------------       

We need YOUR help now to start the film rolling… 
Just $10 can help so so much… another few km's further - thank you!

Expenses... 


Intitial funding covers our most Basic Bare Bones Expenses on this North/South Journey - 'Across Australia'… 



Our initial goal is to raise $20,333 - this is $4.44 per km North…  a grand total of 4,580km North - but we will in fact cover 4 times that - 18,320 km's cutting a swath of 300km wide, often crabbing 100km sideways filming interesting points. 


# Basic Bare Bones Expenses covered below… & equate to $4.44 km

This 2nd list above is our wish list to make life & filming on the road much easier & with better equipment for filming, safety, & comfort with a better shelter… & gear & comes in at $10 per km…  we may be very lucky & reach this stretch target...




You need a backup of the backup of the backup - that's my motto anyway!
Just like - Water, Tyres & Fuel  - or know how to sort it…


Heading West across The Old Strezlecki Track...





No rest for the wicked...

We will be spending about 12 weeks, 12 hours a Day on the road filming & photographing & gathering ALL the raw material we need to produce the 6 part TV Series of the North South Crossing & believe me - experience tells us we will be working our backsides off from 1st light - way into the night sorting, downloading, processing, planning, documenting & logging, recharging & replacing + cleaning to name just a few commitments of our Life on the Road for that 3 months…


Oh, & did I mention filming constantly for 10 hrs a day:-)

But I love it… & is my passion to showcase Outback Australia!

RISKS & CHALLENGES…



# This is not a simple Road Trip Across Australia - it will take a lot of… 



- Planning - Strategy - Roadworthy Vehicle - 3 months of living in a Swag -

- Weather Conditions - Heat - Dust - Wind - Rain - Flies - Insects - Cold -

- Weather Conditions - Road Conditions - Communications & Safety Solutions -

- Maps - GPS Systems - Laptops & iPads - Camera's - Drone  & Film Equipment -  

- Dog Restriction Awareness - Nat Parks - Crossing Rivers - Mountains - Forests -   


- Outback Australia - Townships - People - Crocodiles - Fishing - Camping - Snakes -

- Anything & Everything…


# Above are some of the Risks & Challenges & Issues we will face… but these can all be managed & minimised… let's see how we go!


We will show you how to do that!!! or not to do - if we mess up!

My personal experience of many years travelling & camping Across Australia will stand us in good stead & since I am a simple bloke who really doesn't like complicated sorts of things - that's the type of solutions & lessons you will learn off us doing this - Journey Across Australia - in 'Big Red'


Frequently Asked Questions…?

1/ What happens if you don't make it? 
= Once started we will stay on the Journey however long it takes to complete...
2/ What happens if you don't raise enough funds for the Bare Basic Journey?
= As long as we can get started - even if we have to film, stop, work, film, stop & work our way all the way North - we will complete the Journey no matter what:-)...
3/ Why are you taking Dogs? You can't get into National Parks?
= Our Rose & Lexi are part of our family pack & want them to go where we go, we also want to show you many incredible experiences & areas off the tourist trail… I believe many people want to travel with dogs & I think things need to change...
4/ Are the Post Cards real or Electronic? & are they sent from that town?
= Yes, the Post Cards are REAL printed ones:-) written & mailed from that town…
5/ What happens if 'Big Red' breaks down or you get hopelessly bogged?
= Let's hope not:-), but we do have emergency funds for a breakdown & recovery, & we have winches, snatch straps, air jack, track mats & a good old shovel:-)…
6/ Do you sleep in a tent, or in the back of 'Big Red', what about Crocs?
= Good question! We sleep in our trusty old Swag on the ground in the open or under the side awning or tent sometimes & the dogs have their own bed in the back of the truck, if in crocodile country we also sleep in 'Big Red' with the dogs…
7/ Why are you attempting 2 of the most feared off road 4x4 obstacles in Australia? Isn't that a little crazy - couldn't you damage 'Big Red'…?
= Yes, that's right we are attempting both the Notorious Gunshot Creek Crossing & actually attempting to FORD the (170m wide crocodile Infested) Jardine River,
 = Why? I have unfinished business to complete - I declined to do both of these on my 12 month lap of Australia last visit up the Tip of Cape York & need to attempt them both & many people believe it cannot be done in 'Big Red' :-) let's see!...

Atormentado por los fantasmas de su pasado, intentará escapar hacia el mundo exterior, pero un terrible secreto saldrá a la luz para impedir su salida. Jack tendrá que luchar con todas sus fuerzas para conseguir huir de ese maldito lugar y también de si mismo.

Jack, a weak old man, lives in seclusion in a dark and gloomy underground chapel. Haunted by the ghosts of his past, he’ll try to scape to the outside world, but a terrible secret will come out to prevent his departure. Jack will have to fight with all his strenght in order to escape not only from that wretched place but also from himself.













Condamned es un cortometraje de terror de unos 10 min de duración en el que pretendemos sumergir al espectador, en un viaje claustrofóbico y oscuro, donde los miedos y la ambición humana, se darán cita, en una atmósfera diabólica de terror gótico.


Nos trasladamos al Londres de finales del siglo XIX, sumido en plena decadencia victoriana,  donde encontramos a un Jack viejo y débil, encerrado en la capilla de su gran mansión. Jack intentará salir de su propia prisión personal, pero su plan se verá amenazado por  unas presencias que le recordarán sus fantasmas del pasado. 


Condamned es un corto pero intenso viaje hacia la redención del ser humano  y la oscuridad que lo envuelve.



Condamned is an horror short film that lasts about 10 min. in which we want to immerse the viewer in a dark and claustrophobic journey where fears and human ambition will meet in a diabolical atmosphere of gothic horror.


Set in the late nineteenth century London, plunged in full Victorian decadence, we find a weak ald Jack locked in the chapel of his large mansion. He’ll try to leave his own personal prison but his plan will be threatened by a presence that will remind him of his past ghosts.


Condamned is a short but intense journey towards the human redemption and the darkness that surrounds it.

We seek $15k to make DVDs of the 19-minute documentary Racing with Copepods, including 10 short educational films using leftover footage from the documentary - all for schools and libraries. Your contribution is tax-deductible. 
The 10 supplementary films we want to create are each of 2-5 minutes.  Along with the documentary, they form a substantial and entertaining educational package for school children and adults. The films will help teachers engage students and promote place-based learning, environmental awareness, and ocean literacy. 
The topics are:

San Francisco Bay: How wind and currents occur there, its uniqueness

Chert: What it is, how it formed, where it’s from, where you can see it 

Trash: When we throw something away, where is “away""?
Protecting The Ocean: What we can do to protect our waters
Learn To Sail: Technique, lessons, knots
Marshes: How the marshes act as kidneys, cleaning our waters
Dr Sylvia Earle: Lessons from her talk with the youth of RWC
Copepods & The Lucky Luke Effect: How impossibly fast they are
Extended interviews with the youth sailors of RWC 

Questionnaires: The RWC youth report with answers they got from adults to questions like: Where does most of our oxygen originate? How much of the ocean floor have we mapped? Where are most of the species on Earth?  What is the most populous animal on the planet? And the fastest?

<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Receive</h3>Three years ago, through Indiegogo, we successfully raised $23,115 out of the <b>$35,000</b> we initially needed for the barebones production of <b><a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/campaigns/a-force-in-nature/edit/vimeo.com/40509786"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">A Force in Nature</a></b>. Thanks to the generous contributions we received from people everywhere, we were able to send a small crew (myself and a camera assistant) to Iceland and film non-stop for almost three 
weeks, capturing some of the most spectacular landscapes we've ever seen and meet with some of the most colorful characters that knew Johann intimately. Since then we have been working on and off editing
 the project, on our own time and resources.
<p>We want to raise an additional <strong>$25,700</strong> for the last part 
of the production which would 
help us assemble all of the necessary elements we captured in Iceland and Texas and put the finishing touches to it. Here is the breakdown of what we are looking for in terms of 
support:</p>
<p>This is for editing and other post-production elements for the film:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Finishing Fee Post production - $10,500 (assistant editors, color grading)<br/>
</li>
<li>Music rights fee - composers and musicians - $3,000</li>
<li>Stock film - $1,500</li>
<li>Research - $2,500</li>
<li>Subtitling - $3,000</li>
<li>Distribution and advertising $5,200</li>
</ul>
<p>All funds will go toward the making of this film, which means it will help offset all of the major costs associated with post production and distribution. <br/></p>
<p>As a contributor, you will be a part of our growing <b><i>Force in Nature</i></b> community, and will be entitled to a gift from us, ranging from our especially designed t-shirt, a free pass to the screening, and even an associate producer credit! There is also a Monograph (see photo) that we will be giving away as part of our 'perks'. Two of the monographs, originally published for the 1992 one-man exhibit at the National Gallery of Iceland, have been especially signed and embossed by the artist, and have been especially offered as part of fund raising for this film.</p>

<p>Jóhann Eyfells, a constantly evolving artist, is presently working on
 a new series of work that embodies his vision that takes prehistoric 
elements and combines them with contemporary steel structures. Rocks, 
reminiscent of Stonehenge, shaped and sculpted by time, by the slow 
erosive power of water and wind are now a part of his vision as an 
artist. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact<br/>
</h3>
<p>
<b><i><span>""I am of the opinion that A Force in Nature is an extremely important and historic documentary and a major contribution to contemporary art history.""  </span></i></b><span>Mark Alexander - Director of Art Services 2000 Ltd.</span><br/>
</p>
<p>I first met <b>Jóhann Eyfells</b> almost 10 years ago. Being in his immediate 
presence and reflecting on his large body of work, it quickly became apparent to
 me that Eyfells is by 
far, one of the most inspiring artists I'd ever known, and quite possibly one of the most influential sculptors of the 21st century. Because of that I was compelled to make this
 documentary.
This film speaks to all artists, young and old alike, who see Jóhann 
Eyfells as a beacon of hope in bringing artistic expression to an 
entirely new level of understanding. Eyfells' art, at its core, 
conveys the very essence of nature's powerful creative force that reside
 both in the material and metaphysical world we live in. <br/>
</p>
<p>In Johann's 
words: <i><em></em></i></p>
<p><i><em></em></i>
<b><i><em>""the creative forces trump the destructive forces, because 
the latter is subordinated by it. Love is such a force that it can never
 be destroyed.""</em></i></b> <em></em></p>
<p><br/><em></em></p>
<p><em></em>

<br/>
</p>
<i><b><em></em></b></i><br/><br/><b>""Eyfells' work conveys the sense of man being threatened by the earth. It is fate in the form of time and gravity... . The earth is conspicuously titanic in Iceland, and it it this earth in upheaval that finds its way into Eyfells' sculpture.""</b>  Donald Kuspit - Art Historian and Critic<br/><br/><p>And as Jóhann Eyfells so eloquently puts it:</p>
<p><i><b><em>""Yes
 I am an old man, yet I am now on a wave of growing productivity and 
ideas. I want the world to know that I am always evolving as an artist 
and at this moment in time, I am finding a growing momentum in my work. 
You haven't seen anything yet. I am a force in motion...""</em></b></i></p>

<p><i><b><em></em></b></i></p>
</div> <div>
<h3>Challenges Ahead<br/>
</h3> <p>This film has been in the making since 2007. In June of 2012, shortly after our first successful fundraiser campaign, we flew to Iceland and spent 3 weeks filming, interviewing the very people who intimately knew him and had witnessed the challenges he faced as a controversial artist in Iceland. We have intimately followed the life and work of Jóhann Eyfells for 8 years now, and we are now ready to complete final phase  of OUR film so that we may present this phenomenal story to the world.</p>
<p>This production has faced some major hurdles, but thanks to you we overcame one of the most difficult ones, the filming. Now we are faced with one more challenge, and that is to make this story compelling and memorable through the magic of editing. <span><span>We spent an additional <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/hayden.yates/posts/10205556941575124?comment_id=10205557518909557&amp;reply_comment_id=10205558122684651&amp;offset=0&amp;total_comments=4&amp;notif_t=feed_comment#"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">$9500</a> of our own funds to support our editing team and edit 66% of the film, which is over an hour of scene work. <span>The final third of the film reaches into the past and requires research, stock, and the time to craft the life of the artist.</span></span></span><br/></p>
<p>We cannot do it alone, if we want this story to be seen. Without additional resources for the film, it will take us more time to finish. With your contributions, we will be able to complete it in a timely way, within the next 5 months.<br/>

What We Need & What You ReceiveThree years ago, through Indiegogo, we successfully raised $23,115 out of the $35,000 we initially needed for the barebones production of A Force in Nature. Thanks to the generous contributions we received from people everywhere, we were able to send a small crew (myself and a camera assistant) to Iceland and film non-stop for almost three 
weeks, capturing some of the most spectacular landscapes we've ever seen and meet with some of the most colorful characters that knew Johann intimately. Since then we have been working on and off editing
 the project, on our own time and resources.
We want to raise an additional $25,700 for the last part 
of the production which would 
help us assemble all of the necessary elements we captured in Iceland and Texas and put the finishing touches to it. Here is the breakdown of what we are looking for in terms of 
support:
This is for editing and other post-production elements for the film:


Finishing Fee Post production - $10,500 (assistant editors, color grading)

Music rights fee - composers and musicians - $3,000
Stock film - $1,500
Research - $2,500
Subtitling - $3,000
Distribution and advertising $5,200

All funds will go toward the making of this film, which means it will help offset all of the major costs associated with post production and distribution. 
As a contributor, you will be a part of our growing Force in Nature community, and will be entitled to a gift from us, ranging from our especially designed t-shirt, a free pass to the screening, and even an associate producer credit! There is also a Monograph (see photo) that we will be giving away as part of our 'perks'. Two of the monographs, originally published for the 1992 one-man exhibit at the National Gallery of Iceland, have been especially signed and embossed by the artist, and have been especially offered as part of fund raising for this film.



Our deepest gratitude goes to our initial supporters. This film would not be where it is now without them:
Ingólfur Eyfells (Associate Producer & Production Coordinator - Iceland), Claudia Pictet (Producer), Mona Miller (Associate Producer), Bernadette Gambino (Associate Producer), Glyn Vincent (Associate Producer), G. Vincent Morland (Associate Producer), Driss Ben-Brahim (Associate Producer), Margit Yates (Associate Producer), J. Eugene Marans (Associate Producer), Elizabeth Compton (Associate Producer)
and...
Sonja Luther, Natasha Morland, Don Lampasone, Sherryl & David Paul Brown, Susan Pratt, Eyjólfur Eyfells, Lee Chen & Woody Norman, Tetsuya Aomatsu, Claudine Torfs, Igor Michel, John & Cathy Bennett, Heather Ringman, David Skibsrud, Talon Skibsrud, Elizabeth Kling, Glenn Mobley, Benjamin and Kisha Conroy, Cynthia Rubinstein, Dawn K Donaldson, Dorinda Yates, Frank Souders, Brooke Aaron, Richard Finkelstein, Viviane Vives, Valentina Pero, Groa Hreinsdottir, Eugene Marsh, Pamela Farland, Christian Schmidt, Carol Lafayette, Danu Aribe, Arun Vir-Dawkins, Sarah Sullivan, Karine & Thomas Constantin, Michael Vera, Daniel Terry, David DeBlieck, Tyler Mager, Daniel Hirons, and Claudie de la Maisoneuve, 
It should be mentioned that EVERYONE who has initially contributed to the filming phase of A Force in Nature will be receiving a designed t-shirt in addition to the original perk you are slated for. Your encouragement was invaluable to the success of our first phase, the filming, so THANK YOU!

 


 
Jóhann Eyfells, a constantly evolving artist, is presently working on
 a new series of work that embodies his vision that takes prehistoric 
elements and combines them with contemporary steel structures. Rocks, 
reminiscent of Stonehenge, shaped and sculpted by time, by the slow 
erosive power of water and wind are now a part of his vision as an 
artist. 


The Impact


""I am of the opinion that A Force in Nature is an extremely important and historic documentary and a major contribution to contemporary art history.""  Mark Alexander - Director of Art Services 2000 Ltd.

I first met Jóhann Eyfells almost 10 years ago. Being in his immediate 
presence and reflecting on his large body of work, it quickly became apparent to
 me that Eyfells is by 
far, one of the most inspiring artists I'd ever known, and quite possibly one of the most influential sculptors of the 21st century. Because of that I was compelled to make this
 documentary.
This film speaks to all artists, young and old alike, who see Jóhann 
Eyfells as a beacon of hope in bringing artistic expression to an 
entirely new level of understanding. Eyfells' art, at its core, 
conveys the very essence of nature's powerful creative force that reside
 both in the material and metaphysical world we live in. 

In Johann's 
words: 

""the creative forces trump the destructive forces, because 
the latter is subordinated by it. Love is such a force that it can never
 be destroyed."" 





""Eyfells' work conveys the sense of man being threatened by the earth. It is fate in the form of time and gravity... . The earth is conspicuously titanic in Iceland, and it it this earth in upheaval that finds its way into Eyfells' sculpture.""  Donald Kuspit - Art Historian and CriticAnd as Jóhann Eyfells so eloquently puts it:
""Yes
 I am an old man, yet I am now on a wave of growing productivity and 
ideas. I want the world to know that I am always evolving as an artist 
and at this moment in time, I am finding a growing momentum in my work. 
You haven't seen anything yet. I am a force in motion...""


 
Challenges Ahead
 This film has been in the making since 2007. In June of 2012, shortly after our first successful fundraiser campaign, we flew to Iceland and spent 3 weeks filming, interviewing the very people who intimately knew him and had witnessed the challenges he faced as a controversial artist in Iceland. We have intimately followed the life and work of Jóhann Eyfells for 8 years now, and we are now ready to complete final phase  of OUR film so that we may present this phenomenal story to the world.
This production has faced some major hurdles, but thanks to you we overcame one of the most difficult ones, the filming. Now we are faced with one more challenge, and that is to make this story compelling and memorable through the magic of editing. We spent an additional $9500 of our own funds to support our editing team and edit 66% of the film, which is over an hour of scene work. The final third of the film reaches into the past and requires research, stock, and the time to craft the life of the artist.
We cannot do it alone, if we want this story to be seen. Without additional resources for the film, it will take us more time to finish. With your contributions, we will be able to complete it in a timely way, within the next 5 months.

<p></p>
<p>As everyone knows, making a film requires a lot of resources and wrangling to get to the finish line--to see the completed film on screen in front of an audience. </p>
<p>For TATTOO YOU, we are asking ALL of our contacts and colleagues for favors on this project. But it's no surprise that making a film costs money. So even with all the favors, we need funds for equipment, locations, production design, sound design, hiring a crew (and feeding them), making sure we get a top-notch cast (and feeding them), and all the post-production costs. Your tax-deductible donation will go directly to these items!</p>
<p>We are hoping that the film will get into a variety of film festivals so we can have this important conversation with audiences and communities across the country. Of course, there is always a risk that we will not get into festivals. If that is the case, we will release the film online. Our goal is to reach a broad audience and we will do whatever it takes to do that. Your donation will go toward getting TATTOO YOU out into the world.</p>
<p>Our goal is to create a compelling film that reaches audiences emotionally. In order to do that, we need your support to tell the best story possible. </p>
<p>Thanks so much and hope to see you in a movie theatre in the near future!</p>

<p><b><i>From The Writer: </i></b></p>
<p><i>People often ask, is this story true? The answer is no--the story and characters are entirely fictional. I did go to my high school reunion several years ago, and I had a great time reconnecting with old friends. But as a writer, I'm a keen observer with an active imagination. So I also saw that some people hadn't changed all that much. I noticed that some people, years later, still reverted to those classic archetypes: the popular girl, the shy kid, the partier and the bully.</i></p>
<p><i>When I sat down to write, this is what came out--the past meeting the present for these two women, in a haunted place. <b>It wasn't until the play was out in the world, in front of audiences, that I fully realized its impact and the universality of the situation I had created.</b> People from all walks of life could relate to Tammy and Rachel. After seeing the play, they would approach me and share their stories. </i></p>
<p><i>As I listened to their stories, I wondered how their experiences shaped who they are today. I realized this was a conversation worth having. <b>The adult perspective  doesn't come up when people talk about bullying. And that's why we are making this film.</b> Because there are countless stories of how people overcome bullying to lead hugely successful lives. (Check out our <a href=""http://www.tattooyouthefilm.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">website </a>and on <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/tattooyouthefilm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=' target=""_blank""'>Facebook</a>.) Because those who experienced bullying--I do not think of them as victims--are more than just survivors. They are heroes. And they have much to share and to teach us. </i></p>
<p><i>The story of <b>Tattoo You </b>leaves much to the imagination because most, if not all of us, have experienced some form of bullying. We can fill in our own blanks. Maybe you were the bully; maybe you were the bullied. Maybe it happened to you as a kid in the locker room; maybe it's happening right now in your job.

WHY SHOULD YOU CARE ABOUT TATTOO YOU?
Because bullying impacts everyone. 
This film project will help ignite a new conversation that looks at bullying from an adult perspective. Scars are like tattoos - they don't fade away. Tattoo You will also invite people from around the world to share their stories and experiences. 
Based on the award winning play (2013 National 10-Minute Play Award from The Kennedy Center American College Theater Festival), Lisa Kenner Grissom's  Tattoo You tells the story of two women from the same town, yet with very different backgrounds, who re-connect in the bathroom at their 20th high school reunion where their troubled past breaks the cool veneer of the present. 
Tattoo You is a narrative drama that has social relevance beyond the movie screen by offering the following: 
A different perspective on the issue of bullying.
A jumping off point for a broader discussion about the issue.
An opportunity to use the film as an educational tool to discuss how bullying affects people into adulthood, highlighting real stories of inspiration and empowerment.


WHY ARE WE ASKING YOU FOR MONEY? WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO WITH IT?

<p>The Warzone Boxing
Club has been in existence since 2002. In this time we have developed 18
National and International Champions as well as two World Boxing Council (WBC)
Intercontinental Champions in the professional ranks. Our Champions run all our
programs for youths, adults and veterans. </p>
<p>In 2009 we began an
all Military Veteran Boxing program that is 100% FREE and has brought in
several veterans who showed interest in not just gym use but actual
competition. We also work with local VET Centers and several of their employees
donate time here. Today we have almost 100 veterans signed-up and are looking
to double that in 2016. We have formed an all veteran boxing team known as the
WarDogz and they are currently training to compete in USA Sanctioned Boxing
events. </p>

Our goal is to raise enough
money so that we can begin a new program for veterans with mental and physical
disabilities while serving and advancing the current men and women we have with
us now. Equipment will be purchased and the hiring of veterans with experience
in PTSD will be brought in to work along with our trainers. With your help this
can all be obtained<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>
<p>We are in need of

<p>Our ultimate goal by
2020 is to move into a large facility so that we can further expand programs to
spouses and children of active duty soldiers for Free seven days per week.</p>
<p>Any amount of donation
is greatly appreciated and with enough help we will succeed in our goals. </p> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>
<p>We all know that many
of our servicemen come back with disabilities physically and mentally. A lot of
these men and women need more than just a counselor; they need a sense of
belonging and a way to let out their anger and frustration. We give them that,
we make them comfortable and allow them to become a part of our family. We also
give them tasks to meet physically and mentally. We challenge their minds and
bodies and this gives them a satisfaction that can be seen in their faces. </p>
<p>For the past 6 years
we have been offering our services for Free to these fine individuals and we
always will. But we need your help. Please take the time to speak to a veteran
or watch a video of our Wardogz Team.  </p>
<p>Since 2009 a majority
of our veterans here have become a part of our family, we attend events together;
they show tremendous support and are always willing to give a helping hand.
They are grateful when in fact it is our staff that is honored to have these heroes
who have chosen to serve our Country and allow us to sit back and enjoy the
freedom they defend and have defended. We are the ones who are and should be

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">The idea for this App was borne last year, when I noticed large gaping holes in our services, commitment and support for people in domestic and family violence situations. Violence doesn't discriminate. Every person on this planet has the RIGHT to live without harm or prejudice.</span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">After yet another tragedy from domestic and family violence made the news only days ago here in Australia, taking the lives of a mother, her unborn baby and a beautiful and innocent 7 year old, we need to BREAK THE SILENCE. This is UNACCEPTABLE and we cannot wait any longer. The time to act is NOW. </span></p>
<p><span>Although I cannot divulge the complex &amp; complete details of this App (due to Intellectual Property) I wholeheartedly believe this App will evoke the innate courage to surface from within victims, yet at the same time it will assist dramatically in deterring perpetrators. It is a one-of-a-kind App and there is nothing else like it on the market. </span></p>
<p><span>In my research I have found that most domestic violence education occurs prior to the violent event, is aimed at prevention via information sources and centres on providing resources to the worldwide Community.

</div></div>","Help Break The Silence
The idea for this App was borne last year, when I noticed large gaping holes in our services, commitment and support for people in domestic and family violence situations. Violence doesn't discriminate. Every person on this planet has the RIGHT to live without harm or prejudice.
After yet another tragedy from domestic and family violence made the news only days ago here in Australia, taking the lives of a mother, her unborn baby and a beautiful and innocent 7 year old, we need to BREAK THE SILENCE. This is UNACCEPTABLE and we cannot wait any longer. The time to act is NOW. 
Although I cannot divulge the complex & complete details of this App (due to Intellectual Property) I wholeheartedly believe this App will evoke the innate courage to surface from within victims, yet at the same time it will assist dramatically in deterring perpetrators. It is a one-of-a-kind App and there is nothing else like it on the market. 
In my research I have found that most domestic violence education occurs prior to the violent event, is aimed at prevention via information sources and centres on providing resources to the worldwide Community. The intervention after the trauma is focused on victim safety, breaking the cycle, dealing with PTSD, and starting over. These services are utterly essential in rebuilding lives.
However, there is NOTHING available for the victims of domestic and family violence DURING the terrifying trauma itself. THIS APP ADDRESSES THIS! 
It is worthy of noting too, that this innovative App is in no way limited to domestic violence incidences.  I also see it being utilised in areas such as suicide prevention, and hostage and seige situations, to name but a few. Victims will be able to contact Emergency Service personnel when there is no option to call, or be heard (hiding in a cupboard, or locked in a bathroom, for example). Children can be shown how to use it too. It is SILENT. The secret is to remain one step ahead of the perpetrators. This App arms the authorities with the element of surprise, as it is when the victim is heard, and trying to phone for help, that rage in the abuser escalates, and the victim is most vulnerable.  This App eliminates this scenerio. 
The App will be:


Free - This App will cost nothing to download.

Quick - Easy to use, and fast acting. Individual details are entered on download, and stored in the App.

Simple - In moments of terror, this App needs to be simple and straight-       forward.


Efficient - This App will need constant monitoring and updating.  It cannot afford to fail.

Silent - an absolute MUST.


Secure - Lock screen enabled. The App icon will be changed every six weeks.

Responsive - The information and circumstances are in the hands of those that can help INSTANTLY

Fast Acting - App must be quick to load.

Safe - The App will have a Quick Exit button to take you out of the App immediately. The Lock Screen keeps all details and information safe.

Child Friendly - Children can be shown the passcode, and how to use the App.

Easily disguised - App icon will not be easily identifiable as a Domestic Violence App.

Quick Exit strategy - a one touch Exit button from the App

 
The Impact

This App will revolutionise the way we provide help and intervention for victims of domestic violence. It will assist in decreasing the number of domestic and family violence cases, allowing potential victims to live without fear. We also aim to have it deter potential perpetrators from abusing.
The biggest Impact: Lives will be saved. There is no impact more important than that.

The leadership on this project has invaluable experience on independent as well as major sets including: 2013 Indie film Melody and The Old Sock, TV shows such as The Voice, America's Got Talent, ABC's Empire, and major motion picture Transformers.With experience, passion and a knowledge of the industry we're excited and well prepared for the journey ahead.

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>The Tutor tells the story of ballet dancer and former teaching assistant Alex, a twenty nine year old Londoner disillusioned by rejection of dance roles which she feels capable of doing justice to.  <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">As she dances her way from one audition to the next and daydreams in the park she finds herself and her dancing subject to a voyeur in the form of a five year old boy named Junior. </span></p>
<p></p>

<br/>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">When Alex tries to return Junior to his parents she is met by dismissive and angry behaviour. </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">On returning him home. Alex is approached by Juniors father Dan, a working class single parent. Dan remembers Alex from her teaching assistant days and </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">asks her to be a home tutor for Junior for a week. </span><br/></p>

<br/>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Alex initially declines but after a visit to a former student is reminded why she began teaching in the first place. </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Alex takes the home tutoring position. </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">During the sessions Juniors aggressive outbursts and reluctance to listen present Alex with extreme challenges. </span></p>

<br/>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Dan's lack of presence in the household and his absence as a parent is confronted by Alex who threatens to leave the position unless something is done. </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Dan challenges Alex and calls her a </span>quitter,<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> stating she gave up ballet and now going to give up on his son. Shortly after the argument Dan apologises, giving his assurance that he will talk to his son. </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">As the sessions continue Alex and Junior begin to work together. The tutoring sessions not only have a positive affect on Junior but also vice versa. Dan also learns and confronts his past realising the mistakes that he made in his life. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 0px;line-height: 30px;"">I see a film trailer. Has this film been made?</span><br/></p>
<div>NO NOT YET! After months of saving up and planning we filmed a couple of scenes from the script and put together this trailer. The plan is <i>(pending we raise enough funds) </i>to shoot the feature film this summer. <b>We filmed the scenes and made the trailer to give audiences a vision of our film. </b>

<h3>Why should you support us?</h3>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">i'd be lying if i didn't say i felt a little ""squeamish"" in asking for your money to help us make a movie.  I prefer to think that this is an investment in the message of the film. I intend to donate half of the Producers profits <i>(after expenses) </i>from the release film to an educational charity. </span></p>

<p>When filming my debut feature film <b><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs6L4nvd7hE"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sweetboy</a></b> I tried to do everything (directing, acting and self funded it outright) and as a result endured some failures. Some stories are so crazy you really won't believe them (read my <b><a href=""http://sweetboymovie.blogspot.co.uk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">directors diary</a></b>). It's fair to say that these failures through learnt lessons and a lot of hard work were a stepping stone to a successful ending (<i>selected for the American black film festival 2014</i>). <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><b><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugqCMFjUufk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Hooligan </a></b>my first ever short was made for three hundred pound <i>(selected for the Short Corner at The Cannes Film Festival)</i>. </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><i>Sweetboy</i> my debut feature film was made for around ten thousand pound.

<p>Our budget will be used towards not only equipment but also locations, talent, crew and marketing. This will go along way to restraining our struggle.  We are extremely excited to be filming with the ARRI AMIRA. This camera has fulfilled our vision. The script is catered to our budget. Minimal locations and a minimal cast and just the <b>Most Amazing Team </b>(<i>my fav word</i>). </p>

<h2><b>OKAY BUT WHY ELSE SHOULD I BACK THIS PROJECT?</b></h2>
<p></p>
<p>I've been working in education for quite a while, its only right a percentage of the profits made from the release of the film is donated to help young lives. </p>
<h3><b>YOU WILL BE SUPPORTING UP AND COMING DIVERSE TALENT! </b></h3>
<div><b><br/></b></div>
<h3><b>How will this film be distributed?</b></h3>
<div>We plan to screen the film on the International festival circuit to create a momentum and buzz around the film and also share it with the world. Before selecting the right distributors to help assist in our VOD, home video and theatrical release. </div>

Really does mean the world to me.  I'm just a guy following his dreams and helping others to follow theirs. I've worked in education as well as the film industry for over 4 years now and it's fair to say that this film is one that's extremely close to my heart. Once the film is made and released 50% of producers profits will be donated to Educational charity.Working 3 jobs round the clock night and day to fund my first feature film had to be done and I will be carrying the same ethos into this project. But I realise it cannot be done alone.  We're offering amazing awards. From dinner with the cast and crew, to speaking parts.

Synopsis
The Tutor tells the story of ballet dancer and former teaching assistant Alex, a twenty nine year old Londoner disillusioned by rejection of dance roles which she feels capable of doing justice to.  As she dances her way from one audition to the next and daydreams in the park she finds herself and her dancing subject to a voyeur in the form of a five year old boy named Junior. 




When Alex tries to return Junior to his parents she is met by dismissive and angry behaviour. On returning him home. Alex is approached by Juniors father Dan, a working class single parent. Dan remembers Alex from her teaching assistant days and asks her to be a home tutor for Junior for a week. 




Alex initially declines but after a visit to a former student is reminded why she began teaching in the first place. Alex takes the home tutoring position. During the sessions Juniors aggressive outbursts and reluctance to listen present Alex with extreme challenges. 



Dan's lack of presence in the household and his absence as a parent is confronted by Alex who threatens to leave the position unless something is done. Dan challenges Alex and calls her a quitter, stating she gave up ballet and now going to give up on his son. Shortly after the argument Dan apologises, giving his assurance that he will talk to his son. As the sessions continue Alex and Junior begin to work together. The tutoring sessions not only have a positive affect on Junior but also vice versa. Dan also learns and confronts his past realising the mistakes that he made in his life. 
I see a film trailer. Has this film been made?
NO NOT YET! After months of saving up and planning we filmed a couple of scenes from the script and put together this trailer. The plan is (pending we raise enough funds) to shoot the feature film this summer. We filmed the scenes and made the trailer to give audiences a vision of our film. 









Why should you support us?
i'd be lying if i didn't say i felt a little ""squeamish"" in asking for your money to help us make a movie.  I prefer to think that this is an investment in the message of the film. I intend to donate half of the Producers profits (after expenses) from the release film to an educational charity. 




When filming my debut feature film Sweetboy I tried to do everything (directing, acting and self funded it outright) and as a result endured some failures. Some stories are so crazy you really won't believe them (read my directors diary). It's fair to say that these failures through learnt lessons and a lot of hard work were a stepping stone to a successful ending (selected for the American black film festival 2014). Hooligan my first ever short was made for three hundred pound (selected for the Short Corner at The Cannes Film Festival). Sweetboy my debut feature film was made for around ten thousand pound. These are zero budget. 


Our budget will be used towards not only equipment but also locations, talent, crew and marketing. This will go along way to restraining our struggle.  We are extremely excited to be filming with the ARRI AMIRA. This camera has fulfilled our vision. The script is catered to our budget. Minimal locations and a minimal cast and just the Most Amazing Team (my fav word). 

We're offering amazing awards. From dinner with the cast and crew, to speaking parts.
OKAY BUT WHY ELSE SHOULD I BACK THIS PROJECT?

I've been working in education for quite a while, its only right a percentage of the profits made from the release of the film is donated to help young lives. 
YOU WILL BE SUPPORTING UP AND COMING DIVERSE TALENT! 

How will this film be distributed?
We plan to screen the film on the International festival circuit to create a momentum and buzz around the film and also share it with the world. Before selecting the right distributors to help assist in our VOD, home video and theatrical release.

He came to me with this idea for a webcast featuring entrepreneur's throughout the state of New Jersey. I immediately offered to produce it for him. Many people are dissatisfied with their quality of life after graduating from school. They are saddled with a low-paying job and student loans. They give up on their dreams. Young and Thriving will teach viewers what is possible.
We are looking to raise $1,700 to purchase the IKAN IFB-576 light kit. Our stretch goal (if we exceed $1,700 and the indiegogo fee) is to purchase a lavalier microphone or two. These microphones will record better sound than the camera microphone.
Donors who contribute enough will be given a Young and Thriving t-shirt and/or poster. We will record an episode with those who contribute $150 wherein they explain why they chose to donate. 
Alexander Matos is a young entrepreneur with a growing business in Multilevel Marketing whose dream is to coach 100 million people to Financial Success and Fortitude. Yet it is his passion for creating opportunity for others that makes Young and Thriving possible. In his words:""You see, I learned in leadership a long time ago that people are generally an average of what they see the most. And for most of us, what we consistently observe has a lot to with chance. Factors like where we were born, who are friends are, what we believe and what we do is largely based on luck. If we never learn that we can change or grow then we become stuck in this unintentional prison, but thanks to the invention of books and now the internet we have the power to truly and freely choose what we see and how we grow or become the average of.

<h2>Where Belushi's Toilet Started</h2><div>
<p>Hi, I’m Andrew Wright, the Director and Writer of Belushi’s Toilet.</p>
<p>The story behind this project begins back in the UK in the early 90s. I ran an independent record label, producing techno and drum and bass, and the rave scene was my life.</p>
<p>When I eventually got a real job, I still looked back on this time with great nostalgia and started thinking about the next venture I could take that could recapture that era. </p>
<p></p>
<h3>What Belushi's Toilet is About</h3>
<p></p>
<p>I spent 13 years, on and off, writing a script, based on mine and other friends' experiences, but set in the future. I wanted to explore the question of what would society be like if drugs were legal? Would civilization collapse, or would we just adapt to a new normal? I also wanted characters going to 90s and 2000s nostalgia music events, like we currently go to 70s and 80s nights. So the concept is kind of of future-retro.<br/></p>
<p>Since I moved to Toronto, I’ve been able to tap into the great indie filmmaking scene here and assembled an amazing cast and crew. Now Belushi’s Toilet is a web-series. We've launched episodes 1 and 2, and are in production of episodes 3 and 4. </p>

and age where 3D CGI-animated features have become the norm, there is something
to be said for the art of hand-drawn art. Independent animation usually relies
on cut-outs or computer-generated in-betweening, making its visuals cheap and robotic.
As die-hard fans of the Golden Age of animation, we are taking the approach of
Warner Bros. and MGM cartoons of the 40s and 50s: irreverent characters in full,
fluid animation. Inspired by the wild works of Tex Avery, Chuck Jones and Bob Clampett,
our approach to Desert Mirage is to make something in the same spirit without
any of the early Hollywood restrictions the old masters were forced to deal
with.<span>  </span></span></p>

dreams by reconnecting with his rich brother Jack. But when Cliff finds himself at the mercy of
the animated characters he created as a child, they band together and form a
devilish plan to exact revenge on all those that have wronged him. 
Why make a 2D animated film?

In a day
and age where 3D CGI-animated features have become the norm, there is something
to be said for the art of hand-drawn art. Independent animation usually relies
on cut-outs or computer-generated in-betweening, making its visuals cheap and robotic.
As die-hard fans of the Golden Age of animation, we are taking the approach of
Warner Bros. and MGM cartoons of the 40s and 50s: irreverent characters in full,
fluid animation. Inspired by the wild works of Tex Avery, Chuck Jones and Bob Clampett,
our approach to Desert Mirage is to make something in the same spirit without
any of the early Hollywood restrictions the old masters were forced to deal
with.  


What is Wild Dogs Productions?
Wild Dogs Productions is an independent film company run
by writer/producer/director Michael Fredianelli. Having experimented in a
wide range of genres, their goal remains the same: to deliver daring,
controversial films outside the mainstream. With over a dozen titles in
their catalog including The Minstrel Killer, Apocrypha and The Scarlet Worm,
their films have played numerous festivals, garnered excellent reviews,
collected audience awards and have received domestic and international video
distribution. 
What will we do with the money? 
There is well over an hour’s worth of animation in Desert
Mirage’s 90+ minute running time. With approximately 70% of the rough animation
already completed, the funds will go towards additional animation,
in-betweening, clean-up, and digital ink and painting. Traditional, fluid
animation is a very time-consuming and expensive process and our current goal
is the bare minimum to complete our feature film this year.
The Team



Michael Fredianelli (Writer/Director)
From a very young age, Michael has always had a passion for visual storytelling. Without any formal training or schooling, he formed his own production company, Wild Dogs Productions in 2004 and has since written, produced and directed 17 feature films and over 25 shorts in a variety of genres. Over the years, his work has reached a large number of local film festivals in addition to an international audience.


Chad Kaplan (Animation Director)
Born and raised in New England, Chad Kaplan is a 2D
artist and animator who has worked on a variety of short films in addition to
several features. While initially self-taught, Kaplan chose art and animation
as something to seriously pursue as a young adult. He graduated cum laude from
Emerson College in 2012 where he majored in animation and motion media. In addition,
he received further education at Rhode Island School of Design where he
developed more skills in the medium.


 Jeremy Koerner (Actor/Voice Actor)

The multi-talented Jeremy Koerner has always had a
passion in performing, creating his own Mysteries for Hire company and starring
in dozens of shorts and feature-length films. With a natural screen presence
and a specialty in improvisation and physical comedy, he is the perfect choice
to play the lead in Desert Mirage in addition to voicing many of the cartoon
characters.
The Animators and Supporting Actors
We have a very capable team of animators, clean-up
artists, inkers and background painters including Francis Tan, Brian Royer,
Josh Cianciulli, Bill Tiller, Arika Dion, James Tully, Steven Guardado, Lace Lancaster,
Moises Mercado, Chris Lines, Jon Caron and many others.
Rounding out the live-action cast includes the talents
of John S. Boles, George S. Gemette, Sheilah Morrison, Melinda Torgersen,
Tabbitha McBride, Morgan Finley King, Brandon Peterson and Tyler Torgersen.",7.0,0,"3 Campaigns

Story:</b></p>
<p>“Hey, aren’t
you that girl whose mother has green hair and comes to school with her?”</p>
<p>Imagine hearing
that over and over at the age of sixteen. Imagine knowing that it was true.
Imagine the daily humiliation being the least of your troubles.</p>
<p>I don’t have to
imagine it. I lived it.</p>
<p>I was a junior
in high school at the onset of my mother’s psychosis. I watched in helpless
horror as she transformed from a cheerful, caring woman into a vicious, violent
monster. For many months I waited – waited for someone to help me, to help her,
to help us.</p>
<p>The help never
came.</p>
<p>I was seventeen
when I finally fled cross-country. I spent months living alone on the streets
of Berkeley, gathering bottles and cans I could trade in for food. It was still
easier to bear than the unpredictable terror of life with my mother.</p>
<p>In May of 2013,
I found her obituary online. She had died, six years before, in 2007.</p>
<p>This is how my
memoir was born. I wrote <i>On Hearing of My
Mother’s Death Six Years After It Happened: A Daughter’s Memoir of Mental Illness</i>
in order to commemorate my experience of my mother’s illness.</p>
<p>I had never
wanted to tell our story before. Part of me was afraid that she would find it
and then find me. Yes, more than two decades later, I was still scared. But once she
was gone, I felt it was time. Someone has to tell these kinds of stories.</p>
<p>It wasn’t my mother’s
fault, what happened to her. She was sick, and I knew it. But knowing that makes
it no better. In some ways, it’s worse. A physically sick person gets help. A
mentally ill one may not.</p>
<p>There’s a lot of
concern today about the stigma surrounding mental illness. Although attitudes
are gradually changing, very few people want to admit that they’re hurt or in pain.
They’re afraid of being accused of being lazy or pathetic or simply insane. After
my experience, I can’t say that I blame them. I wouldn’t want to tell, either. It’s
bad enough having to confess that you have a close relative with such a
condition. I can’t imagine being the person suffering from the disease.</p>
<p>And this, at its heart, is the
driving force behind stories like mine. No one is talking, and even fewer are listening.
No one wants to confess that they have a problem, and no one knows how to react
if they do. It’s suffering in damning, damaging silence. Because stories like
mine and my mother’s are not going to end until we begin telling them.</p>
<p><b>The
Campaign:</b></p>
<p>My goal in this
campaign is to put my story in front of the next generation.</p>
<p>I want to bring
my book into classrooms, at the high school and college levels, to present my
story as a raw and painful example of how devastating an untreated mental
illness can be. I want college psychology students to read it, to get an
understanding not just of my mother’s illness, but of the effect that it had on
the development of the child in her care. I want to discuss it in high schools,
where even now there may be students in similar situations – or those who,
perhaps, are suffering themselves, and might benefit from learning what can
happen if a person doesn’t seek help.</p>
<p>No one can go
back and fix what happened to me or my mother. But it doesn’t have to happen
the way that it did, over and over, to parent after parent, and kid after kid.
There’s still time for the youth of today. I want to see them talking about
things that my generation kept quiet, and my mother’s generation hushed up all
together. They don’t have to repeat our mistakes – they only need us to give
them the tools with which to understand how and why we went wrong.</p>
<p>The time is ripe; people are ready
to listen. All we have to do is tell them – what we need to tell, and what they
need to hear.</p>
<p><b>The
Plan:</b></p>
<p>The first step
is to mail copies of my book to teachers and professors in my local area (San
Francisco – East Bay) and inquire whether they might be interested in using it
in their curricula. I believe that sending out physical copies attracts more
attention than an email or letter, and it gives the recipient a chance to
examine my story as well as my writing. I will include a request that the book
be donated to the institution’s library if the recipient elects not to use it,
which will have a similar, if smaller, effect in sharing my story.</p>
<p>If I obtain a
sufficient number of positive responses, I would like to expand this program to
other areas of California, and eventually, across the whole country. However, I
prefer to begin in the Bay Area because it will give me the opportunity to make
personal appearances – to meet with students and answer their questions, which
I think would be a very valuable additional benefit.</p>
<p>The funding I am seeking, less Indiegogo’s
fees and the estimated costs of perks, will cover the expense of printing and
shipping about eighty books.</p>
<p><b>The
Perks:</b></p>
<p>I can make the following perks

<p>MidKnight Pictures is not that kind of Production Company. Not
that we don’t plan on making money, but we understand the principle that a film’s
success will be determined not by the stars, budget or effects, but by the
connection it creates with the audience. With that in mind, we’re making a
concerted effort to bring you into the film as much as possible, and we don’t
just mean making an awesome movie that you’re going to love. We mean putting
you right on set with us as we actually make the movie! There will be live
production blogs, interactive web chats from the cast and more behind the
scenes cameras than you’ll find on the next (insert generic superhero movie
title) set. We’re giving you an all access look into how a professional feature
film gets made, and trust us when we say, you’re going to be glued to your
screen every step of the way.</p>
<p>We love movies, we have fun making them and we want to share
that experience with you. In addition to all of our tremendous perks, a

connection it creates with the audience. With that in mind, we’re making a
concerted effort to bring you into the film as much as possible, and we don’t
just mean making an awesome movie that you’re going to love. We mean putting
you right on set with us as we actually make the movie! There will be live
production blogs, interactive web chats from the cast and more behind the
scenes cameras than you’ll find on the next (insert generic superhero movie
title) set. We’re giving you an all access look into how a professional feature
film gets made, and trust us when we say, you’re going to be glued to your
screen every step of the way.
We love movies, we have fun making them and we want to share
that experience with you. In addition to all of our tremendous perks, a
donation to our campaign establishes you as part of the MidKnight Pictures social
media community so you can comment, like and share your thoughts and
experiences as we create this film. So please, get involved, reach out to the
cast and crew on social media and stay tuned for all the exciting updates we
have in store for you!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

IS THIS FILM ABOUT?</span></p>
<p>
'Blue
Shift' is a short film based on the story found in a science fiction
novella named 'Blue Shift: A Starfall Chronicle' released earlier
this year. The story focuses on Commander Shen, a formidable elite
alien law officer, who is also something of a short-sighted hot-head.
When tasked with the mission of recapturing a deep space prison ship
that has been hijacked by it's own prisoners, Shen’s impulsive
cowboy-like actions give multiple alien convicts the chance they need
to escape to a little blue planet called Earth. Now these very
dangerous extraterrestrial fugitives are running around on our world,
doing God knows what to whoever they please, and no one can stop
them, other than Shen, his attractive android partner Seesix and a
mysterious man in black known only as Mr. McGrath.

</p><h1>WHAT IS NEEDED...</h1>
<p>
While
all of the principle artwork is done and most of the characters have
been voiced, there are still a lot of animation and visual effects
work to be done, and there are still a couple of important character
voices who have not been cast yet. Also, over the past two years, one
person has basically been doing over 90% of all the animation and VFX
work on this production... and he really could use a professional
hand or two. 
</p>
<p>
Plus,
the technical side of this production has gotten very far, mostly
with inexpensive and out-of-date software, as well as a pair of
computers that aren't completely ideal for rendering a lot of CGI
footage. To finish this show, investing in at least a few higher-end
tools is a definite must.</p>

It’s a horrible experience.  I’ve been there.  Those were the dark days of living with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.<p></p><p>I’ve come a long way since then.  In fact, to most people I look and act “normal.”  But that is because they only see part of my life.  It’s not because I hide my symptoms, but because I have learned to manage many of them.  In the Fall of 2013 I was officially diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.  (You can read more of my story <a href=""http://stephaniehester.com/my-ptsd-journey/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.) Yes, civilians suffer from PTSD.</p><p></p><p>I have given several radio interviews and written many blog posts on my journey with PTSD and the tools I use to manage my illness (therapy, EMDR, supplements, art, etc).  My hope has always been that as I share my journey others will be encouraged and perhaps educated.</p><p></p><p>But I’m at a point now where I need help.  And the most amazing help has been offered to me in the form of a Service Dog trained by <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/3k9workingdogs"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">3K9 Working Dogs</a>.</p><p></p><p>So much more than a family pet, although they are amazing, this service dog will give me life.  He will be trained specifically to deal with the issues that impact me on a daily basis, the issues that hold me back and keep me from living the life I am created to live.</p><p></p><p>As someone who made her living as a Corporate Team Builder and Speaker, it’s devastating to live a life changed by PTSD.  My life after PTSD looks very different.  </p><p></p><p>•	I now struggle with crowds (I can’t go to the grocery store or farmer’s market on weekends.  I can’t go to a movie theater on Friday or Saturday night.  I avoid restaurants except during off hours.  Standing in line is a challenge, etc.)  </p><p></p><p>•	I struggle with hypervigilance, constantly looking around me to see who is approaching. (This too impacts my ability to be in public even interfering with my ability to walk outside.)  This also means I am super sensitive to noise and sudden movements.  Here is a snippet from a post I wrote titled <a href=""http://stephaniehester.com/unexpected-still-happens/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Unexpected Still Happens</a>:</p><p></p><p align=""center""><i>I explained it the best I could. “Because I am in hypervigilance mode I am hearing everything. Every laugh, every kick of the table, every book drop, every chair scooting on the floor, everything. And all this noise is constant. It’s like what you see in the movies when someone is being interrogated with sleep deprivation. They’re in a room with no sleep, extremely bright lights, and sirens blaring all the time. That’s what I feel like.

It’s a horrible experience.  I’ve been there.  Those were the dark days of living with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.I’ve come a long way since then.  In fact, to most people I look and act “normal.”  But that is because they only see part of my life.  It’s not because I hide my symptoms, but because I have learned to manage many of them.  In the Fall of 2013 I was officially diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.  (You can read more of my story here.) Yes, civilians suffer from PTSD.I have given several radio interviews and written many blog posts on my journey with PTSD and the tools I use to manage my illness (therapy, EMDR, supplements, art, etc).  My hope has always been that as I share my journey others will be encouraged and perhaps educated.But I’m at a point now where I need help.  And the most amazing help has been offered to me in the form of a Service Dog trained by 3K9 Working Dogs.So much more than a family pet, although they are amazing, this service dog will give me life.  He will be trained specifically to deal with the issues that impact me on a daily basis, the issues that hold me back and keep me from living the life I am created to live.As someone who made her living as a Corporate Team Builder and Speaker, it’s devastating to live a life changed by PTSD.  My life after PTSD looks very different.  •	I now struggle with crowds (I can’t go to the grocery store or farmer’s market on weekends.  I can’t go to a movie theater on Friday or Saturday night.  I avoid restaurants except during off hours.  Standing in line is a challenge, etc.)  •	I struggle with hypervigilance, constantly looking around me to see who is approaching. (This too impacts my ability to be in public even interfering with my ability to walk outside.)  This also means I am super sensitive to noise and sudden movements.  Here is a snippet from a post I wrote titled The Unexpected Still Happens:I explained it the best I could. “Because I am in hypervigilance mode I am hearing everything. Every laugh, every kick of the table, every book drop, every chair scooting on the floor, everything. And all this noise is constant. It’s like what you see in the movies when someone is being interrogated with sleep deprivation. They’re in a room with no sleep, extremely bright lights, and sirens blaring all the time. That’s what I feel like. It’s so bad my ears are going numb.” I don’t know if they understood, it’s hard for anyone to understand, but that was the best explanation I could give.•	I have nightmares, many I don’t remember, and some I do, often waking up in a cold sweat and panic attack.•	As you can imagine, all of these things (and more) cause a tremendous increase in anxiety.Life with PTSD is definitely different.The Gift of LifeHaving a service dog will be an incredible gift.  My service dog will be trained specifically for me and the situations in which I want to live.  He will:•	Provide pressure therapy – when my anxiety starts to build, he will either place his head in my lap or his paw on me to get my attention and “ground” me, calming me down and enabling me to get to a safe state of mind.•	Interrupt panic attacks – with a special bark he will approach me and grab my attention, again grounding me and helping pull me from a panic attack.•	Interrupt nightmares – in much the same way, he will alert to my body temperature and physical responses when I sleep, interrupting nightmares before they start.•	Provide crowd control – he will be trained to maintain a specific distance from my person not allowing anyone to accidentally bump, knock, or push me. •	Be a rear facing guard – one of the issues I have in public places is people walking up behind me.

<h3>Short Summary</h3> <p>The Devil's Toy Box is a sequel to the found footage horror movie, ""7 Nights of Darkness"".

My dance and acting training both derive from the Russian school of acting inspired by Harold Clurman. 
My dance training from the time I was a child has been with teachers who danced under ballet masters from Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo.
My acting training is with Jim Jarrett, the last protégé of Sanford Meisner, one of the founders of the Group Theatre.

My focus is on combining choreography, acting and filmmaking.

What's you're proudest moment? 


""I once pulled a moony on the local news. They pixelated it out but you could still see I had excellent definition.""
Your hottest date?
""Every single date I've had has been steamy as hell. Both of them.""
Any advice for young freerunners?
""Just basically, you know, like, be yourself and stuff. Be a yes man. Take those spanish lessons you've always wanted, try a new cuisine... learn to bake. Chicks love baked goods man.""

What's your biggest inspiration?
""Spirituality is the governing force in my life. If you say it fast enough it sounds almost exactly like 'spirit-duality.' Powerful, isn't it? Nobody ever told me that. I just knew it, instinctively.""
And instinctively contains the word 'stink.'
""You don't understand me... I think your chakras need to be cleansed. Here's a free-running haiku I wrote: 
My legs, my brushes,
The skyline my canvas,

Dan Meade


Dan is an emerging documentary filmmaker, known for his previous urban works: ""High Art in Hoxton"" and ""Ghetto Grannies"" both of which are currently doing the festival circuit. Dan has a deep interest in urban sports having hailed from South London and growing up around it. Over the past 10 years he's watched the spreading of parkour out of the big cities with interest. When he heard of the death of Harri Rodgers (a prize winning traceur from York) he was interested in finding out more. He has a 2.1 in Architecture from Oxford and trained as a filmmaker at the London Academy of Metropolitan Filmmaking.


  What We Need
We're lucky to have an exciting creative team willing to give there time to this project; however, there are some costs we can't avoid. 90% of our story takes place in York where the boys are from. We also have a section in London. We aim to raise £3,500 which will cover the following:


Camera, lighting and sound equipment

Travel expenses
 Location costs
Feeding the crew    

Impact

The finished film will be 25 minutes in length. It will stand alone as a finished short and also allow us flexibility for taking things further. Future avenues we hope to explore include using the finished film as a pilot for a full web/television series and entering it into major festivals.

Risks & ChallengesWith any film project, there are obvious risks and possible setbacks. However, we feel confident that we can deliver a quality finished product, for the following reasons:
all the key cast and crew and creative team have been assembled in advance, have pledged their time to the project, and are extremely excited to start work on it and share it with you as soon as possible
we have already shot a fair amount of test footage, as the B rolls will reveal; in the unlikely event of production being cut short, we have enough existing material to bridge any gaps and complete the film
the ""lo-fi"" nature of the documentary makes shooting flexible;  for the majority of our locations there are no rental costs to worry about in the event of running behind schedule

<h1>What's the project? </h1>
<div>This summer, Fly Away will go to <b>Ireland. </b>Discorvering this mythical land, these landmarks shaped by lengends, the country of Guiness, shamrock and leprechaun.

<div>You want to discover Ireland and its charming landmarks by staying in your living room? Fly Away offers you this chance! Adventures, events, discoveries, unusual and incredible, fun and emotional meetings will be posted on our Youtube channel. A series of short thematic documentaries will be shot too. They will allow you to get to know with Irish people, their culture and their landmarks, throughout interviews, vox pops, discovering videos, ... </div>

<p><b>Fly Away</b>, ce sont <u>deux jeunes</u> de 20 et 23
ans qui ont décidé de <i>partir à la
découverte d’une monde</i> qui est en train de disparaître, d’un monde qui
regorge d’endroits exceptionnels, d’un monde qui a aussi besoin d’aide, d’un monde
qui crie, pleure, saigne et qui pourtant ne reçoit rien. </p>
<p><b>Fly Away</b> ce sont des <i>rencontres inoubliables</i>, des découvertes
inattendues, des lieux incontournables, des personnalités généreuses. </p>
<p><b>Fly Away</b>, c’est le projet ambitieux de <u>changer
les choses</u>, d’apporter un peu de lumière dans les yeux des gens, de baume
au cœur. </p>

les unes que les autres. Une chaîne où se rencontrent documentaires, défis,
vidéos de voyages, … </p>
<p><b>Fly Away</b>, c’est aussi une <u>communauté</u>
grandissante de citoyens du monde qui peuvent <i>échanger</i> via des plateformes sociales comme Facebook ou Twitter. </p>
<p><b>Fly Away</b>, c’est également une <i>page Instagram</i> de <u>photos époustouflantes</u>, émouvantes et
inspirantes. </p>

What's the project? 
This summer, Fly Away will go to Ireland. Discorvering this mythical land, these landmarks shaped by lengends, the country of Guiness, shamrock and leprechaun. But they won't be travelling by car, nor by foot, Fly Away will be crossing this country with fifty shades of green on bikes, with only muscle power. 
You want to discover Ireland and its charming landmarks by staying in your living room? Fly Away offers you this chance! Adventures, events, discoveries, unusual and incredible, fun and emotional meetings will be posted on our Youtube channel. A series of short thematic documentaries will be shot too. They will allow you to get to know with Irish people, their culture and their landmarks, throughout interviews, vox pops, discovering videos, ... 
However, this project is impossible without you! It remains a part of gear to buy. That's why appeal your help! 

Who are we?    

Fly Away, it's two young people of 20 and 23 that have decided to go discovering a world that is disappearing, a world that is full of remarkable places, a world that needs help, a world that cries, shouts, bleeds but doesn't receive anything.  
Fly Away, it's unbelievable meetings, unexpected discoveries, unavoidable places, generous people.  
Fly Away, it's the ambitious goal to change things, to bring a little bit of light in people's eyes, to warm people's hearts. 
Fly Away, it's also a Youtube channel which will quickly fill up of various types of videos. A channel where documentaries meet challenges and travel videos, ... 
Fly Away, it's also a growing community of world citizen that can exchange through social networks such as Facebook or Twitter. 
Fly Away, it's also an Istagram account full of mind-blowing, emotional and inspiring pictures.

After a few days in the Connemara, we cycle back to Galway, where wi stay 2 days before going to Dublin. Perhaps, we may go to the Wicklow Mountains Nation Park.

Quel est notre projet?

Cet été, Fly Away mettra le cap sur l'Irlande. A la
découverte de cette terre mythique, de ces paysages
façonnés par les légendes, du pays de la Guiness, du trèfle et des lutins.
Mais ce n'est pas en voiture, ni à pied que Fly Away parcourra le pays aux 50
nuances de verts mais bien sur des vélos, à la force de leurs mollets.
Vous avez envie de découvrir l'Irlande et ses paysages enchanteurs tout en
restant dans votre salon? Fly Away vous en offre la possibilité! Les aventures, péripéties, découvertes,
rencontres insolites et incroyables, amusantes et émouvantes seront publiées
sur la chaîne Youtube. Une série de documentaires thématiques seront
également réalisés.  Ils vous permettront
de vous familiariser avec les Irlandais, leur culture et leurs paysages, à
travers des interviews, des micros-trottoirs, des vidéos découvertes… Cependant,
ce projet est impossible sans vous! Il reste une partie du matériel à acquérir.
C'est pourquoi nous faisons appel à vous! 



Qui sommes-nous? 


Fly Away, ce sont deux jeunes de 20 et 23
ans qui ont décidé de partir à la
découverte d’une monde qui est en train de disparaître, d’un monde qui
regorge d’endroits exceptionnels, d’un monde qui a aussi besoin d’aide, d’un monde
qui crie, pleure, saigne et qui pourtant ne reçoit rien. 
Fly Away ce sont des rencontres inoubliables, des découvertes
inattendues, des lieux incontournables, des personnalités généreuses. 
Fly Away, c’est le projet ambitieux de changer
les choses, d’apporter un peu de lumière dans les yeux des gens, de baume
au cœur. 
Fly Away, c’est aussi une chaîne Youtube qui va bien vite se remplir de vidéos plus variées
les unes que les autres. Une chaîne où se rencontrent documentaires, défis,
vidéos de voyages, … 
Fly Away, c’est aussi une communauté
grandissante de citoyens du monde qui peuvent échanger via des plateformes sociales comme Facebook ou Twitter. 
Fly Away, c’est également une page Instagram de photos époustouflantes, émouvantes et
inspirantes. 


L’itinéraire : 
Nous arriverons à Cork et
de là débutera notre périple. Nous nous dirigerons vers le sud et puis longerons la côte jusqu’à la pointe ouest. Nous remonterons ensuite vers le Connemara, toujours
en longeant la côte. Nous ferons une incursion dans le pays pour visiter le parc national de Killarney. Nous
passerons par le Ring of Kerry, la Péninsule de Dingle et les Cliff of Moher. Après quelques jours
passés dans le Connemara, nous
redescendrons vers Galway. Nous y
resterons 2 jours avant d’aller visiter la capitale, Dublin. Peut-être irons-nous jusqu’au parc national des montagnes de Wicklow.L’itinéraire définitif
sera mis à jour sur notre page facebook. Vous pourrez également suivre nos différentes étapes sur les différents réseaux

GAME DAY is a science fiction short film, which explores a possible future...
When the Neo Social Party finally get into Government, they enforce a radical new way of life. It's heinously controversial. It's certainly brutal. But it is fair.


It's a system you would never want, but actually has a brilliant idea trapped inside it.
In a world where life can be grossly unjust, the film asks a fascinating question: What would it really mean for life to be truly fair?
It follows the thrilling story of Jeremy coming face to face with this mysterious, totalitarian system. And leaves us with plenty to ponder as to how we might reduce the inequalities in society today.




The Vision for the Film!








London in the near future. After constant riots and unrest, the old government is thrown out - and supplanted by a radical new system. It is meant to make life fair for all its citizens. But as 40 year old Jeremy prepares to find out his fate, the grim reality of it unfolds...









Game Day is the exciting short film that tells the story of this world.


This combines the futurism of Prometheus and Avatar with thought-provoking high concepts akin to Minority Report and Clockwork Orange​.





It's the tale of a radical reaction to social injustice. A new world order. But with all radical solutions, there comes a price.






It follows the story of Jeremy as he tries to escape the brutal fairness that is meted out to everyone. It is a story that explores a very innovative blending of capitalism with communism, in a totalitarian state. It explores what a truly fair society might be and whether it could work. And it follows Jeremy's personal journey as he tries to protect himself from the system, and what happens - both for the bad and for the good.

This is the story of our not-so distant future.

The script has already been written. It's 8 pages, which approximately translates to an 8 or 9 minute film. This offers an exciting opening into a world that can be explored in a longer form (feature length or web/TV-series), which we'll be developing once the short film has been completed.

The intended shoot period is August 2015, over 4 days - including night-time riots scenes; Jeremy's arrest and evasion scenes; the high-tech sci-fi ""God's Room"" where justice is meted out; and then the future world that Jeremy finds himself in.

<p>The project is being directed by Wes Miller, a former trial attorney turned Writer-Director. Wes accepted Christ, was baptized at and attended Bellevue Baptist under Adrian Rodgers until leaving Memphis for college. Since making the transition to Writer-Director two years ago, he has sold his first screenplay and co-produced a film distributed by Lionsgate. This first film was written as a faith based thriller, but Hollywood ripped out that message. Recently, he took a script to a well known producer who offered to make the movie so long as he included nudity and sex. He refused and decided enough was enough. PRAYER NEVER FAILS is his third feature film and first feature as Writer-Director. This film marks his steps into his true calling as a filmmaker: glorify the Lord with quality storytelling.</p>

As a player he was competitively driven, but as a coach Aiden knows it is more about the souls on his team than the outcome of the game. One of Coach Aiden’s players, Kurt, comes to Aiden for help because of personal problems at home. Aiden feels moved by the Holy Spirit to teach the young man to pray. They get down on their knees and pray together. The boy’s father learns of Coach Aiden praying with his son and goes ballistic. He reports Aiden to the public school authorities, leading to Aiden being fired as head coach.Facing this adversity to his faith, Aiden struggles in prayer to know whether he should fight the school board or walk away from his beloved team. Nearly broke, he hires Michael, a gifted trial attorney who (unbeknownst to Aiden) is stricken with a severe addiction to gambling and a complete lack of faith in God.The Story of Our ProjectHello, my name is Scott and I am here to tell you about a film we’re creating called, “Prayer Never Fails.” My business partner, Wes, and I are launching this campaign to raise funds and we would love your support and involvement in creating this feature film. Our political system requires that there be a separation of church and state.

Family Films Matter
We are here to send a message.  We want quality stories without having to worry about over-sexualization and language in a film. It is not a new fact that society has changed
dramatically since we removed prayer from the school.  
Since the 1962 Supreme Court decision in Engel v. Vitale, 370 U.S. 421 (1962), we have seen several later laws passed that have given rise to a general loss of Christian values in society. If we sit by and do nothing this trend will no doubt continue. 
There is a long standing attack on prayer in schools!



Why Indiegogo? — The films I’m driven to create for Christ are not within the scope of Hollywood projects, I will not water down the Gospel. That’s why I’m utilizing Indiegogo — because I know people want to see thoughtful, ambitious Christian cinema that breaks out from the constraints of traditional genres.
Shooting outside of L.A. and in a state without tax credits creates an additional burden on the production. We are hoping to offset these losses by early involvement into the film!

<p>Kent State
University Independent Films (KSUIF) is an organization fueled by students’
<b>passion</b> for film. In 2008, professors Traci E. Williams and David Smeltzer
collaborated to create this wonderful program that is designed to give students <b>real-world</b>
film experience. Since then, there are more than 100 people now involved in KSUIF.</p>
<p>KSUIF has since
produced TV shows, short films, music videos, and <b>three</b> feature length films:
“Breaking News,"" a national award winner, “Research: The Musical,"" an all-out
musical with original songs all written by students, and “Hell at Heathridge,"" a horrifying film that will scare you out of your seat. </p>
<p>Our current
project, “Unlucky”, is set to premiere in May 2016. Our entire crew is very
excited to begin working on this film. Each and every student, graduate
student, and volunteer is ready to spend countless hours on this film. </p>

<p>KSUIF is a
<i>financially independent organization</i> and we receive very little to no funding from

contributions will be very much appreciated and will go towards
state-of-the-art cameras, lighting, electrical equipment, audio, special

Unlucky
is a film that is extremely important to every single person on our cast and
crew. We all have invested so much of our time and effort to make sure that
this film happens. There are multiple challenges that we will have to overcome,
such as finding the correct locations to shoot for the film. The crew is also
preparing and testing camera techniques in order to avoid any problems that may
arise during production and postproduction. Our team is also working diligently to
market this film and create buzz surrounding the film. To get the word out
about this film may be our toughest obstacle. As college students, we need the
distribution of the film to be abundant. After completing the film, we do plan
on entering as many competitions and film festivals as possible in order to reach maximum distribution. <br/></p>

</div></div>","Short Summary

When
boy and girl fall in love at first sight, it’s not always as magical as a fairy
tale. Without even learning her name, Sam must face the unluckiest situations
in order to reunite with his love before it’s too late.





Kent State
University Independent Films (KSUIF) is an organization fueled by students’
passion for film. In 2008, professors Traci E. Williams and David Smeltzer
collaborated to create this wonderful program that is designed to give students real-world
film experience. Since then, there are more than 100 people now involved in KSUIF.
KSUIF has since
produced TV shows, short films, music videos, and three feature length films:
“Breaking News,"" a national award winner, “Research: The Musical,"" an all-out
musical with original songs all written by students, and “Hell at Heathridge,"" a horrifying film that will scare you out of your seat. 
Our current
project, “Unlucky”, is set to premiere in May 2016. Our entire crew is very
excited to begin working on this film. Each and every student, graduate
student, and volunteer is ready to spend countless hours on this film. 






KSUIF is a
financially independent organization and we receive very little to no funding from
our university. Our project depends on generous donations from people like you.
With your help and your support, we can make “Unlucky” happen! 
Our goal is to raise $10,000 from this campaign. Your
contributions will be very much appreciated and will go towards
state-of-the-art cameras, lighting, electrical equipment, audio, special
effects, locations, wardrobe, feeding our hardworking cast/crew during our film
sessions, and more!

As you can see, we do have wonderful perks for donating to us! They can range from $1 and receive a thank you note from the cast & crew to $2,000 and receive Executive Producer credit in the film!

The 2nd convention donated $2500 and with matching funds, raised $4500 for All Children's Hospital through the Children's Miracle Network Hospitals.This year, the Grand Brony Gala will be hosting its third annual convention, from July 10-12, 2015, also located at the Embassy Suites Tampa - USF near Busch Gardens in Tampa, FL. Attendees will get to meet special guests, including actor John de Lancie, composer Daniel Ingram and writer Dave Polsky, experience concerts, shows, games, karaoke, and a variety of panels. Dozens of artists and vendors will be in attendance to show off their creations and wares, from commissioned artwork and prints, to plush ponies and jewelry. To top it all off, the Grand Brony Gala cast presents two original, live stage productions, including immersing the guests in the Grand Galloping Gala experience: ""Panic at the Gala: Don't Feed the Plants"".

</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>This
year’s Festival is right around the corner, August 28-30, and to support the
monstrous undertaking we've launched our $17k in 17 Days Campaign, with a goal
of raising $17,000 in just 17 short days. 
It’s important to note that ticket sales only cover about 1/3 of the
costs associated with hosting the Fest so we depend on grants, corporate
sponsorships and donations from people just like you to make it all happen, and
at an affordable price for our community. </p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>
</p>
<p>We need to raise $17,000 in 17 days from you, our super fans, our volunteers, our bestie friends so that this year’s Festival can be the best yet. Giving is pretty simple &amp; every gift of $17 or more will get you a customized Sidewalk Haiku (Haikus contain 17 syllables, get it?) from the Sidewalk family or alumni filmmakers. And when you give, we invite you to share a Sidewalk Haiku of your own with us- we’ll be doing something special with the 17 best at this year’s Fest. </p>
<p>The funds raised during this campaign will help us bring the
artists and filmmakers whose films will screen at our Festival to Birmingham so
that they may participate in question and answer sessions following the
screening of their films, lead workshops and/or participate in panels. Visiting
artists/filmmakers also interact with local filmmakers, developing meaningful
professional relationships. This engagement between filmmakers and audiences is
a vital part of the film festival experience, setting it apart from viewing
films at home or in the typical multi-plex setting. Funds raised will cover airfare, mileage, and lodging for out of state filmmakers. </p>

<div>
<b>""The Couple""</b> is a feature film that chronicles a day in the life of Donald and Phyllis Chambers, an elderly husband and wife. The film examines the deterioration of their relationship, both past and present, as a series of issues set in motion decades prior all come to the surface on a single day.</div>
<div>There are six characters total in the film: <b>Donald</b>, <b>Phyllis</b>, <b>Julie</b>, <b>Ryan</b>, <b>Harry</b>, and <b>Mia</b>. Each character is essential to the film and serves the narrative and the character development.</div>
<div>
<b>Donald</b> is a retired professor of English. He lives in New York City with <b>Phyllis</b> who was an aspiring artist before taking a job as an administrator. Now that both Donald and Phyllis are retired, they are forced to spend all of their time together in the apartment, creating a tension that serves as a catalyst for the entire film. <b>Julie</b>, their daughter, visits in the morning and has a long and revealing conversation with Donald and Phyllis. Through their interactions, we come to understand more about their familial dynamics as well as their personal motivations.</div><div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431525059/mt6ztzm42dhksdqpaiqz.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p></div><div>
<b>Ryan</b> is a young professional that lives in the same apartment building as the Chambers. Donald and Ryan share a short, but important conversation that allows the audience to glimpse a different shade of Donald and understand him professionally and personally.</div>
<div>Finally, <b>Harry</b> and <b>Mia</b> are old friends of Donald and Phyllis that visit for a lunch in which they share very intimate and honest conversations. Harry and Mia serve as a marital reflection to Donald and Phyllis and allow the audience to gain richer insights into the characters and narrative.</div><div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431525251/ezmwk5yiajge334jhuz9.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p></div><h4>Why so small?</h4>
<div>We seem to have come to a point in cinema where studios and audiences alike seem to agree bigger is better.</div>

We hope that within a year and a half to two years, ""The Couple"" is on all streaming sites (Netflix, Hulu, etc.) so that the widest possible audience can find the film and appreciate it.What if we don't reach our goal?If we don't reach our goal, we'll start cutting our budget and try to secure the rest of our budget or get closer to our $40,000 price point. At the end of the day, I'm making this movie. If I have to do it on a cheaper camera with no-name actors that we've auditioned, then we'll do it, but this movie will get made.Thank you for checking out my campaign! I hope that you can help me make this film!",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

Follow different characters down rabbit holes throughout a dreamland that can quickly shift into a nightmare, where nothing makes sense but everything feels familiar. 
Co-created by Liz Tabish and Anthony David Montanino, the first season of Portal web series has met with extraordinary reviews. But we need your help to create the second season and beyond. Check out www.portalwebseries.com to experience what people are talking about.
""The shorts (in Portal) use music, minimalistic but psychologically rich dialogue, surreal imagery, and a growing sense of narrative tension to create a singular impression of a world both strikingly similar and disturbingly divergent from our own...The PORTAL series is the expression of a unique and powerful voice, one that could prove potentially revolutionary in the American filmmaking scene."" - Reviewed by Eric England   What We Need & What You Get

Guest Cinematographer, Mat Miller +
As an accomplished life-long visualist, Miller has captured the ethos of the Oklahoma art scene since the early 2000s. Whether it’s still, motion or animation, Miller has created an artistic periscope for viewing a 21st century world that lives and dies by the bible of mass media.

Miller has worked with Liz Tabish on five films and helped her produce a series of Shakespearean tragedies. Miller owes his success to his dog, Roger, who speaks to him after smoking trees.

My name is Valiant and I'm glad to announce that I will be going to Northern Thailand for a mission's trip July this year. For four weeks, I will be part of a team that will be reaching out to youth at the Chiang-Khong Christian Education Centre (CCEC).

<p><b>THE PROJECT - a queer futuristic-punk-boat movie</b><br/></p>
<p>Ana arrives in a town in the middle of Brasil carrying the ashes of her queer activist brother who has just being murdered. In order to honor his memory she throws his ashes in a beautiful waterfall from the place he was fighting to preserve. As Ana is not able to leave the place, the spirit of her brother Sebastian appears to her. Resisting the pressure of her job and wife to go back to São Paulo, Ana, accompanied by her brother’s ghost, journeys through the Amazon collecting the oral memory from their ancestors.</p>
</div><div>On a political note, the character will interact with a strong problem of boarders that defines Brazilian society now days. Where indigenous populations are more and more restricted from their space and being removed from their ancestors' land.</div><div>
<p><span>In a hybrid fiction-documentary film the character is faced with life changing situations and people, who makes Ana question their own identity.</span></p>
<p>When you take a trip like this you start to uncover your different selves. Are we not the reflection of the other, and because of that the other itself? Or our particular world is so deep and unique that it looses itself in it’s own unconscious?</p>
<p>Playing with mythological creatures, this magical realistic feature will explore the concepts of polyamory, queer, gender, spirituality and physical frontiers. All embedded in a strong political and loving piece.</p>

<p><b>O PROJETO - um filme queer-futurista-punk</b></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span></p>Ana chega em uma cidade no meio do Brasil levando as cinzas de seu irmão ativista e queer que acaba de ser assassinado. A fim de honrar a memória de seu irmão ela joga suas cinzas em uma bela cachoeira no lugar em que ele estava lutando para preservar. Quando Ana não é capaz de deixar a cidade, o espírito de seu irmão Sebastian aparece para ela. Resistindo à pressão de seu trabalho e esposa para voltar à São Paulo, Ana, acompanhada pelo fantasma de seu irmão, viaja através da Amazônia coletando a memória oral de seus ancestrais.</div><div>
<p>Em uma nota política, o personagem vai interagir com um forte problema de fronteiras que define a sociedade brasileira hoje dias. Onde as populações indígenas estão cada vez mais restritas de seus espaços e removidas da terra de seus ancestrais.</p>
<p>Em um filme híbrido entre ficção e documentário o personagem se depara com situações e pessoas que mudam seu destino e fazem Ana questionar sua própria identidade.</p>
<p>Quando você faz uma viagem como essa, você começa a descobrir seus diferentes eus. Não somos o reflexo do outro, e por causa disso o próprio outro? Ou nosso mundo particular é tão profundo e único que ele perde-se em seu próprio inconsciente?</p>
<p>Contando histórias de criaturas mitológicas, o filme terá uma característica mágica e irá explorar conceitos de poliamor, queer, sexualidade, espiritualidade e fronteiras físicas. Tudo incorporado em uma obra fortemente política e amorosa.</p>

THE PROJECT - a queer futuristic-punk-boat movie
Ana arrives in a town in the middle of Brasil carrying the ashes of her queer activist brother who has just being murdered. In order to honor his memory she throws his ashes in a beautiful waterfall from the place he was fighting to preserve. As Ana is not able to leave the place, the spirit of her brother Sebastian appears to her. Resisting the pressure of her job and wife to go back to São Paulo, Ana, accompanied by her brother’s ghost, journeys through the Amazon collecting the oral memory from their ancestors.
On a political note, the character will interact with a strong problem of boarders that defines Brazilian society now days. Where indigenous populations are more and more restricted from their space and being removed from their ancestors' land.
In a hybrid fiction-documentary film the character is faced with life changing situations and people, who makes Ana question their own identity.
When you take a trip like this you start to uncover your different selves. Are we not the reflection of the other, and because of that the other itself? Or our particular world is so deep and unique that it looses itself in it’s own unconscious?
Playing with mythological creatures, this magical realistic feature will explore the concepts of polyamory, queer, gender, spirituality and physical frontiers. All embedded in a strong political and loving piece.



O PROJETO - um filme queer-futurista-punk
Ana chega em uma cidade no meio do Brasil levando as cinzas de seu irmão ativista e queer que acaba de ser assassinado. A fim de honrar a memória de seu irmão ela joga suas cinzas em uma bela cachoeira no lugar em que ele estava lutando para preservar. Quando Ana não é capaz de deixar a cidade, o espírito de seu irmão Sebastian aparece para ela. Resistindo à pressão de seu trabalho e esposa para voltar à São Paulo, Ana, acompanhada pelo fantasma de seu irmão, viaja através da Amazônia coletando a memória oral de seus ancestrais.
Em uma nota política, o personagem vai interagir com um forte problema de fronteiras que define a sociedade brasileira hoje dias. Onde as populações indígenas estão cada vez mais restritas de seus espaços e removidas da terra de seus ancestrais.
Em um filme híbrido entre ficção e documentário o personagem se depara com situações e pessoas que mudam seu destino e fazem Ana questionar sua própria identidade.
Quando você faz uma viagem como essa, você começa a descobrir seus diferentes eus. Não somos o reflexo do outro, e por causa disso o próprio outro? Ou nosso mundo particular é tão profundo e único que ele perde-se em seu próprio inconsciente?
Contando histórias de criaturas mitológicas, o filme terá uma característica mágica e irá explorar conceitos de poliamor, queer, sexualidade, espiritualidade e fronteiras físicas. Tudo incorporado em uma obra fortemente política e amorosa.

Algumas das questões políticas realmente importantes que queremos documentar em nosso filme!


Spiritual practices
As a practitioner myself, carried on by my ancestors. I hope to be a voice that advocates for the space of this religious practice that suffers a lot of prejudice in Brazil.
Práticas espirituais
Como praticante, conectada com meus antepassados. Eu espero ser uma voz que defende  o espaço desta prática religiosa que sofre muito preconceito no Brasil.

Queer issues
As gender queer people, we plan on advocating for non-western concepts of queer identities. Having the lead character challenge the idea of normalized sexual and gender definitions, we will explore the concepts of polyamory, gender and queerness within non western communities.

Questões Queer
Como pessoas queer, planejamos apresentar conceitos não-ocidentais da identidades queer. Com o personagem principal desafiando a idéia de definições normalizadas a respeito da sexualidade e gênero, vamos explorar os conceitos de poliamor, gênero e queer em comunidades não ocidentais.
FIERCE!!! Just like how we are gonna make this happen!

We are making the film very frugally but to the highest professional standards, and it is being run as a <b>'NOT FOR PROFIT'</b> project, so Stitching Pictures is NOT making any money from it.<p></p>
<p>Funds raised will help to pay to send a small documentary team to various locations to capture the documentary's principal footage. The funds will also be used to help finance professional editing and colour grading to be applied to the film, making it more likely to be acquired by television channels and reach a larger audience. </p>

The film already has some private funding raised and this crowdfunding campaign has been set up to pay for some of the essential costs of the documentary. We are making the film very frugally but to the highest professional standards, and it is being run as a 'NOT FOR PROFIT' project, so Stitching Pictures is NOT making any money from it.
Funds raised will help to pay to send a small documentary team to various locations to capture the documentary's principal footage. The funds will also be used to help finance professional editing and colour grading to be applied to the film, making it more likely to be acquired by television channels and reach a larger audience. 





What you get in return:

We hope that giving to this documentary crowdfunding campaign is done out of benevolence, however, we also want to say thank you to those who do give. 
We aren't going to make a tonne of merchandise to give away, but we will give what we think our donors will appreciate, including:



Exclusive access to 'Behind the Scenes' footage and photographs


Free digital copies of the film


Official film credits 


The opportunity to meet the team and discuss the project


And other relevant thank you gifts



You also get the satisfaction of helping to create a film that could potentially save someones life, or be that first inspiration to make a change to their life. 
We are pretty sure that no 'gift' can match that!

<p></p>
<p></p>As a filmmaker I believe that films should focus beyond the realm of story and characters, and should be the medium of dramatization of ideas and arguments. Movies tend to be more timeless when that’s done because they don’t become prisoners of the period they’re made.<br/><br/>In the midst of its sometimes absurdist and often times nostalgic and romantic revenge story, I AM JOE is about the dichotomy between the strength of faith and taking charge of your destiny, because you believe in what’s beyond the darkness versus the weakness in rationality and becoming a victim of circumstances, due to fear. Hence, in essence, I AM JOE is about the plight that most artists feel, but told in an entertaining way.<br/><br/>This movie was shot for about ten weeks, only on weekends, with a very small crew and cast. We had very little resources as well. Though it is an experience that will hopefully never need to be repeated, it’s something that I will forever cherish. The bonds, the memories, the lessons learned all occurred because of such a unique situation we've been fortunate enough to experience. It was a labor of love for everyone involved and I’m eternally grateful for them being a part of the dream.<br/><br/>Despite the painful process to get the film done and whatever flaws it might have, it’s something I'm proud of. I hope that it becomes an example to young  filmmakers that with hard work, some ingenuity and being oblivious to what can, and will go wrong, you’ll beat the odds and make a feature film.<br/><br/><p></p>

An NYU Quantum Physics professor with an ordinary life. Joe wakes up every morning and takes medication before going to work. This is his daily routine, until it's ruined by Nacho, the leader of a Kaballah conspiracy gang in Los Angeles.<br/></p>One night, Nacho breaks into Joe’s apartment and drugs him.

<p>A jack-of-all-trades, Pedro is the Director, Writer, Executive
Producer and Editor of the film. This is his first feature length
film and his most ambitious project to date. The idea of the film
came to Pedro after his experiences as a film student at the School
of Visual Arts in NYC and during his time in Los Angeles. Pedro
originally hails from Brazil, but moved to Texas with his family when
he was child. His many experiences in those places and his diverse background have shaped his
view of the world. Film has played an integral part of his world view as well. He's drawn from his
inspirations from Sergio Leone to Woody Allen to Kim Jee-woon.
Although Pedro is  young and green, he's got several short film
projects and commercials under his belt. He's also written three
feature length scripts; one of which is in development.

<p>
</p><p>During their time at School of Visual Arts, Pedro and
Tanaya bonded over their love for film. Tanaya specialized in line producing and editing at SVA. While still in school, she had the opportunity to learn
from many Film Producers as an intern and worked on her first feature
film, Broken City. It was then that she grew more and more fascinated
by producing. For several years Tanaya continued to work in post
production at companies like Viacom and NBC Universal, but her
passion for producing still lingered. The opportunity to finally
produce her own feature film came when Pedro approached her about a
year ago with the intention of making an ambitious, but low budget
indie film entitled I AM JOE. It was then that Tanaya took on that
task of scheduling, budgeting, and being a liaison between the
director's creative vision and all the muddy details of the film
business. <br/></p><p><br/></p>

the role as Joe, but he's also our multi-gifted Associate Producer.
When he's not looking fabulous on camera, he's producing his own
projects. He's produced over 10 films and some television series as
part of the Producer's Guild of America. He's currently working on
his documentary film AMERICAN JEDI about real-life Jedi. Several of
his projects have been in film festivals such as Cannes Film Festival
in France. Laurent attended the prestigious film institute at USC and
is part of the Group 101 Filmmakers Alliance. </p><p><br/></p><p><b>ZOLTAN SANDORS</b></p><p><b></b></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1181188/files/20150128234839-1122b72.jpg?1422517719"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><br/></p><p>With a keen eye for the aesthetics of film, Zoltan gravitated to cinemtography early on and has since directed, produced, and shot several short films of his own including his most recent film ALIEN JACK HUNTER.

been trying to get money to fund for some of our post production expenses. We need
re-recording in outside scenes that don't sound too great and
sweetening of the sound altogether. In addition to that, we also need
someone who can compose an original soundtrack because as much as
we'd like to pay for rights and clearances for cool music that you
can hear on the radio, that's a lot of money. A more affordable
alternative is hiring a talented composer to create original
music. Sound is at least 50% of the film so without good sound it would ruin its value.   <br/></p><p>The other part of our funding campaign is marketing and
distribution. We want people to be able to see the finished product
with mastered sound, color, visual effects, and music on the big
screen. With that comes the necessity to travel both locally and
internationally to screen at film festivals across the world. Things
like festival submission fees and travel expenses can be pricey, so
we've allotted some room in our budget for those.<br/></p><h3></h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1180151/files/20150128115525-WHERE_IS_THE_MONEY_GOING_TO.png?1422474925"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

</p></div>","As a filmmaker I believe that films should focus beyond the realm of story and characters, and should be the medium of dramatization of ideas and arguments. Movies tend to be more timeless when that’s done because they don’t become prisoners of the period they’re made.In the midst of its sometimes absurdist and often times nostalgic and romantic revenge story, I AM JOE is about the dichotomy between the strength of faith and taking charge of your destiny, because you believe in what’s beyond the darkness versus the weakness in rationality and becoming a victim of circumstances, due to fear. Hence, in essence, I AM JOE is about the plight that most artists feel, but told in an entertaining way.This movie was shot for about ten weeks, only on weekends, with a very small crew and cast. We had very little resources as well. Though it is an experience that will hopefully never need to be repeated, it’s something that I will forever cherish. The bonds, the memories, the lessons learned all occurred because of such a unique situation we've been fortunate enough to experience. It was a labor of love for everyone involved and I’m eternally grateful for them being a part of the dream.Despite the painful process to get the film done and whatever flaws it might have, it’s something I'm proud of. I hope that it becomes an example to young  filmmakers that with hard work, some ingenuity and being oblivious to what can, and will go wrong, you’ll beat the odds and make a feature film.


Meet Joe. An NYU Quantum Physics professor with an ordinary life. Joe wakes up every morning and takes medication before going to work. This is his daily routine, until it's ruined by Nacho, the leader of a Kaballah conspiracy gang in Los Angeles.One night, Nacho breaks into Joe’s apartment and drugs him. Afterward, Joe dreams of being in a desert and confronting Jack who bears a striking resemblance to Joe...The next morning, Joe wakes up and his medication doesn’t work as well. During class he starts to feel strong headaches and passes out. Eventually it dawns on him what has happened and he decides to pay Nacho a visit...The film is a revenge flick, but more complex than many others of its kind in that it includes Jewish mysticism, Quantum Physic theories, and a bunch of other really nerdy things. Oh, and a Peta joke. 
Exhibit A:(Yeah, we weren't kidding. +1 for dad humor.) 
PEDRO BARON


A jack-of-all-trades, Pedro is the Director, Writer, Executive
Producer and Editor of the film. This is his first feature length
film and his most ambitious project to date. The idea of the film
came to Pedro after his experiences as a film student at the School
of Visual Arts in NYC and during his time in Los Angeles. Pedro
originally hails from Brazil, but moved to Texas with his family when
he was child. His many experiences in those places and his diverse background have shaped his
view of the world. Film has played an integral part of his world view as well. He's drawn from his
inspirations from Sergio Leone to Woody Allen to Kim Jee-woon.
Although Pedro is  young and green, he's got several short film
projects and commercials under his belt. He's also written three
feature length scripts; one of which is in development. 

TANAYA RIVERS

During their time at School of Visual Arts, Pedro and
Tanaya bonded over their love for film. Tanaya specialized in line producing and editing at SVA. While still in school, she had the opportunity to learn
from many Film Producers as an intern and worked on her first feature
film, Broken City. It was then that she grew more and more fascinated
by producing. For several years Tanaya continued to work in post
production at companies like Viacom and NBC Universal, but her
passion for producing still lingered. The opportunity to finally
produce her own feature film came when Pedro approached her about a
year ago with the intention of making an ambitious, but low budget
indie film entitled I AM JOE. It was then that Tanaya took on that
task of scheduling, budgeting, and being a liaison between the
director's creative vision and all the muddy details of the film
business. 
LAURENT MALAQUAIS You may recognize that face...that's because he stars in
the role as Joe, but he's also our multi-gifted Associate Producer.
When he's not looking fabulous on camera, he's producing his own
projects. He's produced over 10 films and some television series as
part of the Producer's Guild of America. He's currently working on
his documentary film AMERICAN JEDI about real-life Jedi. Several of
his projects have been in film festivals such as Cannes Film Festival
in France. Laurent attended the prestigious film institute at USC and
is part of the Group 101 Filmmakers Alliance. ZOLTAN SANDORSWith a keen eye for the aesthetics of film, Zoltan gravitated to cinemtography early on and has since directed, produced, and shot several short films of his own including his most recent film ALIEN JACK HUNTER. He worked on I AM JOE as both the Director of Photography and Associate Producer. He excels at 
creating deep, rich imagery whilst working very closely with the director
 to create a picture as close to the vision as possible. The film is nearly complete, but our biggest hurdle thus far has
been trying to get money to fund for some of our post production expenses. We need
re-recording in outside scenes that don't sound too great and
sweetening of the sound altogether. In addition to that, we also need
someone who can compose an original soundtrack because as much as
we'd like to pay for rights and clearances for cool music that you
can hear on the radio, that's a lot of money. A more affordable
alternative is hiring a talented composer to create original
music. Sound is at least 50% of the film so without good sound it would ruin its value.   The other part of our funding campaign is marketing and
distribution. We want people to be able to see the finished product
with mastered sound, color, visual effects, and music on the big
screen. With that comes the necessity to travel both locally and
internationally to screen at film festivals across the world. Things
like festival submission fees and travel expenses can be pricey, so
we've allotted some room in our budget for those.
Post Production expenses include:
   •  RE-RECORDING VOCALS/ADR   • 
SOUND EDITING/MIX   •  SOUND EFFECT PURCHASES 
 •  ORIGINAL MUSIC SCORE
Marketing and Distribution expenses include: 
   •  FESTIVAL SUBMISSION FEES 
 •  DELIVERABLES (DVD'S, PRESS  BOOK, SHIPPING COSTS)   •  OUTREACH 
 •  FESTIVAL TRAVEL & LIVING  • 
MOVIE POSTERSThe following are estimates based on our budget. If we don't reach our goal, all the money that is earned through here will go to any immediate post production and distribution expenses, however every amount accounted for here is needed to get the film completed and seen. Since this is a donation, you won't be receiving any earnings back from the film, but you will be receiving the perks on the side if you so choose and you will have our sincere gratitude. 
STRETCH IT OUT
Stretch goals are basically the goals beyond our current goal.
Since the present goal is primarily for post production and
marketing, any money that surpasses the current goal will then be
used to pay for expensive things like legal fees.
We've been lucky in that all our talented cast and crew have
worked on deferred basis, but we'd love to pay them. They've put

day jobs! They've done so much to help get this film made, and they

<br/><p>Beaumont is first and foremost a story of self-acceptance. A serious issue across not only the United States, but the world, bullying affects millions of people every day. It has traditionally been represented from the victims' point of view, often times with a schoolmate who taunts and teases. </p>
<p>But Beaumont is a story from the point of view that hasn't been told. Don't get it wrong, no part of Beaumont will justify bullying. But every aspect of bullying should be explored in order to understand not just the bully themselves, but the environment that creates them. </p>
<p>Furthermore, Beaumont is an eye-opening story about a girl who made a mistake and has to deal with the aftermath of the wrongs she has committed.</p>

</div></div>","BY:ArtisTree Productions is an award-winning group of filmmakers from Atlanta, Ga. We created our first short film, Red River Ode, in 2013 for the 2nd Annual Louisiana Film Prize and exceeded all expectations when we placed in the initial Top 20 and consequently 4th Place over-all with only a mere $700.00 budget. We won a $3,000.00 grant through the Founders Circle Award which led to our second short film, The Ninth, which once again placed in the Top 20 for the 2014 Louisiana Film Prize and is currently in the festival circuit.In 2014 we gave everything we had to producing The Ninth in order to make it the film it needed to be. Unfortunately, the entire budget was financed through out of pocket expenses from us, the filmmakers, as we did not have the cash on-hand to pay towards the grant. We went broke, lost our jobs and jeopardized our relationships to make the film happen. This time we're taking the crowdfunding route in order to make Beaumont not only the best it can be, but a film that invests into the people who support it and to the community it seeks to help.Below you will learn what Beaumont is, why it's a story that needs to be told and how you can help to make it a reality.Beaumont is the story of Katie Blackwell, a teenage girl struggling to come to terms with herself after she and her friends bullied another girl to suicide and the media frenzy that comes after. 
Beaumont is first and foremost a story of self-acceptance. A serious issue across not only the United States, but the world, bullying affects millions of people every day. It has traditionally been represented from the victims' point of view, often times with a schoolmate who taunts and teases. 
But Beaumont is a story from the point of view that hasn't been told. Don't get it wrong, no part of Beaumont will justify bullying. But every aspect of bullying should be explored in order to understand not just the bully themselves, but the environment that creates them. 
Furthermore, Beaumont is an eye-opening story about a girl who made a mistake and has to deal with the aftermath of the wrongs she has committed.




                                      
                                        
In order to be successful, Beaumont will require funds to be used in multiple facets. 



Production Costs will cover items such as equipment rentals, professional crew, insurance, location usage contracts and more.


Promotions cover advertisements such as t-shirts, ad-space, fliers and more in order to spread Beaumont as far as it can reach.


Post Production funds will be used for music composition, licensing, film editing, color correction and more. 


Festival Circuit funds will allow the completed film to be entered in as many respected film festivals as possible. There, Beaumont will garner multiple Official Selections and awards, allowing it to reach the largest possible audience.


    All funds will be spent in the community of Shreveport, Louisiana - a fast-              growing and bustling art and film community in Northwest Louisiana!


Beaumont cannot be made without you! Whether or you donate $100 or even $1, every single bit helps. Your donation means a few things:

<h4>William Tyler Smith and Kurt Feldhun met at New York University and have known each other for over 20 years. Having recently collaborated on a documentary about Ray Manzarek of the Doors and Delta Blues slide-guitarist Roy Rogers, Smith and Feldhun decided to team up once again to tell the incredible story of the Flamin' Groovies, a band that they both knew from their youth. (Please see our full bios below for more information.)</h4>

<p><b><br/></b></p>
<h4>
<b>William Tyler Smith and Kurt Feldhun have been producing, directing, shooting and editing documentary and fiction films for over twenty-five years. Both have always successfully completed all of their films. To date, all three of Smith's feature films have been sold around the world. His fourth,<i>TheThird Mind Blues</i>, edited by Feldhun, about the musical collaboration between Doors keyboardist, Ray Manzarek and slide-guitarist, Roy Rogers, is nearing completion and already has distributor interest. Feldhun's television show, <i>Fishin' Impossible</i>, which he produced, directed and edited, is currently being broadcast on ESPN International.</b><br/>
</h4>
<h4>
<b><br/></b><b>Smith and Feldhun are the perfect music documentary partners and collaborators for this project, and many future projects to come.</b><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><br/></figure>

</div></div>","From award-winning filmmakers, William Tyler Smith and Kurt Feldhun, comes a feature length rock 'n' roll documentary about the Flamin' Groovies, a colorful and highly influential rock band that had some big hits in the 70's, but met with an untimely and difficult break up in the early 80's.  Although the Flamin' Groovies had all the makings for a successful career and famous fans like Rock Hudson, Eartha Kitt, Val Kilmer and The Rolling Stones, life seemed to conspire against them and they never quite made it. Since then, however, their songs Slow Death, Shake Some Action and Teenage Head, have been heard on motion picture soundtracks such as Clueless and numerous CD compilations. Shake Some Action is the first song featured in the new book, The History of Rock 'N' Roll in Ten Songs by legendary music journalist Greil Marcus and recently VH1 placed Shake Some Action on their 20 Essential Power Pop Tracks of All Time at #7. The Groovies have also been called the ""Godfathers of Punk Rock"" and many bands such as The Dictators, Cracker, The Plimsouls and Yo La Tengo have done Groovies' covers. According to Marianne Faithful, the Groovies' album, Teenage Head, was Mick Jagger and Keith Richard's favorite album at the time it came out in 1971. The Flamin' Groovies are ""the biggest band you've never heard of"" …until now.

Now 30 years later, they are embarking on a comeback tour and this time they are determined to get the notoriety that seemed to have eluded them. They're full of life, full of stories, and full of sh*t…
...and we're capturing it all on film.


THE FILM

Our film will take the viewer on a wild journey through the world of the Flamin' Groovies with a behind the scenes and backstage portrayal of their comeback, the new recording sessions and each band member's personal lives. We will capture all of their antics, stories, and general madness. We'll cover the ins and outs, the ups and the downs of life with the Flamin' Groovies. And of course, we'll cover the Groovies' colorful history leading up to their difficult break up.


Cyril, Chris and George are fascinating and intelligent characters. They are unpredictable and still think they are in their early twenties. Who knows what's bound to happen?

If you liked Anvil, Searching for Sugarman, and Spinal Tap you're gonna love this one even more!
WHAT WE'VE ACCOMPLISHED We have already begun the rough edit and in addition to the above IndieGoGo trailer, we have completed these following trailers:

William Tyler Smith and Kurt Feldhun met at New York University and have known each other for over 20 years. Having recently collaborated on a documentary about Ray Manzarek of the Doors and Delta Blues slide-guitarist Roy Rogers, Smith and Feldhun decided to team up once again to tell the incredible story of the Flamin' Groovies, a band that they both knew from their youth. (Please see our full bios below for more information.)




""I had one of their albums in high school and I really liked it. I was   thrilled to hear that they were making a comeback 30 years later."" Kurt Feldhun

GROOVIES HISTORYThe Flamin' Groovies story goes all the way back to 1965 when the band began in their hometown of San Francisco, California. Their first self-released 10-inch album called Sneakers sold well and caught the attention of Columbia Records, which signed them and released their first official album, Supersnazz on the Epic label.


 ""Bill Graham hated our name. He thought we were gay or something. He said, ‘you gotta change your name.' That’s like telling Van Gogh that color don’t work.” Cyril Jordan

The band had its first brush with success in 1971 with the song and album entitled Teenage Head, which is listed in the 2006 book, 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die. In 1972, Chris Wilson joined the band as lead singer and they released the song Slow Death. The gritty sound of this recording was infectious and the band was invited to play television shows around the world. Slow Death on live television: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EL3pP29N-Wc




The Groovies continued to tour hard and record an impressive number of albums during the 1970's. In 1976, they released their biggest hit to date, Shake Some Action. The song hit 142 on Billboard's top 200 and years later was featured in the film Clueless.
In July of 1976, the Ramones opened for the Groovies in London at the Roundhouse. This show is considered a galvanizing event for the UK punk scene. In 1981, after over a decade of hard work and dedication the band experienced a difficult and painful break up. 



""We were all, you know, basically just too stoned to continue. We needed to take a break. Everybody had cocaine-itis."" Cyril Jordan

""It seemed like life was thwarting us at every turn and after ten years of living out of each others suitcases we just couldn't take it anymore and we cracked."" Chris Wilson


The band went their separate ways and didn't speak over the next 30 years. George Alexander worked for the United States Postal Service for 25 years, Cyril Jordan started a band called Magic Christian and often held 3 jobs at once, and Chris Wilson joined the Barracudas and put out several solo albums. The clock was ticking, the years were passing when Cyril, Chris and George finally decided that it was time to let bygones be bygones and to continue exactly where they had left off that day in 1981 when they broke up.

""We were just so happy when we first saw each other. We just grabbed each other and gave each other a big hug and a kiss."" Chris Wilson

""I made a promise with Cyril...that we would see this out together to the end. Now that we’re back together again, it’s almost as if we get a second chance to fulfill that promise."" George Alexander


 ""I'm getting a little too old to be doing this rock 'n' roll thing."" Cyril Jordan



New drummer, Victor Penalosa, faithfully recreates the style heard on the classic recordings, while at the same time adding his own flavor. The foursome has gone into the studio to record brand new material as well as finish up some long lost recordings. They have begun playing shows again to enthusiastic fans both old and new. Fans have been delighted with what is being called ""a dream set list,"" including original songs the band has never performed before onstage.


""""This time around, it happened mostly because of the fans."" Cyril Jordan
I thought one day we might get the kudos and attention that we all had craved. I hope that’s what’s happening now.” Chris Wilson


""I hadn't played the bass for twenty-five years. I had no reason to play."" George Alexander

""Time and space don't affect us for some reason when we're together. It's like the day after we broke up in 1980."" Cyril Jordan


We are pleased and honored to have music veteran, Joel Jaffe, on board who will supervise the audio recording and mixing, and will engineer and produce The Groovies latest album at Studio D in Sausalito, California. 

Joel has worked with such artists as Ray Manzarek, Roy Rogers, Carlos Santana, Ringo Starr, John Entwhistle, Indigo Girls, Huey Lewis & The News, Todd Rundren and The Call to name a few. Joel was also the engineer/sound mixer for the cult classic films Light Sleeper and Wave Twisters.

#Il Consorzio (a 'Union of...' in Italian) is my story-telling-wine-selling-project, exposing small family owned wineries through stories I wrote about them and not explicitly through their wines; to some extent, a collection of my notes about the vibe around the winery, it's people, my experiences and conversations with them and of course its wines - all through my eyes. 
                                              What are we doing here?We're here to create short documentary videos about these wineries and expose these pearls to the world. 
So, If you ever saw something with raw potential which couldn't make it its own, you know what I'm talking about. Get on board to tell their stories even better and help the world discover these hidden jewels!

                                                Moshé Weizman basics- It's Moshé, with the é.- 37 years old, married, father of one, living in Israel, an only child, color blind, allergic to cats, long distance runner, die hard hockey fan, half French (Mom's side), lived 5 years in Canada, licensed mediator, working in High Tech for the past 15 years...- A descendant of 2 restaurateurs, practically grew up inside a Beef Bourgignon smothered by wine...

                                           What drove me to Il Consorzio?



From the personal side...2 things...


1. Mom&Dad always had wine around; drinking it, cooking with it, everything... Wine was constantly on the table, a simple, basic consumer good.

2. My weakness to family wineries; simple, modest people with tremendous pride in what they do, who they are, their families and their wines...; I visited so many family wineries through the years, and practically fell in love with each of them. Wouldn't you fall for these faces..?




Luisa, the adorable owner of Colline di Sopra (Tuscany)

3 generations of the San Lorenzo winery (Tuscany)



Tonio, La Contea's living legend (Piemonte)
Every time I would get back home, I just knew I wanted to do something with them. So I did ! :-)
From the professional  side...4 things
1. Family winery wines are simply very difficult to find on the web...
2. In general, online wine shops simply look like one big virtual supermarket! 
3. Information that tells you about who's behind the wines is simply missing! 
Won't knowing who and what's behind it, what's its story - make you more keen on buying it, telling people about it, showing it off?

4. In the evolving web and Social Media reality we live in, technical sheets and reviews won't cut it. People will want an experience, something to feel, to love and to appreciate. They need a story; hey, even Forbes says so... 





(see here: http://onforb.es/1eq4pqb)




                                   So, what makes Il Consorzio different?

- Il Consorzio is a voice for those who still can't or don't know how to speak the international language of the WEB or Social Networks.
- Il Consorzio exposes wines from excellent, high quality family wineries ONLY, making roughly 50K bottles per year. 
- Il Consorzio is about quality wines but at prices which are 20-30% cheaper than similar alternatives.
- Yes, Il Consorzio sells wines, but above all, it sells an experience, a passion, a story, a legacy.

                                          What has been achieved so far?
Quite a lot actually...
- A pilot running in The Netherlands for the past 6 months and doing quite good. 

- 12 wineries are already in my 'notebook' with their stories just waiting to be told.- 2 wineries have already had their stories actually told and wines sold, generating sales of several EU Ks.

So how does it look...? A bit like this... (Oh, yes, it's in Dutch... An English version is part of our next steps...) 








Why a pilot in The NL  you ask...? Good question...
- Size; not too big, not too small of a market.
- Wine consumption; ~24L/capita per year; 13th in the world! Not too bad Dutchies!- Heavy E-commerce habits.
- Logistic feasibility; The Dutch government is Royal in facilitating 'foreigners' like me with their business in NL.


                                      So, now what...? What's our next step?



- Il Consorzio needs to go to the next level in terms of the Multimedia and 'experience' aspects of its content; currently, I share my stories and my pictures of the wineries and their owners, but there's so much more that can be done to tell these wineries' stories...
I want the site be a mirror of the experience in these wineries and give them even more life with short documentary videos of each of them. 
I want to document those little moments you just wish you could take a picture of, or film: The morning walk with the winery owner; slipping into his wife's kitchen to see what's cooking for lunch; the magical aperitif time at the winery wine-bar, the chat with the girl at dinner...
                               Beyond this campaign, thinking 2 steps ahead... 
Success with this first step in The Netherlands will enable the addition of more wines, more stories, and most importantly - more wineries to the portfolio of Il Consorzio.
                                                 Thinking 3 steps ahead... 
- Expanding to other EU countries, Israel, US and Asia
                                           So what are we raising exactly?
I can't make all of the above happen without you joining me. I'm raising $28,000 in this campaign, which I will use to fund the following:
- Production of  videos exposing my  wineries along with a budget to promote them .
- A budget to make the necessary adjustments to www.il-consorzio.com to be able to carry such Multimedia and offer a better user interface.





                                      
                                         So, what can we give back to you?



          
            Il Consorzio - A One Stop Shop for family wineries around the world!
Il Consorzio is about getting people as close to family wineries as possible. 

- Il Consorzio's portofolio of family wineries will become vast and international.
- Il Consorzio will go offline with tasting event exposing the wines of my wineries in each of the countries it will operate in.
- Il Consorzio will be a Tourism stop to reach these wineries for getaways and dedicated tastings.
And, last push...
I've been working in High Tech for 15 years and specializing in starting up new operations, building or rebuilding relationships and partnerships and translating all of this into commercial success and constant over achievements. I know that if you join me, I can make Il Consorzio the one stop shop for family wineries worldwide. I just need your little push to start this. 
Join me in leading these wineries out of the shadows. If you can contribute - it would mean the world to me. If not - just share this video and my project around, and help me get the world closer to its family wineries.
Thank you! Yours, me",8.0,0,"1 Campaign
