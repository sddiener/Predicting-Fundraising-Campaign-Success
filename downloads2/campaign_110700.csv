<h3>Hello</h3>
<p>Hi guys, I'm Colm and I'm a fan of (mostly) everything big and small screen. I've always been interested in quizzes and started running them about 8 years ago. Now I'm starting a new adventure and combining my two passions.... quizzes and tv/movies<span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">. So now I'm writing pop culture quiz books. </span></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I need</h3>
<p>I'm trying to raise money to get the books into print. My intention is to do phases of book releases, with the first phase consisting of three books. The first book, Brooklyn Nine-Nine, is complete and ready for print / e-publishing and the second book, based on the TV shoe Frasier. Everyone who backs the campaign will get an ebook, a possible print if we can hit the target and I would like the third book's subject to be picked by a backer.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I've done lots of different things with my life, graphic design, bar owner, dj, photographer, quiz host - but no matter what i do every evening when i get home i love to sit down and watch some TV. Due to the COVID lockdowns in my country I have found myself with more free time and so I'd like to turn that time into something interesting and fun. With your backing i can hopefully provide you with some fun nights with friends doing a ZOOM quiz or maybe a challenge after that Netflix binge watch.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I don't know how this is going to go, this is my first time writing quiz books, it's my first time publishing anything and it's my first time crowdfunding. I would love to get these books into stores, as they not only have lots of interesting questions but I've also included my own artwork based on each subject. If it doesn't become a reality I'd like to still have them distributed online, so everyone can enjoy them.</p>
</div><p>And that's all there is to it. I hope you choose to back my project and new career :)<br/><br/>Thanks for reading</p></div>","Hello

<p><strong>Jerry Blank</strong>, artist, painter, designer, writer, want-to-be chef, tennis player, encourager to like souls.</p>
<p>With a degree in Industrial Design from San Jose State University, Jerry was the principal and creative director at his own graphic design firm in Palo Alto and San Jose, California for over thirty years. In 2000, he moved to Paris, France for a year to paint and make the transition from commercial design to fine art. Returning to the U.S.A. he moved to Las Vegas to advance his painting career. His paintings have been featured in galleries in New York, Miami, Nantucket, Houston, Monterey, San Jose, Laguna Beach and Las Vegas.</p>
<p>Along the way, he has taught design at Foothill College and San Jose State University. And opened a fine art gallery in Henderson, Nevada from 2002-2008. His work is collected in Europe, Canada, South America, Asia, as well as, the United States.</p>

<p>This <strong>Backroads of Southern Nevada</strong> campaign is the perfect tool to create the funds I need to publish and distribute the book. I’ve spent the last year and a half traveling and exploring the off-the-beaten-path spots around Southern Nevada, sketching and writing about these places and designing this book. I've asked John Burke, host of PBS's show <strong>Outdoor Nevada</strong> to write a foreword to the book and he's been gracious to acquiesce.  It’s been receiving tremendous response and I am very confident it will be a success in hotel and casino gift shops, book stores, travel and art groups and fill a missing hole of information about Southern Nevada.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Now I need your participation to publish and distribute the book. Your support will assist me with the needed funds to launch the book. Once the first edition gains momentum, the book sales will sustain itself. The initial printing of 3500 books in China will cost $12,500 and the advertising, promotion, and distribution is estimated around $2500. I plan to visit as many gift shops, book stores like Barnes &amp; Noble, Hudson Books at the airport, convention center, travel and civic groups around Southern Nevada to promote and distribute the book; as well as, give lectures, create book signings and go to meet-up groups around Southern Nevada.</p>
<p>Of course, it will be fantastic to gain your support and reach my goal and proceed with printing and distributing the book. However, if we fall short, I will print a smaller edition of the book and continue with the distribution and promotion campaign. This book is a winner and with your support, I'll gain the momentum needed for the book launch.</p>

</div><div><h3>Thank you for reading this all the way to the finish. And thank you for your support.  Jerry Blank</h3></div></div>","Jerry Blank, artist, painter, designer, writer, want-to-be chef, tennis player, encourager to like souls.
With a degree in Industrial Design from San Jose State University, Jerry was the principal and creative director at his own graphic design firm in Palo Alto and San Jose, California for over thirty years. In 2000, he moved to Paris, France for a year to paint and make the transition from commercial design to fine art. Returning to the U.S.A. he moved to Las Vegas to advance his painting career. His paintings have been featured in galleries in New York, Miami, Nantucket, Houston, Monterey, San Jose, Laguna Beach and Las Vegas.
Along the way, he has taught design at Foothill College and San Jose State University. And opened a fine art gallery in Henderson, Nevada from 2002-2008. His work is collected in Europe, Canada, South America, Asia, as well as, the United States.
 

This Backroads of Southern Nevada campaign is the perfect tool to create the funds I need to publish and distribute the book. I’ve spent the last year and a half traveling and exploring the off-the-beaten-path spots around Southern Nevada, sketching and writing about these places and designing this book. I've asked John Burke, host of PBS's show Outdoor Nevada to write a foreword to the book and he's been gracious to acquiesce.  It’s been receiving tremendous response and I am very confident it will be a success in hotel and casino gift shops, book stores, travel and art groups and fill a missing hole of information about Southern Nevada.
 
Now I need your participation to publish and distribute the book. Your support will assist me with the needed funds to launch the book. Once the first edition gains momentum, the book sales will sustain itself. The initial printing of 3500 books in China will cost $12,500 and the advertising, promotion, and distribution is estimated around $2500. I plan to visit as many gift shops, book stores like Barnes & Noble, Hudson Books at the airport, convention center, travel and civic groups around Southern Nevada to promote and distribute the book; as well as, give lectures, create book signings and go to meet-up groups around Southern Nevada.
Of course, it will be fantastic to gain your support and reach my goal and proceed with printing and distributing the book. However, if we fall short, I will print a smaller edition of the book and continue with the distribution and promotion campaign. This book is a winner and with your support, I'll gain the momentum needed for the book launch.
For your participation, there are some very nice rewards.

<h2><strong>Why This Odyssey Matters</strong></h2>

<p> </p>
<p>In each town I paddle up to, I’ve got to stash the canoe, dump the river water out of my Muck Boots, and with electronics bag and a notepad firmly in hand, pause to chronicle an “American” story like the ones below, documenting with video, still photography and the written word. <strong>By the end of the voyage, there will be more than 100 stories that span across the nation.</strong></p>

<h3><i>Story: ""A Legacy of Diversity: The Finns, Norwegians and Chinese of Astoria:""</i></h3>
<p><i>It is home to the first permanent U.S., non-native settlement west of the Rockies. Astoria, Oregon, you see, is big on diversity.</i></p>
<p><i>The Finns and Norwegians would arrive in their greatest numbers in the early 20th century. But back in the 1880s, had you taken a stroll down one of these storied riverside streets, one in three people you would have encountered would have been Chinese.</i></p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/276969875?portrait=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p><i>The town is a prime example of </i>e pluribus unum<i>, out of the many, one. There is a strength here where the word “immigration” is an affirmation. </i></p>
<p><i>“We have a heart for that,” explained Berit Madsen, 75, who immigrated to the U.S. from Drammen, Norway in 1963. “Because I see the positive.” </i></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong><i>Story: ""A Community Rallying Around the 'Other':""</i></strong></h3>
<p><i>The Hood River Valley has a history of ‘others’. The Finns of the late 19th century, the Japanese of the early to mid 20th century, and now those who identify as Hispanic and Latino. I recently spoke with a number of town leaders and bright light activists. Mainly women, both young and old, who are standing up in a unified voice of defiance. Here is a sampling of what they had to say:</i></p>

<p><i>Gracelia arrived in America from Mexico at the age of 14. She wanted to attend school as a child, but her father told her that they were here to work. Graciela has cleaned houses, worked in fruit packing houses, and has picked cherries, pears, and apples. For the past 33 years, she has petitioned the government for a green card, which she received this past year. But she says it doesn’t mean anything when others in the community have yet to receive theirs. “If we don’t say something we are going to keep living in the dark,” Graciela told me. “And it’s time to bring a little light.”</i></p>

<h3><strong><i>Story: “The Undercurrent of America:”</i></strong></h3>

<h2><strong>What’s Next?</strong></h2>
<p>For the second leg of the journey from up top the Continental Divide to New Orleans, Louisiana, these story themes, and many more, lie on the horizon:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Economic Divide</strong>: Together, we will discover and document bridges over a growing economic divide as seen through the eyes of homeless students, affluent neighborhoods, and the experimental schools that serve them.</li>
<li>
<strong>Environment</strong>: Neal will canoe through some of the most breathtaking scenic parks in America -- including the Upper Missouri River Breaks. Together, we'll trek a day in the life of the footsteps of a National Park ranger to discover how we can protect these wild lands, of how we can help.</li>
<li>
<strong>Immigration</strong>: Known as a melting pot the world over, we'll walk the walk with newly-arrived immigrants and the old alike. Asking the question - do you know the history underneath your feet, and was your family a part of that history?  </li>
<li>
<strong>Race Relations</strong>: From Ferguson, Missouri to the Mason-Dixie Line of Cairo, Illinois to further downstream along the Mississippi Delta, Neal will turn his camera on unsung heroes, game changers from multiple race backgrounds.</li>
<li>
<strong>Native American Narrative</strong>: On every river that Neal will ply, there is a First People that came along long before. Together, we will reach out and step onto tribal land to experience and learn the lessons of wisdom, history, and tradition. </li>
</ul>

There are twenty-four 4th graders who are 98% Hispanic, who think you are Superman. There is a little 4th grade girl that you caused to hear the ocean. She held a moon snail shell up to her ear for the first time and wanted to listen and understand what the sea sounded like, because this is from where you had come.""</i> -- Todd Kenning, Volunteer at Sacagawea State Park</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Help Out &amp; Get Some Awesome Rewards</strong></h2>
<p>This is a gigantic undertaking. And although I am paddling solo, I am not alone. It’s taken years of planning and a worldwide community of friends and collaborators to help set a unique transcontinental route, gear up, and light out. The good news is that with the up-current, uphill first leg of the expedition already funded and complete, it’s time to move forward to the next.</p>
<p>This is where YOU come in!  I need YOUR HELP to see this second 8-month, 3,249-mile leg of the journey through. So please donate if you feel so inspired and are able.</p>
<p>Reaching my Indiegogo goal of $8,600 for the second leg of the expedition helps cover day-to-day expenses all the way to New Orleans. It also helps replace recently lost gear. Following a bend in the river and a <a href=""https://alittlewake.wordpress.com/2018/06/18/a-bend-in-the-river/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">tumble into the St. Regis River</a> (a tributary of the Clark Fork in Montana), I was lucky to walk away from the logjam ""strainer"" with my life, but lost a few hundred pounds of gear in the process.</p>
<p>All funding will go directly to the project. And regardless of denomination, every single donor will have their name listed on the website Supporters page at the end of the campaign. As together, we discover and report on the soul of America!</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for your support!</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></h2>
<p>Additionally, there are a number of things you can do to help get the word out:</p>

<li>It matters a great deal – it means the world!</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Gratitude</strong></h2>
<p>I’m grateful for so many new friends and experiences, along with the Columbia, Spokane, Clark Fork and Continental Divide themselves. A series of rivers and terrain I’ve learned to respect, to fear, and ultimately embrace during the 120 days and 1,086 miles I’ve called them home.</p>
<p>Cheers to all of you for your steady stream of well wishes and encouragement and support. When I’d given it my all and I came up short, there was forever a slap on the back and a handshake and a ‘we’re thinking of you’ to embolden me on.</p>
<p>A mighty testing ground for the waterways of this nation to come, here on top of the Continental Divide, I’ll take a glance back to reflect on the West and aim my canoe onwards to the East -- forwards to eastern Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Iowa, Nebraska, Missouri, Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana.   </p>

Story: ""A Legacy of Diversity: The Finns, Norwegians and Chinese of Astoria:""
It is home to the first permanent U.S., non-native settlement west of the Rockies. Astoria, Oregon, you see, is big on diversity.
The Finns and Norwegians would arrive in their greatest numbers in the early 20th century. But back in the 1880s, had you taken a stroll down one of these storied riverside streets, one in three people you would have encountered would have been Chinese.

The town is a prime example of e pluribus unum, out of the many, one. There is a strength here where the word “immigration” is an affirmation. 
“We have a heart for that,” explained Berit Madsen, 75, who immigrated to the U.S. from Drammen, Norway in 1963. “Because I see the positive.” 
 
Story: ""A Community Rallying Around the 'Other':""
The Hood River Valley has a history of ‘others’. The Finns of the late 19th century, the Japanese of the early to mid 20th century, and now those who identify as Hispanic and Latino. I recently spoke with a number of town leaders and bright light activists. Mainly women, both young and old, who are standing up in a unified voice of defiance. Here is a sampling of what they had to say:

Gracelia arrived in America from Mexico at the age of 14. She wanted to attend school as a child, but her father told her that they were here to work. Graciela has cleaned houses, worked in fruit packing houses, and has picked cherries, pears, and apples. For the past 33 years, she has petitioned the government for a green card, which she received this past year. But she says it doesn’t mean anything when others in the community have yet to receive theirs. “If we don’t say something we are going to keep living in the dark,” Graciela told me. “And it’s time to bring a little light.”
 
Story: “The Undercurrent of America:”
For 15,000 years, Celilo was a gathering place for the Native American people, the oldest continuously inhabited community on the North American continent, and a mecca for traders who came for the salmon from far and wide.

“I remember the sound of that river and of those falls,” Wilbur Slockish, Jr. told me. Slockish, who was raised on these waters, is the chief of the Klickitat people, a Native American tribe of the Pacific Northwest. 
“I used to make money by packing one or two fish – the fish were bigger in those days. And I packed them up for the fishermen so that they could fish and I would struggle up there. And that’s where I got my strength, for that was my exercise.”

What’s Next?
For the second leg of the journey from up top the Continental Divide to New Orleans, Louisiana, these story themes, and many more, lie on the horizon:


Economic Divide: Together, we will discover and document bridges over a growing economic divide as seen through the eyes of homeless students, affluent neighborhoods, and the experimental schools that serve them.

Immigration: Known as a melting pot the world over, we'll walk the walk with newly-arrived immigrants and the old alike. Asking the question - do you know the history underneath your feet, and was your family a part of that history?  

Race Relations: From Ferguson, Missouri to the Mason-Dixie Line of Cairo, Illinois to further downstream along the Mississippi Delta, Neal will turn his camera on unsung heroes, game changers from multiple race backgrounds.

Native American Narrative: On every river that Neal will ply, there is a First People that came along long before. Together, we will reach out and step onto tribal land to experience and learn the lessons of wisdom, history, and tradition. 

 
""Your ripple effects are not only on the water, they are through the sounds and sagebrush of this desert, and into the front doors of Emerson Elementary. There are twenty-four 4th graders who are 98% Hispanic, who think you are Superman. There is a little 4th grade girl that you caused to hear the ocean. She held a moon snail shell up to her ear for the first time and wanted to listen and understand what the sea sounded like, because this is from where you had come."" -- Todd Kenning, Volunteer at Sacagawea State Park
 
Help Out & Get Some Awesome Rewards
This is a gigantic undertaking. And although I am paddling solo, I am not alone. It’s taken years of planning and a worldwide community of friends and collaborators to help set a unique transcontinental route, gear up, and light out. The good news is that with the up-current, uphill first leg of the expedition already funded and complete, it’s time to move forward to the next.
This is where YOU come in!  I need YOUR HELP to see this second 8-month, 3,249-mile leg of the journey through. So please donate if you feel so inspired and are able.
Reaching my Indiegogo goal of $8,600 for the second leg of the expedition helps cover day-to-day expenses all the way to New Orleans. It also helps replace recently lost gear. Following a bend in the river and a tumble into the St. Regis River (a tributary of the Clark Fork in Montana), I was lucky to walk away from the logjam ""strainer"" with my life, but lost a few hundred pounds of gear in the process.
All funding will go directly to the project. And regardless of denomination, every single donor will have their name listed on the website Supporters page at the end of the campaign. As together, we discover and report on the soul of America!
Thank you in advance for your support!

Gratitude
I’m grateful for so many new friends and experiences, along with the Columbia, Spokane, Clark Fork and Continental Divide themselves. A series of rivers and terrain I’ve learned to respect, to fear, and ultimately embrace during the 120 days and 1,086 miles I’ve called them home.
Cheers to all of you for your steady stream of well wishes and encouragement and support. When I’d given it my all and I came up short, there was forever a slap on the back and a handshake and a ‘we’re thinking of you’ to embolden me on.
A mighty testing ground for the waterways of this nation to come, here on top of the Continental Divide, I’ll take a glance back to reflect on the West and aim my canoe onwards to the East -- forwards to eastern Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Iowa, Nebraska, Missouri, Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana.   
Enormous thanks to the following news and media agencies that have covered my expeditions:

 
And a HUGE CHEERS to you for your support!
 
Neal

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>     “Daddy, tell us a story”</p>
<p>     “OK, what do you want to hear?”</p>
<p>     “Sleeping Beauty!”</p>
<p>     “Little Red Riding Hood!”</p>
<p>     “Cinderella!”</p>
<p>     “Snow White!”</p>
<p>     “Goldilocks!”</p>
<p>     “Jack and the Beanstalk!”</p>
<p>     “The Three Little Pigs!”</p>
<p>     “Rumpelstiltskin!”</p>
<p>     “Alright, I know that one…”</p>
<p>​In 1997, as the father of 4 young children, I had been reading to my children for years and decided to try my hand at storytelling.  I thought it would be fun to combine several popular children’s stories into a single narrative which would be entertaining for both children and adults.  The result is, “A Fairy Tales”, or “Sleeping Little Cindersnowylocks and Jack and the Three Pigs meet Rumpelstiltskin”.  A short but fun-filled story with Ugly Stepsisters, a Sorceress, Jack’s prizes from the giant, and Three Little Pigs living in a house with a very strange construction.  See if you can identify each different source Fairy Tale as you go through this hilarious story.</p>
<p>Now, 22 years later, after much prodding from these children who are no longer so young, I hope to share this story outside my family.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I expect the illustrations and printing for this project to cost between $5000 and $7500. </p>
<p>Anyone who donates $50 or more will receive a signed copy of the book.</p>
<p>Anyone who donates $100 or more will receive one of their choice of pages signed by the illustrator.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I believe this is a fun story which will be enjoyed by adults and children alike.  In today's world, it is nice to be able to have a little fun, be nostalgic, and also be just a little irreverent about some of the Fairy Tales which have been so well known in our culture.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>This is my first attempt at any type of publishing.  I am learning but believe this is an excellent project which has a lot of potential.  I look forward to seeing and sharing the finished product.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't donate, please feel free to share this project.  Let others know that they have an opportunity to be one of the first to own what is sure to be a classic storybook.</p>

     “Cinderella!”
     “Snow White!”
     “Goldilocks!”
     “Jack and the Beanstalk!”
     “The Three Little Pigs!”
     “Rumpelstiltskin!”
     “Alright, I know that one…”
​In 1997, as the father of 4 young children, I had been reading to my children for years and decided to try my hand at storytelling.  I thought it would be fun to combine several popular children’s stories into a single narrative which would be entertaining for both children and adults.  The result is, “A Fairy Tales”, or “Sleeping Little Cindersnowylocks and Jack and the Three Pigs meet Rumpelstiltskin”.  A short but fun-filled story with Ugly Stepsisters, a Sorceress, Jack’s prizes from the giant, and Three Little Pigs living in a house with a very strange construction.  See if you can identify each different source Fairy Tale as you go through this hilarious story.
Now, 22 years later, after much prodding from these children who are no longer so young, I hope to share this story outside my family.

What We Need & What You Get
I expect the illustrations and printing for this project to cost between $5000 and $7500. 
Anyone who donates $50 or more will receive a signed copy of the book.
Anyone who donates $100 or more will receive one of their choice of pages signed by the illustrator.

The Impact
I believe this is a fun story which will be enjoyed by adults and children alike.  In today's world, it is nice to be able to have a little fun, be nostalgic, and also be just a little irreverent about some of the Fairy Tales which have been so well known in our culture.

Risks & Challenges
This is my first attempt at any type of publishing.  I am learning but believe this is an excellent project which has a lot of potential.  I look forward to seeing and sharing the finished product.

Other Ways You Can Help
If you can't donate, please feel free to share this project.  Let others know that they have an opportunity to be one of the first to own what is sure to be a classic storybook.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>The Old Familiar Places</strong>  is the story of a passage of time between the two funerals of Ruby and Freddie, 44 years apart.   This is not a whimsical love story though it is tender.

<p>Underdog Revolution is advocacy for underdogs and underserved communities around the world. It’s also a call for large aid organizations and decision-makers to redefine innovation and social change. It argues for a world where underdogs and underserved communities are not seen as a burden, rather an untapped opportunity. In writing this book, I aim to invite the world to see us (the poor), the (undeserved) as co-creators, co-researchers, co-leaders, and not as data providers nor as a laboratory only for scientific study on poverty. Underdog Revolution is filled with examples and stories of local innovators who are moving the human race forward in the dark. My book will publish in April of 2020, just before my 31st birthday, so as it’s in my ""bucket list"", I will be a Published published Author at 30. :-)</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1581099844/svonjwid3hchq0jkrrjg.png"" src=""""/>This is just a Mockup, you will help me choose my real book cover</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<p><br/>Underdog Revolution is a new lens through which we can see poverty, innovation, and social change if we want to empower the 3.5 billion people living at the bottom of the pyramid.</p>
<p>My name is Pierre Stanley Baptiste and I am the author of ""<strong>Underdog Revolution</strong>"".</p>
<p>I hope in reading this book, you will discover how to empower underdogs in your immediate circle and unleash innovation at the bottom of the pyramid. Much like in the story of David and Goliath. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for the non-obvious winners (the David's of the world who can beat Goliath ) in you. And then ultimately I want you to see this book as a tool to help you recognize your underdogs' bias, do better charity work, a guide to discover tools and ways to enact social change that put the human at the center of the change you want to make, and overall how to apply underdog revolution in schools, churches, entrepreneurship and in your own life.</p>
<p>In this book, you'll learn about the link between creativity and scarcity, the reason why the top-down approach to innovation is wrong and discover how and why we need a new type of innovation if we want the 3.5 billion people living at the base of the pyramid (BOP) to thrive.</p>
<p>Did you know there are specific circumstances in which we support underdogs and most of them have little to do with the underdogs? Through the underdog revolution, you will learn the psychological reasons, bias, and fallacies that push us to support the underdog.</p>
<p>Based on my experiences working with underdogs and underserved communities in Haiti for the past 9 years, I offer you some practical ideas on how to even the playing field to allow underserved communities to thrive. Did you know Haiti doesn’t have access to Paypal and Stripe?</p>
<p>You will learn about the story of a man who spends two decades of his life cutting a path through a mountain. Stories of amazing leaders/changemakers such as Guerrier Hovard, Louino Robillard, Daniel Tilias, Katherine Hoke, Daquan Olivier, Nzingah Oniwosan and many more will inspire you and teach you about willpower, effort, the value of mentoring, giving back and the power of seeing what others cannot see.</p>
<p>You will love this book if you are interested in transforming lives at the bottom of the pyramid, if you want to see underserved communities and underdogs in a new light and if you actively looking for new ways to engage the people you seek to serve.</p>
<p>Underdog Revolution is a non-fiction book that speaks to international aid agencies’ experts, community leaders and any individuals who are interested in poverty alleviation, social change, innovation and who want to empower those who are seemed at a disadvantage.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Book - Underdog Innovation</h3>
<p>This book follows the three-act structure as in the War Of Art of Steven Pressfield. Each part brings you on this different adventure while staying consistent with the general theme.</p>
<p><strong>Part 1</strong><br/>How does the first black nation in the world become the poorest country in the western hemisphere? Section 1 starts with a story dear to my heart and that most convey the revolution carried by underdogs.</p>
<p>I also map out the advantages and challenges of the bottom of the pyramid, tackle the limitations of the top-down innovation approach and the value of creative constraints using scientific evidence and my personal story on how I manage to open Impact Hub Port-au-Prince with only 20% of the budget, without employees and with all the challenges that came with it. You will also learn about some new concepts such as ""toolbox fallacy: and the ""savior complex"".</p>
<p><strong>Part 2</strong><br/>How what was once a gang-infested neighborhood is creating change for a whole country and region? Part two dives into this great social change started at a community level and is carried by underdogs. You will also learn about some new ways to drive innovation, do research and create companies take the human element into account. You will learn about the power of second chance through an organization that’s empowering ex-criminals to become an entrepreneur and how some of them are thriving. I share personal ideas on how to turn ghettos into innovation lab and different types of labs we could set up in underserved communities to bring forth local innovation. The underdog advantage, the 7 strengths of an underdog.</p>
<p><br/><strong>Part 3</strong><br/>In part 3 I talk about the path forward and how we can build a better world through the bottom-up innovation approach. The steps (based on my experiences and research) to unleash innovation at the bottom of the pyramid and to replicate stories of creative-problem-solving, like the boy who harnessed the wind whom I met in 2014. You learn about scientific evidence about the correlation between GDP growth and inequality. You will also learn how the balance of these 3 elements environment, resource and pressure can make or break an underdog. Sprinkled with more than a dozen inspiring stories of individuals and organizations, part 3 paints the way forward on how to replicate underdog revolution in different types of organizations and how I envision a future when underserved communities and underdogs are empowered to solve their problems and to inspire more people to create change.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>More about me</h3>
<p>It all started on the Sunday of June 7, 1998, when I read a passage of the bible for my first communion day celebration. They had to put two bricks under my feet so people could see my face reading. This moment became a determining factor in my life. I was 8 years old.</p>
<p>After I finished reading, something strange happened; the church gave me a standing ovation. At that very moment, something in me was born and I knew I had a special gift to share with the world. Since that Sunday, I never stopped on my quest to become a better human being and to improve my surroundings.</p>
<p>This passion for bettering myself and people around me led to teaching, creative writing, blogging, podcasting, social entrepreneurship, personal development, philosophy, technology, event designing, and youth empowerment.</p>
<p>In 2014 I launched my personal blog pierrestanleybaptiste.com to share 20% of information that can have the highest impact on someone’s life. My contents were in English, but In 2016 I felt the urge to communicate with my community. So, I started writing in Haitian Creole for the very first time. People who speak creole in a professional setting are seen as non-educated while it’s the language of the majority. As of today, I have published over 100 blog posts on productivity, cognitive biases, learning techniques, branding, tech and other topics around professional development. My blog has become a reference and learning platform for dozens of young Haitians looking to better themselves.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My love for writing led me to write for the HuffingtonPost (English is my 3rd language), Pursuit and self-published my books. In December 2016, I published REVEY (ebook) to help people wake the genie up and discover the work they were born to do. In 2017, my second ebook KALIFYE came out. Kalifye introduces young people to 107 free digital tools they can use to create, learn and find a better for their smartphones and computers. This book is a direct response to the telecommunication companies in Haiti promoting the internet as a tool for social media use only. In this book, I opened readers' eyes to the endless possibilities the internet offers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I desperately want to leave a legacy of helping the weakest ones thrive whether it means raising money to help 200 farmers after Hurricane Matthew, providing school supplies to over 2000 students as well as developing an entrepreneurship education program for disadvantaged high school students.</p>
<p>In 2016 after a hard break up and a depression, I purchased a one-way ticket to go to the USA and to never come back to Haiti. Little did I know, this trip would lead to the biggest project I have undertaken in my entire life. After spending 3 months in the US, I decided to come back to launch Impact Hub Port-au-Prince, the first local hub and co-working space in Haiti with a global imprint.</p>
<p>As part of our programs, we recently hosted the 4th edition of StartupWeek, the largest and most inclusive entrepreneurial event in Port-au-Prince, welcoming more than 1500 attendees, 65 speakers, and 50 volunteers. Our space has become a community where coders, leaders, creators, designers meet, network and create amazing ventures with the aim to make a social impact.</p>
<p>Now, I am working on the first Haitian Creole media platform for entrepreneurs, a co-creating space to creative professionals, and this book which has been in my mind for 7 years. My larger vision can be summarized in three simple words “Empowering Non-obvious Winners”. I hope to be able to live to that aspiration. </p>

</div></div>","Underdog Revolution is advocacy for underdogs and underserved communities around the world. It’s also a call for large aid organizations and decision-makers to redefine innovation and social change. It argues for a world where underdogs and underserved communities are not seen as a burden, rather an untapped opportunity. In writing this book, I aim to invite the world to see us (the poor), the (undeserved) as co-creators, co-researchers, co-leaders, and not as data providers nor as a laboratory only for scientific study on poverty. Underdog Revolution is filled with examples and stories of local innovators who are moving the human race forward in the dark. My book will publish in April of 2020, just before my 31st birthday, so as it’s in my ""bucket list"", I will be a Published published Author at 30. :-)
This is just a Mockup, you will help me choose my real book cover
 
Story of My Book
Underdog Revolution is a new lens through which we can see poverty, innovation, and social change if we want to empower the 3.5 billion people living at the bottom of the pyramid.
My name is Pierre Stanley Baptiste and I am the author of ""Underdog Revolution"".
I hope in reading this book, you will discover how to empower underdogs in your immediate circle and unleash innovation at the bottom of the pyramid. Much like in the story of David and Goliath. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for the non-obvious winners (the David's of the world who can beat Goliath ) in you. And then ultimately I want you to see this book as a tool to help you recognize your underdogs' bias, do better charity work, a guide to discover tools and ways to enact social change that put the human at the center of the change you want to make, and overall how to apply underdog revolution in schools, churches, entrepreneurship and in your own life.
In this book, you'll learn about the link between creativity and scarcity, the reason why the top-down approach to innovation is wrong and discover how and why we need a new type of innovation if we want the 3.5 billion people living at the base of the pyramid (BOP) to thrive.
Did you know there are specific circumstances in which we support underdogs and most of them have little to do with the underdogs? Through the underdog revolution, you will learn the psychological reasons, bias, and fallacies that push us to support the underdog.
Based on my experiences working with underdogs and underserved communities in Haiti for the past 9 years, I offer you some practical ideas on how to even the playing field to allow underserved communities to thrive. Did you know Haiti doesn’t have access to Paypal and Stripe?
You will learn about the story of a man who spends two decades of his life cutting a path through a mountain. Stories of amazing leaders/changemakers such as Guerrier Hovard, Louino Robillard, Daniel Tilias, Katherine Hoke, Daquan Olivier, Nzingah Oniwosan and many more will inspire you and teach you about willpower, effort, the value of mentoring, giving back and the power of seeing what others cannot see.
You will love this book if you are interested in transforming lives at the bottom of the pyramid, if you want to see underserved communities and underdogs in a new light and if you actively looking for new ways to engage the people you seek to serve.
Underdog Revolution is a non-fiction book that speaks to international aid agencies’ experts, community leaders and any individuals who are interested in poverty alleviation, social change, innovation and who want to empower those who are seemed at a disadvantage.
 
The Book - Underdog Innovation
This book follows the three-act structure as in the War Of Art of Steven Pressfield. Each part brings you on this different adventure while staying consistent with the general theme.
Part 1How does the first black nation in the world become the poorest country in the western hemisphere? Section 1 starts with a story dear to my heart and that most convey the revolution carried by underdogs.
I also map out the advantages and challenges of the bottom of the pyramid, tackle the limitations of the top-down innovation approach and the value of creative constraints using scientific evidence and my personal story on how I manage to open Impact Hub Port-au-Prince with only 20% of the budget, without employees and with all the challenges that came with it. You will also learn about some new concepts such as ""toolbox fallacy: and the ""savior complex"".
Part 2How what was once a gang-infested neighborhood is creating change for a whole country and region? Part two dives into this great social change started at a community level and is carried by underdogs. You will also learn about some new ways to drive innovation, do research and create companies take the human element into account. You will learn about the power of second chance through an organization that’s empowering ex-criminals to become an entrepreneur and how some of them are thriving. I share personal ideas on how to turn ghettos into innovation lab and different types of labs we could set up in underserved communities to bring forth local innovation. The underdog advantage, the 7 strengths of an underdog.
Part 3In part 3 I talk about the path forward and how we can build a better world through the bottom-up innovation approach. The steps (based on my experiences and research) to unleash innovation at the bottom of the pyramid and to replicate stories of creative-problem-solving, like the boy who harnessed the wind whom I met in 2014. You learn about scientific evidence about the correlation between GDP growth and inequality. You will also learn how the balance of these 3 elements environment, resource and pressure can make or break an underdog. Sprinkled with more than a dozen inspiring stories of individuals and organizations, part 3 paints the way forward on how to replicate underdog revolution in different types of organizations and how I envision a future when underserved communities and underdogs are empowered to solve their problems and to inspire more people to create change.

More about me
It all started on the Sunday of June 7, 1998, when I read a passage of the bible for my first communion day celebration. They had to put two bricks under my feet so people could see my face reading. This moment became a determining factor in my life. I was 8 years old.
After I finished reading, something strange happened; the church gave me a standing ovation. At that very moment, something in me was born and I knew I had a special gift to share with the world. Since that Sunday, I never stopped on my quest to become a better human being and to improve my surroundings.
This passion for bettering myself and people around me led to teaching, creative writing, blogging, podcasting, social entrepreneurship, personal development, philosophy, technology, event designing, and youth empowerment.
In 2014 I launched my personal blog pierrestanleybaptiste.com to share 20% of information that can have the highest impact on someone’s life. My contents were in English, but In 2016 I felt the urge to communicate with my community. So, I started writing in Haitian Creole for the very first time. People who speak creole in a professional setting are seen as non-educated while it’s the language of the majority. As of today, I have published over 100 blog posts on productivity, cognitive biases, learning techniques, branding, tech and other topics around professional development. My blog has become a reference and learning platform for dozens of young Haitians looking to better themselves.
 
My love for writing led me to write for the HuffingtonPost (English is my 3rd language), Pursuit and self-published my books.

This book is a direct response to the telecommunication companies in Haiti promoting the internet as a tool for social media use only.

I desperately want to leave a legacy of helping the weakest ones thrive whether it means raising money to help 200 farmers after Hurricane Matthew, providing school supplies to over 2000 students as well as developing an entrepreneurship education program for disadvantaged high school students.
In 2016 after a hard break up and a depression, I purchased a one-way ticket to go to the USA and to never come back to Haiti. Little did I know, this trip would lead to the biggest project I have undertaken in my entire life. After spending 3 months in the US, I decided to come back to launch Impact Hub Port-au-Prince, the first local hub and co-working space in Haiti with a global imprint.

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The time is right for this book. Young students need exposure to a diverse array of voices and perspectives to understand the communities within which they live, and to develop their own unique identities. </p>
<p>With the recent passing of new social studies standards, Kentucky teachers will be required to integrate Kentucky studies into their curriculum.

<p>In both national and state history, women’s contributions are often overlooked. Likewise, women’s voices within the historical record are often lacking in breadth, depth, and diversity.

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p><strong>Representation:</strong>  Of utmost importance to the authors was to present a wide range of voices, being careful to appropriately and respectfully represent the profiled individuals.

<h3>Background</h3>
<p>My name is Obie Williams and I am an author. However, while writing is my greatest passion, it is also something I can only indulge in during limited free time. My first novel, <u>The Crimes of Orphans</u>, took nearly ten years to complete and self-publish, largely due to the fact that I could only work on it between work, college, and starting a family. Its sequel, <u>The Undoing of Tomorrow</u>, is currently at 65% first-draft completion, but still requires at least 200 hours of work to bring it close to a publish-ready state.</p>
<h3>A Rare Opportunity</h3>
<p>As many who know me personally are aware, I spent the latter part of 2019 and the early part of 2020 seeking a new full-time career path. Fortunately, great news came my way in the first week of February: I was offered (and have accepted) what could be a perfect new job for me! But there's a catch...the job doesn't start until April 1st (no foolin').</p>
<p>So, faced with the prospect of scrounging for piecemeal gig work while awaiting my new career to begin, I had a wonderful (and/or insane) idea. <strong>What if I could write full-time during that six-week waiting period?</strong> For the first time in my life, I could experience a brief taste of something I've always dreamed of doing: working on a novel 40 hours per week. However, this will require some funding, and that's...</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Where You Come In</h3>
<p>After crunching some budget numbers, I have figured out that I could squeak by writing full-time on an income of just $250 per week. This would supplement my family's income enough to keep our bills paid and food in our fridge while I embark on this daring journey. If I work 40 hours per week on the book, this comes to only $6.25/hour, but it is more than anything I have ever made in advance for writing before. What it is really buying is peace of mind. The knowledge that I can throw myself into my writing completely without having to worry about finding and engaging in side jobs while waiting for my new career to begin.</p>
<h3>The Rewards</h3>
<p>As you can see from the perks tiers, contribution is not without its benefits. The first few tiers are structured intentionally to act as pre-purchasing of the book at its intended sale prices, so you are effectively giving me an advance on what you would pay upon the book's release. The $5 tier earns you a copy of the ebook, whereas the $15 tier nabs you a paperback copy <i>and</i> the ebook, which saves you a bit of coin compared to buying the two separately after release.<br/><br/>From there, the rewards only get better, up to and including an opportunity to participate in early reading and reviews, a chance at having a character named after you or a loved one, and even a gift of limited-run hardcover editions of <u>The Undoing of Tomorrow</u> and/or <u>The Crimes of Orphans</u>!</p>
<h3>My Promise</h3>
<p>I would never dream of accepting your money for this endeavor without some guarantee that you will receive the perk(s) I am offering. To show that I take that matter seriously, I am setting myself a hard publication deadline of <strong>February 1st, 2021</strong>. My ultimate goal is to publish the book before the end of 2020, but I also recognize that life sometimes throws unexpected curveballs. Regardless, if for some unforeseeable reason I am unable to publish this novel by February 1st, 2021, all donors will be offered a <strong>full refund</strong>. I will do everything in my power to make sure this will not even come close to being a necessity, but I want the guarantee to be there nonetheless. It keeps me accountable and (hopefully) gives you greater confidence about investing in my work.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I know that not everyone can contribute financially. Anything you can offer is greatly appreciated, but even if it's not monetary in nature, you can still be helpful by sharing this campaign with others. Exposure is a big deal, and quite helpful in its own right.</p>
<p>Thank you, every single one of you, for your love and support of my creative endeavors. Sharing my stories is my greatest dream, but it would be nothing without folks like you with whom to share them.<br/><br/>So once again, thank you.<br/><i>Obie Williams</i></p>

<p><i>Tasked with developing mind control technology, a cybersecurity programmer turns rogue to save Mankind from a telepathic manipulative boy.</i></p>
<p><strong>Reality today is quickly catching up to Science Fiction</strong></p>
<p>ENTANGLEMENT is a story about mind control and freedom in the context of our choices. I need your help to publish it now as a graphic novel to reach the younger audience. I feel that we're running out of time – reality, it seems, is quickly catching up to the ""dystopian future"" setting of the script’s story. Microchip implants, mind control, the fight for our survival (you’ll find the synopsis at the bottom of the page) – all of this looms if we fail to see the bigger picture and to make some difficult choices in our lives.</p>
<p>The choices that we make – intentionally or automatically – and the impact they have on our lives are the reason why ENTANGLEMENT is so relevant today. I want to engage young people and to inspire them to make their choices consciously. To accomplish this, I feel that I need to make ENTANGLEMENT available as soon as possible, published as a graphic novel. With this campaign I’m raising funds to pay an artist/illustrator to create the visuals for this book (to give life to the script). I want you to help me positively influence the young generation, and to establish conscious storytelling as a movement, as a viable and effective way to inspire and empower people.</p>
<p><strong>It takes one person to change the world. That person is You.</strong></p>
<p>It will take approximately 9 months and $9 000 for the graphic artist to create roughly 450 illustrations that will complete this feature-length graphic novel. I’ve put together several contribution levels, which contain various ways to express my gratitude for your support. But perhaps the biggest perk you get for your contribution is knowing that you’re ushering in a better world by supporting the production of this freedom-affirming story.</p>
<p>With everything going on in the world right now, I feel that the stakes are too high to wait any longer. Even if I will not reach my goal of crowdsourcing $9 000, I will still do everything in my power to complete and publish ENTANGLEMENT. I really believe that this story can catalyze the next step in our evolution.</p>
<p><strong>What if you cannot donate?</strong></p>
<p>You can still help! If you resonate with my goal to inspire young people and to create a positive impact, please help me spread the word by sharing this campaign with your tribe. You will find various ways to share in the right sidebar of this page.</p>

<p><strong>ENTANGLEMENT synopsis (a couple spoilers)</strong></p>
<p>In a docile and fearful Boston in 2051 cars and bikes fly – and continue to pollute the environment. S.G.O.A. [Security of Government Organizations Agency] – the one-world-government organization, which enforces mandatory ID microchip implants on the entire human population, allegedly to keep people safe – drenches the whole world in fear to maintain its control.</p>
<p>After not having seen each other for 4 years, Nick – a successful cybersecurity specialist – meets his college friend Kate at the funeral of their professor. Kate reveals to Nick that their professor, who invented a quantum processor, was murdered for refusing to cooperate with S.G.O.A. With the help of a stolen prototype, Kate shows Nick that this technology is already in use – everyone’s thoughts are being monitored via their ID microchip implants. When Nick and Kate delve into the code to see if they can put a stop to this, they discover programmatic attempts to technologically control people’s minds as well. S.G.O.A. detects Nick and Kate tinkering with their ID implants and show up at their doorstep, forcing the protagonists to flee from the agency, digitally covering their tracks.</p>
<p>Their further delve into government secrets yields an entire world of hidden and suppressed technology – ways to control gravity, and to extract energy from the fabric of spacetime itself. Nick and Kate discover that this technology can potentially clean up the environment and turn the skies blue again…</p>
<p>S.G.O.A. director Carnegie reveals that he is after the same thing as the protagonists – he, too, wants to save the Earth. His intentions, however, are very different: to achieve his goal he prepares to drastically depopulate the planet, and he needs Nick to write the mind control program to accomplish this.</p>
<p>But Carnegie is only a figure in someone else’s game of chess. The originator of the plan to kill 90% of the Earth’s population is Kyle – a 7-year-old telepathic boy with a vendetta against the world. Kyle and his twin sister Eve, who is also telepathic, were physically abused by their stepfather. When the twins went to school, their peers almost killed them for having psychic powers. Before they ran away from home, Kyle and Eve both swore to change the world: Kyle made the choice to take revenge on the world, while Eve swore to love and protect it.</p>
<p>In a race against time, Eve helps the protagonists to fight back against Kyle and his puppet S.G.O.A. It becomes up to Nick, Kate and Eiichiro to make the difficult, life-threatening decisions and fight against an entire army that’s out to destroy them.</p>

<p>I was asked relatively early on in my path of providing translations for and writing books on Japanese swords to produce something on <i>gendaitô</i>. I then always promised to do so but kept postponing such a project, on the one hand because I was so occupied with providing information on older swords, i.e. <i>kotô</i>, <i>shintô</i>, and <i>shinshintô</i>, and on the other hand because I did not yet have an idea about how to tackle this topic in the first place. Several relevant books had been published that deal with the post-Meiji sword world and the most important smiths of that era so I didn’t want to ruminate and write the same thing just with other words. Listening to inquiries I get on a regular basis on <i>gendaitô </i>however, it emerged that what was mostly needed was information on these smiths and references of their work. Thus I decided that when I am tackling the topic <i>gendaitô</i>, it should be more a database with CV’s of swordsmiths etc. rather than a history book.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In this sense, I started to collect <i>gendaitô-</i>related data and announced on several platforms, e.g. my website and the Nihonto Message Board, that I was looking for relevant references. This was in summer of 2014. Planned was a book that introduces in an alphabetical order as many as possible <i>gendaitô</i> smiths but then throughout 2015 and up to early 2016, I had received so much data that I started to think of a two-pronged approach. In other words, there is no way to fit all these gigabytes into a single physical book and I also didn’t want to have important references rot on my HD. Thus a comprehensive online database suggested itself which is easy to extend and which also allows corrections and amendments whenever new data comes in.</p>
<p>Long story short, there will be a book (and an eBook) that lists all the <i>gendaitô</i> smiths I have in my records so far and what is known on each of them (as mentioned, as comprehensive as possible). There will be references in the form of <i>oshigata</i> and blade pictures and also portrait photos of some of the smiths will be provided. Parallel to that, I want to create the mentioned online database which should look something like seen in this link (<a href=""https://gendaitoproject.wordpress.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://gendaitoproject.wordpress.com/</a>). For doing so, I need funds to cover the time necessary to feed the database over the coming months and to maintain it in the years to come. I thought that the database should be free and accessible for everyone who is looking for relevant information and that is why I decided to tackle this is a one-time crowdfunding instead of a pay to play or an individual subcription approach. And this is why I need your help to create the most comprehensive database on <i>gendaitô</i> smiths and to preserve information on them for future generations!</p>

<p>My name is Ted Oswald, and I’m a lawyer, author, and new father to a little boy (yikes!). Back in 2012, I successfully crowdfunded the release of a ‘nonprofit novel’ called <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Because-Are-Lib%C3%A8te-Limy%C3%A8-Mystery-ebook/dp/B00HZ6EELS/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>Because We Are</i></a>, a moving mystery story set in Haiti with net profits donated to charity.

<p>Two years ago, I had the idea for a new and compelling story set in India. In 2015, I traveled to New Delhi to research it, and connected with remarkable nuns from Mother Teresa’s Missionaries of Charity and dedicated groups serving sex workers and their vulnerable children.</p>
<p><strong>And so <i>Little Flower</i>, my most creative, engrossing story yet, was born.</strong></p>
<p>Human trafficking and modern-day slavery are oppressive realities in India, but there are some shining lights working to right these wrongs.

<h3>What's <i>Little Flower</i> about?</h3>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i><strong>Little Flower </strong>chronicles the unique bond shared by two damaged souls: Sister Shanti, a mischievous, elderly nun from Mother Teresa’s Missionaries of Charity, and Meeta, a young prostitute with dreams of a life lived outside the brothel. Thrown together when a young man they love is murdered, they embark upon a darkly comic journey through New Delhi’s underbelly in a search to understand the curious crime that has stolen him. As they plunge ever deeper into mystery and peril, they are forced to confront a cast of colorful characters and the contradictions that run through the center of every human soul, all before arriving at an unforgettable final revelation that shocks as much as it inspires. </i></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>Utterly endearing and completely moving,<strong> Little Flower </strong>stands as a testament to the wild and unwieldy power of love in its many forms.</i></p>

<p>In 2003, while a college student, I was first confronted with the realities of modern-day slavery. It’s a pernicious violation of victims' rights and a problem rooted in inequality and exploitation of vulnerable children, women, and men. India has the ignominious honor of hosting the largest number of modern-day slaves, an estimated 18 million people.</p>
<p><strong>18 million people. Let that sink in a moment.</strong></p>

Back in 2012, I successfully crowdfunded the release of a ‘nonprofit novel’ called Because We Are, a moving mystery story set in Haiti with net profits donated to charity. Readers liked the book, enough that it was later acquired and re-published in a beautiful new edition by Amazon Publishing. 
Two years ago, I had the idea for a new and compelling story set in India. In 2015, I traveled to New Delhi to research it, and connected with remarkable nuns from Mother Teresa’s Missionaries of Charity and dedicated groups serving sex workers and their vulnerable children.
And so Little Flower, my most creative, engrossing story yet, was born.
Human trafficking and modern-day slavery are oppressive realities in India, but there are some shining lights working to right these wrongs. Just as I wanted Because We Are to leap beyond the page and impact lives, Little Flower will be a tool to inspire readers and help support the work of change-making organizations, Sari Bari, Kat Katha and International Justice Mission.
By contributing to this campaign at any level, you will:
·       Support me and my growing family in this crazy writing venture
·       Help share an important novel with the world about hope and transformation
·       Sustain important work fighting modern-day slavery
What’s not to love?

What's Little Flower about?
Little Flower chronicles the unique bond shared by two damaged souls: Sister Shanti, a mischievous, elderly nun from Mother Teresa’s Missionaries of Charity, and Meeta, a young prostitute with dreams of a life lived outside the brothel. Thrown together when a young man they love is murdered, they embark upon a darkly comic journey through New Delhi’s underbelly in a search to understand the curious crime that has stolen him. As they plunge ever deeper into mystery and peril, they are forced to confront a cast of colorful characters and the contradictions that run through the center of every human soul, all before arriving at an unforgettable final revelation that shocks as much as it inspires. 
Utterly endearing and completely moving, Little Flower stands as a testament to the wild and unwieldy power of love in its many forms.
What other books is Little Flower like?
The Life of Pi. A Thousand Splendid Suns. The Ministry of Utmost Happiness. The God of Small Things. The Vish Puri Mysteries. The White Tiger. A Walk Across the Sun.

In 2003, while a college student, I was first confronted with the realities of modern-day slavery. It’s a pernicious violation of victims' rights and a problem rooted in inequality and exploitation of vulnerable children, women, and men. India has the ignominious honor of hosting the largest number of modern-day slaves, an estimated 18 million people.
18 million people. Let that sink in a moment.
That’s why every contribution to this campaign, no matter the size, will have a portion donated to one of the following life-changing organizations:
Sari Bari – A 'freedom business,' creating opportunities for formerly-trafficked women, employing them to create beautiful things. Donations help their work grow and provide former slaves with alternative livelihoods.
Kat Katha - An Indian organization working to improve the lives of the 2,500 women and children in the brothels of G.B. Road, Delhi's red light district and the setting for Little Flower.
International Justice Mission – Rescuing modern-day slaves in India and around the world and supporting them with social services to reintegrate into society.


Your generosity will be rewarded! If you contribute, here’s what you can expect:

Bloggers published by two of Maine’s largest daily newspapers, the Portland Press Herald and the Bangor Daily News, have featured my work. I have also published on the blog Red Cedar, edited by Great Lakes French-Canadian writer James LaForest. I was an expert contributor to a short film about the Ku Klux Klan in New England and I was interviewed on camera for a film about Biddeford, Maine’s first Franco-American. In September 2016, I was on a panel at the University of Maine, Orono on the topic of the 14th Amendment and Franco-Americans.Where can you learn more about my project?I have made available my book synopsis.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Dr. Nathan Taylor, PhD. I am an Army veteran with PTSD. I have struggled with my illness for years. I now know that effective communication is the key to healing. Impaired communication may prevent veterans from receiving adequate care for other illnesses, and from facilitating meaningful relationships. Veterans are not alone with illness. Many people are impacted by PTSD, its not just a military illness.  By contributing to my campaign you will be giving me the opportunity to publish my book and market it to VA facilities across the USA and beyond. The book will also be available to the public to assist civilians with the illness.  I currently have a VA facility interested in purchasing a bulk order as soon as I am able to publish.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I need $7000.00 to get the book published. I have been able to secure enough for the cover art and to print the cover. The money will be used for publishing the book. The contributions will be going directly into an account specifically set up for the publishing. If I am not able to raise the full amount during the campaign, the funds will remain in the publishing account and I will continue to fund raise.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
</div><div>
<p>Contributing to my campaign will allow me to be able to teach veterans and medical providers how to effectively communicate with each other, with other veterans and with the public. There are several proven methods of communication. My book describes these methods in detail. Not only how to use them, but what my happen when aggressive communication takes place instead of effective communication. By learning how to communicate it gives people with PTSD the ability to obtain an maintain a job, meaningful relationships, and deal with stressful situations in a constructive manner. I am not asking for the contributions to better myself, but to better my veteran brothers/sisters that I see struggling everyday. The foundation of my book is to help providers elicit critical information during an initial exam, This is where effective communication is crucial. Interpersonal skills on the part of the health provider can help shape a patient and their families outlook regarding care.   </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>One of the biggest challenges I see ahead is getting people to just read the book and realize the importance of effective communication. I am qualified to overcome this obstacle by telling my own story. I have been homeless, worked with the VA to bring myself up, and obtain my PhD. I can use my own struggles with PTSD and how learning effective communication has empowered me o be in control of my illness instead of it controlling me.   </p>
<p> </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you are not able to donate would you please spread the word and let everyone know about my campaign. The sooner I can publish my book, the sooner I can start teaching. Please use the Indiegogo share tools.</p>

<h3>The Flash</h3>
<p>In the blink of an eye, humanity has been reversed to a bestial level by “The Flash”, an energy pulse of unknown origin. All higher thought processes have been erased, removing every trace of civilization and culture, leaving these new creatures concerned with three things: fornicating, feeding, and fighting.</p>
<p>The survivors must first find one another amid the chaos and destruction. The Scramblers are merciless, swarming over everything and everyone in their path. If they are lucky, those who survived the Flash will pick up the pieces left behind.</p>
<h3>The People</h3>
<p>Abigail and her brother, Aaron, are celebrating her 12<sup>th</sup> birthday at a popular restaurant with their parents. Cameron is working another Friday night behind the grill. Duke, a prison guard, has been placed on leave due to inmate abuse. Recent reports from the media state that the sun has been behaving strangely; a stronger than normal solar storm is expected to hit the Earth over the next week.</p>
<p>The four of them – Abigail, Aaron, Cameron, and Duke – survive the Flash. When they wake up, they find everything they’ve known has changed. Cameron is now in charge of two youngsters he’s never met, and Duke... Duke is still Duke. Cunning and violent, his ambition is far greater than the small town he lives in.</p>
<p>As Cameron and the kids come to grips with the threats they face, Duke returns to the prison he was barred from, where he settles in preparing for the unknown. They all hope to find sanctuary; while they have survived, those who were Flashed are different. They can’t speak. They can’t reason. They are no longer human, but still in human form.</p>
<p>Their struggles start in their respective small towns, until they eventually face each other in Atlanta. But after a decade trying to survive in the city, it becomes obvious they need to move...</p>
<h2>ELSEWHERE </h2>
<p>Atlanta is decaying as it slowly runs out of resources.  The survivors of the Flash dream of living Elsewhere... A place where they can run in the grass, grow crops in real dirt, and not have to live with the constant threat of both human and scrambler attacks. Elsewhere becomes a dream, a catchphrase, “anywhere but here; Elsewhere”</p>
<p>Abigail, Aaron, and the residents of 'Decktown', a re-purposed parking deck in downtown Atlanta, have <i>found </i>Elsewhere. While they work to flee the city, Duke is watching, coveting... and once they leave the concrete shelter of their home, they'll have a hundred miles of scramblers to contend with.</p>

<p>My name is Nina Leipold. I am a former dolphin trainer, NAUI open water SCUBA certified diver, free diver, and mermaid! Yes, that's right, I'm a mermaid. I have always had a passion for the ocean and as of recently our oceans are in a lot of trouble. I started a business to promote ocean conservation - a mermaid business. </p>
<p>As I started paying attention to what people care about, I began brainstorming about what I can do to get people to not only care about the ocean but also make the changes needed to help protect it. I quickly learned that people have a fascination with mermaids. I learned also, that if people feel connected with something, they are more likely to change their behavior to save it. This brought on the very difficult task of starting up a mermaid business. I get them to care about me and my ocean friends, then educate them on how they can make small changes day to day that will make a huge difference for our oceans.</p>
<p>All of the children's books I write have a message of ocean conservation and help children understand what the issues are and what small changes they can make to help. For example, the Mermaid of Hilton Head book is about sea turtles being deterred from the beaches when they need to lay their eggs because of the lights on land. The solution? Simply turn your lights off, or close your blinds at night. We have had an overwhelming response to the books, which have been offered only in soft cover as of now. We have been asked by so many people to get the books hardcover, and have even lost sales because of this. I want to reach as many people as possible to get these important messages out there.</p>
<p>This is something I am very passionate about because these books are the best way to reach the generation who will be most effected by the ocean's current health and the ones who can really make the change. With your donation, I am planning to print all of the books hardcover, while keeping them at an affordable price to reach more people. The paper will also be a higher quality, giving the illustrations a more vibrant color. I am also planning to add new titles to the series, increasing the educational value. </p>
</div><div><h3> </h3></div></div>","My name is Nina Leipold. I am a former dolphin trainer, NAUI open water SCUBA certified diver, free diver, and mermaid! Yes, that's right, I'm a mermaid. I have always had a passion for the ocean and as of recently our oceans are in a lot of trouble. I started a business to promote ocean conservation - a mermaid business. 
As I started paying attention to what people care about, I began brainstorming about what I can do to get people to not only care about the ocean but also make the changes needed to help protect it. I quickly learned that people have a fascination with mermaids. I learned also, that if people feel connected with something, they are more likely to change their behavior to save it. This brought on the very difficult task of starting up a mermaid business. I get them to care about me and my ocean friends, then educate them on how they can make small changes day to day that will make a huge difference for our oceans.

<h3>Why an Indiegogo campaign</h3>
<p>Our goal with Indiegogo is to find readers for this first issue and to help jump start the first year of <i>PLACE...in the making </i> with a fundraising goal of $7,500.  We have invested our own funds into designing the first issue  because we believe this is a subject that resonates with people.  Our contributors to this first issue have worked with us at below market rates because they too believe in the idea.   The portion of the goal needed to cover printing costs for issue One of <i>Place..in the making </i> is $7,500.  Funds collected beyond that amount will help with covering the design costs and contributor fees for issue two Spring/Summer 2018.  </p>
<p>Our perks were selected to included a variety of objects that capture the character of New England.  The perks are made by contributors to the magazine.  All the perks are either already made or set to go into production within the coming weeks.  You will receive perks in time for the gift giving season.  We hope you like the selection.  There are some beautifully crafted items included in the list featuring techniques of making that are growing more and more difficult to find: hand screen printed yardage and weaving with antique shuttle looms-  these items tell the story of New England. <span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'> Please consider a contribution so we are able to reach more readers and grow the publication in the coming year.  Thank you!</span></p>

PLACE...in the making   is a  print publication & online Makers' Market launching in the Fall of 2017.  It's a celebration of New England through the eyes of makers, photographers and architects.  Essays, stunning photos and reflections on the region, explore the characteristics that create a ""Sense of Place.""  Contributors share how they make connections to the region through their creative process.  Whether it's a photo of the landscape, a building in the landscape or a vessel made from the earth of the landscape,  all are ways of making connections to New England   explored in PLACE...in the making.  
 

 


We've been working on issue One of PLACE..in the making  for months, and it's nearly ready to be printed, shipped and in your hands  by early November.  In addition to the print publication, we have curated a Makers' Market comprised of uncommon goods from small batch makers featured in the magazine.  The Makers' Market  offers ethically made, thoughtfully crafted products  that bring the beauty of New England home.

<h3>My First Thriller Novel Project<br/> </h3>
<p>People always call me by my ""middle name"" which is Nasrul. I come from a middle class family of five. I'm currently studying at a college about 350 km from my house and yes, I'm always homesick. I love writing. Writing is just my life. I can't live without writing. Since my parents are teachers, I was always seen as the smart one in class although let's be honest here, I'm not. However, I can say, my teacher always praises me for my writing. Which makes me happy :P</p>
<p>I'm currently finishing my first ever novel's manuscript. It will be self-pusblished on amazon (kindle publishing). It is not my first self-publishing ""book"". A few months ago, I self-publshed a short story (around 3000 words long) to get an overview of how kindle publishing works. I advertised my short story on some advertising platform and I find out its too expensive for a poor college student like me to afford. So, I need your help to advertise my first ever novel. It is very important to me because I spent years developing the idea for the novel. The novel is about a girl who lost her dad after a terrible incident. Her life then revolved around her mother, kid and few other person. By donating in this campaign you can help me to advertise my book to help me reach out to the whole world. </p>
</div><div>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">For my project to be possible, I need at least $500 dollars.  I will use the advertising features in kindle publishing and the rest will go to other affordable advertising platforms. If there is any remainder, I will use it for the part of the book. If it is possible, I </span>would<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> also hire one of my friends </span>design<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> a better cover for my book. </span></p>
<p><strong><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Here is what you will get if you donate:</span></strong></p>
<p>1) For any amount, I will place your name in the book plus, I will write an appreciation page with your name written in it, thanking you for your contribution</p>
<p>2) For $5, I will send you a thank you card signed with my name ( it will be sent electronically however because I need to safe money sorry :( ).</p>

<p>Writing this book isn't easy. I had to change my plot many times after I reread it again and again because some parts bore even me. I wouldn't say this project is risky but I definitely would be lying if I said so. After self-publishing a short story few months ago, I know that it is not each to convince people to buy your book but I can tell you one thing. Even if I don't get many people to buy my book, I won't ever give up. I will never think that I wasted any time writing my book. To be honest, I'm someone with zero confidence level and yes, I'm a pessimist. I'm not even sure if you are still reading but I would like to thank you if you do. Even if you don't donate or cannot afford to donate, you can still help me out. Simply share the link to my campaign on Facebook, Twitter, etc. OR you can simply tell people about my book which would be very cool. Lastly, thanks for reading. </p>
</div></div>","My First Thriller Novel Project 
People always call me by my ""middle name"" which is Nasrul. I come from a middle class family of five. I'm currently studying at a college about 350 km from my house and yes, I'm always homesick. I love writing. Writing is just my life. I can't live without writing. Since my parents are teachers, I was always seen as the smart one in class although let's be honest here, I'm not. However, I can say, my teacher always praises me for my writing. Which makes me happy :P
I'm currently finishing my first ever novel's manuscript. It will be self-pusblished on amazon (kindle publishing). It is not my first self-publishing ""book"". A few months ago, I self-publshed a short story (around 3000 words long) to get an overview of how kindle publishing works. I advertised my short story on some advertising platform and I find out its too expensive for a poor college student like me to afford. So, I need your help to advertise my first ever novel. It is very important to me because I spent years developing the idea for the novel. The novel is about a girl who lost her dad after a terrible incident. Her life then revolved around her mother, kid and few other person. By donating in this campaign you can help me to advertise my book to help me reach out to the whole world. 

For my project to be possible, I need at least $500 dollars.  I will use the advertising features in kindle publishing and the rest will go to other affordable advertising platforms. If there is any remainder, I will use it for the part of the book. If it is possible, I would also hire one of my friends design a better cover for my book. 
Here is what you will get if you donate:
1) For any amount, I will place your name in the book plus, I will write an appreciation page with your name written in it, thanking you for your contribution
2) For $5, I will send you a thank you card signed with my name ( it will be sent electronically however because I need to safe money sorry :( ).
3) For $10, I will send you a thank you card (by mail, as in real card) signed with my name.
4) For $20, all of the above and I will send you a copy of the book for free and signed with my name.
5) For $50 and above, I will send you a copy for the book for free, plus a free bookmark plus all al the perks stated above.
If I don't reach my goal, the funds will still be used but for a more affordable advertising service
Why you should donate:

</ul><p>We will be able to ship orders within the United States via USPS Media Mail at a reasonable rate. However, some of you will undoubtedly notice that international shipping fees are substantial. We want to assure our backers that the domestic and international rates are our actual estimated costs, and we have not included any fluff for “handling”. </p><p>We base these rates on two primary factors:</p><ul>
<li>We ship the majority of our international orders via FedEx International and/or United Parcel Service (UPS), which are express shipping services that offer a higher standard of care than traditional national postal services. These shipping providers provide our international backers with accurate tracking information.</li>
<li>The dimensions and weight of the different versions of the book do not permit us to simply toss them in a padded envelope. We package our books with great care so that they can arrive to you in excellent condition. Proper packaging of the book increases the dimensions, and together with the significant weight of the book, combine for an unavoidably high shipping fee.</li>
</ul><p>With any crowdfunding campaign, estimating and charging shipping costs is difficult. We know that you are contributing a substantial amount for each reward.

  Hamilcar Publications is an independent publisher based in Boston. We launched the company in November 2017. Since then we’ve published thirteen titles, with four more to be released in 2021, and several others in the pipeline.We started out publishing books about professional boxing. We know boxing, and knew we could become the category leader in that niche—then we would expand into hip-hop, which of course dovetails perfectly with the fight game.Hip-hop is woven into two of our boxing titles, first in our book about Muhammad Ali’s hype man Drew Bundini Brown, Bundini: Don't Believe The Hype, and even more so in the forthcoming and groundbreaking, Beatboxing: How Hip-Hop Changed the Fight Game.Hamilcar is based on two founding principles: we know the subjects we publish about backward and forward, and we know how to make exceptionally beautiful books. We believe you’ll find both on display if you choose to back From Boom Bap to Trap. Our goal is to ship all editions by June 2022.Riley is hard at work interviewing, researching, writing, and illustrating.All of our books go through a rigorous production process, including copyediting, typesetting, and proofreading.After we send the book to the printer, we need to approve proofs. A work of art like this requires an exacting proofing process.The eBook, music, digital print-ready posters, and playing cards will all be available before the books ship. We will deliver each goody as they are ready.We will be sending you updates along the way—about the progress we are making and about extra goodies, including interviews with producers featured in the book.The estimated shipping weights of the various versions are as follows:
Paperback 1.95 lbs
Special Edition 2.5 lbs
Collectors Edition 4 lbs
We will be able to ship orders within the United States via USPS Media Mail at a reasonable rate. However, some of you will undoubtedly notice that international shipping fees are substantial. We want to assure our backers that the domestic and international rates are our actual estimated costs, and we have not included any fluff for “handling”. We base these rates on two primary factors:
We ship the majority of our international orders via FedEx International and/or United Parcel Service (UPS), which are express shipping services that offer a higher standard of care than traditional national postal services. These shipping providers provide our international backers with accurate tracking information.
The dimensions and weight of the different versions of the book do not permit us to simply toss them in a padded envelope. We package our books with great care so that they can arrive to you in excellent condition. Proper packaging of the book increases the dimensions, and together with the significant weight of the book, combine for an unavoidably high shipping fee.
With any crowdfunding campaign, estimating and charging shipping costs is difficult. We know that you are contributing a substantial amount for each reward. It would just be hard for us lose money every time we ship a reward, which would of course defeat the point of crowdfunding. We appreciate your support and understanding! RISKS & CHALLENGESPrimary Risks & Challenges:
Manuscript-completion timing.
Production delays.
Printing delays.
Hamilcar Publications has been publishing books for three years. As of this project’s launch, we have successfully published thirteen titles, all with international distribution. Four more titles will be released in 2021, two of which are at the printer.Riley is an experienced author and journalist. He has already completed 30 percent of the manuscript and 20 percent of the illustrations.Hamilcar's Publisher, Kyle Sarofeen, has more than twenty years of publishing experience, sixteen of which were spent in production and manufacturing roles for companies like Elsevier, Quarto, and Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. At Elsevier, he managed over a hundred book projects from manuscript to bound book, at Quarto he was in charge of print production for two imprints, and at Houghton Mifflin Harcourt he was the lead print buyer for the Curious George series.Our book designer, Brad Norr, has completed all design work. We work with the best book manufacturers and component suppliers in the industry. The printing and manufacturing slots for all editions will be locked in months ahead of time to avoid delays.",18.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>The Moment That Changed Me<br/>
</h3> <p>In February 2012, I was crossing a crosswalk at a busy intersection when I was hit by a car and knocked into a truck.  As well as physical injuries to my knee, neck, and wrist, I sustained a complex concussion which has taken longer than usual to heal.  Most MTBIs (mild traumatic brain injuries -- brain injuries which do not result in a coma) resolve themselves within six months or so.  Mine has been remarkably stubborn.  But the biggest challenge has been getting used to being what I call ""Karen 2.0."" <br/></p>
<p>In short, my personality has changed.  I am not the same woman who stepped off the sidewalk that day.  The person I am now is unrecognizable to who I was before, and my relationship with myself -- my sense of who I am, being able to trust myself -- has been tricky to rebuild.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Pilgrimage</h3>The most significant change is that I crave simplicity and purpose, a paring-down of my life, taking out the unnecessary.  I cannot process too much at once: too many colours, too many sounds, too many questions, too much stuff, too much stress... It's all physically painful.  As it is healing, my brain is rewiring itself to be more mindful, more present.  It doesn't have time or room to process too much at once.<br/><br/><p>I read <i>Walden </i>more than twenty years ago, and I found myself remembering Thoreau's words -- ""I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately,
to front only the essential facts of life ..."" Suddenly those words resonated within me in a way that they never had before.  I began rereading <i>Walden </i>a couple of months ago, and the more I read, the more a voice deep inside insisted, ""You must go to Walden Pond.""</p>
<p>I am a published author -- I won a couple of national short fiction awards when I was in university -- and I have been planning to write a nonfiction book, called <i>Crossing the Street</i>, about my experiences since the accident.  It has been a learning experience, a series of highs and lows, but I have not begun the book because I don't know the ending.  I have a sense that I'm not there yet.<br/></p>
<p>In the last month there has been a growing certainty that the final chapter of the book is waiting for me at Walden.</p>Not only will this trip be a pilgrimage to Walden Pond, but it will help me get back in touch with myself, give me a sense of accomplishment in having made this trip by myself, and allow me to write a book that will reach out to other survivors of brain injuries and those who love them.<br/><br/>I <b>must </b>go to Walden.  Of this I am certain.  <br/><br/>
</div> <div> <h3>What I Need Your Help to Do<br/>
</h3> <p>The plan is to take a twelve-day road trip to Concord, Massachusetts in October 2015.  Because my brain tires easily, I will require a great deal of rest, so the trip needs to be spread out over almost two weeks, including travel time.<br/></p>
<p>This is what I plan to do there:</p> <ul> <li>Visit Walden Pond and the site of Thoreau's cabin, spending as much quality time there as possible</li>
<li>Visit other literary history sites in Concord, including the home of Ralph Waldo Emerson, Thoreau's mentor and another Transcendentalist whose work also inspires and resonates within me.</li>
<li>Book a total of four days at <a href=""http://thoreaufarm.org/writers-retreat/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a writing retreat in the room where Thoreau was born at Thoreau Farm</a>.  There I will begin laying out and writing <i>Crossing the Street</i>.</li>
<li>Take a day trip via commuter rail to Salem, Massachusetts.  The Salem Witch Trials is one of my pet history topics, and I will need a ""break day"" -- a shift of my brain's gears -- in the middle of my writing retreat. <br/>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Why I Need Your Help</h3>To do this trip the way I need to do it (with ample rest) will cost about $3500.  The biggest expenses are accommodations and food, and I have also factored in gas, getting my passport, the fees for the retreat, admission fees at historic sites, travel insurance, et cetera.<br/><br/>Because of the brain injury, I have spent the last couple of years having difficulty in working full-time or even being trained for a new job.  Without your help, there is no way I can possibly go to Walden.  I do have a casual job in the tourism sector for the next six weeks (I had been a tour guide for twenty years, and thankfully all the information is still in my head!), but all earnings from that job must go towards my day-to-day ""real life"" living expenses.  (The one exception: any tips I receive in American funds are going into a jar marked 'Walden or Bust!"")<br/><br/><h3>In case you're wondering ...<br/>
</h3>If I am not able to raise enough funds by my planned departure date, I will put the funds in a bank account and save it for my next opportunity (likely in the spring).<br/><br/>Should I raise more money than needed for the trip, I will use it to help pay for needs that are related to my injuries (rehabilitative therapy, for example), and look after other day-to-day expenses during the writing of <i>Crossing the Street</i>.<br/><ul></ul> </div> <div> <h3>My Trip is Your Trip!</h3> <p>I'm a born storyteller; I want to share the experience with you as much as I can.  As a result, <a href=""http://waldencalling-apilgrimage.blogspot.ca/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">I will be blogging daily</a> so you can see how I'm doing and feel as if you are travelling with me, and I will be creating a memory book as well.  I have deliberately chosen my perks so that you can participate with me as much as possible.  I may even leave a stone for some of you at the site of Thoreau's cabin!<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>I have been dealing with being ""neurologically compromised"" long enough now that I know how to work around it.  Although I have managed a couple of solo trips in the past couple of years, there is always a possibility that I may need more rest than anticipated.  I have factored in a ""buffer zone"" in the financial goal.  Stress is one of the biggest factors in brain fatigue, so the added peace of mind will be beneficial as well.  <br/><br/>I have also been researching the route via Google Maps and Streetview, and will be travelling at non-peak hours for traffic.  I decided on commuter rail for the trip to Salem so I don't have to drive that day.<br/><br/>This trip will not be easy but I have every confidence that I will be fine, and the sense of achievement of having done it is something that will go a long way towards healing the less-tangible wounds from the accident.<br/>

to move you toward your brightest future possible.
Divorce is the end of a marriage,
but it can also be the beginning of a fulfilling life for everyone involved. 
While I
practice law in Arizona, the principles of my approach to divorce can be applied
from coast to coast. That’s why I’m writing a book that will help people become
unmarried without ruining the rest of their lives — and help couples with
children transition from husband and wife to partners in parenting. 
With your
help, I’ll raise the $22,000 I need to turn my manuscript into a published book
within the next six months. The money I raise through this campaign will cover
the costs of manuscript development, design, editing, production, printing,
and shipment to you!
In
exchange for your support, you’ll be among the first to receive this
life-changing book. In fact, as soon as you contribute, you’ll receive an
excerpt from the book — and continuous updates throughout the process.
Thank you
so much for contributing and/or sharing this campaign with people you think
could benefit from a divorce that keeps conflict and confrontation to an
absolute minimum. Your support could change someone’s life dramatically…Maybe even
your own!",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

independent (aka indie) publishing house that four writing friends have
started/are starting. Said friends are A. E. Moseley, Sarah Swanson, Samantha Liggio and R. A. Odum.</p><p>Our goal is to combine the best of self-publishing (author
control of what they write, covers and release dates), with the best of
traditional publishing (marketing, large readership, publicity help) while
creating inventive collections and books that inspire and challenge readers. </p><p><b><b>2. Why the name Inked Paws?</b></b> The
 name Inked Paws comes from our logo of a puppy with a quill and inky 
paws. Yes we're fun loving and creative, similar to a bouncy puppy (or 
any young animal for that matter), but we're dedicated and passionate 
about what we do.
</p><p><b><b>3.  </b><b>What’s so great about traditional
publishing?</b></b> Traditional publishing reaches a greater audience, because
books are more easily placed in libraries, schools, and physical bookstores.
That allows a wider variety of people, and those who can't afford e-readers,
access to your books. Traditional publishing also provides help with publicity,
and we plan to provide blog tours, book signings, web-chats, Youtube videos, and
even more as we increase our reach. Publishing houses also garner more respect
from readerships because they know they are getting professionally vetted
quality.</p><b>
</b><p><b>4.  </b><b>What’s so great about self-publishing?</b>
Authors get to pick everything. Covers, release date, what they write, total
control over their publicity, and more. These choices mean that the book is truly
what the author envisioned. The cover reflects the book as does the description.
Readers don’t have to second guess if what they see on the cover is what they
are really going to get. When the author chooses their release date they are
not being pressured to meet a short deadline that a company has created for
them, therefore they are able to truly take their time and perfect their book
before releasing. </p>
<p><b>5.  </b><b>If I choose to donate where will my money
go? </b>When you choose to donate you can either send the money directly via Paypal or through credit card. Both methods are secure. Until a bank account is established for Inked Paws (which requires a LLC), the money will be held by one of our members then transferred to the Inked Paws account. This is what you will see when you donate, a name, not the business name Inked Paws Publishing. Not only is this something that we <i>want</i> to do to keep trust, but it is also legally stated in the Indie Go Go terms of service that we must use the money as stated in our campaign. When you donate rest assured that your money is going to a good cause and that it will be used the way it's supposed to be used. You're protected and so is your money! <br/></p><p>With all that being said, there is a lot that is going into
Inked Paws so here is the list of our needs. We have decided to round up to the
nearest 100 so that we will not fall short of our needs and be left dry before
starting (unless there is a set price for the need). All prices are in US dollars. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>LLC licensure ($125): </b>Limited Liability
Company licensure allows Inked Paws to legally earn money and to pay our writers.
This makes us legitimate and also gives us the ability to look into grants for
extra funding. This is a one-time cost.</li>
<li>
<b>Inked Paws Website ($1,000): </b>This
includes the domain name, special email addresses for the company, and a customized
layout that reflects us. The layout, which makes the majority of the price, is a one-time cost. </li>
<li>
<b>Year 1 book ($2,000): </b>To publish one
book costs about $2,000. This covers the publishing and formating of the print
book, the e-books (multiple platforms including Kindle, Nook and iBooks),
cover, distribution and basic press release. </li>
<li>
<b>Publicity for Year 1 book ($1,000):</b> As
we grow our reach we will be able to put more money towards each book’s
publicity. For now each book gets $1,000. This includes book signings/readings,
blog tours, swag packs. </li>
<li>
<b>Extra money:</b> Any extra money will go
towards the publication and publicity of Year 2 (2016) books, as well as extra
publicity for Year 1 (2015) books. </li>
</ul><p><b>6.  </b><b>What do I get from Inked Paws as a reader?
As a donator? </b>As a reader you get to have access to high quality books that
are in the speculative fiction genre. Speculative fiction is anything that
couldn’t 100% be accurate/done according to science (think Hunger Games, Harry
Potter, Redwall). Inked Paws provides books that inspire and make reader think.
Our books break away from what many readers and writers alike call the “cookie
cutter” formula that is in most Young Adult and Adult literature. We’re readers too and we know
how hard it is to find a book with the right balance of elements. There’s
diversity in the world and we want our books to reflect that. As readers you
get to share in that!</p>
<p>As a donator you get the perks listed to the right
according to how much you donate. But also as a donator you get to take pride
in the fact that you’re helping change the way small publishers are viewed and
what kinds of books make it to the reader. That is pretty empowering. 
</p><p><b>7.  </b><b>I’ve got a book/collection/etc. in the
works. Will you publish me? </b>For the next few years (three or four) we are
not looking for any new writers to join our family. We are so humbled and
honored by all the interest that Inked Paws has gathered from the start but
right now we want our focus on making Inked Paws the very best it can be before
we add any new writers <i>Rest assured when we are ready for more
writers, we’ll make an announcement!</i> We would love to be in touch so please
feel free to contact us at inkedpawpub[at]gmail[dot]com</p><b></b><p></p><br/></div>","A Quick Q&A1.  Who/What is Inked Paws? Inked Paws is an

When you donate rest assured that your money is going to a good cause and that it will be used the way it's supposed to be used. You're protected and so is your money! With all that being said, there is a lot that is going into
Inked Paws so here is the list of our needs. We have decided to round up to the
nearest 100 so that we will not fall short of our needs and be left dry before
starting (unless there is a set price for the need). All prices are in US dollars. 


LLC licensure ($125): Limited Liability
Company licensure allows Inked Paws to legally earn money and to pay our writers.
This makes us legitimate and also gives us the ability to look into grants for
extra funding. This is a one-time cost.

Inked Paws Website ($1,000): This
includes the domain name, special email addresses for the company, and a customized
layout that reflects us. The layout, which makes the majority of the price, is a one-time cost. 

Year 1 book ($2,000): To publish one
book costs about $2,000. This covers the publishing and formating of the print
book, the e-books (multiple platforms including Kindle, Nook and iBooks),
cover, distribution and basic press release. 

Publicity for Year 1 book ($1,000): As
we grow our reach we will be able to put more money towards each book’s
publicity. For now each book gets $1,000. This includes book signings/readings,
blog tours, swag packs. 

Extra money: Any extra money will go
towards the publication and publicity of Year 2 (2016) books, as well as extra
publicity for Year 1 (2015) books. 
6.  What do I get from Inked Paws as a reader?
As a donator? As a reader you get to have access to high quality books that
are in the speculative fiction genre. Speculative fiction is anything that
couldn’t 100% be accurate/done according to science (think Hunger Games, Harry
Potter, Redwall). Inked Paws provides books that inspire and make reader think.
Our books break away from what many readers and writers alike call the “cookie
cutter” formula that is in most Young Adult and Adult literature. We’re readers too and we know
how hard it is to find a book with the right balance of elements. There’s
diversity in the world and we want our books to reflect that. As readers you
get to share in that!
As a donator you get the perks listed to the right
according to how much you donate. But also as a donator you get to take pride
in the fact that you’re helping change the way small publishers are viewed and
what kinds of books make it to the reader. That is pretty empowering. 
7.  I’ve got a book/collection/etc. in the
works. Will you publish me? For the next few years (three or four) we are
not looking for any new writers to join our family. We are so humbled and
honored by all the interest that Inked Paws has gathered from the start but
right now we want our focus on making Inked Paws the very best it can be before
we add any new writers Rest assured when we are ready for more
writers, we’ll make an announcement! We would love to be in touch so please

<p>It's been a calling...a journey of discovery...a leap of faith. And I've met amazing people everywhere I've gone.

The Plan
Our goal is to publish a book called A Peace of My Mind:
American Stories, a collection of portraits and personal stories gathered from
across the country and built around the simple question, “What does peace mean
to you?”


The Past

In a world that asks us to focus on the things that can
separate us, A Peace of My Mind is a multimedia arts project that encourages us
to consider the common humanity that connects us.
Founded in 2009 by photographer and author John Noltner (me), we published our first award-winning book with 50 stories gathered in Minnesota. This collection was also produced as two exhibits that travel the country and serve as a catalyst for dialog about conflict resolution, civic responsibility, and social
change.




The Pitch
Now we have a brand new collection of stories, gathered from across the country. We need your help to share these inspiring stories in our second book called A Peace of My Mind: American Stories. The simplest way to help is to pre-order this new book, and encourage your
friends to do the same. Our goal is to release our new book on September 21, the International Day of Peace. Books will ship in the fall, making it a
great gift for yourself, or the person you know who could use a little more
peace in their life. Of course, you can also support this effort at a higher level to help us reach our goal more quickly. We have exciting perks to say thank you at all levels. You'll find the details listed on the right side of this page.

It touches us in a way that allows us to see the world from a different perspective. Perhaps it will inspire us to become peacemakers.” - ELA GHANDI , SOUTH AFRICAN PEACE ACTIVIST AND GRANDDAUGHTER OF MAHATMA GANDHI


The Longer Version
 Over the past three years, I have driven 40,000 miles across the United States asking people the simple question, ""What does peace mean to you?"" 


I've worked for 20 years as a freelance photographer, producing images for national magazines, Fortune 500 companies, and non-profit organizations. I've always appreciated the rich diversity of the people I've encountered, but over the years I have become increasingly concerned with the divisive nature of our national dialog...the way we are asked to focus on the things that can separate us.
In a world that had become increasingly polarized, I set out to use my photography and storytelling to rediscover what we have in common...to look for the humanity that we all share....and to celebrate what is good.
It's been a calling...a journey of discovery...a leap of faith. And I've met amazing people everywhere I've gone. I've interviewed survivors of violence, refugees, civil rights activists, artists, ranchers, veterans, ex-prisoners, and many others. These fascinating people from all walks of life have revealed extraordinary insights and honest stories that explore ways we can
work toward common good and create a world that is more just for all. 

The interviews are complete, the photos are taken, and the text is edited. Now I need your help to share these stories of hope in a new book that celebrates our common experience and builds a deep sense of community.


""The words and the faces in John Noltner’s book invite us in, and encourage us to slow down and to reflect on what matters most.” - JOHN BIEWEN, AUDIO PROGRAM DIRECTOR, CENTER FOR DOCUMENTARY STUDIES, DUKE UNIVERSITY

The Book
We have planned a 160-page, full color, soft-cover book. 8-1/4""x 11"" in size. Each person will be featured on a 2-page spread, with a large, full-color portrait, a brief biography, and a 300-600 word excerpt from their interview.

In the back, we will list a short collection of discussion questions that you can use with your family or book club to explore some of the themes and issues raised in the stories.
If you donate at the $100 level or higher, your name will be listed in the back of the book as a supporter.
Our planned release date is the International Day of Peace, September 21, 2016. I can't imagine a more appropriate day to bring these stories into the world.


“ Honest humanity comes shining through on every page, with every word and photo. I have no doubt whatsoever that this book will serve as a wonderful trailhead for those seeking to find and walk the path of Peace.” - GARY BERGSTROM, FROM THE EXHIBIT GUEST BOOK

Our perks are built around pre-orders for the book.  We welcome your help at any level and have developed an exciting collection of rewards as our way of saying thank you for your support.

You can have your name listed on the book's sponsor page for $100 or more.
Make plans for your book club or social group and get 12 books for $250.

If you're feeling especially generous, you can even host a multi-media keynote presentation or one of our nationally-touring traveling exhibits in your community.

The Challenge

For the past year I have pursued the traditional publishing route...with an agent and a publisher...and I continue to hear the same response. ""This is an amazing project, with beautiful photos, and insightful text...but we don't think we are going to make enough money off it...so good luck.""

No more waiting...now is the time.

I am either stubborn or foolish (sometimes it's hard to know the difference) but I believe the world needs this message now more than ever. Everywhere I share these stories, people are touched. They are inspired. There is work to do, and these stories can encourage people to pursue their own paths toward making the world a better place.

If you believe we can do better, please help us reach our goal. If you believe that you could use a little encouragement of your own, donate today...and plan to hold this book in your hands before the year is done.

If we meet our goal, we will print 3,000 copies of our book. If we pass our goal, we have a few exciting options:


We can produce a larger print run of the book.
We can create a traveling exhibit...as we've done with the first book...and make these stories available to audiences across the country.
We can hit the road and bring these stories from coast-to-coast, building community and encouraging others along the way.

<h3>Napkin Diaries: Poetry Petite</h3>
<p> This campaign has ended but you can still be a contributor by contacting us directly at napkindiary@gmail.com</p>
<p>Napkin Diaries is a collection of ideas that began as observations, poems, sketches and lyrical ideas scrawled in haste on Cocktail Napkins; the most readily available medium for a gigging Jazz Musician as he ran from stage to bar, before the notion was lost forever in the haze of the next moment, the next improvisation, the next song. Somehow these napkins were stashed away and survived five moves, two expeditions, a divorce, two earthquakes and a resuscitation.</p>
<p>Then, during one of the excavations of a storage unit, a few of the old napkins flew out and an idea started to grow. David dug through old boxes and suitcases filled with unexplored inventions, song ideas, movie ideas, comedy ideas and angry rants. He pored over them and began to rework these thoughts, honing them down to the purest essence of thought. Eventually deciding to use an old manual typewriter to put them back on his medium of choice: The Cocktail Napkin.</p>
<p>Napkin Diaries began appearing on instagram and facebook in April of 2015 under the anonymous username dbwii. it can now be found at <a href=""http://www.instagram.com/napkindiary"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.instagram.com/napkindiary</a></p>
<p>In February of 2016 the first volume of Napkin Diaries was published; but, there's more than just the stories to this story.</p>
<p>I need funding to publish the first 1000 books in soft-cover and create an accompanying CD of spoken-word and Jazz to go along with the book and I'm seeking your help to do it.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Napkin Diaries isn't just for reading, it's for listening too. </h3>
<p>I'm seeking $10,000 in funding to produce the first 1000 copies of books and CDs of the spoken work. Unlike other projects, this material is already created, you can review it online and decide if you want to be a part of the final project.</p>
<ul>
<li>To print the first 1000 books I will need approximately $6000. The book has already been created and is being sold online at blurb.com but funders will receive special copies as well as some other unique items.</li>
<li>To record, mix, master, design and press the first 1000 CDs I will need approximately $4000.</li>
<li>Funders will be given an exclusive invite to attend the taping of the spoken word project as soon as the project is funded.</li>
<li>Funders will recieve a special, signed and certified copy of the book and of the CD.</li>
<li>For each $100 investment, funders will also receive two tickets to a private concert and reading by David Patrone and his Jazz band.</li>
<li>Funders who donate $500 or more will recieve an original Napkin Diaries Artwork of their choice, as in, the ACTUAL napkin that was photographed and used in this book or others that have been featured on our social media accounts. Obviously this is a first-come, first-served option although funders may also select two Original Reproductions of the napkins which are created in exactly the same way as the original and all come with a signed and embossed Certificate of Authenticity.</li>
<li>There are lots of other perks available including singing telegrams and voicemail recordings and even a private concert anywhere in the US.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Many of you know me personally and have spent some time at my shows. You know the quality of work I produce. Napkin Diaries is the creation I am most of proud of in my life. When I first published Napkin Diaries, I didn't realize how excessive the cost would be for fans to buy the work from the printing company. I had no money to print copies in bulk so I'm offering lots of added value to get a large run published. This campaign is a way to get a bunch of copies printed so that I can distribute the rest of the copies to publishers in an effort to get published by a major publishing house. It also makes the work more financially accessible to people at our shows and readings and will be something tangible I can give to people at speaking engagements on creativity, PTSD and recovery:</p>
<ul>
<li>This campaign is not making me a bunch of money. It's primary purpose is to have copies to get to publishers and to sell copies at shows at a reasonable price.</li>
<li>I believe Napkin Diaries is a significant artistic work which will stand the test of time.</li>
<li>This is the first of at least ten volumes which are estimated to be published.</li>
<li>Napkin Diaries addresses several serious issues I have faced in my life including recovery, PTSD and the creative process.  It has already created an impact in the lives of many, from people in addiction recovery to my fellow veterans, high school audiences and spiritual seekers,</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Five years ago I would have been able to just throw down the money and publish this all without asking for help from you folks but the fact of the matter is that things have been tough in the last few years. I'm grateful for the challenges because they are the reason I was able to write these works. I'm not accustomed to asking for help from people and that's something I've had to accept lately too. Your support makes it possible for me to continue creating interesting projects.  Without your support I probably would have split town for the next life a long time ago.</p>
<ul>
<li>The things I share in this book are intensely personal and I have been warned that they would hurt my career; but, I came to a decision that it was more important to be honest than to be safe.</li>
<li>I promise you that this is just the beginning of a long literary relationship.</li>
<li>These poems and excerpts are honest and revealing glimpses into my heart and soul. I don't pull punches when it comes to my writing.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you are unable to donate or invest I can certainly appreciate that. In the last several years I have been homeless, without a vehicle, lived on a boat, rode my bike and even took public transportation to shows. There were days when I had to decide whether a can of soda was worth the bus fare and as a result I have a whole new appreciation for the impact of five bucks. There are still some things you can do to help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make a contribution of any amount, even 5 bucks can go a long way.</li>
<li>Post this campaign on your social media.</li>
<li>Use the convenient indiegogo tools to share our instagram and facebook or other SM pages.</li>
<li>Introduce your friends to my work.</li>
<li>Hire us for a gig! Hire me to do a singing telegram!</li>
<li>Come to my shows and shake my hand. Let me know you dig it.</li>
</ul>

I
am a college senior at the University of South Carolina and have one semester
left before I graduate in December 2015. I am a Mass Communications
major and have a number of skills. I can film and edit video. I have also written a few
articles for an independent magazine and the school’s “Garnet&amp;Black”
magazine. 

Two
of my articles can be found on my blog at ""<a href=""https://plus.google.com/+TommyRobelot/about"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://plus.google.com/+TommyRobelot/about</a>""                        1)<a href=""http://aletheiaampelos.blogspot.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://aletheiaampelos.blogspot.com/</a>                         2)<a href=""http://humanitylost2vice.blogspot.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://humanitylost2vice.blogspot.com/</a>
<p>I grew up
overseas in Belgium and France, and have visited most of Europe so I have an international, multicultural background. I am bilingual
in French and English and speak a little Spanish. I am not fluent in Russian or Ukrainian but
I am willing to learn. <br/></p>
<p>The plan is to raise enough money to intern at the Kyiv Post. The Kyiv Post is Ukraine's first English-speaking newspaper. It was founded in 1995 and started from practically nothing. Their modo is ""independence, community and trust,"" and they've covered everything from the Euromaiden Revolution to the Russian occupation of Crimea. I was hoping to meet the media crew
this summer and return post-graduation to work
more extensively. Having a multicultural background has allowed me to become
strong and confident. I am not afraid to write the tough stories nor am I intimidated by scary situations. <span></span><span>I really want to expand my knowledge
and challenge my comfort zone. I am not looking for an easy job. I want to do
the hard work in order to gain perspective and pursue a career in journalism to
achieve the experience necessary to succeed.      </span>
<br/></p>
<p>Being able to make this trip to Ukraine will allow me to pursue my career goals and follow my dreams. It would mean the world to me! I need at least 3,000 dollars to cover the airplane ticket, food, housing and transportation. The cost of the ticket alone is anywhere from $1,600 to $2,000. I need to reach this goal at least by July 1st but I would prefer to leave by mid-June. <br/></p>
<p>The stories I am assigned will enlighten my experience. I would love to connect with people who are interested in reading my articles and discovering other projects involved. </p>
<p>If I do not reach my entire goal this summer, the funds will be saved for post graduation, in December, where I will attempt a second trip to Ukraine with the intention of staying for a few years in a paid position. <br/></p>
<p>Ukraine is in a fragile state. The conflict between the Russians and Ukrainians is a real threat to their democracy and freedom. While many are fighting for a sovereign nation, the internal struggle with government corruption, corporate greed and fascism continues. I want to be able to make an impact now and in the future. This trip is very important for establishing familiarity, rapport and making the right connections. </p>
<p>Depending on where they place me and what I will be reporting, I could be covering dangerous stories --the war, government corruption, the Russian occupation etc. It will be a risky challenge but an incredible opportunity. Ultimately, I am not in a comfortable financial situation. I will be renting out my room for the summer to focus on this objective. I need support and people who believe in pursuing their dreams. Thank you so much in advance. <br/></p>

Most are filled with unrealistic advertisements telling me I am not enough. Fashion models without flaws flaunt clothing and makeup I can not fathom wearing. Headlines shout from newsstands telling me ""five ways” I can lose weight, tame my frizz, tone my abs and have a cleaner house. </p><p>Meanwhile, I yearn to feel connected to what is real, what is true. Maybe you feel it too? </p><ul>

</div></div>","Welcome to Lucia Hi, I'm Laura Lowery, founder and editor of Lucia. Thank you for finding your way here. I’m excited to share this project with you.Lucia is a new kind of magazine. Independent and ad-free. Our mission is to inspire and enlighten the world by giving voice to the heart and celebrating true beauty. Why Start Lucia?This journal was born from my heart’s longing…to be moved, feel inspired, and connect with what is real. I often feel inundated with imagery and content in women's magazines that competes to capture my attention in order to sell me stuff. Most are filled with unrealistic advertisements telling me I am not enough. Fashion models without flaws flaunt clothing and makeup I can not fathom wearing. Headlines shout from newsstands telling me ""five ways” I can lose weight, tame my frizz, tone my abs and have a cleaner house. Meanwhile, I yearn to feel connected to what is real, what is true. Maybe you feel it too? 

Lucia is different. You won’t find advertising or airbrushed models in our pages. Instead you will find incredible personal writing and essays, beauty, magnificence and truth – loads of it.

Lucia is beautifully designed. Full color, 108 pages, 7.5 x 9.5 inches, and filled with heartfelt essays, photography and art from inspiring women and men. Gorgeous typefaces combined with handwritten script in beautiful inks on thicker, softer, responsibly-milled paper makes reading and turning each page feel so good.

Lucia is authentic, heartfelt, and curated to spark creativity. This is a magazine unlike any I’ve ever seen before. 
Why We Need Your Help Making an ad-free magazine is expensive. It can be self-sustaining, but not until we reach a certain circulation. Based on the interest and excitement for Lucia (we are already on the shelves at Whole Foods, and soon Barnes & Noble) we feel confident Lucia will grow.We can't get there without your help. Our Kickstarter campaign this past May had a goal of $60K, an amount that would have enabled us to fund the creation and printing the first three issues of Lucia. We raised more than $20K, but we couldn't accept any of it because we did not meet our goal. This platform (Indiegogo) will enable us to keep whatever is contributed, even if we do not meet the goal we've set. Issue Two is written, designed, and ready to print. It is gorgeous. I am hopeful we can raise the funds to print the second issue, and keep Lucia moving forward! In addition to Whole Foods and Barnes & Noble, we are ready to keep growing our subscription base and new subscribers are finding Lucia every day.
Lucia represents something the world needs. Some nights I can not go to sleep because I am so busy thinking about all of the women and men out there who might connect with and be inspired by Lucia. How many creative fires might a journal like this encourage and spark? Could even one change the whole world for the better? Gives me goose bumps. 
Lucia has a solid business and marketing plan. My background of nearly 20 years in communications and PR, including more than 10 years running my own creative business, has helped immensely with this project. I’ve developed cash flow projections for what it will take to make Lucia profitable and sustainable as quarterly publication. It is a big lift, and will take some time to get there. 
Creating and printing a high-quality full-color periodical with no advertisements is expensive. In order to fund the printing of Issue Two we hope to raise at least $20,000. Anything beyond this goal will help us be able to compensate Lucia’s incredible writers, contributors, design and editorial advisors, and contribute to printing costs for Issue Three.
Lucia: On Giving BackLucia is not your ordinary magazine. We are passionate about community. In fact, we think community is the antidote to the negative effects of all those ads in magazines selling unattainable ideas of perfection—our communities are where we get real; where we feel appreciated for giving voice to our hearts; where we find true beauty; where we support and inspire each other. From the very beginning I've envisioned Lucia as a business that gives back. While the rules prohibit us from donating any proceeds of this campaign to charity, the rules do not prohibit us from deciding that we intend to donate a portion of Lucia's FUTURE profits (after funds have been used to successfully create Issue Two). As a hopeful and heart-centered entrepreneur, it is my intention to do so. What does that mean? As Lucia grows beyond Issue Two, we plan to return 5% percent of our profits to the community each year by donating to inspiring nonprofit organizations that directly support women. We are serious about this commitment and though we’ve not yet made a dime of revenue, we are hopeful and have already spoken with New Beginnings, a nonprofit that empowers survivors and mobilizes community awareness and action to end domestic violence. They love our idea, and we are planning to give 5% of our first profitable year's profits to them.Gifts for Lucia’s Sponsors We are excited to share perks with you! As one of Lucia's founding patrons, you will be join a community that is all about making meaningful connection, giving voice to the heart, and celebrating true beauty.Whether you can afford to contribute $15, $100, $1,000, or more, you’ll receive heartfelt thanks and great perks. Check out the photographs & details of our rewards packages below, Lucia has something for everyone. If you don't see a gift you would like at the level you are willing to contribute, please let us know.

<p>My name is Taylor Wilkins, and I recently started The Tailored Quill, a privately owned creative startup in Denver, CO, that helps people with any kind of writing, editing, and public speaking. </p>
<p>The fear of public speaking is still number one in the world, ranked even higher than death, and studies continue to show that where students in all grades demonstrate the most insufficient skill is in writing and grammar.  To address this fear and deficiency, I've built ten categories of services designed to accommodate a wide range of possible projects for clients of all ages, all of which are customizable based on the client's specific creative needs. </p>
<p>This campaign serves as the first big step toward getting the word out and making the following services available to the public. Services for content creation, outlining, editing, as well as composition and oral practice (when applicable) are available in the following categories:</p>
<p><b>1. Professional materials</b>: resumes, cover letters, and letters of intent.</p>

</div></div>","Who I am


My name is Taylor Wilkins, and I recently started The Tailored Quill, a privately owned creative startup in Denver, CO, that helps people with any kind of writing, editing, and public speaking. 
The fear of public speaking is still number one in the world, ranked even higher than death, and studies continue to show that where students in all grades demonstrate the most insufficient skill is in writing and grammar.  To address this fear and deficiency, I've built ten categories of services designed to accommodate a wide range of possible projects for clients of all ages, all of which are customizable based on the client's specific creative needs. 
This campaign serves as the first big step toward getting the word out and making the following services available to the public. Services for content creation, outlining, editing, as well as composition and oral practice (when applicable) are available in the following categories:
1. Professional materials: resumes, cover letters, and letters of intent.
2. Business development: website editing, press releases, LinkedIn profiles.
3. Wedding toasts: Best Man, Maid of Honor, Father of the Bride, etc. 
4. Longer speeches: keynote addresses, corporate lectures, school presentations.
5. Academic material: homework papers, thesis projects, magazine articles.
6. Full length pieces: novels, children's books, articles, etc.
7. Composition:  freelance blogging and ghostwriting.
8. Public Speaking: business, personal, etc.
9. Specialized: corporate marketing materials, book tours, speaking engagements.
10. Community: writing and public speaking workshops, small group activities.





I have written fiction since I was eight years old, have helped people all around the world with editing and rehearsing their own writing for the past decade, and have been seeing clients through The Tailored Quill since the start of this year while also working two other jobs.   
Your contribution will help me build The Tailored Quill, about which I am super excited and confident, into a business on which I can focus full time. Whether for yourself or as a gift for a friend, please contribute at the level with which you feel comfortable. Even simply ""sharing"" the campaign page over social media and spreading the word to someone you know who might be in a wedding this year or has to make a presentation at work will be extremely helpful.

   What I Need


To build this into a full time business, I hope to raise $15,000, which will be used primarily for:


1. Logistical support, such as an actual office space for the company (at the moment, my office is a backpack...),


2. Technological support, such that I can smoothly address all clients' needs remotely as well as connect and consult with clients all over the world,


3. and Business development, which would include marketing materials, advertisement opportunities, and ongoing website development and maintenance.

I've created a detailed list of perks that are offered in a progression that logically follows my service categories but with some fun twists. Spoiler alert: there's something for everyone and each purchased perk can still be tailored to your needs. Any contribution will help because it means I can begin supporting and spreading my passion to more and more people and take the first step towards creating a community around writing and public speaking.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi! I'm Rachel Miller, author of <i>Winter's Prey</i>, the first book in the <i>Barren Fields, Fruitful Gardens</i> series.</p>
<p>I don't know about you, but one of my favorite childhood memories is of story times when a parent or teacher picked up a book and began reading, bringing a whole new world to life. This same beauty is found in the world of audiobooks.</p>
<p>Winter's Prey is an amazing story of the struggles and conflicts of life in the Montana Territory and one family's journey of faith and survival. While the story is fiction, many readers of this book and its sequel have written, expressing the healing, hope, and encouragement found in its pages. Thus, the purpose of this project is to bring this story and its message to life.</p>
<p>Converting Winter's Prey to audio is a longtime dream. Now, due to the generosity of one man who has offered his experience and knowledge as guides through the process, it is becoming a reality.</p>
<p>I believe converting this book to audio will impact and even change lives. This campaign gives us the opportunity to work together to be a part of making that change possible.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need $3000 to properly carry out this project. The funds from this campaign will make it possible to hire a professional voice actor to narrate the book as well as covering additional fees, taxes, and expenses associated with the process. The narrator will be hired through Audible's ACX platform, which will then allow for distribution of the audiobook through Audible, Amazon, and iTunes.</p>
<p>We've come up with some great perks for those who back this project, including copies of the audiobook, the paperback version and its sequel, even lavender from my own garden. We're also creating a special event  for anyone who not only backs the project, but who gets someone to match their pledge. This event will be an invitation only, pre-launch, book preview event for the upcoming Book #3! At this event, you'll be among the first to see the book trailer, receive early electronic files, and we may even have a short reading!</p>
<p>If we don't reach our goal, (which we really hope doesn't happen) the funds will still go toward making this project a reality...it will just take us longer to get there.</p>
<p>If we surpass our goal, the additional funds will go into marketing the audiobook, and potentially even toward converting the second book Field of Ashes to audio as well! (Wouldn't that be awesome!!)</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Winter's Prey is a fiction story that intersects with real life on many levels. I have received multiple emails from readers saying, ""Rachel, this story is exactly where I am."" They then go on to share how the book has encouraged them to walk in contentment, take a better approach in a certain relationship, or offered comfort in the face of grief or struggles. One reader said that the BFFG books are full of hope-giving truth.</p>
<p>Imagine the impact this would have on a whole new group of listeners, who might never have the time, opportunity, or ability to sit down and read it!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The hardest part—the writing and publishing—is already done. In the past, one of the biggest challenges I faced when considering converting the book to audio was knowing who to hire for the narration and how to go about it. Audible's ACX platform eliminates much of the struggle in this area. I am confident we will find the right match for the story.</p>
<p>Now, the biggest foreseeable challenge is the one for which this campaign was designed—covering the production cost. We estimate the book to be between 10-12 hours once completed. Including associated fees, taxes, and expenses, the total cost will be around $3,000. This is our second attempt. Our first attempt went really well, we just ran out of time before we reached the goal. I believe since we already have a few people on board, we'll get off to a great start and an even better finish!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Maybe you aren't able to back the project financially at this time, that's okay! You can still help! One of the biggest challenges is getting the word out. Trying to do it all by myself would be almost impossible. Please feel free to use the Indiegogo share tools. I will be posting regularly to Facebook as well, and you are more than welcome to share any of those posts.</p>
<p>Another great idea is to share the trailer for the book or even the video for this project and tell why you're sharing it and why this project is important to you. When people know you're interested in it for a reason, they're more likely to check it out. (Always include a link back to this page.)

<h3>Will you LEAD the change?</h3>
<p>Unleashing the potential of all people – regardless of their gender, background or skin colour – offers huge benefits for the economy, for our health and wellbeing, and for wider society.</p>
<p><strong>We know that you recognise this.</strong> We know that you are already making great strides to create a diverse and equal workforce. We know that you have got a great story to tell. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Diversity is an issue whose time has come.</strong></p>

But others are lagging behind. <br/><br/><strong>LEAD: Leadership for Equality and Diversity</strong> will provide leaders with the insight, information and resources they need to create workforces that are truly representative and that allow everyone to shine. </p>
<p><strong>Investing in LEAD today</strong> will enable you to accelerate progress further and faster, and will enable us to secure the future of the magazine and the website for many months to come. </p>

<p>LEAD: Leadership for Equality and Diversity comprises:</p>
<p>* A quarterly LEAD magazine with in-depth features, analysis, interviews and success stories</p>
<p>* A website that is updated daily with news, views and special online-only content</p>
<p>* E-bulletins, special reports and research</p>
<p>* Networking events, including roundtables, receptions and workshops</p>
<p>We have already secured £14,000 and have a further £10,000 in the pipeline - and that is before we have even launched!<br/><br/>But we want to provide an enhanced website, create a superb programme of learning and networking events, and commission some unique research to share with the world. To do this, we need a further £25,000. It is this gap we would like you to help us fill. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Your Impact</h3>
<p>By investing in LEAD magazine, you will help organisations of all shapes and sizes access the tools, insight and inspiration they need to create diverse and inclusive workforces. In turn, this will mean more women and people from under-represented groups have the opportunity to achieve their potential.</p>
<p>The economy will benefit. Society will benefit. You will benefit. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Achieving our goal will be no mean feat. But we think we are up for the job.</p>
<p>Sheenagh Baxter Martin is a successful publisher who has launched magazines, websites and events in three countries. She has organised events in Buckingham Palace and Parliament, launched and relaunched publications and provided senior leaders across politics, the public sector and business with up-to-date information to support their activities. </p>
<p>Becky Slack is an experienced editor and journalist with expertise in business, charity, diversity and leadership. She has written and edited for the Guardian, New Statesman, Independent, Evening Standard and several trade magazines. She is a published author (Effective Media Relations for Charities) and the founding director of a successful PR and comms agency, Slack Communications. </p>

We are passionate about using our combined 50 years' experience in publishing and journalism to bring about the change we want to see. </p>
<p>Together, we are confident that we have the skills and expertise to make LEAD magazine a success. We are fully committed to this project and have already invested more than 500 hours of own time - without pay. </p>

To do this, we need a further £25,000. It is this gap we would like you to help us fill.

Fake news happens when any entity or individual's opinion decides to inject itself into the facts of a story. And on every network, on every radio station, on nearly every website, this is all we see. Undeclared bias masked as objective reporting. Anonymous sources that are not checked so long as they fit a narrative. Easily put: Fake news.</p><p>The solution to Fake news is a return to a media which truly is independent, able to accomplish ethical investigation and declaring any biases up front for the reader to judge. Commentary derived from news labeled as such, so that the battle of ideas is not fought between real and fake but right and wrong.</p><p>Halsey Media has been growing rapidly since its inception in early 2017. From a premiere news site, which started its first month with 13,000 unique visitors, Halsey Media now has 3 launched sites, 3 YouTube channels, 4 podcasts, 4 additional sites and broadcasts slated for summer 2017, and a fully functioning internet radio station with multiple shows. We also have 7 affiliated sites which we share content with, but do not exert any type of creative control. All told, sites in the Halsey News Network are visited by more than 2 million people a month and we are experiencing exponential growth. The only question is, what we can do with this growth?</p><p>We currently have 7 sites owned by Halsey Media, some of them already launched, some launching soon.</p><p>They are: </p><p><strong>Halsey News (halseynews.com)</strong>: Our flagship site, which features hard hitting commentary from an array of political perspectives. Halsey News breaks the barrier in terms of uncensored, fact based investigative journalism. You will find topics such as elections, international affairs, culture, media and government along with many others. The site is currently live and is visited by more than 300,000 people monthly. The site is backed up with a YouTube station and podcast by Halsey Media President, Halsey English, called Halsey Live. </p><p><strong>Right Millennial (rightmillennial.com): </strong>The home of Halsey Media co-owner Stefanie MacWilliams. After experiencing the devastating effects of Fake News first hand, Stefanie did the opposite of what most would do, she took to the airwaves. Blamed by the Washington Post and Toronto Star for creating the vast Pizzagate Conspiracy, Stefanie received death threats and almost left the business. Instead she fought back, and is one of the most highly read and trafficked site for Right Leaning Millennials on the planet. Monthly traffic of over 150,000 visitors a month and backed up by her own YouTube channel and show called Right Millennial. </p><p><strong>Counter Campus (CounterCampus.com)</strong>: Spearheaded for launch in August of 2017, Counter Campus aims to report on the socialist takeover of our educational system and what can be done about it. Headed by celebrated author, Tiana Dalichov, Counter Campus will go where no one dares go to question education and its effects on the country. Podcast and YouTube station to follow shortly after launch. </p><p><strong>D.I.R.E. Online (direonline.com):</strong> Headed by Halsey News contributor Brian Hendrix, D.I.R.E. stands for Documenting Islamic Radicalism Everywhere. The site will be launching in late July 2017, and will feature not only commentary about the rise of radical Islam throughout the world, but will feature a safe repository for users to upload video, audio and testimony about Islam without fear of governmental censorship, as exists in other countries. D.I.R.E. will make sure the videos and audio of Islamic radicalism do not get lost and are readily available for those who wish to use them to educate others about the danger of open borders and Islamic Radicalism. </p><p><strong>Troll The U.N. (trolltheUN.com):</strong> The United Nations is the centerpiece of international law in the world, but very few know about its inner workings. Iran and Saudi Arabia being elected to women's rights bodies, the massive focus on Israel’s perceived evils, and the whitewashing of Islamic Radicalism are just a few topics to be addressed on this hard hitting site, commanded by Halsey News Investigative Manager, Justin Farrell. Troll The U.N. is set for launch in August 2017. </p><p><strong>Media Indictment (mediaindictment.com):</strong> Headed by F1 engineer and African American activist Marc Comvalius, Media Indictment is a hub for stories about Fake News and its effects on our society. Set for launch in late July, 2017, Media Indictment will serve as a true fifth column and will allow for honest reporting about the media and what they are doing to shape the narrative in the world. </p><p><strong>True Stories (truestoriesonline.com):</strong> The brain child of Halsey News contributor, Jamie LaGrow, True Stores will launch in August, 2017 to cover the medical field from a scientific and natural point of view. Nutrition and other topics will also be discussed by our experts. </p><p>Philosophically, Halsey News Network is based on the principle that empowering independent writers and broadcasters to become career journalists requires a vast array of knowledge and experts on-staff to guide those, both new and old, from hobby to career. Halsey News Network employs 18 professional writers, 6 broadcasters, 4 programmers, 2 SEO experts and 3 website designers. Additionally we have audio/video consultants on retainer. This is the point of our fundraiser and our vision.</p><h3>We need you to contribute to our growth</h3><p>We are wholly independent, funded solely by owner contributions. We have been offered investment capital by multiple sources, but it was inevitably offered with strings attached. Ceding of editorial control, adding sections for sports and Hollywood gossip, or just plain censoring our most popular writers, were not pills we could swallow. Instead, we are asking the public to join us in our quest to raise $500,000 to grow our own network while offering various ways for others to get involved.</p><p>We are here to make waves, to shift paradigms, and to challenge narratives - not just to make money. We are a group of free-thinking individuals with one thing in common: every one of us has put our blood, sweat and tears into independent media. We are passionate. We believe, wholeheartedly, in what we are doing.</p><p>When you support our cause, you are providing the resources we need to take our passion to the next level and to empower others.</p><p>We don't work for corporations and big-money investors.</p><p>We don't work for special interests.</p><p>We don't work for a political party.</p><h3>We work for you.</h3><p>We want to do a whole lot more.</p><p>It is time to empower us to grow even further. We have already amassed an unprecedented reach and audience, and we have so much more to do. We have built studios, purchased equipment, designed sites, brought on partners and have grown well beyond our hopes. Now we wish to bring this to the next level with your help.</p><p><strong>Your contribution to this campaign will be put to use in several ways by the Halsey News Network:</strong></p><p><strong>Content. </strong>First and foremost, these financial resources will allow us to always be able to put as much focus as possible on our bread and butter. We have been honored with thousands of loyal readers, watchers, and listeners. Our number one priority is delivering as much high-quality content as possible. We want to keep hiring more contributors to write, broadcast and edit so that we can launch them into new ventures where their expertise can be utilized. We foster growth in all of our contributors, and we plan on using a decent portion of the funds raised to meet those goals.</p><p><strong>Equipment</strong>. While we have what we need in terms of equipment for our established entities, our new sites and affiliates need more equipment. Whenever we launch a new initiative, microphones, cameras, computers, editing software and other equipment needs to be bought.</p><p><strong>Upkeep. </strong>Web hosting, web design, tech support, and graphic design are just a few of our ongoing costs – costs that will only continue to grow as we expand our network to include more sites, shows, and radio programs. Professional, high-quality site design and branding is something we have prioritized from the beginning, and we never want to have to settle for an inferior--or worse, non-functional--design to cut costs.</p><p><strong>Staffing. </strong>We all, to a man, consider independent media to be a passion. We couldn’t quit even if we wanted to – our hearts are in it! While we have worked with minimal resources since our launch, the proverbial “labor of love” approach is not a sustainable business model. Eventually, we and our staff need to make enough money not only to be able to reinvest into our company, but to also take care of our own financial needs. For a few of us, that means taking a 6 month salary so that we can focus all of our working energy on Halsey Media. For others, that means writers and broadcasters getting paid a fair amount for their services.</p><p><strong>Time. </strong>The crux of our challenge is this: for us reach the level where we can truly classify ourselves as an alternative to mainstream media outlets, we need time to build. We have seen so much success since we began – we can only imagine the level of growth we will be able to achieve with more time and more resources. No company can “survive” forever. We need the time to become independently profitable, at the level we need to thrive as a business. That’s where this campaign comes in.</p><p>These same needs are shared, in different ways, by our affiliates.</p><h3>How our affiliates work and what makes this campaign different</h3><p>About half of our sites are Halsey Media-owned: Troll The UN, DIRE Online, Media Indictment, Counter Campus, Right Millennial, True Story, and of course our flagship site, Halsey News. These sites are owned and operated by us. Some are fully launched as of this campaign, some are still being designed, and a few are awaiting a bit more content before they are released to the public.</p><p>The other half is comprised of our affiliate-owned sites: Deplorable Radio, New Media Central, The Resistance Podcast, Preuss Media, Remso Republic, and Gold Goats N Guns.</p><p>Though the owners of these sites are friends with us and often work closely with us (some even write for Halsey News), these sites are not owned by us, nor are they operated by us at Halsey Media.</p><h3>This is important</h3><p>Whatever we raise in the course of this campaign will be split 50/50. Half will go to Halsey Media, and the other half will be split among our six affiliates.</p><p>We did not charge anyone a penny to join us in this campaign and, more importantly, we did not ask for a single bit of equity or any decision-making stake in any of our affiliate companies.</p><p>Even if this campaign raised ten million dollars, half would go to our affiliates. Period.</p><p>We did this for one reason.</p><p>We do not simply want to grow Halsey Media. We want to give the public more choices, more opinions, and more access to truly independent media outlets.</p><p>We have no interest in becoming a mass corporate media outlet ourselves, or a place where we rule the content of our own publications with an iron fist. We want to fund media freedom, and that starts with our talented affiliate partners.</p><p>The only control we have over our affiliates is quality control – we picked people who were committed, talented, and hardworking. People and companies that we deeply believe in and proudly read, watch, and listen to ourselves. We had everyone submit a budget with the understanding that no one was to spend more than 10% of their funding take on their own salary.</p><h3>This is a movement</h3><p>This campaign is about more than Halsey Media.</p><p>This campaign is about more than our affiliates.</p><p>This campaign is about sending a message to the gatekeepers of the mainstream media: We are not afraid of you. We don’t want you. And we definitely don’t need you.</p><p>Yes - every contribution to this campaign, from one dollar to a thousand dollars, will go toward funding the Halsey News Network as a group. Even more than that, though, every contribution will show the mainstream media, the alternative media, and the general public just how much power that We The People can have when they band together for something in which they believe.</p><p>Again: we need you</p><p>Passion has gotten us this far – and perhaps a touch of faith, too.</p><p>Our readers, watchers, and listeners have put in us their faith. They have taken the time out of their lives to engage with us and our content. We consider that to be a great gift, and to give them content that is worthy of their attention is, for us, a big responsibility. Whether you are a long-time follower of our content or of our affiliates' content, or even if this is your first time here, thank you for reading this far and thank you for giving us your precious time.</p><p>Writing a pitch is never easy. You have given us so much. And yet, we must ask you for one more thing. Money.</p><p>We are asking for your hard-earned dollars, dollars that could go toward a dozen other things at any given moment. It’s not a small thing in principle – we know this. However, there is a beauty to crowdfunding.</p><h3>How much you give is not the biggest factor.</h3><p>Our goal is $500,000 dollars.</p><p>A lot of money.</p><p>500 people could give us 1,000 dollars.</p><p>5,000 people could give us 100 dollars.</p><p>50,000 people could give us 10 dollars.</p><p>And, of course, 500,000 people could give us 1 dollar.</p><p>Truth is, it will be a mixture of these numbers, and numbers in between.

<p>Hola, mi nombre es Miguel Angel Pulido y soy un amante de las pruebas deportivas de resistencia. En la actualidad estoy disfrutando mucho de un deporte que descubri hace seis años, EL TRIATLÓN,disfruto de él, en muchas de sus variantes, como pueden ser por ejemplo, el duatlón de carretera, el duatlón cross, el triatlón de carretera y como no, el TRIATLÓN CROSS, que es en particular la modalidad a la que pertenece el XTERRA.</p>
<p> El motivo por el cual abro esta campaña es porque me dan la opción de ir al Cto del mundo de esta modalidad, que se celebrara el 1de noviembre en MAUI (HAWAII),para mi sería increible poder asistir a ese campeonato, ya que creo que me encuentro en un buen estado de forma y  podría obtener un resultado muy razonable...este año ya fuí subcampeon de Europa de mi grupo de edad en la modalidad de duatlon en distancia corta (10km correr/40km bici /5km correr).(ITU)</p>
<p> Para poder afrontar este campeonato necesitaría unos 3500euros que corresponderían a los siguientes gastos: 500eur inscripción,1500 vuelos,1000euros hotel,500 euros seguros, alimentación,desplazamientos...</p>
<p>Sería increible poder completar una vida deportiva con esta participación ya que mis participaciones internacionales se reducen a una maratón de Nueva York en el año 2009 siendo el 81º  de unos 42000 participantes(2h33) y este año el Campeonato de Europa de Duatlón que se celebró en Madrid.</p>

<span>Hi, my name is Miguel Angel Pulido and I'm passionate about endurance sports competitions.

Nowadays I enjoy practicing a sport which I found out about 6 years ago, TRIATHLON, I enjoy it in many of its different versions, such as: road and off-road duathlon, road triathlon and most certainly, OFF-ROAD TRIATHLON, which is particularly the version XTERRA belongs to.
<br/> The reason why I launch this campaign is because I've been given the option to take part in the off-road World Championship, which will be celebrated on the 1st of November in MAUI (HAWAII). <br/>  Attending this championship will be incredible for me as I believe I'm in a good condition and I could get a very reasonable result...so far this year I've come 2nd in my age group in the European short distance duathlon Championship (10k running/40k cycling/5k running).(ITU)
<br/> To be able to face this championship I'd need around 3500 which will correspond to the next expenses: 500€ for the inscription, 1500€ for the flights, 1000 € for the hotel, 500€ for insurance, food, travels...

It would be amazing to complete my sport career with this participation since the international events I've taken part in are limited to a New York marathon in 2009 finishing 81st out of 42000 competitors (2h33) and the European Duathlon Championship in Madrid this year.
<br/><br/>Other facts:

San Sebastián Marathon: 2h21
Half marathon: 1h07'

</div></div>","Hola, mi nombre es Miguel Angel Pulido y soy un amante de las pruebas deportivas de resistencia. En la actualidad estoy disfrutando mucho de un deporte que descubri hace seis años, EL TRIATLÓN,disfruto de él, en muchas de sus variantes, como pueden ser por ejemplo, el duatlón de carretera, el duatlón cross, el triatlón de carretera y como no, el TRIATLÓN CROSS, que es en particular la modalidad a la que pertenece el XTERRA.
 El motivo por el cual abro esta campaña es porque me dan la opción de ir al Cto del mundo de esta modalidad, que se celebrara el 1de noviembre en MAUI (HAWAII),para mi sería increible poder asistir a ese campeonato, ya que creo que me encuentro en un buen estado de forma y  podría obtener un resultado muy razonable...este año ya fuí subcampeon de Europa de mi grupo de edad en la modalidad de duatlon en distancia corta (10km correr/40km bici /5km correr).(ITU)
 Para poder afrontar este campeonato necesitaría unos 3500euros que corresponderían a los siguientes gastos: 500eur inscripción,1500 vuelos,1000euros hotel,500 euros seguros, alimentación,desplazamientos...
Sería increible poder completar una vida deportiva con esta participación ya que mis participaciones internacionales se reducen a una maratón de Nueva York en el año 2009 siendo el 81º  de unos 42000 participantes(2h33) y este año el Campeonato de Europa de Duatlón que se celebró en Madrid.
 otros datos y marcas deportivas:
  Maratón 2h21 San Sebastian, media maraton 1h07, 5000ml 14'40"", 3000ml 8'36"" ...
Para cualquier aclaración no dudes en contactarme a través de miguelangel.pulido@uclm.es 
muchas gracias por tu ayuda y recuerda  que gracias a tu aportación lo conseguiremos, ¡¡¡un abrazo!!!

Hi, my name is Miguel Angel Pulido and I'm passionate about endurance sports competitions.

Nowadays I enjoy practicing a sport which I found out about 6 years ago, TRIATHLON, I enjoy it in many of its different versions, such as: road and off-road duathlon, road triathlon and most certainly, OFF-ROAD TRIATHLON, which is particularly the version XTERRA belongs to.
 The reason why I launch this campaign is because I've been given the option to take part in the off-road World Championship, which will be celebrated on the 1st of November in MAUI (HAWAII).   Attending this championship will be incredible for me as I believe I'm in a good condition and I could get a very reasonable result...so far this year I've come 2nd in my age group in the European short distance duathlon Championship (10k running/40k cycling/5k running).(ITU)
 To be able to face this championship I'd need around 3500 which will correspond to the next expenses: 500€ for the inscription, 1500€ for the flights, 1000 € for the hotel, 500€ for insurance, food, travels...

It would be amazing to complete my sport career with this participation since the international events I've taken part in are limited to a New York marathon in 2009 finishing 81st out of 42000 competitors (2h33) and the European Duathlon Championship in Madrid this year.
Other facts:

San Sebastián Marathon: 2h21
Half marathon: 1h07'

3k: 8'36""

<p>                My name is Lucas Luna, but everyone calls me Acero (The spanish translation for Steel).

<p>            We made this to get the necessary founds to edit the book in physical format, wich is,in my way to see the world, the best way to enjoy a book. We plan on editting the Bible in Spanish, English, portuguese for now. German/ French may be an option for the future.</p>
<p>                Some time after publishing the book (the paper format of course), we will put the digital format at the hand of the whole comunity. So everyone can access to the ""Bible"" and it's information. To improve their playing skills and enjoy a great book.</p>
<p>       <strong>We need your help &amp; will have your proper reward</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>We need 2.200 U$D (something like 34.000 AR$, my country, and the place where the printing will take place). this money will be used to afford the cost of edition. printing and if  possible, the distribution of the final product. (Remember that Shipping is not included on donations)</p></li>

Summary</b></p>
<p>Mental illness affects people of all
backgrounds yet many people of color go untreated. According to the <a href=""http://minorityhealth.hhs.gov/templates/browse.aspx?lvl=3&amp;lvlid=539"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>Office of Minority Health</span></a>, African
Americans are 20% more likely to report having serious psychological distress
than Non-Hispanic Whites. High school aged Hispanic girls are 70% more likely
to attempt suicide than White girls of the same age. According to the American
Psychological Association,""Barriers such as language, culture and little access
to care keep many Asian Americans from receiving help for mental illness"".</p>
<p><b>The Color of Hope: People of Color
Mental Health Narratives</b> is a
project that sheds light on mental illness in communities of color by compiling
and publishing a book of stories from those affected by mental illness. 
By publishing these stories, we open up discussion around the topic and break
through stigma and shame.</p>
<p>We have received over 20 interviews,
narratives, and poems from children, adults, parents, men, women, artists,
activists, students, politicians, and prisoners...all of whom are of African,
Asian, and Latino descent. All of our contributors live with or have been
affected by a loved one with major depression, borderline personality disorder,
post-traumatic stress disorder, bipolar disorder, and/or schizophrenia.</p>
<p><b>Meet the Curators:</b></p>
<p><b>Iresha Picot, M.Ed, BSL </b>is a Licensed Behavior Specialist, and has a Master’s Degree
in Urban Education Policy and Post-Graduate work in Women Studies from Temple
University. In addition to a Master’s Degree, she has Post-Graduate
certifications in Applied Behavior Analysis and Autism. Currently, Iresha works
in the Behavior and Mental Health fields as a Licensed Behavior Specialist and
Therapist and is currently a Lead Clinician in a School Therapeutic Treatment
program. Iresha is also a Birth Doula and a Prison Abolitionist.</p>
<p><b>Vanessa Hazzard, LMT</b> is an internationally trained Licensed Massage
Therapist, writer, and healing arts educator from Philadelphia, PA. She has had
her poetry and narratives featured in Elephant Journal, For Harriet, Recovering
Yogi, and Apiary Magazine’s The Hive. She is currently earning her
Bachelors in Applied Science from Siena Heights University and is a certified
yoga instructor. Vanessa has combined her background in yoga, massage, and
herbalism with social justice movements to raise funds to build an orphanage in
Jacmel, Haiti as well as to aid victim/survivors of human trafficking
. Living with bipolar disorder, Vanessa aims to educate wellness professionals
on the connections between chronic pain and mental illness by developing online
continuing education courses in depression and PTSD. </p>
<p><b>By funding this project, you give a
voice to those enduring the struggles of living with mental illness.Help bring
our vision to life!</b></p>
<p><b>What
We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>To be able to share this book
with larger audience,our fundraising goal is $5000. This money will go towards
printing, editing, formatting, copyrighting, graphic design, website
maintenance and social media management, postage, promotions (including a book
release engagement TBD), distribution, and other costs associated with the
project. </p>
<p>Proceeds from the book sales will go
towards mental health advocacy projects, programs, and/or organizations and
will rotate on a quarterly basis. Iresha and Vanessa are also developing a
program for trauma survivors which includes teaching a variety of coping skills

Summary
Mental illness affects people of all
backgrounds yet many people of color go untreated. According to the Office of Minority Health, African
Americans are 20% more likely to report having serious psychological distress
than Non-Hispanic Whites. High school aged Hispanic girls are 70% more likely
to attempt suicide than White girls of the same age. According to the American
Psychological Association,""Barriers such as language, culture and little access
to care keep many Asian Americans from receiving help for mental illness"".
The Color of Hope: People of Color
Mental Health Narratives is a
project that sheds light on mental illness in communities of color by compiling
and publishing a book of stories from those affected by mental illness. 
By publishing these stories, we open up discussion around the topic and break
through stigma and shame.
We have received over 20 interviews,
narratives, and poems from children, adults, parents, men, women, artists,
activists, students, politicians, and prisoners...all of whom are of African,
Asian, and Latino descent. All of our contributors live with or have been
affected by a loved one with major depression, borderline personality disorder,
post-traumatic stress disorder, bipolar disorder, and/or schizophrenia.
Meet the Curators:
Iresha Picot, M.Ed, BSL is a Licensed Behavior Specialist, and has a Master’s Degree
in Urban Education Policy and Post-Graduate work in Women Studies from Temple
University. In addition to a Master’s Degree, she has Post-Graduate
certifications in Applied Behavior Analysis and Autism. Currently, Iresha works
in the Behavior and Mental Health fields as a Licensed Behavior Specialist and
Therapist and is currently a Lead Clinician in a School Therapeutic Treatment
program. Iresha is also a Birth Doula and a Prison Abolitionist.
Vanessa Hazzard, LMT is an internationally trained Licensed Massage
Therapist, writer, and healing arts educator from Philadelphia, PA. She has had
her poetry and narratives featured in Elephant Journal, For Harriet, Recovering
Yogi, and Apiary Magazine’s The Hive. She is currently earning her
Bachelors in Applied Science from Siena Heights University and is a certified
yoga instructor. Vanessa has combined her background in yoga, massage, and
herbalism with social justice movements to raise funds to build an orphanage in
Jacmel, Haiti as well as to aid victim/survivors of human trafficking
. Living with bipolar disorder, Vanessa aims to educate wellness professionals
on the connections between chronic pain and mental illness by developing online
continuing education courses in depression and PTSD. 
By funding this project, you give a
voice to those enduring the struggles of living with mental illness.Help bring
our vision to life!
What
We Need & What You Get
To be able to share this book
with larger audience,our fundraising goal is $5000. This money will go towards
printing, editing, formatting, copyrighting, graphic design, website
maintenance and social media management, postage, promotions (including a book
release engagement TBD), distribution, and other costs associated with the
project. 
Proceeds from the book sales will go
towards mental health advocacy projects, programs, and/or organizations and
will rotate on a quarterly basis. Iresha and Vanessa are also developing a
program for trauma survivors which includes teaching a variety of coping skills
(i.e. meditation, yoga, bodywork, and writing) in small group settings. A
portion of the funds from this book will be used to offer scholarships for this
program to help people with low or no income.

Working in a startup feels like juggling ten jobs. No matter if you are the founder, marketing manager, lead developer or an intern. Endless hours, long meetings, investor emails, relationships broken, and it all builds up.You often have the responsibilities of multiple people, and are trying to deliver them in fraction of the time.This causes what we call stress and when it becomes chronic it might lead up to burnout or depression.

We need to remember that:


 
The Comedy Book For the Startup Crowd - Everyone In a Startup Needs a Laugh
We have written the first comic/comedy book for entrepreneurs. It's packed satire, puns and humour. We've included many experiences from our own journey, and that of many other people to create something every entrepreneur can relate to.
 


 
So Whats in the Book?
We have split the book into multiple sections:1. Entrepreneur nightmares2. Entrepreneur things that normal people consider weird3. Entrepreneur daydreams4. Startup Jargon5. Everyday situationsGet the book here!Preview into the book:





What does it look like?
The book is a paperback printed with thick glossy paper. You'll love the feel.

 
The Book is Ready to Print
We have secured a book printer that is ready to print hundreds of copies on a moments notice. We have printed a few test copies before our final print run.
A Great Christmas Gift Your ""Startup"" Friends
This Christmas give yourself or your entrepreneur friend, family member or special someone a book. Christmas shopping is always a struggle trying to figure out the perfect gift and this book filled with humour would be one less gift to worry about.
We will hand wrap the book as a beautiful Christmas gift to open on Christmas with a special note from you to your friend.We ship for Christmas for orders done before the 27th of November.Ps. Imagine the excitement of ripping a beautifully wrapped gift on Christmas morning!

 
The Origin Story
We have travelled to nine countries, interviewed dozens of entrepreneurs and have lived in London, Amsterdam, Eindhoven and Helsinki since. We’re deep in the startup scene, and have run our own or been a part of multiple startups. We felt that a bit of comedy was needed in the scene.The idea spawned a year ago when we were making bad jokes around startups, the jargon and how seriously people take things. The book has been gathering jokes and ideas ever since.​Iranthi Gomes
Iranthi is behind a lot of the situational humour and logistics of the book. Iranthi is a Sri Lankan entrepreneur, and with Jarkko has headed companies such as Inventshift, Wheelys Melbourne and ServiceHired. Jarkko OksanenJarkko is crafting the puns, and the comedy of the book, and creating drafts for the illustrations. Jarkko is of Finnish origin, and has an entrepreneur / software background.Now in late 2017 we’ve enough material, and a bit of time to make this happen. 

 
Take your pick! 
 




 
We need your help to make more people smile
We've made a nice chart, so you can see where your dollars (or euros, rupees) are going towards.Every pledge help us keep more jokes coming for the next year.

</h3>Hi! I’m Olivia. I am a writer, English teacher, and artist from NC. I am self-publishing my second novel. The Unbinding is a sequel to The Unfading. They are fantasy, in the vein of C. S. Lewis and George MacDonald. I believe in Madeleine L’Engle’s idea of serving the work. These stories came to me. I am now sending them into the world. As a self-published author, I have funded myself. This is a new venture, to allow others to join in the process of creating this book. I am hopeful and thankful for this opportunity. <br/><br/>
<p>I taught English in Beijing for a summer, in 2006. I enjoy traveling, mostly on my summer breaks and to visit friends or track down literary history. I sponsor a little girl in Nepal through Tiny Hands International. Through reading and research, I have learned about modern day slavery, child labor, and the abuse of women and girls still all too prevalent in our world. I try to support ethical businesses and Fair Trade retailers, as a part of not supporting slavery and child labor. These things, along with my faith, my family, and my little bit of forest, have influenced much of my writing. <br/></p>
<p>Thank you for considering a donation and please keep reading to learn about all the ways you can help. Let's see what we can create! <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>More About My Books: </h3>
<br/>In 2010, I self-published my first novel, The Unfading. I worked on it off and on for six years. I started it while in graduate school at UNC-Greensboro and finished it as an instructor at Alamance Community College. By 2011 I had started the sequel, what was to become The Unbinding. In April of 2012, my mother passed away. Many things were put on hold, but I eventually found my way back to working on this novel.<br/><br/>After a year of searching (and a couple of false starts) I have finally found an editor to go through the final version of The Unbinding. Keep in mind, it was a 400 page manuscript. After that, it comes back to me to proof the editing. Then on to internal formatting, layout, and cover design. If all goes well…it could be in print before the end of the year! <br/><br/>Writing is my love. It’s something I know I am meant to do. When I am writing or reading, I often feel most myself. I will always write. Publishing is another challenge. When I know that the story wants to go out into the world, I have to do my best to send it. It's not easy--though.<br/><br/>The Unbinding is a special story. Not only was it written during the illness and passing of my mother, but it is a fantasy story with a very real heart. It deals with such issues as child labor, oppression, and finding how to best help others whose lives are very different from our own. It also continues the journey of Queen Carina, her family, and friends. A few new characters show up too! <br/><br/>
<p></p>
<h3>The Biggest Challenge: Writing Through Grief</h3>
<br/>This book has been influenced by many things. It started as a 
natural outpouring to follow The Unfading. It is also intimately 
connected with the season my mother’s illness and death. In 2009, my 
mother, Rodema, was diagnosed with ovarian cancer. The Unfading was 
published in 2010. The bulk of the manuscript of The Unbinding was 
written in 2011. Mom read that manuscript. She was always my first (and 
best) reader! <br/><br/>Toward the end of 2011, I was still working on The
 Unbinding. I used my Christmas break for writing. Because I was on 
break, I was also free during the day to take mom to a doctor’s 
appointment. On December 23, 2011, we found out that the cancer was back
 and had spread to her brain. I didn’t work on the manuscript for 
exactly one year. <br/><br/>Mom passed on April 21, 2012. Sometime that 
summer, I opened the manuscript. I thought I might work on it. I saw the
 the “last saved date” of December 23, 2011 and closed it. It was not 
until December 23, 2012, that I opened it again and began 
work. Even after that--it was a long road. <br/><br/>Somewhere along the 
way I realized that not only was it editing that was giving me a hard 
time, but it was grief. I knew that when this novel was finished, Mom 
would not be there to hold it. The day the box came, full of the first 
run copies of The Unfading, it was so exciting. We have a picture of 
Mom, at the kitchen table, beside the box, holding my book. I knew that 
would never be repeated. To finish the book would be to finish it 
without her here. The most difficult thing about writing this book was 
not the writing, or the editing; it was grief. And each day that I keep 
writing is an affirmation that there is still life to be lived--here and
 elsewhere. <br/><br/>This book was also written out of my deep concern 
for children, for the hideous problem of child labor and slave labor, 
and my commitment to supporting Fair Trade products and better 
alternatives—whenever I can. I don’t write documentaries. I write 
fiction. However, truth though fiction is one of the most powerful 
weapons we have in the fight against evil. This book is my small way of 
voicing my concerns, of doing something, of kicking at least a little 
hole in the darkness.<br/><br/>Of course, I also love to read: George 
MacDonald, C. S. Lewis, Madeleine L’Engle, the Brontes, and so many 
others have deeply helped me. Everything I write will always be owing to
 them, in one way or another. Good books keep me going! <br/><br/>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>1. Professional line editing (approximately $3,000.00) <br/></p>Editing is must for a final version, and it is worth it. I am thankful to have great writers and teachers for co-workers. Several of them have given time and effort to go through earlier versions or parts of the manuscript. That was helpful all along the way. It’s also important for the final version to have an overall edit and a consistent one. I have struggled to find the right editor. I finally went back to the company who did the formatting and layout for the first novel. I’m pleased with them. I know my book is worth it. <br/><p><br/>2. Format and layout of the interior, cover design, and e-book conversion (around 700.00)<br/><br/>This includes the type font, spacing, chapter headings, front matter, etc. While I did, for my first novel, provide the cover art, I still needed someone to do the layout. I imagine something similar for the sequel. This also means the novel is format ready to go to amazon’s create space…so that we can have real copies and an e-book! <br/><br/>3. First run copies, promotional materials, and marketing (300.00 goal).<br/><br/>Create Space does mean print on demand, but I also usually order in bulk. Any funding above what I need to get the book ready to print can help in actually getting printed copies. Things like bookmarks, post cards, posters, prints, etc. can also help greatly in spreading the word. While I traditionally haven’t done a lot with paid advertising, there are a lot of options for services for self published writers. Anything above the minimum to get it in print could help greatly in getting the word out to a wider audience. <br/></p>
<p>If you can, please donate to help in publishing my second book. No 
amount is too small, and we’ve come up with some creative incentives for
 you too! Thank you for your time and generosity! <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
</div> <div>
<h3>Why Funding? Why Now? </h3>
<p><br/>For the first book, I paid for everything out of my savings (and through my job as a teacher). While I eventually did recover my costs and start to make a little profit on the book, it was a long road. This time, with a longer novel, and professional editing, it’s going to cost a little more. I am absolutely prepared to back myself. I believe my book is worth it. Launching a book without a deficit to recover would be a great blessing. It would also allow me to focus on writing and sharing, without worrying over dollars and cents. <br/><br/>I also realize that I do most of my writing in a very solitary way. Connecting with my readers and supporters, even before the book launch, would be a very good thing for me. This will be an opportunity to see what we can do, instead of assuming I need to do it all on my own. I’m a little scared about that, but also hopeful and excited. <br/></p> <p>So...I rather imagine by now one of three things has happened: You’ve already stopped reading, deciding this is just too long, you’ve connected and you are on board, or you are intrigued, but not quite ready to commit. Wherever you are is okay. Thank you for giving me (and my book) a chance. If you are still unsure, let us know what information might help. If you’ve already given, thank you for taking the time to read this. I hope something in it inspires you in your own story and adventure! <br/><br/></p>

Most writers are aware of the power of having an e-book. At the same time, many writers fear technology and can't afford to hire someone to prepare their manuscript for electronic publishing.
It's possible to prepare your manuscript without knowing the programming code used in e-books. All you need is Word and step-by-step instructions. Practical Guide: Formatting e-Books for Writers gives you those step-by-step instructions.
Take a look at what you'll learn with this book.
Table of Contents
Sample Chapter
How did I get started formatting e-books? Or more to the point, why did I start formatting e-books? There are two reasons: 1) I like to do things myself to learn the process, and 2) I couldn't afford to hire someone to do it for me. 
The first book was weeks of trial and error. Not because it was particularly hard, but because there was no simple step-by-step guide that spoke to my right brain. During the second book, I started making cheat sheets for myself to ease my way through the process. It wasn't long before I was formatting books for others.
My experience eventually led to teaching others how to format their books. Over the past four years I've been teaching others I've been asked if there's a book. Now there is. 
So, if I'm formatting this book myself, why do I need funds to publish this book?



Editing - No writer, even those of us who are editors*, should skip hiring a professional editor.


Cover Design - I'm a writer, not a designer. I want a professional-looking cover.


Print Design - I will hire a professional to help design the print edition. This is different than the design of an e-book.


Little Details - Every project has little details that need to be paid for. You know shipping materials, advertising, even gas to go to promote this project.


Even if you don't plan to format your own e-book, you can benefit from this project. You will learn  the formatting process, the dos and don'ts of manuscript preparation for your formatting company, plus a list of resources to help you find just what you need to publish your e-book.

You contribution, no matter the size, will make all of this possible. It means this book will be available in March, 2016.
*A special note to editors: More writers are planning to only publish electronically. You can add value to your services by knowing the information in the Practical Guide: Formatting e-Books for Writers. You will be able to help your client have a clean manuscript for the formatting process, while you do your usual editing.   What Is Needed & What You Get 
You can see right at the top; I need $600 to cover the above expenses. I've already been able to negotiate with friends who are professionals to get the best rates possible. (We share our services.)

    What's the Worse That Can Happen? Of course, none of us have any guarantees in life. I have no guarantee that I will get the full funding I need. What happens then?
Here's what has been accomplished so far:


the manuscript is completed,

the editor is editing as you read this,

<p>I am E. A. Hennessy, an author preparing to publish my first novel: <i>Grigory's Gadget</i>. This novel will be the first in my Gaslight Frontier series of steampunk adventure novels, and it will be self-published.</p>
<p>I have been writing science fiction and fantasy stories since early elementary school, and always knew I wanted to publish a novel some day. It wasn't until I participated in National Novel Writing Month (NaNoWriMo) in 2010 that I finally wrote a story from beginning to end (though it was admittedly very rough!). I participated again in 2014, producing a working draft of <i>Grigory's Gadget</i>. After months of editing, sending my manuscript to beta readers, and editing some more, I'm ready to move forward in the publication process.</p>
<p>Because I am self-publishing, there are considerable upfront costs associated with this process. The biggest cost is hiring a professional editor to ensure that my manuscript is up to snuff. I will also hire a book cover designer, who will produce eBook and print book cover designs, social media and marketing images for my novel, and a map of my fictional world. Finally, I will be purchasing ISBNs for each format of my novel. <br/></p>
<h3>The Novel</h3>
<p>Zoya Orlova and her friends decide to leave their freezing authoritarian
 home of Lodninsk to start a new life in the tropical paradise
 of Mirgorod. When pirates attack their passenger ship, the 
friends find themselves caught in a struggle for possession of Zoya's 
family heirloom: a small gadget of compacted gears and wires. Unsure 
what power the gadget holds, Zoya feels she must protect it with her life.
 Will she and her friends be able to make it safely to their new home?<br/></p>
<p>If my campaign is successfully funded, <i>Grigory's Gadget</i> will be available in March 2016.</p>

</div> <div> <h3>Why Self-Publish?<br/>
</h3> <p>The world of publishing is changing, with self-publishing becoming more-and-more common. This puts all of the power and all of the rights into the author's hands, giving them more freedom to tell the story they need to tell.</p>
<p>The downside of this trend is that many writers upload their stories without proper editing and design, which in turn gives self-publishing a bad rap. By utilizing professional editors and designers, I hope to counter self-publishing's poor reputation.</p>
<p>To me, self-publishing and the steampunk genre go hand-in-hand. The steampunk community is full of original artists and makers, cosplayers, writers, readers, and fans with a deeply-embedded do-it-yourself attitude, and a focus on supporting others in the community. It's this attitude that solidified my decision to self-publish.<br/></p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
</div><div>Writing and publishing a novel is hard work, but I'm so close to the finish line! I've completed what many people consider the hard part: actually writing the story. Now it's a matter of cleaning it up, and presenting it to the world in a professional manner.<br/><br/>If I am unable to make my funding goal, <i>Grigory's Gadget</i> will not cease to exist. However, the process will be more difficult, and will take considerably longer as I try to save up enough money for the professional services. <br/>

  Why Self-Publish?
 The world of publishing is changing, with self-publishing becoming more-and-more common. This puts all of the power and all of the rights into the author's hands, giving them more freedom to tell the story they need to tell.
The downside of this trend is that many writers upload their stories without proper editing and design, which in turn gives self-publishing a bad rap. By utilizing professional editors and designers, I hope to counter self-publishing's poor reputation.
To me, self-publishing and the steampunk genre go hand-in-hand. The steampunk community is full of original artists and makers, cosplayers, writers, readers, and fans with a deeply-embedded do-it-yourself attitude, and a focus on supporting others in the community. It's this attitude that solidified my decision to self-publish.
Risks & Challenges
Writing and publishing a novel is hard work, but I'm so close to the finish line! I've completed what many people consider the hard part: actually writing the story. Now it's a matter of cleaning it up, and presenting it to the world in a professional manner.If I am unable to make my funding goal, Grigory's Gadget will not cease to exist. However, the process will be more difficult, and will take considerably longer as I try to save up enough money for the professional services.

magazine editor and a podcast host (“The Art &amp; Business of Writing” on
iTunes &amp; Stitcher). I wrote “Art &amp; Business of Writing: A Practical
Guide to the Writing Life” to help writers of all levels solve these and other problems. </p>
<h3><br/></h3><h3>My
Story</h3>
<p>Frustration brought me back to writing.</p>
<p>As I listened to “The Power of Focus” by Anthony Robbins, I
decided to take him up on testing the power of something transformational. My
first action: I reread the beginning of “The Artist's Way” by Julia
Cameron and committed to rekindling my writing career. Six years had passed
since my last full-time writing job and I hadn’t written much in that span. It
was time.</p>
<p>I started by journaling — three pages of longhand,
stream-of-consciousness writing — for 100 days. My daily affirmation, “You are
a good writer,” went from something I half-heartedly scribbled in the notebook
to words I came to believe and embrace. Within 75 days, the idea for a blog
showed up.</p>
<p>I launched my blog, Pedestrian's Guide to Fredericksburg,
and set out to write profiles about the arts, businesses and culture of
Fredericksburg, Virginia, where I lived at the time. Not long after
launching the blog, I received an email from <i>Fredericksburg Parent &amp; Family</i>, a regional parenting magazine.
They saw my blog and wanted to find a way to collaborate. We had a few
conversations, but nothing materialized. I stayed in contact with the company’s
director of operations and that relationship eventually paid off months later
when she called to see if I knew anyone who would be interested in their
part-time editor position. I told her that I would be interested and then was
interviewed and offered the job.</p>
<p>I was writing professionally again and having fun. In that
first year, I interviewed celebrity chef Rachael Ray, HGTV host Sabrina Soto, Pretty
Little Liars star Keegan Allen, and Lifetime TVs Deborah Tillman — known as
America’s Supernanny. A year later, I became the managing editor at a larger
magazine called <i>The Health Journal</i> where
I now serve as the magazine’s editor-in-chief. </p>

<p>Hello there! Ask anyone about their history or national education lessons and they will recount how Mrs. Tan had the uncanny ability to hypnotise the whole class out of insomnia. Do you remember your history textbooks? (I bet not!)</p>
<p>Over the course of this year, I was inspired to work on a series of books that will deal with issues pertinent to our burdened society. The first book adopts a fun outlook on Singapore and important Singaporean themes to children. These themes are issues that are close to my heart and I believe, yours too. ​The subsequent books will revolve around a cute Pandan leaf protagonist ""Dan"" but will touch on educational themes such as Family Violence, Mental Illness, Bullying, Body Image and other issues.</p>
<p>My illustrator Joycelyn and I have spent many sleepless nights planning this book, with great anticipation that this new line of books will meaningfully educate young minds on these important topics. With great knowledge, comes power! I believe that equipping our children with insightful perspectives will help them make informed decisions and guide them in doing the right thing during tough times.</p>
<p>The protagonist and characters in this proposed book are key ingredients found in many of the local dishes that we love. The ingredients Pandan, Coconut, Wu Xiang Fen, Onion and Sugar are unique and frequently used in this region.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The Impact</h3>
<p>We chose to use the first book to tell the Singapore story because there is a severe dearth of children’s storybooks that teaches about Singapore’s independence, self-reliance and diversity. This story aims to raise awareness on how we managed to foster a sense of belonging to this young nation despite limited resources, within a short span of time. We hope for families to spend more time together reading this story.</p>

The amount you donate, no matter the sum, will go a long way for Singaporeans and will definitely help to make this book a quality and memorable publication.</span></p>
<p>70% of this money raised will go towards printing a good quality hard cover book, with full colour art paper. It will also help us fund marketing, promotion and distribution costs. This will allow us to get the story out to more people.

About the book
The Food that Makes Us features:

10 essays with photographs exploring the stories behind home cooks and their specialty dishes, including Hainanese chicken rice, achar, popiah, tuak, pork belly confit, fish stew in bamboo by the native Semelai tribe, putu mayam and so on
10 recipes, with step-by-step pictures as guide
10 full-page artistic interpretations of each story by Malaysian illustrator Tuan Nini
Full-colour pages


The project was published as a series called ‘Cooking People’ in a Malaysian tablet magazine, The B-Side, from August 2013 to May 2014. Now that the magazine has ceased operation, the authors hope to keep the stories, recipes and spirit of the cooks alive by compiling them into this book.

My story, The Walking School Bus, was inspired by a variety of experiences which shaped our characters’ journey.
Our protagonists, a 7-year-old boy, and girl, live in rural South Africa.
Their mothers work long days as caretakers and their fathers have both been forced to work further north in the mining camps. Consequently, the children are unable to attend school which is an 8-km walk from their village. Their mothers will not let them walk alone due to dangers along the way.As a result, they spend their days gathering water, exploring, and looking for “treasures,” such as interesting rocks and animals.One day, they find an object that they had never seen before, a shiny treasure.Upon closer inspection and after asking their mothers, they discover that this object is a miniature school bus.The children immediately understand that if they possessed a real school bus, then they too would be able to attend school and receive an education.The following weeks are spent trying to build the real school bus out of many different materials.However, once the children understand that the task is too great, their approach to the problem changes. They tap into the power of their imagination and harness it to make their dream of attending school a reality.They form a group called the “walking school bus,” whereby children walk together in large numbers and mimic the shape –and protection– of a school bus.Ultimately, their movement gains traction and spreads across South Africa, empowering education despite immense adversity.

Inspiration behind the story: 4 years ago on a trip back to Johannesburg South Africa as well as Uganda, I became increasingly aware of how debilitating economic policies continued to negatively impact the population.  I saw how many lack basic access to fundamental human rights, namely, education – the same education too frequently taken for granted.Frustrated with my inability to change the past, and with hopes to facilitate a brighter future, I wrote The Walking School Bus. The book will help raise funds to ensure access to education for communities where I currently work. Learn more at:  thewalkingschoolbus.com. What this book aims to achieve: While this book aims to achieve a variety of goals, a top priority is to impress the same importance of education that our protagonists feel onto its readers. It aims to show the lengths people will travel to attain an education.Proceeds from the sales of each and every book will help generate the funds necessary to provide buses and educational material to villages in need. In this regard, the school bus is metaphoric and represents access. Access to education, access to scholastic material, access to nutrition – a prerequisite for education.Interviews with community members associated with the project:Head Teacher Enosh and I discuss the need for transportation infrastructure and the positive effects associated with a school bus. https://youtu.be/TVcYo3mdvYIHead Master Seth and I discuss the history of interfaith education in Uganda as well as how the students access education. https://youtu.be/1h22SGclcNgHow you can help:
Please support The Walking School Bus initiative by purchasing a book, other promotional material, or by making a donation today.
What is the dream goal? To sell 500 hardcover books that would fund the purchase of one school bus!                                           Product DescriptionThe Walking School Bus Book September 1st, 2016 (Preorder your copy now). StickersPenBookmarkOriginal PhotographsShopping toteTWSB: Change BoxNotebook:1  Notebook:2  Notebook:3 Water bottleFlip FlopsSizingGraphic Hat: 1Graphic Hat: 2Graphic Hat: 3Graphic TGraphic Long SleeveWatch: Give Back TimeThanks For Reading!",27.0,0,"1 Campaign

<br/><h3>Short Story</h3> <p>I want to publish my new book ""How To Make A Living By Working For Free.""</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Slightly Longer Story</h3>
<p>Hi... my name is Simon. Welcome to my crowdfunding project.</p>
<p>For the past 6 years I've worked in social media. In short this means I write jokes and make images for the internet. The longer story is I build communities through excellent free content that attracts an audience for brands.</p>
<p>For the last 5 years I've been a gigging comedian slowly building a fan base online through free content. I've used the knowledge and skills I've built in my day job to make communities around the different channels I operate in online.</p>
<p>This book explains everything I've learned from obsessively reading, learning and trying to work out how relationships build online, how to build a community around what you do as an artist to find, nurture and grow your community on and offline.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>What I need from this crowdfunding it pretty simple... money to get the first print run of the book off the ground / get the digital book finalised and ready to go on sale on Amazon.</p>
<p>My target amount is the absolute minimum that I would need to get the book ready for the public. Anything above that would be sales / profit. </p>
<p>I've set up some awesome rewards for early backers, but if there's something you want which isn't available, please email me (<a href=""mailto://simon.m.caine@gmail.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">simon.m.caine@gmail.com</a>) and I'll try to make it available for you.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Here's a synopsis of the book - </h3> <p>The book is a how-to guide for artists to create their own online community for their work and how that community can support the artist to become sustainable in every way.<br/><br/>The book takes a critical and in-depth look at the media's perception of ""free content"" vs the reality of what the general public see it as.<br/><br/>If you're an artist in the modern age who wants a sustainable audience you're no longer just an artist, you're a community leader.<br/></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Here's a breakdown of all the chapters - </h3> <p></p>
<p><b>Chapter 1: How to make money out of your creativity?</b></p>
<p>From the Middle Ages to Renaissance Europe to the current day. I give you a brief history of how artists made money to continue creating what they do best.</p>
<p><b>Chapter 2: Aims</b></p>
<p>What do you want to achieve? You can’t achieve an aim without having a final goal in mind. Here’s where you need to be honest with yourself about what you want so you can focus on your mind on how you’re going to get it.</p>
<p><b>Chapter 3: Where are you at the moment?</b></p>
<p>You could be below the radar or have a growing fan base. You could even have a large fan base but not now how to make money from it. This is the chapter where we look at where you are in relation to your goal and how you can realistically achieve it using The Curve.</p>
<p><b>Chapter 4: How do you build and maintain an audience?</b></p>
<p>What do you need in order to attract an audience? And more importantly, what do you need to do to maintain it. In this chapter we look at how relationships between artists and fans develops online and start to reframe the idea of “Free” as a good thing.</p>
<p><b>Chapter 5: How many fans do you really need?</b></p>
<p>Do you really need a million fans to be profitable? Probably not. The number is probably closer to 1,000. In this chapter we’ll look at how you find your True Fans and ask them (nicely) to support you.</p>
<p><b>Chapter 6: Why you shouldn’t aim for the mainstream</b></p>
<p>In this chapter we’ll look at why “breaking the mould” or doing something unique is a great thing and you shouldn’t fear it. The mainstream is dying and niche interest communities are growing as we’ll see in the Long Tail Theory. By being specific in what you do you stand the greatest chance of attracting a loyal fan base.</p>
<p><b>Chapter 7: How can you be unique in your field?</b></p>
<p>Now that we’ve established why being unique is a good thing, we’ll need to work out what’s unique about you and why that’s a really good and exciting thing. Oh they’ll be Purple Cows.</p>
<p><b>Chapter 8: Why advertising undervalues content.</b></p>
<p>Can you live off internet adverts? Probably not. (Sorry to burst your bubble). Advertising can make you a bit of cash, but in this chapter we’ll look into why that cash is short term, can lose you fans and ultimately devalues what you’re trying to do.</p>
<p><b>Chapter 9: Why you have to give stuff away for free?</b></p>
<p>In this chapter we’re going to look into the main reasons why some artists have decided to give away their content for free and why people will pay for art that they can get for free.</p>
<p><b>Chapter 10: Why you have to give stuff away?</b></p>
<p>Why people will and won’t pay for free content is down to your connection with them. In this chapter we’re going to look at why free content is actually the first step in building a connection with a potential True Fan.</p>
<p><b>Chapter 11: How to think like a fan.</b></p>
<p>Artists often forget that they’re fans of someone else - usually the person who got them interested in the thing they’re doing / making. Remembering how excited you are about another artist's work helps you get in the mindset of your fans which is important when it comes to building a relationship with them.</p>
<p><b>Chapter 12: Pick yourself</b></p>
<p>Why you should be independent and not wait to make the thing you’ve always wanted. If it’s good enough and finds a large enough audience the mainstream industry will beat a path to your door - by which time, you might not even need them.</p>
<p><b>Chapter 13: Why paywalls are the worst thing online.</b></p>
<p>Given that we established in Chapter 10 that giving away content is actually the first step in building a relationship, we look at paywalls and why these are not going to help you to continue to attract a wider and wider audience.</p>
<p><b>Chapter 14: Vanity Figures.</b></p>
<p>Numbers are fun online. From your Follower count on Twitter to your Fans on Facebook, it’s easy to forget these numbers are people. They might make you feel good when they’re going up, but they’re vanity metrics and should be taken with a pinch of salt. What numbers matter and what numbers make us feel good aren’t always the same thing.</p>
<p><b>Chapter 15: A Quick Guide to Crowdfunding.</b></p>
<p>In this chapter we’ll deep dive into several methods of crowdfunding your art from the one-off method to the on-going financial support of your fans which can be so critical for artists.</p>
<p><b>Chapter 16: First Steps / Devising Own Targets.</b></p>
<p>Where do I go from here?</p>
<p>Now that you’ve learned everything I have to offer I will give you some final tips specific to your artistic field and also go into deep detail on what you can do to cultivate your community.</p>

<h3>I LOVE the sound of this book, but I'd like to preview it first...</h3>
<p>Well you're in luck my friend. <a href=""http://simoncaine.co.uk/Mumbles.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">I've put a DRM-free PDF of the first few chapters which you can download / read here</a>. </p>

<div>
<h3>Risks etc...</h3>Of course with any project like this there's a certain amount of risk involved. But the big one is that I don't make the funding. Now, I've borrowed some money to get the product finished which means it's basically ready to go. The worse situation will be I make a massive loss on this. <br/>
</div>
<div>I am asking you to take a bit of a risk on me by buying this book, but if you've read this far down the page I hope you don't think I'm some sort of online scam artists - if I was, there would be much easier ways for me to try and take your money. </div>

Risks etc...Of course with any project like this there's a certain amount of risk involved. But the big one is that I don't make the funding. Now, I've borrowed some money to get the product finished which means it's basically ready to go. The worse situation will be I make a massive loss on this. 

I am asking you to take a bit of a risk on me by buying this book, but if you've read this far down the page I hope you don't think I'm some sort of online scam artists - if I was, there would be much easier ways for me to try and take your money. 
If you have any concerns or issues which I've not covered here, please do not hesitate to email me. I promise no question is stupid or too petty. I'll be happy to answer anything. Here's my personal email - simon.m.caine@gmail.com or you can tweet me (@thismademecool) if you can fit it into 140 characters.",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>musings of a phoenix</h3>
<p>Hello all the lovely people in the world who come upon this,</p>
<p>My name is Steph, also known as ~<a href=""https://www.themysticdreamer.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">the mystic dreamer</a>~ and Goji. I have been working hard on a poetry book since 2017, and have written over 100 poems for it. And for the past year, I've been refining and also collaborating with my healer artist friend Ash B on it. We are both women based in the Bay Area.</p>
<p>The book will be titled <i><strong>""musings of a phoenix""</strong></i>. It will be copies of my handwritten poems, collaged with Ash's hand linedrawn artistry. </p>
<p><strong>We would like to raise funds in order to publish it and start to spread it to our loved ones, friends and family who might be in need of healing poetry and art.</strong></p>
<p>The book has sections called ""present"", ""lost"", ""heart"", ""universe"", ""dreams"", and ""growth"" and opens with a poem called Rebirth.</p>
<p><strong>We would also like to continue supporting other hard-working people, </strong>so 15% of our earnings will be donated to a charity, to be carefully and deliberately researched later (probably one that lies at the cross section of climate x youth)</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi loves! We're marginsbox. We began in January 2019 with the intent of shaking up the subscription book box game.

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Let's face it - publishing is a primarily white industry producing products with primarily white authors writing primarily white characters. Our goal is to expand the horizons of people who may not normally pick up certain books by marginalized authors and have them fall in love. We want to give marginalized kids a chance to see themselves reflected on the page and behind the pen. We want to show that it's possible to have a successful subscription box--a successful career in publishing--without leaving marginalized voices out of the conversation. Otherwise, things will remain the way they are indefinitely.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest risk we face is not reaching our goal. We will <i>only</i> be able to fulfill the quiltbag box campaign prototype if we fully fund, so if we fall short, we have backup plans in store that depend upon how close we get, and we'll let everyone know ASAP if there's a change. But we're optimists around these parts, and we know you'll all come together to get us to the goal!</p>

<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Jackson and Tess are trapped in a dangerous game. The only way out is to navigate through the game levels.

<p>The book was assessed during the editing process as; <i>‘A young adult novel about children who mysteriously get stuck in a video game and have to navigate their way out, while fulfilling a mission that has real-world consequences'</i> and as <i>'an imaginative and engaging story for young readers offering a new generation a Jumanji­-style quest story. This book addresses important environmental issues and is led by characters that will resonate with young audiences.'</i></p>
<p>This book is ideal for <strong>teens</strong> however it has been reviewed by multiple readers between 9 and adult, all found the book intriguing, captivating and are keen for a sequel. Please look at the reviews below.    </p>

<h3><strong>The CAMPAIGN  </strong></h3>
<p>Hello everyone. Thanks for stopping by to check out my campaign to self-publish my <strong>Eco Fiction</strong> Adventure Fantasy book that has been written to instill a strong awareness of the need to maintain the balance of nature, honour indigenous wisdom and promote a sense of hope that working together can bring about change.  </p>
<h3><strong>ABOUT ME</strong></h3>
<p>As mentioned, in the video, I am Tricia Delaney from Australia. I am a parent and environmentalist. I work as a palliative care social worker in Melbourne. I grew up in rural Australia on the Victorian, New South Wales border on the banks of the Murray River. My love for the river, the trees, the wide-open skies and the wildlife has remained an integral part of my being. Circumstances led me to living in the city for study and work and eventually raising my children there. Throughout their childhood we regularly sought out natural places to explore and immerse ourselves in. Over the years it became glaringly apparent that both the environment and my children's future were both at risk. As a working single parent, I wondered what could I possibly do.</p>
<p>..... And so, 13 years ago, I decided to write a book. A book that I couldn't find for my children. A fantasy adventure book that young people would really enjoy reading with important environmental values subtly weaving throughout the story. </p>
<p>I am pleased to say, I have FINALLY FINISHED writing the book. </p>
<p><strong>PUBLISHING</strong></p>
<p>I was encouraged to have it submitted to a traditional publisher and advised that it could have story related merchandise.      </p>
<h3><strong>STOP!!   </strong></h3>
<p>I could not risk the environmental message being changed. I certainly didn't want to have plastic merchandise created in my name.  I also didn't want to wait 2-3 years for this book to be in the hands of our young readers. So, I decided to self-publish and invite like minded parents, grandparents and of course young readers to get on board.  So far it has been professionally edited and the cover illustrated. </p>
<p>With your help, readers will have access to inspiring Eco fiction literature, that is informative, exciting, engaging and inspires hope.  Please join me in making this book available to our young readers. </p>
<h3><strong>CAMPAIGN INFO - What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>

<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
</div><div>
<p>When I started writing this book, I had no idea how quickly environmental issues would accelerate in our lives. So many young people out marching, getting involved in environmental projects. It is so timely that our young people are supported in ways that motivate and inspire. Books have always provided this for me. </p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Basically, I am well on the way with the organisation  required to self publish a book. The book has been edited and the cover illustrated. All that remains is that my publisher receive the funds to proceed and complete the project. The only risk really is a delay for a few months if I don't reach my funding goal by the end of the campaign. This just means I will have to raise funds myself by working an additional job for perhaps 6 months which I have done before to achieve my goals.   </p>
<h3><strong>SURPASSING THE GOAL   </strong></h3>

<p><strong>Claudia 15  - </strong><i>‘I really enjoyed this story. It was very different to any other books I have read before. As I was reading it, I sort of imagined it as a movie because of all the scenery and the action. I liked all the characters because they all had different personalities. and over all, I just liked the creativity of the book.’</i></p>
<p><strong>Jared 13   - </strong><i>‘Good story line.’</i></p>
<p><strong>Callum 11   - </strong><i>‘Highly interesting, fun to read. The whole book made sense. My favourite character was Tess. I’d definitely read a sequal. 9/10 points!’</i></p>
<p><strong>Grace 13 -</strong><i>‘I really enjoyed this story. My favourite characters were Hadwyn, Kastytis or Queen Kulibari, they’re all super helpful and awesome characters. Plus, turtles are super cool. I would definitely read a sequel. I think people of all ages would enjoy this amazing story.’ </i></p>
<p><strong> Isaiah 12  -</strong><i>‘Quite a good book. I’m actually quite impressed all the paragraphs make sense. I suggest you write more books as you seem like a good author. The whole book works well together. Can’t wait for the next book. I hope you write about Mackenzie’s father.’ </i></p>
<p><strong>Anna 9 - </strong>‘<i>I love all the twists and turns in the book. There’s not a moment where it’s not exciting or interesting. Throughout the book, going through the different levels, it’s really detailed and I can picture every scene in my head. A wonderful story that everyone will enjoy.’</i></p>
<p><strong>Jess 15 -</strong><i>‘The theme of having to learn to work together in a suck it up type of way was realistic. I liked the way things were described leaving enough mystery for your mind to create pictures.’</i></p>
<p><strong>Jade (adult)  - </strong>‘<i>A dream inspiring action-packed novel. Calling anyone of all ages to learn, discover, to aid and to enjoy this intriguing planet of ours.

By the end of this book I promise you'll be wanting a piece of amber of your own!’</i></p>
<p><strong>Elle (adult) - </strong><i>How can you do justice to a great book in just 3 sentences?  The plot of the story immersed me in a fiction pool full of wonder and imagination. I like how there are learning curves and giving importance about our relationships with friends, family, and our environment.  Parts of this experience may have been told before but never with such freshness, creativity, and passion which made me hook onto its every word. It’s a very versatile book because it’s not just for the younger generation but also for people who want to be taken back to their childhood memories but with a taste of the modern world. This is Tricia’s first book, but she has complete control of her story and her style. I can’t wait for it to become a motion picture and reach greater heights!</i></p>

Can’t wait to find out what happens in the sequel!”</i> </p>
<p> <strong>Bron (adult)</strong> <i>This is not my usual genre so I was surprised when I became so engrossed with the story. I found the characters totally engaging and found it hard to put the book down.

Jared 13   - ‘Good story line.’
Callum 11   - ‘Highly interesting, fun to read. The whole book made sense. My favourite character was Tess. I’d definitely read a sequal. 9/10 points!’
Grace 13 -‘I really enjoyed this story. My favourite characters were Hadwyn, Kastytis or Queen Kulibari, they’re all super helpful and awesome characters. Plus, turtles are super cool. I would definitely read a sequel. I think people of all ages would enjoy this amazing story.’ 
 Isaiah 12  -‘Quite a good book. I’m actually quite impressed all the paragraphs make sense. I suggest you write more books as you seem like a good author. The whole book works well together. Can’t wait for the next book. I hope you write about Mackenzie’s father.’ 
Anna 9 - ‘I love all the twists and turns in the book. There’s not a moment where it’s not exciting or interesting. Throughout the book, going through the different levels, it’s really detailed and I can picture every scene in my head. A wonderful story that everyone will enjoy.’
Jess 15 -‘The theme of having to learn to work together in a suck it up type of way was realistic. I liked the way things were described leaving enough mystery for your mind to create pictures.’
Jade (adult)  - ‘A dream inspiring action-packed novel. Calling anyone of all ages to learn, discover, to aid and to enjoy this intriguing planet of ours. These beautiful teachings are cleverly disguised within pages of friendship, travel, magic, technology and ever-growing characters you will never want to let go of. By the end of this book I promise you'll be wanting a piece of amber of your own!’
Elle (adult) - How can you do justice to a great book in just 3 sentences?  The plot of the story immersed me in a fiction pool full of wonder and imagination. I like how there are learning curves and giving importance about our relationships with friends, family, and our environment.  Parts of this experience may have been told before but never with such freshness, creativity, and passion which made me hook onto its every word. It’s a very versatile book because it’s not just for the younger generation but also for people who want to be taken back to their childhood memories but with a taste of the modern world. This is Tricia’s first book, but she has complete control of her story and her style. I can’t wait for it to become a motion picture and reach greater heights!
Josh (adult) -‘The book provides an opportunity for readers to reconnect with legends of the past.’
Kate (adult) - ‘What a beautiful read. I loved losing myself in this magical land. A real gem, with an important message.’
Merrin (adult) “This book engages right from the start and keeps us turning pages till the end. I love the way she has made this book about our impact on our environment through the different elements & characters that the author introduces. It is exciting, interesting and very relatable. Can’t wait to find out what happens in the sequel!” 
 Bron (adult) This is not my usual genre so I was surprised when I became so engrossed with the story. I found the characters totally engaging and found it hard to put the book down. The environmental message was strong throughout the story and the writing invoked images that I clearly visualise as if a movie was occurring before me.

<h2><strong>So, how does this campaign work?</strong></h2>
<p>Most of you are pre-ordering the 2020 <strong>2nd edition</strong> of <i>Growing Food God’s Way</i> when you contribute (order a perk) during this <strong>21-day</strong> crowdfunding campaign, After the book gets printed and the audiobook recorded, it will eventually be available via Amazon, but we want to really work better with <u>indie booksellers</u> this time. That presumes this campaign is successful. Lord willing, with your participation, it will be!</p>
<p>The book is in full color, (over 80 photos) and <strong>retails at $19.99</strong> for a single copy (plus shipping), but when you pre-order a book by February 14th, you get a <strong>earlybird discount ($17.99)</strong>.</p>
<p>Many of you will want to reserve more than one copy; usually to give as gifts, so there are bundles available: <strong>2, 5, 10, 50, even 100</strong>. The more copies you buy, the bigger savings you receive in return. You bless us (by getting more copies out to friends,  libraries, patient waiting rooms, beauty salons), and we want to bless you back!</p>
<p>The goal of this campaign is to pre-sell enough books to:<br/>a) finish the 2nd edition pre-press events,<br/>b) <strong>get it printed</strong> and…<br/>c) shipped (we’re talking between <strong>$13,000 and $20,000</strong> dollars worth of orders).<br/>In addition, the <strong>audiobook</strong> will start from scratch and we will need to arrange for studio time, get a sound engineer, and spend hours recording, followed by days of post-production, mixing and such. Providing an audiobook (for the 1st time) will be a real game-changer!</p>
<p>The campaign runs for <strong>20 days</strong>, and the books themselves will take 6-8 weeks to print. We expect them to start shipping sometime in<strong> March/early April</strong>. The goal is to have the audiobooks shipped by May.</p>
<h2><strong>Challenges</strong></h2>
<p>We will not go into debt to pay for printing costs. The first two printings were very small runs because we only printed what we had the money for.<br/>SPOILER ALERT – <i>Paul made a covenant with God to never go in debt again</i>. So, in deference to that, it would be hypocritical to finance the book printing, but fulfilling pre-orders is not going into debt, it is simply an extended exchange of goods.<br/><br/>The biggest challenge in doing all this comes from reaching the minimum number of orders necessary to make this cost effective. My goal is <strong>1000+ copies</strong> of the book going out to Perks, plus the other Perks,</p>
<p>If we don't reach that minimum threshold, the book can't be printed economically, but we serve a mighty Creator, so we are trusting God to exceed this threshold. By the way, when I say “we,” I mean the Devine family and my Indiegogo partners like Thatnub and Nick; not just Paul and me. He is very supportive and looks forward to the 2nd edition as a broader tool to share his <strong>timeless testimonies</strong> and God-given/human-experienced wisdom.</p>
<p>Plus, there are the typical challenges that come along with printing and shipping anything, but we’re dedicated to getting this all out in a timely manner, and I'm always able to be reached to hear any concerns or problems you encounter in this vast (but cool) process.</p>

<p>We really want to hit our minimum. The potential for this book is even greater than the 1st edition.

And speaking of Thatnub ( a premier YouTube prepper dude), he has graciously provided a ONE-OF-A-KIND perk for ambitious people to claim: a <strong>2016 video tour</strong> of Paul’s place that was never published on YouTube! That means it is your semi-PRIVATE screening of this tour compared to the 39,000+ subscribers who usually watch the tours! We call it Promoter, because YOU OWN IT and are free to show it (promote it) to your friends, but NOT to publish on social media or, say, your own website. I previewed this <strong>3-hour, 30-minute video</strong> and I can truly say it is the best tour (of many) I have personally attended or viewed online. We are offering only <strong>100 limited edition copies for $50</strong> each (on a thumb-drive; mailed to the address you give me).</p>
<p>Paul Gautschi and I have formed a wonderful dialogue and invested many prayers into this book and audio project, I am really excited to finally be able to get this new edition out via Indiegogo again. It's been a long time since we have been able to offer a tangible book to hold in your hands to: underline, highlight Paul’s wisdom, or dog-ear corners – to come back to another time…or to give as a gift!</p>

I live in Seminole, Oklahoma, moving back home after being able to live and work around the United States for 15 years working for the Air Force.  I wrote Milo in the Middle 25 years ago when I was 14 years old.  It’s hard to find good mentors, but I found a truly special person three years ago when this special person became my boss. During a performance feedback session with me before his retirement, he said “you should write a book”.  I told him I had written one but never tried to get it published. He went on to say that his wish for retirement was for me to try to get my book published.  </p><p>His confidence in me empowered me to start taking the steps to get Milo in the Middle published.

<h3>About: #LENNY.</h3>
<p>Hello,</p>
<ul>
<li>My name is <strong>Bradley Galimore</strong>. I am an artist and the writer of the online poetry column ""<strong>LENNY</strong>"".</li>
<li>
<strong>LENNY</strong> started off as a collection of poems, released weekly on a poetry blog. The narrative pieces tell the story of meeting someone, dating and forming a real connection from the viewpoint of a character in their 30's. Each season (chapter) is written as episodes (poems) that tell the story. I am a huge fan of stories told from differing perspectives. For <strong>LENNY</strong>, I wanted to have characters who had multiple points of view and discussed them poetically. <ul>
<li>
<u>Season 1</u>: We meet Lenny and find out his approach to handling life/relationships. He introduces his partner, gives us a little back story and starts to discuss his experience of opening up to someone new.</li>
<li>
<u>Season 2</u>: Deeper discussions are had using the late night and early morning hours as the setting. Questions about self worth, reflections on decisions and viewpoints on life shape how the story moves forward.</li>
<li>
<u><strong>Season 3</strong></u>: Alternate lives or alternate realities? See how things unfold in the next season of the #LENNY!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Currently, Seasons 1 and 2 can be read <a href=""https://thepoetryquestion.com/category/lenny/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>. (<u><strong>Season 3</strong></u> will be available August 2021)</li>

<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<p><i>Hidden Heroes</i></p>
<p>My name is Udit Dave, and I am the author of <i>Hidden Heroes.  </i>I wrote this book because I love sports and am fascinated by medicine, and I wanted to explore the intersection of these topics and the role medicine plays in sports.</p>
<p>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover how deeply medicine and sports are intertwined and how physicians truly are the hidden heroes in sports.  In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for sports and medicine in you.</p>
<p>In this book, you'll learn about how athletes' medical teams helped them elongate or save their careers, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>How LeBron James' medical team has helped him be one of the most durable athletes of all time</li>
<li>How doctors enabled Steph Curry to transform from an undersized, injury-prone guard to the greatest shooter of all time </li>
<li>How Dr. James Andrews helped Drew Brees break the NFL passing record when he was unlikely to ever step foot on a football field again</li>
</ul>
<p>You will love this book if you can't get enough of your favorite sports and are interested in the medicine that makes them so amazing.</p>

<p>Part 3 explores the remarkable ways doctors have helped everyday athletes get back to doing what they love, whether it is getting back to Recreation League basketball or a Division I college sport.</p>

<p>This book will be published with New Degree Press.  I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book.  Money raised will go towards the following:</p>

<h3>About the Book</h3>
<p><i>“Don’t you know? Animals like you have no soul.”</i><br/><br/>Could God ever love a half-blood all of society looks upon with such fear and disdain? Jace once believed so, but when a tragic loss shatters the only peace he’s ever known, his faith crumbles as the nagging doubts he’s tried to put behind him descend on his grieving heart. With them come the haunting memories of the bloodstained past he longs to forget, but can never escape.<br/><br/>Taken from home at a young age and raised to serve the emperor, Kyrin Altair lives every day under a dangerous pretense of loyalty. After her unique observation skills and perfect memory place her into direct service to the emperor, Kyrin finds herself in further jeopardy as it becomes increasingly difficult to hide her belief in Elôm, the one true God.<br/><br/>Following the emperor’s declaration to enforce the worship of false gods under the penalty of death, many lives are endangered. But there are those willing to risk everything to take a stand and offer aid to the persecuted. With their lives traveling paths they never could have imagined, Jace and Kyrin must fight to overcome their own fears and conflicts with society as they become part of the resistance.</p>

“Don’t you know? Animals like you have no soul.”Could God ever love a half-blood all of society looks upon with such fear and disdain? Jace once believed so, but when a tragic loss shatters the only peace he’s ever known, his faith crumbles as the nagging doubts he’s tried to put behind him descend on his grieving heart. With them come the haunting memories of the bloodstained past he longs to forget, but can never escape.Taken from home at a young age and raised to serve the emperor, Kyrin Altair lives every day under a dangerous pretense of loyalty. After her unique observation skills and perfect memory place her into direct service to the emperor, Kyrin finds herself in further jeopardy as it becomes increasingly difficult to hide her belief in Elôm, the one true God.Following the emperor’s declaration to enforce the worship of false gods under the penalty of death, many lives are endangered. But there are those willing to risk everything to take a stand and offer aid to the persecuted. With their lives traveling paths they never could have imagined, Jace and Kyrin must fight to overcome their own fears and conflicts with society as they become part of the resistance.

<h3>A Fat-tastic Adventure!</h3>
<p>The story of a group of adventurers who bite off more than they can chew! Written by Nekiyha, it's an entirely original project. Set in a fantasy, anthropomorphic land where lots of things can happen. </p>
<p>Hi! Call me Neki. I've been writing in the weight gain community for several years now, and have been writing for most of my life. I've worked on original projects before, but have always been too shy to share them. I hope that this project will be a good way to change that fear.</p>
<p>The group is made of four friends: Brigette, Victor, Elias, and Alindra.  A tiger, panther, fox, and lizard. They've been working together for a long time, helping keep their homeland safe. When they get themselves an old, mysterious, artifact their world will <i>expand</i> like never before!</p>
<p>Any contributions, at whatever levels will be greatly appreciated</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I hope that the $600 (CAD) will allow me to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Publish this novel on some sort of platform, be it Amazon or somewhere else.</li>
<li>Allow me to commission a poster-esque piece of art from a good artist known in the community</li>
<li>People who donate $35 or more will receive copies of the book before it's released to the general public for sale.</li>
<li>Those who donate more will be able to get more perks! Like having original characters show up in the novel!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest thing that comes to mind now is the fact I don't have any one particular artist in mind, and if I don't get all the money I won't be able to commission someone. I'm hopeful though, that interest in this project will maybe catch an artist's attention.</p>
<p>As excited as I am about this project, it is going to be a full-length novel and that is intimidating. However, I have a solid outline and many ideas and I believe that will be enough.</p>

Sarah isn't who most people would envision as a victim. She is smart, highly educated, loved and supported by her family and has a successful career.  So how did it happen to her and why can’t she just walk away? The answers to those questions are far more complicated than most Americans realize. With nearly 20 women being attacked in their own homes every <strong>minute</strong> in the United States, abuse is happening in high end homes in the upper-class suburbs far more often than is talked about. The truth is, no one knows how prevalent domestic abuse is due to the fact victims often keep silent and stay with their abusive partner.  Some victims normalize or don't recognize the abuse. Acceptance and endurance become a way of life. Their day-to-day existence is akin to a civilian in a combat zone. The question in the book is, will Sarah recognize her situation and leave? What will happen to her if she does? Her abuser, like most every other abuser, won’t just vanish if she finds a way to escape his grasp. She faces life and death decisions that abused women are forced to make.</p><p>​<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">Since America declared the War on Drugs in the 1980’s, with “Just Say No,” drug prices have dropped, usage has gone up and new designer drugs have hit the market. Drugs aren’t just destroying the inner cities, they are ripping apart families of every walk of life. And so often with drug usage, sexual deviance and sociopathic behavior can follow. Made in America’s other main character, Asher, is left helpless, broke and with his family in tatters because of drug abuse. He tries desperately to navigate the system and put all his pieces together again, learning powerful lessons about himself and addiction as he does.

It was a calm and plain question, posed in that familiar Black on Black vernacular, tinted with an audible element of surprise; “<i>What you doin’ brotha?”</i> My answer came in the shape of a slug set fire by an elaborate mechanism.

The velocity of the gun blast twisted me 180 degrees—tearing through denim, flesh, and muscle. My lower leg spun loosely, like a helicopter blade held together by charred tendons and cracked bone. In one eighth of one second, a literal flash in time, my life was separated into two parts, before May 10<sup>th</sup>, 2007, and everything after.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1541003572/z3ksyqzr9tvuuorelzsr.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>I collapsed to the ground where I stood. The other four assailants, there were five altogether, kicked me in the stomach and ribs, searching for money, car keys or whatever they could grab. Their next move was debated while I lay next to them; “<i>You killing this nigga</i>??” was the question at hand. Driven by what must have been a natural instinct for survival, I guerilla rolled for several feet, escaping the assault radius and stopping in the middle of 24<sup>th</sup> St south in the heart of Birmingham’s South Town Projects.</p><p>Laying there bleeding, waiting for the shooter to run over and finish me off, I realized my cell phone was still in my jacket pocket. From inside the conspiring circle, someone shouted; <i>“Yo nigga, don’t call the police</i>!” But it was too late; the fuzz was on the way by then. I crawled out of the middle of the road, laid my head on the ground, and waited for the cavalry to arrive.</p><p>Oddly enough, as the first wave of pain burned through my leg to the top of my skull, I was overwhelmed by a genuine sense of gratitude. I was grateful the shooter chose to lower his gun and shoot me in the leg instead of my face, avoiding a murder charge and gifting me more days in the life of my son Omari Jazz Addae.</p><p>I was grateful my phone was still in my pocket to call the “<i>ambalampse</i>”, had that not been the case, I would’ve have bled out where I laid.</p><p>I was also grateful for my super fly, quarter top, Italian leather boots, bequeathed to me by my brother from another mother, musician and fashion guru Mikel Banks. Without them on, my leg might have been blown clean off below the shin, the shoelaces kept the pressure between my foot and ankle, sparing me a worst injury or possible amputation.</p><p>Although I'm writing this ten years after the fact, every discussion conjures up cathartic memories of survival, recovery, pain and rehabilitation. Soon after the assault, the support from friends and family, even strangers, confirmed my faith in human generosity, in spite of the mental complications caused by random gun violence.</p><p><strong><i>The Kindness of Others</i></strong> is not only the title of this book, but a truth I've accepted for the better part of the last decade. My diagnosed  post-traumatic stress disorder manifested in different ways. Some more dysfunctional traits introduced new self-destructive behavior, loss of impulse control, and as my therapist put it, financial “<i>magic think</i>”.</p><p>Before my injury, I took life for granted at times. A single parent, working poet and part-time teacher, I had no health insurance or safety net to speak of. After 3 major surgeries; a donor bone graft, a skin graft, and a rare procedure where parts of my calf muscle now cover my tibia bone, I depended on a wheelchair, a walker, crutches, a cane, Percocet’s, Hydrocodone, Oxycodone, Tramadol, and eventually human kindness helped get me back on my feet.</p><p>This book is inspired by a decade of gratitude for that kindness and the gift of life itself. My son Omari Jazz bares particular mention for his patience and maturity on the front line of my often-surreal road to recovery. Dutch philosopher Soren Kierkegaard stated, “Life can only be understood backwards; but must be lived forward”.</p><p>I deliver this in the tradition of Marvin Gaye’s “<i>Here My Dear</i>”, an olive branch and mea-culpa to the friendships I’ve strained. love I lost, and the struggle to be made whole. It’s not what happens in life but how we react to it that defines us.  If anything else, I hope to inspire optimism for the arc of human perseverance and faith in the <i>kindness of others.</i> As we face the world as it is today, keep in mind the words of Sufi poet Attar of Nishapur, <i>this too shall pass</i>.</p><p>Enjoy.</p><p> </p><p align=""center""> </p><p style=""margin-left:2.0in;""> </p><h2 style=""margin-left:2in;""><strong>              2007</strong></h2><p align=""center""> </p><p align=""right""> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Never mind. </i></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>The self is the least of it.</i></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Let our scars fall in love.</i></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>-</i>Galway Kinnell </p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><p><strong>From Memory’s Grace</strong></p><p>I was new.</p><p>Everything was new.</p><p>The smell; a fresh scent in May</p><p>Smiles told me things I’d come to understand.</p><p> </p><p>Nothing met my expectations, or showed them</p><p>To be anything less.</p><p> </p><p>They told me it was Magic.</p><p>A Magic city.<br/>My son in one hand</p><p>New love in the other,</p><p>I took in the frontier, prepared for the years.</p><p> </p><p>When I was packing for Alabama,</p><p>Folding t-shirts, laughing at pictures,</p><p>Shredding papers and the past.</p><p> </p><p>I was warned of the quicksand of history,</p><p>The weight of anger</p><p>Distrust and segregation,</p><p>Told I might not make it out alive.</p><p> </p><p>None of us make it out alive.</p><p> </p><p> Fearless,</p><p>Entering the brave parade,</p><p>Chest pressed against the unexpected.</p><p> </p><p>Not knowing</p><p>Just how much of</p><p>This New South</p><p>I would face.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><strong>Crossing Borders</strong></p><p> </p><p>On a walk across the Southside,</p><p>Fresh divorce, unemployed, a poet.</p><p>Every step washed in humid curiosity.</p><p>The importance of change</p><p>Leading the day.</p><p> </p><p>Across Highland avenue,</p><p>Near Bottega,</p><p>Down the hill and to the right,</p><p>I stop at the Garage.</p><p> </p><p>Everything had meaning then.</p><p>Broken statues in the bar courtyard,</p><p>Ruins of empires,</p><p>History and beer.</p><p>My poetry,</p><p>A declaration of war against invisible borders.</p><p> </p><p>I am not the <i>Nigger</i> you think I am</p><p>I am not the <i>Nigga</i> you think I am</p><p> </p><p>The rebel in me</p><p>The student told to say</p><p>the unsaid</p><p>Write</p><p>The unwritten</p><p>Live where no one’s living</p><p>Agree with little</p><p>short of feeling free.</p><p> </p><p>Under Vulcan’s eyes, I was tested</p><p>Crossing borders built on</p><p>Fear and old ways</p><p>Empty fences on both sides</p><p> </p><p>I am not the <i>Nigger</i> you think I am</p><p>I am not the <i>Nigga</i> you think I am</p><p> </p><p>Grateful, no one saw me</p><p>Coming to town.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p><strong>Happy Birthday Mothafuckaaah!!</strong></p><p> </p><p>It’s March 8<sup>th</sup>, 2007, my 38<sup>th</sup> birthday. In typical Piscean fashion, birthdays are holiest of holy days. Most of you <i>Hamburglars</i> remember <i>The B.A.M.A.’s</i>, (Birmingham Area Music Awards) sponsored by one of my favorite periodicals at the time, the <i>Birmingham Weekly</i>. The famed ceremony showcased Magic City’s local talent. A gala affair with red carpets, rented suits, little statues and live performances.</p><p>The irony of a transplant from New York getting nominated for a <i>BAMA</i> award aside, I was proud to be competing with local artists like Birmingham J and Thed Weller in the best Hip Hop/Rap category, little ole me, a poet.</p><p>Losing the B.A.M.A to Birmingham J came as no surprise. In 2007, his hit track “<i>Move Back</i>”, with the infectious hook “<i>back it on up like a U-Haul truck</i>”, was piping out of radios and clubs across the country, a no-brainer. My award came in a more meaningful moment when Birmingham impresarios Ona Watson and Marty Eagle—may his soul rest in peace—serenaded me on stage, leading a rousing rendition of “<i>Happy Birthday to you</i>” to a packed house in the theater of Birmingham’s Workplay. Founded by Alan Hunter, of MTV fame, the venue was eventually purchased by the Williams brothers, Tommy and Clark, who resurrected it into what it’s become today.</p><p>The icing on the cake came when my band performed a set of original music for the pumped up crowd. I was on cloud nine. The validation, acceptance and birthday love, it all made my head feel bigger than a helium balloon at the county fair, straight up, I felt like the motherfucking man.</p><p>Of course, all balloons lose air eventually, and the helium filling my head proved no exception. As I was leaving Workplay with my Mother and 12-year-old son in tow, I realized my car wasn’t parked where I’d left it. In the tradition of denial and the river in Egypt, I had a hard time accepting the truth, sending the offspring to further investigate the empty parking space.</p><p>At this time in life, my son Omari Jazz was developing an uncanny wit and sarcasm. He walked back over to where I was standing, confirmed the car was missing, and with a straight face tried to convince me he saw Birmingham J take off in it after winning his award.</p><p>Accepting my 1987 beige Jeep Cherokee hooptie, bought for $200, had been stolen on my birthday, was a bitter pill to swallow. Standing outside the venue, all angry and paranoid, I filled out a police report as the crowd, who only moments ago was singing my praise, is now staring suspiciously at my situation, all up in my Bisquick. Picking up on my distress, my friend Charity offered to take my family and I home. My good friend former Birmingham City Councilman Jonathan Austin came along for the ride.</p><p>Resigned to my situation and grateful for the kindness, we piled into Charity’s SUV and made our way toward Avondale, the neighborhood I lived in before it was redefined (gentrified) by craft beers and fusion Mexican-Sushi rolls. Minutes into our ride home, as we pulled up to a red light on 7<sup>th</sup> avenue and 23<sup>rd </sup>street on Birmingham’s south side, what else do we see but my stolen car, casually cruising down the road, a cigarette cocked to the side of the thief’s mouth, completely oblivious to having drove pass the car’s real owner.</p><p>To say all hell broke loose in the SUV is an understatement. My poor Mother, bless her heart, was quick to tell me to calm down and call the police. Omari, who hadn’t uttered a bad word since cursing me out at Busch Gardens in Florida when he was 4, let out a well articulated, “<i>What…the…fuck??</i>”</p><p>We made a sharp turn and pulled up behind my stolen jeep, following it without the knucklehead’s knowledge. In what sounded like the “<i>Power of Christ compels you</i>” chorus from <i>The Exorcist, </i>Jonathan kept saying “<i>I should have brought my damn pistol, shit, I should have brought my damn pistol</i>”, over and over again, like Marion Barry after DEA agents jumped out of the air vents. This, of course, sent my Mother, who had just moved to Birmingham a week before, into an unbridled panic, repeatedly asking him, <i>“You own a gun</i>?? <i>You own a gun</i>??”</p><p>For her part, our stealth detective driver Charity kept her eyes on the prize, never wavering from behind the bandit’s tail. Right when I was about to call the police on my 2007 flip phone, the casual kleptomaniac put the blinkers on, made a U-turn, and started heading in the other direction, straight toward us! Watching this Fat Albert looking mop head—clearly not Birmingham J—driving the car I needed to take Omari to school every morning sent me over the fucking top. In the blink of an eye I turned from mild mannered poet <i>Bruce Leroy Banner</i> into the peanut butter brown Hulk. I slung open the door of the SUV and jumped out.</p><p>My plan was some MacGyver shit. I was going to jump on the hood of the car, open the driver’s side door—since I knew it didn’t lock—grab the thief by the throat, and choke him to death while recovering my stolen property, pretty simple.  “If you want to make God laugh, tell him about your plans.” I’m not sure if God was laughing, but Omari damn near split his sides when I jumped out and my arm got stuck in the seat belt’s shoulder strap. Now, instead of sprawling across the hood like fucking Spider Man, I was gliding across the pavement, stuck behind the SUV door, skidding toward my stolen car. I’ll never forget the look of shock and awe on dudes face when we locked eyes and he realized the jig was up. He looked like he was screaming, <i>“Motherfucka, you mus’ be crazy!!”</i> behind his bulging eyeballs.      </p><p>When Charity hit the brakes, my arm came loose from the seat belt and I landed on my butt bone, bouncing down the road like an overdressed beach ball. The entire scene scared my poor Mother half to death. Omari just kept laughing like his favorite cartoon <i>Cat Dog</i> had just come on Nick at Nite.</p><p>Standing there, bruised ego, sore booty bone, and minor scratches, my car sped down the road and disappeared at the next turn. Having done my best—or at least my craziest—we drove home and dropped off the family. I changed into a <i>Wu-Tang Clan</i> black hoodie and a pair of shell-top black on white Adidas, getting ready for whatever. Back in the SUV, Charity and Jonathan talked me down from the ledge. Rather than search for my car, we decided to stop by <i>Amani Raha</i>, a nightclub in Birmingham’s Pepper Place district.</p><p>Amani Raha was owned by my friend Antonio Minnifield, cousin to ex-football star Terrell “T.O.” Owens. The place was a swank lounge for Birmingham’s Black, grown and sexy set. Walking into the venue, I immediately felt better when the DJ shouted me out; being the center of attention always gave me the fix I needed. At the bar, shots of tequila were lined up and we banged them down like Nomads drinking water in the desert. The night was finally taking a turn for the better. Word had spread about my car getting stolen, and my loss to Birmingham J at the B.A.M.A’s, so the drinks and sympathy flowed in abundance. Fuck it; it was my birthday after all, time to celebrate.</p><p>About an hour into the party, with bodies gyrating and sweating all over the place, I was invited to partake in the ceremonial “<i>Birthday Blunt</i>”.  Stepping outside to “<i>put it in the air</i>”, we walked out of the venue to a nearby street corner, only to realize we didn’t have the requisite lighter for the task at hand. I waved to Charity who was also outside and asked if she could solve our dilemma. With all the proper ingredients for the consecration in hand, no sooner than I lit the ritual herb stick, here comes my stolen car, the 1987 Jeep Cherokee, tearing around the corner and passing us in a cloud of dust. I couldn’t fucking believe it. My jaw dropped. As the shock wore off, Charity turned to me and let out a loud, “<i>HAPPY BIRTHDAY MOTHAFUCKAAAAH</i>!!” BAHAHAHA!!</p><p>I’ll tell you, we laughed harder than I had in a long time that night. Turns out, the thief was joy riding around the South Side before leaving my car stripped and abandoned near the “<i>Piggly Wiggly</i>,” a grocery store off Claremont Avenue in Birmingham. I found the damn thing three weeks later when an acquaintance spotted it in an apartment building’s parking lot, ironically, right underneath a NO PARKING ANYTIME sign.</p><p>The year 2007 had shot its first salvo across the bow of my life’s ship. Although I was grateful to have the jeep a friend nicknamed “<i>Christine” </i>back, I could never have predicted the role it would play in the life-changing episode to come a few months later.</p><p> </p></div>","My name is Sharrif SimmonsI'm currently an artist in residency at the Open Ateliers program in Zuidoost (Southeast) Amsterdam.Having cared for my mother over the course of the last year and a half, finding the time needed to write and share my poems and stories was far and few between.

He walked back over to where I was standing, confirmed the car was missing, and with a straight face tried to convince me he saw Birmingham J take off in it after winning his award.Accepting my 1987 beige Jeep Cherokee hooptie, bought for $200, had been stolen on my birthday, was a bitter pill to swallow. Standing outside the venue, all angry and paranoid, I filled out a police report as the crowd, who only moments ago was singing my praise, is now staring suspiciously at my situation, all up in my Bisquick. Picking up on my distress, my friend Charity offered to take my family and I home. My good friend former Birmingham City Councilman Jonathan Austin came along for the ride.Resigned to my situation and grateful for the kindness, we piled into Charity’s SUV and made our way toward Avondale, the neighborhood I lived in before it was redefined (gentrified) by craft beers and fusion Mexican-Sushi rolls. Minutes into our ride home, as we pulled up to a red light on 7th avenue and 23rd street on Birmingham’s south side, what else do we see but my stolen car, casually cruising down the road, a cigarette cocked to the side of the thief’s mouth, completely oblivious to having drove pass the car’s real owner.To say all hell broke loose in the SUV is an understatement. My poor Mother, bless her heart, was quick to tell me to calm down and call the police. Omari, who hadn’t uttered a bad word since cursing me out at Busch Gardens in Florida when he was 4, let out a well articulated, “What…the…fuck??”We made a sharp turn and pulled up behind my stolen jeep, following it without the knucklehead’s knowledge. In what sounded like the “Power of Christ compels you” chorus from The Exorcist, Jonathan kept saying “I should have brought my damn pistol, shit, I should have brought my damn pistol”, over and over again, like Marion Barry after DEA agents jumped out of the air vents. This, of course, sent my Mother, who had just moved to Birmingham a week before, into an unbridled panic, repeatedly asking him, “You own a gun?? You own a gun??”For her part, our stealth detective driver Charity kept her eyes on the prize, never wavering from behind the bandit’s tail. Right when I was about to call the police on my 2007 flip phone, the casual kleptomaniac put the blinkers on, made a U-turn, and started heading in the other direction, straight toward us! Watching this Fat Albert looking mop head—clearly not Birmingham J—driving the car I needed to take Omari to school every morning sent me over the fucking top. In the blink of an eye I turned from mild mannered poet Bruce Leroy Banner into the peanut butter brown Hulk. I slung open the door of the SUV and jumped out.My plan was some MacGyver shit. I was going to jump on the hood of the car, open the driver’s side door—since I knew it didn’t lock—grab the thief by the throat, and choke him to death while recovering my stolen property, pretty simple.  “If you want to make God laugh, tell him about your plans.” I’m not sure if God was laughing, but Omari damn near split his sides when I jumped out and my arm got stuck in the seat belt’s shoulder strap. Now, instead of sprawling across the hood like fucking Spider Man, I was gliding across the pavement, stuck behind the SUV door, skidding toward my stolen car. I’ll never forget the look of shock and awe on dudes face when we locked eyes and he realized the jig was up. He looked like he was screaming, “Motherfucka, you mus’ be crazy!!” behind his bulging eyeballs.      When Charity hit the brakes, my arm came loose from the seat belt and I landed on my butt bone, bouncing down the road like an overdressed beach ball. The entire scene scared my poor Mother half to death. Omari just kept laughing like his favorite cartoon Cat Dog had just come on Nick at Nite.Standing there, bruised ego, sore booty bone, and minor scratches, my car sped down the road and disappeared at the next turn. Having done my best—or at least my craziest—we drove home and dropped off the family. I changed into a Wu-Tang Clan black hoodie and a pair of shell-top black on white Adidas, getting ready for whatever. Back in the SUV, Charity and Jonathan talked me down from the ledge. Rather than search for my car, we decided to stop by Amani Raha, a nightclub in Birmingham’s Pepper Place district.Amani Raha was owned by my friend Antonio Minnifield, cousin to ex-football star Terrell “T.O.” Owens. The place was a swank lounge for Birmingham’s Black, grown and sexy set. Walking into the venue, I immediately felt better when the DJ shouted me out; being the center of attention always gave me the fix I needed. At the bar, shots of tequila were lined up and we banged them down like Nomads drinking water in the desert. The night was finally taking a turn for the better. Word had spread about my car getting stolen, and my loss to Birmingham J at the B.A.M.A’s, so the drinks and sympathy flowed in abundance. Fuck it; it was my birthday after all, time to celebrate.About an hour into the party, with bodies gyrating and sweating all over the place, I was invited to partake in the ceremonial “Birthday Blunt”.  Stepping outside to “put it in the air”, we walked out of the venue to a nearby street corner, only to realize we didn’t have the requisite lighter for the task at hand. I waved to Charity who was also outside and asked if she could solve our dilemma. With all the proper ingredients for the consecration in hand, no sooner than I lit the ritual herb stick, here comes my stolen car, the 1987 Jeep Cherokee, tearing around the corner and passing us in a cloud of dust. I couldn’t fucking believe it. My jaw dropped. As the shock wore off, Charity turned to me and let out a loud, “HAPPY BIRTHDAY MOTHAFUCKAAAAH!!” BAHAHAHA!!I’ll tell you, we laughed harder than I had in a long time that night. Turns out, the thief was joy riding around the South Side before leaving my car stripped and abandoned near the “Piggly Wiggly,” a grocery store off Claremont Avenue in Birmingham. I found the damn thing three weeks later when an acquaintance spotted it in an apartment building’s parking lot, ironically, right underneath a NO PARKING ANYTIME sign.The year 2007 had shot its first salvo across the bow of my life’s ship. Although I was grateful to have the jeep a friend nicknamed “Christine” back, I could never have predicted the role it would play in the life-changing episode to come a few months later.",2.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>Travel is the only thing you can buy that makes you richer.</h3>
<p>My name is Bonny. I believe that  the best education we can give our kids is to instill in them genuine life-long curiosity about this world and to teach them skills that will help them satisfy that curiosity. Nothing motivates to learn about something more than coming into direct contact with it: when we can see, hear, touch, smell, and taste. And to see, hear, touch, smell, and taste more of the world one needs to get around! That is exactly why I believe that travel is one of the best premises for sustained state of curiosity, and it is important to teach kids from the very early age that we don't just travel to get from point A to point B, but that the journey itself can enrich our lives in a most profound way, given that we are in the right state of mind to glean from every aspect of the journey. </p>
<p>One of the main ideas behind this book is to motivate both children and adults to learn ''the language this world is written in''. Just like you have to learn the alphabet to appreciate even the simplest of books, so you have to learn tons of background information to truly appreciate any point in space and time and to see how it is woven into the fabric of history. </p>
<p>Another goal is to educate against prejudices in a fun and engaging way and to celebrate diversity. The more younger generation sees the world as a friendly place the less they will learn to look for enemies, and what you learn as a kid affects what you do as an adult. </p>
<p>On a more practical note, my aim is to teach the kids through this book how to deal with day to day traveling challenges while we travel around the world with our little hero, Pitomoti!</p>
<p>This book is just the beginning of a bigger project,  which involves a series of books on travel, travelers' club on instagram, educational games, unique water bottles for kids, backpacks, etc. I think it's important to make the kids feel ''at home'' and comfortable when they travel the world. My dream is to create a ""travelers' club"", so that kids from around the world can communicate through  special ''sign language'' and share their experiences with each other.(More to come on that!)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My starting goal is to print a minimum of 1000 copies.</p>
</div><div>
<p>I will need $10,000 for illustration and publication of the first book.</p>
<p>$3000-will be paid to illustrator. (Illustrator-Tatiana Kochan)</p>
<p>$4000-for publishing 1000 books</p>
<p>$3000-for translating the book in English, German,Spanish, French, Swedish, Japanese.</p>
<p>There will also be little recycle bags with illustration, post card, and club membership card which can be used for when kids are traveling to get ""Pitomoti points""</p>

<h3>A Study in Publishing</h3>
<p>Please allow me to introduce myself. My name is Alexandra; I am a marketing specialist and a passionate book blogger recently admitted for a PhD at the Centre for Research in Marketing and Society belonging to the University of Sheffield. I am planning to focus on the Publishing Market and study the effects of digital marketing on early-career authors, publishing houses and the publishing industry in general. The title of my research is ""Early Career Fiction Authors and the Digital Economy: A Critical Review of the Role of Digital Marketing in a Time of Disruptive Innovation” and my goal is to offer an in-depth understanding of how the publishing market works today and the ways in which indie authors can be aided to better achieve their goals.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>In search of the Lost Author</h3>
<p>The goal of my project is twofold:</p>
<ul>
<li value=""NaN"">To study the difficulties that early-career authors, especially independent (or self-published) authors face as they struggle to gain a foothold in the publishing market; and</li>
<li value=""NaN"">To explore ways that digital media can help them promote their work and transition from independent publishing to traditional or ‘legacy’ publishing houses.</li>
</ul>
<p align=""left"">Given the chance, I plan to fund my field research and cover the costs of traveling around Europe to meet with successful and early-career authors, attend book festivals and book launches, interview publishing executives and organize author gatherings to gain an inside perspective of how the market works.</p>
<h3 align=""left""><strong>How This Study Will Help Bring New Life To The Publishing Market: </strong></h3>
<ul>
<li align=""left"">Early Career Authors – my study will allow early-career authors to identify and utilize tested and proven strategies that will help them raise awareness and avoid common mistakes when branding their books. This will allow them to break into a volatile and changing publishing industry in a cost-effective way</li>
<li align=""left"">Publishing Houses – my research will bridge the gap between independent authors and publishing houses, thus allowing them to regain some of the market, understand the intricate details of digital marketing and use the data provided to adapt their strategies to the new age.</li>
<li align=""left"">Academics – other professionals will be able to discover the theoretical and practical frameworks of the publishing industry and evaluate the role of social media, digital marketing and online tools in the process.</li>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>A wise man in Italy once said, <strong>""ART SPEAKS TO THE HEART</strong>.<strong>"" </strong>We've all watched a good movie that moved us to tears, or read a great story that filled us with hope. <strong>STORIES</strong> can <strong>change us</strong>, <strong>heal us</strong>, and give us<strong> food for thought</strong>. <strong>The Other Side Of Visible </strong>is a such a book. I invite your contribution to <i>art that will speak to the heart </i>of its readers.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Challenges</h3>
<p>For the last number of years my husband and I have been serving in France and Europe to better people's lives through training and informal counseling, and we don't have the means to do a print run of this size on our own. That's why we're inviting your help.</p>
<p>And just FYI, throughout the last twelve years, I've successfully launched the printing and self-publishing of two books, so I know what it takes and I'm committed to following through.</p>

</div></div>","The Story—
Old man Oscar insists there's a family in an invisible world called OtherSide that will take in homeless Shin McConnell and her only street friend Dibs Colby. They're convinced he's nuts...until a narrow escape from the police catapults Shin headlong into invisible worlds. There she finds she has enemies out to make her life miserable, unseen Watchers who trail her twenty-four hours a day, and most surprisingly—personal ties to the royal family of OtherSide. But an unexpected encounter in that realm threatens to destroy her trust, and Shin is forced to choose between facing the pain of her past, or rejecting her place in OtherSide.
 
The Author—(that's me)

Hi! I'm Janet Keller Richards, and I've been writing for most of my life—published articles in magazines and newspapers, two self-published nonfiction books, full-length plays and musicals, and more. And THIS PROJECT is my favorite, my passion!
 

 
How you can be a part of it
The process of contributing to my campaign is very simple: on the right side of this campaign page, find a reward tier that interests you: hover over it with your cursor and click on ""GET THIS PERK."" It's that simple! Rewards range from a very cool bookmark or an eye-catching fridge magnet of the book's front cover, to your own signed copy of the book or a beautiful handmade picnic basket, or helping Third World families move out of poverty.


On the higher reward tiers of this campaign, through Heifer International you'll be helping third world families move out of poverty and into self-sustaining lifestyles.  Heifer International is a global nonprofit organization working to eradicate poverty and hunger through sustainable, values-based holistic community development. Purchasing shares in the purchases of goats, sheep, pigs, flocks of chicks, water buffaloes, and heifers is like giving them a small business, providing wool, milk, eggs and more. Animal donations can provide these families a hand up, giving increasing access to medicine, school, food and more. On some of the reward tiers of this campaign, there are opportunities to give toward purchasing all of the animals mentioned previously...and help impoverished families!

 
What We Need & What You Get
The book is already written, so you won't have to wait for a long time to get your rewards. As soon as the Indiegogo campaign is completed it will go to print, and I expect that all rewards will be fulfilled within a month or two after the books are shipped to me.


$7,000.00 will enable the printing of 1500 paperback books, 352 pages in length. In addition to printing the books, that amount also includes formatting and design costs, freight costs to ship the books to storage, postage and packaging material for the rewards, Indiegogo fees and credit card/Paypal processing fees.
If you help me reach the campaign goal of $7,000.00 I'll celebrate until the cows come home (and then get busy printing the books and sending off your rewards)!

 


The Impact
A wise man in Italy once said, ""ART SPEAKS TO THE HEART."" We've all watched a good movie that moved us to tears, or read a great story that filled us with hope. STORIES can change us, heal us, and give us food for thought. The Other Side Of Visible is a such a book. I invite your contribution to art that will speak to the heart of its readers.
 

Challenges
For the last number of years my husband and I have been serving in France and Europe to better people's lives through training and informal counseling, and we don't have the means to do a print run of this size on our own. That's why we're inviting your help.
And just FYI, throughout the last twelve years, I've successfully launched the printing and self-publishing of two books, so I know what it takes and I'm committed to following through.
 


Help by Spreading The Word!
You can also help me by SHARING, SHARING, SHARING, on social media. Use Indiegogo's ""Share"" tools and feel free to plaster this campaign all over your social media, or by email, etc! If you do, I'll do my living room happy dance...and maybe even video it for Facebook. And THAT is something you don't want to miss.

of The Other Side Of Visible, absolutely FREE:

<p>Everyone loves a good story, filled with fun characters and crazy complications. Communicating a great story through a sequence of images is a lot of fun for me. It can be challenging and very rewarding. 'Other Worlds' is only a step in that direction for me. This is my third book and it humbles me to create a book that is so much bigger then me. I enjoy learning as I go and every new book is filled with obstacles and sometimes roadblocks. I can't count the number of times I wanted to give up on this project. Fairies and monsters, goblins and aliens, it's all in this coloring book.</p>
<p>It's time for some help. I have all these great characters living in their complicated environments. Compiled together to help you relieve stress by coloring them.</p>
<p>Your donation will help me make this book a reality. A fantasy coloring book can become a reality.</p>
<p>What a concept! Thank you so much for contributing. I promise to give you a fantastical book, filled with hours of coloring enjoyment. </p>

<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get?</h3>
<p>I need some money to make this a reality and you can help with that.</p>

<p>Maybe you don't want a coloring book, but think this idea is pretty cool. Go ahead and tell all your friends. Word of mouth and sharing this project helps me too! Indiegogo has social tools for sharing. Please help me spread the word.</p>
<p>Maybe you want more than just a coloring book. I'm offering some fun bonus items for you. This part of campaigning is always fun for me. I enjoy offering fun, little perks with my books.</p>
</div><div>
<p>Studies prove that coloring relieves the stresses of everyday life. I want this coloring book to relax you. Everyone has memories of coloring in a coloring book. Let's make some more memories together.</p>
<p>I want to hear from you after this campaign is over and you started coloring in your new coloring book. I want to see all the color and effort you will be investing in this wacky book. Reach out to me and let me know what you think. I want to hear from everyone. You are the people that will make this book a reality. </p>
<p>I'll be providing you with updates about the campaign. Final page edits. Deadlines and other goals that will happen for us along the way. I want you to be involved and informed, along the way.</p>

<p>As a story teller and artist, I want to create a coloring book for us both to be proud of. Filled with pages of wonder. The cool thing about a coloring book project is you get to complete the story. My black and white pages are the backbone to your creative, color palette. It's your coloring techniques that will complete the stories in this book.</p>
<p>I look forward to making a great project with you.</p>

<h3>has just arrived in town! Everyone's invited on a spectacular ride through the memory of rare vintage circus illustrations in this fun, even comical read.</h3>

<p><i>***a hardback mockup</i></p>
<p>Hello, Indiegogo World! I'm Anders Roseberg, children's book author. I've been working with children for roughly 12 years. I also love vintage memorabilia, antiques, rare photographs, and I absolutely love the feel of the circus life back in the 1900's. That's why I am excited about our new project, <strong><i>The Wondrous Wandering Acrobats Show.</i></strong></p>
<p><strong>We understand the worries of what animal roles are in the book. Rest assured, there are NO pages that showcase any cruelty towards animals. In fact, other than horseback riding, any animals in the book are more like the human acrobats in the book. They can move freely, do stunts, or talk. No cages, no whips.</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1493342885/vzea6mrif0ir0hs8kqpa.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Take a look below at what we're doing in a nutshell. Here's a close look at an original illustrated poster dated 1898 - </p>

<p>As you can see from the sample above, the illustrations seem to climb out of the page so to speak. </p>
<p>Here's another example of the train chugging out of the illustration.</p>

<p>Supporting our campaign is a wonderful chance to share the history of the circus, but also, helps preserve and restore these collected images for the generations now and generations to come in a fun-to-read story! Most of these images have been lost and forgotten. Some are over 100 years old!</p>
<p>As a contributor, you can help us achieve our funding goal by getting <strong><i>The Wondrous Traveling Acrobats Show</i></strong> retouched and edited into full and half page spreads, traditionally printed and bound, and delivered to the imaginations of children, and in the hands of vintage circus lovers all over the globe!</p>

<p>Well that would be fantastic, wouldn't it!</p>

<ul>
<li> It stimulates imagination and can expand their understanding about the world we live in. </li>
<li> Book time can provide a quiet and calm time.</li>
<li>A book like this opens the door for discussion for the curious.</li>
<li>Reading books can also teach print concepts of the rules of reading. (up down, left to right) </li>
<li> It teaches language skills and opens a door to new vocabulary. </li>
<li>Teaches an appreciation for art and the art of writing. </li>
<li> It allows a time for parent and child to bond. </li>

has just arrived in town! Everyone's invited on a spectacular ride through the memory of rare vintage circus illustrations in this fun, even comical read.

***a hardback mockup
Hello, Indiegogo World! I'm Anders Roseberg, children's book author. I've been working with children for roughly 12 years. I also love vintage memorabilia, antiques, rare photographs, and I absolutely love the feel of the circus life back in the 1900's. That's why I am excited about our new project, The Wondrous Wandering Acrobats Show.
We understand the worries of what animal roles are in the book. Rest assured, there are NO pages that showcase any cruelty towards animals. In fact, other than horseback riding, any animals in the book are more like the human acrobats in the book. They can move freely, do stunts, or talk. No cages, no whips.

Take a look below at what we're doing in a nutshell. Here's a close look at an original illustrated poster dated 1898 - 

A touch of magic! Bipiti, bopiti, boo! Retouched and edited.

And now the full page spread with story
 

As you can see from the sample above, the illustrations seem to climb out of the page so to speak. 
Here's another example of the train chugging out of the illustration.

Supporting our campaign is a wonderful chance to share the history of the circus, but also, helps preserve and restore these collected images for the generations now and generations to come in a fun-to-read story! Most of these images have been lost and forgotten. Some are over 100 years old!
As a contributor, you can help us achieve our funding goal by getting The Wondrous Traveling Acrobats Show retouched and edited into full and half page spreads, traditionally printed and bound, and delivered to the imaginations of children, and in the hands of vintage circus lovers all over the globe!


To get the ball rolling, we're shooting for a modest goal of 2,500 USD. This is a list of where the pledges will go.

 

A Traditional Printed Book with Traditional Binding (42%) 
 Shipping Books (25%) 
 Editing, Design, Proofing, Finishing (10%) 
 Marketing (10%) 
 Campaign Fees (5%) 
 ISBN Numbers Fees, and Dues (2%) 


We have a variety of different perks ranging from a $3 e-book format of your choosing or a 32-page traditionally printed and bound hardback book. We have some freebies for exceeding our goal, but it will depend on how much buzz for The Wondrous Wandering Acrobats Show we can get.




***a hardback mock-up


32 page book with spreads and half spreads 

8.5 X 11 inches closed 

hardback for long lasting 
high quality and traditionally printed and bound 
unique illustrations on every page that open imaginations and discussions 
large 16 pt reading font 
ending ""Author's Note"" about the book and brief history of circuses
rhythmic story that teaches vocabulary in a fun ""tongue twister"" way


The vastly different illustrations will mesmerize and because of the witty rhyming, it's super catchy and fun. Whether it's learning new vocabulary, learning the rhythm and rhyme, or just enjoying the illustrations, kids catch something new, each time they read it!  

***a paperback mockup

Some of the images are edited around the exciting story. For example, on this page it reads, ""The steam engine is ready. Big tents are coming down..."" You can see that the old original image has tents upright. Now take a look at the edited image which has the top part of the tent coming down! 


The Wondrous Wandering Acrobats Show is an important piece of a collected lost history. These rare circus posters have been gathered, collected, edited and brought together in a fun, exciting, and even hilarious story. This book is literally history at the fingertips. With successful funding, you can pat yourselves on the back for bringing a light to a lost, hidden past, that was sitting in a dark vault for almost a century.

This may be the first and last time to get this collection of vintage circus posters under one cover and with such a story to accommodate them. 

Well that would be fantastic, wouldn't it!
After we exceed our goal, the first thing I want to do is include an audiobook free with every reward! It would be great to have the backers help pick a great voice actor and discuss the music! Audiobooks are great for listening comprehension as well as a good guide to help early readers. They're great on longer drives and fantastic before bed. 
Let's focus on hitting that goal and getting the free audiobook. Then we'll roll out some stretch goals.

In the event we don't reach our goal, funds will go towards the printing, and I'll have to seek funding elsewhere. Those from the Indiegogo world who contributed will still get their reward but it may not be possible for such a special and unique binding option and the free audiobook would NOT be included.

<h3>Short Summary:</h3>
<p>First off, I am not a professional writer; I am a law enforcement professional that happens to be a conservative millennial....that also likes to write. I have developed a sense of where my profession is going, and how my generation will improve it. Millennials have developed a poor reputation amongst other generations, but there are those of us that are ready to take the reins of an entire profession to begin fixing it. Criminal Justice reform is nothing new, and books on the topic aren't new either, but how my generation can start fixing it, is. This book will cover topics such as understanding the millennial officer, prison overcrowding, the devaluation of the criminal justice degree, data-driven analytics, substance abuse, victim-centered approaches, dynamic search warrants, predictive policing, and other hot topics as we move into the future. It takes money for cover art, editing, publishing, etcetera. That's why I am asking for your help, and hope you can back my project. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need:</h3>
<p>I am raising funds to provide the best product possible to get these pragmatic approaches into as many hands as possible. These funds will go towards book cover design, audio, editing, publishing, etcetera. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Very soon the millennial generation will be in charge, period. Whether that scares the hell out of you or not, doesn't matter, it's coming. Now, we as millennials can continue to be perceived as the whiniest and laziest generation there has ever been or....we can show the world that we are the most educated and technologically advanced generation in the world. Not only are we going to run the Criminal Justice system, but we are also going to take it to a height most never thought possible. It is time for a collective group of millennial, professional, criminal justice practitioners, to begin emerging with innovative ideas and practicality that can change the world.</p>

<h3><i>Here is the story of ""The Silk Road revisited...""</i></h3>
<p>This exciting new book, ""The Silk Road Revisited"", by Nick Rowan invites us to take an <strong>astonishing cultural journey throughout Europe, Central Asia and China </strong>along one of the world’s oldest trading routes. Take an exhilarating voyage from the comfort of your armchair and find out more about the history, culture and traditions of each country while marveling at the exquisite accompanying photography.  </p>
<p>This is no ordinary book on history – it is a personal view of the Silk Road’s fascinating history that has made each country that once lined its route what it is today. Charting a course from West to East, the book deviates from the traditional East to West depiction of the Silk Road. The engaging text is complimented by captivating photography as the reader travels from charming and powerful Venice to the homeland of the Yellow Dragon, China, from snow-capped mountains of Kyrgyzstan to the vast steppes of Kazakhstan and from the fearless Turkic tribes to the noble Persian empires. Each chapter the reader also encounters the diverse peoples, delicious cuisine and delightful landscapes.</p>
<p>Traveling through the pages of the book, the reader seamlessly moves from the familiar world of Europe to the less familiar territories of Central Asia and the mystique of the East. The book captures attention with its elegant design, cultural charm and unfurls like an unsolved mystery. <strong>Venice, Turkey, Persia, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, and China - The Great Silk Road </strong>once united countries, empires and religions. Common goals and one soul, meant often melted away the differences in culture, language and the distance between them.</p>

My name is Zachary Allen and I am the Founder and President of Cardinal Chronicles. Born in Charlotte, North Carolina, I grew up in the nearby town of Indian Trail, and have called North Carolina home my entire life. Currently, I am a Junior at East Carolina University (Go Pirates!), and am working towards a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science. </p><p>Today, you are reading the cliff-notes of a company and product that was designed and built to inspire and empower those who call the Old North State home. Our product is simple: we want to create a magazine publication that provides its readers with four simple items:</p><p><strong>Number one</strong>: a way of keeping up-to-date with all the political, social and economic news that is relevant to their corner of the world. We do this by empowering and utilizing local and regional news sources to give you the details on issues that truly matter to your life and livelihood.</p><p><strong>Number two</strong>: providing you with the information needed to identify, and keep reported on the actions and inactions of your political representatives. This will include refreshing transparency on your elected officials; ranging from your Mayor, to N.C. House Representatives in Raleigh, to Congressmen and women and Senators in D.C. </p><p><strong>Number three</strong>: a section dedicated to the elementary steps related to participating in our democracy. Information that should be available to all citizens; which include helpful resources on knowing how to register, where to and when to vote; as well as all general information related to upcoming elections in your community.</p><p>… and finally – we empower and inspire our readers with a tool groundbreaking in its design, and unique to our product, and that is a little something we call: <strong>The North Carolina Scorecard.</strong></p><p>In order to truly understand the North Carolina Scorecard, we must take a step back in time.</p><p>This entire campaign really has its roots in another campaign; that of Entrepreneur and Political Candidate, Andrew Yang. Andrew Yang had a vision for the future which among other qualities, sought for us to see ourselves not simply as means to economic ends, but as human beings with intrinsic value, nuance, complexity, and strength. </p><h3>He believed that when you measure something, you implicitly set your policy goals.</h3><p>Traditionally, our economy has been measured by looking at, essentially, two numbers: the gross domestic product (GDP) or the stock market. Employment rates and household income are also used to measure how the average worker is doing. </p><p>However, even the creator of the GDP admits that it doesn’t really reflect the full story. And, as economic inequality rises and the fruits of society’s labors accrue to fewer individuals, it’s become obvious that we need to expand our definition of economic prosperity past a single number. The bottom 80% of Americans only own 8% of stocks and rising GDP has virtually no relationship with each citizen's wellbeing.</p><p>By focusing our measurement on GDP, we’ve promoted production over all else. It’s time to start measuring economic prosperity using a wider index that measures human as well as monetary indicators, such as:</p><ul>
<li>Access to Education </li>
<li>Affordability of Living </li>
<li>Childhood Success Rates</li>
<li>Consumer and Student Debt</li>
<li>Economic Mobility </li>
<li>Environmental Quality </li>
<li>Felony Rehabilitation </li>
<li>Freedom from Substance Abuse</li>
<li>Happiness Index </li>
<li>Health-Adjusted Life Expectancy </li>
<li>Income Inequality</li>
<li>Infant Mortality </li>
<li>Marriage and Divorce Rates </li>
<li>National Optimism </li>
<li>Quality of Infrastructure </li>
<li>Quality of Life </li>
<li>Underemployment </li>
<li>Veterans Security</li>
<li>Volunteerism</li>

My name is Zachary Allen and I am the Founder and President of Cardinal Chronicles. Born in Charlotte, North Carolina, I grew up in the nearby town of Indian Trail, and have called North Carolina home my entire life. Currently, I am a Junior at East Carolina University (Go Pirates!), and am working towards a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science. Today, you are reading the cliff-notes of a company and product that was designed and built to inspire and empower those who call the Old North State home. Our product is simple: we want to create a magazine publication that provides its readers with four simple items:Number one: a way of keeping up-to-date with all the political, social and economic news that is relevant to their corner of the world. We do this by empowering and utilizing local and regional news sources to give you the details on issues that truly matter to your life and livelihood.Number two: providing you with the information needed to identify, and keep reported on the actions and inactions of your political representatives. This will include refreshing transparency on your elected officials; ranging from your Mayor, to N.C. House Representatives in Raleigh, to Congressmen and women and Senators in D.C. Number three: a section dedicated to the elementary steps related to participating in our democracy. Information that should be available to all citizens; which include helpful resources on knowing how to register, where to and when to vote; as well as all general information related to upcoming elections in your community.… and finally – we empower and inspire our readers with a tool groundbreaking in its design, and unique to our product, and that is a little something we call: The North Carolina Scorecard.In order to truly understand the North Carolina Scorecard, we must take a step back in time.This entire campaign really has its roots in another campaign; that of Entrepreneur and Political Candidate, Andrew Yang. Andrew Yang had a vision for the future which among other qualities, sought for us to see ourselves not simply as means to economic ends, but as human beings with intrinsic value, nuance, complexity, and strength. He believed that when you measure something, you implicitly set your policy goals.Traditionally, our economy has been measured by looking at, essentially, two numbers: the gross domestic product (GDP) or the stock market. Employment rates and household income are also used to measure how the average worker is doing. However, even the creator of the GDP admits that it doesn’t really reflect the full story. And, as economic inequality rises and the fruits of society’s labors accrue to fewer individuals, it’s become obvious that we need to expand our definition of economic prosperity past a single number. The bottom 80% of Americans only own 8% of stocks and rising GDP has virtually no relationship with each citizen's wellbeing.By focusing our measurement on GDP, we’ve promoted production over all else. It’s time to start measuring economic prosperity using a wider index that measures human as well as monetary indicators, such as:
Access to Education 
Affordability of Living 
Childhood Success Rates
Consumer and Student Debt
Economic Mobility 
Environmental Quality 
Felony Rehabilitation 
Freedom from Substance Abuse
Happiness Index 
Health-Adjusted Life Expectancy 
Income Inequality
Infant Mortality 
Marriage and Divorce Rates 
National Optimism 
Quality of Infrastructure 
Quality of Life 
Underemployment 
Veterans Security
Volunteerism
Work and Civic Engagement Levels 
In short, why use GDP as a proxy for how Americans (& North Carolinians) are doing when we can easily measure that well-being directly? Help us here at Cardinal Chronicles launch our magazine publication, and inside of each magazine; our readers will find information on local political news, and the reports on the actions and inactions of your representatives as well as the constantly updated, county-focused chronicle of the North Carolina Scorecard.  Cardinal CosmosWe knew from the very beginning that in order to best bring the vision of Cardinal Chronicles to reality, we would need to rely on new and exciting strategies.

<h3> Short Summary</h3>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>About Me</strong></p>
<p>I am Naasu Fofanah, a Pentland Scholar, an International Development and Public Administration professional specializing in Gender &amp; Global Public Policy. I also am the Founder of Susue Consultancy in Sierra Leone delivering Executive Policy Advisory, Training and Coaching services. </p>
<p>Furthermore, I serve as Deputy Chairperson of Unity Party Sierra Leone intending to increase participation and representation of women in political party governance. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37xTcxXvaY"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37xTcxXvaY</a></p>
<p>In 2019, I was also elected Board Chairperson of the Sierra Leone Rugby Union and have succeeded in influencing gender parity reforms with 5 women 4 men; established the Women’s Rugby Advisory Committee and a minimum 30% women in the Executive. This attracted the attention of World Rugby  (<a href=""https://www.world.rugby/news/435759?lang=en"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.world.rugby/news/435759?lang=en</a>).</p>
<p>Previously, I served as Special Gender Adviser to the erstwhile President of Sierra Leone where I spearheaded innovative policy initiatives on Gender Equality and Women’s Empowerment. I consider myself an avid Women and Girls Advocate whose work contributes to the global policy discourse on gender issues.   </p>
<p><strong>My Story</strong></p>
<p>It is an honour to be able to share my incredible personal story via my book ""Leave it Naasu - How to Take Charge and go for what you want.""  </p>
<p>Born and raised in Sierra Leone, at age 23 I was lucky enough to flee the devastating civil war for the United Kingdom and the United States. Growing up in a single-parent household with scarce resources and very few opportunities was not easy for me and my siblings. As the eldest, responsibility for myself and family came early. From age 17. I found myself dealing with the burden of this responsibility coupled with the consequences of abuse and rape. I was determined to succeed despite the socio-economic status of my parents and numerous other obstacles.</p>
<p>I knew instinctively that education was the key to breaking that cycle and nothing was going to stand in my way. My educational achievements have been exceptional. I started university as an insecure 31-year single mother who was going through a very difficult time in 2001.</p>
<p>Today, I hold the following academic qualifications: Joint Executive Master of Public Administration – New York University (NYU Wagner) &amp; University College London (2018) with full scholarship from Pentland; Master of Arts in Education, Gender &amp; International Development – Institute of Education UCL (2005); Bachelor of Science (Hons)- University of Westminster (2004)     </p>
<p>In Sierra Leone, I have contributed immensely to public policy reforms by spearheading the most transformative gender policy agenda on national policy.</p>
<p>As the only female pillar Lead for the development of the National five-year strategy - Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP 2013-2018), I successfully advocated and lobbied to have this historic initiative to have a separate pillar on Gender Equality and Women's Empowerment. This move led to increased awareness including 4% more funding from the government to the Gender Ministry coupled with more financial and programme support from development partners.</p>
<p><strong>An Authoritative Voice</strong></p>
<p>I have an authoritative voice on key women's rights issues in my country and globally. For example, as a rape survivor, I have been courageous in sharing my story to my country and the world which has encouraged other women and girls to openly talk about their ordeals. Through my 50th speaker series advocacy platform, I have addressed and engaged 16 schools and approximately 13000 students in Sierra Leone and Ghana. My goal is to support girls who are victims while sharing preventive strategies to those at risks.</p>
<p>The decision to finally write my book came from the experiences of sharing my story with schools in 2019. The questions and appetite to hear more about how I overcame the hurdles from both boys and girls finally helped me to break the culture of not writing.  They have been my motivation and I am determined to make this book available to as many schools as possible all over the world. Your pledges would make this a reality for me and many children.       </p>
<p><strong>Sharing My Story</strong></p>
<p>However, writing and publishing a book requires commitment, enthusiasm and determination to achieve its objectives. Financing could be a huge impediment; therefore, I have decided to invite you to support me overcome this challenge my backing me on this mission.</p>
<p>My journey and the strategies to overcoming obstacles and how to succeed would be shared in this book as a testament of determination, resilience and humanity. Sharing my story is important because my experiences, unfortunately, remain the norm for millions of women and girls in developing countries and especially in Africa.</p>
<p>The number of female authors from developing countries is still relatively low. Few women from my country write books and those who do, mostly shy away from sharing personal experiences to avoid negative judgements. Furthermore, the reading culture is extremely limited in many developing countries including Sierra Leone. My wish is to increase the number of writers to facilitate a reading culture in my country. I want my book to reach millions of school-age girls as a source of motivation while also establishing me as an author.  </p>
<p><strong>Collaboration with Rethink Press</strong></p>
<p>I have signed my contract with Rethink Press, an independent hybrid publisher specializing in working with entrepreneurs, coaches and independent consultants to get their businesses or self-help books written and published.  The Managing Editor is Lucy McCarraher and Joe Gregory is the Managing Publisher of Rethink Press whose work is of exceptional quality.

Rethink Press publishes all titles to Amazon.co.uk, Amazon.com, other Amazon territories where appropriate, and Amazon Kindle.  Rethink Press also distributes through the following wholesalers: Nielsen BookData, Bowker, BDS, Gardners, Ingram Books,</p>

<p>I want you to be part of my amazing journey and this is my invitation to join me.   </p>

I’m Stewart C. Alastair. I spent 10 years working for lawyers and there I became a published writer as a Legal Assistant.
This campaign is important not only for me but for those who will read these books. I believe Bible believing Christians are about to become the outcasts of the world. Christianity will be on trial once church pastors give in to ecumenism; that is the gathering of all religions under one Universal doctrine.
As much as this campaign will assist me in publishing my books, I believe that the greater benefit will be for those that read my books. As Christians become increasingly the bane of society, this book foreshadows that process.

What We Need & What You Get

After looking at the cost of publishing physical books, I calculated exactly the amount that would need to be raised. $1781.00 will be enough for self-publishing the remaining two books in this series.
For various pledge amounts you will receive:
Damon Black Trilogy t-shirt.
A 99¢ cent Amazon code for Book II.


Each dollar pledged will go to creating three things:  
The Book Interior design.
The cover art.
A special edition of Book II, which will contain bonus material.
Q and A section.
Chapter 1 of Book III.





The Impact

Your contribution to this project will reach both Christians and non-Christians from all different backgrounds.
The success of publishing Book I was a minor achievement. But the following two books will be the crowning achievement. 

With the “99¢ perk” contributors will be able to purchase books for friends and family at a fraction of the usual cost.

Other Ways You Can Help
If you can’t contribute financially, there are other things that are equally important:
First and foremost, PRAYER!
Second, tell a friend about the Damon Black Trilogy and that they can buy Book I on Amazon or GooglePlay right now!
Third, if you read my books and like them, please put a good review on Amazon or Google.

per promuovere la valorizzazione e/o un riuso illuminato dei luoghi simbolo del patrimonio e della storia del lavoro e dell'industria della città
perchè valorizzando questi luoghi, possiamo ampliare l'offerta turistica locale, strutturando percorsi alla scoperta della storia e della cultura industriali della città, la quale ebbe un importante ruolo a livello nazionale ed internazionale;
