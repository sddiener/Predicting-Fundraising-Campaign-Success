<p>My Background</p>
<p>My name is Bernd Christian Geels. I was born in Irving, Texas in 1973. My father is an American citizen who grew up in rural Arkansas. My mother is a native citizen of Germany. I developed a deep curiosity in the world around me at an early age. My curiosity made it rather natural for me to later become a scientist. I have studied a variety of disciplines in my formal education. The subjects I have primarily studied include atmospheric science, environmental policy, philosophy, theology and psychology.</p>
<p>My Motivation</p>
<p>I wish to attend the Climate Reality Leadership Corps training offered in Atlanta, Georgia in March, 2019. My education and professional history long ago convinced me that climate change is an urgent policy issue that necessitates an innovative, intensive and creative response at the local, national and international level. Upon completion of the training I wish to contribute my knowledge and passion to inspire meaningful action on this issue in my local community in New England. Given data suggesting we could reach a ""tipping point"" on climate change as soon as 2030 I believe it's vital we move in the direction of creating a more sustainable national and international economy as soon as possible.</p>
<p>A good friend in Atlanta has offered me lodging during the training. I simply need help creating the funds for my travel. In making a contribution towards my travel fund you will ultimately help me work to address our climate challenge in New England and, in effect, throughout the world. What we do every day in ways large and small matters to the future we are creating. I ask that you please help me in this important effort.</p>
<p>I seek to raise $600 to cover the costs of my travel and food expenses for my trip to Atlanta. I have browsed airline tickets and found reasonable offers. Naturally ticket prices will rise as we near the date of the training in mid March. If I am unable to secure sufficient funds to meet my goal I will plan to return the money to those who contribute.</p>
<p>The Impact</p>
<p>Upon completion of the training I will create a presentation that can be customized to address the challenges of climate change particular to the area of Cape Cod and New England. Participants of the Climate Reality Leadership Corps agree to perform ten acts of leadership in the year after their training. Please consult the FAQ section to learn about what constitutes an act of leadership.</p>
<p> I believe this training is very valuable to the world because a fundamental piece of addressing the challenge of climate change is educating the populace to develop a clear understanding of the issue. A number of factors may lead to inaction on pressing policy issues. Awareness of the scope and scale of a problem is critical to cultivating sufficient public will to shift our individual and collective choices.</p>
<p>For those of you unfamiliar with who I am I invite you to visit my blog. During the period of 2013 to 2016 I regularly wrote a trauma recovery blog designed to be a source of both inspiration and education. The blog serves as a good writing sample and example of my commitment to creating a better world.</p>
<p>The Challenge</p>
<p>The main challenge I have in attending this training is raising funds within a limited window of time. I therefore ask you to review my campaign and pose whatever questions you may have. I also invite you to share my campaign with any professional colleagues or personal friends who also deeply care about the issue of climate change.</p>
<p>How You Can Help</p>
<p>If you cannot help me with a contribution to my travel fund that doesn't mean you cannot help at all! If you care deeply about climate change there are many ways you can respond. Here are just a few ideas:</p>
<p>Reduce your use of your car by taking public transportation or carpooling whenever possible. Combine trips as a way of reducing wasteful fuel consumption.</p>
<p>Go to your local library and explore what your city and county are doing right now to address the issue of climate change.</p>
<p>Eat a less carbon intensive diet. </p>
<p>Manage your personal property with sustainability in mind. The flora and fauna of your region will be impacted by climate change. Consider learning about existing research into anticipated impacts and then collaborate with neighbors in an effort to maintain wild and green spaces.</p>

Many of these programs often focus on one small area or habitat of California. However, the habitats and species I am filming do not stand alone they interconnect with others throughout a larger areas called <strong>bioregions</strong>. </em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><em><span style=""color: #ad3458; font-size: large;"">California has over 280 threatened<br/>and endangered plant and animal species!<img alt=""Yosemite Trees"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/558464/pictures/full/20121128173543-Yosemite_Oaks_in_Winter.jpg?1354152947"" src="""" style=""float: right; margin: 5px;""/></span></em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>My goal with </em><em><em><strong>The Wilds of California</strong></em> is to film and photograph California's varied landscapes based on these bioregions and create an inspirational film and photo presentation that will open eyes, touch hearts and ultimately increase appreciation for California's spectacular and complex natural diversity. </em></p>
<p><em>This is a project I have been working on for some time and now and with your support and that of the indiegogo community, I hope to see it completed. Your reward for supporting <strong>The Wilds of California</strong> goes beyond beautiful DVDs and photographic prints, </em><em><em>since I will be working closely with conservation organizations within these bioregions, </em>it is knowing that you are also helping to increase awareness of conservation efforts throughout </em><em>California</em><em>.</em></p>

<h3><strong>THE PROJECT</strong></h3>

Jim Karnik, photographer/filmmaker  
Over the last 25 years I have been fortunate to film and photograph much of California's natural landscapes and wildlife while working with conservancies to produce films for broadcast, web and theater presentation. Many of these programs often focus on one small area or habitat of California. However, the habitats and species I am filming do not stand alone they interconnect with others throughout a larger areas called bioregions. 
 
California has over 280 threatenedand endangered plant and animal species!
 
My goal with The Wilds of California is to film and photograph California's varied landscapes based on these bioregions and create an inspirational film and photo presentation that will open eyes, touch hearts and ultimately increase appreciation for California's spectacular and complex natural diversity. 
This is a project I have been working on for some time and now and with your support and that of the indiegogo community, I hope to see it completed. Your reward for supporting The Wilds of California goes beyond beautiful DVDs and photographic prints, since I will be working closely with conservation organizations within these bioregions, it is knowing that you are also helping to increase awareness of conservation efforts throughout California.

THE PROJECT
The Wilds of California is a photography & high definition film project that will increase public awareness and appreciation for the unique beauty of wild habitats and species found in California. The ultimate goal of this project is to reach as large an audience as possible through traveling exhibits, web video, DVD and BluRay distribution.
THE FILMThe final 60 minute film will include a series visually powerful vignettes on California's 10 Bioregions. What is a bioregion? ""A bioregion is a place that has commonalities of soil, surface water source, landforms, wildlife, climate and culture."" (USGS/BIOREGIONS)
I will be working with nature conservation organizations throughout the state to help determine the best locations to represent California's bioregions. Each segment in the film visually tells the story of a particular habitat unique to that bioregion, highlighting its key species and characteristics. Segments are designed to use cinematic images, natural sounds and limited music to communicate a sense of place.

The film can be viewed as either an inspirational visual art piece or an informative nature documentary.
EXHIBIT / PRESENTATIONThe Wilds of California film & photography exhibit will premier in San Diego, California in August 2013 and will be made available throughout the state as a traveling exhibit/presentation there after.
In addition, during field production, live presentations on Filming The Wilds of California will be scheduled with local nature conservancies and other community organizations.

 
 
 
 
 
 
ADDITIONAL DISTRIBUTION

The film will be available on DVD & BluRay by August 2013.
Photographic prints and note card sets will also be available at that time.
Short clips from the film will be distributed on-line at Vimeo, YouTube and www.fieldnotes.com throughout production.
Project field notes and discussion topics will be posted on www.fieldnotes.com and The Wilds of California blog.

<h3>We need to raise $5,000 to turn 5 regular cars into share cars.</h3>
<p>We launched our neighbour-to-neighbour car-sharing platform in Bondi, Bronte and Paddington in December 2012. Our in-car technology and online booking platform let anyone turn their car into a share car, and rent it by the hour or day to their neighbours.</p>
<p>This means that people can live car-free most of the time, knowing they can use a car when they really need one. People who car-share end up driving around 40% less, so it's great for the environment and for people's health. Sharing things with neighbours also helps build a sense of community. Plus, everyone saves money.</p>
<p>As you can hear from some of our members in the video below, <a href=""http://www.carnextdoor.com.au"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Car Next Door</a> has really changed the way people use cars. We are really keen to spread the neighbour-to-neighbour car-sharing revolution to Coogee, but it costs money to get each new car up and sharing.</p>
<p>We need your support to bring 5 new cars into the Car Next Door fleet. In return you will save a packet on the cost of borrowing a car (or joining as an owner) when we get to Coogee.</p>
<h3>What is Car Next Door?</h3>
<p>We created Car Next Door to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Build community</li>
<li>Help the environment, and</li>
<li>Save people money.</li>
</ul><p>It's Australia's first Neighbour-to-Neighbour car-sharing platform, and lets you rent cars from your neighbours from $5 an hour or $25 a day.  As a Car Owner, you can make $2-10,000 per year by sharing your car when you’re not using it.</p>
<p>Car Next Door is also a certified carbon-neutral service. We offset all of the emissions from borrowers' driving. </p>
<h3>Our vision: less cars, better cities</h3>
<p>Car Next Door's aim is to reduce Australians' dependency on personal vehicle ownership. By enabling Australians to share their cars with neighbours, we want to fundamentally change the way people make their transport decisions.</p>
<p>We want to get away from 'driving by default' and encourage people to make a conscious decision about how best to get from A to B each time they want to travel. Pay-per-use car access gives people the economic incentives they need to make better choices. <br/><br/><span>Neighbour-to-neighbour car-sharing cuts personal transportation costs, permanently removes cars from the Australian vehicle fleet, reduces emissions of greenhouse gases and local air pollutants and fosters greater community engagement.</span></p>
<h3>Where are we at now?</h3>
<p>Since our launch in December 2012 we have added <a href=""http://www.carnextdoor.com.au/find-a-car/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">40+ share cars</a> to the streets of Bondi, Tamarama, Bronte, Waverly, Bondi Junction, Queens Park, Woollahra and Paddington and have over 400 borrowers using these share cars as means to get around, move house, pick up family at the airport or to take a road trip.</p>

<h2>Want to get involved?</h2>
<h3>What we need</h3>
<p>To launch in Coogee we need at least 5 cars. All of the money raised will go towards installing the in-car device in 5 Coogee residents' cars and creating community awareness so that people will join up and borrow them.  If we dont reach our target, you will be refunded your money, and we will delay our Coogee launch.</p>
<h3>What impact will this have?</h3>
<p>We envision neighbourhoods in five to ten years’ time where most people don’t have to own a car. They can share the cars of the ten to fifteen car owners who live within a 100-metre walk from their home.  Once our network hits this type of critical mass, there will be a massive ‘de car-ing’ of metropolitan Australia. This will bring huge environmental and community benefits (e.g. less congestion and pollution, less need to allocate land for parking spots, and higher public transport adoption).</p>
<p>It will also reduce personal transport costs.</p>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>Apart from our undying gratitute, each pledge value gets you bonus Car Next Door Credit. There are different values and perks for existing and new members. Everyone who pledges will be included on a 'Legends Wall' on our website, so we can say a public thank you for contribution. </p>
<p>Credit can be used to pay for hourly or daily car hire, as well as the per-km charge to cover the petrol. If you are interested in sharing your car, this credit will go towards your monthly membership.</p>
<p><strong>PLEASE NOTE:</strong> Indiegogo does not operate in Australian Dollars. The value you pledge will be charged in USD.</p>
<h3>Current Member's Perks</h3>
<p>Current members will receive the value they have pledged plus 10% bonus credit.</p>

<h3>The Premise:</h3>
<p>Keeping the ELA an active research facility will continue its program of ongoing research, maintaining the integrity of its longitudinal data collection, and permitting researchers to plan for future research projects. </p>

<h3>The Money</h3>
<p>The Canadian government will save approximately $600K from the closure of this research facility, hence the proposed target. If we reach it, we can proceed: if not, you get your money back (that is the strucutre of this crowdsource funding through IndieGogo.com). </p>

<p> </p>
<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>Thank you for joining us in the composting revolution!</p>
<p>My name is Vivian Liao, and I am a Los Angeles-based environmental engineer. I am also a molecular biologist by training.  As the founder of <a href=""http://www.cityearthworm.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">City Earthworm</a>, LLC, I (with the help of <a href=""http://www.t2design.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">T2 Design</a> in Santa Monica, CA) have designed the City Bin, an indoor composter that will not only elevate the relatively marginal status of composting but convince the average person that they CAN and WANT to compost.  Julia Barnett is a musician, avid enviromentalist, and a recent composting convert.  With your help, we hope to make household composting as much a part of the average American's life as brushing one's teeth.</p>
<p>Trash is a growing national and global problem.  According to the Clear Air Council and <a href=""http://garbologychallenge.weebly.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Garbology Challenge</a>, America accounts for over one-third of the world's waste. Most of that trash ends up in landfills. In the United States, one ton of waste per person ends up in landfills each year. Also, about seventy percent of U.S. municipal waste is buried in landfills. Aside from the Great Wall of China, the Fresh Kills landfill in New York City is the only man made structure visible from space!  </p>
<p>However, the growing trash situation is a problem we can all help solve by composting.  Composting is quite possibly the most wonderful thing a single individual can do for the environment.  It is even more beneficial than the recycling of household materials that so many of us already practice.  If you are a gardener, composting also produces the BEST FOOD YOUR PLANTS HAVE EVER MET.  Just by feeding our food waste to the City Bin, we will extend the life of our landfills and vastly reduce the release of greenhouse gases into our atmosphere (and this is just the tip of the iceberg of benefits!).  Composting is also the perfect educational activity for teaching kids about biology, ecology, and global warming (<strong>NOTE:</strong> 5% of our profits will be donated to local schools).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the common perception of indoor household composting remains a combination of ""Eww, gross!"", ""I'd love to, but I just don't have the space"", ""So much work!"", and ""Those composters sure are large, ugly, and expensive!"".</p>
<p>The City Bin changes all of that.  It will be made of recycled plastic and responsibly manufactured in Los Angeles.  It utilizes a space-saving design that will also minimize the materials used in shipping (another environmental benefit!).  It is the size of an average bathroom waste basket and, importantly, something you would be happy to leave on display in your home (instead of hidden under the sink).</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: 5% of profits will be donated to local schools to jumpstart their own sustainability practices.</p>
<p>By contributing to the City Bin by City Earthworm campaign, you will become part of a movement to revolutionize how the average citizen interacts with the environment.  According to the EPA, more than 34 million tons of food waste was generated in 2010, and they account for 14% of all municipal solid waste. Food waste is also the single largest contributor to landfills and incinerators.  The following things happen when we dump food waste into landfills:</p>
<ul>
<li>As food rots, greenhouse gases like methane are produced and enter the atmosphere, intensifying the global climate changes we are already experiencing (methane, by the way, has a Global Warming Potential that is 21 times worse than carbon dioxide).</li>
<li>Food waste takes up LOTS of room in landfills.  Our existing landfills have an average of 28 years left, according to Waste Management in its 2006 Annual Report.  More waste = shorter landfill lifespan. It’s simple math.</li>
<li>We use more synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, which pollute our waters.</li>
</ul>
<p>In contrast, when we compost, all of the potential within food is realized.  By composting:</p>
<ul>
<li>Food waste becomes food for bacteria and fungi.  Decomposition by bacteria and fungi turns food waste into highly nutritious fertilizer for plants, with natural pesticides!</li>
<li>The amount of waste going into landfills and garbage disposals is dramatically reduced.</li>
<li>The amount of greenhouse gases coming from landfills will also be reduced.</li>
<li>The amount of food waste sent down garbage disposals is reduced, lessening the load on our wastewater treatment plants.</li>
<li>Your trash will be less stinky!</li>
<li>You can even sell your compost!</li>
<li>You can teach your children valuable lessons about biology, ecology, and sustainability.</li>
</ul>
<p>Many composters already exist on the market.  However, most of them have failed to turn composting into a common household practice because they are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Large and bulky</li>
<li>Require strength to turn and dispose of compost</li>
<li>Require the user to have a yard/chickens (for example, Bokashi alone/grub composting)</li>
<li>Do not turn the waste into fully useable compost (Bokashi alone)</li>
<li>Require lots of effort</li>
<li>Unattractive!</li>
</ul>
<p>In spite of all this, more and more people are starting to compost (awesome!).  The most popular method of indoor composting for average households is vermicomposting, which uses particular species of earthworms to break down kitchen waste.  The City Bin will utilize vermicomposting and has the following advantages over current models:</p>
<ul>
<li>It has a sleek, modern design that will fit in with any style of household décor.</li>
<li>It is the size of a bathroom wastebasket and can easily fit in the kitchen, bathroom, under the sink, or on a balcony.</li>

<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">My Story</span></h3>
<p>Hi family and friends, since I was a kid I’ve always had a passion for aquariums. Both of my parents had cancer growing up and, there was always an aquarium at the cancer centers. I did not realize it back then, but those aquariums not only brought me peace, but they also brought me inspiration. As I have grown older, my passion has turned into my career.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">My Dream Turned Into Reality</span></h3>
<p>As some of you may know, I have been selling aquaria online for the past year but, my goal has been to open my storefront. Just this past weekend, God blessed me with making one of my greatest dreams come true. I opened my first physical aquarium store location! </p>

Hi family and friends, since I was a kid I’ve always had a passion for aquariums. Both of my parents had cancer growing up and, there was always an aquarium at the cancer centers. I did not realize it back then, but those aquariums not only brought me peace, but they also brought me inspiration. As I have grown older, my passion has turned into my career.
 

My Dream Turned Into Reality
As some of you may know, I have been selling aquaria online for the past year but, my goal has been to open my storefront. Just this past weekend, God blessed me with making one of my greatest dreams come true. I opened my first physical aquarium store location! 
 
Aquarium Store Renovations 
I am reaching out to ask for your help in taking my vision to the next level. I will transform this space into a new and improved aquarium store. However, I will need your help with affording the renovations. Any contribution would be appreciated.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Climate change is one of the most crucial global environmental problems of mankind. Human activity increases the concentration of greenhouse gases (GHG) in the atmosphere. Searching for a way of reducing GHG emissions is a burning issue. Electricity generation is often the most prominent GHG emission category that is closely related to the economic activities of any country.</p>
<p>Nowadays renewable energy becomes popularity in different countries. States leaderships, electricity companies as private persons are interested in renewable energy, especially in solar energy. However, for the implementation of effective decisions on the development of this industry on a certain territory, it is necessary to have appropriate tools for analyzing the potential of solar energy, as well as for predicting the volumes of electricity production taking into account the main factors that have an impact on electricity generation. In addition, the availability of such software will allow assessing the level of potential reduction of GHG emissions in the practical application of solar energy.</p>
<p>The purpose of this project is to develop a universal approach, mathematical models, algorithms and software tools for spatial analysis of solar energy potential and prediction of electricity-producing amount taking into account the weather conditions; to perform numerical experiments for creation georeferenced databases for spatial analysis of solar energy potential and evaluation of electricity production amount in the future.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>To implement the project I would like to get $50,000 (fifty thousand us dollars). This cost includes website and software development, its testing, approbation and supporting, paying for using cloud technologies (servers, virtual machines, software, and others), participation in scientific conferences, traveling to the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (Laxenburg, Austria), Systems Research Institute of the Polish Academy of Sciences (Warsaw, Poland), China University of Mining and Technology (Beijing, China) or NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (Maryland, USA) to get consultation from leading scientists, publication of results in scientific journals.</p>
<p>I'm awarded a 3,0-month scholarship from the Austrian Agency for International Cooperation in Education &amp; Research (OeAD-GmbH), Centre for International Cooperation &amp; Mobility (ICM) and will carry out the research in International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (Laxenburg, Austria) from the first of February 2019 to by the thirtieth of April 2019.</p>
<p>Also, my project has been awarded a year grant (AI for Earth, Microsoft) that includes $ 10,000 in Azure credits (started on November 19, 2018).</p>
<p>This funding is a good start for my project, but it is not enough for its successful implementation.</p>
<p>In recent years, I have gained considerable practical experience in developing approaches, mathematical models and software tools for spatial analysis of greenhouse gas emissions in the energy sector (subcategory: electricity and heat production). The results of my past research are an important basis for making effective decisions on greenhouse gas emission reductions both at the state level and at the level of individual economic entities, in particular, in the power generating industry. The development of solar energy is the key to reducing emissions and improving the ecological situation on the planet. This project proposal is a logical prolongation of my previous scientific projects in terms of reducing the level of greenhouse gas emissions and allows us to solve a lot of problems that arise when developing an action plan for the development of the solar energy industry. The acquired theoretical and practical experience in previous scientific projects is the key to the successful implementation of the presented project proposal. Also, I have contacts with leading scientists of the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (Laxenburg, Austria), Systems Research Institute of the Polish Academy of Sciences (Warsaw, Poland), China University of Mining and Technology (Beijing, China) and NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (Maryland, USA), which carry out researches in the fields of greenhouse gases inventory and renewable energy. In addition to scientific institutions, I have contacts with the management of several solar and wind power plants who are interested in the future results and are ready to provide real data on a royalty-free basis for the validation of developed approaches, mathematical models and software tools. I am convinced that my practical experience of previous scientific projects, connections with leading international scientific institutions and electricity producing enterprises of the renewable energy sector will allow me to successfully fulfill all tasks of the project proposal. This project addresses the challenge of spatial analysis of solar energy potential on different levels (country, region or local level) including the main parameters that have an impact on electricity generation processes.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>In recent decades, the problem of negative climate changes has arisen. An increasing the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere of the planet tirelessly promotes the cause of an average annual temperature increasing, melting of glaciers, world ocean level rise as well as frequent and prolonged droughts. This is also evidenced by numerous studies by world-renowned scholars. As for today, humanity has put considerable effort into researching greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere of the planet and identifying sources of emissions. The energy sector, in particular, the power generation sector, produces the largest amount of greenhouse emissions. The best way to reduce them is to use renewable energy sources, in particular, solar energy, wind, water, and others. Today solar energy is dynamically developed but there are a lot of problems that must be solved for the sustainability of this branch. That's why the main focus of the proposal is on this type of renewable energy.</p>
<p>Scientists developed a lot of ways to transform solar energy into electricity, but there are parameters that affect the productivity of electricity generation. For instance, solar radiation, temperature, geographical location, cloudiness, and others. It is necessary to calculate and analyze these parameters before choosing the type of solar power station and its building. The best way to get reliable parameters is to do spatial analysis of the potential of solar energy using GIS and open source data.</p>
<p>Consequently, the development of an easy-to-use tool for spatial-distributed analysis of the potential of solar energy remains an open challenge. Such tool will provide new possibilities for solar energy potential analysis and help scientists and policymakers to find ways for the development of solar energy production and to evaluate possible financial benefits from the development of this branch in different regions.</p>
<p>The opportunity to use digital and geoinformation technologies as an important step toward helping to solve the tasks of spatial analysis of solar energy potential with automatic forming the georeferenced cadasters of solar energy potential with taking into account the main parameters that have an impact on electricity generation processes. The approach with using artificial intelligence can provide automatically building the input databases for geospatial analysis of solar energy potential and the results of computer simulation of solar energy potential distribution. The key advantages of such way to solve problems related to solar energy analysis, supporting and developing this branch are the reducing of usage manual work, low cost, take into account the main parameters of electricity generating processes (sunny, cloudy and windy days, wind speed, rain precipitations, air temperature, and others), quick results getting, an opportunity to adapt models to the new needs and features of producing circles, and others.</p>
<p>The practical value of the expected results is the ability to identify territories automatically with sufficient energy potential for the construction of power generating enterprises and forecasting potentially possible volumes of electricity production. The developed approaches based on modern digital and geoinformation technologies will serve as an effective tool for politicians and government bodies in making decisions about the allocation of limited funds for the development of solar energy power plants in the case it has the maximum effect in terms of emission reductions and will ensure the sustainable economic development of the region. In addition, the results of such research will be of interest to private investors in terms of making decisions on investing in renewable energy in the region.</p>
<p>The obtained practical experience is quite valuable and can be used in studies of the potential of another renewable energy sources at different levels and in processes of estimating and forecasting electricity production volumes using renewable sources and taking into account many factors of influence, including weather conditions and would also apply to other similar modeling challenges with using artificial intelligence, digital and geoinformation technologies.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The main risk of the proposed solution is developing the correct mathematical model and its validation. The main challenge is to identify the dependencies between all the major parameters that affect the processes of generating electricity using solar energy. Today I have already developed a draft description of the model and its main parameters. But the mathematical description of solar energy potential needs improving and deep validation. The model validation will be based on comparing the gotten results of mathematical simulation and real statistical data of the amount of electricity production from existed solar power plants. Such approach to model validation based on my past experience in spatial analysis and mathematical modeling of GHG emission in electricity and heat generation sector. Last eight years I was a team member of the research group that managed and executed different scientific projects related to spatial analysis and mathematical modeling of GHG emissions in different sectors of human activities. All activities in these projects focused on the development of approaches, mathematical models and software tools for spatial analysis and creation of databases of GHG emission in all sectors of human activities. Considerable attention was paid to the uncertainty analysis of the results and this practical experience is very important in case of successful execution the tasks of spatial analysis of solar energy potential.</p>
<p>The next risk, I think, is the creation of detailed input datasets. In this case, the main accent will be focused on open source data. For instance, a lot of valuable information related to spatial analysis of solar energy potential is provided by NASA, Google, and other companies. The approach with using digital technologies and artificial intelligence has a big advantage because it allows the researcher to train the model by using real datasets and taking into account a lot of parameters that have an impact on electricity generation processes.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I'll be very happy and very thankful for any help. Also, I'm ready to discuss any proposals and collaborations that can help me to fundraise and to implement my ideas in the framework of this project proposal. I hope that the results of my research and my project will use by all interested communities and will be very useful for everyone because we have the greatest task of all time: save the environment for the future generation.</p>

The next risk, I think, is the creation of detailed input datasets. In this case, the main accent will be focused on open source data. For instance, a lot of valuable information related to spatial analysis of solar energy potential is provided by NASA, Google, and other companies. The approach with using digital technologies and artificial intelligence has a big advantage because it allows the researcher to train the model by using real datasets and taking into account a lot of parameters that have an impact on electricity generation processes.

Other Ways You Can Help
I'll be very happy and very thankful for any help. Also, I'm ready to discuss any proposals and collaborations that can help me to fundraise and to implement my ideas in the framework of this project proposal. I hope that the results of my research and my project will use by all interested communities and will be very useful for everyone because we have the greatest task of all time: save the environment for the future generation.",0.0,0,"3 Campaigns

Tuqtuquilal is a center focused on education and is at the heart of a holistic project which aims to inspire regeneration through the development of an intentional village and wellness center. Discover more by visiting our website : http://tuqtuquilal.com Our reforestation ProgamAt Tuqtuquilal we believe that there can never be enough trees. Trees and the vast biodiversity that they nurture  reduce climate change and support healthy ecosystems, providing us with food, oxygen, and prevent soil erosion.We give you the opportunity to plant more trees today and help us make reforestation a priority  that brings hope for us all...... make a regenerative donation, sprouting life from your generosity! The ProblemHere in the valley of Lanquin in Guatemala, we can daily observe  the jungle being reduced  to make space for more monoculture, animal rearing and  construction. The removal of trees is creating many problems. First of all, it is a great loss of biodiversity as the forests host enormous amounts of life in many forms : vegetal, animal, fungus, micro-organism, etc...Deforestation also creates soil erosion, leading to soil degradation, increased flooding,  underground water reserve depletion, animal migration and the general increasing of world temperatures and disasters.Our entire world ecosystem is very dependent on its biodiversity, it is our duty to protect it for us all and for generations of people and animls to come. ! HELP US PREVENT THIS INSANITY!​We would love to keep planting more and more trees on a daily basis and dedicate 2 workers specifically for that purpose, offering them a very meaningful job and something that will help and inspire the local community and visitors for many  generations to come.More than ever we need funding to pay for local salaries and tree seedlings (we produce many on site but need to diversify species and therefore buy seeds and seedlings). The Solution :​Reforestation !!!​ We ask for a minimum of $.8 donation per tree which helps cover a salary for a local worker as well as the tree & planting.Thank you so much!After we receive a donation, the tree will usually be planted between 1 and 15 days .​We plant respecting the natural cycle of the moon and seasons as do the local farmers. Please choose among the following trees.COPAL Q'eqchi women harvesting CopalOne of the most sacred and traditional trees of Central America​The Copal resin is a powerful healer and purifier, with the power to transmute negative energy. Copal aids in physical, mental, and spiritual healing, and environmental clearing.The life force within Copal is said to promote fertility, as it is the life force and “blood” of the tree, which makes it a good incense to burn for birthing ceremonies.​We use the copal in our cooperative to craft various products like essential oil or incenses. CACAOAt least 10 million years old, a treasure of Mesoamerica,  super food, medicine and delicious treat....​"" Food of the gods"" and  an undervalued treasure for the entire world.​Cacao is not only one of the healthiest foods in the world, it's also the main ingredient to make one of the most popular treats humanity has ever discovered :CHOCOLATE!Our Criollo Cacao trees comes from the beautiful and luxuriant jungle of Guatemala and are some of the highest quality in the world. Most cacao trees in this area  are beautiful ancestral hybrids producing some of the most delicious and highest quality chocolate.The tree itself is a wonderful sub-canopy species that keep its leaves all year providing wonderful shelter for a large range of animals, as well as creating shade for ground species and feeding the soil constantly with dead leaves.​The trees will take 3 to 5 years to reach maturity and will need the help of taller shade trees like Madre Cacao or Plantain. MADRE CACAOOne of the most remarkable leguminous trees growing in the region.It is a very sturdy tree capable of growing in almost any kind of damaged soil. It grows very quickly offering it's shade to sub-canopy species and lots of falling leaves for soil health.​It is often used to prepare and nurture a new cacao field as the cacao trees need shade to grow and it is a nitrogen fixer, supplying this nutrient to the cacao, and hence gets it´s name  :Madre de Cacao (cacao mother). PLANTAINEven though Plantain is a grass and not a tree we decided to offer it here, as it is a fantastic and very useful crop.​It is a quick growing crop that produces very sustainable food (ripe plantain is rich in vitamins, fibers & antioxidants,) while the unripe plantain is lower in sugar, more starchy and allows for the production of flour.​The plantain leaves have also many uses (for the fermentation of cacao or mulching for example) as well as its ""trunk"" (which is a wonderful resource for many permaculture applications).​It also grows pretty tall and therefore creates very useful shade and attracts the flies that pollinate the cacao. OAKOne of the most loved trees in the world, and with good reason.It’s a symbol of strength, morale, resistance and knowledge. ​The oak is considered a cosmic storehouse of wisdom embodied in its towering strength.​Symbolism aside, Oak trees are important for a number of reasons.It’s a long-lived tree which can live more than 1000 years and have multiple uses:the boiled bark has therapeutic properties.Its fruit (acorn) is used to feed livestock and in times of shortage has also been used for human consumption.​Amazing for any kind of construction or craft. For both practical purpose or art. CEDARAnother wonderful tropical permaculture pioneer species and valuable timberwood.​Cedar is a beautiful hardwood largely used in construction all over the world. MAHOGANY / CAOBARelatively fast growing. Caoba is a very good hard wood.Very useful and valuable as construction material, its high stature and strong roots makes it very helpful to create a top canopy roof and help prevent erosion as well as reducing undesired winds BAMBOOAnother tree which is in fact a grass... bamboo is another wonder of nature. Fast growing and with a really strong root system, bamboo can be used in construction, to prevent erosion, or create natural fences.​It grows really tall and providse a very nice a fresh shade as well as covering the ground with its ever falling leaves. TEKOne of the most sort after hard woods in the world. COCONUTAnd the last but not the least...World superstar...The coconut tree needs no introduction!It is resilient, slow growing but carries a high yield of fruits when mature:​The flesh and water content of the coconut are delicious and nutritious but also allows the production of coconut oil used in many applications and products. Thank you for your help & please visit soon! -- ESPAÑOL --El Proyecto TuqtuquilalQue significa 'Armonía' en Q'eqchi Maya. Es un Centro de Impacto ubicado en la exuberante jungla de Lanquín, Alta Verapaz, Guatemala, en 56 acres de tierra fértil, pero parcialmente degenerada. Tuqtuquilal es un centro enfocado en la educación y está en el corazón de un proyecto holístico que tiene como objetivo inspirar la regeneración a través del desarrollo de un pueblo intencional y un centro de bienestar Puede conocer más visitando nuestro sitio web: http://tuqtuquilal.com Nuestro programa de reforestaciónEn Tuqtuquilal creemos que nunca hay suficientes árboles.Los árboles y la vasta biodiversidad que nutren reducen el cambio climático y apoyan ecosistemas saludables, proporcionándonos alimentos, oxígeno y evitando la erosión del suelo.Te damos la oportunidad de plantar más árboles hoy y ayúdanos a hacer de la reforestación una prioridad que nos brinde esperanza a todos ... ¡haz una donación regenerativa, brotando vida de tu generosidad!  El problemaAquí en el valle de Lanquín en Guatemala, podemos observar diariamente cómo la selva se reduce para dar lugar a más monocultivos, cría de animales y construcción.La tala de árboles está creando muchos problemas. En primer lugar, es una gran pérdida de biodiversidad ya que los bosques albergan enormes cantidades de vida en muchas formas: vegetal, animal, hongos, microorganismos, etc.La deforestación también crea erosión del suelo, lo que lleva a la degradación del suelo, aumento de las inundaciones, agotamiento de las reservas de agua subterránea, migración de animales y el aumento general de la temperatura mundial y los desastres.Todo nuestro ecosistema mundial depende en gran medida de su biodiversidad, es nuestro deber protegerlo para todos nosotros y para las generaciones de personas y animales venideros.¡AYÚDANOS A PREVENIR ESTA LOCURA!Nos encantaría seguir plantando más y más árboles a diario y dedicar 2 trabajadores específicamente para ese propósito, ofreciéndoles un trabajo muy significativo y algo que ayudará e inspirará a la comunidad local y a los visitantes durante muchas generaciones por venir.Más que nunca necesitamos fondos para pagar los salarios locales y las plántulas de árboles (producimos muchas en el sitio, pero necesitamos diversificar las especies y, por lo tanto, comprar semillas y plántulas).  La solución :Reforestación !!!We ask for a minimum of $.8 donation per tree which helps cover a salary for a local worker as well as the tree & planting.Thank you so much!After we receive a donation, the tree will usually be planted between 1 and 15 days .​We plant respecting the natural cycle of the moon and seasons as do the local farmers. Le ofrecemos elegir entre los siguientes árboles. COPALMujeres q'eqchi cosechando CopalUno de los árboles más sagrados y tradicionales de CentroaméricaLa resina de Copal es un poderoso sanador y purificador, con el poder de transmutar la energía negativa. Copal ayuda en la curación física, mental y espiritual, y en la limpieza ambiental.Se dice que la fuerza vital dentro de Copal promueve la fertilidad, ya que es la fuerza vital y la ""sangre"" del árbol, lo que lo convierte en un buen incienso para quemar en las ceremonias de nacimiento.Usamos el copal en nuestra cooperativa para elaborar diversos productos como aceite esencial o inciensos. CACAOAl menos 10 millones de años, un tesoro de Mesoamérica, súper comida, medicina y deliciosa golosina ....Una vez comida de los dioses y hoy en día un tesoro infravalorado para el mundo entero.El cacao no solo es uno de los alimentos más saludables del mundo, también es el ingrediente principal para hacer una de las golosinas más populares que la humanidad haya descubierto:¡CHOCOLATE!Nuestros árboles de Cacao Criollo provienen de la hermosa y exuberante selva de Guatemala y son algunos de los de más alta calidad originados en Guatemala. La mayoría de los árboles de cacao en esta área son hermosos híbridos ancestrales que producen algunos de los cacao más deliciosos que se pueden encontrar en el mundo.El árbol en sí es una maravillosa especie de subdosel que mantiene sus hojas todo el año proporcionando un refugio maravilloso para una gran variedad de animales, además de dar sombra a las especies terrestres y alimentar el suelo constantemente con hojas muertas.Los árboles tardarán de 3 a 5 años en alcanzar la madurez y necesitarán la ayuda de árboles de sombra más altos como Madre Cacao o Plátano. MADRE CACAOUno de los árboles leguminosos más notables que crecen por aquí.Es un árbol muy robusto capaz de crecer en casi cualquier tipo de suelo dañado. Crece muy rápido y crece alto mientras se extiende ampliamente, ofreciendo sombra a las especies del sub-dosel y muchas hojas que caen para que el suelo se acumule.Muy a menudo se usa para preparar un nuevo campo de cacao ya que el árbol del cacao necesita sombra para crecer y de ahí tomó su nombre: Madre de Cacao (madre del cacao).También es un fuerte fijador de nitrógeno y muy útil en la construcción. PLÁTANOAunque el plátano es una hierba y no un árbol. Decidimos ofrecerlo aquí de todos modos, ya que es un cultivo fantástico y muy útil.Es un cultivo de crecimiento rápido que produce alimentos muy sostenibles (el plátano maduro es rico en vitaminas, fibras, antioxidantes, etc ...) mientras que el plátano verde es más bajo en azúcar, más almidonado y permite la producción de harina.Las hojas de plátano también tienen muchos usos (para la fermentación del cacao o como mantillo, por ejemplo), así como su ""tronco"" (que es un recurso maravilloso para muchas aplicaciones de permacultura).También crece bastante alto y, por lo tanto, crea una sombra muy útil. ROBLE ENCINOProbablemente los árboles más queridos del mundo, y con razón.Es un símbolo de fuerza, moral, resistencia y conocimiento.El roble se considera un depósito cósmico de sabiduría encarnada en su imponente fuerza.Crece lentamente, pero seguramente a su propio ritmo. El roble a menudo se asocia con el honor, la nobleza y la sabiduría gracias a su tamaño y longevidad.Dejando a un lado el simbolismo, los robles son importantes por varias razones.Es un árbol longevo que puede vivir más de 1000 años y tiene múltiples usos:la corteza hervida tiene propiedades terapéuticas.Su fruto (bellota) se utiliza para la alimentación del ganado y en épocas de escasez también se ha utilizado para el consumo humano.Increíble para cualquier tipo de construcción o artesanía. Tanto para fines prácticos como art.Los robles pueden vivir fácilmente durante siglos CEDROOtra maravillosa especie pionera de la permacultura tropical y valiosa madera maderable.El cedro es una hermosa madera dura que se utiliza principalmente en la construcción en todo el mundo. CAOBA / CAOBADe crecimiento relativamente rápido. Caoba es una madera dura muy buena.Muy útil y valioso como material de construcción, su alta estatura y raíces fuertes lo hacen muy útil para crear un techo de dosel superior y ayudar a prevenir la erosión, así como a reducir los vientos no deseados. BAMBUOtro árbol que de hecho es una hierba ... bambou es otra maravilla de la naturaleza.De crecimiento relativamente rápido y con un sistema de raíces realmente fuerte, el bambou puede usarse para prevenir la erosión o crear cercas naturales.Crece muy alto y proporciona una sombra fresca muy agradable, además de cubrir el suelo con sus hojas siempre caídas.No hace falta decir que es uno de los materiales de construcción más asombrosos y versátiles que podemos usar en la jungla, ¡así que nunca tendríamos demasiado! TEKUna de las maderas duras más cuidadas del mundo.Ese hermoso árbol es un cultivo valioso a largo plazo que puede tardar un tiempo en crecer, pero proporcionará una recuperación considerable en el futuro. COCOY el último pero no menos importante ...Superestrella mundial ...¡El cocotero no necesita presentación!Es resistente, de crecimiento lento, pero produce un alto rendimiento de frutos cuando está maduro:La carne y el contenido de agua del coco son deliciosos y nutritivos, pero lo más importante es que permite la producción de aceite de coco.Uno de los mejores aceites para usar en cualquier aplicación. ¡Muchas gracias por tu ayuda!",26.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>While lions, rhinos, and elephants gain mainstream attention in African conservation, there are thousands of species that go unnoticed and unstudied, leaving conservationists with no information on which to base conservation efforts. Unfortunately, this is the case with the Saddlebill Stork (Ephippiorhynchus senegalensis), which has been poorly studied. Even with a lack of data, conservationists have assumed Saddlebills are not threatened, which has resulted in low research priority. New research by this team, however, has found that Saddlebills are not as widespread as has been assumed; and that they are mostly confined to national parks.</p>
<p>As a young ecologist I have become concerned about the implications of this narrative and have made it my career goal to fill scientific knowledge gaps to better inform conservation of overlooked species. The story of this project perfectly demonstrates how science should work: I observed Saddlebill Storks in Zambia, asked questions about them, and designed a study to answer those questions. But it also demonstrates how conservation should NOT work: it has a large geographic range, people see it in many places since it's conspicuous, so conservationists assumed it's unthreatened and made up a number for the population size.</p>
<p>While doing carnivore research in Zambia, I saw the Saddlebill and the mystery surrounding it as an opportunity to (1) answer questions for conserving the species and (2) show how the current approach to assessing conservation status can be very inappropriate. I knew it would be an uphill journey to start a field-based project in Africa from scratch, but I was determined. Over the course of two years and three jobs, I realized the Saddlebill could also be used as an umbrella wetland species, which essentially means it could act as a representative for other wildlife with which it shares its wetland habitat. Therefore, by conserving the Saddlebill and its habitat, you would also be positively affecting hundreds of other species. </p>
<p>Against all odds, the logistical and financial challenges of the project were tackled during the two years following inception thanks to the support of many, especially African Bird Club and Texas State University. In June 2019 we had our first field season in which our primary goal was to put GPS tracking units of five Saddlebills for the first time ever. However, the coincidental timing of the worst drought in 40 years meant very few storks were left in the study area in Liuwa Plain National Park, Zambia. The lack of water from the drought also resulted in significant fishing pressure from local people, which caused prey depletion and direct disturbance of the storks. As a result, we only captured one stork and managed to deploy the first tracking unit ever put on a Saddlebill.</p>
<p>Now that we can better anticipate the challenges in the field, we hope to return to Liuwa Plain in December 2019 to capture four more Saddlebills and deploy tracking units. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The rains will return to Liuwa Plain National Park in November, which means storks will return and a fishing ban will go into effect in December. December will provide the ideal opportunity to deploy the remaining GPS units on four different Saddlebills. In order to make this happen, we need to raise $4,000 for the expenses associated with returning to the field in Zambia. This will include flights, fuel, camp, and supplies. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, research grants and other funding opportunities are not an option for us because December is so near. So that means we're really counting on the generosity of people who recognize the value of this research! As a thank you to those who donate, we will provide the following perks:</p>
<p>      $100: a beautiful Saddlebill Stork t-shirt from RedBubble.com<br/>      $500: 12""x16"" canvas print of your choice from my photo website<br/>      $1,000: name one of the storks we capture and see where it moves!</p>
<p>Without your support in reaching our funding goal, we won't be able to deploy the remaining four GPS units on Saddlebills, so please share with friends and family!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>By contributing to this project, you are contributing to brand new research that has never been done previously! And, in turn, you are advancing conservation efforts for a charismatic yet neglected species in Africa. By supporting research on Saddlebills, you're supporting conservation of dozens of other wetland species with which storks share their habitat.</p>
<p>Wetlands in Africa -and around the world- are threatened by degradation from damming and pollution, overfishing, and abusive water use. Now more than ever it is critical to understand the ecology of freshwater ecosystems for protecting wildlife and people whose lives rely on these water sources.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Field research is risky, especially in the challenging conditions of western Zambia. One obvious risk is the possibility of not capturing any storks. Now that we know what we're doing as far as techniques, I'm confident this won't be an issue. A second risk is that the tracking units we deploy don't work properly. This is always a possibility when working with technology, especially in rough conditions. The units operate using cell phone towers, so it is likely there will be long periods between data downloads -but don't fear, they will transmit data eventually! These challenges and risks are probably one reason no one has attempted this work before -but that makes the outcome all the more exciting and significant!</p>
<p>One alternative to the tracking units we use are GPS-satellite devices, which communicate locations rapidly on a predetermined schedule. These units are much more expensive -about $4,000 USD each- and requires a $30 USD monthly fee for the satellite service. If anyone is interested in sponsoring one of these units to minimize the risks associated with our cellular units, please let us know!</p>

<h2 align=""center""><em><strong>Twiceys</strong></em></h2>
<h2 align=""center""><em><strong>One t-shirt</strong></em></h2>
<h2 align=""center""><em><strong>Two missions</strong></em></h2>
<p> </p>
<h2>Mission # 1</h2>
<p> Twiceys' mission is to create a good product that helps to raise awareness of how we can make a difference in our environment through small changes in our daily lives. Those changes will be shown in our t-shirts with fun and simple designs.</p>
<h2>How it works:</h2>
<p>Yes!, I ride my bike to work a couple of days a week! Or, I had changed the incandescent bulbs for CFL ones! And there you have the T-shirt that shows your effort in that direction and in numbers, how your carbon foot-print have become greener. And for those conscious consumers of T-shirts, this is a t-shirt that speaks sustainability by itself!</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Our ""inaugural year"" Twicey!</h2>
<p>This is the limited edition twicey that was created combinating 4 easy changes. This 4 changes would make us release 10 tons less of CO2 to the atmosphere.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.twiceys.com/uploads/1/3/4/0/13404710/6687162_orig.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<h2>                          Beyond the T-shirt</h2>
<p> </p>
<h2>Mission # 2</h2>
<p>With the sale of each T-shirt, we'll make a concrete change in a kid's life!</p>
<p>From the beginning, we plan to fix a real need in an organization or individual.</p>
<p>We are going to call those  ""fixings"", <em><strong>Twiceys actions</strong>. When the need is cover, we'll move to another Twiceys action. Not all the needs are the same so we decided to be flexible. Some kids could need food, others could need winter clothing or shoes. </em></p>
<h2>                       </h2>
<h2>                          1st. Twicey action!</h2>
<p>We are happy to announce that we have recently became “<strong>padrinos.” </strong> In Argentina, where we are originally from, ""padrino"" is a word used to show  when a friend or family member picks you as the best person to give tender loving care for your niece, nephew, o good friend’s kid, etc. in case of their absence or lack of sources).</p>
<p>Through APAER a non-profit organization in Argentina which connects rural schools in need with people commited to mae a difference, we have become <strong>padrinos</strong> of a Jardin de Infantes (Kindergarten) in a rural isolated part of our dear Argentina, Province of Chaco.</p>
<p>The <em>Jardincito</em> -this is the way the teacher likes to call the place- consists of 24 children (13 girls and 11 boys) from 3 to 5 years old. The kids come from families with several brothers and sisters and are in great need.</p>
<p> The school has electricity and the building is in good shape in comparison with others schools in the area. It does not have running water and must rely on a nearby well, with no pump, so a bucket brings the water up, like in our old days. They need basic Kindergartners material (coloring books, color pencils, etc). In this inaugural year we will be dedicated to address the basic needs of those kids (food, clothing and educational material).</p>
<p>Perhaps the priority for us now is providing regular meals for the children.  The school provides two meals per day (breakfast and lunch) and most of the children rely on these meals as their primary source of nutrition. <strong>*18 of the 24 kindergarteners are at risk of malnutrition.</strong></p>
<p>Here comes Twiceys again, through the sale of Twiceys T-shirts, and eventually other accessories in the future, we plan to make an impact into these Kindergarteners lives, the teacher, their family and that rural community at large.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>How we’ll do it</h2>
<p>We will build a set donation into the cost of the product:</p>
<h3> The sale of <strong>one T-shirt</strong> will provide 20 school meals***</h3>
<p>Then through social media, events, etc. we will dedicate our time to let everybody know our story, and how buying a T-shirt you can be part of something bigger and meaningful as changing the lives of those kids in need.</p>
<h2>Who We are:</h2>
<p>            <img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.twiceys.com/uploads/1/3/4/0/13404710/1371578689.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We are a husband and wife team, farm managers at Peacehaven Community Farm in Whitsett NC, where we grow vegetables and community ties, and also the owners of a mini farm-based business called The Farm Fairy. Because our love for growing things, our advocacy for local economies, local food, the environment and the need -like Blake Mycoskie founder of TOMS states- to start something that matters, we have embarked on a dream of having a business with a double purpose.</p>
<h2>Our Logo: The guanacos</h2>
<p>The guanacos are the wild relatives of the llama, like camels without a hump. They inhabit the arid and semiarid habitats in Argentina where they have their biggest population.</p>
<p>To survive in harsh, dry climates, guanacos have a remarkable ability to conserve water and can obtain moisture from the plants they eat.</p>
<p>They are like the magicians of survival in such harsh environments and because of that particular treat; have inspired us to use it in our logo: two “chulengos” (baby guanacos) looking at different directions and forming a T (for Twiceys) with our beautiful Argentinean landscape in the back.</p>

One t-shirt
Two missions
 
Mission # 1
 Twiceys' mission is to create a good product that helps to raise awareness of how we can make a difference in our environment through small changes in our daily lives. Those changes will be shown in our t-shirts with fun and simple designs.
How it works:
Yes!, I ride my bike to work a couple of days a week! Or, I had changed the incandescent bulbs for CFL ones! And there you have the T-shirt that shows your effort in that direction and in numbers, how your carbon foot-print have become greener. And for those conscious consumers of T-shirts, this is a t-shirt that speaks sustainability by itself!
 
Our ""inaugural year"" Twicey!
This is the limited edition twicey that was created combinating 4 easy changes. This 4 changes would make us release 10 tons less of CO2 to the atmosphere.

                       
 
                          Beyond the T-shirt
 
Mission # 2
With the sale of each T-shirt, we'll make a concrete change in a kid's life!
From the beginning, we plan to fix a real need in an organization or individual.
We are going to call those  ""fixings"", Twiceys actions. When the need is cover, we'll move to another Twiceys action. Not all the needs are the same so we decided to be flexible. Some kids could need food, others could need winter clothing or shoes. 
                       
                          1st. Twicey action!
We are happy to announce that we have recently became “padrinos.”  In Argentina, where we are originally from, ""padrino"" is a word used to show  when a friend or family member picks you as the best person to give tender loving care for your niece, nephew, o good friend’s kid, etc. in case of their absence or lack of sources).
Through APAER a non-profit organization in Argentina which connects rural schools in need with people commited to mae a difference, we have become padrinos of a Jardin de Infantes (Kindergarten) in a rural isolated part of our dear Argentina, Province of Chaco.
The Jardincito -this is the way the teacher likes to call the place- consists of 24 children (13 girls and 11 boys) from 3 to 5 years old. The kids come from families with several brothers and sisters and are in great need.
 The school has electricity and the building is in good shape in comparison with others schools in the area. It does not have running water and must rely on a nearby well, with no pump, so a bucket brings the water up, like in our old days. They need basic Kindergartners material (coloring books, color pencils, etc). In this inaugural year we will be dedicated to address the basic needs of those kids (food, clothing and educational material).
Perhaps the priority for us now is providing regular meals for the children.  The school provides two meals per day (breakfast and lunch) and most of the children rely on these meals as their primary source of nutrition. *18 of the 24 kindergarteners are at risk of malnutrition.
Here comes Twiceys again, through the sale of Twiceys T-shirts, and eventually other accessories in the future, we plan to make an impact into these Kindergarteners lives, the teacher, their family and that rural community at large.
 
How we’ll do it
We will build a set donation into the cost of the product:
 The sale of one T-shirt will provide 20 school meals***
Then through social media, events, etc. we will dedicate our time to let everybody know our story, and how buying a T-shirt you can be part of something bigger and meaningful as changing the lives of those kids in need.
Who We are:
            
We are a husband and wife team, farm managers at Peacehaven Community Farm in Whitsett NC, where we grow vegetables and community ties, and also the owners of a mini farm-based business called The Farm Fairy. Because our love for growing things, our advocacy for local economies, local food, the environment and the need -like Blake Mycoskie founder of TOMS states- to start something that matters, we have embarked on a dream of having a business with a double purpose.
Our Logo: The guanacos
The guanacos are the wild relatives of the llama, like camels without a hump. They inhabit the arid and semiarid habitats in Argentina where they have their biggest population.
To survive in harsh, dry climates, guanacos have a remarkable ability to conserve water and can obtain moisture from the plants they eat.
They are like the magicians of survival in such harsh environments and because of that particular treat; have inspired us to use it in our logo: two “chulengos” (baby guanacos) looking at different directions and forming a T (for Twiceys) with our beautiful Argentinean landscape in the back.
 
Our best Ally
The Cotton of the Carolinas
T-shirts
 
  
Twiceys Cotton of the Carolinas T-shirts

Nothing can beat the transparency of this product!
 
For our project to hatch we need your help!
 
Twiceys has started as a need to put words into actions and for that we will need a little push, we need to raise some money and that is the reason we are here in Indiegogo.
The funds from this Indiegogo project go to:
-Raise money to call for 4 contests among graphic designers in order to have our first 4 designs ready to print in our new line of shirts.
-Raise capital for shirt production: our goal amount enables us to order the minimum number of shirts per color to get the best possible bulk price break. 
-Printing a run of stickers
With this inventory, we’ll be prepared to approach the world outside! 
Of course the more support we get, the more we can make and the more we can help others. Every additional support beyond our goal will go towards more designs and additional T-shirts.
 
Keep in mind that this campaign is all-or-nothing. If we don't reach the goal we don't get any money (all the money goes back to the founders, you).
Even when the money is not released until the last day, the sooner we reach the goal the better.

<p>The Alberta Tar Sands are possibly the most environmentally significant site of our time: a symbolic battleground in the fight for the future of our planet against climate change; a violation of the rights of indigenous people; a threat to one of the oldest, most robust and diverse ecosystems in the world: the boreal rain forest. On July 5th - 6th, First Nations tribes and Canadian activists will walk alongside the Tar Sands with a message of peace, compassion and healing. We're raising money to see that NYC is there walking along with them. </p>
<p>As Brooklyn-based climate justice activists, we've organized buses for this year's Forward On Climate rally in Washington, D.C, contributed writing to the Sierra Club NYC blog and helped launch a fossil fuel divestment campaign for the CUNY university system. This new campaign, the Tar Sands Healing Walk - NYC Contingent, is a way for New Yorkers concerned about climate change and environmental injustice to show a concrete form of solidarity with the frontline community that is taking the toxic brunt of the Tar Sands.  </p>
<p>Your donation will enable four activists to travel by car from New York to Fort McMurray, Alberta, CN - a 5,000 mile roundtrip trek - to walk alongside First Nations, Metis and Inuit people in the annual Tar Sands Healing Walk. Using social media throughout our journey, we aim to raise awareness about the injustices of the Tar Sands and to inspire the NYC community to intensify their own commitment to the movement to stop climate change. Upon returning to NYC, we will host a presentation to report-back to the community all that we saw and experienced. </p>
<p>We hope to raise $1,500 (or more) to help us offset the rental cost for a hybrid vehicle, fuel fill-ups, food, tolls and other miscellaneous travel expenses. For a donation of $10, we will write you a personalized tweet of thanks for your contribution. For a donation of $30, we will send you a personalized postcard from a destination en route to the Tar Sands. For $50, we will make you a big jar of delicious, organic maple-coconut granola. For a donation of $100 - $300, you can have a private 45-minute concert in your very own home by climate/folk singer-songwriter, San Joaquin. For $300 - $400, Galicia, one of the activists riding with us, will perform a fire poi show! For a donation of $500 or more, you get a free 2-hour surf lesson by me, long-time surfer and former ocean lifeguard, AND get to hang out at a beautiful East Hampton beach all day on a Saturday or a Sunday this summer or fall, your choice.  <strong> </strong></p>
<p>The <a href=""http://www.healingwalk.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Tar Sands Healing Walk</a> is a unique nonviolent direct action organized by<a href=""http://www.keepersofthewater.ca/athabasca"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> Keepers of the Athabasca</a>, and is not like other political rallies. Participants are asked not to raise signs or wave banners, but rather to bear witness to the beauty and power of the land, and to stand in peace and compassion before the heinous environmental crimes that are the tar sands mining and processing sites. </p>
<p>With your donation, you are helping to build real connections between New York City climate activists and Canadian First Nations people who have been suffering for decades at the hands of powerful fossil fuel corporations. The experiences we share with the local community of the Athabasca river basin, we in turn share with our network of NYC activists, which in turn reinvigorates our efforts here in New York to stop climate change; to stop the building of natural gas pipelines; to divest our universities' and other institutional endowments from fossil fuel stocks; to promote the advancement of carbon-free energy and modes of sustainable living; to fight for equitable disaster preparedness and relief. Every facet of the work we do as climate activists is enhanced by making contact with the Tar Sands and by sharing in the struggles of the front-line community there. </p>

<p><strong><em>What is <em>PeTrak?</em></em></strong></p>
<p><strong>PeTrak is a GPS based electronic pet fencing system.</strong>  By employing the Global Positioning System it is the only fencing product that utilizes a true positioning technology that, in concert with the latest sensors, a powerful microprocessor, and proprietary software, results in a revolutionary improvement over existing fencing products. Everything about PeTrak, from the basic concept and hardware to the custom software, was driven by our desire to create the most reliable and versatile pet fence possible. Although you may have seen one of the many so called GPS pet trackers in recent years those are not fencing systems and they are fraught with problems. See the section below on all competitive products.</p>
<p>In the past the most popular fencing system was the <strong>buried wire fence</strong> invented way back in the mid 70's. They employed proximity sensing and were very effective at keeping your pet within a boundary created by burying a wire in the ground. However, if your dog decided to ""<em>run through</em>"" the boundary all control was lost and your dog was free to run as far and for as long as it wanted. Worse yet all buried wire fences actually <strong><em>prevent </em></strong>your pet from returning to your yard since they cannot distinguish which side of the fence the dog is actually on. <strong>Wireless fences</strong> (based on detecting a radio signal) were never very successful being limited to a small circle and having to be centered where the controller could be plugged into a power outlet. They also lose control after a run through and then shut down until the customer re-initializes the controller and collar. The new <strong>WiFi fences</strong> are based on the communication protocol that allows us to use our laptop computers at local coffee shops.  They are expensive, complicated to set up, and have a limited effective range after a run through. </p>
<p>From your pet's point of view PeTrak operates in a similar manner discouraging your pet from leaving the boundary that is established around your property. So far it sounds like most of the other fencing products.  This was deliberate on our part so that any of these other systems could easily be replaced with PeTrak.  However the similarities end there.  As a do-it-yourself (DIY) project PeTrak allows a pet owner to create a virtual boundary around their yard using only the PeTrak collar and a clip-on Programming Fixture that comes with every unit. Simply by walking that boundary and pausing briefly at every vertex (anywhere the boundary changes directions, indicated by those yellow arrows in the illustration below) and pushing a button on the Programming Fixture you can create a fence. You can alter your fence in the future or, if you move, you can create an entirely new one at your new home.  You can conveniently use your PeTrak fence at other locations. Whether you set up PeTrak yourself, or utilize the services of one of our professional dealers,<strong>there are no controllers to install, wires to bury, costly trenching, driveway cutting, or obstacles that are impassable.  Most importantly, PeTrak never loses control.</strong></p>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/021/775/353ddada4e5d0a7929389a5c637e5ad3_large.jpg?1339181762"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<p><strong>How Does It Work?</strong></p>
<p>PeTrak utilizes the Global Positioning Satellite system, or GPS, to create a virtual fence and monitor the position and activity of your pet. Is that all there is to it? Hardly, and we have five years of work, two patents and four pending patent applications to prove it. Selecting GPS was the easy part, how and what to do with the position and velocity data is something else entirely. But basically, once a fence is created the collar keeps track of your pet (so we call it <strong><em>PeTrak</em></strong>) and its activity. The only time the collar is fully active is when it determines that your pet will leave the boundary within a specific time limit. That’s because PeTrak is not a proximity fence like most others. What is important is not how close your pet is to the boundary but rather how fast he or she may be moving towards it. If a breach is imminent, then the collar will warn first and only correct if necessary. If a breach should occur PeTrak is the only fencing system that never loses control or shuts down. PeTrak switches from the normal fencing protocol to an advanced algorithm that tracks, monitors and reacts to your pet's <em>behavior</em> to slow it down and safely return it to the boundary.</p>
<p><strong><em>No other fence keeps working to keep your pet safe and return it to your yard.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Second Programmable Boundary</strong></p>
<p>PeTrak is capable of storing a secondary boundary that you can program as easily as the first using the Programming Fixture.  If you have a vacation home or often take your dog to grandma's house you can create a boundary there in addition to the one at home.  PeTrak will automatically recognize  either boundary when activated within it.     What could be easier or more convenient?</p>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/021/746/cae2a60e3571a82d82c1b639f9a8c324_large.jpg?1339180922"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<p><strong>Park Zone</strong></p>
<p>We created the <strong><em>Park Zone</em></strong> function for use anywhere you might want to let your dog run, but now without worrying if he will stray too far.  The boundary is circular and you can quickly set the size.  Using the Key Fob you set the boundary center where you're standing.  Then set the size in 50 foot increments.  It's as easy as that!</p>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/021/748/056521203354d84f3e7b0bf59fbc1ced_large.jpg?1339180986"" src="""" style=""""/></div>

<p><strong>Where Are We Today?</strong></p>
<p>Our first two patents have been granted.  With another four pending applications our intellectual property is well protected. Several working models, one of which is pictured below, have been tested and performed extremely well. The next step is  completing the industrial engineering; designing the various plastic parts, ordering production tooling, and reducing the circuit board from prototype size (shown below) to production size.   The size reduction will make it comfortable and easy for a pet to wear.  PeTrak will be the same size and lighter than competitive buried wire fences.</p>

<p><strong>How Will The Funds Be Used?</strong></p>
<p>With your support, funds will be used for the work described above, to purchase tooling and other capital equipment, continue our patent work, and to put PeTrak into production and take it to market. Our local manufacturer in Pennsylvania is ready to produce the electronics and assemble early production. A large turnkey manufacturer in New York will produce our products in high volume, packaged and ready to ship.  We are looking for a second source manufacturer in the Carolina's and are talking with a plastics manufacturer in New Jersey to source both tooling and injection molded parts. </p>

</div></div>","What is PeTrak?
PeTrak is a GPS based electronic pet fencing system.  By employing the Global Positioning System it is the only fencing product that utilizes a true positioning technology that, in concert with the latest sensors, a powerful microprocessor, and proprietary software, results in a revolutionary improvement over existing fencing products. Everything about PeTrak, from the basic concept and hardware to the custom software, was driven by our desire to create the most reliable and versatile pet fence possible. Although you may have seen one of the many so called GPS pet trackers in recent years those are not fencing systems and they are fraught with problems. See the section below on all competitive products.
In the past the most popular fencing system was the buried wire fence invented way back in the mid 70's. They employed proximity sensing and were very effective at keeping your pet within a boundary created by burying a wire in the ground. However, if your dog decided to ""run through"" the boundary all control was lost and your dog was free to run as far and for as long as it wanted. Worse yet all buried wire fences actually prevent your pet from returning to your yard since they cannot distinguish which side of the fence the dog is actually on. Wireless fences (based on detecting a radio signal) were never very successful being limited to a small circle and having to be centered where the controller could be plugged into a power outlet. They also lose control after a run through and then shut down until the customer re-initializes the controller and collar. The new WiFi fences are based on the communication protocol that allows us to use our laptop computers at local coffee shops.  They are expensive, complicated to set up, and have a limited effective range after a run through. 
From your pet's point of view PeTrak operates in a similar manner discouraging your pet from leaving the boundary that is established around your property. So far it sounds like most of the other fencing products.  This was deliberate on our part so that any of these other systems could easily be replaced with PeTrak.  However the similarities end there.  As a do-it-yourself (DIY) project PeTrak allows a pet owner to create a virtual boundary around their yard using only the PeTrak collar and a clip-on Programming Fixture that comes with every unit. Simply by walking that boundary and pausing briefly at every vertex (anywhere the boundary changes directions, indicated by those yellow arrows in the illustration below) and pushing a button on the Programming Fixture you can create a fence. You can alter your fence in the future or, if you move, you can create an entirely new one at your new home.  You can conveniently use your PeTrak fence at other locations. Whether you set up PeTrak yourself, or utilize the services of one of our professional dealers,there are no controllers to install, wires to bury, costly trenching, driveway cutting, or obstacles that are impassable.  Most importantly, PeTrak never loses control.

How Does It Work?
PeTrak utilizes the Global Positioning Satellite system, or GPS, to create a virtual fence and monitor the position and activity of your pet. Is that all there is to it? Hardly, and we have five years of work, two patents and four pending patent applications to prove it. Selecting GPS was the easy part, how and what to do with the position and velocity data is something else entirely. But basically, once a fence is created the collar keeps track of your pet (so we call it PeTrak) and its activity. The only time the collar is fully active is when it determines that your pet will leave the boundary within a specific time limit. That’s because PeTrak is not a proximity fence like most others. What is important is not how close your pet is to the boundary but rather how fast he or she may be moving towards it. If a breach is imminent, then the collar will warn first and only correct if necessary. If a breach should occur PeTrak is the only fencing system that never loses control or shuts down. PeTrak switches from the normal fencing protocol to an advanced algorithm that tracks, monitors and reacts to your pet's behavior to slow it down and safely return it to the boundary.
No other fence keeps working to keep your pet safe and return it to your yard.
Second Programmable Boundary
PeTrak is capable of storing a secondary boundary that you can program as easily as the first using the Programming Fixture.  If you have a vacation home or often take your dog to grandma's house you can create a boundary there in addition to the one at home.  PeTrak will automatically recognize  either boundary when activated within it.     What could be easier or more convenient?

Park Zone
We created the Park Zone function for use anywhere you might want to let your dog run, but now without worrying if he will stray too far.  The boundary is circular and you can quickly set the size.  Using the Key Fob you set the boundary center where you're standing.  Then set the size in 50 foot increments.  It's as easy as that!


Where Are We Today?
Our first two patents have been granted.  With another four pending applications our intellectual property is well protected. Several working models, one of which is pictured below, have been tested and performed extremely well. The next step is  completing the industrial engineering; designing the various plastic parts, ordering production tooling, and reducing the circuit board from prototype size (shown below) to production size.   The size reduction will make it comfortable and easy for a pet to wear.  PeTrak will be the same size and lighter than competitive buried wire fences.



How Will The Funds Be Used?
With your support, funds will be used for the work described above, to purchase tooling and other capital equipment, continue our patent work, and to put PeTrak into production and take it to market. Our local manufacturer in Pennsylvania is ready to produce the electronics and assemble early production. A large turnkey manufacturer in New York will produce our products in high volume, packaged and ready to ship.  We are looking for a second source manufacturer in the Carolina's and are talking with a plastics manufacturer in New Jersey to source both tooling and injection molded parts. 
Below are selected pages from our Competitive Analysis.





 
PeTrak Dealers
For those interested to become authorized dealers we have designed and patented a unique set of tools to facilitate the design and programming of a custom boundary layout which can be viewed on a map or satellite image of the customer's property.  The Self Survey Stakes shown below automatically generate the most accurate boundary data possible while you perform the dog training sessions.  We will also teach you our proprietary low stress training method.  Your time on the job is dramatically lower than with buried wire systems as is your startup cost.  Best of all will be your customer's overall satisfaction and the referrals that will come with it.

<p>Hello internet community! First of all THANK YOU so much for taking the time to read this! My name is Sarah Curtis. I am 34 years old and live in Salt Lake City, Utah. My goal is to raise enough funding to go and pursue my life’s dream of becoming a Law Enforcement Park Ranger for the National Park Service. The first step to making this dream a reality is to attend the Northern Arizona University’s Park Ranger Training Program. The program is 3 months long in Flagstaff, Arizona and includes the 400 hour National Park Service Seasonal Law Enforcement Training Program that is required in order to obtain a position as a Law Enforcement Ranger for the Park Service. This is something I have always wanted to do but never knew how I could afford to do it. Recently I was blindsided when I lost my job. I didn’t see it coming at all, but I’ve decided that instead of having a pity party for myself that I am going to turn this into something positive. Losing my job is going to be the best thing that’s ever happened to me!</p>
<p><b>Why do I want to do this?</b></p>
<p>I truly love our National Parks and want to do everything I can to ensure that they are still here and protected for our future generations. I want to serve and protect these national treasures and devote myself to them. Growing up, my family would load up the station wagon (Griswald style) every summer and we would go to National Parks as our annual trip. Our family trips weren’t fancy and usually we were pretty much roughing it but the memories I have and the experiences are my happiest.  I want to make sure that other people can experience the magnificence and wonder of these very special places and hopefully get to create happy memories like I’ve been fortunate enough too. </p>
<p><b>What I Need &amp; Why.</b></p>
<p>I wish that I had the money that I need to do this on my own without becoming broke and losing everything but unfortunately I don't. <b>My goal with this campaign is to raise $8,785.00. </b>All of the money raised will go towards the program fees, travel, housing, and living expenses. Here is a more detailed breakdown of the costs. <b>   </b></p>
<ul>
<li>Program fee: $4,500 </li>
<li>Application fee: $150</li>
<li>Class fee: $385.00</li>
<li>Travel fuel: $200.00</li>
<li>Housing in Flagstaff, AZ: $2,850.00 ($950/month x’s 3 months) </li>
</ul><p>I know that this is a lot of money to ask for! I don’t how else I could make this dream a reality without your help. I’ve worked hard and have had at least one job, sometimes two, but have never been able to save enough up to attend this program. Your donation is all I got to make this happen. This opportunity is incredibly important to me and it will be a forever life-changing experience. I realize that I will have to make great sacrifices to make this happen and I am in it for the long hull. I can not wait to go through this program and finally be able to do my part to protect our National Parks and share my stories with you. </p>
<p><b>Other Ways You Can Help</b></p>
<p>If you are not able to donate, that's okay too, you can still help though! Get the word out! Share with your friends and family. Please post my campaign on Facebook, twitter, or email it to others. Whatever you can do will help me make my dreams come true! </p>

<p><span></span></p><p>Almost all nature field cards are a custom product. We create them uniquely for you. They specifically relate to what you are interested in, your level of expertise and the geo-location in which they are used. This is the most custom product of anything ever launched on Indiegogo. </p>
<p>I'd like to thank two people, Carrie and Greg. Their questions gave me insight on the terrible performance of this campaign so far.</p>The first problem is simple: Although they were both tech-savy researchers, it was not clear to them that I was actually using radio-cards (Near Field Communication). NFC is the 2nd most important technology of 2015 (in my opinion). The first would be 3-D printing. NFC has been used for transit and hotel cards, employee ID cards and office entry,  merchandise theft prevention and applications too numerous to mention. I believe it is as revolutionary as LED lighting. So I thought I was being clever about my double acronym. <span>Not so.</span> <p></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 24px; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">The magic of Nature Field Cards is Near field communication (NFC). </span><br/></p>
<p>The cards relay data as soon as they are within about 1/2 inch of the back of a NFC-enabled phone (most phones being produced are NFC- enabled since this is the standard to replace credit-cards in the near future). The phone emits a pulsed  wave, energizing a coil which supplies power to a radio chip embedded in the card. The card then transmits the contents of the chip to the phone. </p>
<p>The Nature Field Cards App grabs the information and separates it into many fields. Those fields have information including card options, the card type, the species, what types of cards may follow, etc.</p>
<p>Options may be option from this miniature database by using the numbered cube (which transmits data the same way).</p>
<p>If I observe a species of interest and it is flowering, the card tells the computer what the species is and offers options for the cube to select. By swiping the appropriate cube number, the phone  will record that the species is flowering. It also records the weather, geoposition, date/time, light level, observer info, group info and MUCH more (about 30 pieces of information). If you google 'encoded employee identification cards,' you'll see that $2-3 per card is less than a tenth what most people charge. I REALLY want this to be available to everyone. And to benefit everyone.</p>
<p>Nature Field Cards harness the incredible power people typically carry in their pockets and parlays it into a powerful tool for field research. The field research may be a  very specific inquiry with very specific data requirements (eg amphibian reproduction in the Oregon Cascades) or it may be a phenology-related project. Regardless of the inquiry, it is a custom inquiry relating to species found in a specific area of interest to a specific indifidual. We will CUSTOM make the program for this inquiry. Every Nature Field Card program is custom. For Indiegogo subscribers we make the program for you (you will fill out a small questionaire). Eventually it will be a simple automated online  form that will generate either the cards or the program that allows you to make your own cards at home. The data from the cards goes online with stipulations set for its public display determined by the user.  Most data will be public immediately. The more people participate,  learn and contribute, the more powerful the database. My ambition is that the data will enable good local and global decision making for preservation in our rapidly degrading environment.</p>
<p>EVERY deck (program) I'm selling is unique. The power of this program is that no two programs are (or need to be) the same. The cards are the program.</p>
<p>The cards will work at any water depth and even in saltwater. With your phone placed in an $11 clear case (I may even put these for sale in the premiums) you can use the cards and your phone to a depth of 10 feet. The cards will transmit their data to the mobile by swiping the same way as they do on land. GPS data will be recalibrated everytime you surface.</p>
<p>Cards cannot be reprogrammed in the field. In fact they cannot be reprogrammed at all. The reason is this:</p>
<p>We must ALWAYS be able to see the exact card that collected the data, know how it was encoded and know what both the front and backside of the card looked like. This will allow resolution of database problems resulting from possible card design flaws without throwing out the data. Each card designed has an internic-style number so all data can be traced to the actual card used in collection. If one was to change the data on the card in the field it would seriously compromise the robustness of data collected.</p>
<p>Data collected by all cards is tagged with the appropriate card ID. And the rules for each card are maintained forever in the database.</p>
<p>Nature Field Cards is meant for serious research -- not just 4th graders. However it is extremely easy to bring a youngster up to speed on typical phenological data collection. Thanks again Carrie and Greg! I encourage anybody with questions to contact me. In the meantime I'm going to get some better movies up to explain this and get everybody re-energized about this campaign.</p>
<p>I apologize for the confusion!</p>

Near Field Communication Cards for field researchers and global phenology data collection.


Let's Baseline the globe. NOW!






Rapid, automated, error-free natural cataloging and data collection.


Customized for each observer 

Almost all nature field cards are a custom product. We create them uniquely for you. They specifically relate to what you are interested in, your level of expertise and the geo-location in which they are used. This is the most custom product of anything ever launched on Indiegogo. 
I'd like to thank two people, Carrie and Greg. Their questions gave me insight on the terrible performance of this campaign so far.The first problem is simple: Although they were both tech-savy researchers, it was not clear to them that I was actually using radio-cards (Near Field Communication). NFC is the 2nd most important technology of 2015 (in my opinion). The first would be 3-D printing. NFC has been used for transit and hotel cards, employee ID cards and office entry,  merchandise theft prevention and applications too numerous to mention. I believe it is as revolutionary as LED lighting. So I thought I was being clever about my double acronym. Not so. 
The magic of Nature Field Cards is Near field communication (NFC). 
The cards relay data as soon as they are within about 1/2 inch of the back of a NFC-enabled phone (most phones being produced are NFC- enabled since this is the standard to replace credit-cards in the near future). The phone emits a pulsed  wave, energizing a coil which supplies power to a radio chip embedded in the card. The card then transmits the contents of the chip to the phone. 
The Nature Field Cards App grabs the information and separates it into many fields. Those fields have information including card options, the card type, the species, what types of cards may follow, etc.
Options may be option from this miniature database by using the numbered cube (which transmits data the same way).
If I observe a species of interest and it is flowering, the card tells the computer what the species is and offers options for the cube to select. By swiping the appropriate cube number, the phone  will record that the species is flowering. It also records the weather, geoposition, date/time, light level, observer info, group info and MUCH more (about 30 pieces of information). If you google 'encoded employee identification cards,' you'll see that $2-3 per card is less than a tenth what most people charge. I REALLY want this to be available to everyone. And to benefit everyone.
Nature Field Cards harness the incredible power people typically carry in their pockets and parlays it into a powerful tool for field research. The field research may be a  very specific inquiry with very specific data requirements (eg amphibian reproduction in the Oregon Cascades) or it may be a phenology-related project. Regardless of the inquiry, it is a custom inquiry relating to species found in a specific area of interest to a specific indifidual. We will CUSTOM make the program for this inquiry. Every Nature Field Card program is custom. For Indiegogo subscribers we make the program for you (you will fill out a small questionaire). Eventually it will be a simple automated online  form that will generate either the cards or the program that allows you to make your own cards at home. The data from the cards goes online with stipulations set for its public display determined by the user.  Most data will be public immediately. The more people participate,  learn and contribute, the more powerful the database. My ambition is that the data will enable good local and global decision making for preservation in our rapidly degrading environment.
EVERY deck (program) I'm selling is unique. The power of this program is that no two programs are (or need to be) the same. The cards are the program.
The cards will work at any water depth and even in saltwater. With your phone placed in an $11 clear case (I may even put these for sale in the premiums) you can use the cards and your phone to a depth of 10 feet. The cards will transmit their data to the mobile by swiping the same way as they do on land. GPS data will be recalibrated everytime you surface.
Cards cannot be reprogrammed in the field. In fact they cannot be reprogrammed at all. The reason is this:
We must ALWAYS be able to see the exact card that collected the data, know how it was encoded and know what both the front and backside of the card looked like. This will allow resolution of database problems resulting from possible card design flaws without throwing out the data. Each card designed has an internic-style number so all data can be traced to the actual card used in collection. If one was to change the data on the card in the field it would seriously compromise the robustness of data collected.
Data collected by all cards is tagged with the appropriate card ID. And the rules for each card are maintained forever in the database.
Nature Field Cards is meant for serious research -- not just 4th graders. However it is extremely easy to bring a youngster up to speed on typical phenological data collection. Thanks again Carrie and Greg! I encourage anybody with questions to contact me. In the meantime I'm going to get some better movies up to explain this and get everybody re-energized about this campaign.
I apologize for the confusion!




How Nature Field Cards work:

Observe
Compare
Swipe

Recording data has never been so easy. Nature Field Cards blend NFC technology with stunning graphics, compact data-structures, and coded program instructions. Each card contains its own data, program instructions, and distinct user graphics.





Millions of customized applications for millions of inquiries
Nature Field Cards provide field research and educational tools as diverse as nature itself. And, like nature, the Nature Field Card ecosystem is both simple and complex. Our unique card identification system ensures that each card will sync with similar cards across the database. In fact, the applications are so diverse that they have just one thing in common -- they use Nature Field Cards.
Super smart, super tough, and super accurate
Simple enough for a fourth grader yet powerful enough for the most accomplished researcher, Nature Field Cards operate with or without WiFi or Cellular connectivity.
Nature Field Cards cover nearly all research fields but use the same mobile applications -- the Prospectives mobile app and the Prospectives online analysis tool.
Each card tells the Prospectives mobile app what to expect, what to do, when there is an error and what cards may follow. Each species card may be followed by as many as 8 data-augmentation cards in any order. The depth of analysis is completely up to the Nature Field Card user.


Boxes of Different Phenophase Titles for use with species cards

Application cues include any combination of sound, voice, and minimal graphic display. Your Nature Field Card application allows you to easily collect valuable data without looking at the display.

I can't over-emphasize how custom this product is. Every order fulfilled will have different species and unique observer cards.


Sample observer card
Every observer will have different requirements for the the public release of data, be collecting different types of data from drastically different habitats. Some observers will be individual citizen scientist/ Others will be part of an organized group. Some will be simply using the cards to document supplements and treatments applied to their apiary or nursery. Others will be conducting important research. Others will be base-lining their hometown. Some will be 4th grade students, some will intellectual giants. The important thing is that they all will be collecting data that will help mitigate problems in species migrations, track invasives, correlate changes in land, water and air species to determine shared concerns.

Nature Field Cards provide many supplemental data augmentation cards. These can be as simple as nationally recognized phenophase protocols.



NFC cubes are the the perfect blend of handfinished wood and epoxy-encapsulated NFC electronics. They are beautiful and smart. Measuring 1.75"" on a side, they feel comfortable in the hand. 
The are  uncluttered yet visually striking. Specially engineered for the rigors of the field they even work in salt water. Handcrafted, assembled and programmed in Corvallis Oregon from windfall Maple.  These Fob-selectors choose from database options contained on each card. Cards may contain as many as 12 database options. The cube's six options are doubled through play of a 'B' card.




Cubes are amazingly visible in the dark with a low-lumen UV lamp

Risks & Challenges



The android version of Nature Field Cards is prototyped and working with unsecured SQL databases. Here are the primary challenges: 
  Port to IOS so everyone with an NFC-enabled mobile device can join the revolution. Secure and develop the online portion so the online analysis tools for Nature Field Cards data are just as awesome as the field technology. I want anybody who has ideas for experiments to freely analyse the data with an extremely powerful tool-set. For only when data is interpreted  and processed to determine its true  meaning can it be called information.  Plant phenology is the most reported biological indicator of anthropogenic climate change.

Develop the online Nature Field Card interface. Eventually I want people to be able to create their own cards -- unaided. An intuitive interface for transmogrifying citizen scientist desires into automatically generated and cataloged cards will be an important aspect. 
All materials for the project are sourced and stable. But LOTS of work will be involved in fulfilling orders since each card and each programmed dataset on each card are unique. Even with all this, I believe we'll be shipping in early December.

Oil interests have spent tens of millions of dollars on advertisements in British Columbia alone, blanketing the airwaves with messages intended to greenwash both tarsands oil and pipeline safety.We have created TV Ads to counter pro-tarsands propaganda and need your help getting them to air.

We are a group of media professionals volunteering our time and services. 

Polls in BC have been showing a slow but steady shift in public opinion as the oil company's incessant ads have started to have an effect. It's absolutely critical that the other side of the story is finally told.
You can see why we are opposed to the Tarsands and the Northern Gateway pipeline in detail by visiting PIPELINEFACTS.CA

You can help us put our ad on the air. You can make a difference.
We are anticipating generating further funds for more ad buys via referrals from the TV ads themselves; bootstrapping yet more ads. 
We are producing several 30 second ads that will air on regional (CBC - BC Region) tv in an attempt to counter the currently overwhelming pro-tarsands message.What We Need & What You GetThe only way this works is with your help. The primary goal is to raise funds to put our counter ads onto TV.
We will need to raise $16,000 to make the first 30 second ad buy.  
If we miss our goal your funds will be returned.We are anticipating generating further funds for more ad buys via referrals from the TV ads themselves; in effect bootstrapping yet more ads. If we raise more than our goal, funds will go towards buying airtime for additional ads.Everyone who donates $10 or more gets their name posted on the PIPELINEFACTS.CA wall of gratitude as well as on our Facebook page. A donation of $25 or more gets your name posted on the PIPELINEFACTS.CA wall of gratitude as well as on our Facebook page and a Twitter shout out. Donate over $75 and you get an awesome PIPELINEFACTS.CA T-Shirt like the one shown below (Courtesy of our very good friends at Two Sweaty Hands).

<h3>Game Plan</h3>
As any car lover knows, the  Nürburgring is one of the most famous and historic racing tracks in the world. The government is trying to sell it, and we need to save it from becoming the personal playground of a private owner, meaning the end of public track day use forever!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>From 2007 - 2009 the German government built <a href=""http://savethering.org/Nuerburgring_2009_Leisure_Park.jpg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a huge Leisure Park</a> at the Nürburgring. It is based on <a href=""http://jalopnik.com/tag/savethering/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">fake visitor numbers,</a> oversized and badly executed. Most of the time it is an empty ghost town. Once promised as private investment, it is now based on a debt of 350+ million EUR public money.</div>
<div>
<p>Instead of pulling the plug they rented the park - <strong>including both race tracks</strong> - to exactly the same privateers (<a href=""http://ringumbau.de/viewtopic.php?f=14&amp;t=31&amp;start=0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Kai Richter</a>, <a href=""http://ringumbau.de/viewtopic.php?f=11&amp;t=149#p321"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Jörg Lindner</a>), who were driving forces behind the Leisure Park's initial private setup.</p>

<h3>Stop the rabbits before they make more and more rabbits!!!</h3>
<p>We are developing an arcade style game for mobile devices.  The game will be initially released for iPhones; followed by Android and Tablets.</p>
<h3>The Game:</h3>
<p>Oh no! The farm rabbits have escaped their hutch and the wild rabbits are trying to mate with them!!!</p>
<p>Stop the madness by drawing fences to separate the male and female rabbits. If a male and female rabbit collide, they make a new rabbit;  you'll  have to fence off the baby bunnies too before they grow into full grown reproducing rabbits!  </p>
<p>The game gets increasingly harder within a level as more rabbits collide creating even more rabbits.  The levels get harder too as enemies like foxes and ""dogs on the loose"" appear in the field - each with the intent of eating your rabbits! </p>
<p>The more rabbits you have fenced, the higher your points, so you don't want to lose them! But you also don't want so many that you can't control the population growth either.</p>
<p>Game End:  You can lose a level if you lose all your rabbits, or you lose all of one sex of rabbit. You will also lose a level if you have a population explosion; if things get so out of hand that there are more rabbits than field to put them in... the level ends (but you can replay lost levels).</p>
<p>You need carrots to keep your rabbits well fed.  Run out of carrots and the game ends (and you'll have to start all over). </p>
<p>The game will also be peppered with mini-games to unlock.   For example, you may have to manouver your device to get the rabbits across a busy road.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; Why we need it:</h3>
<p>We are currently developing a demo of the movement mechanics, screen design and character designs. We need more funds to complete the demo. Then we will use the demo to entice a major game developer who we have already been in contact with. This developer is interested, but needs to see a more fully featured demo.</p>
<p>We have used our own funds and our own time to get the graphics and demo this far.  We need more cash to take the game demo further.  This is how the cash will be used:</p>
<ul>
<li>$250 for more graphic designs of:
<ul>
<li>the characters and their enemies</li>
<li>screen shots (load screens, etc.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>$500 for more features in the movement mechanics demo. For example:
<ul>
<li>Currently you can lose the game, but you cannot win the game. We need to program the software to calculate the areas divided by the fences and track the sexes of the rabbits in each area.</li>
<li>Scoring that will include the time bonus, and Field bonus (you get bonus points for lots of rabbits in a small field)</li>
<li>Enemies (Dogs and Foxes) will appear and kill the rabbits unless you fence them off first!</li>
<li>After successfully corraling the rabbits, the game will restart with one additional male and female rabbit. </li>
<li>Rabbits get smaller when there are more rabbits on the screen.  This allows for better game play in the later stages, with an easy learning curve and more visible details in the early stages.  </li>
<li>Audio - primarily better sound effects.</li>
<li>More compact code for playing on mobile devices (right now the game plays well on computers, but not on mobile devices with slower CPUs)</li>
<li>Any major overages that exceed the money needed for the demo will go towards the development of the final game.</li>

<strong>What is Finders Keepers?</strong></p>
<p dir=""LTR""><b>Finders Keepers</b> is a part of the global environmental effort to reduce waste and over-consumption by helping people share thrown away items quickly and easily using a free mobile application.</p>
<p dir=""LTR"">Think about how many times you've stumbled across a great item discarded on the sidewalk, but which you have no use for. Many unwanted, thrown away items could be freecycled – turning one person’s trash into another person’s treasure.</p>
<p dir=""LTR"">The<strong> Finders Keepers</strong> app will allow users to share photos of items they find along with their location via a GPS based map. Users will share their find with other app users and facebook friends. Users who are looking for items will be able to search by location and keywords. </p>
<p>Besides the social sharing benefit, and in
today’s disposable world, the impact on the
environment is no less important. Freecycling ultimately leads to less consumption, less
manufacturing and therefore, less pollution.<b> </b></p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><strong>Our aim</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To save people money by reusing items instead of buying new ones.</li>
<li>To help the environment by reducing unnecessary manufacturing and waste</li>
</ul>
<p><b></b> </p>
<p><b>Who are we?</b>
</p>
<p dir=""LTR"">We are Nataly, Ilan and Maor.</p>
<p dir=""LTR"">Nataly, a good friend of Ilan, thought up the idea of<b><em> </em>Finders Keepers</b> upon coming across a great looking bed which she saw one day on the street and had no use for. Wishing she could have shared her find with others who might really need it - the idea for the app was born. </p>
<p dir=""LTR"">Over coffee one day, Nataly discussed the idea with Ilan who has lots of app making experience. Ilan brought it up in a conversation with Maor, his business partner. <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">They thought that the idea is great indeed.</span></p>
<p dir=""LTR""><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Being 3 environment loving individuals who have many times in the past enjoyed the world of freecycling - we decided we must make our idea come to life.</span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><br/></span></p>
<p dir=""LTR""><strong>What We Need</strong></p>
<p dir=""LTR"">In order to make <b>Finders Keepers</b> we need additional funding of $16,000 for the production of the application (programming and design), for servers and for initial distribution through advertising. Please help us make this free application by donating.</p>
<p dir=""LTR""><strong></strong> </p>
<p dir=""LTR""><strong>What You Get</strong></p>
<p dir=""LTR"">In addition to a cleaner environment and tons of freecycled stuff, of course your contribution will also have its perks (as outlined to the right).</p>

Finders Keepers is a part of the global environmental effort to reduce waste and over-consumption by helping people share thrown away items quickly and easily using a free mobile application.
Think about how many times you've stumbled across a great item discarded on the sidewalk, but which you have no use for. Many unwanted, thrown away items could be freecycled – turning one person’s trash into another person’s treasure.
The Finders Keepers app will allow users to share photos of items they find along with their location via a GPS based map. Users will share their find with other app users and facebook friends. Users who are looking for items will be able to search by location and keywords. 
Besides the social sharing benefit, and in
today’s disposable world, the impact on the
environment is no less important. Freecycling ultimately leads to less consumption, less
manufacturing and therefore, less pollution. 
 
Our aim

To save people money by reusing items instead of buying new ones.
To help the environment by reducing unnecessary manufacturing and waste

 
Who are we?

We are Nataly, Ilan and Maor.
Nataly, a good friend of Ilan, thought up the idea of Finders Keepers upon coming across a great looking bed which she saw one day on the street and had no use for. Wishing she could have shared her find with others who might really need it - the idea for the app was born. 
Over coffee one day, Nataly discussed the idea with Ilan who has lots of app making experience. Ilan brought it up in a conversation with Maor, his business partner. They thought that the idea is great indeed.
Being 3 environment loving individuals who have many times in the past enjoyed the world of freecycling - we decided we must make our idea come to life.
What We Need
In order to make Finders Keepers we need additional funding of $16,000 for the production of the application (programming and design), for servers and for initial distribution through advertising. Please help us make this free application by donating.
 
What You Get
In addition to a cleaner environment and tons of freecycled stuff, of course your contribution will also have its perks (as outlined to the right).
 
Other Ways You Can Help
If you cannot contribute financially…

Please help us get the word out about Finders Keepers – share our crowd funding campaign and talk about it with friends.
Become a part of Finders Keepers distribution network: Send your e-mail address to FindersKeepersTheApp@gmail.com so when the app is up and ready, we can notify you to download it (for free) and help us populate it with all the items you spot and share it among your friends.

<p>#stopmonsanto is a scripted movie about five young activists who protest the actions of Monsanto by launching a #stopmonsanto campaign. The story begins with our main character attending an anti-Monsanto rally in an effort to impress his ex-girlfriend. While at the rally, he learns about Monsanto and soon becomes very involved in protesting against the company. Along the way, he teams up with several like-minded young people and they work together to raise awareness about Monsanto. When their initial methods of protest do not work, they perform a series of attention grabbing stunts. The protestors' actions put them in directly in the company’s sight, with devastating consequences.</p>
<h3><strong>THE STORY</strong></h3>

<div>
<p>We’re fed up with Monsanto and how they’re treating farmers and consumers, so we decided to make a movie about it.

Thinking about it I plan to design a machine to recycle 100% opensource that each of you may have in your home. Thus it could be recycled in a simple way, without all the difficult process that has not been carried out.</p>
<p>With your donation will design and build a prototype. At the end everyone will have access to the design (as will be opensource) but without your support may not be true.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>I would like to purchase multiple bee hives, to be placed in the charge of several members of our community, to foster our local bee population. These human-protected colonies of bees would regularly create new wild colonies. One community at a time, we can save the bees.</p>

<p>Our primary need is to purchase the hives, which are not cheap. Provided with adequate shelter, bees are very capable of providing for their own needs.</p>

The second one is food, then gear and some extra budget in case of unseen circumstances, and above all your support to make this project a real success.Without your support and donations, it would be very difficult to achieve this goal. I have saved up some with which I am getting my van ready and I’m hoping to raise $10,000 more to assist me with my 6-month road trip for a greater cause. Any financial gift from you will be a big help in reaching my goal.I’ve given herewith the breakdown of what the $10,000 I’m hoping to raise comprises of:The breakdown of cost for 6 months:Gas = 18000 - 19000 miles = $5000Food = $3000 - $3500Gear and Consumables = $1500 - $2000Extra budget in case of breakdowns = $5000Total: ~$15000 − my savings $5000 = $10000What I want to achieveBy showing people their favorite places covered with garbage I hope to get through to them to make them see the effects of their indifference. Building awareness and providing education are the most effective ways in making progress towards real change and lifestyle adjustments.Risks & ChallengesI have a lot of experience traveling by myself and I am totally fine about that. The biggest challenges I am going to face are unforeseen possible breakdowns in the middle of nowhere such as a flat tire, oil leak or belt replacement. I am going to prepare for that but the reality is that such repairs can be just expensive.Other Ways You Can HelpIf you are unable to contribute to this cause, here are some ways you can help:1.  Stop using plastic bags and buying bottled water;2.  Start using reusable items: at least cups, bottles and bags;3.  Consider picking up at least 3 pieces of trash which are not your own next time you go camping, backpacking, hiking or fishing.4.  ALWAYS throw garbage in a garbage bin and be an example to others.5.  You can use the Indiegogo share tools to share my crowdfunding campaign!More videos about the problem: Together we are building a better and brighter future not just for us but for our future generation “our children” – but without you, it just wouldn’t be possible.I don't want to protect the environment. I want to create a world where the environment doesn't need protection.Thank you so much for your support!",4.0,3,"2 Campaigns

</div></div>","SLOVENSKI OPIS V DRUGI POLOVICIPlease DON'T tell your FRIENDS I am making this!! :DHi there! :D
I like
  to REPAIR, REPURPOSE and MAKE.
I can design simple printed circuit boards, program microcontrollers in C and
  write/edit simple code in PHP, HTML, CSS. I am a handyman, work with wood and steel and
  plastic materials. I am studying for an Electrical Engineer.
More about me and some photos:  http://store.luftek.si/about
Design (pcb, acrylic, cable, power supply, cotton bag) PCB will have small tabs (easy to depanelize) in GREEN color + WHITE silkscreen with Merry Christmas and Happy New Year written on them.In KIT there will be through hole resistors. In ASSEMBLED one we will solder SMD ones.ACRYLIC used will be 2.5mm CLEAR acrylic in roughly this shape (on picture different material, similar shape):3m/10 feet MICRO USB CABLE and  POWER ADAPTER EU/USCOTTON BAG (storage or gift)nice green tree logo and little signatureAlternatives to 3d tree found on Google: click
3d Christmas Tree - prototypes


2010: there was a point 2
      point soldered tree on  a 9v battery (fixed color)


 

2012: my first etched circuit, cut apart by rotary tool (rgb changing color)


early 2013, ""professionally"" made PCB

Pricing

    For this to work out I need to order a minimum of 100 pcs of PCB, micro usb cables, power
    adapters (UK/EU), clear acrylic stands.
  

    All prices of parts include shipping and tax costs to me.
  
Price for perk Enjoyer ASSEMBLED is constructed of:

PCB 6$

40x slow
    flashing RGB led  5$

40x resistors 1$

micro usb smd connector 1$

5v power adapter 2$

usb cable 3m/10feet 2$ 
2x laser cut 2.5mm clear acrylic 2$

gift/storage cotton bag 2$

unexpected cost 3$ (hopefully mine)
soldering (need buy food and drinks for friends) 3$

shipping and handling 5$ 


    Which adds up to: 6+5+1+1+2+2+2+2+3+3+5=30$ 
  

    + 10% (Indiegogo + paypal) =33$

SHIPPING is INCLUDED in price

    All perks have international AIRMAIL (PRIORITY) shipping included (Posta
    Slovenije). Shipping times are specified here: times.pdf
Shipping weight: 16g + 6g + 10g + 0 + 30g + 80g+ 45g + 0 + 2g + 30g = cca. 220g (100g to 250g range)

Perks
3x small KIT for 43$/32€
3x Maker KIT for 76$/56€Want more of SAME? Contact me and I will add a PERK for you!

TimelineAs soon as the successful campaign ends (15.December) I will first order PCBs and Cotton bags. They take some time to produce. After that i will order other components. My friends are happy to help with soldering, handling and shipping. So perks will be send out immediately (1-2 days) after I receive all components.FAQ



How to power?Use 5V wall adapter, laptop USB, battery pack USB, any kind of 5V source.


When to expect my
        perks? I will frequently update status
        on my blog and here on indiegogo updates. I can't influence international airmail
        shipping. You should have it in mid January at least.


What is the power
        usage of LEDs?It uses about 2.5W of power. This would translate to 1/5 of a
        halogen energy saving bulb.


Can I control
        color? No, color changes based on the chip that is in LED. The effect is
        there, because colors diverge through time. They
        have slightly different periods.


Will you make source files OPEN? I will make all files open after succesful campaign. Files include pcb design, inscape design files, notes, acrylic design files. Will make a report on my blog.


The Impact
You will enjoy this LED tree throughout whole year, not just on Christmas/New Year
  holidays. I am not responsible for that. :P
Other Things you can do
You can make one yourself. I know you
  can DO it! See my ""crappy"" 2012 one. 
Please DON'T tell your FRIENDS I am making this!! :D

3x small KIT  je 43$/32€

3x Maker KIT je 76$/56€Hočete kakšno drugo kombinacijo? Kontaktirajte me in dodal bom nagrado za vas!


Časovnica
Takoj ko se kampanija konča (15.December) bom najprej naročil tiskanine in bombažne vrečke. To dvoje je narejeno po meni in traja najdlje. Potem bom naročil še ostale komponente. Prijatelji so mi pripravljeni pomagati pri spajkanju, pakiranju in pošiljanju. Nagrade bodo odposlane takoj (1-2 days) po prejetju vseh komponent.
Pogosta vprašanja in odgovori




Kako napajati?Uporabite 5V micro USB polnilec, USB priključek od prenosnika, baterije, kakršnegakoli vira USB.


Kdaj pričakovati nagrade(perke)?Pogosto bom osveževal status kampanije na svojem blogu in tukaj na indiegogo strani kampanijeI. Pričakujem, da boste svoje nagrade dobili do konca tega leta.


Kolikšna je poraba LEDic?Poraba je približno 2.5W električne energije. To lahko primerjamo z 1/5 energije varčne halogenske žarnice.

Lahko spreminjam barvo?Ne, barva se spreminja na osnovi v vsako LEDico vgrajenega čipa. Do efekta različnih barv pride, ker imajo različno periodo prižiganja/ugašanja barv.

Boš izvorne datoteke odprl za javnost?Po uspešni kampaniji bom datoteke naložil na blog in jih delil z vami.

<h3>Resumen</h3>
<p>En el año 2017 la empresa Arcangel Miguel S.A.S adquirió un predio con fines de siembra de monocultivos de aguacate Hass, amenazando la riqueza natural más apreciada del municipio: el agua. Este predio hoy llamado La Esperanza Poleal (La Lechería) está ubicado en las veredas La Mina, los Balsos y La Granja de Buenavista Quindío y dentro de el se encuentra el nacimiento de la microcuenca La Picota, la fuente de agua más importante del municipio. Ésta, surte al acueducto municipal abasteciendo a gran parte de la población urbana y rural del municipio. Además, el predio lleva más de quince años sin ser intervenido por actividades antrópicas, lo que ha dado lugar a un proceso de restauración natural en toda su área, garantizando la disponibilidad del recurso hídrico aún en las épocas de verano más fuertes.

I was born in Slovenia in the late seventies and grew up on the outskirts of the capital city with forest and freshwater streams around our family house. I love nature and green has always been my favorite color. After learning many different skills in a lot of different fields I followed my dream to live on an island of endless summer and kept pursuing two of my biggest passions kitesurfing and gardening. I came from water to be in and with water. Two accidents in sports, and two year long recovery and birth of my beautiful son Finn changed my focus in life. I realized the environment is not providing healthy food for my child and I started searching for a healthier way for my son to grow up. I live on an island where rainy days are few and land is barren, there are almost no fresh water sources to be found on the island. </span><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/317150/files/20140119052454-unnamed-_14_.jpg?1390137894"" src="""" style=""line-height: 1.45em;""/><br/></p><p>Me on North Shore, Fuerteventura<br/><br/></p><p>Since I didn’t want to spend large amounts of chlorinated water for my veggies to grow and being confined to a small space I had to come up with a different solution. After 2 years testing my Aquaponic garden I realized the classical Aquaponic closed-loop ecosystem can be upgraded to achieve better growing results and bi-produce drinking water or bio fuel. <br/></p><p><i><b>My intention is to take the project a little bit further and make a contribution to the local community, to build a garden for educational purposes as well for everyone to visit and learn about the growing process.</b></i><br/></p><p></p><p></p><p><i><b><br/></b></i></p><h3><b>About the project</b></h3><p>Aquaponic garden in short, uses fish waste to fertilize the plants growing above and in turn the plants clean the water for the fish. Living in cities or on non-fertile land having an Aquaponic garden provides the only chance to grow your own healthy vegetables, and grow them at a much faster rate (up to 30%) and in larger quantity on the same surface (up to 50%) than in soil. Now that I have successfully learnt how to grow from water and fish waste my research continues on how to harvest free falling water from Aquaponic garden. <br/><br/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/316990/files/20140119024121-unnamed-_10_.jpg?1390128081"" src="""" style=""width: 213.5148514851485px; height: 285px;""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/316991/files/20140119024204-unnamed-_9_.jpg?1390128124"" src="""" style=""line-height: 1.45em; width: 213.5148514851485px; height: 285px;""/></p><p>Building my home Aquaponics </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/316998/files/20140119025025-unnamed-_5_.jpg?1390128625"" src="""" style=""width: 189.98620689655172px; height: 142px;""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/317006/files/20140119025438-unnamed-_4_.jpg?1390128878"" src="""" style=""line-height: 1.45em; width: 189.972972972973px; height: 142px;""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/317003/files/20140119025206-unnamed-_3_.jpg?1390128726"" src="""" style=""line-height: 1.45em; width: 187.66901408450704px; height: 141px;""/></p><p>Testing the Aquaponics &amp; first veggies, and enjoying the surrounding greenery.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/317152/files/20140119052545-unnamed-_7_.jpg?1390137945"" src="""" style=""width: 174px; height: 232px;""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/317155/files/20140119052814-unnamed__2_.jpg?1390138094"" src="""" style=""line-height: 1.45em; width: 173.7573221757322px; height: 232px;""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/317154/files/20140119052615-unnamed27.jpg?1390137975"" src="""" style=""line-height: 1.45em; width: 174.50627615062763px; height: 233px;""/></p><p>Meet my boy and his treehouse</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/323689/files/20140122104305-unnamed__1_.jpg?1390416185"" src="""" style=""width: 179.28px; height: 135px;""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/323696/files/20140122104440-unnamed-_11_.jpg?1390416280"" src="""" style=""line-height: 1.45em; width: 180px; height: 135px;""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/323698/files/20140122104453-unnamed0.jpg?1390416293"" src="""" style=""line-height: 1.45em; width: 180.3020134228188px; height: 135px;""/></p><p>Starting, harvesting, extending, ... simple.</p><p></p><br/><p></p><p><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><i>Just think of how much energy is stored in a single water drop.</i> </b><br/></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">I’m working on ways how to use it. My main goal for the future is to harvest free falling water and turn it into electricity. The power needed to run Aquaponic garden is only 1/10th of power stored by Aquaponic moving water.</span><br/></p><p></p><p>We definitely don’t want to see this potential energy being wasted.</p><p>Furthermore I have also been dealing with quality of structure of water. Filters sold on the market to do such a task are costly (1000€ to 3000€ range), With this in mind I have been building and testing all sorts of filtering systems to purify and reconstruct water for healthy plants and fish. In the past year none of the fish died and all vegetables grew completely healthy, with nice green soft watery leaves. There have been some bug attacks, who wouldn’t want to enjoy such good food? Especially since the surrounding area around my house is so empty my garden attracts all sorts of animal life. I have also learnt that only food not harvested in time gets attacked, and now I just keep harvesting vegetables and sharing them with my neighbours. There are more and more people who value the importance of organic home grown food. With this in mind made me wonder what else I could do with a system that requires minimum electrical input. I thought of solar, however batteries are expensive and it’s not in line with the idea to keep things simple, to find materials for construction wherever you live. With a strong will and using only your hands and some guidelines everyone should be able to achieve same or similar results.</p><p><i>After testing a few pumps and water systems, the most ecological element with low consumption and easy to find was a restored water pump that circulates heated water in your house. Not quite cheap but energy efficient.</i></p><p>In Aquaponics flow is of the most importance, more flow - better results without any issues. Only the pressure should remain minimum, otherwise water structure is changed and damaged, and as you all know, water has memory. I like my water alive, fresh, energized with abundance of minerals. These facts brought my studies to the importance of trace elements and a conclusion that also the shape of the water tank itself has a great role in storing live water. I tried all sorts of shapes, egg shape seems to work the best since it's without any edges, no place for water to become stagnant. This way nature does it all. Regarding material I chose copper, due to the fact that copper is an essential trace element, vital to the health of all living things.</p><p><b><i>My aim is to build a large version of ""egg shaped"" tank, dropping water through vortex funnel to energize it and yield water energy.</i></b></p><p>The main goal is to keep continuous loop, no batteries needed, saves a lot of costs and further research must be done to find a simple and efficient way of doing so. Many trials will follow, but once results can be shown and tested for open source, everyone can do it.</p><p>Once I raise the funds to build an ""egg shape"" copper tank, then the system will not only be completely self-sustainable but will also produce excess electrical power from water turbine. Some water will be distilled to be later poured through mineral filter and produce mineral rich drinking water. Once you know the basics of Aquaponics and understand the environment you live in, constructing an Aquaponic garden isn’t just about food. The same system can also be used for producing biofuel using rotten or left over veggies or fruits.  </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/323615/files/20140122100153-unnamed__31_.jpg?1390413713"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Tindaya landscape, Fuerteventura</p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><b>The beauty of an Aquaponic garden project and its benefits include:</b></p><p>- no water wasted</p><p>- minimal water usage, 90% less than traditional farming</p><p>- no fertilizer needed</p><p>- no soil or fertile grounds needed</p><p>- no energy loss, only energy gain when properly assembled</p><p>- no electronical devices i.e. computer, controller or regulator needed</p><p>- no particular fish needed, you can even use guppy fish</p><p>- no expensive materials needed ( you can reuse some of the materials lying around your house)</p><p>- no food is wasted, since you can turn all your leftover veggies into biofuel</p><p>- once assembled, no tools needed, everything can be maintained by hands</p><p>- once Aquaponics is set up and running everyone can use its technology and enjoy its fruits from a 5 year old to your granny.</p><br/><p><b>However, there is one downside</b> - you need a place for it.</p><br/><br/><p><b>Project by phase:</b></p><p><i>1st phase (completed)</i></p><p>- building Aquaponic garden for a family needs</p><p>- running an efficient Aquaponic garden </p><p>- speeding up the growing process with different techniques</p><br/><p><i>2nd phase</i></p><p>- extending Aquaponic garden for communal use</p><p>- replacing pvc tubing with specially designed copper spirals</p><p>- building ""egg shaped"" copper tank</p><p>- testing hand made vortex turbine</p><p>- placing electrical generator to run the pump and use excess of electrical power</p><p>- producing bi-products: drinking water rich in minerals</p><br/><p><i>3rd phase</i></p><p>- harvest healthy vegetables and fruits faster (up to 30%) and in larger quantity (up to 50%) than in soil on same surface</p><p>- harvest excess of electrical power</p><p>- produce drinking water rich in minerals or bio fuel</p><br/><p><i>4th phase</i></p><p>- open the upgraded Aquaponic garden for educational purposes to community,  schools and local farmers </p><p>- set up mini SPA with energized water</p><p>- being able to study free fall water energy resource in more detail</p><p>- publishing a user guide about the project</p><p><br/></p><h3>What We Need</h3><p><i>Your kind contribution will go towards building self-sustainable closed-loop Aquaponics system open to public to educate interested individuals, groups, school children, local farmers about alternative ways of growing healthy vegetables and fruits and setting up an oasis like environment on such a barren island like Fuerteventura.

</div></div>","Short SummaryHi, My name is Gregor Kocijancic. I was born in Slovenia in the late seventies and grew up on the outskirts of the capital city with forest and freshwater streams around our family house. I love nature and green has always been my favorite color. After learning many different skills in a lot of different fields I followed my dream to live on an island of endless summer and kept pursuing two of my biggest passions kitesurfing and gardening. I came from water to be in and with water. Two accidents in sports, and two year long recovery and birth of my beautiful son Finn changed my focus in life. I realized the environment is not providing healthy food for my child and I started searching for a healthier way for my son to grow up. I live on an island where rainy days are few and land is barren, there are almost no fresh water sources to be found on the island. Me on North Shore, FuerteventuraSince I didn’t want to spend large amounts of chlorinated water for my veggies to grow and being confined to a small space I had to come up with a different solution. After 2 years testing my Aquaponic garden I realized the classical Aquaponic closed-loop ecosystem can be upgraded to achieve better growing results and bi-produce drinking water or bio fuel. My intention is to take the project a little bit further and make a contribution to the local community, to build a garden for educational purposes as well for everyone to visit and learn about the growing process.About the projectAquaponic garden in short, uses fish waste to fertilize the plants growing above and in turn the plants clean the water for the fish. Living in cities or on non-fertile land having an Aquaponic garden provides the only chance to grow your own healthy vegetables, and grow them at a much faster rate (up to 30%) and in larger quantity on the same surface (up to 50%) than in soil. Now that I have successfully learnt how to grow from water and fish waste my research continues on how to harvest free falling water from Aquaponic garden. Building my home Aquaponics Testing the Aquaponics & first veggies, and enjoying the surrounding greenery.Meet my boy and his treehouseStarting, harvesting, extending, ... simple.Just think of how much energy is stored in a single water drop. I’m working on ways how to use it. My main goal for the future is to harvest free falling water and turn it into electricity. The power needed to run Aquaponic garden is only 1/10th of power stored by Aquaponic moving water.We definitely don’t want to see this potential energy being wasted.Furthermore I have also been dealing with quality of structure of water. Filters sold on the market to do such a task are costly (1000€ to 3000€ range), With this in mind I have been building and testing all sorts of filtering systems to purify and reconstruct water for healthy plants and fish. In the past year none of the fish died and all vegetables grew completely healthy, with nice green soft watery leaves. There have been some bug attacks, who wouldn’t want to enjoy such good food? Especially since the surrounding area around my house is so empty my garden attracts all sorts of animal life. I have also learnt that only food not harvested in time gets attacked, and now I just keep harvesting vegetables and sharing them with my neighbours. There are more and more people who value the importance of organic home grown food. With this in mind made me wonder what else I could do with a system that requires minimum electrical input. I thought of solar, however batteries are expensive and it’s not in line with the idea to keep things simple, to find materials for construction wherever you live. With a strong will and using only your hands and some guidelines everyone should be able to achieve same or similar results.After testing a few pumps and water systems, the most ecological element with low consumption and easy to find was a restored water pump that circulates heated water in your house. Not quite cheap but energy efficient.In Aquaponics flow is of the most importance, more flow - better results without any issues. Only the pressure should remain minimum, otherwise water structure is changed and damaged, and as you all know, water has memory. I like my water alive, fresh, energized with abundance of minerals. These facts brought my studies to the importance of trace elements and a conclusion that also the shape of the water tank itself has a great role in storing live water. I tried all sorts of shapes, egg shape seems to work the best since it's without any edges, no place for water to become stagnant. This way nature does it all. Regarding material I chose copper, due to the fact that copper is an essential trace element, vital to the health of all living things.My aim is to build a large version of ""egg shaped"" tank, dropping water through vortex funnel to energize it and yield water energy.The main goal is to keep continuous loop, no batteries needed, saves a lot of costs and further research must be done to find a simple and efficient way of doing so. Many trials will follow, but once results can be shown and tested for open source, everyone can do it.Once I raise the funds to build an ""egg shape"" copper tank, then the system will not only be completely self-sustainable but will also produce excess electrical power from water turbine. Some water will be distilled to be later poured through mineral filter and produce mineral rich drinking water. Once you know the basics of Aquaponics and understand the environment you live in, constructing an Aquaponic garden isn’t just about food. The same system can also be used for producing biofuel using rotten or left over veggies or fruits.  Tindaya landscape, FuerteventuraThe beauty of an Aquaponic garden project and its benefits include:- no water wasted- minimal water usage, 90% less than traditional farming- no fertilizer needed- no soil or fertile grounds needed- no energy loss, only energy gain when properly assembled- no electronical devices i.e. computer, controller or regulator needed- no particular fish needed, you can even use guppy fish- no expensive materials needed ( you can reuse some of the materials lying around your house)- no food is wasted, since you can turn all your leftover veggies into biofuel- once assembled, no tools needed, everything can be maintained by hands- once Aquaponics is set up and running everyone can use its technology and enjoy its fruits from a 5 year old to your granny.However, there is one downside - you need a place for it.Project by phase:1st phase (completed)- building Aquaponic garden for a family needs- running an efficient Aquaponic garden - speeding up the growing process with different techniques2nd phase- extending Aquaponic garden for communal use- replacing pvc tubing with specially designed copper spirals- building ""egg shaped"" copper tank- testing hand made vortex turbine- placing electrical generator to run the pump and use excess of electrical power- producing bi-products: drinking water rich in minerals3rd phase- harvest healthy vegetables and fruits faster (up to 30%) and in larger quantity (up to 50%) than in soil on same surface- harvest excess of electrical power- produce drinking water rich in minerals or bio fuel4th phase- open the upgraded Aquaponic garden for educational purposes to community,  schools and local farmers - set up mini SPA with energized water- being able to study free fall water energy resource in more detail- publishing a user guide about the projectWhat We NeedYour kind contribution will go towards building self-sustainable closed-loop Aquaponics system open to public to educate interested individuals, groups, school children, local farmers about alternative ways of growing healthy vegetables and fruits and setting up an oasis like environment on such a barren island like Fuerteventura. Moreover to show how abundance is created in just a few months.Let's consider this as a landmark model for communities to harvest additional electrical power.35%  -  shall go to toward investing in the cheapest, rockiest, infertile land on which I will set up upgraded self-sustainable Aquaponics for educational purposes, and all its fees.20%  - shall cover the cost of research, materials (copper, wood, concrete, iron, tubes etc.) in building the Aquaponics system from phase 1 to 315%  - shall cover tools (for woodworking, copper working, welding equipment, microscope, water testing equipment), and hired equipment such as transport, digging works etc.15%  - shall be used to employ unemployed young local people for a period of one year to help construct and learn about the project.5% - shall go towards acquiring plants and soil for the ""Park of Abundance""5% -  the remainder of the funds shall go towards publishing a book - user guide about the project, therefore everyone can have access to first hand experience, technical information in order to build such a self-sustainable garden themselves. Time frame in which this project is estimated to be completed in is one year.  Is your donation making a difference?What You Get...Everything can be restored and balanced if only there is a will and need for it. I have helped many people to find a way of health and positive energy. Now I need you to help me achieve my goal that anybody can benefit from - children to young adults to seniors. Once you harmonize your environment, you restore your health, live happy, joyous life full of abundance. Sunset on the West coast, FuerteventuraPerks (what I can offer to you in exchange for your donation)€3: Thank you email and your name on the donation board.€10:  (all of the above) + regular emails during the time of building with funny photos from the project€25: (all of the above) + credits in the user guide about the project€50: (all of the above) + monthly update during and after project's completion€75: (all of the above) + weekly update during and after project's completion€100: (all of the above) + free copy of a user guide with my dedication€200: (all of the above) + access to all videos and process of project's development€500: (all of the above) + one time private free guided tour by me + a dip in the energized water SPA plus a delicious vegan dinner made of veggies from the garden€1000: (all of the above) + lifetime free pass to the garden & special credits on the donation board€5000: (all of the above) + you just bought me a ticket to come and explain the process in person at your home and offer my personal assistance with building your own Aquaponics garden or come and stay in my environment for a week and learn directly on site.€10.000: (all of the above) + handmade copper vortex funnel made just for you and delivered by me€90.000: (all of the above) + you can choose the name of the new ""Park of Abundance""(It can also be your name)What Community Gets...Until people do not see the project fully functioning they can't believe in it. That's why having a private Aquaponics project in my home isn't appropriate for communal educational use. Once the ""Park of Abundance"" becomes operational it will besides educational purposes set an example how to save energy. With small rearrangement of water distribution at same volume, much more potential in use of free fall water can be obtained. Much more than Aquaponic garden's needs are. I would like to show on a bigger scale how much energy can be extracted from use of gravity force and turn it to electrical supply. The model will show how to start the system with no electricity present. I will share this knowledge in detail with the supporters via videos, photos, emails and finally published user guide for all of you seeking for such a solution. The technology behind is of course not new only combined, rearranged and simplified for everyone to benefit from it. Water as intrinsic part of Nature is our best source of energy.If no funds are raised I shall still continue and invest my sources and time into the project I strongly believe in, not merely for growing healthier food for my family but also to achieve harmonious environment between plants, animals, humans.Goal of this campaign shall cover one third of the amount to have project successfully finished and opened for public. With this amount I will do my best to find sources and solutions that the project will contribute not only the community and its environment but mainly people's health and awareness.  Health, joy, happiness, abundance, harmony and above all love will drive me to continue my research in different areas for a better quality of life on this planet.Our Mutual ImpactIt's about sharing not owning.Let's all contribute to this great prosperous future.

<p>La <b><a href=""http://www.naturmente.es"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Asociación NaturMente</a></b> surge
de la necesidad de convertir nuestro planeta en un lugar más sostenible, pero
desde un punto de vista totalmente diferente al que estamos acostumbrados,
utilizando la educación como herramienta básica para conseguir nuestra meta.<br/>
Unos de los ecosistemas más degradados en la actualidad y que más necesarios
nos son, son los ríos. De aquí surge la idea de hacer el  proyecto
""Cuida tus ríos"" con el que pretendemos hacer consciente a la
población de la gran cantidad de recursos que nos proporcionan los ríos y la
importancia de conservarlos y gestionarlos de manera adecuada.</p>
<h3><b>Cuida tus ríos
- El proyecto</b></h3>
<p>En el proyecto <b>""Cuida tus ríos""</b> pretendemos
hacer consciente a la población de la importancia de los ríos y la calidad de
sus aguas en nuestros ecosistemas, además de la gran importancia del agua como
recurso, como fuente de vida. Históricamente las principales ciudades y
asentamientos humanos se han realizado en las proximidades y cercanías de los
ríos, ya que el cauce en sí nos ofrece una amplia cantidad de recursos - agua,
alimento, energía- que encontramos en las llanuras próximas a los ríos (tierras
fértiles, bosques de ribera...). Actualmente con un pequeño gesto como abrir el
grifo conseguimos agua potable, el recurso más preciado y necesario para el ser
humano, y no somos conscientes del trabajo que esto lleva detrás y de la
importancia de mantener nuestros ríos en un buen estado de salud para poder
seguir disfrutando de todos estos recursos que nos facilitan. </p>
<p>El proyecto <b>""Cuida tus ríos""</b> se encuentra dividido en tres bloques de
actividades, siendo el apartado ""Inspeccionando ríos"" en el que nos
centramos en esta campaña de crowdfunding. </p>
<p>Se hará una visita a un río
cercano de la zona, donde se realizará un estudio de las características
físicas y químicas de éste. Con esta actividad se pretende que los alumnos

<h2><span><span>El
impacto</span></span></h2>
<p><span>Creemos que el proyecto
tendrá un impacto positivo y duradero tanto en los niños y niñas que participen
en nuestro proyecto, así como en el profesorado de las escuelas, haciéndoles
conscientes de la importancia de conservar el medio ambiente en general, y de
los ríos en particular. Creemos que el alcanzar la idea de un mundo más
sostenible con el medio ambiente es posible, siempre que se lleve a cabo desde
la educación, y de manera que esta idea de sostenibilidad se consiga integrar
en la sociedad. Son las nuevas generaciones y las generaciones futuras las que
tienen en su mano realizar este cambio, por eso creemos que educando a los
niños y adolescentes actuales con una base por el respeto hacia la naturaleza
tendrá un impacto a largo plazo sobre el medio ambiente. </span></p>
<p><span>Además los resultados de los
parámetros analizados se enviarán al proyecto ""Día Mundial de la Calidad
del Agua"" para contribuir a crear una red de estudio de la calidad de
aguas, así como a un estudio propio de la Asociación NaturMente, con el cual pretendemos
evaluar la calidad de las aguas de la Comunidad de Madrid y, si fuera posible,
establecer un inventario de puntos de contaminación. </span></p>

La Asociación NaturMente surge
de la necesidad de convertir nuestro planeta en un lugar más sostenible, pero
desde un punto de vista totalmente diferente al que estamos acostumbrados,
utilizando la educación como herramienta básica para conseguir nuestra meta.
Unos de los ecosistemas más degradados en la actualidad y que más necesarios
nos son, son los ríos. De aquí surge la idea de hacer el  proyecto
""Cuida tus ríos"" con el que pretendemos hacer consciente a la
población de la gran cantidad de recursos que nos proporcionan los ríos y la
importancia de conservarlos y gestionarlos de manera adecuada.
Cuida tus ríos
- El proyecto
En el proyecto ""Cuida tus ríos"" pretendemos
hacer consciente a la población de la importancia de los ríos y la calidad de
sus aguas en nuestros ecosistemas, además de la gran importancia del agua como
recurso, como fuente de vida. Históricamente las principales ciudades y
asentamientos humanos se han realizado en las proximidades y cercanías de los
ríos, ya que el cauce en sí nos ofrece una amplia cantidad de recursos - agua,
alimento, energía- que encontramos en las llanuras próximas a los ríos (tierras
fértiles, bosques de ribera...). Actualmente con un pequeño gesto como abrir el
grifo conseguimos agua potable, el recurso más preciado y necesario para el ser
humano, y no somos conscientes del trabajo que esto lleva detrás y de la
importancia de mantener nuestros ríos en un buen estado de salud para poder
seguir disfrutando de todos estos recursos que nos facilitan. 
El proyecto ""Cuida tus ríos"" se encuentra dividido en tres bloques de
actividades, siendo el apartado ""Inspeccionando ríos"" en el que nos
centramos en esta campaña de crowdfunding. 
Se hará una visita a un río
cercano de la zona, donde se realizará un estudio de las características
físicas y químicas de éste. Con esta actividad se pretende que los alumnos
se sientan investigadores por un día. De este modo se consigue un
mayor acercamiento de los pequeños al mundo de la biología, la investigación y
la conservación. Los alumnos tendrán que buscar cuales son las características
visuales que indican que ese río está contaminado. A continuación cada grupo
cogerá una muestra de agua del río y analizará indicadores físico-químicos y
los indicadores biológicos - Todo esto con kits especializados y no tóxicos-.
De esta manera podremos conocer la calidad del agua de dicho río y saber si el
río está contaminado o no y la posible procedencia de los contaminantes. 
Las otras dos actividades que
forman parte del proyecto ""Cuida tus ríos"" (y a las que se destinará
la financiación obtenida una vez cubierto el 100% de los gastos de la actividad ""Inspeccionando
ríos"") son las siguientes:
-Acercándonos
a los ríos. En esta parte de la actividad se hará una explicación teórica del
ciclo del agua, así como de las propiedades del agua, y de la fauna y flora
característica que podemos encontrar en este ecosistema.   
-Adopta un río. Esta
última parte de la actividad se realizará en el aula del colegio. Consiste en
la puesta en marcha de mecanismos que nos ayuden a resolver los
problemas detectados durante las inspecciones. Tales como la limpieza del
cauce y conservación.                                          Kit de análisis para el muestreo de agua¿Quienes somos? Historia de NaturMenteEn la Asociación NaturMente partimos de la base de que la educación y la
comprensión son los pilares fundamentales para establecer un cambio en la
sociedad actual, y que éste cambio realmente repercuta en el comportamiento de

A pesar de la corta edad de la asociación han sido
varios los proyectos realizados por los jóvenes que la componen. Cabe destacar
el primer premio conseguido en el concurso “Ideas Vivas” promovido por la Casa
de la Juventud del Ayuntamiento de Parla con el proyecto “Acercándonos a las
Aves” en noviembre de 2012.

 A mediados de diciembre de 2012 este grupo de jóvenes
ganó otro premio gracias al concurso “Think
Big” organizado por la Fundación Telefónica. Esta vez, el proyecto con el
nombre “Cajas nido, Magníficos chalets”.El 9 de abril de 2014, se realizó la actividad “Día de
las aves en Parla” con el objetivo de acercar los valores naturales a los
habitantes del municipio de Parla. Durante los días 23 de marzo, 6 y 27 de abril de 2014 se llevó a cabo la actividad ¿Quien vive aquí? con el objetivo de realizar un seguimiento de las cajas nido anteriormente colocadas y observar las puestas de huevos y polluelos de las aves de los parques.El equipoLa Asociación NaturMente está formada por un grupo de jóvenes cuya pasión por la conservación de la naturaleza y la divulgación les lleva a la realización de diversas actividades para todos los públicos. Estos jóvenes tienen una gran experiencia profesional y académica, contando con biólogos y pedagógos especializados en el área de la educación ambiental. El equipo de NaturMente:

El
impacto
Creemos que el proyecto
tendrá un impacto positivo y duradero tanto en los niños y niñas que participen
en nuestro proyecto, así como en el profesorado de las escuelas, haciéndoles
conscientes de la importancia de conservar el medio ambiente en general, y de
los ríos en particular. Creemos que el alcanzar la idea de un mundo más
sostenible con el medio ambiente es posible, siempre que se lleve a cabo desde
la educación, y de manera que esta idea de sostenibilidad se consiga integrar
en la sociedad. Son las nuevas generaciones y las generaciones futuras las que
tienen en su mano realizar este cambio, por eso creemos que educando a los
niños y adolescentes actuales con una base por el respeto hacia la naturaleza
tendrá un impacto a largo plazo sobre el medio ambiente. 
Además los resultados de los
parámetros analizados se enviarán al proyecto ""Día Mundial de la Calidad
del Agua"" para contribuir a crear una red de estudio de la calidad de
aguas, así como a un estudio propio de la Asociación NaturMente, con el cual pretendemos
evaluar la calidad de las aguas de la Comunidad de Madrid y, si fuera posible,
establecer un inventario de puntos de contaminación. 
""A
fin de cuentas, sólo conservamos lo que amamos. Sólo amamos lo que
comprendemos. Sólo comprendemos lo que nos han enseñado""

<p>We are a group of young entrepreneurs wanting to create a social and environmental impact in our zones. What is the impact? Our main impact is the creation of ecological backpacks out of recycled fabric. It all started as an idea of helping the environment and giving a durable product. What make us different from others? We want to give the people the freedom to decorate their backpacks as they wish by helping then environment, using plastic bottles and containers to make keychains and screw caps to make pins.</p>
<p>Our campaign is to get support and get people to know us, also to start to give knew life to products already used, it is important to us because as citizens we want to make an impact, we are seeking for the world to know us and help us. </p>
<p>We have a lot of plans for our enterprise, we want to reach the point in which we can make the backpacks out of plastic bottles instead of recycled fabric or both, so we want to reach that point. Be known by the world and the ability to create it from the beginning. We want to have the capacity to create big quantities of backpacks and the accessories and be the entrepreneurs we want to be. </p>
<p>The world needs people worried for the environment and it is not only about stop using straws, it is about more, thinking out of the box, wanting a change. We want a change, we want to reduce the contamination created by plastic and fabric and also give it another use to this materials. The change is in you. </p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p> We need around 5,000 dollars, firstly because our one time costs, we need ovens and sewers to make the keychains and the backpacks, tables, chairs, laptops and drawers, also if we include the services just as water, electricity, gas, internet, phone installations it cost us around 2,000 dollars. On the other hand, our fixed and variable costs are because the services we just mention before and adding the rent, promotion, trash collection service but also the material to make the backpacks and to make our enterprise work, we need pins, fabric straps, zippers, scissors, measuring tape, linen, needles, plastic containers and bottles, box for the package, bags for the package too and the shipment that costs us around 3,000 dollars.  </p>
<p>Backpacks are an accessory that we as students use at least five days in the week, so what better that carrying your own style in your back, the style that make you feel comfortable while you are helping the environment. We want to give your internal artist a opportunity to express itself and give you the freedom to personalize this backpack mixing colours, textures, pins, keychains, patches.</p>
<p>If we do not reach our goal we will use the money to start the business with baby steps, trying to use what is at our reach to increase it and make our enterprise grow.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>Our project is not only about the environment but also about the culture and social, why? As we know Mexico is a country full of culture and colours but also has a high level of people and mostly women who do not have any sources or the facility to work or get a job, moreover, also our culture is not known, what are we going to do? we are going to pay them to make the backpacks, give them a job with a fair payment, also that they can make their designs with the fabric as a prove of the culture of our country in order to an equality in jobs and to increase their income and to let the world know about the culture of Mexico by using designs full of itself. </p>
<p>As we want this to become a reality, we have been looking for places with a high level of women without any jobs and low incomes nearby us. We have found places like ""DIF Madero"", ""DIF Tampico"" in which we can take this idea as a project and campaigns and not only get their help but also help them.</p>
<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
<p>The principal risk is not receiving the money in case we do not receive anything our project will be forgotten and left behind. On the other hand, we can solve this by looking for other options to get some money in order to keep this project alive</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>We want a project to be known all around the world, so by sharing and telling others about what is our project about is really helpful!! Make some noise!! Share our social media with all your contacts! And if you have ideas for use feel free to contact us and tell us what you think.</p>

<p>- Every 10 seconds a child

(Over 3 million/year)<br/>- Every 20 seconds a child dies due to poor sanitation (Over 1.5 million/year)<br/>- Almost 4 in 10 people lack access to improved sanitation (2.5 billion people)<br/>- 1 in 7 people are forced to resort to open defecation for lack of other options.<br/>  (1 billion people)<br/>- 1 in 9 people lack access to safe water (750 million people)<br/>- 1 in 9 people do not have enough food to lead a healthy active life (850 million <br/>   people)<br/>- 1 in 6 people live in extreme poverty, defined as less than $1.25 per day (1.2 billion <br/>   people)<br/>- 8 in 10 people who lack access to improved water live in rural areas (600 million <br/>   people)</p><p><br/></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>   Poverty, lack of
sanitation, no access to clean water, and not enough food means
millions and millions of people are suffering and dying needlessly!</p>
<p>
</p><p>   Our flagship program will create financially self-sufficient Humanitarian Sites that supply FREE sewage and water treatment, among other things, to poor areas.<br/></p><p>   Together, we can change this, and
not merely temporarily with charity, but permanently with

<p>   GISS relies on low-tech
and green technology that allows it to be financially and environmentally
sustainable. It addresses all the humanitarian problems above, and
helps improve the environment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>   The goal of this
campaign is to launch GISS and propel it and its solutions onto the
world stage. To accomplish this and to change the world we must be able
to present GISS in an understandable manner, reach governments, find
backers, garner attention for our project. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>   Why does this campaign
and this project matter? Simple... GISS matters because lives are at
stake! Millions of lives are at stake!</p><p>   To understand what we mean by sites, and how a GISS site functions you can read the following PDF. It will provide a more concrete understanding: <a href=""https://www.dropbox.com/s/6gb2577q9lyeu5k/GISS%20Technologies%20Project%20Summary.pdf?dl=0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.dropbox.com/s/6gb2577q9lyeu5k/GISS%20Technologies%20Project%20Summary.pdf?dl=0</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><b>ABOUT
ME</b></p>
<p>   My name is Rob
Corra. I am
the founder of GISS Technologies and designer of GISS. A humanitarian
philosopher and problem solver, I
started my career in agriculture, before entering the US Air Force. I
served 9 years doing high tech electronic maintenance and E&amp;I
(Engineering and Installation) projects working with people from many
countries. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>   After
the Air Force, I studied philosophy, anthropology, religions, and
science. I became a Philosophy Professor, a store owner, and owner of
a software company. I managed the successful creation of a virtual
world for a client that saw, at times 4 teams of programmers,
artists, audio personnel, and more scattered over 2 countries. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>   Six
years ago I moved to Brazil. It was here that I realized the main
reason poor areas are not helped is economics. It costs money to
build, and more importantly, maintain the necessary sites to help
people. It was at this time that I began working on GISS,
while running my own ESL school.

</p>
<p>
</p><p>   I
have also spent over 25 years studying and designing complete aquatic
systems, including complete nitrogen cycles, using aquarium systems,
which creates the basis of aquaponics (aquaculture and hydroponics)
systems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><b>WHAT YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS
WILL ACCOMPLISH</b></p>
<p>   Your contributions will
help us to change the way the world thinks about humanitarian work!  
 With your help we will save lives! Each contribution will have a permanent impact. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>   We tend to think that
the world's problems are too big for us affect, let alone to solve,
but this is untrue. We can make a difference. <b>YOU CAN MAKE A
DIFFERENCE!</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>   Essentially our sites
will create permanent solutions to the problems of poor sanitation,
unclean water, malnutrition, poverty, and even many environmental
problems in areas where we operate. </p><p>   Instead of providing aid to an
area, we will install a site that generates an income for the area,
while providing them with their essential needs. </p><p>   There is more information and links in the sections ""Additional Information."" </p><p>   So to learn more, read on...  </p><p><br/></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><h3>
What
We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><b>FUNDRAISING GOALS AND
BUDGET</b></p>
<p> The amount necessary to get running
is $40,000. This will launch GISS, however, each successive stretch
goal will allow us to do more, faster, and longer. Goal 3 would be a full
launch of Phase I. This means we would then be ready to build live sites and
speak with governments about site locations. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>   A brief budget
breakdown follows.</p>
<p>
</p><p><u>Goal 1 = $40,000<br/></u></p>
<p>   Allows for the creation
of the company, minimal legal fees, accounting fees, and protection
of IP (Intellectual Property). It will allow us to create the office
and gives us 6 months of operations, which will include the creation
of the website and Promotional Magazine.</p>
<p>
</p><p><u>Goal 2 (Stretch Goal 1)
= $80,000</u></p>
<p>   Allows for the creation
of the company, legal fees, accounting fees, and protection of IP
(Intellectual Property). It will allow us to create the office and
gives us 12 months of operations, which will include the creation of
the website and Promotional Magazine. Also we will have a limited
budget for traveling to meet officials in preparation of creating the
sites.</p>
<p><u>Goal 3 (Stretch Goal 2)
= $160,000</u></p>
<p>   Allows for the
completion of Phase I. This includes the creation of the company,
legal fees, accounting fees, and protection of IP (Intellectual
Property). It will allow us to create the office and gives us 12
months of operations, which will include the creation of the website
and Promotional Magazine. Also we will have a budget for traveling to
meet officials in preparation of creating the sites, as well as,
being able to travel to meet VIPs, partners, and even give talks to
raise awareness and ultimately funds.</p>
<p>   This level of funding
will also allow us to completely prepare for Phase II/III, compete
the Internal Design Manual and R&amp;D Manual, create promotional
videos/packages, and do some preliminary site surveys</p>
<p>
</p><p><u>Goals Beyond 3</u></p>
<p>   Reaching Goal 4 is beyond
our wildest expectations and will allow us to actually create humanitarian
sites. The next Stretch Goal after Goal 3 is $1,000,000. Some campaigns have
crushed their original launch goal, and we definitely hope to do the
same thing. However for simplicity's sake these higher goals will be put in a separate PDF
along with a more detailed version of the budget.</p>
<p>   The extra budgetary
information may be found at the following link:
<a href=""https://www.dropbox.com/s/x4mu2lasyqh0byf/Goals%20and%20Stretch%20Goals%20with%20Simplified%20Budget.pdf?dl=0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.dropbox.com/s/x4mu2lasyqh0byf/Goals%20and%20Stretch%20Goals%20with%20Simplified%20Budget.pdf?dl=0</a></p>
<p>
</p><p><b>PERKS</b></p>
<p>   Hopefully you are
contributing to save lives. This in itself is a great reward.
However, we are extremely grateful to those who extend a
helping hand, thus we want to remember you in perpetuity.</p>
<p>   GISS is a humanitarian
project that will not produce a specific product, but instead provide
a service and save lives. As such, we are offering recognition for
your help, not a product. Your contributions will be recorded in the website,
Promotional Magazine, and Promo Booklet as founding contributors.
These will remain as long as GISS Technologies is functioning. 
</p>
<p>   Or you may chose to HONOR
someone (or 2 people), such as a child, parent, or even parents with
a contribution in their name, instead of your own. 
</p>
<p>   You may also chose to
contribute in MEMORY of someone (or 2 people) whose deceased in the
same manner as honoring the living.</p><p><br/></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><h3>
The
Impact of GISS</h3>
<p>   The GISS Project will
completely transform people's lives and how we view humanitarian
work. Reaching the poor, especially in rural areas is a costly endeavor
and one that governments tend to ignore, despite the fact that a
significant portion of the world's population live in rural areas. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>   We will address this
need in a unique way, and make the change to an area permanent. We
will transform the world. </p><p>   When we help a community, we will create the
infrastructure for them to meet their basic needs and create an
income to run the infrastructure. This means that once established, GISS Technologies will not have to raise more money to support this
region again, barring any disasters, but even these we will likely be
able to handle once the company is robust enough.</p>
<p>
</p><p>   While initially
focusing on free services in rural settings, GISS Technologies will be able to help in
urban settings, and even sell green solutions/services to
industries, and developed areas. The company's income will help with
research and development costs, operational costs, handling disasters
and unexpected costs, and expanding into new regions.</p><p><br/></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><h3>
Risks
&amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>   Our biggest risk is
that we do not receive the funding we need to proceed. We must pass
our first goal of $40,000 to, among other things, hire an illustrator to create the
promotional material so we can show governments and organizations
what our system can accomplish. <br/>
</p><p>   Our immediate stretch
goals (Stretch Goal 1 and 2) are also important in accelerating our
time scale and helping people faster, as it will allow us to travel,
do presentations, and access more resources. If we fail to hit our
stretch goals then we will have to move forward more slowly and will
need to search for funding to proceed beyond our initial goals.</p>
<p>
</p><p>   We also face design
hurdles for making the sites smaller and more flexible in regards to
their operating environment. Currently, the technology and designs that have been proven to work require large areas and Sub-Tropic to
Tropic climes. GISS Technologies has designed some innovative
solutions to by-pass these limitations, however we will need to build
our Research &amp; Development facility to test these designs. Until
we can do this, we will be limited to rural areas in warmer climates
for our sites. Fortunately for us, this is where the majority of the
need exists.</p><p><br/></p>

dies as a result of under-nutrition. (Over 3 million/year)- Every 20 seconds a child dies due to poor sanitation (Over 1.5 million/year)- Almost 4 in 10 people lack access to improved sanitation (2.5 billion people)- 1 in 7 people are forced to resort to open defecation for lack of other options.  (1 billion people)- 1 in 9 people lack access to safe water (750 million people)- 1 in 9 people do not have enough food to lead a healthy active life (850 million    people)- 1 in 6 people live in extreme poverty, defined as less than $1.25 per day (1.2 billion    people)- 8 in 10 people who lack access to improved water live in rural areas (600 million    people)


   Poverty, lack of
sanitation, no access to clean water, and not enough food means
millions and millions of people are suffering and dying needlessly!

   Our flagship program will create financially self-sufficient Humanitarian Sites that supply FREE sewage and water treatment, among other things, to poor areas.   Together, we can change this, and
not merely temporarily with charity, but permanently with
infrastructure. GISS will change how we think about helping people.

sustainable. It addresses all the humanitarian problems above, and
helps improve the environment.

   The goal of this
campaign is to launch GISS and propel it and its solutions onto the
world stage. To accomplish this and to change the world we must be able
to present GISS in an understandable manner, reach governments, find
backers, garner attention for our project. 


   Why does this campaign
and this project matter? Simple... GISS matters because lives are at
stake! Millions of lives are at stake!   To understand what we mean by sites, and how a GISS site functions you can read the following PDF. It will provide a more concrete understanding: https://www.dropbox.com/s/6gb2577q9lyeu5k/GISS%20Technologies%20Project%20Summary.pdf?dl=0


ABOUT
ME
   My name is Rob
Corra. I am
the founder of GISS Technologies and designer of GISS. A humanitarian
philosopher and problem solver, I
started my career in agriculture, before entering the US Air Force. I
served 9 years doing high tech electronic maintenance and E&I
(Engineering and Installation) projects working with people from many
countries. 


   After
the Air Force, I studied philosophy, anthropology, religions, and
science. I became a Philosophy Professor, a store owner, and owner of
a software company. I managed the successful creation of a virtual
world for a client that saw, at times 4 teams of programmers,
artists, audio personnel, and more scattered over 2 countries. 


   Six
years ago I moved to Brazil. It was here that I realized the main
reason poor areas are not helped is economics. It costs money to
build, and more importantly, maintain the necessary sites to help
people. It was at this time that I began working on GISS,
while running my own ESL school.



   I
have also spent over 25 years studying and designing complete aquatic
systems, including complete nitrogen cycles, using aquarium systems,
which creates the basis of aquaponics (aquaculture and hydroponics)
systems.


WHAT YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS
WILL ACCOMPLISH
   Your contributions will
help us to change the way the world thinks about humanitarian work!  
 With your help we will save lives! Each contribution will have a permanent impact. 


   We tend to think that
the world's problems are too big for us affect, let alone to solve,
but this is untrue. We can make a difference. YOU CAN MAKE A
DIFFERENCE!

   Essentially our sites
will create permanent solutions to the problems of poor sanitation,
unclean water, malnutrition, poverty, and even many environmental
problems in areas where we operate.    Instead of providing aid to an
area, we will install a site that generates an income for the area,
while providing them with their essential needs.    There is more information and links in the sections ""Additional Information.""    So to learn more, read on...  



What
We Need & What You Get
FUNDRAISING GOALS AND
BUDGET
 The amount necessary to get running
is $40,000. This will launch GISS, however, each successive stretch
goal will allow us to do more, faster, and longer. Goal 3 would be a full
launch of Phase I. This means we would then be ready to build live sites and
speak with governments about site locations. 


   A brief budget
breakdown follows.

Goal 1 = $40,000
   Allows for the creation
of the company, minimal legal fees, accounting fees, and protection
of IP (Intellectual Property). It will allow us to create the office
and gives us 6 months of operations, which will include the creation
of the website and Promotional Magazine.

Goal 2 (Stretch Goal 1)
= $80,000
   Allows for the creation
of the company, legal fees, accounting fees, and protection of IP
(Intellectual Property). It will allow us to create the office and
gives us 12 months of operations, which will include the creation of
the website and Promotional Magazine. Also we will have a limited
budget for traveling to meet officials in preparation of creating the
sites.
Goal 3 (Stretch Goal 2)
= $160,000
   Allows for the
completion of Phase I. This includes the creation of the company,
legal fees, accounting fees, and protection of IP (Intellectual
Property). It will allow us to create the office and gives us 12
months of operations, which will include the creation of the website
and Promotional Magazine. Also we will have a budget for traveling to
meet officials in preparation of creating the sites, as well as,
being able to travel to meet VIPs, partners, and even give talks to
raise awareness and ultimately funds.
   This level of funding
will also allow us to completely prepare for Phase II/III, compete
the Internal Design Manual and R&D Manual, create promotional
videos/packages, and do some preliminary site surveys

Goals Beyond 3
   Reaching Goal 4 is beyond
our wildest expectations and will allow us to actually create humanitarian
sites. The next Stretch Goal after Goal 3 is $1,000,000. Some campaigns have
crushed their original launch goal, and we definitely hope to do the
same thing. However for simplicity's sake these higher goals will be put in a separate PDF
along with a more detailed version of the budget.
   The extra budgetary
information may be found at the following link:
https://www.dropbox.com/s/x4mu2lasyqh0byf/Goals%20and%20Stretch%20Goals%20with%20Simplified%20Budget.pdf?dl=0

PERKS
   Hopefully you are
contributing to save lives. This in itself is a great reward.
However, we are extremely grateful to those who extend a
helping hand, thus we want to remember you in perpetuity.
   GISS is a humanitarian
project that will not produce a specific product, but instead provide
a service and save lives. As such, we are offering recognition for
your help, not a product. Your contributions will be recorded in the website,
Promotional Magazine, and Promo Booklet as founding contributors.
These will remain as long as GISS Technologies is functioning. 

   Or you may chose to HONOR
someone (or 2 people), such as a child, parent, or even parents with
a contribution in their name, instead of your own. 

   You may also chose to
contribute in MEMORY of someone (or 2 people) whose deceased in the
same manner as honoring the living.



The
Impact of GISS
   The GISS Project will
completely transform people's lives and how we view humanitarian
work. Reaching the poor, especially in rural areas is a costly endeavor
and one that governments tend to ignore, despite the fact that a
significant portion of the world's population live in rural areas. 


   We will address this
need in a unique way, and make the change to an area permanent. We
will transform the world.    When we help a community, we will create the
infrastructure for them to meet their basic needs and create an
income to run the infrastructure. This means that once established, GISS Technologies will not have to raise more money to support this
region again, barring any disasters, but even these we will likely be
able to handle once the company is robust enough.

   While initially
focusing on free services in rural settings, GISS Technologies will be able to help in
urban settings, and even sell green solutions/services to
industries, and developed areas. The company's income will help with
research and development costs, operational costs, handling disasters
and unexpected costs, and expanding into new regions.



Risks
& Challenges
   Our biggest risk is
that we do not receive the funding we need to proceed. We must pass
our first goal of $40,000 to, among other things, hire an illustrator to create the
promotional material so we can show governments and organizations
what our system can accomplish. 
   Our immediate stretch
goals (Stretch Goal 1 and 2) are also important in accelerating our
time scale and helping people faster, as it will allow us to travel,
do presentations, and access more resources. If we fail to hit our
stretch goals then we will have to move forward more slowly and will
need to search for funding to proceed beyond our initial goals.

   We also face design
hurdles for making the sites smaller and more flexible in regards to
their operating environment. Currently, the technology and designs that have been proven to work require large areas and Sub-Tropic to
Tropic climes. GISS Technologies has designed some innovative
solutions to by-pass these limitations, however we will need to build
our Research & Development facility to test these designs. Until
we can do this, we will be limited to rural areas in warmer climates
for our sites. Fortunately for us, this is where the majority of the
need exists.

IMPACT ON KNOXVILLE COMMUNITY
The Ijams Nature Center is an important and valuable part of the greater Knoxville community. Ijams offers a fun, family-friendly green space that can be accessed by anyone free of charge. Ijams uses the donations it receives to keep the park clean and to support its larger nature preservation goals throughout the local area. The Weed Warriors campaign is one of its many ambitious projects meant to sustain the natural environment and conserve the beauty of Knoxville.

 
HOW ELSE TO HELP
For donors who are not able to give monetary contributions at this time, Ijams offers a multitude of volunteer opportunities for those who are interested in donating their personal help. Those who wish to donate an item instead of money are highly encouraged to donate pieces of equipment needed by Ijams. The best way to get involved is to share information about Ijams to friends, family, and social media. We encourage you to come out and enjoy Ijams’ resources.",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p align=""justify""> Plastics are destroying our oceans and it's way more serious of a problem than any war, political or economic issues. You may have already heard the rumors of this plastic island of floating trash called the Pacific Garbage Patch that is caught up in the strong vortex's of the Northern Gyres.</p>
<p><em>Well... unfortunately it's not a rumor. It's very real.</em></p>

<p align=""justify""> This plastic island of floating trash was once rumored to be twice the size of texas, but upon careful re-examination it is now estimated to be the size of the continental United States. It is so devastating that even if we all stopped using plastics tommorrow, it has already left an environmental impact that will take thousands of years to recover from.</p>

""Well, we can all stop using disposable plastics"" says author, filmmaker, and environmental surfer Veronica Grey. <em>We use these plastic bags for approximately 5 to 10 minutes after we leave the grocery store and then just throw it away.

<p>An emerging environmental concern is the presence of pharmaceuticals in Long Island's Lloyd aquifer and the Magothy aquifer - Long Island's only source of drinking water.  Unwanted medications are being flushed down toilets and poured into drains.  Eventually, these unwanted medications reach our drinking water supply.  Yes, I like my neighbor...I really do...but I don't want my neighbor's unwanted medications in my drinking water. Neither do you. By installing free and convenient pharmaceutical collection receptacles in retail pharmacies you and I (and our neighbors) can take back unwanted medications to any retail pharmacy and responsibly dispose of unwanted medications.  Collection receptacles in retail pharmacies will provide a dual benefit: [1] ENVIRONMENTAL - keep unwanted medications out of our drinking water supply, and [2] SOCIETAL - keep prescription drugs out of the hands of teens and adults who seek to secretly (and sometimes fatally) abuse prescription medications.  The abuse of LEGAL prescription medications kills more people than ILLEGAL drugs such as heroine and cocaine. Each year, more than 1.2 million emergency room visits are caused by illicit abuse of prescription drugs.  Prescription drugs are stolen by family and friends (particulalrly teens) from household medicine cabinets.  The single best thing that can be done, for the ENVIRONMENT and for SOCIETY, is to empty medicine cabinets of unwanted medications and properly dispose of them by depositing the unwanted medications into specially designed and secure collection receptacles at retail pharmacies.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What We Need</strong></p>
<p>The funding goal enables the Lloyd Magothy Water Trust to hire the necessary professionals (attorney and CPA) to incorporate, and apply to the IRS for 501(c)(3) status.  Additionally, the funds will pay a Long Island metal fabrication company to build a specially designed, steel collection receptacle prototype that meets DEA's proposed specifications. The prototype will be demonstrated to charitable foundations and civic organizations (e.g. Elks, Lions, Rotary) for the purpose of procuring additional funding to build and install 100s more additional collection receptacles in retail pharmacies and police stations.  Essentially, the funding sought via Indiegogo is seed money.  Legal $2,000.  501c3 formation $1,500.  Prototype $3,000.  Purchase and installation of the first 3 collection receptacles $3,000. Incineration of collected drugs $500.

<h3></h3>
<p><b>What We Need<br/></b></p>
<p>Two million dollars?! Oh, we know we’re asking for something BIG. </p>
<p>But
it’s in exchange for something huge. A piece of history. A precious resource.  And we only have three weeks to pull this off. </p>
<p>We need your help in raising $2M to save Avalon Springs. </p>
<p>Avalon Springs
is a rediscovered hot springs resort with 11 sources of pure, natural, mineral-rich water,
bubbling from 318 acres of jaw-droppingly gorgeous and historic countryside adjacent
to California’s wine country. In 1876, this land was known as Howard Springs. For
more than 100 years, guests traveled by horse and carriage (!!) from all over
the Bay Area to experience the “medicinal wonders” of the waters. “Nature’s
Mysterious Laboratory,” they dubbed it. Sadly, in 1971 the owners of Howard
Springs ran into financial trouble and its doors were closed until….</p>
<p>…a group led by Michael Woods, chairman of the Napa Valley Tourism
Board, fortuitously discovered the abandoned property—and bought it in 2005.
The big idea was to secure the right partners to redevelop it with modern yet
eco-friendly sensibilities (Yes, we have a permaculture plan!) and rechristen it Avalon Springs, so that people
could once again benefit from its rich history and healing waters. </p>
<p>The ugly reality was that in 2008, the economic (and specifically the real estate market!) collapse hit, making investors impossible to find. And now, despite a growing business in private events, Avalon Springs stands on the brink of facing foreclosure with its $2M loan due on September 10th.<br/></p>
<p>If we can’t raise the money, Avalon
Springs will go on the auction block. It will likely be picked off by a
large commercial chain who would treat the waters with chemicals or by a
moneyed exclusive cult like the one that has kept nearby Siegler Hot Springs
blocked off from the public for over 20 years in honor of their guru. Hot springs are not a dime a dozen; they are found only in finite pockets of this big, blue planet. These are worth saving.<br/></p>
<p>If we DO raise the money, our
plan is to <b>permanently protect and honor this property, creating a place
where we can all enjoy these waters in a natural state for years to come</b>.
Raising this cash will effectively put the property into the right hands so it

Two million dollars?! Oh, we know we’re asking for something BIG. 
But
it’s in exchange for something huge. A piece of history. A precious resource.  And we only have three weeks to pull this off. 
We need your help in raising $2M to save Avalon Springs. 
Avalon Springs
is a rediscovered hot springs resort with 11 sources of pure, natural, mineral-rich water,
bubbling from 318 acres of jaw-droppingly gorgeous and historic countryside adjacent
to California’s wine country. In 1876, this land was known as Howard Springs. For
more than 100 years, guests traveled by horse and carriage (!!) from all over
the Bay Area to experience the “medicinal wonders” of the waters. “Nature’s
Mysterious Laboratory,” they dubbed it. Sadly, in 1971 the owners of Howard
Springs ran into financial trouble and its doors were closed until….
…a group led by Michael Woods, chairman of the Napa Valley Tourism
Board, fortuitously discovered the abandoned property—and bought it in 2005.
The big idea was to secure the right partners to redevelop it with modern yet
eco-friendly sensibilities (Yes, we have a permaculture plan!) and rechristen it Avalon Springs, so that people
could once again benefit from its rich history and healing waters. 
The ugly reality was that in 2008, the economic (and specifically the real estate market!) collapse hit, making investors impossible to find. And now, despite a growing business in private events, Avalon Springs stands on the brink of facing foreclosure with its $2M loan due on September 10th.
If we can’t raise the money, Avalon
Springs will go on the auction block. It will likely be picked off by a
large commercial chain who would treat the waters with chemicals or by a
moneyed exclusive cult like the one that has kept nearby Siegler Hot Springs
blocked off from the public for over 20 years in honor of their guru. Hot springs are not a dime a dozen; they are found only in finite pockets of this big, blue planet. These are worth saving.
If we DO raise the money, our
plan is to permanently protect and honor this property, creating a place
where we can all enjoy these waters in a natural state for years to come.
Raising this cash will effectively put the property into the right hands so it
can be developed into something fitting for the history and natural resources
it embodies—so that YOU can enjoy these legendary waters and experience the
miracle yourself—the miracle YOU will have made possible. A miracle, quite
frankly, this planet needs now more than ever. 
Avalon Springs has all the permits it
needs to realize its vision, including a partnered 501(c)(3) non-profit
organization to hold the educational aspects. We have spent the past 7 years
creating all the plans, permits, and details so now Avalon is READY to go.  Since the economic collapse of

<p><strong>Descripción del problema.</strong></p>
<p>Con el transcurso de los años el hombre ha influenciado de manera directa la inestabilidad y desequilibrio de la naturaleza conllevando a que esta se deteriore de manera significativa hechos manifestados por medio de los desastre naturales, generando miles de muertes humanas y pérdida de ecosistemas naturales.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.5pt;"">Además la falta de conciencia ambiental, destruyendo gran parte de la biodiversidad y afectando de manera directa en ámbitos como: económico, social, educativo, cultural, científico y ambiental.</p>
<p>Esta situación no pasa desapercibida en Colombia y en cada uno de sus departamentos, un claro ejemplo es el Putumayo donde la deforestación en el año 2015 equivale a 9.214 ha siendo el 7,4% de la deforestación nacional (MINAMBIENTE 2012), es así como este departamento ha desviado su esencia, ya que es reconocido por tener áreas que presentan alto nivel de biodiversidad que buscan ser aprovechadas de forma sostenible por muchos propietarios de fincas que han optado por darle una percepción distinta a sus tierras con el fin de contrarrestar algunas problemáticas que afectan su desarrollo.</p>
<p>Evidenciado lo anterior se tiene el caso de la finca Vaguara en municipio de Mocoa departamento del Putumayo donde se observa que su mayor problemática es la posible utilización del territorio para explotación de suelos,  Cría de Ganado y explotación maderera indiscriminada en propiedad, lo que perjudica de manera directa y constante la regeneración y recuperación del ecosistema, fuentes hídricas presentes y en si el entorno, siendo requisito esencial adquirir el predio y ser categorizados como reserva natural de la sociedad civil incursionando en el aprovechamiento turístico.</p>

<p><strong>Justificación/ Impacto del proyecto</strong></p>
<p>La explotación  Territorial es una problemática que requiere de una alternativa viable y precisa para ser solucionada, por ello es indispensable proteger  el estado de los recursos hídricos, en el caso de la finca Vaguara ubicada en la vereda san José del pepino kilómetro 7 vía villa garzón del municipio de Mocoa departamento del putumayo es valiosa porque aporta a nuestra Colombia y en especial al Putumayo, un lugar en donde se puede aprender, sentir, vivir a fondo nuestra cultura medicinal y ancestral, importa porque estamos protegiendo un enorme territorio de 12 hectáreas de selva nativa amazónica, igualmente, vivenciar una experiencia consigo mismo y con la naturaleza tanto para esta generación como para las venideras, ya que este territorio no será comercializado ni expuesto a fines diferentes al ecoturismo y la sanación.  </p>
<p>El proyecto ambiental es orientado desde el etnoturismo  con un enfoque hacia  la permacultura , con el fin de mostrar las capacidades de auto sostenibilidad, sembrando conciencia por  la protección del territorio , implementando una travesía que impacte positivamente al visitante, encaminado en el autoconocimiento con la experiencia única de sanación tradicional indígena, meditación , conciencia personal y ambiental.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Impacto ambiental, social y ético</strong></p>
<p>El enfoque de este proyecto genera un impacto ambiental positivo, pues lo que se pretende es realizar un proyecto de turismo y medicina que no busca fines de explotación, sino una línea directa a la conservación y aprovechamiento consiente de los recursos forestales en conjunto con la protección de las fuentes hídricas y de la fauna silvestre sumándose en la labor de la mitigación del cambio climático; logrando que esta zona sea vinculada a Reservas naturales de la sociedad civil.</p>
<p>Según Parques Nacionales Naturales de Colombia (PNN S/F) una Reserva Natural de la Sociedad Civil (RNSC) “Es un predio que por voluntad y decisión de los propietarios de las tierras, pretenden que sea convertido en una reserva natural; su objetivo es crear un ecosistema o hábitat natural bajo parámetros de conservación y restauración y producción sostenible, que resalte la iniciativa que tienen sus propietarios la cual puede influir para que otros se  vinculan con este tipo de modalidades como personas que conservan los recursos naturales buscando el bienestar de local y regional; para lo  anterior juega un papel muy importante la instauración de Iwoka natural, un proyecto que busca que todas las actividades estén enfocados en la práctica de valores como la responsabilidad, puntualidad, estudio, constancia, carácter, concentración, formación, activismo, enfocado a la conservación del medio ambiente y los recursos que este brinda.</p>
<p>Vaguara en totalidad de extensión posee 12 hectáreas, nacederos de agua, plantaciones de árboles originarios de la zona, cultivos de chontaduro, plátano maduro, yuca, uva caimarona entre otras</p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>PLAN DE ACCION</strong></p>
<p>Para dar paso a la elaboración del proyecto, primeramente se adquirirá el predio Vaguara Y Prestaremos servicio de camping ecológico, piscina natural con agua potable natural de la  montaña de la finca, guíanza a los lugares etno turísticos de nuestra tierra y nuestra región. Se utiliza también una parte del  reciclaje como alternativa para solventar la comida de animales, talleres de reciclaje y manufactura transformando los  materiales que desechamos, cursos de construcción ecológica auto sostenibilidad con la comunidad y aprendizaje zootécnico.</p>
<p> Se presta servicio de sanación por medio de terapias modernas y tradicionales, servicio de audio terapia, masajes holísticos, tratamiento con plantas aromáticas, tratamiento psicológico y acompañamiento profesional, medicina tradicional con plantas sagradas Nativas del Putumayo, sanación tradicional indígena y terapia de spa. También la piscicultura, la cría de gallinas ponedoras.

 ELEMENTOS DE LA PROPUESTA INFORMACION GENERAL DE LA PROPUESTA

Tema/título provisional: 
COMPRA DE TERRITORIO PARA LA POSIBLE CONSTITUCION DE LA RESERVA NATURAL DE LA SOCIEDAD CIVIL EN LA FINCA VAGUARA UBICADA EN LA VEREDA SAN JOSE DEL PEPINO KILOMETRO 7 VIA VILLAGARZON DEL MUNICIPIO DE MOCOA DEPARTAMENTO DEL PUTUMAYO.


Descripción del problema.
Con el transcurso de los años el hombre ha influenciado de manera directa la inestabilidad y desequilibrio de la naturaleza conllevando a que esta se deteriore de manera significativa hechos manifestados por medio de los desastre naturales, generando miles de muertes humanas y pérdida de ecosistemas naturales.
Además la falta de conciencia ambiental, destruyendo gran parte de la biodiversidad y afectando de manera directa en ámbitos como: económico, social, educativo, cultural, científico y ambiental.
Esta situación no pasa desapercibida en Colombia y en cada uno de sus departamentos, un claro ejemplo es el Putumayo donde la deforestación en el año 2015 equivale a 9.214 ha siendo el 7,4% de la deforestación nacional (MINAMBIENTE 2012), es así como este departamento ha desviado su esencia, ya que es reconocido por tener áreas que presentan alto nivel de biodiversidad que buscan ser aprovechadas de forma sostenible por muchos propietarios de fincas que han optado por darle una percepción distinta a sus tierras con el fin de contrarrestar algunas problemáticas que afectan su desarrollo.
Evidenciado lo anterior se tiene el caso de la finca Vaguara en municipio de Mocoa departamento del Putumayo donde se observa que su mayor problemática es la posible utilización del territorio para explotación de suelos,  Cría de Ganado y explotación maderera indiscriminada en propiedad, lo que perjudica de manera directa y constante la regeneración y recuperación del ecosistema, fuentes hídricas presentes y en si el entorno, siendo requisito esencial adquirir el predio y ser categorizados como reserva natural de la sociedad civil incursionando en el aprovechamiento turístico.


 
Objetivo General:
Adquirir un territorio ancestral de 12 hectáreas y proteger los recursos forestales, hídricos y de especies en la finca Vaguara ubicada en la vereda San José del Pepino kilómetro 7 vía villa garzón del municipio de Mocoa departamento del Putumayo para contribuir a su constitución como reserva natural de la sociedad civil y instauración de proyecto Iwoka Natural.



Objetivos Específicos:

Zonificar el área de la finca Vaguara ubicada en la vereda San José del Pepino.
Adquirir el Valor necesario para la adquisición del territorio y la implementación de Iwoka Natural.
Solicitar Presencia de organizaciones ecológicas para la instauración de la Reserva.
Evaluar y Clasificar la riqueza y la distribución de las especies forestales en la finca Vaguara.
Creación de Comitivas de incentivo ecológico, recolección y manejo de basuras de la zona publica aledaña a la reserva.
Implementación de Etnoturismo y prácticas de Turismo Ecológico
Trabajo con las Autoridades Locales y con los Turistas para dar a conocer nuestra iniciativa al Mundo.
Establecer en la Finca la Permacultura   
Generar empleo y emprendimiento 
Educación y formación cultural artística y ecológica en niños
Implementar escuela de teatro, cine, circo, música y manualidades, involucrando las madres tejedoras para los talleres y gente de Mocoa o Villa Garzón .     
Implementación de eventos con entidades y colectivos ambientales, artísticos, gubernamentales y comunidades indígenas, dentro del territorio ancestral.



 
Justificación/ Impacto del proyecto
La explotación  Territorial es una problemática que requiere de una alternativa viable y precisa para ser solucionada, por ello es indispensable proteger  el estado de los recursos hídricos, en el caso de la finca Vaguara ubicada en la vereda san José del pepino kilómetro 7 vía villa garzón del municipio de Mocoa departamento del putumayo es valiosa porque aporta a nuestra Colombia y en especial al Putumayo, un lugar en donde se puede aprender, sentir, vivir a fondo nuestra cultura medicinal y ancestral, importa porque estamos protegiendo un enorme territorio de 12 hectáreas de selva nativa amazónica, igualmente, vivenciar una experiencia consigo mismo y con la naturaleza tanto para esta generación como para las venideras, ya que este territorio no será comercializado ni expuesto a fines diferentes al ecoturismo y la sanación.  
El proyecto ambiental es orientado desde el etnoturismo  con un enfoque hacia  la permacultura , con el fin de mostrar las capacidades de auto sostenibilidad, sembrando conciencia por  la protección del territorio , implementando una travesía que impacte positivamente al visitante, encaminado en el autoconocimiento con la experiencia única de sanación tradicional indígena, meditación , conciencia personal y ambiental.
 
Impacto ambiental, social y ético
El enfoque de este proyecto genera un impacto ambiental positivo, pues lo que se pretende es realizar un proyecto de turismo y medicina que no busca fines de explotación, sino una línea directa a la conservación y aprovechamiento consiente de los recursos forestales en conjunto con la protección de las fuentes hídricas y de la fauna silvestre sumándose en la labor de la mitigación del cambio climático; logrando que esta zona sea vinculada a Reservas naturales de la sociedad civil.
Según Parques Nacionales Naturales de Colombia (PNN S/F) una Reserva Natural de la Sociedad Civil (RNSC) “Es un predio que por voluntad y decisión de los propietarios de las tierras, pretenden que sea convertido en una reserva natural; su objetivo es crear un ecosistema o hábitat natural bajo parámetros de conservación y restauración y producción sostenible, que resalte la iniciativa que tienen sus propietarios la cual puede influir para que otros se  vinculan con este tipo de modalidades como personas que conservan los recursos naturales buscando el bienestar de local y regional; para lo  anterior juega un papel muy importante la instauración de Iwoka natural, un proyecto que busca que todas las actividades estén enfocados en la práctica de valores como la responsabilidad, puntualidad, estudio, constancia, carácter, concentración, formación, activismo, enfocado a la conservación del medio ambiente y los recursos que este brinda.
Vaguara en totalidad de extensión posee 12 hectáreas, nacederos de agua, plantaciones de árboles originarios de la zona, cultivos de chontaduro, plátano maduro, yuca, uva caimarona entre otras
 


 
PLAN DE ACCION
Para dar paso a la elaboración del proyecto, primeramente se adquirirá el predio Vaguara Y Prestaremos servicio de camping ecológico, piscina natural con agua potable natural de la  montaña de la finca, guíanza a los lugares etno turísticos de nuestra tierra y nuestra región. Se utiliza también una parte del  reciclaje como alternativa para solventar la comida de animales, talleres de reciclaje y manufactura transformando los  materiales que desechamos, cursos de construcción ecológica auto sostenibilidad con la comunidad y aprendizaje zootécnico.
 Se presta servicio de sanación por medio de terapias modernas y tradicionales, servicio de audio terapia, masajes holísticos, tratamiento con plantas aromáticas, tratamiento psicológico y acompañamiento profesional, medicina tradicional con plantas sagradas Nativas del Putumayo, sanación tradicional indígena y terapia de spa. También la piscicultura, la cría de gallinas ponedoras. Con los productos antes mencionados se colocan a la venta al público con el fin de obtener ganancias económicas y por ende subsanar los servicios de mantenimiento básico que demanda la finca.
El sitio ha permitido tener auto sostenibilidad amigable con el ambiente a través de los siguientes métodos de ingreso económico: cultivos de plátanos, chontaduros  y árboles frutales como el banano uvas caimaronas originarias de la selva amazónica, guayabas, guamas, madroños, piña, aguacate, café orgánico y tostado.
También se creó un espacio para venta de pizza artesanal en leña, colección de instrumentos para música en vivo, cuentos, fogata y presentaciones artísticas de las personas viajeras que visitan nuestro lugar, permitiendo de esta manera recrear, compartir, generar ganancia económica, dejar huellas para los que vienen y contar experiencias de sanación vividas tanto personales y grupales. 


La ayuda de los colaboradores es de un gran beneficio para que este proyecto se lleve a cabo y se ejecute con la finalidad y meta propuesta. Con el dinero recaudado los colaboradores tendrán la oportunidad de participar en la protección activa de un enorme territorio el cual fue destinado varios siglos atrás como territorio de sanación ancestral y hoy con el valor aportado de cada uno daremos un impacto social con la comunidad positivo en la protección de la zona para esta generación y las generaciones venideras en busca de sanación e integración con la Naturaleza del bajo Putumayo.
La propuesta concreta es o adquirimos este territorio para instaurar IWOKA NATURAL  y continuar preservándolo como sitio Etnoturistico y de sanación o se convierte en  explotación territorial y perdemos con ello la oportunidad de sanar a muchas personas que de verdad lo necesitan.
Inversionista del proyecto: tendrá acceso al  lugar de manera prioritaria cada vez que quiera disfrutar del espacio, tendrá alojamiento, tratamiento medicinal y terapéutico, guías  a los lugares turísticos ancestrales,  clases de tejido, se realizará un evento periódicamente donde  será invitado a conocer y compartir de nuestros resultados económicos y de impacto social,
Podrán solicitar él envió de informe periódico, informándose de nuestros avances y además compartirán la adopción de hectáreas de árboles de manera remota o directa
El valor será de carácter histórico y de protección medio ambiental, no prometemos ganancia económica ya que el objetivo de nuestro proyecto es lograr que el territorio sea ingresado a Reserva Natural de la Sociedad Civil (RNSC) (predio que por voluntad y decisión de los propietarios de las tierras, pretenden que sea convertido en una reserva natural)
El carácter de retribución económica es de valor histórico y su beneficio es de carácter pro activo para la preservación de nuestra biosfera y nuestro territorio de Sanación siendo Putumayo importante cuna de medicina ancestral y flora única en el planeta tierra.
Proyecto Iwoka Natural establecerá una  comunicación directa con nuestro inversionista y actuaremos con resultados, la implementación de la reserva Natural es la prioridad.

<h3><b>What is ARETHA?</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p><span>ARETHA (AiR Exchange THermal Assembly) is a sustainable device to produce hot water from the sun, made with low cost materials and without any particular expertise. Everybody, everywhere, can build an ARETHA solar thermal collector for his needs. Traditional photovoltaic or thermal solar panels are too expensive for most people in developing countries, especially in small and isolated villages, because of import and production high costs. On the contrary, ARETHA panel can be made from local material: wood, wool, car radiators, transparent plastic panels or glass.</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/571951/files/20140511112812-DSC05624.jpg?1399832892"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;""><br/></span></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">Paolo Bonelli and Franco Mantega, two retired Italian researchers, started an experimental activity on this kind of collector since one year ago.

Every car has to dissipate the heat produce by the engine. This function is performed by the radiator which promotes the thermal exchange between the water circulating into the engine and the external air. In the ARETHA system the radiator works in the opposite way: it transfers heat from the hot air, produced by the Sun, to the cold water of a primary closed circuit. Hot water is then stored into a good thermal insulated tank, near to the panel. A secondary open circuit, made by a pipe  submerged into the tank, heats the clean water that can be used for our purposes.</span><br/></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;""></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/571957/files/20140418234213-Diapo10.jpg?1399833409"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p>The ARETHA box can be made by wood or other material covered with a thermally insulating material as: glass wool or natural sheep ones. The front side of the box must be transparent to the Sun rays. Here we could use glass or plastic, but it is important that this side is thermally insulated too. Hollow poly-carbonate is a good solution. Glass may be, but it is heavier and more expensive.</p>
<p>Car radiator power must be set proportionally to the ARETHA exposed surface. The radiator must have its original fan or a similar one. A simple circulation pump provide the water flowing into the primary circuit. Yes, ARETHA needs electricity, but fan and pump power consumption is very low compared to the thermal energy gained in heating water.</p><p><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/568482/files/20140509101844-IMG_4262.jpg?1399655924"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>ARETHA is controlled by Arduino, the worldwide famous open hardware micro-controller board. The main purpose of the ARETHA control system is to switch on the pump and the fan only when the temperature difference between air and water rises over a defined threshold. Arduino measures temperatures in different parts of ARETHA by means of digital sensor chips as Dallas DS18B20. A DataLogger Shield provides for archiving information on a SD card and, eventually, an Ethernet Shield sends data on Internet.  Electrical scheme and software are open source.<br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/541808/files/20140429023554-ArduinoControl4.png?1398764154"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p>
<p>A  first experimental prototype of about 10 sq m  has been built in Milan (Italy) and it still works.

</p><h3><b>Dettagli tecnici su ARETHA</b></h3>
<p><i>La logica di ARETHA consiste nel produrre aria calda in una scatola che scambi il suo calore con l’acqua fluente, in un componente ad alta efficienza: un radiatore di automobile.

<p></p></div>","What is ARETHA?

ARETHA (AiR Exchange THermal Assembly) is a sustainable device to produce hot water from the sun, made with low cost materials and without any particular expertise. Everybody, everywhere, can build an ARETHA solar thermal collector for his needs. Traditional photovoltaic or thermal solar panels are too expensive for most people in developing countries, especially in small and isolated villages, because of import and production high costs. On the contrary, ARETHA panel can be made from local material: wood, wool, car radiators, transparent plastic panels or glass.Paolo Bonelli and Franco Mantega, two retired Italian researchers, started an experimental activity on this kind of collector since one year ago. Along this period they obtained encouraging scientific results.
Now they ask your help to make a new ARETHA prototype (The ARETHA Project) with more recycling materials, as: used wood pallets and sheep wool. Their goal is to write down a tutorial, rich of  pictures, data and building steps, in order to allow everybody  to make his own ARETHA. Paolo and Franco also wish to grow up a community of ARETHA makers, that will share projects and experience.
Cos'è ARETHA?
ARETHA (AiR Exchange THermal Assembly)  è un dispositivo sostenibile per produrre acqua calda dal sole, fatto con materiali a basso costo e senza particolare esperienza.  Ognuno, ovunque nel mondo, può costruire un collettore solare termico ARETHA per le sue necessità. I pannelli solari tradizionali, termici o fotovoltaici, sono troppo costosi per la maggior parte delle persone nei paesi in via di sviluppo, specialmente nei villaggi piccoli e isolati, a causa degli alti costi d’importazione e produzione. Al contrario, un pannello ARETHA può essere fatto con materiali locali: legno, lana, radiatori di auto, pannelli di plastica trasparente o di vetro.Paolo Bonelli e Franco Mantega, due ricercatori italiani in pensione, da circa un anno hanno iniziato un’attività sperimentale su questo genere di collettori. Durante questo periodo essi hanno ottenuto risultati scientifici incoraggianti. 
Ora chiedono il tuo aiuto per costruire un nuovo prototipo di ARETHA con una quota maggiore di materiali di recupero, quali: bancali di legno usati e lana di pecora. Il loro obiettivo è quello di scrivere un tutorial, ricco di immagini, dati e singoli passi di costruzione, con lo scopo di permettere a chiunque di fare il proprio ARETHA. A questo scopo nasce ARETHA Project.Paolo e Franco intendono dare l'avvio ad una comunità on line di costruttori di ARETHA, dove poter scambiare progetti ed esperienze.Technical details about ARETHAThe ARETHA concept consists in producing hot air in a box that exchange its heat with the water flowing in a high efficiency component: the car radiator. Every car has to dissipate the heat produce by the engine. This function is performed by the radiator which promotes the thermal exchange between the water circulating into the engine and the external air. In the ARETHA system the radiator works in the opposite way: it transfers heat from the hot air, produced by the Sun, to the cold water of a primary closed circuit. Hot water is then stored into a good thermal insulated tank, near to the panel. A secondary open circuit, made by a pipe  submerged into the tank, heats the clean water that can be used for our purposes.The ARETHA box can be made by wood or other material covered with a thermally insulating material as: glass wool or natural sheep ones. The front side of the box must be transparent to the Sun rays. Here we could use glass or plastic, but it is important that this side is thermally insulated too. Hollow poly-carbonate is a good solution. Glass may be, but it is heavier and more expensive.
Car radiator power must be set proportionally to the ARETHA exposed surface. The radiator must have its original fan or a similar one. A simple circulation pump provide the water flowing into the primary circuit. Yes, ARETHA needs electricity, but fan and pump power consumption is very low compared to the thermal energy gained in heating water.ARETHA is controlled by Arduino, the worldwide famous open hardware micro-controller board. The main purpose of the ARETHA control system is to switch on the pump and the fan only when the temperature difference between air and water rises over a defined threshold. Arduino measures temperatures in different parts of ARETHA by means of digital sensor chips as Dallas DS18B20. A DataLogger Shield provides for archiving information on a SD card and, eventually, an Ethernet Shield sends data on Internet.  Electrical scheme and software are open source.
A  first experimental prototype of about 10 sq m  has been built in Milan (Italy) and it still works. It provided a lot of data that has allowed a better understanding of its operating principles and how to optimize the collector energy efficiency. This prototype has been funded and encouraged by a no-profit association: CISE2007.
Dettagli tecnici su ARETHA
La logica di ARETHA consiste nel produrre aria calda in una scatola che scambi il suo calore con l’acqua fluente, in un componente ad alta efficienza: un radiatore di automobile. Ogni auto deve dissipare il calore prodotto dal suo motore. Questa funzione è soddisfatta dal radiatore che promuove lo scambio termico tra l’acqua circolante nel motore e l’aria esterna. Nel sistema ARETHA il radiatore lavora all’incontrario: trasferisce calore dall’aria calda, prodotta dal sole, all’acqua fredda del circuito primario chiuso. L’acqua calda è quindi immagazzinata in un serbatoio ben isolato termicamente, vicino al pannello. Un secondo circuito, aperto, fatto da un tubo immerso nel serbatoio, scalda l’acqua pulita che può essere usata per i nostri scopi (acqua sanitaria, serre,etc.)La scatola di ARETHA può essere fatta da legno o altri materiali, ricoperti con isolanti termici, quali lana di pecora o di vetro. La parete frontale della scatola deve essere trasparente ai raggi solari. Per questa si può usare vetro o una lastra di plastica, ma è importante che anche questa parete sia abbastanza isolata termicamente. Una lastra di policarbonato alveolare è una buona soluzione. Anche il vetro può essere usato, ma costa di più ed è più pesante.
La potenza del radiatore di auto deve essere proporzionata alla superficie esposta di ARETHA. Il radiatore deve avere il suo ventilatore originale o uno simile. Una semplice pompa “circolatore” provvede a far circolare l’acqua nel circuito primario. Sì, ARETHA necessita di elettricità, ma il consumo della pompa e del ventilatore sono minimi confrontati al guadagno di energia nell’acqua calda.
ARETHA è controllato da Arduino, la scheda a microcontrollore open-hardware famosa in tutto il mondo. Lo scopo principale di questo sistema di controllo è quello di accendere pompa e ventilatore solo quando la differenza di temperatura tra aria e acqua oltrepassa una determinata soglia. Arduino misura le temperature in diversi punti di ARETHA per mezzo di sensori integrati digitali, come i Dallas DS18B20. Una scheda Data Logger provvede ad archiviare i dati su una SD card e, opzionalmente, una scheda Ethernet invia i dati su Internet. Schemi elettrici e software sono open-source.
Un primo prototipo sperimentale di circa 10 m2, è stato costruito a Milano ed è tuttora funzionante. Ha prodotto una grande quantità di dati che hanno permesso una migliore comprensione dei principi di funzionamento e di come ottimizzare l’efficienza energetica.Questo prototipo è stato finanziato e incoraggiato dall’associazione no-profit CISE2007.What We Need & What You GetThe ARETHA Project intends to demonstrate the feasibility of a 6 sq m collector, made by pallets, sheep wool and other easy to find materials. The collector will be built by no-specialized people, during the workshop  Trasformatorio, an international laboratory focusing on all that is related to site-specific and sustainable performance. The location will be the village of Montalbano Elicona (Sicily-Italy). The prototype will work there for a reasonable period in order to collect data. During the building phase, all the steps will be reported. At the end of the Project, a tutorial document will be edited and shared on Internet.
The fund campaign goal is $ 12000 (USD), that we need to fund the cost of the materials for this prototype, all the costs related to the documentation, perks and travel for one of the authors and the management of a dedicated  web site.
We don’t want to rise money for anything else. The results of this campaign should be:
· A detailed tutorial on how to make a 6 sq m ARETHA collector by recycled materials;
· A web site and a forum  to provide information about every ARETHA collector built by people, allowing them to exchange ideas and experience.
This effort cannot be done without money! ARETHA cannot become a commercial product because we want the people learn to make it yourself, especially in developing countries.
You can help us even only participating to the ARETHA community with your suggestion and telling us your experience in making solar thermal collector.

in. We have Successfully done research in many areas and achieved our success
in our way by helping people.

</p><p>We now want
to push ourselves to achieve something bigger that will help the world in a
major way. Our Research project is to Reduce Air Conditioning or AC cost by
atleast 5-20%.We will focus our research In Home Air Conditioning in Window AC
and Split AC. Today Global warming and Global climate change has put lot of
load on Air Conditioning. Developed countries as well as developing countries
are now hugely dependent on AC cooling. This is also creating a huge pollution
problem very high carbon emissions increasing more carbon foot print day by day. </p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">According
to a 2012 report a rough estimate of all Air Conditioning system Including

<p>This is a
research project to lower the electricity cost of AC by 5-20%. We have done
some experiments of our own and seen some promising results but to achieve more
and greater results we need to meet our funding goal. This will be our minimum
requirement. The money will mostly go in research to purchase expensive testing
equipments for Analyzing designs of Air
Conditioners and the whole Mechanism of Air
Conditioners. We want to take a completely new approach to Residential Air
Conditioning. All this is going to cost. We have to Import some equipments
which may be necessary as the Research goes ahead. We already have some Designs
and concepts on which we have worked but to execute it we need atleast meet our
funding goal.We are very optimistic with our experiments that we have already
done and shown some promising results So we are here on this crowdfunding
platform to urge you to support us by your contributions.</p>
<p>We will
atleast spend whole one year on the Research Our whole time and energy will be
to achieve 5-20% saving on electricity cost.The time period of research depends
on when it is achieved it may take one year or less depending on as research
progresses. In this time we will make our prototype and take valuable
measurements needed for Research.</p>
<p>As of now
we cannot disclose our concepts and designs on which we got promising results
because we don’t have any copyrights or patents on that.</p><p><br/></p>
<p>What is in it for me?</p><p><br/></p>
<p>If you
support our Campaign you are helping us to create something good for the
world.This is a time of crisis on pollution level our whole ecology is disturbed
if we could make it a little bit better our future generations will benefit from
it and also we all will be able to save money on Air Conditioning Electricity. We
personally think if we could do something better for the whole world that is
the most rewarding feeling one can get.</p>

<p>Impact of our Research</p><p><br/></p><p>Today our
world uses more than one Trillion kilowatt-hour annually. U.S.A. Alone uses a
lot of electricity just for Air Conditioning compared to the whole world and
other developing economies in Southeast Asia<span> 
are buying more and more AC’s according to the climate change. India and
China are becoming the largest consumer of home Air Conditioning Systems
whether Window AC or Split AC. Middle East is already dependent on AC’s. Lot of
the electricity generated is from coal increasing Carbon emissions. According
to some reports majority of electricity is used for AC’s for cooling. Mumbai a
financial capital of India uses 40% of the electricity only on AC’s for cooling.
Despite having electricity connection in many parts of the world there is still
major cut offs and blackout only to meet AC electricity needs. Unfortunately
other renewable energy systems like Solar energy etc. are also not able to
fulfill the electricity needs because the demands are rising constantly.</span></p><p><br/><span></span></p><p><span></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1445613178/ux1xuyvowtue2ay4rgjz.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p></p><p>If we succeed
in our Research we can save 5-20% on AC Electricity bill which will help the whole
world by reducing Carbon emissions which will provide more cleaner air.We save
money on AC Electricity bill which saves our money.In conclusion it helps
Individuals as well as the whole world. <br/></p><p><br/></p>
<p>Risk and Challenges</p><p><br/></p>
<p>Whatever Success
we have found in our experiments we are very optimistic but in Research We want to
stress that any Research is the most demanding of all whether its money,time or
energy.Very big companies shy away from research as there is always
uncertainity. We will try new methods which will help to reach our goal. Our
reaching the funding goal is very important to us as only then we will be able to do extensive Research. So support us in reaching our funding goal.We
will be investing lot of time and energy.</p><p><br/></p>

and Split AC. Today Global warming and Global climate change has put lot of
load on Air Conditioning. Developed countries as well as developing countries
are now hugely dependent on AC cooling. This is also creating a huge pollution
problem very high carbon emissions increasing more carbon foot print day by day. According
to a 2012 report a rough estimate of all Air Conditioning system Including
Residential and Commercial use Worldwide use of electricity consumption is
around one trillion kilowatt-Hour annually and is continuously growing at huge
rate and most of the electricity is generated by coal thus increasing carbon emissions
and creating more pollution and destroying the ecology of the world.
Our goal
here is to improve the designs and mechanisms of the AC systems that will surely
save atleast 5-20% electricity which also help in reducing carbon emissions and
reduce Pollution and save our ecology for the best for all.
We are very
very excited in this research and your Contributions will help in changing the
world which will definitely help everyone. Join us in OUR Journey. We are sure
you will appreciate yourselves.OUR APPROACH
This is a
research project to lower the electricity cost of AC by 5-20%. We have done
some experiments of our own and seen some promising results but to achieve more
and greater results we need to meet our funding goal. This will be our minimum
requirement. The money will mostly go in research to purchase expensive testing
equipments for Analyzing designs of Air
Conditioners and the whole Mechanism of Air
Conditioners. We want to take a completely new approach to Residential Air
Conditioning. All this is going to cost. We have to Import some equipments
which may be necessary as the Research goes ahead. We already have some Designs
and concepts on which we have worked but to execute it we need atleast meet our
funding goal.We are very optimistic with our experiments that we have already
done and shown some promising results So we are here on this crowdfunding
platform to urge you to support us by your contributions.
We will
atleast spend whole one year on the Research Our whole time and energy will be
to achieve 5-20% saving on electricity cost.The time period of research depends
on when it is achieved it may take one year or less depending on as research
progresses. In this time we will make our prototype and take valuable
measurements needed for Research.
As of now
we cannot disclose our concepts and designs on which we got promising results
because we don’t have any copyrights or patents on that.
What is in it for me?
If you
support our Campaign you are helping us to create something good for the
world.This is a time of crisis on pollution level our whole ecology is disturbed
if we could make it a little bit better our future generations will benefit from
it and also we all will be able to save money on Air Conditioning Electricity. We
personally think if we could do something better for the whole world that is
the most rewarding feeling one can get.
If you
Support us we have made some PERKS, just our way to say Thanks to you.                                                                  As PERKS we
have Personally Composed Nature Relaxing Music.All the tracks are in mp3 format
and all the tracks are different. It will help you in stress and there are lot
other benefits of listening to Nature Music.We have put lot of effort in making
these audio tracks.We are confident you will like it.
Impact of our ResearchToday our
world uses more than one Trillion kilowatt-hour annually. U.S.A. Alone uses a
lot of electricity just for Air Conditioning compared to the whole world and
other developing economies in Southeast Asia 
are buying more and more AC’s according to the climate change. India and
China are becoming the largest consumer of home Air Conditioning Systems
whether Window AC or Split AC. Middle East is already dependent on AC’s. Lot of
the electricity generated is from coal increasing Carbon emissions. According
to some reports majority of electricity is used for AC’s for cooling. Mumbai a
financial capital of India uses 40% of the electricity only on AC’s for cooling.
Despite having electricity connection in many parts of the world there is still
major cut offs and blackout only to meet AC electricity needs. Unfortunately
other renewable energy systems like Solar energy etc. are also not able to
fulfill the electricity needs because the demands are rising constantly.

If we succeed
in our Research we can save 5-20% on AC Electricity bill which will help the whole
world by reducing Carbon emissions which will provide more cleaner air.We save
money on AC Electricity bill which saves our money.In conclusion it helps
Individuals as well as the whole world. 
Risk and Challenges
Whatever Success
we have found in our experiments we are very optimistic but in Research We want to
stress that any Research is the most demanding of all whether its money,time or
energy.Very big companies shy away from research as there is always
uncertainity. We will try new methods which will help to reach our goal. Our
reaching the funding goal is very important to us as only then we will be able to do extensive Research. So support us in reaching our funding goal.We
will be investing lot of time and energy.
Other Ways you can Support us
Please help
us by spreading the word and letting everyone know this World changing Research
we are working now.  We are looking
forward for your Support, With Your Support We will Definitely succeed.

According to the American Bird Conservancy (ABC) free-roaming cats are directly responsible for the extinction of 33 species worldwide. 

We now know that free-roaming cats kill up to 4 billion birds each year in the United States alone.


Outdoor cats have drastically reduced lifespans due to automotive accidents, increased risk of altercations with dogs or other cats, cruelty by humans, exposure to illness and parasites, and predation by wildlife.



How We Will Accomplish ThisWe seek to address these issues through education and hands-on activism. What does this entail? Five main ways will be used to achieve these goals.

We will trap, neuter, and return feral cats and maintain their colonies. This includes providing regular, good quality food, medical care and regular check-ups, and shelter.
Outdoor cats which are sociable or young will be transitioned to indoor living by volunteers and fostered by these same people until they've adjusted and are ready to be adopted out.
We will have strict adoption standards. The foster will do a home visit and sit down with each resident of the house to discuss their feelings on bringing the cat home.

None of these activities are allowed in their hometowns in the Fukushima region due to the contamination.

However, it stays active for a long time, and somehow recycles itself, in the natural environment within the soil, water, plants and other organic materials and living things.  Parks, rivers, fields, forests and beaches are highly susceptible.  These are the places that absorb and hold more radiation.  There are hot spots like these throughout Fukushima and some neighboring regions.  Sadly, such wonderful opportunities to play in the natural environments have been taken away from these children.  There are 7-year-old children in the Fukushima region that have spent their entire lives indoors, and have never played in nature due to the severity of the contamination.</p><p>Here is an English movie by NPO Mother's Radiation Lab Fukushima.  We work closely with this organization. This footage accurately describes the kind of situation Fukushima mothers are faced with, and the high-level of anxiety and stress they have to deal with.</p><p><a href=""https://tarachineiwaki.org/english"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://tarachineiwaki.org/english</a></p><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/dwq8bEZnJhU?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div><p> </p><h3>Living in Radioactive Contamination</h3><p>Radiation exists normally in small amounts in nature.  We are exposed to approximately 0.04μSv from the soil.  The Japanese government sets the safe standard for living with air radiation exposure at 0.23μSv per hour. </p><p>In 2015, holding the radiation counter in our hands, we checked out a couple of parks in Koriyama, a city with a population of 330,000, about 60km away from the nuclear power plant.  The following movie shows the readings.  The numbers are ""μSv per hour"".  According to the government guideline, the maximum radiation one can live in is 0.23. You can see these parks, right in the middle of the residential area with schools, showing far more radiation than normal radiation levels, and in many spots, higher radiation than the government guideline.</p><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/5tK31dnK440?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div><p> </p><p>You might say this is not severe enough radiation to cause immediate death or illness.  It is said that 2000mSv of radiation in a short time would lead to a 5% mortality rate.  If you stay a whole year in a hot spot of 0.4μSv per hour at that corner of the park, you would be exposed to 3.5mSv per year.  That may seem to be a small amount compared to the dangerous 2000mSv level.  It’s true that it’s not of immediate danger, but accumulated radiation exposure over time can damage DNA and greatly risk one’s health.  Also you can't see, smell or feel radiation so it may go unnoticed until it’s too late.  If you live in this region radiation is an everyday threat.  You should avoid the exposure as much as possible, including internal radiation dosages through inhalation and ingestion of contaminated foods.</p><p>You may wonder why people are still living in such an environment.  Some families have moved out of Fukushima.  The population has reduced by 8% since 2011.  Yet, the majority has stayed in Fukushima for various family and financial reasons.  Moreover, many have moved into Fukushima because the government recovery projects are creating new jobs.  There's an unspoken code for the majority of the residents, ""We have to live here anyway, so let's not talk about radiation.""</p><p>In the meantime, conscientious mothers have to be safe by buying expensive foods from far away and avoiding cheaper local foods in fear of contamination.  Mothers need to keep telling their children, ""Don't touch that.""

The children spend 10 to 14 days in our facility enjoying various programs such as exploring the beautiful tropical beaches, observing small creature in the creeks, and simply running and playing in nature. None of these activities are allowed in their hometowns in the Fukushima region due to the contamination. We also provide healthy, handmade meals with safe local food.There is a study that states if someone spends 3 weeks removed from radioactive exposure, most of the radioactivity will dissipate from the body. We encourage all children to visit Kumi-no-Sato twice a year to improve their health and wellbeing.All our operating funds come from donations around the world with some government and corporate funding. This allows children to travel and participate in our program with little expense.  We also rely heavily on volunteers to operate this program.  We organize 14 to 16 programs a year, depending on our budget.  We run 2 separate programs, one for children from the age of 6 to 15, and one for pre-school children and infants with their mothers.  Each program costs about USD26,500 to USD44,200.We are asking for donations to reach our goal of USD20,000 to pay these expenses.Thank you very much for your interest.  I would really appreciate if you would spend a little time reading the article below to better understand the problems we are facing in Fukushima. 7 Years from the Fukushima Nuclear DisasterIt’s been 7 years since the Fukushima nuclear power plant disaster that was caused by a tsunami from a 9.0 magnitude earthquake in northern Japan in March 2011. Tragically, there are still children living daily with radioactive contamination in Fukushima. Radiation doesn't remain on blacktop and concrete surfaces. However, it stays active for a long time, and somehow recycles itself, in the natural environment within the soil, water, plants and other organic materials and living things.  Parks, rivers, fields, forests and beaches are highly susceptible.  These are the places that absorb and hold more radiation.  There are hot spots like these throughout Fukushima and some neighboring regions.  Sadly, such wonderful opportunities to play in the natural environments have been taken away from these children.  There are 7-year-old children in the Fukushima region that have spent their entire lives indoors, and have never played in nature due to the severity of the contamination.Here is an English movie by NPO Mother's Radiation Lab Fukushima.  We work closely with this organization. This footage accurately describes the kind of situation Fukushima mothers are faced with, and the high-level of anxiety and stress they have to deal with.https://tarachineiwaki.org/english Living in Radioactive ContaminationRadiation exists normally in small amounts in nature.  We are exposed to approximately 0.04μSv from the soil.  The Japanese government sets the safe standard for living with air radiation exposure at 0.23μSv per hour. In 2015, holding the radiation counter in our hands, we checked out a couple of parks in Koriyama, a city with a population of 330,000, about 60km away from the nuclear power plant.  The following movie shows the readings.  The numbers are ""μSv per hour"".  According to the government guideline, the maximum radiation one can live in is 0.23. You can see these parks, right in the middle of the residential area with schools, showing far more radiation than normal radiation levels, and in many spots, higher radiation than the government guideline. You might say this is not severe enough radiation to cause immediate death or illness.  It is said that 2000mSv of radiation in a short time would lead to a 5% mortality rate.  If you stay a whole year in a hot spot of 0.4μSv per hour at that corner of the park, you would be exposed to 3.5mSv per year.  That may seem to be a small amount compared to the dangerous 2000mSv level.  It’s true that it’s not of immediate danger, but accumulated radiation exposure over time can damage DNA and greatly risk one’s health.  Also you can't see, smell or feel radiation so it may go unnoticed until it’s too late.  If you live in this region radiation is an everyday threat.  You should avoid the exposure as much as possible, including internal radiation dosages through inhalation and ingestion of contaminated foods.You may wonder why people are still living in such an environment.  Some families have moved out of Fukushima.  The population has reduced by 8% since 2011.  Yet, the majority has stayed in Fukushima for various family and financial reasons.  Moreover, many have moved into Fukushima because the government recovery projects are creating new jobs.  There's an unspoken code for the majority of the residents, ""We have to live here anyway, so let's not talk about radiation.""In the meantime, conscientious mothers have to be safe by buying expensive foods from far away and avoiding cheaper local foods in fear of contamination.  Mothers need to keep telling their children, ""Don't touch that."" ""Don't play in that park."" ""You can't eat this."" in heartbreaking determination to avoid radiation exposure.  This means taking away opportunities for children to play, learn and nourish themselves in nature.Either due to this ongoing stress or from actual radioactive exposure, or maybe because these children haven't spent much time outside in nature, we are seeing Fukushima children become extremely vulnerable to illness. They become sick more easily and have developed allergic reactions to foods and insect bites. Many Children Have Developed Thyroid CancerThyroid Cancer is one of the first symptoms seen after high radiation exposure.  The Fukushima government conducts screening test every 2 years on all children who were 0 to 18 years of age at the time of the disaster.  Now, as of July 2018, 198 children have been discovered to have thyroid cancer. Before 2011, thyroid cancer was a rare disease for children in Japan, only 3 children out of 1,000,000.  The rate of thyroid cancer in the effected Fukushima area is now more than 500 children out of 1,000,000.  Also, in 2018, more and more children have contracted thyroid cancer in the neighboring prefectures.  The Japanese government denies this correlation with the nuclear disaster, while many doctors have sounded the alarm about the dire situation. In Chernobyl, serious health issues started turning up 5 years after their nuclear disaster.  We believe that this number in Fukushima will continue to grow. The Fukushima situation desperately requires closer attention for many years to come, and the children need more opportunities to cleanse the contamination and stress from their bodies. 3 weeks away from radioactivity releases contaminationThere are several studies to support that three weeks away from radioactivity exposure will detox the contamination from the body.  This is based on the results of the Whole Body Counter test, conducted in Chernobyl and in Fukushima.

<p>Hi!  I'm Nick.  I'm a recent Colorado State University grad in mechanical engineering and now live and work in the Boston area.  This indiegogo campaign is to help fund the tooling and production of an idea I've had kicking around for way too long... the Working Dog: The Dog Collar Bottle Opener.</p>
<center><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/Dzs5o.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></center>

<ul>
<li>Its loud.  If you are trying to sleep and the dog decides to move, that bottle opener is clanking against the tag just as loud as your alarm clock.</li>
<li>Opening a beer underneath the dog's head is a challenge.  She always wants to see what you are trying to do so it becomes less useful.</li>

<p>It's good to see you are interested in this campaign. Take this oppertunity to be part of something special.</p>
<p>The Plastic Factory is founded by Wendy Hartog – a young a creator with a green mind based in Amsterdam. Her love for nature and wildlife was one of the main reasons that motivated her to start her plastic recycling project. With the help of designer Dave Hakkens’ open source recycling machines venture- Precious Plastics, Wendy has started a small plastic recycling factory. The plan is to reduce plastic pollution at a local level by boosting plastic recycling. The Plastic Factory believes that preventing improper disposal of plastic waste is the first step in decreasing plastic pollution.</p>
<p><i>How it works?</i></p>
<p>Why is this venture so different you ask? Well for starters it makes plastic recycling more accessible to local communities. The other great thing about it is how it makes plastic recycling more rewarding and fun to ensure wider and enthusiastic participation from people! The community can donate their own plastic waste from home or waste that they find on the streets, in the park, on the beach etc. to the factory. In return they will get rewarded for their donation. The venture believes that by giving value to plastic waste, improper disposal will decrease and nature clean ups will be stimulated.</p>

<p>By doing this, we can lower the cost of energy, which, in turn, will lower the cost of most everything. <em>And</em> we can make fossil fuel power plants obsolete!</p>
<p>But we need your help to jump-start the process. We need to get the word out. We need that relatively small group of base customers to make it happen. We need <em>YOU</em> to help us make this happen!</p>
<p>Your contributions will be used to develop marketing materials and to make media purchases to get help spread the word and inform everyone about our Magical Gift Program.</p>
<p>Frankly though, the best advertising may just come from folks like you recommending this campaign to friends and family. The Indiegogo share tools make it simple!</p>
<p>If you haven't done so already, please be sure to watch our video and take a look at the great perks we're offering! Any contribution higher than the Magical Gift Program will also receive the Magical Gift Program automatically! Once you've made a contribution and recommended us to your friends, take the time to watch the detailed videos in the gallery.</p>
<p>Your contribution and information is protected by Indiegogo's secure servers. You can use your PayPal account or pay directly through PayPal without an account. And, we've chosen fixed funding so your contribution will be refunded if we don't meet our goal by the end of the campaign.</p>
<p>Note: The Magical Gift Program is only available in Maryland in the BGE, PEPCO, and DPL service areas, but we hope you'll support us even if you are outside of these areas. Some of the perks offered will require successful completion of not only this campaign but additional milestones as well.</p>

<br/><p></p>7 Things You Didn't Know About...Moringa

<p>The tall, thin moringa tree has been used
for centuries as a cure-all in its native Indian and North Africa. With the
renewed interest in holistic health and Ayurvedic medicine here in the west,
moringa is finally crossing the shores, and recently landed on my health-foodie
radar. </p>
<p>It’s a food that makes a strong first
impression, given the significant effects it can have on the human body. While
I was initially impressed by its nutrient profile (loaded with 90 nutrients
including all nine essential amino acids, making it one of the few plant-based
complete proteins), I was a little taken aback to discover its irreversible
effects on female fertility!</p>
<p>The potency of moringa serves as a great
reminder of how powerful our foods really are, and how important it is to do
your research before jumping on any new health food bandwagon. No doubt this
“miracle tree” can do great things for your body, but it’s essential to know
all of the other impacts it can have.</p>
<p>Luckily, I’ve given you a head start on
this one, with 7 facts I bet you didn’t know about moringa:</p>
<p><strong>1. Moringa is a world
traveler:</strong>While
moringa is native to southern Asia and northern Africa, you can now find it
growing all across the world. Commercial production of moringa has not only
spread through the rest of Africa and Asia, new farms have also sprung up in
Central America, South America, and even Hawaii. Because it doesn’t do well in
colder weather, there isn’t currently any large-scale American production of
moringa, though you may find farms growing it in southern states like Florida.
You could luck out and find it at a farmers market, or you could actually try
growing it yourself if you live in a warm climate, though the easiest route to
get it is to simply purchase it in powdered form from a health store.</p>
<p><strong>2. Moringa is a traditional
cure-all:</strong>Moringa
got its nickname, “miracle-tree,” from its varied characteristics and purposes
including its ability to treat a wide variety of ailments.<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17089328"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Science</a>has proven than it does indeed posses a
number of medicinal qualities, including being an antibacterial, antiviral,
antifungal, and antiinflammatory, which would explain why it grew to prominence
as a cure-all.  </p>
<p> Different parts of the tree,
including the leaves, flowers, and seeds, have each been used to treat
different ailments. Traditionally, its leaves were steeped in water to make tea
as a treatment for diarrhea, fevers, or various infections. The flowers can
also be used to make tea, and have been used to improve the quality and amount
of a mother’s breast milk. The leaves or crushed seeds were made into poultices
to treat wounds, as they have antibacterial and antifungal properties. Due to
its high nutritional content, moringa is also an important food source in some
parts of the world, particularly in India and Africa, where it is used in
feeding programs to fight malnutrition. The pods, which are called drumsticks,
are prepared similar to green beans, and the seeds are cooked like peas or
roasted like nuts. The leaves are sometimes cooked like spinach, or the
powdered leaves used as a condiment.</p>
<p><strong>3. Moringa is a natural
birth control:</strong>Moringa,
like many other Indian herbs, has been found to be an effective antifertility
treatment in both<em>in vitro</em>and animal studies. Therefore, women
in their childbearing years should avoid it completely. The plant chemicals in
moringa root, (which are more potent than the leaves) have been found to cause
a fertilized egg not to be able to attach to the lining of the uterine wall,
preventing pregnancy, as detailed in this<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1924986/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">study</a>. It
is unclear whether moringa leaves will have the same affect (simply because
there are no studies that disprove this), so it’s best to be precautionary.
Once pregnant, there is indeed<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3336641/pdf/ASL-7-172.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">evidence</a>that
ingesting the less potent moringa leaves will cause a miscarriage 100% of the
time. Traditional literature indicates that moringa was used as a<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1924986/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">permanent
form of birth control</a>, and even today, in certain parts of India, like West Bengal,
it is taken by prostitutes to avoid unwanted pregnancies. So ladies, step away
from the moringa until you’re sure you don’t want kids. Women who are not
looking to get pregnant and men shouldn’t be adversely affected from moringa
leaves.Moringa root should be avoided by all, as it not only prevents
pregnancy, but also contains toxins that can be lethal. </p>
<p><strong>4. Moringa empowers female
farmers:</strong>Despite
not being a particularly female-friendly herb (see point 3 above), moringa is
grown largely by women. The moringa tree is now widely cultivated across Africa
through women’s agricultural cooperatives. The ease of cultivation, hardiness,
and diverse uses of moringa have made it an excellent business opportunity for
the women in these cooperatives. Through their farm work, women are able to
generate income, fight back against poverty and malnutrition, and gain
bargaining power within their communities.</p>
<p><strong>5. Moringa can purify water:</strong>Thanks to its antimicrobial
and coagulant properties, moringa seeds are used to purify water cheaply and
effectively. They work to kill bacteria while also forcing any large particles
(like clay or silt) to be pushed to the bottom of the container so they can be
filtered out.  Because the seeds are abundant in many countries, and clean
water scarce, this helps solve a real dilemma, and contributes to its “miracle
tree” nickname.</p>
<p><strong>6. Moringa can survive in the
craziest places:</strong>Although
deep frosts can knock out a moringa tree, it can survive in many other harsh
conditions that would destroy most plants. Moringa can endure and thrive in dry
and drought prone areas, bad soil, and the banks of the salty sea.</p>
<p><strong>7. Moringa may help fight
cancer:</strong>The
entire moringa tree, including its seeds, leaves, bark, and roots contain
compounds, like niaziminin, which have been shown to <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1924986/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">inhibit
cancer cell growth</a>. Animal studies utilizing an aqueous extract specifically from
the root of the moringa plant have demonstrated its ability to inhibit the
growth of ovarian cancer.  While more research needs to be done, the sheer
number of nutrients and antioxidants in moringa make it a promising anti-cancer
candidate.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1462808364/themoringafarm-img1_8309322572111_a0nrd9.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/></div>","7 Things You Didn't Know About...Moringa

</div><p>It's no secret that the Amazon jungle is in danger and with a rise of 22% in deforestation since 2012; the threat on the environment has not stopped.  Pacaré is a little piece of this paradise in the state of Pará, Brazil.  Izabela has poured her savings, her sweat, and her life into this project of planting trees and restoring the habitat.  She's worked to protect the wildlife and bring balance back to Pacaré.  It's been an 8 year labor of love and my sisters courage and determination through every obstacle should inspire all of us.  </p><div>
</div><p>Her beloved Pacaré is beautiful today and a testament to understanding our responsibility for nature.  There's still much work to be done but her funds are depleted, that's where you can help us keep planting.  Her dream has always been to share this incredible adventure called the Amazon with everyone and we have a plan to continue the reforestation with revenue generated yearly.  We will construct an eco-lodge and show our guests the fragility of the Amazon and it's importance in our lives world wide. Of course it'll be an advenure our traveler's won´t forget but more importantly it will help raise an awareness to a problem that cannot be ignored.  </p><div>

</div></div>","This is a love story  
The love and respect I have for my big sister Izabela Pinto and our passion for the magnificent Amazon rainforest. This is her struggle to reforest an area devastated by illegal lumbering. 
It's no secret that the Amazon jungle is in danger and with a rise of 22% in deforestation since 2012; the threat on the environment has not stopped.  Pacaré is a little piece of this paradise in the state of Pará, Brazil.  Izabela has poured her savings, her sweat, and her life into this project of planting trees and restoring the habitat.  She's worked to protect the wildlife and bring balance back to Pacaré.  It's been an 8 year labor of love and my sisters courage and determination through every obstacle should inspire all of us.  
Her beloved Pacaré is beautiful today and a testament to understanding our responsibility for nature.  There's still much work to be done but her funds are depleted, that's where you can help us keep planting.  Her dream has always been to share this incredible adventure called the Amazon with everyone and we have a plan to continue the reforestation with revenue generated yearly.  We will construct an eco-lodge and show our guests the fragility of the Amazon and it's importance in our lives world wide. Of course it'll be an advenure our traveler's won´t forget but more importantly it will help raise an awareness to a problem that cannot be ignored.  
Your generous contribution is so valuable, but more valuable is your interest in understanding what we stand to lose if more land is destroyed in the Amazon.  Look what one person can do and let's see what all of us can accomplish together.

   
Now Let's continue planting some trees... 

We will need U$90,000, to build the lodge, a water treatment system, install solar energy and buy all the necessary equipament to start our work.
We calculated down to the penny and keep in mind that our aim is to be as natural as possible including materials that have no impact on the environment at all.

Construction (Engineering, architect, materials, and labor) $45000
Water Supply (Well enlargement, Treatment) $3820
Lodge (beds, furniture, hammocks, lockers, bedding, etc.) $11748
Solar Energy (Panels, transformer and labor)$20000
Appliances (freezers, washing machine, and A/C units) $6762
Personnel (Hospitality training, uniforms, and advertising)$2670  

These estimates are a bare minimum to build and open. We are so grateful for any assistance provide to us but If
we don´t reach our goal, any funding we receive will be used to buy the
material necessary to start the construction, while we try to secure more to
finish the lodge.  This is a big challenge to us, but a great opportunity too.In deep thanks for your support we want you to have such one a kind perks as a keep sake to remember your commitment in saving the rainforest. Our beloved region is known for having the best leather craftsman so with your caring gift of $25 your will receive a handmade personalized leather key chain to always remember your special place in this struggle. 


Yellow Ipê, once abundant in Pacaré´s region, today almost extint.



A t-shirt with our logo the symbol of Pacaré, the yellow Ipê flowering tree will be presented to those who donate $100 or more. This lovely tree was so plentiful in these forests but unfortunately it's high value created a demand and it's been reduced to almost extinction. Of course Izabela has made sure they are planted in Pacaré and hopefully the seeds will blossom throughout this area again. 
The lodge will adorn a plaque with the names of our generous patrons who donate $300 or more. Your compassionate gift will forever be remembered as we proudly display our heartfelt thanks for your belief in us and the Amazon.
We just need your help to take the first step in order to
continue the reserve.This kickoff will be our goal for the future of Pacaré Reserve. So please support us in this life project and preservation
of the earth´s most important natural biome, the Amazon Rainforest.
If in 8 years one person alone did so much, imagine this
place in 10 years with your help! Let's plant thousands more trees and keep our planet healthy!

Also, they will be greatly reducing waste at the same time! WasteQuest will work as a bridge connecting locals and surrounding communities. So that recycling will become much more accessible, efficient, and rewarding. Help me, help the Earth breathe and rejuvenate, Only WE can!</p>
<p><strong>How It Works</strong></p>
<p>People will be able to list their reusable and recyclable waste for others who are willing to pick it up. Either to reuse or recycle for income, we will be greatly reducing waste. The providers who are contributing and distributing the waste will be enrolled in a Monthly Refund Program. Also, they will be receiving 20% (rounded to nearest dollar) from each collected and distributed lot, paid by the gatherer. The gatherers gain through WasteQuest, is that they are going to have a much faster and more efficient work environment, compared to the work they are doing everyday for little income. Also, I strongly urge people who are unemployed, families with little income, or anyone that just needs some money to get by the day or month, to use this system to generate a solid income. Although, access to the mobile application and website it free to all, I must include a monthly subscription fee towards the gatherers. This is to generate enough income to reward providers for what they are doing, and to maintain and upgrade WasteQuest. Oh, let's not forget! A monthly GiveGreen Raffle will be held by WasteQuest, for all participating members in the quest to a healthier Planet! The raffle will have a select number of winners and we will be giving away cash and prizes. This includes gift cards, goods, getaways, and some fresh cash to spend! Everyone deserves a break and some time away from work. Here at WasteQuest we strongly believe in giving back to the people, so in turn the people will be motivated to clean up and reduce waste. I will be describing each part in its own category below. </p>
<p>I have created demo non-functional templates. This will show what I have in mind for the look and feel of WasteQuest. I am working on this entire project alone and do not have the skills and the tools needed to make it into a fully functioning and live application. That's why I've come to Indiegogo to help me make this come to life. The whole thing already exists, I just need the people to give me an opportunity and accept it.</p>
<p>Now the details....</p>

<p><strong>Provider</strong></p>
<p>The provider, gets unlimited access and listing on WasteQuest. The providers role is to collect and distribute the waste he/she usually throws away, which ends up in our dumps, and later our oceans. Now you will be getting paid for all the waste you were ignoring. All you need to do is collect and sacrifice some living space. Keep in mind that that space is retrievable, the damage being done by you and everyone else that is just disregarding the world, and sending everything to the dumps, is absolutely irreversible. What the provider is doing really, is that he/she is hitting two birds with one stone. While the provider collects and distributes, he/she is contributing to the Planet, and at the same time contributing to individuals and families who can really use the money they receive from reusing and recycling. </p>

<p><em>User Profile</em></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p>The providers will be able to build a user profile displaying their ranking  and stats. Viewing the users average monthly income through WasteQuest, and how much he/she is contributing to the community. Also, you will be able to contact the provider through messaging and ask for tips and advice on how they are managing their lots and materials. WasteQuest will be and always will remain an honest,supportive, and loving community. </p>
<p><strong>Gatherer</strong></p>
<p>The Gatherers role, is to reuse, recycle, and reduce the waste in his/her community for income. There are millions of people that walk,drive, and search for materials and things they can use, or recycle. With WasteQuest we are bringing these materials and items directly to your home, computer, and pocket. My goal is to connect the people to encourage a more efficient, faster, and rewarding experience when they decide to recycle. WasteQuest will be available to anyone with internet access, and I strongly encourage people who need a solid source of income for rent money, gas, bills. clothes, anything they wish, to check out WasteQuest and see what they can gain from it. Families in need, and the unemployed individuals will cherish this system for its availability and opportunities of income it provides. I would love to see millions of people using WasteQuest, and have the people accept it, so we can see drastic changes in our communities and our environment. The website and mobile application will be available for free to view listings and see materials  and items available. I will need to include a monthly subscription fee towards the Gatherer, and this is for maintaining the system, upgrades, rewarding providers, and holding raffles. Although, I must include a monthly fee, it will barely have any impact on families and individuals using the application. The positive increase in their daily work will be so great, that they will not hesitate to support my program with a monthly fee. Also, the 20% collectors fee must be paid by the Gatherer to the Provider, as a sign of appreciation. This is all calculated and will not affect the Gatherer in any way. The gas they spend driving around searching, or the energy spent walking will be cut down drastically, and the gain will be much greater. I have talked to many individuals who recycle and would love for a program like this to exist. I have mentioned the fees and they all agreed to pay if it would be available. So here it is!</p>

<li>Collects to Reuse, Recycle, and Reduce</li>

In every level you are given the opportunity to make more money and continue to grow! It is entirely up to you to choose how far you can push yourself and keep trying to beat last months achievements! The refund program is generating income for Providers that just discarded their waste and had a total loss of money. Now you are given the chance to accumulate over 30% of your spending back from your collected waste! All you need to do is collect, list, and distribute.</p>
<ul>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Common Recyclable Material Value Chart</strong></p>
<p>Once I am able to hire developers and build a team, I will be including a daily updated price list of the most common materials. Providers can use this directory for estimated pricing towards their Lot Value. Based on the estimated value, they will receive 20% from Gatherers, as a sign of appreciation. This gives the Provider total control over growth and planning of how to list his/her lots to get their top dollar back from garbage he/she used to throw away! Now you can use the money towards anything you like! How about some groceries to recycle the process? Just collect and build reasonable lot sizes to distribute to people willing to do the rest of the work! On average with the Collectors fee and the Refund Program, you will be receiving over 30% cash back monthly towards your spent money that generated the waste in the first place! Also, I would love to make available an instant material pricing Online help or Phone Support, for materials that might be missing from our directory. This is to get everyone the right pricing, and to continue to grow our material pricing database.</p>

<ul>
<li>Cash Prizes</li>

With a set amount of credit they will be able to decide and WasteQuest would love to make it happen.   </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Rules </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Provider's Lot must be about $8 in material value to be reasonable for listing.</li>
<li>Gatherer will be able to reserve 2 Lots every 15 minutes. Their account will be restricted from further bookings temporarily. This is to balance the distribution of materials to all people as equally as possible, and give everyone an opportunity. </li>
<li>Gatherer must show booking conformation to Provider before the transaction to validate that he/she is the correct person that reserved the Lot(s) .</li>
<li>The GiveGreen Raffle will occur every month before the month ends. So people receive their prizes before big bad rent and bills come around!. We will be giving away cash, gift cards, getaways, and the prizes just get better with more users. All people participating in WasteQuest will be entered in the monthly raffle. Give back and grow!  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fees</strong></p>
<p>I do not enjoy charging a fee for the service. I am forced to because of the system. The revenue will go mostly towards Providers Monthly Refunds and our GiveGreen Raffle. The rest of the money will be spent towards maintaining and updating the system, and of course paying the Apple and Android based markets. The fees are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Monthly subscription fee of $5.99 for Gatherers. You will be given free download and access to the application, but in order to access reservations and contact information, you must enroll in the monthly subscription. </li>
<li>A 20% Collectors Fee (rounded to nearest dollar)  will have to be paid upon pick-up to the Provider per Lot. Again, we must show our appreciation. There is much to be gained from WasteQuest, I do not believe these minimal fees will interfere with peoples financial status. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What do ""Lots"" and ""Reservations"" mean?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A ""Lot"" is referring to the material value and completed amount of the material you have collected as a Provider. Your 20% fee will be based on material value you have collected and these will be identified as ""Lots"".</li>
<li>""Reserving"" is referring to the process when after searching through the listings and when you are ready to pick it up, you must first ""Reserve"" it to yourself and your account. This way the ""Provider"" knows there is someone on the way to pick up their collected materials, and it is used to validate the ""Gatherers"" identity. Gatherers are allowed only 2 Lot reservations every 15 minutes to promote a balanced system. </li>
</ul>
<p><img alt=""Now You're Ready!"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/705/135/f7ffec62fbaa08ed37ac097c9893a925_large.jpg?1372370664"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<h3 class=""dotty""><span>Risks and challenges</span></h3>
<p>The challenges that come with this project is really the funding, and acceptance from the people. I have worked on this all on my own and if I was to be able to hire a professional developer for the mobile application and the website, and build a TEAM! I wouldn't have any problems. I have no prior experience in any of this, but I have managed to build a sample mobile application displaying what I have in mind. I am fully capable of leaping over every hurdle put in front of me. All my plans are written and solidified. I only need to produce the full application. Everything from beginning to end I have stored in my imagination. I know exactly what I want it to look like and I've tried to duplicate my imagination with the simple online tools I was provided. Didn't come out how I see it but its a template to show you that I know what I'm aiming for. I am not worried about putting my time into developing and launching the website and application I know it will be successful. I only need the funding and people to help achieve this. Thank you everyone for your support! It will never be forgotten and always will be appreciated. I will be forever in dept to all the people that supported a healthier, smarter, and more efficient generation. Thank you Indiegogo, for believing in my work and my goals. Without you I would not have the opportunity, nor the recognition to be able to pull this off.</p>

WasteQuest will be and always will remain an honest,supportive, and loving community. 
Gatherer
The Gatherers role, is to reuse, recycle, and reduce the waste in his/her community for income. There are millions of people that walk,drive, and search for materials and things they can use, or recycle. With WasteQuest we are bringing these materials and items directly to your home, computer, and pocket. My goal is to connect the people to encourage a more efficient, faster, and rewarding experience when they decide to recycle. WasteQuest will be available to anyone with internet access, and I strongly encourage people who need a solid source of income for rent money, gas, bills. clothes, anything they wish, to check out WasteQuest and see what they can gain from it. Families in need, and the unemployed individuals will cherish this system for its availability and opportunities of income it provides. I would love to see millions of people using WasteQuest, and have the people accept it, so we can see drastic changes in our communities and our environment. The website and mobile application will be available for free to view listings and see materials  and items available. I will need to include a monthly subscription fee towards the Gatherer, and this is for maintaining the system, upgrades, rewarding providers, and holding raffles. Although, I must include a monthly fee, it will barely have any impact on families and individuals using the application. The positive increase in their daily work will be so great, that they will not hesitate to support my program with a monthly fee.

A 20% Collectors Fee (rounded to nearest dollar)  will have to be paid upon pick-up to the Provider per Lot. Again, we must show our appreciation. There is much to be gained from WasteQuest, I do not believe these minimal fees will interfere with peoples financial status. 

What do ""Lots"" and ""Reservations"" mean?

A ""Lot"" is referring to the material value and completed amount of the material you have collected as a Provider. Your 20% fee will be based on material value you have collected and these will be identified as ""Lots"".
""Reserving"" is referring to the process when after searching through the listings and when you are ready to pick it up, you must first ""Reserve"" it to yourself and your account. This way the ""Provider"" knows there is someone on the way to pick up their collected materials, and it is used to validate the ""Gatherers"" identity. Gatherers are allowed only 2 Lot reservations every 15 minutes to promote a balanced system. 


Now You're Ready!
 
 
Risks and challenges
The challenges that come with this project is really the funding, and acceptance from the people. I have worked on this all on my own and if I was to be able to hire a professional developer for the mobile application and the website, and build a TEAM! I wouldn't have any problems. I have no prior experience in any of this, but I have managed to build a sample mobile application displaying what I have in mind. I am fully capable of leaping over every hurdle put in front of me. All my plans are written and solidified. I only need to produce the full application. Everything from beginning to end I have stored in my imagination. I know exactly what I want it to look like and I've tried to duplicate my imagination with the simple online tools I was provided. Didn't come out how I see it but its a template to show you that I know what I'm aiming for. I am not worried about putting my time into developing and launching the website and application I know it will be successful. I only need the funding and people to help achieve this. Thank you everyone for your support! It will never be forgotten and always will be appreciated. I will be forever in dept to all the people that supported a healthier, smarter, and more efficient generation. Thank you Indiegogo, for believing in my work and my goals. Without you I would not have the opportunity, nor the recognition to be able to pull this off.

<div>This campaign hopes to raise funds to be able to put on Fundemar's 3rd Annual Lion Fish tournament, to take place on the 13th of December. Every year, Fundemar gets together with local restaurants, dive shops, and fisherman in order to organize and put on a community lion fishing tournament. The tournaments are aimed at helping to stop the threat of the spread of the invasive lion fish species here in the Caribbean and prevent the loss of biodiversity that accompanies their presence in an area.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Fundemar's past annual tournaments have seen more than 900 lion fish eliminated from local waters by the more than 80 participants, made up of both local community members and visitors looking to get involved.

</div><div><h3>About the Tournament</h3></div><div> <p>The tournament will take place during the day of the 13th of December with participants competing to hunt as many lion fish in the area as possible. At the conclusion of the tournament, we'll have prizes in the categories, of most, biggest, and smallest fish and then all of the participants will get together with other members of the community to eat the catch and promote the fish's consumption. </p>
<p>All told, it costs about $2,000 dollars to put on the tournament in order to pay for the equipment, banners, prizes, t-shirts for participants, and food to cook with the lion fish.

In the past, we've received money as part of a USAID grant but as the term of that grant has expired, we need YOU to help support us and our mission to protect the region's biodiversity. </p>

</div> <div> <h3>Why Hunt Lion Fish?</h3>
<p>The lion fish is an invasive species that poses a grave threat to the marine ecosystems in the region. A voracious predator, it reproduces rapidly and faces no natural predators in the area to keep its population under control. Studies have shown that there is an 80% decrease in the biodiversity of coral reefs in which the fish is found.</p>
<p>The tournament is meant to massively fish the species in the area and promote its capture and consumption within the community in order to control the invasion and raise awareness of the threat that the fish poses to our coral reefs. </p>

<h3>Canada is now the only country within the UN that does not support the goal of fighting drought.</h3>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I am Praveen Chature a civil engineer and an urban infrastructure planner by profession, a dreamer and an adventurer by passion who wishes to play her part in creating a sustainable planet. I work on various urban/city planning projects in India. I want to be part of International Antarctic Expedition 2017 &amp; 2041 team, as I have been selected for it. </p>
<p><strong>What is IAE 2017?</strong></p>
<p>The International Antarctic Expedition 2016 is a leadership program hosted by Robert Swan and 2041 to bring together 60 individuals from across the world to experience the effects of climatic change in real time and brainstorm solutions to combat them. This mission will come a long way in building sustainable &amp; resilient communities across the world.</p>
<p><strong>What is 2041 &amp; why am I actually going?</strong></p>
<p><strong>2041</strong> is the year when the fate of Antarctica is decided by the Antarctica Treaty. The protocol on environmental protection to the Antarctic treaty was signed in Madrid on October, 1991 that designated Antarctica as a “natural reserve, devoted to peace and science” for 50 years. India is one of the consulting signatory member of this treaty. Our participation plays a bigger role in deciding the fate of Antarctica <strong>in 2041</strong>, hence we must know more about it for better future of Antarctica and in turn ours.</p>
<p>Climate change is real and it is human induced. Antarctica is not governed by humans, it has no government and no boundaries. It is owned by <strong>nobody but for greatest wildlife</strong>. They can’t fight for their rights on their own, so, we all need to come together to help save the last pristine continent.</p>
<p><strong>How can you help me achieve my goals?</strong></p>
<p>Robert Swan says “The greatest threat to our planet is the belief that someone else will save it.” This belief can be changed only through the collective efforts and by utilizing and sharing our knowledge, skills and experience to make a difference. And I want to do my bit in the vision of getting the world to adopt sustainable way of life and also to protect the Treaty of Antarctica.</p>
<p>My biggest challenge at present is to garner funds of $25000 USD through sponsorship, to get on the ship. By your contribution you will help me achieve my first goal to be part of IAE 2017, in support of 2041 mission.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The International Antarctic Expedition 2017 is a highly selective leadership program hosted by Robert Swan and an organization called 2041. Every year, only 60 people from across the world make it to the ship to Antarctica, to experience climatic change real-time and brainstorm solutions to build sustainable and resilient communities to thereby preserve the pristine continent. While getting to be one of the chosen few was a challenge in itself, the tough weather conditions in the southernmost part of the world will definitely be another uphill task! My ultimate goal- to create a leadership module for young learners- is a personal challenge I have undertaken. I am confident in my dream and its demands, as long as I get to go there.

<p>This <strong>Disaster &amp; Solid Waste Remediation Technician Training &amp; Certification Program</strong> will create an army of skilled technicians capable of solving a major problem in the World, <strong>solid waste pollution</strong>. With the many different types of disasters creating massive property destruction or the general day to day dumping of solid waste into our environment this training program has the potential of eliminating this major problem.</p>
<p><strong>California Leading Edge, Inc</strong> (<strong>CLEI’s) </strong>program will train each student to inspect, evaluate, segregate and recycle a majority of the solid waste we now generate and dump into the environment. These newly trained technicians will then be able to direct different waste streams to a specific recycler or to a destination where it can be utilized to generate clean electricity.  <strong>CLEI’s </strong>Training Program will begin a massive recycling boom that can go a long way in cleaning up the environment and ridding the country of most solid waste pollution.  Most importantly, almost every corner of our country has been negatively affected by this problem and this program will attack this problem head on.</p>
<p><strong>Why Support This Project?</strong></p>
<p>One of the major environmental problems confronting our country and almost every other country in the World is the proper disposal of solid waste. Segregating and recycling waste materials is going to be one of the most important challenges of the 21st century. This problem is growing in scope and size every day. It is a problem for us today and will be a problem in the future unless something is done to change the way we handle the massive amounts of different wastes generated by us. </p>

<p>Currently, there are virtually no resources, personnel, nor the funds to remediate this blight on our lands.  Local, State and Federal Governments simply do not have the financial resources nor personnel to effective address this massive goal.</p>
<p>A way must be found to make the commercial sector begin remediating the vast number of illegal dump sites and landfills while making the cleaning up of our environment feasible and profitable. Look anywhere, our beaches, our roads, rural landscape and underserved urban communities for trash and solid waste materials and you will see illegal dump sites. Our neighborhoods, roadsides and rural areas are being turned into massive illegal waste dumps as well.</p>
<p>The United States currently produces over <strong>11 billion tons </strong>of solid waste per year and only about <strong>195 million tons</strong> of it is put into legal landfills.  As you can see there is quite a difference in the amount generated per year and the amount that legally goes into our landfills or is currently being burned to make electricity or other useful materials.</p>

<p>Most of our landfills are full and opening new landfills require greater transportation costs, lack of public acceptance and the pollution that they generate are fouling the environment.</p>
<p>This tells us that millions of tons of illegal solid waste are dumped into our communities and rural areas every year. It is very difficult to know the exact amount of waste being dumped because most of the dumping amounts and locations are unknown.  Sometimes government does remediate a very small portion of this waste, but in most cases it just sits in place polluting every corner of our country.</p>
<p><strong>It is conservatively estimated that almost 95% of all waste generated by us can be recycled to make new products. By burning and utilizing amazing new technologies, electrical producers can generate much needed clean and environmentally safe electric power.  </strong></p>
<p>The solution to this problem will be to develop small new companies and properly train individuals to remediate disaster damage, illegal dumpsites and work within companies to segregate and recycle their waste.</p>
<p>A new business model must be developed to provide not only the number of qualified people needed to handle the volume but also provide the expertise to segregate the vast number and different types of waste that is disposed of into the environment.  </p>

<p><strong>Our Solution To The Problem</strong></p>
<p>To accomplish these goals, a new and technical set of job skills are needed.  These skills would require an individual to have a detailed knowledge of different types of waste, how to separate and handle them safely. These new entry level job skills would require specific knowledge and specialized training.</p>
<p>These important job skills would also allow these newly trained technicians to properly identify, segregate, recycle and dispose of all different types of solid waste. This training would be imperative in eliminating a majority of legal waste now put into landfills and the illegally disposed of solid waste being dumped all over the land and in our waters. </p>
<p>We have become a society of extreme consumers where almost everything we buy becomes unusable in a relatively short period of time. This has set in motion many of the problems that are dramatically polluting our environment.</p>
<p>When you set your trash out, it’s taken to a permitted landfill where it sits for eternity. In many cases, depending upon its composition, it breaks down and tragically pollutes the surrounding land and underground water supply.</p>
<p><strong>CLEI’s</strong> first training module will develop the comprehensive training needed to provide entry level knowledge and skills to safely, efficiently and effectively remediate any type of solid waste legally or illegally that has been put into the environment.</p>

This Disaster & Solid Waste Remediation Technician Training & Certification Program will create an army of skilled technicians capable of solving a major problem in the World, solid waste pollution. With the many different types of disasters creating massive property destruction or the general day to day dumping of solid waste into our environment this training program has the potential of eliminating this major problem.
California Leading Edge, Inc (CLEI’s) program will train each student to inspect, evaluate, segregate and recycle a majority of the solid waste we now generate and dump into the environment. These newly trained technicians will then be able to direct different waste streams to a specific recycler or to a destination where it can be utilized to generate clean electricity.  CLEI’s Training Program will begin a massive recycling boom that can go a long way in cleaning up the environment and ridding the country of most solid waste pollution.  Most importantly, almost every corner of our country has been negatively affected by this problem and this program will attack this problem head on.
Why Support This Project?
One of the major environmental problems confronting our country and almost every other country in the World is the proper disposal of solid waste. Segregating and recycling waste materials is going to be one of the most important challenges of the 21st century. This problem is growing in scope and size every day. It is a problem for us today and will be a problem in the future unless something is done to change the way we handle the massive amounts of different wastes generated by us. 
  

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Currently, there are virtually no resources, personnel, nor the funds to remediate this blight on our lands.  Local, State and Federal Governments simply do not have the financial resources nor personnel to effective address this massive goal.
A way must be found to make the commercial sector begin remediating the vast number of illegal dump sites and landfills while making the cleaning up of our environment feasible and profitable. Look anywhere, our beaches, our roads, rural landscape and underserved urban communities for trash and solid waste materials and you will see illegal dump sites. Our neighborhoods, roadsides and rural areas are being turned into massive illegal waste dumps as well.
The United States currently produces over 11 billion tons of solid waste per year and only about 195 million tons of it is put into legal landfills.  As you can see there is quite a difference in the amount generated per year and the amount that legally goes into our landfills or is currently being burned to make electricity or other useful materials.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Most of our landfills are full and opening new landfills require greater transportation costs, lack of public acceptance and the pollution that they generate are fouling the environment.
This tells us that millions of tons of illegal solid waste are dumped into our communities and rural areas every year. It is very difficult to know the exact amount of waste being dumped because most of the dumping amounts and locations are unknown.  Sometimes government does remediate a very small portion of this waste, but in most cases it just sits in place polluting every corner of our country.
It is conservatively estimated that almost 95% of all waste generated by us can be recycled to make new products. By burning and utilizing amazing new technologies, electrical producers can generate much needed clean and environmentally safe electric power.  
The solution to this problem will be to develop small new companies and properly train individuals to remediate disaster damage, illegal dumpsites and work within companies to segregate and recycle their waste.
A new business model must be developed to provide not only the number of qualified people needed to handle the volume but also provide the expertise to segregate the vast number and different types of waste that is disposed of into the environment.

Our Solution To The Problem
To accomplish these goals, a new and technical set of job skills are needed.  These skills would require an individual to have a detailed knowledge of different types of waste, how to separate and handle them safely. These new entry level job skills would require specific knowledge and specialized training.
These important job skills would also allow these newly trained technicians to properly identify, segregate, recycle and dispose of all different types of solid waste. This training would be imperative in eliminating a majority of legal waste now put into landfills and the illegally disposed of solid waste being dumped all over the land and in our waters. 
We have become a society of extreme consumers where almost everything we buy becomes unusable in a relatively short period of time. This has set in motion many of the problems that are dramatically polluting our environment.
When you set your trash out, it’s taken to a permitted landfill where it sits for eternity. In many cases, depending upon its composition, it breaks down and tragically pollutes the surrounding land and underground water supply.
CLEI’s first training module will develop the comprehensive training needed to provide entry level knowledge and skills to safely, efficiently and effectively remediate any type of solid waste legally or illegally that has been put into the environment.
  

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
This program can and will dramatically stimulate a very large area of our economy when they are educated with CLEI’s “Disaster & Solid Waste Remediation Technician Training & Certifiation Program”.  The recycling of most solid waste is the goal, however in the process, this program will also clean up our environment and create tens of thousands of new green jobs and hundreds of small businesses nationwide.
Program Training Modules (To Include):
These modules will teach trainees how to handle specific types of remediation situations in many different types of situations and places. 

Solid Waste Remediation Technician Certification Training Program (Core Training Module – Required To Take Any Additional Program Modules)
Solid Waste Remediation Business Development Certification Training Program(Business Development Module)
Federal Lands Remediation Certification Training Program
Local & State Government Property Remediation Certification Training Program
Private Property Remediation Certification Training Program
Commercial Property Remediation Certification Training Program
Construction Site Remediation Certification Training Program
Hazardous Materials Handler Certification Training Program (Safety Module)
Hazardous Waste Handler Certification Training Program (Safety Module)
Built into each of these training modules will also be detailed information about the different types of disasters, how to remediate them and what to do with the various types of debris.   This program will rely heavily on recycling as much of this debris as possible. 
Training modules will be provided in computer classrooms around the country, at home or work over the internet.  The multimedia interactive format demands that each student masters each lesson or the program makes them repeat it until they understand each lesson presentation.
We need your help!  
For this project to be implemented properly, significant funding will be required.  We have prepared and submitted a detailed grant proposal to the Department of Labor with the intention of having them fund the full development of all of the additional modules defined above. 
However, they want to see evidence that we have community and business support for this project. Your support can deliver the proof along with the development of the first downloadable PDF version of the student training manual that will be created from the funds provided by our supporters.
CLEI’s training program will be an important step in cleaning up our environment and limiting the amount of waste put into landfills.  Not only will this program help to accomplish these goals, but it will grow recycling programs all over the country providing dramatic new revenue sources.  It will permit us to train thousands of people, nationwide, that will turn trash into raw materials that can be used over and over again.

Where Will Your Money Go?
We will be creating a downloadable PDF detailed preview/introduction Student Workbook to include the following curriculum;

What Is Solid Waste?
Types Of Solid Waste
Where To Find This Waste
How To Cleanup This Waste
What Is Recycling?
Types Of Recycling
Basic Material Handling
Safety Considerations
Disaster Recovery & Remediation
 
Your support will help us justify the additional major funding for development of the additional training modules. These training modules will allow the user to learn at his/her own pace and when assistance is needed, detailed assist will be available with our online support team. 
The multimedia aspect will provide dramatic visual presentations and the interactive capabilities will provide a powerful delivery system. Any additional funds from Indiegogo Supporters over and above our goal will be used to begin development of the computer based multimedia interactive training modules.
Risks & Challenges
This project while massive in scope is already far along in its development;

The first downloadable student preview/introduction manual is already near completion.
The curriculum outlines are currently in development for each of the multimedia interactive training modules.
The multimedia interactive scripts for each of the training modules are also under development. 
We are sending project announcements to over 1,200 environmental foundations and advocacy groups with total memberships in the millions.
The challenges may be great but the rewards of developing this program will dramatically invigorate the cleaning up of our environment and the recycling of the waste being put into it.
We are convinced that the support we will generate for this project will allow us to obtain the major grant that we have already submitted to the Department of Labor proving to them that this training program will train thousands of technicians and in time create hundreds of small businesses.

<h3>I am opening a cut flower farm to sell and distribute flower bouquets. My goal is to make life a little more beautiful one bouquet at a time. </h3>
<p>I have wanted to open a farm since working for Unity Gardens as an intern in 2015. I loved working outside in the dirt and seeing the magic of what grows. I spent a lot of time in college studying ecology, botany, and other earth sciences. My passion for science is rooted in the dirt. I have a Bachelors of Science in Biology, with applied minors in Chemistry and Business Administration.  I am well equipped to start this farm. I was inspired to start the farm now because of a very opinionated and thoughtful individual in my life and he said ""if not now, then when?"". So this is my when! Thank you for participating. </p>
</div><div><ul>
<li>I need about $10,000 and I could take out a loan for it, but I would rather include the community in the development of this project and spread more love through growing and cultivating flowers and friendship in a positive way. </li>
<li>Cut flower microfarms are on the rise and are taking over the floral industry slowly but surely to bring more money into local farming communities and economies.</li>
</ul></div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Developing this farm is not just going to be fun, but it can have some positive impact as well:</p>
<ul>
<li>Help native animals and insects to have a safe haven to exist that is safe and well-maintained. </li>
<li>Support a female entrepreneur</li>
<li>Develop another form of artistry in our community through floral arrangement and cultivation</li>
<li>Add jobs to the local economy at the farm, in floral arrangement.</li>
<li>Bring joy to people and events</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Naturally, there are risks associated with starting a farm, especially with the devastating effects humans have had on the environment over the last century. </p>
