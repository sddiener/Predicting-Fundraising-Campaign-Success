</div><p> <span></span></p><h3>Who We Are</h3>RealLivePeople
 is a Philadelphia-based dance company that explores human experiences 
through firsthand stories and unspoken gestures; we focus on the spaces 
between, the quick look away and the light tap on the shoulder. Our work
 strives to balance inventive, athletic movement with poignant and 
provocative interactions that resonate with an audience. We tackle our 
subject matter from multiple perspectives, collaborating with composers,
 artists and filmmakers and even incorporating our audience’s opinions 
and stories into the work in real time. For us the work is about being 
human onstage—part performance, part real-life. <p></p>
<h3><span>Would I lie to you?<br/></span></h3>
<p><span></span></p><p><em></em></p><p><em>We recently spent a week in the woods of northern New Jersey in a residency made possible by White Pines Productions, and what we re-discovered there is simple. We really like what we do. A valuable affirmation, yes? However, what was so incredible about that week was the time and space it afforded us to really dig into this new project as an ensemble.</em></p><p>
<em>'Would
I lie to you?'</em>,
like previous work by RealLivePeople, is an exploration of our sense
of identity and common humanity. But this time it’s all about
lying: who we lie to, when we lie most often and how we feel about
it.</p>
<p>
Rather
than asking these personal questions to strangers we’ve stayed a
bit closer to home: each of the dancers tracked his or her lies and
reported them back to the group. From there I, Gina, conducted an
interview with each dancer about his or her lying habits – the text
from these interviews forms a large portion of the sound score for
the piece.</p>
<p>
What
we’ve learned so far is this: pretty much everyone lies all the
time but we feel really differently about it. Some dancers believe
that their lives would be better if they never lied while others
believe that lying is a necessary part of many of their relationships
and interactions – it keeps thing cordial. There are also
discussions about cheating, familial patterning, text/email deceit,
chronic exaggeration and long term self-delusion. It’s kind of
juicy.</p>
<p>
We
dance to the sound of ourselves talking about what liars we are. We
follow verbal improvisation structures that often reveal surprising
truths about a dancer in real time. We ask audience members to
anonymously submit a lie they've told, and we make a dance about it.
Oh, and there’s a lot of exciting, ambitious and full-bodied
dancing.</p><p><span></span></p>
<h2><span><h3>Your Help</h3></span></h2>
<p><span></span></p><p>
We
are a small, young, talented dance company. We have the drive, the
organizational abilities and the artistic expertise to make this show
a success. We are presenting 'Would I lie to you?' as part of the
Philadelphia Fringe Festival, and as with any self-presented show, we
must cover every cost ourselves. </p><p>This year is our first receiving
funding from both the Philadelphia Cultural Fund and the Samuel S.
Fels Fund, and we are more than grateful for their confidence in this
project. The entire budget is approximately $14,000. We have already
raised over 35% of the money through the generous support of the
above organizations, and, to be safe, we are only budgeting on 25% of
our income coming from ticket sales. Will you help us cover the rest?
Your support will go to important, real things:</p>

chose IndieGoGo because it ensures that your donations are tax-deductible through our fiscal sponsor, Fractured Atlas. We also tried
to create perks that both acknowledge you and invite you to share in
our world. But we know that you'll most likely help because you
believe in this project so we want to assure you, it's worth
believing in.</p><p><span> </span></p>
<h3><span>The Impact</span></h3><p><span></span></p><p>
As
a small company we often face challenges with funding and scheduling
but what we do not lack is talent, creativity and an eye for making
dance exciting to watch. 'Would I lie to you?' is by far our most
ambitious and exciting project to date. The act of giving towards
this project tells us, “Yes, I affirm that this sounds
interesting, and yes, I believe is it worthwhile doing, and yes, I
think that you as artists should make more work like this.” So,
thank you for that vote of confidence, confidence in what we're doing
now and where we could go in the future. Really. We're not lying
about that part. We are truly grateful.</p> <p></p>

</h3><p>
 The all-female cast of <b><i>Fefu &amp; Her Friends</i></b> takes the audience on a 
journey through the lives of 8 women living in 1935 New England. Set 
within the time frame of 24 hours, we explore different areas of not 
only their personal lives and intimate struggles,  but of the physical 
environments within varying playing spaces throughout the Theatre. 
Feminist playwright, Maria Irene Fornes, explores gender and societal 
roles - generating a conversation just as relevant today as it was 
during its release in 1977. <b><i>Fefu &amp; Her Friends</i></b> is a uniquely 
interactive and immersive theatrical experience - <span>truly not to be missed!<br/> <b><i><br/>
 ""A wonderful, important play.""</i></b> - Susan Sontag.<b><i>""An extraordinary play of 
uncommon insight and wit.""</i></b> - Los Angles Herald Examiner. <i><b>""One of the

LEARN MORE ABOUT FEFU & HER FRIENDS:

 The all-female cast of Fefu & Her Friends takes the audience on a 
journey through the lives of 8 women living in 1935 New England. Set 
within the time frame of 24 hours, we explore different areas of not 
only their personal lives and intimate struggles,  but of the physical 
environments within varying playing spaces throughout the Theatre. 
Feminist playwright, Maria Irene Fornes, explores gender and societal 
roles - generating a conversation just as relevant today as it was 
during its release in 1977. Fefu & Her Friends is a uniquely 
interactive and immersive theatrical experience - truly not to be missed! 
 ""A wonderful, important play."" - Susan Sontag.""An extraordinary play of 
uncommon insight and wit."" - Los Angles Herald Examiner. ""One of the 
most powerful plays written about the mysteries and shared 
hallucinations of the female experience."" - L.A.

Our History
We started slowly - a series of play readings on a Las Vegas patio.  
Soon, it was standing room only as our growing company of theatre professionals envisioned making a major contribution to a growing local scene. We have taken the monthly readings public which has attracted new talent and an ever-growing audience.  
The readings continually draw a standing room only crowd… so it's time to throw our first fully-realized Public Fit:  
Dawn King's Foxfinder 
November 13-23 
at the Art Square Theatre in downtown Las Vegas.
Our Culture
Las Vegas draws the most talented people on the planet to perform in its neon-fueled strip spectaculars. Once they land here they immediately yearn for the cultural community they left behind.  
We are going to harness those creative super-novas by creating an innovative, dynamic, truly professional theatre company with a downtown vibe, offering true Las Vegas cultureto an audience that's been forged in the fires of national ridicule. (If you live in Las Vegas, you know what we're talking about)
Right now, our city is known as a punchline, an advertising slogan. You know as well as we do how much more there is to our small desert town. We are a company of performers who grew up RIGHT HERE IN LAS VEGAS. We came of age beneath 60 foot signs of half naked showgirls bearing the ironic declaration ""Bring the whole family!!""
Ours is an aesthetic very different from anywhere else in the world because we are immune to sexual suggestion, deaf to the ring ring ring of the beckoning poker machines. The strip shows are not our art, the strip shows are fodder for our anthems.
Where we’re going…
Steppenwolf began in a church basement; A Public Fit was born on a hot Las Vegas patio.
But we need your help in order to pay our performers a reasonable wage.  Too often in community theatre, actor ""salaries"" end up as little more than a ""per diem,"" gas money in order to offer some sort of compensation for long hours and creative exhaustion.  APF respects artists too much to ask them to work for free.

Not to mention enchanted. The place, itself, sings!  And to the heavens!  The Beachcomber Boys is a love-letter to it...and to all its sweet, salty and strange characters, past and present. ~IT TAKES A FISHING VILLAGE!~WHY WE NEED YOU!The $20,000 we hope to raise will be one-third of the actual cost of this Production.*We will be teaming up with additional Producing Partners to be announced soon!YOUR DONATION WILL PAY FOR:Musical composition, arrangements and scoreAudition materials/and audition space rentalRehearsal space rentalTravel and housing expenses for creative team, a dozen actors, composer and musicians, for Workshop ReadingPublicity for Workshop ReadingRental of theatrical venue for Workshop Reading, with MusicAnd this is just the Development phase!~PRODUCTION:With good luck and careful planning, we will also be able to put some of your generous donations into Production, set to premiere in Provincetown!SetsLightsCostumesProjectionsOrchestraPublicityProgramsEquity contractsPay for non-union actorsPay for running crewHousing/Travel expenses for ProductionBells & Whistles & Banners!~PHEW!~Yes!  This is ambitious!  But where else but Provincetown would the sky be the limit?Please help us realize this enormous vision...and Thank You!

The Baz’Arts Theatre in France has just finished translating World of Sinatras and The Unraveling for production over there.  And I’ve just completed a TV pilot, King Dollar.

<h3>The Story of the Show</h3>
<p>In 2015, I (show creator Brent Black) was watching a space-themed dance show when I suddenly thought of the character ""Chekov"" in his spacesuit from the Star Trek movie <i>The Wrath of Khan</i>. This sparked an idea: Could <i>Khan</i> work as a parody musical? Now, over four years later, the answer seems to be a resounding <u>YES!</u> Along the way, Dany Roth of <i>Syfy Wire</i> helped me to shape a framing device that included Picard and Data from<i> </i><i>Star Trek: The Next Generation</i>.  We've now held three developmental showings to get it in shape for an off-Broadway production in New York City, and the upcoming Philadelphia Fringe Festival reading is the final step!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What Will This Pay For?</h3>
<ul>
<li>We're paying actors $250 apiece and would love to pay them more!</li>
<li>We'll be renting rehearsal space and performance space by the hour; it adds up!</li>
<li>Gotta pay for marketing, audio equipment, and music stands!</li>
<li>If we don't reach our goal, at least you've made a dent in our debt!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What's the point?</h3>
<p>I'm a Trekkie and a musical theatre fan. The prospect of making people like myself laugh, celebrating their fandom, and presenting them with a tuneful score is a years-long dream, and you can help make it come true.</p>

<p>Rhododendron Descent is an evening-length dance performance inspired by Mt. Everest climbing expeditions. It is the fourth and final dance of a series. It is the piece that was visualized from the beginning but only now do we have the opportunity to realize the true vision of this work. The three related works performed so far, have gained serious momentum with audiences, technical needs and budget demands. The dancers, riggers, musicians, designers, technicians, and venue are all in place with funds to get us going. The only missing piece is you. It is your support that will get us to opening night!</p>

<p><strong><em>You are over 28,000 ft. above sea level and there is no turning back. Though breathless and even doubtful, with only a few hundred feet left to go, you must traverse impossible terrain that delivers you to the summit of the highest peak in the world. This is where you connect with the expansiveness of the universe; a place where the curvature of the earth reveals itself in the horizon.  It took over 30 years to carve a route to the top of Everest. Since then thousands have tried, countless failed and hundreds have died.</em></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>This project is a response to stories of climbers facing hurricane-force winds and diminishing oxygen supply, traversing impossible terrain, and the moments of recovery that fuel determination. Intrigued by man’s will to face one of the upmost physical human endeavors, Jennifer visualized a creative interpretation, a response to her findings through dance.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What we’ve received so far…</strong></p>
<p>This project has been recognized by the City of Austin and The Creative Fund, both have awarded us grants that propel this work into its fruition. We have earned a rent subsidy that allows us to perform in the ideal venue, the beautiful St. Elmo Soundstage.  It is the perfect venue, meeting all technical specifications and truly supports the project’s innovative ideas for set design, effects, climber’s rigging and sound.

<p><em>Rhododendron Descent </em>contributes to the diversity of arts by offering an entirely new level of audience experience. Mt.

<p>The Square Foot Theatre Company Mission Statement:</p>
<p>To establish and maintain a venue for the visual and performing arts through support and education while providing opportunities to experience the arts through observation, hands on participation and education.</p>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>With 26 shows under our belts in 5 short years - 850 actors have graced our stages, over 25,000 audience members have witnessed the magical talent.  Now, it's your turn!</p>
<p><strong>What We Need </strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Moving our theatre to a warehouse space has become quite the obstacle.  With town codes and regulations constantly changing - we've been blindsided by circumstances beyond our control.  Please help us lift this burden!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Stand up and be counted!  We are not asking for much - only one dollar to be exact.  A donation of $1 and the promise that you will share our video with your friends and family along the way.  Allow us the opportunity to give the community a venue to have our talents shine.  Our $20,000 goal is a dream in the making. Help us get the word out and keep the arts alive in the community!  Believe me, it matters! </p>

<p class=""normal"">Greetings.  My name is Daniel Patrick Fay.  I am a NYC based puppeteer, designer and performer.  Recently my creative partner, Andrew Livingston (a composer) and I were accepted to the Puppet Lab at St. Ann’s Warehouse for a piece that has been in our notebooks for some time.  The piece explored the strange events that centered around a small West Virginian town called Point Pleasant.  On November 15, 1966, two young couples from Point Pleasant, West Virginia encountered; what they described as “a large winged man with glowing red eyes.”  This would be the first of many sightings of the creature that would be dubbed the “Mothman” by local papers, and ushered in a year of terror for the small town.</p>
<p class=""normal"">A local reporter named Mary Hire prints the eye-witness accounts of the Mothman.  As the sightings intensify, and strange reports grow even stranger still, all activity comes to a screeching halt, when on a cold December evening the town suffered a great tragedy.  For seemingly no reason at all, The Silver Bridge, the main artery connecting two towns separated by the Ohio River suddenly, and unexpectedly collapsed sending dozens of people into the icy depths of the river, which would be, the climatic, and terrible end to the supernatural events that haunted the town for just over a year.    </p>
<p class=""normal"">The development of the piece is currently underway.  In the past few months we’ve taken the piece from sketches and notes into a completed script, some partially developed scenes, and some puppets.  The piece features bunraku puppetry, some miniature live feed on a scale model of  Point Pleasant, and some shadow puppetry sequences.   Aesthetically, the piece is black and white tale that employs a sketchy, grainy quality and lends itself nicely to the eerie tale being told.   It is a sensory experience, using light, sound, &amp; puppetry to recreate some of the accounts that came from the citizens of Point Pleasant.  The piece is meant to convey the overall sentiment of this time, in this specific place: the fear, sadness, and the lack of comprehension.  It is not our intention to debate the validity of the sightings, and encounters, but rather depict through music, movement, and puppetry the experiences of the people who, encountered, and lived through this phenomena. </p>
<p class=""normal"">We are endeavoring to raise funds to pay our talent who have helped us develop the piece thuas far.  Your contributions can support the realization of this piece and place some money in the hands of the incredible group of puppeteers and musicians that have dedicated their time and talent during the developmental process.  All of the proceeds from the fundaraiaser awill go into the handas of the people who have dedicated the better part of 6 months to this project.  Thank you for your support.  </p>

<p><strong>My name is Andrea Scott and I'm a playwright in Toronto Canada. I've been writing plays for about 3 years but <em>Eating Pomegranates Naked</em>  has me the most excited. </strong><strong>With support from the Ontario Arts Council, Obsidian Theatre, The Grand Theatre, Alumnae Theatre, and bcurrent, I’m happy to announce that Eating Pomegranates Naked will finally take to the stage!</strong></p>
<p><strong>In order to create the show as I envision  I need</strong><strong> a little bit of your time and money before the show launches on August 8.</strong></p>
<p><strong>In a festival setting it is common practice to split the box office profits. However, even  sell-out shows don't guarantee a living wage. I want to give the creative team: actors, director, stage manager and designers proper compensation for taking this play to the next level. </strong> </p>
<h2><strong>RELATIONSHIPS ARE HARD<br/></strong></h2>
<p><strong>This play is for women, men, and couples alike, who are facing conception challenges and endured polite faces when asked over and over again “When are you going to have a baby?”</strong></p>
<p><strong style=""font-size: 10px;""><strong>20% of all pregnancies end in miscarriage but people still talk about it in hushed tones.  <br/></strong><strong>11-15% of all couples experience infertility but nobody talks about it.</strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Let's open the conversation.</strong></p>
<p><strong>This play is for women, men, and couples alike, who are facing conception challenges and endured polite faces when asked over and over again “When are you going to have a baby?”</strong></p>
<p><strong>While interviewing directors for a public reading last year 3 women confessed that they had endured a miscarriage. They whispered it while furtively making sure nobody could hear them.</strong></p>
<p><strong>You know these people, they are your friends, your family and maybe, you are these people. You are giving to Eating Pomegranates Naked to spread the word that baring yourself emotionally can be the most honest and helpful thing you can do for yourself and others.</strong></p>
<p><strong style=""font-size: 1.5em;"">THAT'S A LOT OF CASH</strong></p>
<p><strong>I live in a tiny apartment with silverfish as pets so I completely understand if $20 is too much to donate; canned beans are my friends too! If all you can do is tell people about <em>Eating Pomegranates Naked</em> because you want to help out a new playwright then you've done more than enough. Use those social media wizards like Facebook and Twitter and maybe it will help this play. It's all good.</strong></p></div>","EATING POMEGRANATES NAKED GETS ITS WORLD PREMIER ON AUGUST 8 2013.

The funding we receive here will help us produce a high quality musical that the whole community can enjoy.


The Impact

Our campaign is designed to help produce an amazing musical for Mira Mesa and beyond. Our mission is to foster, promote, and increase public knowledge and appreciation for the arts in San Diego county through theatre. We hope to expand our outreach to the community by being able to publicize our production in local news papers and radio. With the money we will be able to drastically expand our production by hiring musicians so that we can have a live orchestra. The funding from this project also helps us meet our budget goals and bolster the ability of both Pacific Coast Theatre Company and the Mira Mesa High Drama Department to bring quality theatre to our community.

What We Need & What You Get


The money you help us raise will be spent on the production of this musical production. We need the help of generous donors like yourselves to help spread the love of art, and reengage a new generation, and let them see the beauty of live theatre. Producing a show like this is not cheap. Costs include:

Rights and Royalties: $2,300.00Marketing: $900.00Technical Equipment: $200.00 (including sets)Lightning Equipment: $100.00More importantly, though, there are many things our current budget cannot provide. We would love to add live musicians as well as stipends to members of the cast and crew to this list!
If we are unable to meet our funding goal the production will still continue, we may have to cut back on certain aspects of the production. Your contribution will make a world of difference to the members of the community, the members of the cast and crew, and the staff at Pacific Coast Theatre Company.

 

Other Ways You Can Help

After you have contributed to our performance be sure to tell your friends and family about our cause! Remember you can use the share tools to help spread the word! Word of mouth is our most powerful tool so please be sure and help out.

And don't forget that the best way you can show our cast and crew that you care is not just donating, but also enjoying the show this September 23rd and 24th.",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Help <strong>Pipe Dreams Studio Theatre</strong>, a student-run theatre company in central Illinois, raise $7,000 to purchase a new dimmer rack for our theatre.</p>
<h1><strong>What is Pipe Dreams Studio Theatre?</strong></h1>
<p>Pipe Dreams Studio Theatre is a 90 seat black box theatre located near Millikin University in Decatur, IL. With the creation of the new B.F.A Theatre Administration degree in the Department of Theatre &amp; Dance, the faculty began to wonder how they could give students a ""hands-on"" approach to running a theatre. Pipe Dreams Studio Theatre was then generously donated to the students to run as a company and to produce the work we want to see.</p>
<p>All of our work is done by the students and entirely on a volunteer basis. Each individual student is required to do “lab hours” for the semester for those enrolled in the Entrepreneurship: Pipe Dreams Studio Theatre course. However, anyone who is interested in volunteering with us is highly encouraged and welcomed.</p>
<p>In the past, students have utilized our space to create the work they wanted to see: whether it be original or published work. In the Spring 2011 season we had both original and published works. In addition we took on the task of producing our first production: an original work titled Affinity.</p>
<h1><strong>What do we want to DO?</strong></h1>
<p>Last fall you helped us produce our first <strong>FULLY PRODUCED </strong>season. In a mere <strong>3 Days </strong>you helped us reach our goal of $800 to fund the technical aspects of our productions. </p>
<p>Now we are in a critical state. In theatre, the lighting is one of the most obvious design elements. Imagine seeing a show with set and costume but no light. <strong>This is the fate that Pipe Dreams Studio Theatre is now facing. </strong></p>
<p>In theatre we use dimmers to control the power that our lighting instruments receive. Recently 6 of our dimmers died. That's right. They went caput in the middle of a technical rehearsal. In order to maintain the high artistic quality we achieved last season, <strong>we need your help</strong>. </p>
<p>To keep the lights on in Pipe Dreams Studio Theatre we <strong>MUST</strong> get a new dimmer rack. <strong>YOU</strong> can flip the switch; <strong>YOU</strong> can keep the lights on.</p>
<h1><strong>How can YOU help?</strong></h1>
<p>By donating to our campaign, you'll be supporting emerging artists as they create work they want to create. There's also a plethora of gifts and rewards for donating to our campaign with everything from complimentary tickets to <span style=""font-style: italic;"">having our light booth named after you</span>!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And because Pipe Dreams Studio Theatre is a non-profit organization, your donation is <span style=""font-style: italic;"">100% tax decuctable</span>!</p>

<p>With the lights on we'll be able to produce our two fantastic productions:</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>We are a group of seven. We've got a playwright, a director, a producer, three actors, and a playwright's brother who helps in all ways possible. For the past couple of months we have been working on this little play called <i>Scottish Sperm </i>written by our very own Jacqueline McLaren. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We've had readings through New York City, fundraisers, beer blasts, numerous amount of rehearsals, and we are about to put our New York run of the show at Pace University in downtown Manhattan. After this is all said and done, we will head over to Edinburgh, Scotland to participate in the Edinburgh Festival Fringe for the entire month of August. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Edinburgh Festival Fringe is the largest arts festival in the world and takes place every year for three weeks in August. Our show will be one of literally thousands. We will be performing a total of 20 times at The Space @ Jury's Inn. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Meet Us:</p>
<p><br/></p>

<p>Jacqueline McLaren (Playwright) is a playwright known for her irreverent, cutting humor and ear for dialogue. Scottish Sperm will be Ms. McLaren's first production at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. Ms. McLaren's previous play How to Build a Bomb won the Olga and Paul Menn Foundation Award. How to Build a Bomb was also selected for PACE University's New Works Festival in Manhattan in 2010. Two of Ms. McLaren's plays were chosen for the University Theater's New Plays Festivals in Chicago. Ms. McLaren is a writer on Tu Nite con Lorenzo Parro, on NBC/Telemundo, that network's first bilingual talk show. Ms. McLaren is a graduate of the University of Chicago. She taught at several public schools in the notoriously rough South Side of Chicago throughout her four years.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Apparently, theatre costs a lot of money and there isn't a whole lot of it circulating around. We've got to pay for things like venues, food for the actors, advertising, props, plane tickets, living expenses, and the list goes on. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>If we don't raise enough money, there is a chance we won't all make it to Scotland. And for this show to work in it's entirety and to fullest potential, it is ESSENTIAL that we all make it there.  </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The most important thing to know is that the group of has been working extremely hard to get this incredible piece to international audiences. It is a chance to show our art to people who would never see it otherwise, and for many of us, to finally begin our careers in theatre. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our ultimate goal is $5,000. In the time allotted we realize this might be an overreach but the show is incredibly important to us all and we have done everything and anything to make sure we can make Scottish Sperm succeed. After all, it is ""the strongest"".</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Okay so here is the breakdown.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>$750 - airfare which will make sure that we all get there. </p>
<p>$1,000 - venue </p>
<p>100-200 pounds - for food for each cast member every week. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Anything extra goes to advertising, perishable props, shipping props from NY to Scotland,  petty cash, and anything else we run into along the way. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>As said previously, with the help of Tilicoultry Media, we've been raising money through staged readings at places like Ars Nova and TJ Byrnes Bar and Restaurant where we received generous donations from Scottish Sperm Bank Donors. We've had beer blasts in Williamsburg, Brooklyn where we raised hundreds of dollars from college students throughout NYC. We're also raising money through our New York run at Pace University, 7/21-7/23. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>But it is still not enough! </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>No matter what, this show will go up in Scotland in August. We would just like all 7 of us to be there in order for it everything to run smoothly.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>All new Scottish Sperm Bank donors will be added to our Generous Contributors list in our program. </b></p>

</div></div>","Our Story
We are a group of seven. We've got a playwright, a director, a producer, three actors, and a playwright's brother who helps in all ways possible. For the past couple of months we have been working on this little play called Scottish Sperm written by our very own Jacqueline McLaren. 

We've had readings through New York City, fundraisers, beer blasts, numerous amount of rehearsals, and we are about to put our New York run of the show at Pace University in downtown Manhattan. After this is all said and done, we will head over to Edinburgh, Scotland to participate in the Edinburgh Festival Fringe for the entire month of August. 

Edinburgh Festival Fringe is the largest arts festival in the world and takes place every year for three weeks in August. Our show will be one of literally thousands. We will be performing a total of 20 times at The Space @ Jury's Inn. 

Meet Us:


Jacqueline McLaren (Playwright) is a playwright known for her irreverent, cutting humor and ear for dialogue. Scottish Sperm will be Ms. McLaren's first production at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. Ms. McLaren's previous play How to Build a Bomb won the Olga and Paul Menn Foundation Award. How to Build a Bomb was also selected for PACE University's New Works Festival in Manhattan in 2010.

The Impact
Apparently, theatre costs a lot of money and there isn't a whole lot of it circulating around. We've got to pay for things like venues, food for the actors, advertising, props, plane tickets, living expenses, and the list goes on. 

If we don't raise enough money, there is a chance we won't all make it to Scotland. And for this show to work in it's entirety and to fullest potential, it is ESSENTIAL that we all make it there.  

The most important thing to know is that the group of has been working extremely hard to get this incredible piece to international audiences. It is a chance to show our art to people who would never see it otherwise, and for many of us, to finally begin our careers in theatre. 

What We Need & What You Get
Our ultimate goal is $5,000. In the time allotted we realize this might be an overreach but the show is incredibly important to us all and we have done everything and anything to make sure we can make Scottish Sperm succeed. After all, it is ""the strongest"".

Okay so here is the breakdown.

$750 - airfare which will make sure that we all get there. 
$1,000 - venue 
100-200 pounds - for food for each cast member every week. 

Anything extra goes to advertising, perishable props, shipping props from NY to Scotland,  petty cash, and anything else we run into along the way. 

As said previously, with the help of Tilicoultry Media, we've been raising money through staged readings at places like Ars Nova and TJ Byrnes Bar and Restaurant where we received generous donations from Scottish Sperm Bank Donors. We've had beer blasts in Williamsburg, Brooklyn where we raised hundreds of dollars from college students throughout NYC. We're also raising money through our New York run at Pace University, 7/21-7/23. 

But it is still not enough! 

No matter what, this show will go up in Scotland in August. We would just like all 7 of us to be there in order for it everything to run smoothly.

All new Scottish Sperm Bank donors will be added to our Generous Contributors list in our program. 

$1-$5 - A virtual high-five!

$5-$75 - You will receive a special thank you on your Facebook wall or email from one of the Scottish Sperm  cast members!

$100 - Receive a personalized video from all of us to you!

$200-$500 - A personalized video as well as an autographed Scottish program from the entire cast and team.
 
$1,000 or more - Personalized video, autographed Scottish program, and a wonderful Scottish souvenir personally picked out just for you. 

Even $1 helps us in a great way!


NOTE: None of us are getting paid for this! Our payment has been the fortunate experience of being able to go to Scotland and participate in the Fringe.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Two young girls, Shelley and Jessica, escaped the dolldrums of old toys and older brothers to venture on a trip to Florida with nothing but empty blue suitcases.  They quickly returned home after realizing 4 and 7 year olds were much too young for the mean streets of the city.  They vowed to one day escape for good.  Many years later, they have honoured that vow by not only committing to a life of escape (ie. acting) but by founding Empty Suitcase Theatre.  We are committed to producing plays that offer strong female roles and put the women front and center, increase community involvement, as well as engaging and inspiring the audience.  Our first production 'Some Girl (s)' by Neil LaBute will do exactly this....with your help!!</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We believe we can further community understanding and appreciation of the arts by increasing their involvement.  Including the public in programming decisions will not only engage the community, but hopefully create the desire to contribute to the growth and maintenance of Toronto's art scene.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are looking to raise $5000 for our first production.  This would cover the cost of renting the venue, marketing (flyers, programs, website,etc.) Set design and lighting.  We are also committed to helping our starving artists earn an income doing what they love.  This will most likely be a small honorarium for the first season, but utlimately would like to develop a repertory company that would allow our actors to finally give up their day jobs!</p>
<p>By contributing, your donation ensures that regardless of whether or not we meet our fundraising goal, the production will go on.  There will also be many perks for helping us meet our goal.  Keep an eye out for what goodies are offered for each donation level.  <br/></p>

Who We Are:
4401 Hangashore Productions is a non-for-profit, student run production company out of Memorial University of Newfoundland under the English Department's Theatre and Film Communications Diploma, taught by Danielle Irvine.
4401 is the Producing The Play class, which allows it's students a real life experience in Producing a play, and all the roles that go with it (such as publicity, set design, stage managing, lights, etc) under the directed guidance of renowned Director, Danielle Irvine.
The Play:
This year 4401 is producing The Laramie Project under the production company Hangashore Productions.
The Laramie Project is a brutally honest play written by Moises Kaufman and Tectonic Theater Project about the 1998 murder of Matthew Shepard, a young gay man, in the small town of Laramie, Wyoming. The play itself consist of direct bits of interviews conducted by Moises and the Tetonic Theater Project with the closely knitted residents of Laramie during the year after Matthew's death.
The play will be held at The LSPU Hall, directed by Danielle Irvine, and starring: Steve O'Connell, Selena Asgar, Bruce Benton, David Feehan, Brad Bonell, Margaret Hild, Natalia Hennely, and Sandy Gow.
Why This Play Is Important:
LBGTQ related hate crimes have been plauging society for many years, but October 12th, 1998 the world stood still and all eyes landed on Laramie, Wyoming in the wake of one of the most brutal, and surprising hate crimes in America.
Matthew Shepard, an out gay man, left The Fireside bar with Aaron McKinney and Russell Henderson one night, and was driven out to the farthest reaches of the town of Laramie, and than tied to a fence, and tortured, beaten, and left to die over night. Matthew was found in a coma the next morning, and offically died a few days later on October 12th, never haven woken up.
The play itself focuses on the effects of such a violent tragedy on such a small and tight knit town like Laramie, and it's population. Laramie itself is no different than St. John's, and is no bigger than Gander. All the people know each other someway or another, and it's populous felt safe and trusting before the events. 
This play not only shows the devastating social ramifications on the States and LBGTQ human rights as a whole, but also shows the destruction of the small town mentality and the abolition of a false sense of security a tight knit town can bring, and how one simple act can change a town and it's people, forever.

we are Little Bulb Theatre and we've been making and touring devised and
physical theatre since 2008.  We are about to embark on our first U.K tour
with our biggest show to date, a gypsy jazz opera, called <i>Orpheus</i>, a Little Bulb and
Battersea Arts Centre co-production. We're very excited to be taking this show
to a number of incredible cities and venues around the country, and we
need your help with the last little bit of funding to make the tour the best it
can be. </span></p>
<p>With your

protect and maintain all of the instruments used in the show. Investing in our
kit now will make a huge difference to this tour, and to our company. Owning
our own piano, and ensuring the longevity of the other 15+ instruments used in <i>Orpheus </i>will help us to share this much
loved show with new audiences, both on this tour and in the future. </p>

performances which explore and illuminate minute human details that, in a world

that with humour and sadness will touch, startle and entertain.</p>

<p><br/></p><p>Following two
sold-out runs at Battersea Arts Centre and at the world-renowned Salzburg
Festival, we are now gearing up for a UK tour of<i>Orpheus</i>. This
will be our largest tour to date, enabling us to reach new audiences of over
8,000 people across 27 performances in five incredible venues: Birmingham
Repertory Theatre, Bristol Old Vic, Liverpool Everyman, Royal Opera House
Linbury Studio and Nuffield Theatre Southampton.  Needless to say we're
incredibly excited and thrilled to be taking the show out on the road, but
there are huge costs involved in making a tour-able version, and this is where
we look to you for help.</p>
<p><b><u><br/></u></b></p><p><b><u>What We Need</u></b></p>
<p>Music has
played an integral part in all of our past productions, but <i>Orpheus</i> puts it right at its heart.
 For this crowdfunding campaign we are aiming to raise £6,000 to enable us
to buy the necessary equipment to make the show a more sustainable outfit, for
this tour and subsequent outings. </p>
<p>Money you
donate will enable us to:</p>
<p><b>a)</b> Buy a new
piano that the company would then own and tour with (saving us from the
logistical nightmare of hiring pianos at every venue). This piano will become a
brilliant asset for the company as we plan future tours.</p>
<p><b>b) </b>Buy hard
cases for instruments - accordion, double bass and harp - which currently don’t
have them, ensuring their longevity for this tour and beyond.</p>
<p><b>c) </b>Fix and
maintain all of the instruments in the show (of which there are 15+). Though we
love our instruments and are as careful with them as possible, touring
and performing in a high octane production means that they incur
inevitable scrapes and bumps that can affect the sound and tuning.  Your
support will enable us to ensure our instruments are cared for and serviced by
experts so that we can make the best sound possible.</p>
<p><b>d)</b> In
additional to these costs we would use any remaining funding towards rebuilding
an adaptable version of the set that can be easily transferred to fit any
appropriate venue. Our original bespoke set was designed for Battersea Arts
Centre’s Grand Hall, and as such needs to be completely re-designed for
touring. We aspire to make a structure that is able to adapt to any venue with
the capacity and desire to house <i>Orpheus</i>.</p>
<p><b><u><br/></u></b></p><p><b><u>The Impact</u></b></p>
<p>With a cast of
8 and a production team of 6 on the road,<i>Orpheus </i>is
by far our largest-scale production to date. The response to the show both
at Battersea Arts Centre and in Salzburg was something neither we or BAC
had seen before or anticipated. Audiences returned several times to see the
show in 1930’s inspired get-up; we received critical acclaim in the national
press and people rose to their feet to dance in the aisles during the
interval. This tour will enable us to share this much-loved show in venues
we have never performed in before. Your support will mean we can create a truly
special experience for every single audience member, using our instruments to
transform spaces and transport people to 1930’s Paris and the mythical
underworld beyond. </p>

Róisín O'Brien is the director and choreographer. 'Entrails' is her brain child. She's completing a Diploma in Dance Studies at Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance in London.
Laura Jones is a co-producer. She's currently based in Edinburgh and is a book production and promotion freelancer.

You can find out more detail about the team on our website.
   The show




'Entrails' is a contemporary dance theatre piece inspired by Joseph Heller's Catch-22, a book that has remained with Róisín long after a first reading. She was inspired by this particular quote:


“Yossarian was cold, too, and shivering uncontrollably. He felt goose pimples clacking all over him as he gazed down despondently at the grim secret Snowden had spilled all over the messy floor. It was too easy to read the message in his entrails. Man was matter, that was Snowden’s secret. Drop him out a window and he’ll fall. Set fire to him and he’ll burn. Bury him and he’ll rot, like other kinds of garbage. The spirit gone, man is garbage. That was Snowden’s secret. Ripeness is all.”



The show will confront our fragility, our messiness and our transience and present a dark and absurd look at our human bodies. Bodies that malfunction yet persist. Bodies that are denigrated and manipulated. Bodies that resist.

'Entrails' will run from August 12 - 27, 12:50pm - 1:40pm at theSpace @ Venue 45.
   
Where the money goes


£600 will cover a single instalment for our venue hire which is costing £2,000. We have already paid £1,000 by this point through our own savings and the final £1,000 is due at the beginning of July. It's a big ask so we very thankful for every single contribution which helps bring us closer to securing the venue and putting on our dream show!


The perks
 

Whether you can help us out with a penny or several pounds we want to give everyone at least a small personal thank you. Particular highlights include:



Personalised thank yous from us in emails, on the website, on social media and in ye olde handwriting posted right to your door.
Help us out and receive merch: pin badges, signed flyers and posters.

Original dance and artwork specially commissioned just for you.
And, of course, there's free tickets and an invite to our launch celebration in Edinburgh for the extra generous.

   Risks & challenges The main risks and challenges:  If we are unable to meet the payment deadline we risk losing the venue. If we lose the venue we also lose the £1,000 already put down and in all likeliness, the show itself will have to be cancelled.
We'll be overjoyed if we come out of August having broken even and this will be a challenge in itself. Your pledges bring up a step closer to bringing us out of the red. 
We're scraping together every hard-earned spare penny we have to make this happen but with your help we can meet our payment deadline sooner and focus on making 'Entrails' an unmissable and unforgettable show.

<h3>The Impact</h3>Why this play now? This play has been in my dreams for four years now. I chose <i>The World We Live In </i>because it’s got a sense of danger to it. I wanted to compress this powerful play into something explosive. With the political world in an uncertain (and in many ways frightening) state, it’s important to take a step back and look at ourselves in the mirror - or to quote Hamlet,<i>“to hold, as 'twere, the mirror up to nature.”</i>  Too often we delude ourselves into thinking the way we live our lives is without consequence. From social media to the infamous “Seattle freeze,” we have become so self-involved in our <i>idea</i> of life that we forget what it means to <i>live</i>. This play reminds me to open my eyes and look for light in the world, and I can't wait to share it with you. <br/>
</div>
<div><h3>Track Record</h3></div>
<div>In the past six months I have workshopped and directed a concert-style staged reading of a new musical by Leah Erickson Webster <i>You: &amp; Other Things That Shouldn’t Matter But Do</i>. It was a huge success and went on to become a studio recording and radio play--all made possible by small contributions from people like you! I assistant directed  main stage plays in both the Fall and the Spring seasons at Cornish. As I make my directorial debut, all of my experiences with peers, artists and directors I admire have given me the courage to create something truly meaningful. I have the distinct privilege of working with some of Seattle’s most talented up-and-coming actors and designers, and this play has given them a platform to foster a sense of agency and professionalism. When given the opportunity to create something big with me--they said yes. <br/>

</div></div>","Our Story
About
seven years ago Noah Davis wrote a little six page two-hander play called Different,  which won a short play contest
and was awarded a run at the Beaumont Studios in Vancouver.  Noah and his close friend Mylène Dinh-Robic took the stage to give the play life.  The audience‘s reaction to the play was
profound, it seemed to open the door on all sorts of discussion and
debate, and many asked the question:  “What
happens next with these characters?”  
 
Noah
balked at the idea that Different
should be a longer play, indignantly stating that the piece was meant to stand
alone.  The reality is he was scared of how
much work, energy and heart would be required to tell this complete
story.  
 
However,
as time passed Noah got over himself and sat down to turn Different into a full length play. 
Those original pages were expanded, massaged and built into the first
of three scenes which follow two characters, Scott and Susan, as their
relationship is thrown into turmoil by the tectonic shifting of buried trauma.  The new play, Point No Point, is now ready to take the stage for the first
time. 
 
In
a beautiful twist of fate Noah & Mylène
have found themselves together again, this time in Toronto, eager to dig into
the new material.  One of the first
people Noah met off the plane was David Tompa, who is a fixture in the
independent theatre scene in Toronto. 
David’s talent, style and enthusiasm for Point No Point make him the perfect fit for directing this
piece.  
 
Under
the Chainsaw Theatre Co-op, Mylène, Noah
and David have come together with creative lust to build a simple, poignant,
compelling, relevant piece of theatre.  
 
Point
No Point is a landmass on the West Coast of Vancouver Island.  It is a place of beauty.  It is a place which juxtaposes the serenity
of misty rainforest with the violence of the Pacific thrashing dark jagged rock.  It is this place which puts a crack in the
dam that contains the story of our play.

The Impact
This
play, Point No Point, is a deep look
at love.  Love at its messiest.  Love at its hardest.  The play asks more questions than it answers.  It lives in the gray area between love and
logic, right and wrong, joy and pain.  
 
The
characters, Susan and Scott, are real and accessible giving audiences a moment
to reflect on their own lives, relationships and adversities.
 
What We Need & What You Get
We
need to cover the costs of production for
Point No Point.  Rental of the venue,
material for set build, technicians, lighting design, props, promotional material and insurance are some of the more significant costs.
 
Our
goal of $2500 is only a fraction of the funding needed to properly mount this
show.  We are investing our own money and holding
fund-raising events to make up other costs which will likely exceed
$8000.  SO, if we can exceed our Indie
GoGo goal, that would take the pressure off us tremendously.  Either way this show will go up on stage!  We are in rehearsal and the theatre is
booked.  Please help us by taking some of the
financial pressure off and allowing us to do everything we can to give this
play the production it deserves.  

The more we can raise, the better.  Extra funds will go towards a strong publicity campaign, and setting up future productions of Point No Point (Montreal, Vancouver, Los Angeles, New York?).
 
We
have several perks of helping our campaign, including the chance to come see Point No Point on stage, copies of the
script and early drafts, and even holidays involving the play!  Check out our Perks section for more
details.  

Please ACT NOW!  We have a very limited time-frame to get funded, as our show premiers on July 21st.

<p><span><span>I am an aspiring actor in the San Francisco Bay Area who needs more training to further my skills and my career. My dream is to study with Shakespeare &amp; Company in Lenox, Massachusetts. <br/><br/>The full tuition is nearly $10,000. Between grants, savings and financial aid, I've been able to accrue almost $6000, but I'm still $4000 shy. And the training starts this Fall! <br/><br/>So, how about it? Can you help me make my dream a reality?</span></span></p>
<h2><span><span>This is my story</span></span></h2>
<p>I've been acting semi-professionally for more than a decade now, working with amazing artists and getting to play amazing roles. Most of my acting career thus far has been spent learning on the job and supporting myself with other skills but, basically, I've have come to the realization that my career as it stands is simply not sustainable. Living paycheck to paycheck. Missing work to attend auditions that won't even pay minimum wage if I book them. I've gotten to the point where the theatres that pay a living wage see me for auditions fairly often, yet I've never booked one of those gigs.</p>
<p>When I learned that Shakespeare &amp; Comapany offered an Acting Conservatory for a dozen actors to study intensively for three and a half months, I knew that if I could get there it was likely to give my abilities just the push they needed to help me break into the ranks of working professional actors. So I applied, was accepted, and even got a tuition break, but can still only cover a roughly half of what I owe. So I am launching this indiegogo campaign to fundraise the balance of my Conservatory tuition. Which in turn will certainly change my life, but also give me a better shot at acting full-time and supporting myself with my art.</p>
<h3>So, what the heck is Shakespeare &amp; Company?</h3>
<p>Shakespeare &amp; Company is a thirty-five-year-old theatre company in the Berkshire Hills of western Massachusetts. They strive to create ""theatre of unprecedented excellence rooted in the classical ideals of inquiry, balance, and harmony...[performing] as the Elizabethans did — in love with poetry, physical prowess, and the mysteries of the universe"" while also producing new plays. ""Actors, directors, writers, and teachers from all over the world come to work with the Company's faculty... training their voices and bodies with demanding classes, while delving deeply into their own imaginations, intellects, and emotional lives."" While this sounds pretty far out, I have watched the Shakes faculty work and I have to say, they are one hundred percent for real. And although they use exclusively Shakespearean text, their training prepares you to be a better actor on stage or screen, with classic or contemporary texts. For evidence, check out some Shakes &amp; Co. alums that are on my super short list of freakin' awesome, including Richard Dreyfuss, Bill Murray, Oliver Platt, Sigourney Weaver, and Anna Deavere Smith, to name but a few.</p>
<h3>Let me break it down</h3>
<p>The tuition for the Acting Conservatory is $9800. Between financial aid, grants and my savings I have come up with more than half that total, leaving me $4000 short. Up until very recently I had hoped to bring that number down with work-study, but I was informed only yesterday that there are no work study positions available at this time. This campaign is for $4350: enough to pay the balance of my tuition ($4000) and the related indiegogo fees (4%-9% indiegogo + 3% credit card/paypal). In the inconceivable event that I raise MORE than my goal, my head will explode. After reassembling the pieces, I will use any additional funding to buy the airfare to get there and my groceries while I study, instead of resorting to a credit card. But the tuition is the thing. Reaching my goal here would mean my tuition is taken care of in the nick of time (The program starts September 10th, yikes!), and I can focus on squeezing every scrap of learnin' from them thar Berkshire hills.</p>
<h3>So here goes...</h3>
<p>My modest proposal is that we make a deal: You hire me to do something for you in 2013 (after I return from the conservatory), but pay me now. Then, for the fall of 2012, I can go to Lenox, Massachusetts and change my acting career and my life. Or think of it this way: I want to trade you the skills I want for the skills I have.</p>
<p>In exchange for me receiving world class training in acting, Linklater voice work, Shakespearean text analysis, rhetoric, Elizabethan dance, clowning, stage combat and a role in King John on the Shakes &amp; Co. mainstage, I can offer sewing, office work, editing, research, drawing, painting, organization, cleaning, horrible jokes, life coaching, cooking, babysitting, photojournalism, make up artistry, and hairstyling. And other things I'll remember later. Think about it. I've almost certainly mentioned something you'd either pay for anyway or wish you had an excuse to. Well, blessedly, my future is a fabulous excuse!</p>
<p>The perks to the right are some concrete examples of work I can do for you, but it's just to get you started. I'm really excited to get out there and get the skills to be a better actor who works more and I am going to find a way somehow. And if we trade my services for the funding that will get me there, then everyone wins.</p>
<h3>You can't give $ but you can give &lt;3</h3>
<p>Of course, not everyone can throw down benjamins but everyone can give the love! Sharing this post on your facebook page or twitter feed (or just good old-fashioned telling someone about it) will help bring my campaign to more folks attention.

I am an aspiring actor in the San Francisco Bay Area who needs more training to further my skills and my career. My dream is to study with Shakespeare & Company in Lenox, Massachusetts. The full tuition is nearly $10,000. Between grants, savings and financial aid, I've been able to accrue almost $6000, but I'm still $4000 shy. And the training starts this Fall! So, how about it? Can you help me make my dream a reality?
This is my story
I've been acting semi-professionally for more than a decade now, working with amazing artists and getting to play amazing roles. Most of my acting career thus far has been spent learning on the job and supporting myself with other skills but, basically, I've have come to the realization that my career as it stands is simply not sustainable. Living paycheck to paycheck. Missing work to attend auditions that won't even pay minimum wage if I book them. I've gotten to the point where the theatres that pay a living wage see me for auditions fairly often, yet I've never booked one of those gigs.
When I learned that Shakespeare & Comapany offered an Acting Conservatory for a dozen actors to study intensively for three and a half months, I knew that if I could get there it was likely to give my abilities just the push they needed to help me break into the ranks of working professional actors. So I applied, was accepted, and even got a tuition break, but can still only cover a roughly half of what I owe. So I am launching this indiegogo campaign to fundraise the balance of my Conservatory tuition. Which in turn will certainly change my life, but also give me a better shot at acting full-time and supporting myself with my art.
So, what the heck is Shakespeare & Company?
Shakespeare & Company is a thirty-five-year-old theatre company in the Berkshire Hills of western Massachusetts. They strive to create ""theatre of unprecedented excellence rooted in the classical ideals of inquiry, balance, and harmony...[performing] as the Elizabethans did — in love with poetry, physical prowess, and the mysteries of the universe"" while also producing new plays. ""Actors, directors, writers, and teachers from all over the world come to work with the Company's faculty... training their voices and bodies with demanding classes, while delving deeply into their own imaginations, intellects, and emotional lives."" While this sounds pretty far out, I have watched the Shakes faculty work and I have to say, they are one hundred percent for real. And although they use exclusively Shakespearean text, their training prepares you to be a better actor on stage or screen, with classic or contemporary texts. For evidence, check out some Shakes & Co. alums that are on my super short list of freakin' awesome, including Richard Dreyfuss, Bill Murray, Oliver Platt, Sigourney Weaver, and Anna Deavere Smith, to name but a few.
Let me break it down
The tuition for the Acting Conservatory is $9800. Between financial aid, grants and my savings I have come up with more than half that total, leaving me $4000 short. Up until very recently I had hoped to bring that number down with work-study, but I was informed only yesterday that there are no work study positions available at this time. This campaign is for $4350: enough to pay the balance of my tuition ($4000) and the related indiegogo fees (4%-9% indiegogo + 3% credit card/paypal). In the inconceivable event that I raise MORE than my goal, my head will explode. After reassembling the pieces, I will use any additional funding to buy the airfare to get there and my groceries while I study, instead of resorting to a credit card. But the tuition is the thing. Reaching my goal here would mean my tuition is taken care of in the nick of time (The program starts September 10th, yikes!), and I can focus on squeezing every scrap of learnin' from them thar Berkshire hills.
So here goes...
My modest proposal is that we make a deal: You hire me to do something for you in 2013 (after I return from the conservatory), but pay me now. Then, for the fall of 2012, I can go to Lenox, Massachusetts and change my acting career and my life. Or think of it this way: I want to trade you the skills I want for the skills I have.
In exchange for me receiving world class training in acting, Linklater voice work, Shakespearean text analysis, rhetoric, Elizabethan dance, clowning, stage combat and a role in King John on the Shakes & Co. mainstage, I can offer sewing, office work, editing, research, drawing, painting, organization, cleaning, horrible jokes, life coaching, cooking, babysitting, photojournalism, make up artistry, and hairstyling. And other things I'll remember later. Think about it. I've almost certainly mentioned something you'd either pay for anyway or wish you had an excuse to. Well, blessedly, my future is a fabulous excuse!
The perks to the right are some concrete examples of work I can do for you, but it's just to get you started. I'm really excited to get out there and get the skills to be a better actor who works more and I am going to find a way somehow. And if we trade my services for the funding that will get me there, then everyone wins.
You can't give $ but you can give <3
Of course, not everyone can throw down benjamins but everyone can give the love! Sharing this post on your facebook page or twitter feed (or just good old-fashioned telling someone about it) will help bring my campaign to more folks attention. Even giving me a call to convey your support would be downright awesome. If you're especially swamped, telepathy is totally cool, too. Yowza, I can feel it now...
That's all folks!
Thanks so much for your time. Really. You are AMAZING, and I am so grateful.
Wish me luck!

<h2>Hi everybody!</h2>
<p>Juanita and Andrew here. We are renovating and re-opening the old movie theater in Alvin on E. House Street. We all believe every small town needs it's own movie theater, and Alvin is no different. We also really love what is going on in the downtown district and on Gordon Street and want to be a part of it.</p>
<p>You may not know this, but for the first 100 years of cinemas, movies were projected on mechanical film projectors. Starting in the last 10 years, the movie studios have been pushing cinemas to move to digital projection as they save millions of dollars in distribution costs by not having to create the very expensive film prints anymore. Digital movie prints come on cheap hard drives and are 15-25 times cheaper per print over film projection. The movie studios are going to start phasing out film prints later this year and should be completely out of the film based distribution by the summer of 2014</p>
<p>This is why we need your help. We can't get the money the traditional route, so we are going to try crowd sourcing the funding by selling discounted gift cards, t-shirts, posters, and more.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The stuff we need</h3>
<p>As we said, we need to retrofit the projection booth with all new equipment.</p>
<p>Here is what we will be purchasing and the associated costs.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Series 2 Projector DLP projector (Barco, NEC, Christie)    $40,000</p>
<p>Digital Cinema Server System                                   $10,000</p>
<p>Digital cinema audio processor                                    $2,200</p>
<p>Accessories for projector system (cables, mounts, etc)      $8,000</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The more cash we raise, the more screens we can convert upfront, which means more movies, and we will get them sooner as digital print availability will continue to grow and film availability sink. Our other option is to source used equipment. This is a more difficult (and time consuming task), but we can save as much as 50% of these costs by going the used route. Our first choice is to get good used equipment as we can convert 2 screens for the price of 1 new system.</p>
<p>We set the funding goal at $15,000, but could use significantly more!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Why we think this is important</h3>
<p>We really do think it is important for every town to have its own movie theater. The movies have always been a place for everybody, from the youngest to old, richest to poorest, native born or immigrant. Everybody goes to the movies! The problem for Alvin residents is that they have to drive 12-15 miles to the closest theater, which limits both your likelihood of going as well as raises your total cost of a night out (gas prices being what they are, and all!). We love that the House Street theater is smack dab in the middle of Alvin, no more than 10 minutes from any resident to get there.</p>
<p>If we don't move fast, the space will continue to deteriorate and become increasingly expensive to renovate. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We know some folks can't contribute directly, but we can still use your help to spread the word about saving the Alvin theater! Link people to this page in e-mail, on Facebook, Twitter, etc. You have no idea how valuable this can be for us!</p>

 West End or the provinces. The creative team and cast feel passionately about getting the musical in front of a larger audience of investors, sponsors, patrons and producers all we need now is your help. What we are raising the funds for
We need £20,000 to put on the concert performance of Mrs Gucci The Musical in Milan. Your money will be used to pay for the Theatre, flights, hotels, projections, translators, actors, staff, transport, equipment hire, a grand piano, technical staff, crew, marketing, rehearsals and everything else needed to put on a production in another country! All in order 
to attract investors and producers for a fully fledged West End run 
later in 2014. As a thank you for your support we have some amazing unique perks including a digital download or CD of the London concert performance, a hard copy of the current script and if we raise more than our target we aim to stream the concert live from Milan to a browser near you.In the event that we do not reach our goal we will use the funds raised to do a workshop/showcase in London for angels, investors and producers.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The In the House Festival believes that arts and culture are essential to a vibrant and community-oriented society. Music, dance, theatre, spoken word, circus, puppetry are all art forms that make the world go round. Trouble is,  most of the time it's not readily accessible. The In the House Festival changes all that by bringing all these things and more right to your doorstep - literally!</p>
<p>Over the 3 days of the festival (June 1-3, 2012), 13 houses open their doors to live performances of all genres. People get to explore the vast amount of talent that exists in Vancouver - discovering new bands, taking in breathtaking dance, gasping at dare-devil acrobatics. Whatever you're into, it's there!</p>
<p>The In the House Festival is going into its 9th year! It has become a cultural beacon for many - both audience members and performers alike. </p>
<p>Your contribution to the festival not only allows it to continue being a reality but also supports the over 80 acts that perform at the festival. You become a part of the cultural landscape of Vancouver in a very real and concrete way.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are striving really hard to be able to pay fair rates for the artists and the production team. With the major funding cuts the province and the country have perpertrated, this is getting harder and harder to do and we increasingly need the public's support. Last year, we lost 11,000$ in funding. This year is not looking any better. As you can imagine, that's a huge loss to a grass-roots, community festival.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Don't take it from us. Here's what people have said about the festival.</p>
<p>From the performers:</p>
<p>""This was my 7<sup>th</sup> year performing at this wonderful event. I have had a notable career in music, being signed to a record deal for 6 years, touring endlessly and playing for thousands of people. This quaint festival is still and always will be one of the highlights of my musical career. In The House is an East Vancouver gem. It’s one of the events in Vancouver that are so unique and hip that it reminds me of why I love living here. It’s wholesome and expresses our vast diversity in the most harmonious way... The fact that people open up their homes to strangers for these performances only shows the trust, love and connection people have in the East Van community.""        -Yvette Narlock, musician</p>
<p>""I've had the opportunity to participate with 'In the House Festival' over the past several years in 3 capacities: performer, host &amp; audience. In each case I've been thoroughly delighted and impressed by the festival, its organisation and scope."" - Simon Kendall, musician</p>
<p>""Each year, I attend the Festival as I regard it as one of the significant performing venues in Vancouver because of its excellence in artistic performances, its ability to create a sense of well being and, most of all, for its achievement as a community builder."" - Mary Gavan, storyteller</p>
<p>From the media:</p>
<p>""It's a fresh approach to the festival model, and one that seems particularly vital given the shortage of smaller live music venues in Vancouver."" - Jennifer Moss, Vancouver Sun</p>
<p>""Creative triumph: Initiative of the In the House model opens doors to the future."" Stuart Derdeyn, The Province</p>
<p>""In The House Festival is the kind of festival that could and should happen in many more communities."" - Life is a Festival</p>
<p>""Vancouver's underground arts economy is booming. Tired of stuffy concert halls and exorbitant ticket prices, cultural entrepreneurs are hosting high-calibre performances in their living rooms"" -Adriana Barton, BC Business</p>
<p>""One of the most satisfying aspects of In The House Festival is to see the seperation between artist, host, and audience break down in the informal settings."" -Tony Montague, Georgia Straight</p>
<p>""While you'd be wrong to think that house shows faded away around the same time as cassette tapes, the idea of invading a stranger's home for a show might seem too cozy. It is this very coziness that makes Vancouver's In The House Festival unique."" - Carly Lewis, Exclaim!</p>
<p>From audience members:</p>
<p>""I have been very impressed with the range of programming offered in a format that is truly inviting and engaging to the general public.  The mix of genres and disciplines provides audiences with exposure to art forms that they may not normally experience, and in an environment (House) that allows for a breaking down of barriers between audiences and artists and host venues/producers.  Most arts presentations today, whether they be not-for-profit or commercial, tend to separate audiences from the artistic world (including the producer), creating false barriers.  The In the House Festival succeeds in breaking down these barriers, and always providing a positive experience for both artists, audiences, and host Houses."" -Robert Benaroya</p>
<p>From hosts:</p>
<p>""For two years now I’ve opened my home to the circus.  The Circus!  In my house! My kids and I watch the yard be transformed from its everyday place of play and hockey and gardening and dinners at the picnic table into a sparkling magical stage."" -Marnie Goldenberg</p>

<h4><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal; white-space: pre;white-space:normal !important;"">After the initial performance on March 20th there will be further development and fundraising: there is a three week run at the Oval House pencilled for early 2012, following which the project will tour the UK and internationally. Let us know if you'd like us to bring the show to you.</span></h4>
<h4>
<span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal; white-space: pre;white-space:normal !important;""></span>WHAT WE NEED NOW -</h4>
<p>We need to raise $2,750 to cover our fees and expenses for the development of this project. We have until Valentine's Day, February 14th 2011 to do this. We hope that you can help us. </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""""><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-family: Arial;"">The total budget for the project is around
$10,000: $6,000 to be spent on artist’s fees, $1,500 on production
expenses, $1,500 on marketing and $1,000 on administrative costs. All fees are based on the Independent Theatre Council's recommended weekly rates.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""""><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-family: Arial;""></span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""color: rgb(77, 77, 77); font-family: Arial;"">There's an Arts Council England application currently pending which would fund about 75% of the development process. We'll know whether we've been awarded this by mid-january and will keep you updated. </span></p>

Which basically equates to the development costs of two of the five projects. So, if we raise $1,375, for instance, we could develop only four of the projects. </span></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""""><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-family: Arial;"">Most contributors will also be able to make a conceptual contribution (should they wish) and tell us how they'd like to save the earth.

THE FUTURE -

After the initial performance on March 20th there will be further development and fundraising: there is a three week run at the Oval House pencilled for early 2012, following which the project will tour the UK and internationally. Let us know if you'd like us to bring the show to you.

WHAT WE NEED NOW -
We need to raise $2,750 to cover our fees and expenses for the development of this project. We have until Valentine's Day, February 14th 2011 to do this. We hope that you can help us. 
The total budget for the project is around
$10,000: $6,000 to be spent on artist’s fees, $1,500 on production
expenses, $1,500 on marketing and $1,000 on administrative costs. All fees are based on the Independent Theatre Council's recommended weekly rates.
There's an Arts Council England application currently pending which would fund about 75% of the development process. We'll know whether we've been awarded this by mid-january and will keep you updated. 
Assuming, for now, that we are successful in obtaining the grant we need to raise $2,750 (£1,750) to supplement it. Which basically equates to the development costs of two of the five projects. So, if we raise $1,375, for instance, we could develop only four of the projects. 
WHAT YOU GET -
Every contributor will receive a thank you credit in the program for the March performance.
Most contributors will also be able to make a conceptual contribution (should they wish) and tell us how they'd like to save the earth. These suggestions will feed into the development process.
Higher contributors will receive tokens of our appreciation. Please see 'perks' for more information.
OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP -

If you like the idea of this project please tells other people about it and send them the link.

Lets's face it, no-one else is going to save us. We've got to save ourselves. x",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<div>Thank you everyone for your incredible generosity! I reached my goal within 5 days!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The campaign will remain open for the rest of the run so contributions are still welcome. Any additional funds will go towards accommodation while in transit (I need to overnight in Oslo on my way to Longyearbyen and back), equipment (an audio recorder for interviews, a tripod, Arctic-worthy boots, etc.), and fees associated with this campaign.</div>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Big Picture</h3>
<p>The inescapable reality of our changing climate will have a significant impact on how we organize ourselves in societies, what resources we exploit and how we respect and honor each other in a world where increased interconnectedness has collapsed the traditional six degrees of separation into one. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the Arctic where warming temperatures are displacing entire ecosystems and changing local populations' way of life. However, although there is a wealth of scientific data to explain these disruptions, we still lack the narratives that can help us organize these facts into stories of personal significance and turn a chaotic moment in human history into an opportunity for growth.</p>
<p>The Arctic Cycle -- a six-play cycle which explores the six regions of the High Arctic: United States, Canada, Greenland, Iceland, Norway, and Russia -- is my way of addressing this situation. The Cycle will look at the different facets of the Arctic and investigates how theatre can address the many challenges faced by communities on the frontline of climate change. Each play will focus on issues of significance to that particular region as well as examine how those connect to the rest of the world. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Project</h3>
<div>The first play of The Arctic Cycle, SILA, was commissioned by Mo`olelo Performing Arts Company in San Diego and focuses on Canada. It was workshopped at Mo`olelo and at Playwrights' Workshop Montréal, was presented as a public reading at the York University Conference<em> Staging Sustainability: Arts, Community, Culture, Environment</em> in Toronto, was a finalist for the New York Coalition of Professional Women in the Arts &amp; Media Collaboration Award and is scheduled for a more extensive workshop at the University of Connecticut in the spring of 2012.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The second play of the the Cycle, FORWARD, will focus on the Svalbard Archipelago (located midway between Norway and the North Pole) and investigate how Arctic sea ice has impacted human imagination throughout history. Taking its title from Norwegian explorer Fridtjof Nansen's ship <em>Fram</em>, which translates as <em>Forward</em> in English, the play will juxtapose three see voyages taking place at three different times in history: Nansen's 1895 North Pole expedition, a present-day luxury cruise retracing Nansen's steps and a cargo ship journey set in the future.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Now the exciting part: Research for the writing of FORWARD will take place during an upcoming 17-day sailing expedition organized by The Arctic Circle (<a href=""http://www.thearcticcircle.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.thearcticcircle.org</a>). Taking place from September 29 to October 16, 2011, the program invites artists, scientists, educators and architects to collectively explore a region of the Arctic and respond to this experience in their work. As I develop the story, the expedition will give me the opportunity to deepen my knowledge of the region, immerse myself in a maritime Arctic environment, and have access to artists who have similar interests and might become collaborators. It will also provide an intensely focused period of time to concentrate on this new play and learn about the people and geography of the Norwegian Arctic.</div>
<p> </p>
<div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The cost for participation in The Arctic Circle program is $5,800 with an equal amount subsidized by The Farm, Inc., the not-for-profit organization that administers the expedition program, plus airfare. I was awarded a $5000 Jerome Foundation Travel &amp; Study Grant which pretty much covers my expedition costs. I am now looking to raise $1,500 to pay for roundtrip airfare between New York and Longyearbyen, Svalbard, our port of departure. </p>
<p>Your donation is tax-deductible. And depending on the level at which you give, you will receive various tokens of appreciation in return. (My own special way of saying thank you!) I also hope you'll get pleasure from knowing you are participating in a special project and supporting a worthy cause.</p>

 to the estate of Bly, where thereâ€™s no shortage of secrets and no 
escape from desires. This new dance-theatre adaptation of Henry Jamesâ€™ Turn of the Screw
 asks: which do you like more, watching or being watched? Will you give 
in to what you want most, or deny it until it ruins you? And, most 
importantly, have you been bad?  We hope so.

Seventeenth is a new, student-written work produced by students at Emerson College (Boston, MA), and set to premiere at the Boston Center for the Arts on March 26th, 2015.  The story, written by junior Writing for Film and Television major Mechi Lakatos, delves headfirst into the taboo subject of sexual abuse with a rawness, honesty, and strength that is rare for a first work.  The story revolves around a seventeen-year-old girl named K who has just returned home after being sent away to protect her family's image after word gets out of her father's sexual abuse.  K is forced to dive back into the high pressures of her senior year, all the while still grappling and struggling to come to terms with the aftermath of the intense trauma that has left her altogether voiceless.The show follows a gang of wayward teenagers as they navigate relationships, abuse, and recovery within the decadence and dysthymia of Southern California.  Around K, her best friend, Lily, is hyperanxiously awaiting her decision from Brown.  Her quasi-ex-boyfriend, Nat, is (not) dealing with a family crisis.  And K's younger sister Joey, is just beginning to enter into all of it, and entering into the horrors of K's past.  Seventeenth is a snapshot of those teetering moments on the threshold of adulthood, and an exploration of how loud your own voice can really be, if you learn to really speak up.The cast and production team of Seventeenth are made up entirely of students.  We are interested in using this piece as a platform to begin conversations on campus and break down the taboos that make victims of abuse afraid to speak out.Your financial contribution will help fundThe main reason we need financial support is to pay for our space rental - a $1000 investment.  We have already secured space and made a security deposit and down payment on a theatre at the Boston Center for the Arts, with show dates planned for March 26-28th.  We have had to search for outside space although we are part of a college because we have been met with so many closed doors when seeking space and support at Emerson as an independent production.  We hope to see changes to this climate, but in the meantime, we are really needing this support so this show can see the stage and this important conversation about sexual assault and abuse can persist and be looked at in new and important ways within the Emerson community and the Boston community as a whole.Contributions will also help fund our intricate multimedia set, costumes, props, and set pieces.  They will allow us to design and print programs, posters, and other advertising, which is important to us because we want to get the word out to as many people as possible.  Although this is a small show, it has a big message, and we want it to reach as many people as it can.We are aiming to do all we want to do on the smallest budget possible, and pulling a lot of strings in order to make it all happen, but even a small amount of funding will really help to create the world of Seventeenth more colorfully and more wholly, and certainly impact the impression that the show will therefore leave on its audience after the curtain falls.Any funds raised beyond our goal will be donated to the Boston Area Rape Crisis Center to benefit victims of sexual assault in the Boston area.Why this show?This show is especially important because the voices that get to speak through the words of this show and the messages that are opened up for dialogue and discourse are ones that are often silenced.

<div>
<p>Kilusan’s work has always been rooted in servicing the needs of the larger community and empowering youth throughout the country. It’s the community that helped fund a successful fundraising campaign back in 2012 to bring the Universal Self Production to the Sahabhaga: Festival of Participatory Performance in Bagalore, India. Since then, numerous performances of Universal Self have brought together thousands of people from various ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds into one space to build cross cultural unity &amp; empowerment. Kilusan is appealing to the community once again to help fund the production of Universal Self to the FringeNYC Festival stage and to bring to light his story onto a national stage. Your contributions matter because individuals like you are making a powerful statement with their dollars that reinforces innovation &amp; originality in the performance arts.  Universal Self is valuable to the world because it is a story about healing from personal experiences, while simultaneously celebrating a multicultural reality in the 21st century.</p>

-Daniel Gallant, Executive Director of the Nuyorican Poets Cafe, NY
 
“I'm honored that Kilusan Bautista performed an excerpt from his solo show Universal Filipino in his San Quentin State Prison class. The students were moved by a story that resonated so well with their own struggles. And we had another great discussion on masculinity, in relation to Frank Chin’s “Chickencoop Chinaman,” that preceded and connected with Kilusan’s performance.”
-Terry Park, Prison University Project

<p>The Tampa Repertory Theatre, recently named<a href=""http://m.cltampa.com/tampa/BestOf?oid=3414126"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""> Best of the Bay New Theatre Company</a> by <em>Creative Loafing,</em> and Hat Trick Theatre Productions, in their first season back in Tampa, are teaming up to bring <em>Hamlet</em> to the Studio Theatre at HCC Ybor City. </p>
<p>Directed by C. David Frankel, TampaRep's artistic director, and starring Jack Holloway, Hat Trick's artistic director, <em>Hamlet</em> is part detective story, part psychological profile, part swashbuckler, part romance, and part comedy. The play mixes genres as rapidly as Hamlet switches moods.</p>
<p>Although it’s one of the most famous plays of all time, <em>Hamlet</em> still can surprise; it's an exciting story that twists and turns, and veers from the sublime to the comic and back again -- and it's been a dream for both theatres to put it on stage.</p>
<p>Now, we're doing so -- but we could use your help.  If you're in the Tampa area, we'd love to have you in the audience:</p>
<p><em>Hamlet</em> opens April 25, 2013 and runs through May 12. You can get all the production information and also purchase tickets on our website: <a href=""http://www.tamparep.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.tamparep.org</a>.</p>
<p>Whether you can come or not, though, you can still help us out, and get one of our great perks, by donating to the production.  Your support will help us pay the artists -- some of Tampa's best actors and designers, something closer to what they deserve.  Everything we earn goes into the production, and beyond the actors there's rent, scenic and costume material, advertising -- all those things that a theatre company needs to do.</p>
<p><em><span lang=""EN-CA"">Hamlet</span></em><span lang=""EN-CA""> brings TampaRep's second mainstage season to a close, following the company’s critically acclaimed production of <em><a href=""http://www.tampabay.com/things-to-do/stage/strong-cast-brightens-tampa-repertory-theatres-the-glass-menagerie/1271209"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Glass Menagerie</a> </em>in January.  Hat Trick turns its attention to<em> Neville's Island </em>to close out their season. Then it's on to next year, and another season of bringing great plays to great audiences -- with, we hope, your great support.</span></p>

To accomplish this mission we serve to help initiate charcter education programs in public and private schools and provide in-depth training towards developing and equipping fully functional mime crews.</p>
<p>EPPIC Ministries is a unique organization with a specific focus. The organization exists to bring to the field a visible, easy to use tool that bridges age, language and cultural barriers. This tool is used in two main venues; schools and churches.  In schools we use original charcter education sketch material specifically developed for use in public and private schools to help initiate and support character education programs.  In churches we use what we generically refer to as ""The Gospel in Mime"".  “The Gospel in Mime” is a repetoire of over 60 Biblical sketches that are used to produce programs of various lengths from 15 to 90 minutes.  These programs are used effectively all over the world, captivating the imagination of all age groups.</p>
<p>Today we need your help in the first step towards developing a Ukrainian national mime crew.  The two week tour we are raising funds for will positively impact thousands of Ukrainians and serve as the beginning of a two year process to establish a team like EPPIC's in the Ukraine.</p>
<p>As an incentive to help, we are offering you, the donor, some perks.</p>

To accomplish this mission we serve to help initiate charcter education programs in public and private schools and provide in-depth training towards developing and equipping fully functional mime crews.
EPPIC Ministries is a unique organization with a specific focus. The organization exists to bring to the field a visible, easy to use tool that bridges age, language and cultural barriers. This tool is used in two main venues; schools and churches.  In schools we use original charcter education sketch material specifically developed for use in public and private schools to help initiate and support character education programs.  In churches we use what we generically refer to as ""The Gospel in Mime"".  “The Gospel in Mime” is a repetoire of over 60 Biblical sketches that are used to produce programs of various lengths from 15 to 90 minutes.  These programs are used effectively all over the world, captivating the imagination of all age groups.
Today we need your help in the first step towards developing a Ukrainian national mime crew.  The two week tour we are raising funds for will positively impact thousands of Ukrainians and serve as the beginning of a two year process to establish a team like EPPIC's in the Ukraine.
As an incentive to help, we are offering you, the donor, some perks.
And if you can't give at this time, please, please, pass this on to those in your sphere of influence. Use the tools at this site to help you with that.  We would greatly appreciate it!

<em>Only Heaven Knows How Glory Goes, What Each Of Us Was Meant </em><em>To Be. In The Starlight, That is What We Are. I Can See So Far.</em>
</h3>
<p>That is a quote from the show Floyd Collins that I had the privledge of playing Floyd in. As an actor, I truly understand this line, in that I don't know where my journey will take me, but I know its the only path I could ever be on.</p>
<p>Hello, my name is Jonathan Elliott <span class=""J-JK9eJ-PJVNOc"">Coarsey</span>, and I am an Actor. I have been all my life, and hope to keep performing until the day I die. I have been traveling around for the last four years working at every theater that would give me a job. Luckily for me, a lot of them gave me jobs. Now my travels have found me in the city of Philadelphia. I am working towards becoming an Equity Actor so that I can acheive my lifelong dream of working on Broadway. (Watch the video above to get to know a little more about me)</p>

That is a quote from the show Floyd Collins that I had the privledge of playing Floyd in. As an actor, I truly understand this line, in that I don't know where my journey will take me, but I know its the only path I could ever be on.
Hello, my name is Jonathan Elliott Coarsey, and I am an Actor. I have been all my life, and hope to keep performing until the day I die. I have been traveling around for the last four years working at every theater that would give me a job. Luckily for me, a lot of them gave me jobs. Now my travels have found me in the city of Philadelphia. I am working towards becoming an Equity Actor so that I can acheive my lifelong dream of working on Broadway.

<p>""Driveway Follies"" is a professionally staged Halloween marionette show performed each year in an Oakland driveway and is accompanied by an outstanding scary yard haunt.  The locally recognized shows are enjoyed by over 1,000 Halloween revelers annually.  From its start in 2007, response has been enthusiastic.  Now all seats are filled and audiences overflow into the closed-off street. <br/><br/>The show includes dozens of elaborate and intricate figures, backdrops, props, period music and sets – all built by hand by Driveway Follies artists. Director Larry Schmidt often adds new sequences so each year Driveway Follies presents a unique never-seen-before show comprised of vignettes about our now beloved characters. Beginning in 2007 with three puppeteers performing three acts, the show has grown to five acts performed eight times a night for three nights by seven puppeteers. The acts each depict a unique aspect of Halloween - sometimes having an educational twist.</p>
<h2>Sustaining a Lost Art</h2>
<p>In a time of computer generated entertainment, Driveway Follies offers a rare opportunity to see the nearly lost art of puppets and marionettes in an intimate setting. Because of his commitment to proving free performances to the community, Director Larry Schmidt has self funded the shows since inception.  However growth has resulted in increased production and safety costs and has prompted us to think about sustainability.  Seeing increasing costs and fearful that he can no longer support them alone, the Director decided to reach out to the community for help.  </p>
<p>We asked Fractured Atlas to serve as our fiscal sponsor which allows us to accept tax- deductible donations.  In addition to local support we are using crowd- funding and seeking grant funding to keep the show available and free to the public.  So this year, we are both fund-raising and friend-raising.  We are asking you to become a Friend of Driveway Follies through your contributions, and to stay in touch with us in years to come.   </p>

<p>“I don’t feel like I’m using Halloween to express my individuality; I feel like Halloween uses me to express itself”, Director Larry Schmidt.</p>
<p>Larry founded Driveway Follies and has been its creative force since the beginning.  Driveway owner and master puppeteer, he grew up in Oakland in a time when there was a lot of trick-or-treating and he made his first yard haunt as a child. As an adult, Larry noticed that the neighborhood celebrations of Halloween were disappearing.  People weren't putting out jack-o-lanterns, or trick-or-treating like they used to.  Larry views Halloween as a wholesome, inter-generational, neighborhood activity.  Driveway Follies is an alternative to the gore and commercialism that is part of many modern Halloween attractions.</p>
<p>Larry received a Bachelor of Fine Arts at California College of Arts and Crafts.  He was introduced to puppets by his grandmother and it has been a lifelong hobby.  He has created costumes for the Oakland Ballet and has mentored budding puppeteers.  </p>
<h2>Driveway Follies Future Magic</h2>
<p>Larry and his crew are currently working on a new show based on a traditional Irish legend of the origins of the Jack-o-Lantern.  The new show will add to the over half dozen sequences.  Please join us in support for this year’s show and future Driveway Follies Future magic.  </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
The Awake and Alive Project is a series of monologues and scenes written by and about real people who are affected or infected with HIV. Sad, funny, and poingant, Awake and Alive really brings to light the stories and lives of those infected.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>A&amp;A is a project to raise awareness for HIV/AIDS through theatre and other means through college campuses across the world.  Our mission is to raise awarness and money( to go to the AIDS Institute) to find a cure for the virus, and talk about how to protect yourself.</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In July of 2012, I(Emerald) started to write a play based on the experiences people have had surrounding the virus HIV/AIDS. The first production of that play, Awake and Alive, will be in December, in Bethany, West Virginia. We have two wonderful directors and a flurry of actors willing to spend the time and energy needed to originate a role.</p>
<p>But here's the thing, the Awake and Alive Project (A&amp;A) is bigger than a small town in West Virginia. The Awake and Alive Project is about sharing life experiences, and moving people to become aware in their communities. We want A&amp;A to become something that's shown on college campuses all over the world- because my generation has the highest rate of infection- because my generation perpetuates this disease- and it's time to do something about it. Our hope is to become a non-profit organization dedicated to first of all hearing the stories of victims who are HIV+ and their families, and second of all offering communities and colleges the chance to make a difference in their community- customized to be what their campus hears the loudest.

We're trying to raise $1000 for the Awake and Alive Project, to cover the cost of  starting the process of becoming a non profit organization, to build a website, to cover outreach cost to other people affected by AIDS who want to share their stories and to reach out to colleges and campuses across the globe to tell these stories and end AIDS.</div>

</div></div>","Short Summary
The Awake and Alive Project is a series of monologues and scenes written by and about real people who are affected or infected with HIV. Sad, funny, and poingant, Awake and Alive really brings to light the stories and lives of those infected.
 
A&A is a project to raise awareness for HIV/AIDS through theatre and other means through college campuses across the world.  Our mission is to raise awarness and money( to go to the AIDS Institute) to find a cure for the virus, and talk about how to protect yourself.

What We Need & What You Get
In July of 2012, I(Emerald) started to write a play based on the experiences people have had surrounding the virus HIV/AIDS. The first production of that play, Awake and Alive, will be in December, in Bethany, West Virginia. We have two wonderful directors and a flurry of actors willing to spend the time and energy needed to originate a role.
But here's the thing, the Awake and Alive Project (A&A) is bigger than a small town in West Virginia. The Awake and Alive Project is about sharing life experiences, and moving people to become aware in their communities. We want A&A to become something that's shown on college campuses all over the world- because my generation has the highest rate of infection- because my generation perpetuates this disease- and it's time to do something about it. Our hope is to become a non-profit organization dedicated to first of all hearing the stories of victims who are HIV+ and their families, and second of all offering communities and colleges the chance to make a difference in their community- customized to be what their campus hears the loudest. Eventually, we want so many stories coming into our fold that each campus can choose which pieces they would like on campus, with a certain number required in each production.
We're trying to raise $1000 for the Awake and Alive Project, to cover the cost of  starting the process of becoming a non profit organization, to build a website, to cover outreach cost to other people affected by AIDS who want to share their stories and to reach out to colleges and campuses across the globe to tell these stories and end AIDS.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Tera Zarra has been a valued contributor to the West Coast performing scene for years, as a musician, actor, acrobat, and coach and teacher. She recently found out that she has a rotator cuff tear which prevents her from doing acrobatics or aerial, which is her livelihood!  </p>
<p>She has contributed greatly to this communty through her art, her performance and teaching.  She has also volunteered performances and services for a variety of benefit events and even coordinated an entire benefit performance when acrobatics coach Stefan Furst had a similar medical disaster.  It's our turn to help her out!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p> - The MRI alone cost $1300, and that's just for the diagnosis...</p>
<p> - From here, she will receive PRP injections which cost between $500-$1000 per injection!  It's not yet clear how many Tera will need.</p>
<p>Tera doesn't have medical insurance, and is paying for all of this out-of-pocket, which is made increasingly challenging as the injury prevents her from doing her work!  Any little bit helps!</p>

</div></div>","Our Story 
The idea behind our company is to create a cultural bridge between Spain and the United States by having Spanish and Hispanic artists in New York collaborate, using Spanish as a meeting ground.  The “La Strada” project is the first step in this collaboration, to promote a cultural and artistic exchange between the two countries, strengthening, on the one hand, the Spanish language’s place in the artistic scene of the United States, and on the other, creating opportunities to enrich the artistic scenes of both countries.
Impact 
This project is unique because it means a first step towards enriching the cultural exchange between the communities of Spanish-speaking artists in the United States and the artistic community in Spain.  This is only the beginning of many more similarly-aimed projects! 
 
What We Need and What You Receive 
As the first step in this endeavor, La Strada Company, together with the acclaimed IATI Theater, has chosen to produce the stage adaptation of Federico Fellini’s famous movie “La Strada” in Spanish. 
This production will open towards the end of February-March 2011 in New York City, under the direction of the celebrated René Buch (Artistic Director of Repertorio Español), and with the collaboration of another great director, Jorge Merced (Artistic Director of Pregones Theatre). The production will be presented at the IATI Theatre—an essential reference point for Spanish language theatre in New York.
The play will be performed by the members of La Strada Company (Spanish actors Irene Aguilar, Israel Ruiz and Luis Carlos de La Lombana).  We are planning a subsequent tour to Washington D.C. and Miami in 2011.  After that, we have been invited to take our production to Spain and Italy in the summer of this same year.
The chance to bring to the stage a work by a film genius is not an opportunity that comes every day. Nor is it a simple task.  La Strada is a universal work that tackles current problems, such as violence and abuse, as well as showing the “Fellini-esque” universe.  We aim to bring the richness of this work to the stage and provide another platform to reflect on these still current themes. 
 But to make this a reality, we need your help!
  
We want to pay Fellini the tribute he deserves with a production that is as fully realized as possible.  We have been working on this project with great hopes for almost two years, and know that it will be reflected in our work onstage.  Thus, we are confident of success!
Together with the funds raised so far, to complete the financing phase of the production we need to come up with an additional $20,000.  And your collaboration will be crucial for the project to move forward. 
On this first online fundraising campaign, our goal is to raise $5,000 by February 1, 2011. We count on your help!

</div></div>","For the past year and a half, long-time musical collaborators Lucas Papaelias (a.k.a. LPfunK) and Deborah C. Smith have been
creating a new rock musical called Pyramidica: Songs of Freedom.  This Summer, we have been invited to take Pyramidica to the New Writers. New Plays. Festival on Martha's Vineyard. As writers, this month-long artist-residency, culminating in 3 public readings, is a dream coming true. In order to continue on this journey we've started, we need your financial support. 



 

THE MUSICAL

Pyramidica: Songs of Freedom is an
ironic, humorous, and fast-paced rock musical featuring
an original score of hard-hitting, melodic tunes, with a throbbing pulse
and infectious hooks, that takes its audience on a
exploration of the power of the pyramid scheme’s role in the pursuit of the
new American Dream:  to achieve
success, and ultimately, freedom, by working “Smarter, Not Harder.”
Pyramidica 
takes place at the ""free"" orientation for
a pyramid-scheme company, called ""Pyramidica"", which has created an 
algorithm that
can quantify freedom.  Company members and clients use the algorithm to make choices in their 
lives based on the calculated amount of ""Freedom"" their actions will 
produce.  We follow several characters at various levels of the pyramid scheme on their individual journeys to discover their Freedom.  

The
moral of our story is that Freedom, in any form, cannot be obtained without
some sort of a compromise.  Once we can figure out what it is that makes us feel free, and can learn to compromise along the way, we will be better prepared to make our own choices and find balance and meaning in our daily
existence.  

THE FESTIVAL

New Writers. New Plays. is an annual festival of new works by emerging playwrights. Hosted by Vineyard Arts Project and Art Farm, and situated in the gorgeous setting of Edgartown on Martha's Vineyard, the 
playwrights, directors, and actors team up for the first time to focus on the creation of the new play or musical.  The 
month-long residency culminates with a three-day festival of public 
readings. 

THE CAST

We are thrilled to be collaborating on the script and songs with
a cast of incredibly talented professional theater artists, all with 
extensive Broadway and Off-Broadway credits, including Jenni Barber, Damon Daunno, Erica Nadera, Flaco Navaja, Kevin Mambo, Anne Nathan, Matthew White, our Music Director John Pratt and Director Lou Moreno.  

Through this workshop, we will prepare Pyramidica for the next phase of development:  a presentation in New York

for another workshop and/or a production at an Off-Broadway or regional

<div class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 10pt; margin-left: 0in;""><font size=""3""><font>In 1838, Edgar Allan Poe began a journey with a short story about the beautifully haunting Ligeia, and in 1845 he inserted a macabre verse about the tragedy of man using imagery of madness, sin, and human gore. This visionary act of romanticizing death would set forth an unstoppable path to the current resurrection of Poe's monster. In 2010 Jade Bartlett of the Wonderland Robbers and Elyssa Samsel (<span lang=""EN"" style=""color: black;"">BMI Lehman Engel Musical Theatre Workshop) </span><span>picked </span>up Edgar's quill and fulfilled his dark plans to walk the razor's edge of beauty and death... More accurately while chugging from a bottle of absinthe, they ripped the quill from his cold dead hand and kicked him in the face. Written in booze and blood the new musical <i>Ligeia</i> is a combination of classically influenced music and a gothically charged ghost story.</font></font></div>
<div class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 10pt; margin-left: 0in;""><font size=""3""><font>2011 in NYC, we arrive ready to bring you into our Dark Education. On March 14<sup>th</sup> it is time to draw back the curtain and arrange a glimpse into our world of obsession, beauty, addiction, and ultimately death. At the Metropolitan Room in concert form with 6 incredibly talented performers, we will conjure a new genre in musical theater, the horror musical. Forget what you know about the Sweeney guy, the music of the night, or that cute little plant that talks and sings. We take the next step in a journey that began 163 years ago, a journey to make you fall in love with evil, a journey to embrace the darker words. <span> </span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></font></font></div>

<div class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 10pt; margin-left: 0in;""><font size=""3""><font>Tired of pretty musicals with bright lights and happy endings? How about ironic musicals where each line is just an attempt to be cleverer than the next, or possibly sick of everything being a rock musical? Yeah I'm not sick of those musicals either. In fact I love musicals of all kinds, but man I am ready for a change! I also love horror movies; more accurately I love a good ghost story where suspension of disbelief is just as crucial as when everyone in a musical happens to know the same song and dance routine. We aren't trying to save the world, hell we aren't even trying to save musical theater. <span> </span>We just want to open up the playing field for all forms of storytelling. A new audience is queuing outside the latest horror movie just waiting to be moved by a new form of visceral entertainment.

In 1838, Edgar Allan Poe began a journey with a short story about the beautifully haunting Ligeia, and in 1845 he inserted a macabre verse about the tragedy of man using imagery of madness, sin, and human gore. This visionary act of romanticizing death would set forth an unstoppable path to the current resurrection of Poe's monster. In 2010 Jade Bartlett of the Wonderland Robbers and Elyssa Samsel (BMI Lehman Engel Musical Theatre Workshop) picked up Edgar's quill and fulfilled his dark plans to walk the razor's edge of beauty and death... More accurately while chugging from a bottle of absinthe, they ripped the quill from his cold dead hand and kicked him in the face. Written in booze and blood the new musical Ligeia is a combination of classically influenced music and a gothically charged ghost story.
2011 in NYC, we arrive ready to bring you into our Dark Education. On March 14th it is time to draw back the curtain and arrange a glimpse into our world of obsession, beauty, addiction, and ultimately death. At the Metropolitan Room in concert form with 6 incredibly talented performers, we will conjure a new genre in musical theater, the horror musical. Forget what you know about the Sweeney guy, the music of the night, or that cute little plant that talks and sings. We take the next step in a journey that began 163 years ago, a journey to make you fall in love with evil, a journey to embrace the darker words.     
The Impact
Tired of pretty musicals with bright lights and happy endings? How about ironic musicals where each line is just an attempt to be cleverer than the next, or possibly sick of everything being a rock musical? Yeah I'm not sick of those musicals either. In fact I love musicals of all kinds, but man I am ready for a change! I also love horror movies; more accurately I love a good ghost story where suspension of disbelief is just as crucial as when everyone in a musical happens to know the same song and dance routine. We aren't trying to save the world, hell we aren't even trying to save musical theater.  We just want to open up the playing field for all forms of storytelling. A new audience is queuing outside the latest horror movie just waiting to be moved by a new form of visceral entertainment. Moved by a world where the ghost is not safe on the screen, but lurking in the room. So real you could almost touch it or it could touch you. They want more than rock operas, jukebox musicals, movie adaptations, and mocking comedies. They want to take a risk.
You can always remain in the safe worlds you are used to, where musicals are only about pretty people singing pretty songs prettily, where movie monsters obey the rules of cinema and are only allowed to walk among us while the camera is rolling. Or you could follow us and dare to be haunted. Open your world to the possibilities that the monster behind the door is real and you helped to create it.

<h2>HOW IT ALL BEGAN ... </h2>
<p>The Santa Monica Pier Corporation has joined forces with Tony Award winning actor/director Paul Sand (that's me) to present live theater on The Santa Monica Pier, appropriately named:</p>
<h3>THE WEST END THEATER</h3>
<p>That’s about as far west as you can get in L.A. This is how it happened. </p>
<p>I was taking a walk on the pier with a couple of friends one night and I suddenly thought... Wouldn’t this pier be a perfect place to have live theater and present a vivid production of KURT WEILL’S dark, theatrical waterfront songs all about revenge, murder and broken hearts? The next day I contacted Jim Harris, Deputy Director of the pier, and pitched him the idea. He smiled and said, “Okay, we’ve been wanting to add live theater to the pier, and I happen to have an available space at the far west end. It hangs out over the ocean and gets pretty wild up there sometimes... would that suit you?” “You bet it would!” said I. Jim wound up the conversation with, ""What do you think of calling it The West End Theater?"" I could think of nothing better.</p>
<p>I then tracked down a few beautiful, powerful and intense actors, who can also sing, which I had placed in my… “remember that talent” part of my brain. Happily they all agreed to play. I called my friend Carol Sills, wife and widow of the legendary director Paul Sills who created Second City and Story Theater. Paul and I had worked closely together my entire adult life. Carol Sills found Michael Roth, the musical director, who happens to be a Kurt Weill expert living right here in Santa Monica (!) a block away from Bertolt Brecht’s old house on 26th street (!!). Roth accepted (turns out the guy is brilliant). So did Marie Lalanne, the extraordinary surrealist painter, who came aboard to design costumes and sets, creating the murals on huge canvas panels in keeping with the carnival atmosphere of the pier. The entire company was formed in two weeks. </p>
<p>We are calling it.  </p>

<h2><strong>We Reached our Goal, but We Still Need Your Help!</strong></h2>
<p><strong>The Artistic Home's</strong> production of <strong><em>The American Plan</em> </strong>is set to open July 22, 2012. </p>
<p>Thanks to you we not only closed the gap on the funds to pay our performers, we also managed to do the same for our designers and technical staff! </p>
<p><strong>But it's not too late to help!  Send us a message to learn how your futher contribution can help us get all the technical elements in place. </strong> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>The Play</strong></h2>
<p>Set against the backdrop of the Catskills during a 1960s summer, <strong>The American Plan</strong> tells a brutally funny, heart-rending tale of love and loss. American playwright <strong>Richard Greenberg</strong> (winner of the 2003 Tony Award for best new play for Take Me Out) brings us into the lives a Lili and Eva Adler, a mother and daughter living lives on the fringes of the fabulous Jewish society families frolicking across the lake. A darkly brilliant young woman, forever waiting for her white knight. A mother, unwilling to relinquish her hold on her beautiful, damaged daughter. Both of them forever bound by the twisted mother-daughter bonds of love and hate. When Lili’s white knight actually appears in the form of Nick Lockridge, complete with secrets of his own, three lives are forever altered. </p>
<h2><strong>The Team</strong></h2>
<p>The American Plan makes us take a long hard look at the price we pay for love, for personal happiness and what lengths we are willing to go for those we love.</p>
<p>At the helm will be acclaimed Chicago <strong>director Robin Witt</strong>, recently nominated for a 2011 Jeff Award for best direction for the play Stage Door.</p>
<p><strong>Playing the lead role of Eva Adler is Artistic Home Artistic Director Kathy Scambiatterra</strong>, returning to the AH stage on the heels of an appearance as Amanda Wingfield in Steppenwolf's NEXT UP production of Tennessee William's <em>The Glass Menagerie</em>. Her most recent role in an Artistic Home production in the long-running, critically-acclaimed <em>Sweet Bird of Youth</em> earned her a Jeff Award nomination for Principal Actress in a Play.</p>
<p>Joining Robin and Kathy are Artistic Home ensemble members <strong>Nick Horst</strong> (<em>The Tallest Man, Skin of Our Teeth, and Look Homeward, Angel</em>) in the role of Nick Lockridge and <strong>Tim Musachio</strong> (<em>Sweet Bird of Youth, How To Act Around Cops</em>) in the role of Paul. They will be joined by guest artists <strong>Margaret Katch</strong> (Lili Adler) and <strong>Tonya Simmons</strong> (Olivia).</p>
<p><strong>Michael Mroch (Scenic Design)</strong> designed our productions of <em>House of Yes</em>, <em>The Tallest Man</em>, <em>Sweet Bird of Youth</em>, and <em>Tea and Sympathy</em>) since graduating from Columbia College with a BFA in Directing and Scenic Design. Other recent design credits include <em>The Sea</em> with Theatre Mir @ Theatre Wit, <em>They Are Dying Out</em> and <em>The Word Progress on my Mother’s Lips</em> at Trap Door Theatre, <em>Ironmistress</em> with Oracle, <em>Old Times</em> with Strawdog, and <em>Brand</em> with Red Tape.</p>
<p><strong>Emily McConnell</strong> <strong>(Costume Designer)</strong> is new to The Artistic Home, though she is company costume designer for O’Malley Theatre Productions and Head Costume Designer for the National High School Institute.

The Artistic Home's production of The American Plan is set to open July 22, 2012. 
Thanks to you we not only closed the gap on the funds to pay our performers, we also managed to do the same for our designers and technical staff! 
But it's not too late to help!  Send us a message to learn how your futher contribution can help us get all the technical elements in place.  
 
The Play
Set against the backdrop of the Catskills during a 1960s summer, The American Plan tells a brutally funny, heart-rending tale of love and loss. American playwright Richard Greenberg (winner of the 2003 Tony Award for best new play for Take Me Out) brings us into the lives a Lili and Eva Adler, a mother and daughter living lives on the fringes of the fabulous Jewish society families frolicking across the lake. A darkly brilliant young woman, forever waiting for her white knight. A mother, unwilling to relinquish her hold on her beautiful, damaged daughter. Both of them forever bound by the twisted mother-daughter bonds of love and hate. When Lili’s white knight actually appears in the form of Nick Lockridge, complete with secrets of his own, three lives are forever altered. 
The Team
The American Plan makes us take a long hard look at the price we pay for love, for personal happiness and what lengths we are willing to go for those we love.
At the helm will be acclaimed Chicago director Robin Witt, recently nominated for a 2011 Jeff Award for best direction for the play Stage Door.
Playing the lead role of Eva Adler is Artistic Home Artistic Director Kathy Scambiatterra, returning to the AH stage on the heels of an appearance as Amanda Wingfield in Steppenwolf's NEXT UP production of Tennessee William's The Glass Menagerie. Her most recent role in an Artistic Home production in the long-running, critically-acclaimed Sweet Bird of Youth earned her a Jeff Award nomination for Principal Actress in a Play.
Joining Robin and Kathy are Artistic Home ensemble members Nick Horst (The Tallest Man, Skin of Our Teeth, and Look Homeward, Angel) in the role of Nick Lockridge and Tim Musachio (Sweet Bird of Youth, How To Act Around Cops) in the role of Paul. They will be joined by guest artists Margaret Katch (Lili Adler) and Tonya Simmons (Olivia).
Michael Mroch (Scenic Design) designed our productions of House of Yes, The Tallest Man, Sweet Bird of Youth, and Tea and Sympathy) since graduating from Columbia College with a BFA in Directing and Scenic Design. Other recent design credits include The Sea with Theatre Mir @ Theatre Wit, They Are Dying Out and The Word Progress on my Mother’s Lips at Trap Door Theatre, Ironmistress with Oracle, Old Times with Strawdog, and Brand with Red Tape.
Emily McConnell (Costume Designer) is new to The Artistic Home, though she is company costume designer for O’Malley Theatre Productions and Head Costume Designer for the National High School Institute. She has worked in Chicago with Steep Theatre, Gift Theatre, Griffin Theatre, Theatre Mir, American Theatre Company, Remy Bumppo, About Face, and others since receiving her M.F.A. in Costume and Set Design from Northwestern University. 
Garvin Jellison (Lighting Designer) designed our productions of Marisol and Tea and Sympathy.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi I'm Simon Woodcock. i'm an aspiring actor from Bradford, West Yorkshire. </p>
<p>Let me tell you a bit about myself. I've been performing since a very young age- primary school plays set off a love that continued through high school, doing various theatre projects including becoming a member of the National outside of school before going to university. Whilst at university I performed in a number of plays with the recently formed theatre society there and helped to grow the society and its reputation. Since then I've been working in retail whilst really, really missing the stage and performing. Desperately keen to get into the industry with very little money and no real connection into the industry I knew it was time to apply for training. Researching the options online I discovered the work of Fourth Monkey. It offers innovative actor training for young people based around forming a repertory theatre company in the second year of the course; with my experience at university there was a real Rep feel that I wanted to build on in a more professional atmosphere.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So I applied and after a couple of auditions, I got accepted!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The course looks amazing (details here: <a href=""http://www.fourthmonkey.co.uk/content/twoyearrep"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.fourthmonkey.co.uk/content/twoyearrep</a>.) and I've been in contact with others who have been accepted and all of us are massively excited about it. Actor training of this calibre is not cheap. Over the course of two years the fees add up to £15900 and that's without the living costs of London. I am committed to making my acting dream a reality and this training will really enable me to do this.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Moving from a northern city like Bradford to somewhere like London is a huge move but its something I'm really ready for. Now I have a place, I'm ready and raring to go but I need help to pay for it. I'm on indiegogo to hopefully find people willing to help!</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>How it Breaks Down:</h3>
<p>The course costs are as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Year One</strong></p>
<p>£700 non-refundable deposit payable on acceptance of place</p>
<p>£2500 payable by 1<sup>st</sup> September 2012</p>
<p>£2500 payable by 5<sup>th</sup> January 2013</p>
<p>£2250 payable by 5<sup>th</sup> April 2013</p>
<p>Total: £7950</p>
<p><strong>Year Two </strong></p>
<p>£3000 payable by 1<sup>st</sup> September 2013</p>
<p>£2500 payable by 5<sup>th</sup> January 2014</p>
<p>£2450 payable by 5<sup>th</sup> April 2014</p>
<p>Total: £7950</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I've set a target on here of £5500 (accounting for indiegogo's fees).</p>
<p>If raised this money will pay for my first and second terms at Fourth Monkey. Obviously this is not where the fundraising ends. I'm selling things on ebay and trying to attract funding from a variety of other sources locally and nationally. I will be continuing to raise money throughout my time training.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Remember, if just 100 people gave £25 each I could pay for one term outright. Even the smallest amount could really make the difference for me.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>So What's in it for you?</h3>
<p>The chance to be an integral part of a young performers early career? :D</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Realistically there is not loads I can do in return for your kindness. What I can do though, I will put in every effort to do!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I pledge to send you a personalised letter of thanks for your contribution. And let me tell you in advance how truly thankful I am for any contribution you can offer! As often as possible I will keep you up to date on my progress and training and wherever possible I will notify you in advance of any forthcoming performances and offer complimentary tickets where available.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Also, if you do contribute and  think you can use my performing skills for anything; corporate videos, commercials, presenting or events I'd be more than happy to oblige wherever I can. And if there's anything else I can offer to help with- if you want a labourer, gardener whatever... I 'll try to help!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Lastly, I promise your contribution will not be wasted. If I can sort out the course fees through fundraising life will be slightly easier whilst I'm there and I will be able to work in order to pay for living costs whilst ever-continuing to fundraise more and more. I'm serious and commited to working in this industry and determined to succeed so despite the actors reputation for drinking I definitely won't be spending your contributions down the pub!</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Even if you can't offer financial support there are still other ways you can really contribute to my efforts. Maybe you know of a charity, an organisation or an individual that helps with cases like mine, or would be prepared to do so. Let me know, let them know. I'm trying everything I can but there will no doubt be funding source's I've overlooked or simply have no knowledge of. Every suggestion is gratefully received.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you can't contribute financially but have something you could donate to my other fundraising channels (unwanted goods I could sell, a platform I could use to get people talking/contributing etc), anything at all. Please do get in touch.</p>
<p> </p>

Whitman College Gender Studies Program as the opener for Washington D.C.-based dance/rock act Tia  Nina, who played The Gesa Power House Theatre in October.  The full production will include a team of five dancers, three actors, and a compact musical ensemble whose members will perform music composed especially for the project.  When this group of unique collaborators comes together at The Power House Theatre on April 26 to bring original dance theater to Walla Walla, you’ll want to be there!CONNECTIf you’d like to learn more, check out SuitCase Dances on Facebook, and see the artistic

<h2>70 Playwrights in one window? How are they gonna fit? (And are they neked?)</h2>
<p>Yeah! (well, kinda) Over 70 playwrights are gonna be writing Brand New Plays in the window of the Drama Book Shop in Times Square while the screen shot of their computer faces the street, making their process visible to the public.

<h3>That is Triple Xciting but why?</h3>
<p>Did you know that traditionally theater artists developed their skillZ with a capital Z in off-off Broadway theaters and performance spaces, many of which are now closed or closing due to the sucky economic environment?

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Hi, I am Nicole Roerick, Artistic Director of Nicole Roerick Collective based in Madison, WI. Ever since being involved in the arts, I have struggled to find a way in which to sustain my art making and to be able to reach a wider population. After completing my BFA and MFA in Dance, I am now continuing to create work and to bring it to as many people as I can. My passion for choreography and performance is something that I can not put into words, but I will try. Movement fills my body with emotion, discovery, awareness, and is my life. I want to share my creative visions with others and to draw them into my world and leave them feeling something they may not have felt before. I am extremely grateful for my dancers and think that is important that they receive money for all of their hard work and the time commitment involved. I am presenting one of my works, <i>Enfetter, </i>in New York city with myself and dancers Janelle Bentley and Emily Miller, and I need help with the costs!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>What: <i>Enfetter</i> performance</p>
<p>Where: WestFest Dance Festival at the Merce Cunningham Dance Studio in New York City </p>
<p>When: Dec. 8th and 10th, 2011</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I have always believed strongly in the arts and the ways in which artists have this ability to reach out to people. My work has the ability to reach people and draw emotions from them and will leave them thinking about the work and how it affected them. Presenting my own work in NYC is important for me so that I am able to bring it to a wider audience and get myself out there in the dance field. Not being able to cover the costs is something that I will always be trying to overcome as I continue to produce and present work locally and nationally, especially as funding for the arts continues to decrease in our country.</div>
<p><br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div>I need help in covering the plane tickets/luggage costs for myself and the dancers involved: $850</div>
<div>Performance and application fee for WestFest: $260</div>
<div>Rehearsal and Performance fees for myself and dancers: $600</div>
<div>Food, transportation etc. for myself and dancers to be in NYC for 4 days: $500</div>
<div>Costumes: $150</div>
<div>Documentation fees: $100</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I am also reaching out to my friends and family to help support the Nicole Roerick Collective for this particular performance and other projects along the way. Any amount that I receive will go towards any of the costs listed above and also other costs that are included in starting and running my own company. I also plan on producing a show in Madison, WI in the spring of 2012 and will be creating another campaign in the near future, so any additional funds over my goal will go towards the costs of this production.</div>
<p><br/></p>
<p>This of course is just an estimated budget, and the costs for dance artists in the U.S. are always something looming over our heads. Please help in any way that you can and support artists in need!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>By donating money, you will not only be helping me to fulfill my dreams and aspirations, but you will also be giving art the ability to reach people in so many ways. I will include your name on my facebook page and my blog and keep you updated on my future projects as the newsletter is created. I am also willing to offer one and one conversations about myself or my work, private Yoga instruction (I am 200 hour certified), informal showings of my work, and dinner at my home!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Haste are a brand spanking new all female international theatre company fresh out of their training on St Mary's Physical Theatre course. Our varied and strong creative backgrounds make us open to experimentation with forms old and new, resulting in a vibrant theatrical mix.</p>
<p>We look for the moments that make you laugh and cry at the same time, we are fascinated with stories that can reflect something of reality back to the audience and we make sure you have a lot of fun in the meantime.</p>
<p>Oyster Boy will be our third show together, touring throughout the UK and internationally in the summer of 2013. We have already been invited to perform at San Diego , Rome and Camden Fringe Festivals and schools across London, with plans for Germany and Scotland all in the mix.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are super excited to travel to pastures new and share our work with as many different people from as many different walks of life as possible... but it all comes at a cost:</p>
<p>Flights for 6 to our various destinations: £5,000</p>
<p>Venue and production costs: £750</p>
<p>Marketing and promotion: £200</p>
<p>Insurance: £1000</p>
<p>We will of course be seeing a return from our ticket sales, projected at around £2500, but this will not be until after we have finished our tour and we need all the help we can get from you lovely people to get us there!</p>
<p>If we sadly do not reach our goal, any conribution large or small will still go far in helping us reach our destinations, and if we are lucky enough to raise more than our total any money surplus will go into company development to ensure longevity and help future projects. </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Oyster Boy explores what it means to be different in a world where appearance is key and celebrates everything a little bit different. We amalgamate a wide mix of theatrical styles in order to make a piece full of energy, fun, beauty and poignancy that leaves audiences not just entertained but moved.</p>
<p>We are a grass roots company making our way in the world, and we are interested in making affecting theatre that defies pretention and welcomes audiences from all backgrounds to join in our fun. We are part of a strong new wave of young theatre makers who want theatre to be for everybody and not just regular theatre goers.</p>
<p>We are performing Oyster Boy in schools around London, a scheduled street performance as well as traditional theatre venues in order to reach as many people as possible, and your support will go a long LONG way in helping us.</p>

Her darkly comic heroes journey takes her from the basement of Hortaman's funeral home, to the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, to the mountains of Nepal (with plenty of Star Wars Jokes and strange characters along the way), as she seeks to understand her deep connection to the mythical Abominable Snowman. Written by Katie May, directed by Chloe Bronzan, and produced in conjunction with Symmetry Theatre Company as part of PlayGround's 20th annual PlayGround Festival of New Works, this is a play for the lonely hearts, the awkward monsters, and the unabashed geeks inside us all. We mentioned there's a Yeti in it, right?This play was commissioned by PlayGround. It had a staged reading in the Best of PlayGround Festival in May of 2013.  It was further developed at The Lark New Play Development Center in NYC, and it has an amazing cast of actors many of whom have been with the project since day one. And now we're ready for a full production, with a rock star team of talent on board. But we want to do it right. That's where you come in.The When and the Where

“The Edwin Booth Company Presents…”
provides a unique opportunity for the students in University of
Wisconsin-Whitewater’s Theatre/Dance Department like nothing that this
department has done before during the academic season.
It is an original script and the students will
be presenting the world premiere performance opening on November 29,  2011. The next
step in this educational experience is to take our show on the road and share
this accomplishment with the theatre community. This is where you can help!

<div>
<p>Hello! We are Sheldon Carpenter and Ilyssa DePonte, co-founders of Torrent Theatre. We have been working over the past few months to prepare Neil LaBute’s <i>Reasons To Be Pretty</i>, and we need your help to present a fully-fledged production of this tragically beautiful comedy.</p>
<p>A love story about the impossibility of love, <i>Reasons To Be Pretty</i> introduces us to Greg, who really, truly adores his girlfriend, Steph. Unfortunately, he also thinks she has a few physical imperfections, and when he casually mentions them, all hell breaks loose. A hopelessly romantic drama about the hopelessness of romance, <i>Reasons To Be Pretty</i> is a <i>gorgeous</i> play.</p>
<p>As a team, we strive to take the training we’ve received at or Alma Mater (Albright College) and our life experiences thus far in order to produce theater that consistently pushes the envelope and challenges our society’s ideals, presenting works that encourage our audience to start a dialogue about humanity and social norms. What has come to be expected of us? Have we fallen into a trap - a vicious cycle of repetitive motions? Do we embrace the status quo and cling to tradition, or do we choose to resist that cycle and make waves in order to strive for something better?</p>

<p>Producing a play is not an easy or inexpensive venture which is why we need your help. In order to bring this play to an audience, we need to raise $4,500. This includes the costs of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Royalties</li>
<li>Performance Space</li>
<li>Rehearsal Space</li>
<li>Props and Scenery</li>
<li>Costumes</li>
<li>Promotional Materials</li>

</ul>
<div><br/></div>
</div><div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<div>
<p>If you’re poor (like us) and cannot afford to donate to our cause, all we ask is that you share this campaign to everyone you know in hopes that it can reach even further. If we can get ten different people to donate at least ten dollars every day, we will be able to reach our goal and bring you this witheringly funny dark comedy that is <i>Reasons To Be Pretty</i>.</p>

Hello! We are Sheldon Carpenter and Ilyssa DePonte, co-founders of Torrent Theatre. We have been working over the past few months to prepare Neil LaBute’s Reasons To Be Pretty, and we need your help to present a fully-fledged production of this tragically beautiful comedy.
A love story about the impossibility of love, Reasons To Be Pretty introduces us to Greg, who really, truly adores his girlfriend, Steph. Unfortunately, he also thinks she has a few physical imperfections, and when he casually mentions them, all hell breaks loose. A hopelessly romantic drama about the hopelessness of romance, Reasons To Be Pretty is a gorgeous play.
As a team, we strive to take the training we’ve received at or Alma Mater (Albright College) and our life experiences thus far in order to produce theater that consistently pushes the envelope and challenges our society’s ideals, presenting works that encourage our audience to start a dialogue about humanity and social norms. What has come to be expected of us? Have we fallen into a trap - a vicious cycle of repetitive motions? Do we embrace the status quo and cling to tradition, or do we choose to resist that cycle and make waves in order to strive for something better?

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>This campaign was created to help compensate the dancers for the work done outside of rehearsals to bring this project to a more diverse audience with greater impact, to pave the way for future residencies, tours, and partnerships. The Recognizing Women Project was inaugurated in 2001 with several of its pieces performed for years before. Each year the project brings together a multi-cultural group of around 25 female dancers, ages 16-45, and university students in the social sciences to work as a multi-disciplinary research analysis team. The mission is to help women develop an inter-sectional understanding of their experiences and to share their understandings through community dialogue and public presentation. We feel that the more research we pour into the project, the more urgency we have to share our stories and spark others to do the same. Though emotionally challenging and physically demanding, this work is a labor of love. At the core of it we find undeniable strength and serenity that runs within all women, ready to be awakened and energized.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need to raise $10,000. The Recognizing Women Project includes 6 months of rehearsals and many dancers. The money raised through this campaign will go to the dancers; compensation for the hours of work in the studio and especially, for the time given outside of rehearsals as part of our commitment to sharing this project. Because we value your support tremendously, we’re further offering our time with perks as unique as we are, hopefully as a way to get to know our supporters too. Do you know someone who may need certified tutoring for 7-12th grade? Been wanting to try AntiGravity yoga or the GYROTONIC® Method? Maybe you just haven’t taken Nathan’s class in a while and want to join us for company class and rehearsal! We want to share these experiences and other services with you!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Today, women are standing up and telling their stories, and in doing so, encouraging others to. The Recognizing Women Project is a platform for women to connect deeper and experience the strength that lives within vulnerability. It has created a space where women regularly witness each other share experiences by which they once felt isolated. These testimonials from past projects show the lifelong impact of the work we're doing today.</p>

<li>""Recognizing the fact that our existence is something to behold"" 1996 Participant</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The challenges we face are ones that many NY residents and artists will understand. We spend hours commuting on trains going to and from rehearsals, jobs, and second (maybe third) jobs. We also know that there are many small companies and projects in need of support. The dancing, administrative and organizational work for the RWP however, has lent us a space to heal from the challenges of our personal histories and from female objectification. It has given us a community to depend on throughout that healing, and ultimately, this allows us to meet and exceed these challenges with spirited energy to be thrifty and determined! This is what must be shared, and what your donations will allow us to continue to share.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you cannot give at this time, or if you're looking for more ways to help us achieve our goal:</p>

Each year the project brings together a multi-cultural group of around 25 female dancers, ages 16-45, and university students in the social sciences to work as a multi-disciplinary research analysis team. The mission is to help women develop an inter-sectional understanding of their experiences and to share their understandings through community dialogue and public presentation. We feel that the more research we pour into the project, the more urgency we have to share our stories and spark others to do the same. Though emotionally challenging and physically demanding, this work is a labor of love. At the core of it we find undeniable strength and serenity that runs within all women, ready to be awakened and energized.

What We Need & What You Get
We need to raise $10,000. The Recognizing Women Project includes 6 months of rehearsals and many dancers. The money raised through this campaign will go to the dancers; compensation for the hours of work in the studio and especially, for the time given outside of rehearsals as part of our commitment to sharing this project. Because we value your support tremendously, we’re further offering our time with perks as unique as we are, hopefully as a way to get to know our supporters too. Do you know someone who may need certified tutoring for 7-12th grade? Been wanting to try AntiGravity yoga or the GYROTONIC® Method? Maybe you just haven’t taken Nathan’s class in a while and want to join us for company class and rehearsal! We want to share these experiences and other services with you!

The Impact
Today, women are standing up and telling their stories, and in doing so, encouraging others to. The Recognizing Women Project is a platform for women to connect deeper and experience the strength that lives within vulnerability. It has created a space where women regularly witness each other share experiences by which they once felt isolated. These testimonials from past projects show the lifelong impact of the work we're doing today.

""[The RWP] allowed me to connect with women of all different cultural backgrounds and relate to one another on an emotional and intellectual level"" 2017 Participant
""I learned sisterhood from the work I did with fellow cast members"" 2011 Participant
""The investigative process was really rewarding, and helped me to go deeper into my own identity, understand my heritage, my past and see how it fits into the present."" 2002 participant
""Recognizing the fact that our existence is something to behold"" 1996 Participant


Risks & Challenges
The challenges we face are ones that many NY residents and artists will understand. We spend hours commuting on trains going to and from rehearsals, jobs, and second (maybe third) jobs. We also know that there are many small companies and projects in need of support. The dancing, administrative and organizational work for the RWP however, has lent us a space to heal from the challenges of our personal histories and from female objectification. It has given us a community to depend on throughout that healing, and ultimately, this allows us to meet and exceed these challenges with spirited energy to be thrifty and determined! This is what must be shared, and what your donations will allow us to continue to share.

<p><strong>Smashworks Dance Collective</strong>, directed by choreographer Ashley McQueen, is a New York-based group of movers dedicated to the strengthening of artistic voice and experiential movement. Originally founded in St. Louis amidst performances presented by ANNONYArts, Smashworks relocated to New York City in 2015.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1476241201/hnwmtnyv2ni1u88cqynk.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/> </p>
<h3>Who We Are </h3>
<p>My name is Ashley McQueen, and I am a dancer, choreographer, and Artistic Director for Smashworks Dance Collective. Originally from Alabama, I received my BFA in Dance from Webster University and danced professionally in St. Louis for two years while choreographing throughout the area. I am currently pursuing my MFA in Dance from Hollins University, class of 2018.</p>
<p>Over a year ago I gave away my car, sold my furniture, and moved from St. Louis to New York with two suitcases and a dream to build a dance company that ignites passion, prompts conversation, and showcases the value of the arts in society. </p>
<p>Last year, Smashworks performed at eight festivals across the five boroughs, including a 30-minute work presented by <i>Take Root</i> at Green Space in Long Island City. This year we will highlight  eight talented dancers in performances ranging from windows on Wall Street to a winery in Santa Barbara as part of a bi-coastal collaborative tour.</p>
<h3>The Company</h3>
<p>This is Smashworks' second New York season, and we are embarking on our first evening length production this January. We are thrilled to present three original works inspired by experiences of real people throughout the city. These pieces feature scenes that every New Yorker will recognize, from the grittiness of the morning subway commute to the socio-economic melting pot of daily life on and around Wall Street. Eight brilliant performers will bring these scenes to life on stage, providing an evocative audience experience that will encourage reflection and dialogue about what it means to be a New Yorker.</p>
<p><strong>Performers</strong>: Laurie Deziel, Jesse Obremski, Sarah Dodd, Maria Gardner, Evelyn Joy Hoelscher, Ellen Sickenberger, Sarah Starkweather, Maria Vittoria Villa, and Ashley McQueen. </p>

<p>I also aim to present work that questions our identity as ""New Yorkers."" How do we define ourselves? How are we defined by others? In what ways does our environment impact our overall perception and sense of self?</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Broads' Word Ensemble came together when seven women sat down and said: “there’s a scarcity of strong roles for women in the theatre. Let’s change that.”</p>
<p>So we are.</p>
<p>After three successful productions in two years, we are ready to expand. Join Broads’ Word Ensemble for our first full season as we continue our charge to break barriers and shatter ceilings for women artists and female representation.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the spring, we’re presenting Barbara Kahn’s docu-comedy<i> The Lady Was a Gentleman</i>. The play follows one of America’s greatest unknown actresses of the 1800’s, Charlotte Cushman, a lesbian who played both male and female roles, as she encounters a host of other women and their exploits. </li>
<li>In June, we're putting our stamp on a classic by a female playwright from “The Other Canon” for the Hollywood Fringe Festival.</li>
<li>In the fall, we are partnering with the Los Angeles Female Playwrights Initiative (LAFPI) to host a staged reading festival for original 10-minute plays or short excerpts from original full-length scripts from Los Angeles based female playwrights. </li>
</ul>
<p>Can we count on your support to make this production a reality? Please contribute however you can today, and be a part of this journey.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need at least $16,500 to fund the three performances of our first full season. Our projected expenses break down like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>$7,500 actor and production team compensation</li>
<li>$5,700 venue rent and insurance</li>
<li>$2,100 production materials</li>
<li>$1,200 promotion</li>
</ul>
<p>Additional funds would increase our production value, participant compensation, and allow for more participants to join our season.</p>
<p>Since you are supporting live theatre, a contribution as small as $25 already gets you a ticket to Barbara Kahn’s <i>The Lady Was a Gentleman</i>.</p>
<p>Want to secure seats to the entire season? We have several options to ensure you never miss a performance.</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Our goal is to create a space and forum for emerging female artists throughout Los Angeles in a field overwhelmingly dominated by men.</p>
<p>In a theatrical climate where there are always an abundance of talented actresses and very few good roles for them to bring to life, Broads' Word Ensemble is dedicated to letting those actresses shine in a way you've never seen them before.</p>
<p>Hand in hand with our mission of putting women on stage, we support parity across all areas of theatre. Our productions are geared toward providing substantive, creative opportunities for women in theatre as performers, directors, writers, producers, and all other aspects of the craft.</p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As experienced theatre practitioners dedicated to parity in Los Angeles theatre, Broads' Word Ensemble will use every dollar we raise for our 2017 season. The biggest challenges are funding for participant compensation and venue rent. If we are not fully funded, the scope of the season and/or the compensation we are able to offer our participants may decrease.</p>
<h3>Tax Deductible Donation</h3>
<p>Broads' Word Ensemble 2017 Season is a sponsored project of <a href=""https://www.fracturedatlas.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Fractured Atlas</a>, a non-profit arts service organization. Contributions for the charitable purposes of Broads' Word Ensemble 2017 Season must be made payable to Fractured Atlas only and are tax-deductible to the extent permitted by law.</p>
<p>All perks require your shipping information, so Fractured Atlas can issue tax receipts. </p>
<p>To receive the largest benefit from your donation, you can choose not to receive a perk. The non-deductible value of some perk items (such as the face value of tickets to our shows) will reduce the tax-deductible value of your donation.</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't contribute right now, we totally get it! There are non-monetary ways you can lend a hand...</p>
<ul>
<li>When you see our Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram posts, share 'em! Helping us get the word out is huge, and we really appreciate it -- not just for this campaign, but for the good of the company in general.</li>
<li>Have you had a great time at a Broads' Word show? Tell the world! If you share our fundraising link along with an anecdote about how worthwhile our work is, that's huge. </li>
<li>If you know someone who is a patron of the arts (or wants to be), let them specifically know about Broads' Word and our campaign! </li>
<li>Have we posted a picture that entertained you or article that caught your eye? Pass that along to your pals, and include our good ol' fundraiser link. (Pretty sneaky, sis.)</li>
<li>Basically, tell your mama, tell your friends, tell anyone whose heart can comprehend. Send it in a letter baby, tell them on the phone, we're not the kind of Broads who like to work alone. (Are we paraphrasing Janet Jackson? Uh, that's Miss Jackson if you're nasty. And yes.)    </li>

In the spring, we’re presenting Barbara Kahn’s docu-comedy The Lady Was a Gentleman. The play follows one of America’s greatest unknown actresses of the 1800’s, Charlotte Cushman, a lesbian who played both male and female roles, as she encounters a host of other women and their exploits. 
In June, we're putting our stamp on a classic by a female playwright from “The Other Canon” for the Hollywood Fringe Festival.
In the fall, we are partnering with the Los Angeles Female Playwrights Initiative (LAFPI) to host a staged reading festival for original 10-minute plays or short excerpts from original full-length scripts from Los Angeles based female playwrights. 

Can we count on your support to make this production a reality? Please contribute however you can today, and be a part of this journey.
What We Need & What You Get
We need at least $16,500 to fund the three performances of our first full season. Our projected expenses break down like this:

$7,500 actor and production team compensation
$5,700 venue rent and insurance
$2,100 production materials
$1,200 promotion

Additional funds would increase our production value, participant compensation, and allow for more participants to join our season.
Since you are supporting live theatre, a contribution as small as $25 already gets you a ticket to Barbara Kahn’s The Lady Was a Gentleman.
Want to secure seats to the entire season? We have several options to ensure you never miss a performance.
The Impact
Our goal is to create a space and forum for emerging female artists throughout Los Angeles in a field overwhelmingly dominated by men.
In a theatrical climate where there are always an abundance of talented actresses and very few good roles for them to bring to life, Broads' Word Ensemble is dedicated to letting those actresses shine in a way you've never seen them before.
Hand in hand with our mission of putting women on stage, we support parity across all areas of theatre. Our productions are geared toward providing substantive, creative opportunities for women in theatre as performers, directors, writers, producers, and all other aspects of the craft.
Risks & Challenges
As experienced theatre practitioners dedicated to parity in Los Angeles theatre, Broads' Word Ensemble will use every dollar we raise for our 2017 season. The biggest challenges are funding for participant compensation and venue rent. If we are not fully funded, the scope of the season and/or the compensation we are able to offer our participants may decrease.
Tax Deductible Donation
Broads' Word Ensemble 2017 Season is a sponsored project of Fractured Atlas, a non-profit arts service organization. Contributions for the charitable purposes of Broads' Word Ensemble 2017 Season must be made payable to Fractured Atlas only and are tax-deductible to the extent permitted by law.
All perks require your shipping information, so Fractured Atlas can issue tax receipts. 
To receive the largest benefit from your donation, you can choose not to receive a perk. The non-deductible value of some perk items (such as the face value of tickets to our shows) will reduce the tax-deductible value of your donation.
Other Ways You Can Help
If you can't contribute right now, we totally get it! There are non-monetary ways you can lend a hand...

When you see our Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram posts, share 'em! Helping us get the word out is huge, and we really appreciate it -- not just for this campaign, but for the good of the company in general.
Have you had a great time at a Broads' Word show? Tell the world! If you share our fundraising link along with an anecdote about how worthwhile our work is, that's huge. 
If you know someone who is a patron of the arts (or wants to be), let them specifically know about Broads' Word and our campaign! 
Have we posted a picture that entertained you or article that caught your eye? Pass that along to your pals, and include our good ol' fundraiser link. (Pretty sneaky, sis.)
Basically, tell your mama, tell your friends, tell anyone whose heart can comprehend. Send it in a letter baby, tell them on the phone, we're not the kind of Broads who like to work alone. (Are we paraphrasing Janet Jackson? Uh, that's Miss Jackson if you're nasty. And yes.)",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>The goal of this campaign is simple -- to raise money to better compensate actors who are pursuing their dream of making a living on stage. I am self-funding and self-producing the world premiere of my play ""With Hidden Noise"" as part of the New York Theater Festival.                        (<a href=""http://newyorktheaterfestival.com/with-hidden-noise/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://newyorktheaterfestival.com/with-hidden-n...</a>). The play will run on August 9, 10, and 13.</p>
<p>I am paying the four very talented actors what I consider to be a modest stipend, but they deserve to be paid more. That's the point of this campaign. <strong>100% of the donations</strong> will go to the actors. Not one cent will go to me to pay for the production.</p>
<p>The four actors in my cast are pursuing their dream and are acting because they love working in live theater. They recognize how competitive theater is in New York and they are willing to work for low pay. This campaign is an attempt to reward them beyond what I can afford to pay, to show that others value their work and the dream they're pursuing.</p>
<p>I'm not offering fabulous perks as thanks for donations because I suspect that most people who will donate will do so because they value live theater and want actors to be fairly paid for their work. But, I do want to thank you for donating, so for every $50 donation, you will receive a copy of the play, signed by the playwright, director and entire cast. For every $100 donation, you will receive a signed copy of the play plus a link to a video of the play.</p>

<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">For veteran performer Gemma Wilcox her third time at the Victoria Fringe is more than a charm, it’s a pleasure. Especially as she’s arriving with a sparkling new award-winning multi-character, one-woman show, <em>Magical Mystery Detour.</em></p>
<p><b>Who is Gemma Wilcox?</b></p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">Good question.  Well, addressing the performer part of me, here goes: I am the actor/playwright/director/producer of Gemma Wilcox Productions. Born and raised in London, U.K., I am now based in majestic Boulder, Colorado, where I have been living, breathing and creating theatre for the past 10 years.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">I am a strong believer in the power of great, heartfelt live theatre to awaken, enliven, and inspire the human spirit. Since 2001, I have been creating, writing, performing and producing original, highly physical, heart-fully humorous, tenderly moving, and deeply authentic theatre. I have written five one-woman multi-character shows, and two two-person shows, and toured them to 36 fringe festivals across the U.S.A. and Canada. </p>
<p><b>With <em>Magical Mystery Detour</em>, you get back on the Fringe circuit for the third time. After all this time, does the process of creation and development become even easier and more organic or does the danger of being static get bigger and the discovery of originality even harder?</b></p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">Actually, I have been touring three of my one-woman shows for past 10 years.  But this is my third time in Victoria. I think it does, on the whole, become a wee bit easier and organic, and it certainly helps that people remember you from previous years.  Yes, it can be challenging to keep things fresh and present, but I actually love that particular challenge; every show I aim to perform it as if it was my first time ever.</p>
<p><b>So what can audiences expect to find on the <em>Magical Mystery Detour?</em> Besides a nostalgic show title.  </b></p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">Well, it is a magical mystery detour, not tour. So humor, laughter, maybe tears, frustration, feeling like you are going one way in life and then realize that life has other plans for you, blocked roads, detour signs, letting go, release, and opening up to the mystery of life.</p>
<p><b>Out of the other runners in this year’s Fringe, whom would you recommend that audiences check out? If you don’t mind throwing fuel to the competition.</b></p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">Definitely see the Wonderheads new show, and shows by TJ Dawe, Steve Larkin, Travis Burnhardt, Nancy Kenny, Jem Rolls, and I heard Kit and Jane were pretty awesome. </p>
<p><b>Where does a performer with your experience draw their inspiration? </b></p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">My life. All my shows are semi-autobiographical. I love exploring the mundane and sacred aspects of intimate relationship. </p>
<p><b>What advice would you share with first time Fringe performers? </b></p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">Flyer like crazy, don’t be shy to ask fringe veterans for advice, rest and eat well, work hard and gently and play hard and gently, make sure you take days off, hit the streets and poster as soon as you arrive. </p>
<p><b>14 Best of Fest’s is certainly nothing to scoff at. I’m curious, do you use this as a measure of experience or a spur to make you work even harder at your material? </b></p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">Both. When I am feeling a little insecure about writing a new show, it’s great to remember that I can write and create successful work. I am always trying to create work that brings me to my edge as a performer. I just need to listen to what is inspiring for me and exciting and challenging in my life at the time. But mostly, at the end of the day, the awards help the most with publicity.</p>
<p><b>What’s the best thing about being a performer/working in the arts and alternatively what’s the most challenging/frustrating? Besides money of course. </b></p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">I love and feel very grateful to be doing what I love and making the majority of my living from doing what I love to do. The lack of consistency in income is a little challenging. The lottery of the fringe festival applications is also a bit tricky when trying to plan my summer work schedule. I get to explore and embody many aspects of myself and the human condition, and animals and inanimate objects in my case.</p>
<p><b>In the next few years, I’m curious in what direction you’d like to develop your work towards? Do you think you’re on the right path at the moment?</b></p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">Wow, intense question. And one I have been chewing over a lot myself at the ripe old age of 36. Over the next year I have decided to shift my creative attention to creating a program where I will be teaching workshops and helping artists unblock areas in their creative expression where they feel held back and stuck.  I will still tour the fringes in the summer, with my three one-woman shows, and then most likely create a new show in the winter of next year. I believe this is the right path for me right now.</p>
<p><b>What are you most excited to share with audiences in this piece?</b></p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">The simple joy of the dog character I play, and the talking car and Queen characters. I am also excited to see how the slightly more esoteric aspects of this show land with audiences in Victoria. </p>
<p><b>Ultimately, why should audiences come and see the <em>Magical Mystery Detour?  </em></b></p>

<p>Sandra is a single woman with a career, friends, a dog, and a seemingly normal life. The audience learns early on that her mother has recently passed, and this is clearly a weight Sandra carries. Wilcox’s performance was not just of Sandra but of many other characters including people, inanimate objects, and various animals. The other characters brought humour to the piece but also brought the audience closer to the performance. The play was full of truth with a magnifying glass directed at the insecurities of your mid-30s, and was easy to connect to. The play altogether was more light than heavy, with plenty of laughs through the characters and Sandra’s quirks.

</div></div>","I am Gemma Wilcox, actor/playwright/director/producer of Gemma Wilcox Productions. Born and raised in London, UK, I am now based in majestical Boulder, Colorado where I have been living, breathing and creating theatre for the past 10 years.  
Some you know me, but for those of you that don't here is a little bit about me and my work:


I am a strong believer in the power of GREAT, heartfelt live theatre to awaken, enliven and inspire the human spirit!
Since 2001, I have been creating, writing, performing and producing original, highly physical, heart-fully humorous, tenderly moving, and deeply authentic theatre.  
I have written 5 one-woman, multi-character shows, and 2 two-person shows,  and toured them to 36 fringe festivals across USA and Canada. 

My shows have received 14 'Best-of-Fest' Awards.



THIS SUMMER, I am thrilled beyond belief to be performing 3 of my 1-woman
shows, for 28 performances, at 6 different theatres, over 3 months, in 5 cities, in 2 countries!
I
have been touring across Canada and USA since 2003, and have never done a fundraising campaign, but this year the tour
costs are way more than they have ever been!  Seriously! For instance, Edmonton Fringe Festival alone is $5000 in sheer expenses!
SO...
♥ This
summer I need your help to produce and offer my work in the following places:





July
     9-13, 2014 - REGINA, CANADA - The Honeymoon Period is Officially Over @
     Regina Fringe Festival

July
     25, 2014 - BOULDER, CO - Magical
     Mystery Detour @ Wesley Chapel
     Theatre



Aug
     14-24, 2014 - EDMONTON, CANADA - The Honeymoon Period is Officially Over @
     Edmonton Fringe Festival



Aug
     22-31 - 2014 - VICTORIA, CANADA - Magical Mystery Detour @

Oct
     11, 2014 - NEW YORK, NY-Extract from shows @ Emerging Women Conference




What I Need & What You Get In order to successful and sanely execute this tour without breaking the bank I intend to raise at least $12,000* to cover my basic expenses! 
Check out the sexy pie chart below (designed by the lovely and talented Kelly Sosan Bearer), to see what your money goes towards. 
*PLEASE NOTE: The $12,000 I am aiming to raise does not cover all of my tour expenses this summer. The actual expenses are $15,000 for all the production and touring costs, and this does not include paying myself as the performer .

Expenses for Gemma's Summer Tour 2014



Now...if you donate to this campaign you can get some extra sweet perks (and each perk includes the perk before it!) that are even sexier than this pie chart!  These include VIP tickets to any Gemma Wilcox show, signed copies of the show soundtrack, happy hour drinks with the artists....AND, if you really throw in the big bucks you can get a 1:1 creativity session with Gemma, name a character in the show, or become an executive producer of the show (whilst getting a sweet tax break! ;-))  
Pretty Awesome!

Update #1
The Honeymoon Period is Officially Over Gets 4.5 Stars from Edmonton Journal


The Honeymoon Period is Officially Over
""4.5 stars out of 5
Stage 48, Rutherford School
Gemma Wilcox is an amazing party favour for first-time visitors to the Fringe festivities. Her solo show, The Honeymoon Period is Officially Over, returning here after five years away, is a reminder of what theatre can be.
Physical theatre and multiple role-playing are her specialties, with everything in play, including inanimate objects. In this funny-sad tale of a foundering romance, Wilcox shifts seamlessly from female to male characters but she slips just as comfortably into the skin of a house pet. She’s a saxophone at one point; a flaming fire you simply must stare into; the most astonishing peacock in all the world.
A wickedly flexible body, a sly wit, and a riveting stage presence conjure up a virtuoso performance. Run to see her, brush up to a jolt of pure energy.
We come to learn that this British-born dynamo, now based in Boulder, Col., packs along these multiple personalities on an almost constant tour schedule. Can such wild versatility be snapped on and off like a kitchen light? It makes you wonder who Wilcox is when she’s alone.""
— Richard Helm

Magical Mystery Detour - The Interview


For veteran performer Gemma Wilcox her third time at the Victoria Fringe is more than a charm, it’s a pleasure. Especially as she’s arriving with a sparkling new award-winning multi-character, one-woman show, Magical Mystery Detour.
Who is Gemma Wilcox?
Good question.  Well, addressing the performer part of me, here goes: I am the actor/playwright/director/producer of Gemma Wilcox Productions. Born and raised in London, U.K., I am now based in majestic Boulder, Colorado, where I have been living, breathing and creating theatre for the past 10 years.
I am a strong believer in the power of great, heartfelt live theatre to awaken, enliven, and inspire the human spirit. Since 2001, I have been creating, writing, performing and producing original, highly physical, heart-fully humorous, tenderly moving, and deeply authentic theatre. I have written five one-woman multi-character shows, and two two-person shows, and toured them to 36 fringe festivals across the U.S.A. and Canada. 
With Magical Mystery Detour, you get back on the Fringe circuit for the third time. After all this time, does the process of creation and development become even easier and more organic or does the danger of being static get bigger and the discovery of originality even harder?
Actually, I have been touring three of my one-woman shows for past 10 years.  But this is my third time in Victoria. I think it does, on the whole, become a wee bit easier and organic, and it certainly helps that people remember you from previous years.  Yes, it can be challenging to keep things fresh and present, but I actually love that particular challenge; every show I aim to perform it as if it was my first time ever.
So what can audiences expect to find on the Magical Mystery Detour? Besides a nostalgic show title.  
Well, it is a magical mystery detour, not tour. So humor, laughter, maybe tears, frustration, feeling like you are going one way in life and then realize that life has other plans for you, blocked roads, detour signs, letting go, release, and opening up to the mystery of life.
Out of the other runners in this year’s Fringe, whom would you recommend that audiences check out? If you don’t mind throwing fuel to the competition.
Definitely see the Wonderheads new show, and shows by TJ Dawe, Steve Larkin, Travis Burnhardt, Nancy Kenny, Jem Rolls, and I heard Kit and Jane were pretty awesome. 
Where does a performer with your experience draw their inspiration? 
My life. All my shows are semi-autobiographical. I love exploring the mundane and sacred aspects of intimate relationship. 
What advice would you share with first time Fringe performers? 
Flyer like crazy, don’t be shy to ask fringe veterans for advice, rest and eat well, work hard and gently and play hard and gently, make sure you take days off, hit the streets and poster as soon as you arrive. 
14 Best of Fest’s is certainly nothing to scoff at. I’m curious, do you use this as a measure of experience or a spur to make you work even harder at your material? 
Both. When I am feeling a little insecure about writing a new show, it’s great to remember that I can write and create successful work. I am always trying to create work that brings me to my edge as a performer. I just need to listen to what is inspiring for me and exciting and challenging in my life at the time. But mostly, at the end of the day, the awards help the most with publicity.
What’s the best thing about being a performer/working in the arts and alternatively what’s the most challenging/frustrating? Besides money of course. 
I love and feel very grateful to be doing what I love and making the majority of my living from doing what I love to do. The lack of consistency in income is a little challenging. The lottery of the fringe festival applications is also a bit tricky when trying to plan my summer work schedule. I get to explore and embody many aspects of myself and the human condition, and animals and inanimate objects in my case.
In the next few years, I’m curious in what direction you’d like to develop your work towards? Do you think you’re on the right path at the moment?
Wow, intense question. And one I have been chewing over a lot myself at the ripe old age of 36. Over the next year I have decided to shift my creative attention to creating a program where I will be teaching workshops and helping artists unblock areas in their creative expression where they feel held back and stuck.  I will still tour the fringes in the summer, with my three one-woman shows, and then most likely create a new show in the winter of next year. I believe this is the right path for me right now.
What are you most excited to share with audiences in this piece?
The simple joy of the dog character I play, and the talking car and Queen characters. I am also excited to see how the slightly more esoteric aspects of this show land with audiences in Victoria. 
Ultimately, why should audiences come and see the Magical Mystery Detour?  
Because you will be taken away on a theatrical magical mystery ride.
