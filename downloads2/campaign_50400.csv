<p>Hello to Everyone!</p>
<p>Every year just after
the fall season arrives, the Black Hills Powwow &amp; Games committee, headed
by President Stephen Yellowhawk and supported by the rest of the committee and
staff, organizes a great gathering for the indigenous people of North America (and
all over the world!) with dance and games which are entirely supported by local
and regional donations.  It is truly a
beautiful sight to behold and an experience like no other. I am honored to have
been given the opportunity to come again this year and be a part of this powerful
event October 9-11, 2015. In the Lakota language, the Black Hills Powwow &amp;
Games is the ""He Sapa Wacipi Na Oskate"".<br/>
<br/>
In years past of 2012 and 2014 I donated my time and talents to this event and captured
many great images. I was able to gift these images to the Black Hills Powwow
committee free of charge. These images are used for future years' campaigning,
donation raising, web site, historical preservation and media representation. 
I have freely given copies of my images via email to anyone of the attendees
who wish for copies of the images. I also have a few of my own favorite dancers
and of course I always try to get awesome images of them and for them.</p>
<p>I have been touched in
so many ways by the Lakota people of the Black Hills of South Dakota. Being
married into the culture for a time, I learned and experienced things that I
will never forget nor will I ever take for granted.  Even though the marriage is no more, I will
always be, in my heart, married to the Lakota people. It is extremely important
to me and countless others that all indigenous cultures and their languages are
kept alive and even more they should thrive. One way to keep traditions and
even current trends alive and to send them down through history is via
photographic images</p>
<p>My goal here is to
pass down my images to the people. In the coming years I am very interested in
the possibility of compiling a book of images for the Black Hills Powwow
Association, and this may be a funding campaign of mine for the future; the
proceeds of which would be in part donated to the Black Hills Powwow
Association. THANK YOU in advance for helping achieve my goal this year to complete

Not Your Average Love Story

""Britton
and I both lost spouses to cancer prior to meeting one another. Britton's
wife, Jax, and my husband, Ruben, both relied on MyLifeLine.org to relay
information to loved ones who anxiously awaited updates. It was actually
the founder of MyLifeLine.org, Marcia Donziger, who introduced us at a
time when we both needed to talk with someone who understood.""

- Jen Garza Thomas
Jen & Britton are getting married on July 16, 2015.   They inspired MyLifeLine.org to raise awareness for the 
family caregivers taking care of their loved ones with cancer.  
By funding this campaign, you're becoming part
 of a bigger community that provides critical resources to support the 
millions of others hurting from the effects of seeing a loved one go 
through a cancer diagnosis.  
With your support, we can keep love going. 




Why Are We #Ribboning?
When you lose someone you love, your whole world changes and just finding the courage to get out of bed in the morning becomes a weight only those who've experienced tragedy would know.  What started as two grieving souls supporting one another, blossomed into a second chance at love after loss.  All because of MyLifeLine.org.


The Impact
MyLifeLine.org's vision is to create the most innovative social network 
in the world dedicated to the unique
needs of families affected by cancer. 

Since inception in 2007, 130,000 people have registered on MyLifeLine.org to 
give or receive support.  Research proves a
strong support community is vital to positive healing outcomes. 

MyLifeLine.org is a FREE resource which provides:


Ease of communication and connection
with loved ones
Ongoing encouragement and inspiration,
anytime, anywhere 
Comprehensive cancer-specific resources, education, and personalized online support community 
Vital and unique tools on one
integrated social network

Learn more about MyLifeLine.org and our impact on families affected by cancer.
Where Your Money Goes

We provide patients and caregivers with personalized, private online communities
where they can post updates for friends and family, coordinate volunteers, discover the best cancer resources, and
request donations for medical expenses and other vital needs.  MyLifeLine.org needs funding to:
Add pediatric oncology features for families of children facing cancer
Raise awareness to spread the message of ""caring for the caregivers"" 
Develop a MyLifeLine.org mobile app
Redesign website to provide a better user experience




""As a cancer survivor, my vision in founding MyLifeLine.org was to ensure no one faces cancer alone by creating a platform that focuses 100% on the unique needs of families impacted by cancer.  




Over the years, we've learned that the needs of family caregivers have been overlooked for so long.  We are #Ribboning to shed light on the issues faced by caregivers.  Some of the issues include fear, isolation, emotional and financial stress.  We provide solutions to overcome these barriers to recovery.  
MyLifeLine.org is about the people....connecting communities, because the community around each patient plays a critical role throughout the treatment and healing process.""
~ Marcia Donziger, Founder and Chief Mission Officer




Ribbon, Give, and Share!


Jen and Britton are asking wedding
guests and friends to back this campaign to support the organization's free services they provide to thousands of families affected by cancer.  

What Is #Ribboning?
There was Planking. Then Tebowing. Now, there's #Ribboning.  
#Ribboning is 
drawing attention to the people behind a cause and a cancer, rather than
 the condition itself.  We do this in support of people affected by cancer and to be a celebration for having made a donation to MyLifeLine.org.

     
    

Who will you be #Ribboning for?
Challenge your friends to a contest. Grab a friend and ribbon 
together, set a goal and ribbon at the end of a climb, or dress in the 
color of the ribbon for the cancer you support. Ribbon from the

<div>We Can Stop Veteran Suicides!<br/>...BUT it takes an innovative approach to solve this problem.<br/><br/><p>WE ARE THE<span> </span><span>VETERANS SUICIDE PREVENTION CHANNEL
</span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The Veterans Suicide Prevention Channel's (VSPChannel) goal is to create a Veterans National Broadcast
Television Channel in America that produces and broadcasts
programming specifically designed to meet the emotional, therapeutic and informational needs of our nation’s veterans. By doing so, we hope to
reduce and eventually eliminate  veteran suicides in America.
The VSPChannel will broadcast shows that will promote wellness, guidance, referral and information to veterans
and their family members dealing with PTSD, depression and anxiety. A great number of
veterans will not go to the VA to seek help. We believe that the VSPChannel
will help many veterans with health and mental health issues in the comfort of their own homes. This is a powerful
idea whose time has come, but we cannot make it happen without your support.
PLEASE DONATE TODAY!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The VSPChannel is an organization comprised
of veterans and concerned volunteers working together to try and stop veteran suicides
in America. We are a nonprofit organization that was founded on January 16, 2015 and
we have been granted  501 (c) (3) status by the IRS. <br/></p>
<p>WHO ARE WE?
</p>
<p>Our Board of Directors:<br/>

<p>WHY ARE WE HERE?
</p>
<p>There are many good causes in America that may ask for your time, support and
donations, but none quite as moving as stopping veteran suicides and protecting and
supporting veteran's immediate family members from the threat of losing a cherished member of their family. When a veteran commits suicide in America,
there are so many people affected by the inexplicable loss. It is our intent to end veteran
suicides in America through our innovative approach to this terrible lingering problem.
</p>
<p>WHAT WILL YOU BE SUPPORTING WITH YOUR DOLLARS?
</p>
<p>The VSPChannel is creating programming designed to address
the causes of veteran suicides and bring much needed support to thousands of
veterans nationwide in the comfort of their homes. Programs that are informational,
educational and entertaining. Our programs and shows will always be designed to
promote wellness and good mental and emotional health to America’s veterans. They will also provide support for their family members, including those who have already lost a veteran to suicide. Now that you know
about our reason for being, let us give you a little more background on who we are.
Below are links to a few of the shows that we have already managed to create for our
channel.

<p>The VSPChannel will continue to maintain our web presence even after we reach our goal of becoming a National Broadcast Television Channel for America's veterans. A  channel that can be accessed by veterans 24 hours, 7 days
per week in the comfort of their own homes. Once we achieve this goal, we envision our
channel being carried by every cable company in America.

</div></div>","Tea with Mali will reach 12.5 million households this year. You helped transform the web series into a nationally distributed television show.

That’s because you understand the need for a new type of business conversation. We have dedicated 3 years of sweat to highlighting legacy based businesses and community advocates. From baby boomers to young professionals, we reach out and inspire viewers to uncover their passions and live a vibrant life that benefits others.
But now, your source for real insights and tangible guidance may be in jeopardy. Unless we are able to raise funds by the end of October we are in danger of losing the televised version of Tea with Mali. We need your help today. With your contribution, we’ll continue to share positive role models and change makers with you; true visionaries who are making our world better.
That’s why we're relying on you to renew your support for Tea with Mali today. Tea with Mali is about much more than sharing business advice. We're a reminder to those struggling through change or seeking direction that they are capable, they are worthy and they can excel. That's what we're seeking to fund through this campaign and we can’t do this without your financial contributions and social media shares.

<p>Creating fully rendered 2 minutes of animation, out of planned 7.</p>

<ul><li>
<b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Okay, but why only 2 minutes and not all of it?</b><br/>
</li></ul>
<p>There are a few reasons for that:</p>
<p>First of all, the cost is quite BIG, so I decided it would be more sensible to divide the fundraising process into 3 parts :) It's also beneficial to our lovely funders who may see our progress with every campaign.</p>
<p>Secondly, holding 2 minutes of fully done animation in my hand is of a great asset when searching for sponsors who would like to help me fund the rest of the project.</p>

</li></ul>
<p>Because I have already made a 6 minutes long animation all by myself (including the background ie a wooden model). It took me over 3 years, but I did it. I proved to myself that it is very much doable, so now when I'm asking you for help I can guarantee that the project will come to frutition, because I am, after all, an experienced animator. But now I want to create something much bigger! Animation isn't a team work for no reason - have you ever wondered why animated features, games and movies are so well-done? Because they're a work of many people, cooperating and taking care of what each of them is best at. I might be a graphic designer and do some programming but what does it matter? The outcome will be mediocre at best and it will still take a lot of time. This time I want to make it all really high-quality.</p>

<p>Firstly, the animation will travel across the world to various animation festivals, so that you and your family/friends can see it for yourself on the silver screen in your homeland.

It tells a story of a small fox, living in a deserted forest all by himself. His greatest dream is to find a special someone, who could become his friend.

Our goal is to make the two first minutes of what is planned to be a seven minutes-long animation happen.
I’d like you to take a second to recall all these old animated movies you’ve seen as a child. Their beauty and that certain charm, and the magic that remains in your heart for a long time. Traditional animation is a dying art, shrouded in the aura of beauty that can be found in today’s productions very seldom. 
We’re all set to begin animating, the only thing we need now are funds. Animation has always been all about teamwork. Please help us gather the sum necessary to reward the other artists’ hard work - together we can make I Found You a truly magical piece. Every big journey starts with a first step. This is where ours begins.













Life is so much more beautiful when one can live it with their loved ones. But what about those who were never shown any affection? Can friendship still be born without knowing any real love?
There are two things that constantly fill our little fox’s burrow - his treasures and his loneliness. In the vast, deserted forest there are little to no creatures willing to play with this tiny potential predator. Which is why, while chasing a butterfly, he decides to venture deeper into the woods, onto the paths he had never walked before. What awaits him is… another fox!


The main theme of I Found You is loneliness and coping with it, and how sometimes what we’re looking for is closer than we think. I wanted to create a story that’s both bright and real, with the characters that anyone can identify with. The fox is lively, creative, and curious of the world the way small children are. With all of his ups and downs, this story will make you cry both out of laughter and sadness.

As I said, animation is all about team play. I can and am going to do everything I can with my own strength, but without any help delivering the animation may take years. Even now instead of working on the project I am working on saving up to pay for it. Our beautiful animatic, which is the base or a “rough sketch” of animation was done entirely on my own cost, as grants are rarely given to 2D animation projects in Poland. The beautiful art that traditional animation is has been left to die, together with all the artists who still want to create it. Without the funds I am in no way able to produce it - which is what brings me here.



Without the funds I can't gather a team in which every artist would be responsible for what's their forte (or what they feel suits them best for that matter) in order to create something absolutely brilliant together!
This is how, in a simplified version, the classic animation process looks like:










So what exactly is your goal?

Creating fully rendered 2 minutes of animation, out of planned 7.


Okay, but why only 2 minutes and not all of it?

There are a few reasons for that:
First of all, the cost is quite BIG, so I decided it would be more sensible to divide the fundraising process into 3 parts :) It's also beneficial to our lovely funders who may see our progress with every campaign.
Secondly, holding 2 minutes of fully done animation in my hand is of a great asset when searching for sponsors who would like to help me fund the rest of the project.


Why won't you just do everything yourself instead of getting others involved?

Because I have already made a 6 minutes long animation all by myself (including the background ie a wooden model). It took me over 3 years, but I did it. I proved to myself that it is very much doable, so now when I'm asking you for help I can guarantee that the project will come to frutition, because I am, after all, an experienced animator. But now I want to create something much bigger! Animation isn't a team work for no reason - have you ever wondered why animated features, games and movies are so well-done? Because they're a work of many people, cooperating and taking care of what each of them is best at. I might be a graphic designer and do some programming but what does it matter? The outcome will be mediocre at best and it will still take a lot of time. This time I want to make it all really high-quality.


Why won't you reach out to various institutions to get help?

You have no idea how long I've spent doing just that. The entirety of 2014 was just me knocking to every door available and writing hundreds of requests and applications. But there are close to no supporters of traditional animation in my country, and there are no projects or grants for young artists. Well, there are a few, but it will take a long time for me to gather enough money to qualify for their programs.


Are you aware of how much money that is?

All too well. What I'm asking for is support, not financing the entire project, as I pay on my own for what I can. Thanks to your support the production would start anytime now, and not next year (which is an optimistic prediction).


Alright, you'll make the animation and what then?

Firstly, the animation will travel across the world to various animation festivals, so that you and your family/friends can see it for yourself on the silver screen in your homeland. Plus I'd like it to be aired on TV, as having a sample of it I'll be able to try to make it a series or a feature film.







If you contribute, what will your money be used for?


My aim is to create the first two minutes of the animation - which is why I need to gather $4500 to be able to shrink the amount of work per person by engaging other artists.
Most of it I’m planning to do myself, but I would like to enlist the help of other artists.

The other artists' work is estimated to cost about $3000-$3500 per 1 minute. For this part I hope to spend $2000 from the funds gathered via crowdfunding, and $1000-$1500 would come from my own savings.


Similarly, the first minute have about 40 backgrounds. I want them to be just as breathtaking as the animation itself, abundant in details and colours, absolutely perfect. 20 of them I am able to draw alone, and the remaining ones will be a collaboration with various artists from all over the world (the people we need are the ones with similar a art style to mine, to keep the continuity). The cost of their commissions is estimated to be about $4000 ($200 per background) - just like with the animation, about $2000 would come from crowdfunding, and the rest is on me.
The $500 that remains will be used for perks. Should there be any additional funds left or if the project gets more than its initial goal, all will be evenly divided between the animation and backgrounds, with the next few minutes in sight.

<b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The Right to Kill</b><br/>
</h3>
<p> 
<i>The Right to Kill</i> follows the lives of six boys growing up on the north side of Syracuse, NY during the 1960s. They make a commitment one Saturday morning while watching Zorro, that like Zorro, they too will join together to protect their little patch of turf that surrounds Schiller Park. They proceed to, as they call it, ""clean up the neighborhood."" Their escapades begin with the calculated killing and intricate dissection of the lovelorn alley cats crying in the night, and the dismantling of the hippie community's annoying wind chimes incessantly ringing as the summer winds blow. While doing their best to <i>take care of business</i> and keep the backstreets clear of the unwanted, they soon find themselves in the clutches of a local serial killer.<br/></p>
<p>   As they mature into young men, and as a sure way to make money, they find themselves doing odd jobs for the local mafia. Their role playing and self-taught discipline allows them to commit to a few more untraceable executions along the way…of course, it's all for the betterment of the community. </p>
<p>   Wanting to stay true to their original cause of cleaning up the neighborhood, they set their sights not on governing the world, but managing the world's governing bodies. In the 1980's the United Sates' Republican Guard (the former GOP) decides to close the country's borders and immediately implement, <i>The Great Rebuild/Everything American</i>. Welfare is discontinued. Everyone <i>has</i> to work. No one is allowed in or out of America. All of the food and everything we Americans crave as a country is produced within our borders <i>by</i> Americans <i>for</i> Americans. No imports and no exports. The corrupt prison system is destroyed and so are the criminals housed inside. The majority of the world is astonished and in disbelief. Texas then implements <i>The Right to Kill Act. </i>Thanks to our main character, you can now petition for the legal right to kill someone. This changes everything.</p>

<h3>2015 QUARTER-FINALIST IN ""SCREENCRAFT"" <br/>
</h3>
<h3>SHORT FILM SCRIPT <br/>
</h3>
<h3>Raves:</h3>
<h4>“Bipolar &amp; Cheese is a fun and quirky offbeat comedy, tonally reminiscent of the humor found in 30 Rock and Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. The writer has a unique and original voice, a strong command of the screenplay format, and has a well-structured story with a very clear beginning, middle, and end. And the final reveal … was especially fun.” </h4>
<h4>“Perhaps most impressive was the fact that the author didn’t have to resort to “bathroom” humor in order to be funny. It’s nice to see someone who can generate laughs in a script through the use of situational, character-driven humor.” </h4>
<h3>
<br/>2010 QUARTER-FINALIST in “FRESH VOICES” <br/>
</h3>
<h3>Screenplay Competition</h3>
<h3>Raves:<br/>
</h3>
<h4>“This script is about a woman with bipolar disorder and brings a lot of much-needed attention to the underrepresented population of people with mood disorders.  She is presented in a very real and honest way, she is not the caricature “crazy person” we so often see in films.  I think this film promotes inclusion and understanding of people with conditions like these who are so often alienated in society.”</h4>
<h4>“Bipolar &amp; Cheese” highlights the issues of how society treats people with severe mood disorders (and mental illness in general).  “This writer does a great job of getting us to empathize with the character.  I think this film could help to make a positive difference in the way that the mentally ill are perceived and treated.”</h4>

<b>The</b> <b>Film</b>
</h1>
<p></p>Bipolar &amp; Cheese is a realistic journey of a person afflicted 
with mental illness, a topic that is rarely touched upon in American 
mainstream cinema.  This story will affect many people with 
and without Bipolar Disorder.
<span><b><br/><br/>Scarlet Perez's‪</b> first feature screenplay <b>“BIPOLAR &amp; </b></span><b>CHEESE”</b> has gained an exciting buzz, good reviews, and nominations from screenplay competitions. Bipolar &amp; Cheese was a quarter finalist in the Screenplay Competition <b>""Fresh Voices""</b> &amp; in the Short Film Competition, <b>""ScreenCraft""</b>  as well as an award nominee for <b>""Diversity &amp; Inclusion."" </b>This award promotes 
diversity and inclusion on screen. We spotlight screenplays where the

<b>The Film's Mission:</b>
</h1>

To stop the stigma of Mental Illness, as well as educate people who do 
not necessarily understand Bipolar Disorder, <br/>a sensitive topic that is 
misunderstood in the media. <br/><br/><h1><b>What is Bipolar Disorder?</b></h1>
<p>Bipolar disorder, formerly known as manic-depressive illness, is a 
brain disorder that causes unusual shifts in mood, energy, activity 
levels, and the ability to carry out day-to-day tasks.  Symptoms of 
Bipolar Disorder are severe.  They are different from the normal ups and
 downs that everyone goes through from time to time. People with 
Bipolar Disorder experience unusually intense emotional states that 
occur in distinct periods called ""mood episodes."" An overly joyful or 
overexcited state is called a Manic episode, and an extremely sad or 
hopeless state is called a Depressive episode.  Its symptoms can result 
in damaged relationships, poor job or school performance, and even 
suicide.  Bipolar Disorder is a life-long illness with no cure, but it 
can be treated, and people with this illness can lead full and 
productive lives.  Approximately 10 million people worldwide are 
diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder.  </p>

BIPOLAR & CHEESE 
provides a quirky look into the initial diagnosis triggered by love & cheese.

 





BIPOLAR & CHEESE

based on a true story, is a short film about a Therapist that 
discovers she has Bipolar Disorder after she publicly has a breakdown over a
 new co-worker whom she bonds with over 

cheese.

2015 QUARTER-FINALIST IN ""SCREENCRAFT"" 

SHORT FILM SCRIPT 

Raves:
“Bipolar & Cheese is a fun and quirky offbeat comedy, tonally reminiscent of the humor found in 30 Rock and Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. The writer has a unique and original voice, a strong command of the screenplay format, and has a well-structured story with a very clear beginning, middle, and end. And the final reveal … was especially fun.” 
“Perhaps most impressive was the fact that the author didn’t have to resort to “bathroom” humor in order to be funny. It’s nice to see someone who can generate laughs in a script through the use of situational, character-driven humor.” 

2010 QUARTER-FINALIST in “FRESH VOICES” 

Screenplay Competition
Raves:

“This script is about a woman with bipolar disorder and brings a lot of much-needed attention to the underrepresented population of people with mood disorders.  She is presented in a very real and honest way, she is not the caricature “crazy person” we so often see in films.  I think this film promotes inclusion and understanding of people with conditions like these who are so often alienated in society.”
“Bipolar & Cheese” highlights the issues of how society treats people with severe mood disorders (and mental illness in general).  “This writer does a great job of getting us to empathize with the character.  I think this film could help to make a positive difference in the way that the mentally ill are perceived and treated.”

***The first $250 funder gets TWO tickets to a Live Taping of THE BIG BANG THEORY in LA!***
 



Do you know anyone with Bipolar Disorder?  Do you like Cheese?
Bipolar
 & Cheese is a short film that touches on both.  It’s centered 
around romance and cheese ... and for some people, their romance with 
cheese.

The Film

Bipolar & Cheese is a realistic journey of a person afflicted 
with mental illness, a topic that is rarely touched upon in American 
mainstream cinema.  This story will affect many people with 
and without Bipolar Disorder.
Scarlet Perez's‪ first feature screenplay “BIPOLAR & CHEESE” has gained an exciting buzz, good reviews, and nominations from screenplay competitions. Bipolar & Cheese was a quarter finalist in the Screenplay Competition ""Fresh Voices"" & in the Short Film Competition, ""ScreenCraft""  as well as an award nominee for ""Diversity & Inclusion."" This award promotes 
diversity and inclusion on screen. We spotlight screenplays where the 
main character or a majority of characters are under represented in 
cinema.

We wanted to make a movie about how special and unique it is to have someone in your community dedicating their life to make everyone's day brighter. What ended up being captured in the movie was so much more...

We found that they changed people's live's, one interaction at a time. They each had their own unique style of greeting...but they all had the same goal; to make the world a better place. We also found that even in the face of opposition and ridicule, The Greeters persevered out of their love for humanity and their commitment to doing something meaningful to them.

This is the first documentary feature for our production company, Elestial Productions. We are interested in stories that raise our awareness and increase our connection to each other, our world and to the collective consciousness. The Greeters are an example of how one person can remind us that we are all connected and that we all have a role in creating the world we wish to live in.

You will help us achieve in this campaign what we cannot do by ourselves. We need your support to show how people some of us can affect all of us, just by being themselves.

We are excited to have as part of our team...

<p align=""justify"">MINDEPENDENCE is a cross-media project on media independence and
freedom of expression in countries where these values are at stake.
MINDEPENDENCE spans different countries and combines a variety
of online and offline outputs.</p>
<h3>Outputs</h3>
<p><b>Documentary series</b></p>
<p align=""justify"">MINDEPENDENCE core output is the production of a
documentary series available via the project’s website.
Each documentary takes place in a priority country, featuring
an independent media organization which is selected on the basis of its
uncompromising, socially engaged line of action.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Our protagonists are the people behind each organization.We
follow them in their everyday routine, we learn about their methods,
challenges and risks, we observe their interactions with other people, we
capture their moments of enthusiasm and frustration.
Through them, and through additional input provided by key
experts and other related informants, we intend to outline the wider
sociopolitical situation in each country.</p>
<p><b> Website</b></p>
<p align=""justify"">MINDEPENDENCE website will serve as the project's online diary, documenting the research process and filming in each country.</p>
<p align=""justify"">In addition it stands as a dynamic pool for knowledge, publishing original and existing material on the state of media independence with a bigger aim to establish a participatory tool, stimulating the active engagement of its community.</p>
<p><b>Live Events</b></p>
<p align=""justify"">MINDEPENDENCE wants to support real-time interaction and reflection in each priority country. We aim to achieve this through the documentaries' screenings and the organisation of open discussions and key note lectures on media independence and freedom of expression.</p>
<h3>The Cause</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1433198619/un0lqy81oeqvkgymdudb.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p align=""justify"">Media is constitutionally declared as the guarantor of pluralism and democracy. Yet, this is not always the case in many countries, even in those that pride themselves on being democracies and respecting the UN Plan of Action on the Safety of Journalists and Impunity (2012). While social media and citizen journalism gain significant ground over the last years, the space for independent media has been shrinking rapidly as a result of pressure from political and/or economic interests.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Past and recent events in different countries indicate that the “wrongdoings” go beyond mere misinformation or governmental regulation. In the name of a distorted interpretation of national security needs, we witness severe cases of civic rights infringements and abuse against journalists.</p>
<p align=""justify"">MINDEPENDENCE seeks to raise awareness and stimulate debate on such phenomena, supporting the idea that media independence and freedom of expression are integral ingredients for pluralistic, politically engaged and democratic societies.</p>
<h3>Objectives and Impact</h3>
<p align=""justify"">MINDEPENDENCE intends to showcase the sociopolitical specificities of media independence in priority countries by introducing daring media organizations and their efforts towards transparent, uncompromising, socially engaged journalism. Through MINDEPENDENCE, we aspire to achieve the following impact:</p>
<p align=""justify"">1.raise awareness on the methods, challenges and risks of practicing media independence.</p>
<p align=""justify"">2.facilitate cross-border exchange of practices and
challenges between media organizations.</p>
<p align=""justify"">3.empower young journalists, IT specialists and other independent experts with the values of pro-transparency and anti-corruption journalism.</p>
<p align=""justify"">4.establish a transnational community of engaged people who will actively contribute to MINDEPENDENCE upcoming activities.</p>
<h3>Director's Intention</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1433199448/hy0dyib6qy9aopwopiaw.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p align=""justify"">Violations of media independence and freedom of expression proliferate alarmingly, even in countries that define themselves as democracies. 
Such cases reach our door on a daily basis. They worry and repel and shock us.</p>
<p align=""justify"">But, have we ever thought what it actually takes to remain loyal to the values of independent, uncompromising, socially engaged journalism against all odds? Have we wondered who are the people that find this courage? What fuels them? How does their working reality look like? How are their lives affected by this commitment?</p>
<p align=""justify"">Following an anthropocentric approach, MINDEPENDENCE aspires to bring these people in the foreground.</p>
<h3>Documentary series: Development plan</h3>
<p align=""justify"">MINDEPENDENCE is currently in its development phase, with the aim to deliver its first three documentary episodes by June 2016.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Based on the occurrence of civic rights violations, state control, censorship and abuse against journalists, these episodes will take place in three different regions, featuring three diverse countries: Hungary, Turkey and Egypt.</p>
<p align=""justify"">We plan to shoot our first episode in Budapest, Hungary in September 2015 presenting independent, investigatory media organization Direkt36. The episode will premiere in Berlin, Budapest and Athens in December 2015 and shortly afterwards will be released online via the project’s website.</p>
<p align=""justify"">The next two episodes, currently in their research phase, are planned for January 2016 (Turkey, Istanbul) and March 2016 (Cairo, Egypt), while their release is respectively expected around April and June 2016.</p>
<h3>Episode 1: Hungary / Direkt36</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1433200920/pvos8z0ydknuyao1cezh.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p align=""justify"">Hungary has undergone a significant erosion of civil liberties, above all freedom of information, since Viktor Orbán was elected prime minister in 2010.</p>
<p align=""justify"">The Orbán government used its two-thirds majority in parliament to get a highly restrictive media law adopted in 2011. It introduced fines for the creators of content that is not “balanced” – a concept deliberately left vague – and established a dangerous media regulatory authority with statutory links to Fidesz, the conservative ruling party. This “Media Council” guaranteed just one thing – political interference in news and information content. The European Union subsequently managed to get the government to rescind some of its provisions but not the most draconian ones.</p>

<p align=""justify"">Direkt36 is a new investigative journalism center in Hungary with the mission to expose wrongdoings and abuse of power by producing stories based on tough questions and hard facts.</p>
<p align=""justify"">They provide the Hungarian and international audience with in-depth – often data-driven – accountability reporting that most of the Hungarian media outlets cannot afford. Direkt36 is not part of the competition of news organizations covering daily events, which allows them to use their resources to focus exclusively on conducting systematic investigations. With this unique approach, which proved to be successful in Western countries but has not taken roots in Hungary, they can highlight previously hidden problems of the society.</p>
<p align=""justify"">This is a very exciting work, a big challenge, but also indispensable for making Hungary a stronger and healthier democracy. Many stories have international implications and are published in English as well. Their ambition is to become an active contributor to the work of the growing network of investigative centers in the region and around the world.</p>

<p align=""justify"">András spent much of his 12-year-long journalism career at Origo, with some longer stints abroad. He worked for 15 months for the BBC World Service and did two journalism fellowships in the United States. In 2013 he spent 8 months with the investigative unit of The Washington Post where he learned data-mining and reporting methods from some of the world’s best journalists. He is the only journalist who was given two times the Soma Award, the prestigious annual award dedicated to investigative journalism in Hungary. He also received the Quality Journalism Award three times.</p>
<p align=""justify"">As Direkt36’s editor and reporter, his focus is corruption and public spending. He is especially interested in the links between politics and business, the activities of influential people in this often grey zone.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1433242729/zgg0lx9ur6tsf6qsmqml.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p align=""justify"">He spent the 12 years of his entire career at Origo, a major news portal in Hungary. He started as a reporter and rose to the position of editor-in-chief, while trying himself in nearly every field of journalism. He was in the thick of many breaking news situations, and experimented a lot with storytelling and technical innovations. He also worked on several award-winning articles as an editor, and gave the initial thrust to many of his colleagues who later became well-known journalists.</p>
<p align=""justify"">His goal at Direkt36 is to be able to work as a journalist without any compromise, to deliver unbiased stories to the audience and to remind the powerful that they are being watched.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1433242762/vu2utvpwincuijrye880.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p align=""justify"">Balázs was the founder and longest-serving editor-in-chief of Origo. He led the team that made Origo the largest news-portal in Hungary. He was also a personal guarantee for the famously high professional and ethical standards at the news-portal. Since leaving Origo in 2011 he has been teaching at various universities and training programs in Hungary and abroad. He is also the chairman of the Editor-in-chiefs’ Forum, an organization aiming to improve the ethical standards in journalism in Hungary.</p>
<p align=""justify"">His focus in Direkt36 is that of the supervising editor, who reads the articles through with a strictly critical eye, looking for missing links and holes in the stories, measures risks, be them legal or ethical, and always calls out for more proof desperately.</p>

<h3>Risks and Challenges</h3>
<p align=""justify"">MINDEPENDENCE highlights positive examples of media independence and the challenges they encounter while committed to their values. Nevertheless, our project team is well aware it’s entering a complicated, demanding and possibly risky field. The risk factor is not equally present in all countries, varying from a restrictive environment of managed news propaganda and censorship to severe cases of harassment, imprisonment or even assassination of journalists.</p>
<p align=""justify"">We will therefore exhaust all means available in order to eliminate risks for the people involved in this endeavor, both as crew or journalists/experts exposing their opinions in public. In this respect, we will take the following steps:</p>
<p align=""justify"">1.examine the situation of media independence in each country with the facilitation of experts, and ask for legal advice if required</p>
<p align=""justify"">2.identify and recruit local coordinators with a strong background on the matter, in order to guide us safely through the local framework.</p>
<p align=""justify"">3.maintain a transparent and direct attitude towards our informants, advising them of the project’s objectives and outputs.</p>
<p align=""justify"">4.respect and safeguard informants’ wish for anonymity when requested.</p>
<p align=""justify"">5.preview each episode with the team and core members of the respective media organization, to secure that the documentary does not jeopardize their public image.</p>
<p align=""justify"">6.hold internal screenings in affiliated contexts to receive feedback and suggestions from engaged communities.</p>

MINDEPENDENCE is a cross-media project on media independence and
freedom of expression in countries where these values are at stake.
MINDEPENDENCE spans different countries and combines a variety
of online and offline outputs.
Outputs
Documentary series
MINDEPENDENCE core output is the production of a
documentary series available via the project’s website.
Each documentary takes place in a priority country, featuring
an independent media organization which is selected on the basis of its
uncompromising, socially engaged line of action.
Our protagonists are the people behind each organization.We
follow them in their everyday routine, we learn about their methods,
challenges and risks, we observe their interactions with other people, we
capture their moments of enthusiasm and frustration.
Through them, and through additional input provided by key
experts and other related informants, we intend to outline the wider
sociopolitical situation in each country.
 Website
MINDEPENDENCE website will serve as the project's online diary, documenting the research process and filming in each country.
In addition it stands as a dynamic pool for knowledge, publishing original and existing material on the state of media independence with a bigger aim to establish a participatory tool, stimulating the active engagement of its community.
Live Events
MINDEPENDENCE wants to support real-time interaction and reflection in each priority country. We aim to achieve this through the documentaries' screenings and the organisation of open discussions and key note lectures on media independence and freedom of expression.
The Cause

Media is constitutionally declared as the guarantor of pluralism and democracy. Yet, this is not always the case in many countries, even in those that pride themselves on being democracies and respecting the UN Plan of Action on the Safety of Journalists and Impunity (2012). While social media and citizen journalism gain significant ground over the last years, the space for independent media has been shrinking rapidly as a result of pressure from political and/or economic interests.
Past and recent events in different countries indicate that the “wrongdoings” go beyond mere misinformation or governmental regulation. In the name of a distorted interpretation of national security needs, we witness severe cases of civic rights infringements and abuse against journalists.
MINDEPENDENCE seeks to raise awareness and stimulate debate on such phenomena, supporting the idea that media independence and freedom of expression are integral ingredients for pluralistic, politically engaged and democratic societies.
Objectives and Impact
MINDEPENDENCE intends to showcase the sociopolitical specificities of media independence in priority countries by introducing daring media organizations and their efforts towards transparent, uncompromising, socially engaged journalism. Through MINDEPENDENCE, we aspire to achieve the following impact:
1.raise awareness on the methods, challenges and risks of practicing media independence.
2.facilitate cross-border exchange of practices and
challenges between media organizations.
3.empower young journalists, IT specialists and other independent experts with the values of pro-transparency and anti-corruption journalism.
4.establish a transnational community of engaged people who will actively contribute to MINDEPENDENCE upcoming activities.
Director's Intention

Violations of media independence and freedom of expression proliferate alarmingly, even in countries that define themselves as democracies. 
Such cases reach our door on a daily basis. They worry and repel and shock us.
But, have we ever thought what it actually takes to remain loyal to the values of independent, uncompromising, socially engaged journalism against all odds? Have we wondered who are the people that find this courage? What fuels them? How does their working reality look like? How are their lives affected by this commitment?
Following an anthropocentric approach, MINDEPENDENCE aspires to bring these people in the foreground.
Documentary series: Development plan
MINDEPENDENCE is currently in its development phase, with the aim to deliver its first three documentary episodes by June 2016.
Based on the occurrence of civic rights violations, state control, censorship and abuse against journalists, these episodes will take place in three different regions, featuring three diverse countries: Hungary, Turkey and Egypt.
We plan to shoot our first episode in Budapest, Hungary in September 2015 presenting independent, investigatory media organization Direkt36. The episode will premiere in Berlin, Budapest and Athens in December 2015 and shortly afterwards will be released online via the project’s website.
The next two episodes, currently in their research phase, are planned for January 2016 (Turkey, Istanbul) and March 2016 (Cairo, Egypt), while their release is respectively expected around April and June 2016.
Episode 1: Hungary / Direkt36

Hungary has undergone a significant erosion of civil liberties, above all freedom of information, since Viktor Orbán was elected prime minister in 2010.
The Orbán government used its two-thirds majority in parliament to get a highly restrictive media law adopted in 2011. It introduced fines for the creators of content that is not “balanced” – a concept deliberately left vague – and established a dangerous media regulatory authority with statutory links to Fidesz, the conservative ruling party. This “Media Council” guaranteed just one thing – political interference in news and information content. The European Union subsequently managed to get the government to rescind some of its provisions but not the most draconian ones.
Source: Reporters without Borders

Direkt36 is a new investigative journalism center in Hungary with the mission to expose wrongdoings and abuse of power by producing stories based on tough questions and hard facts.
They provide the Hungarian and international audience with in-depth – often data-driven – accountability reporting that most of the Hungarian media outlets cannot afford. Direkt36 is not part of the competition of news organizations covering daily events, which allows them to use their resources to focus exclusively on conducting systematic investigations. With this unique approach, which proved to be successful in Western countries but has not taken roots in Hungary, they can highlight previously hidden problems of the society.
This is a very exciting work, a big challenge, but also indispensable for making Hungary a stronger and healthier democracy. Many stories have international implications and are published in English as well. Their ambition is to become an active contributor to the work of the growing network of investigative centers in the region and around the world.
Direkt36

András spent much of his 12-year-long journalism career at Origo, with some longer stints abroad. He worked for 15 months for the BBC World Service and did two journalism fellowships in the United States. In 2013 he spent 8 months with the investigative unit of The Washington Post where he learned data-mining and reporting methods from some of the world’s best journalists. He is the only journalist who was given two times the Soma Award, the prestigious annual award dedicated to investigative journalism in Hungary. He also received the Quality Journalism Award three times.
As Direkt36’s editor and reporter, his focus is corruption and public spending. He is especially interested in the links between politics and business, the activities of influential people in this often grey zone.

He spent the 12 years of his entire career at Origo, a major news portal in Hungary. He started as a reporter and rose to the position of editor-in-chief, while trying himself in nearly every field of journalism. He was in the thick of many breaking news situations, and experimented a lot with storytelling and technical innovations. He also worked on several award-winning articles as an editor, and gave the initial thrust to many of his colleagues who later became well-known journalists.
His goal at Direkt36 is to be able to work as a journalist without any compromise, to deliver unbiased stories to the audience and to remind the powerful that they are being watched.

Balázs was the founder and longest-serving editor-in-chief of Origo. He led the team that made Origo the largest news-portal in Hungary. He was also a personal guarantee for the famously high professional and ethical standards at the news-portal. Since leaving Origo in 2011 he has been teaching at various universities and training programs in Hungary and abroad. He is also the chairman of the Editor-in-chiefs’ Forum, an organization aiming to improve the ethical standards in journalism in Hungary.
His focus in Direkt36 is that of the supervising editor, who reads the articles through with a strictly critical eye, looking for missing links and holes in the stories, measures risks, be them legal or ethical, and always calls out for more proof desperately.
Next Episodes

 While developing MINDEPENDENCE, we came up with a shortlist of 12 priority countries for the first round of our documentary series. This shortlist was formed on a representative basis, including 4 regions: Eastern Europe, The Balkans, North Africa and Middle East.

The number next to each country indicates their ranking by the Reporters Without Borders for their status of media freedom and freedom of information in 2014 (you can find a global overview of 2014 World Press Freedom Index here).
In this context, we would like to encourage you to reflect on the next documentaries. Please, send us an email  with the indication “MINDEPENDENCE – My Priority Country”, stating which country you feel should be featured in the upcoming episodes.  Let us also know about encouraging cases of independent media organizations. And if you feel you can contribute to the project in any active way, write us a few lines about yourself!
Risks and Challenges
MINDEPENDENCE highlights positive examples of media independence and the challenges they encounter while committed to their values. Nevertheless, our project team is well aware it’s entering a complicated, demanding and possibly risky field. The risk factor is not equally present in all countries, varying from a restrictive environment of managed news propaganda and censorship to severe cases of harassment, imprisonment or even assassination of journalists.
We will therefore exhaust all means available in order to eliminate risks for the people involved in this endeavor, both as crew or journalists/experts exposing their opinions in public. In this respect, we will take the following steps:
1.examine the situation of media independence in each country with the facilitation of experts, and ask for legal advice if required
2.identify and recruit local coordinators with a strong background on the matter, in order to guide us safely through the local framework.
3.maintain a transparent and direct attitude towards our informants, advising them of the project’s objectives and outputs.
4.respect and safeguard informants’ wish for anonymity when requested.
5.preview each episode with the team and core members of the respective media organization, to secure that the documentary does not jeopardize their public image.
6.hold internal screenings in affiliated contexts to receive feedback and suggestions from engaged communities.

Editorial pressure from political leaders and private owners lead to self-censorship, attacks on journalists that went unpunished were just some of the products of the rotten political systems. Mindependence reminds us that freedom of media is not the given right, but the one we should always fight for”.
Hanja Marovic, journalist, Voice of the Balkans project

""We live in a time when media companies and their journalists are quickly losing ground: they face growing pressure, enormous financial and legal struggles and they have to redefine their work and role in the society. While the space for independent media is shrinking, people easily forget that the free flow of information is vital for a democracy, just like the oxygen for the human body. Mindependence is here to remind us this fact and to shed light on a possible future of cross-border in-depth journalism.""
Direkt36

""The topic of media freedom becomes more and more important every day, as we can see an increase in the intimidation of journalists and other measures that lead to limited press freedom and threaten journalists because of their work in Europe and elsewhere. A free press forms the core of a democratic society that respects human rights and everyone's right of access to information. With her groundbreaking project Martha Bouziouri and MINDEPENDENCE are continuing a
discussion that we hope will never be silenced.""
Anna Saraste, Member of Executive Board, European Youth Press

""The independence and freedom of the media is at the basis of a lively democracy and a just society. Grassroots and new organisations are an increasingly important aspect of any open media landscape. In times of retrenching rights and authoritarian tendencies in many parts of Europe, this is very an essential and timely project.""
Lorenzo Marsili, director of European Alternatives, spokesperson of European Media Initiative for Media Pluralism

""MINDEPENDENCE gives us a vivid idea of the difficult conditions under which independent media organizations also in Europe fight for uncensored news coverage. The Ernst Schering Foundation supports the project, since freedom of the press is something that needs to be defended every day. It is the essential condition for enabling us to freely form an opinion. Please join us in supporting the project!""
Heike Catherina Mertens, Director of Ernst Schering Foundation

ANEW Community Institute helps people in the community to become self sufficient and to participate in helping others.We are renovating this house, which was abandoned for 15 years, and turning it into affordable housing for a homeless veteran, a community drop in center that will provide financial literacy and life skills training,  and a community coffeehouse. But the first ten days, we are concentrating on providing an affordable home for a homeless veteran and his spouse. Please Help! This Homeless Vet and his Spouse need our help now! There is a four room apartment on the third floor of the Baker House that we are renovating so that they can move in! They are helping with the work, and they want to help others when they are settled. If you help us, you will be providing a home for a veteran, and then we will work with him to help him build his future as a community leader over the long term.     We Need Your Help! ANEW Community Institute has many projects going, such as hosting a huge Jazz and Arts Festival, providing arts programming to the community, helping community members start their own mall businesses, running a print shop and publishing house, and training low income young people for careers in home renovation- carpentry, plumbing, and electrical.   Right now, we are in need of  $5000.00 for supplies for the renovation of our community help center,  meals for volunteers, and transportation to the site.  Donors will be invited to the VIP Grand Opening Celebration! 
Some of our perks include: 
$1,000 or more: A Season Pass to All Our Arts and Music Events.
$500 to $999: Entry to the VIP Meet the Artists Dinner 
$100 to $500: Tickets to see one of our music performances
Under $100: a photograph in front of the Baker House, autographed by our Veteran, who will no longer be homeless BECAUSE of YOU! and free coffee for a month from our coffeehouse. Every penny we raise will go to the renovation of the Baker House!    The Impact You can feel proud of the difference your contribution will make:  There should not be any American Veterans who are HOMELESS! Your contribution will be a jumpstart to the civilian life of a soldier who deserves to be honored, not ignored!
 Our track record is amazing for a community nonprofit  that receives no government or big foundation money. All our contributors are people from the community who care about the work we do.  We have saved families' homes from tax sales and foreclosures, helped negotiate debt into affordable payment plans, raised money for fire victims in Homestead and Wilkinsburg, helped families find housing, and provided life skills and job training for many youth and hard to employ adults. The Baker House will be the center of our day to day operations in the community and provide a place for people in transition to get the help they need. And the beauty of our program is that we turn those we help into volunteers who then help the next person in need! A dollar given to our organization can help many more because we keep passing the blessing forward!

 
Good News!Our Homeless Veteran was just offered a JOB! He needs to be in his new home right away.  Imagine how hard it must be to get up on time and get ready for work as a homeless veteran. Bathing, getting breakfast, clean clothes, tooth-brushing, all the things we take for granted, things that should be easy, become challenges. Please help today!     Other Ways You Can Help If you can't contribute financially, that doesn't mean you can't help:
You can help by getting the word out and making some noise about our campaign- share it on Facebook, email it to your friends, ask people to help us!

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">I’m thrilled to serve as an ambassador for the <b>SOSAJI! Legacy Campaign</b>, a unique, sock-centric effort to promote a spirit of giving, gumption, and goodwill that will benefit various nonprofit organizations.

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">I inherited an appreciation for fast cars from my father. My first car was an $850 Fiat Abarth that we had to tow home, where the real magic happened: me and my dad working on that car all day--rebuilding the engine, painting, transforming it into something special. Each moment we spent fixing it up, as with everything else we did together, we were  creating the best memories of my life. We were close back then, as we are now--but now my dad has cancer. </span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">My mom is an eighteen-year survivor of breast cancer. My older sister had and beat cancer. My younger sister has breast cancer, which has now spread into her lungs. My grandfather on my mom’s side had cancer.  </span></p>
</div></span><span style=""line-height: 26px; font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal;"">I am intimately aware of the devastating affects of cancer, and so is Gilda’s Club Louisville, which is an organization dedicated to serving cancer patients and their family and friends. </span>

</div></div>","Dear Friend, 
I’m thrilled to serve as an ambassador for the SOSAJI! Legacy Campaign, a unique, sock-centric effort to promote a spirit of giving, gumption, and goodwill that will benefit various nonprofit organizations. As an ambassador, I have a wonderful opportunity to choose one of the nonprofit organizations that will benefit from this campaign, and I choose Gilda’s Club Louisville.
My Inspiration
I inherited an appreciation for fast cars from my father. My first car was an $850 Fiat Abarth that we had to tow home, where the real magic happened: me and my dad working on that car all day--rebuilding the engine, painting, transforming it into something special. Each moment we spent fixing it up, as with everything else we did together, we were  creating the best memories of my life. We were close back then, as we are now--but now my dad has cancer. 
My mom is an eighteen-year survivor of breast cancer. My older sister had and beat cancer. My younger sister has breast cancer, which has now spread into her lungs. My grandfather on my mom’s side had cancer.  
I am intimately aware of the devastating affects of cancer, and so is Gilda’s Club Louisville, which is an organization dedicated to serving cancer patients and their family and friends. 


Please join me and SOSAJI! in this worthwhile effort to build a legacy of giving, gumption, and goodwill. Make a contribution. Make a difference. 
Sincerely,


George Woodrow Hippler, III


The Process



1. Awesome people like you contribute to the campaign until it's fully funded. We need at least $5,000 to cover production, packaging/labeling, and shipping costs.  
2. SOSAJI! produces about 2,000 pairs of socks bearing one of the winning designs from the  SOSAJI! Design-A-Sock Contest.
3. SOSAJI! sells the socks and the designated nonprofits receives 10% to 18% of the proceeds until the socks sell out--a potential gift of over $10,000, collectively. The greater of the two percentages goes to nonprofits who choose to partner with SOSAJ!.
4. Once the initial collection of socks sells out, SOSAJI! produces four additional designs that continue to benefit the designated nonprofit organization.



The Perks

Contribute $25 or more: receive 1 PAIR of socks
Contribute $50 or more: receive 2 PAIRS of socks
Contribute $100 or more: receive 3 PAIRS of socks.



Contribute $200 or more: receive 4 PAIRS of SOSAJI! Legacy Socks, AND we'll record our groovy gratitude Happy Dance dance moves and post them online just for you

Contribute $500 or more: receive 10 PAIRS of SOSAJI! Legacy Socks, AND an opportunity to be on the SOSAJI! Design Team

This is not about you giving us money! it’s about a community coming together to acquire the stuff we need, to bring these stories to life.
In a nut-shell...  My name is Jovan Thomas. I am a filmmaker born, and raised in Los Angeles, Ca, in 1990. I've been acting for about three years, and began writing and directing my own materials as of last year.  This campaign is to help fund my dreams! kinda. It will help me get my feet off the ground and shoot a professional quality television show/pilot. With your help we can fund a project that would take myself years to gather up, if ever. This will be the beginning of a beautiful journey and I would love your help.
   What We Need & What You Get Here's a breakdown:  I'm only asking for a cup of coffee. That's right. $5! If each person I know can donate that small amount, then i can reach the goal in no time! (unless you want to be awesome and give more, I won't stop you)
The goal we are trying to reach would fund the first three episodes of the series, including the opening sequence.

If the funds are raised, we would use $1500 for each episode, $1000 for the opening sequence, and remaining $500 for other essential items.   

In comparison, big budget pilots are much more expensive than what i'm asking here. The average cost of a half-hour comedy pilot is $2 million, while a drama costs about $5.5 million, just to shoot. (I only need a few grand)

However, if you are interesting to support further plugin development, I would be happy to continue my work for some time. I analyzed users ideas and selected the one, which can be implemented within one month and bring new breath to old N64 titles.

Thus, this work must be done almost from scratch.</p><h1>Plan for Project Completion</h1><p>While DolphinFX is already written and Dolphin emulator has all necessary code to support it, porting of that code to GLideN64 will not be easy. I can separate that task on three large parts:</p><p>·  Port load shader functionality: read shader file, parse its configuration section</p><p>·  Port setup shader functionality: activate selected effects, provide values for their options.</p><p>·  Implement dynamic generation of User Interface for available effects.</p><p>I plan to finish Android port works this May.

However, it is interesting task and I am ready to risk if you will support me. If campaign will reach the goal, I will do my best to add DolphinFX support to GLideN64 as soon as possible. Note: this project is NOT Fixed Funding. If collected sum will be less than the goal, but not less than 50%, it will allow me to continue my work on the project for few weeks. There are plenty of tasks to do. May be collected sum will be enough to take another ambitious task to implement. Resident Evil 2 is waiting for support :) If the campaign will be super successful and exceed the goal,  all extra funds also will go on further project development.

<p>In New York City, West Harlem is at this moment the most exciting
place to open our cocktail lounge - a dream we’ve entertained
for a long time.  With many years of experience in the New
York bar &amp; restaurant world, we are ready
to open a place of our very own. In fact, we have found our ideal space at the heart of West Harlem and are currently negotiating the lease.  Now is
the perfect time to jump wholeheartedly into
this thrilling venture.  </p>
<p>Your help is crucial to the realization of this project.  We
aim to raise approximately $50,000 to cover legal fees, liquor
license, design, lease acquisition &amp; security deposit,
architect’s fee, and construction permits; a successful
campaign and global response will create a terrific buzz to
excite investors and complete our funding.</p>
<p>We thank you in advance for your help – we appreciate the
confidence you have placed in us. Here's to creating <b>art in a
glass</b>!</p>

<p>Harlem today is culturally richer, more diverse and hip than ever
before – its neighborhoods never so sought-after by visitors since
the Harlem Renaissance. This is Harlem's comeback, full of flavors
and surprises.</p>
<p>We have a vision of a forward-thinking and sophisticated place
where neighborhood residents, cocktail aficionados, foreign visitors,
and the arts community will all gather. <b>At Sugar Monk, art will
meet mixology.</b> <br/></p>
<p> Binikos’ ingenious art cocktails are created
from the most unusual elements and thrill the most discerning

finest spirits, and an array of artisanal bitters, infusions, and
extracts, all beautifully presented.</p>

Ektoras Binikos, mixologist and artist; Simon
Jutras, commercial photographer and designer of interiors
& furniture. 
Together we will operate Sugar Monk (in West
Harlem, NYC), an intimate venue where art, mixology, and alchemy
will combine to transcend the senses and elate the most
discriminating palates. Our creative and entrepreneurial 
backgrounds, enhanced by two decades of immersion in New York's art community, 
have so far resulted in award-winning mixology programs for some of NYC's finest 
establishments, and a successful photography & design portfolio with many 
notable clients. This is a very special moment in Harlem's history, and the 
perfect time to open Sugar Monk.

Your help is crucial to the realization of our project. Your contributions will defray the initial costs related to opening our space and the buzz from this campaign will propel further funding. 
Our goals and how you can help


In New York City, West Harlem is at this moment the most exciting
place to open our cocktail lounge - a dream we’ve entertained
for a long time.  With many years of experience in the New
York bar & restaurant world, we are ready
to open a place of our very own. In fact, we have found our ideal space at the heart of West Harlem and are currently negotiating the lease.  Now is
the perfect time to jump wholeheartedly into
this thrilling venture.  
Your help is crucial to the realization of this project.  We
aim to raise approximately $50,000 to cover legal fees, liquor
license, design, lease acquisition & security deposit,
architect’s fee, and construction permits; a successful
campaign and global response will create a terrific buzz to
excite investors and complete our funding.
We thank you in advance for your help – we appreciate the
confidence you have placed in us. Here's to creating art in a
glass!

The Impact


Harlem today is culturally richer, more diverse and hip than ever
before – its neighborhoods never so sought-after by visitors since
the Harlem Renaissance. This is Harlem's comeback, full of flavors
and surprises.
We have a vision of a forward-thinking and sophisticated place
where neighborhood residents, cocktail aficionados, foreign visitors,
and the arts community will all gather. At Sugar Monk, art will
meet mixology. 
 Binikos’ ingenious art cocktails are created
from the most unusual elements and thrill the most discerning
palates. The drinks will be made with the freshest ingredients, the
finest spirits, and an array of artisanal bitters, infusions, and
extracts, all beautifully presented.



The
rich sensory experience of exquisite cocktails and warm, splendid
art-filled surroundings with eclectic music will assure a magical
evening. 
We are very excited to join Harlem’s vibrant and historical
community alongside local legends such as The Apollo Theater,
Studio Museum of Harlem, Minton's, Sylvia’s, and The Schomburg
Center. Harlem is a unique and culturally rich neighborhood and
we are honored to be a part of it, as both residents and business
owners.

did not have many years of experience behind us.  Having managed
and built other people's businesses over the years, we have acquired
the tools to meet any challenges.  Our management skills,
enthusiasm, creativity, and passion, combined with our artistic
sensibilities, will help us create a unique gathering place where
alchemy and art offer a transcendent experience for its guests.

<p>The Card Wars is a Star Wars fan film/web series that takes
you inside an office environment who’s culture and politics are influence by
the Star Wars Card Trader mobile app.   You may be asking yourself what is the Star
Wars Card Trader app, but like Darth Trader said in the video above you are
asking  the wrong question.   </p>
<p>All of us Star Wars fans can't wait until December right, but what will we do with our time and how do you plan for THE EVENT?  I wanted to bring a funny and witty parody of Star Wars: A
New Hope if it took place on Earth  in a working office where the Executives (The Empire)
were the kids that grew up on Star Wars and of course the fresh out of college
employees (Rebel Alliance) would have been kids of those kids so the Star Wars
culture would have been ingrained in them and good chances are they were
influenced by the names they were given. 
Then to introduce a mobile card trading game that has such a fun and
dedicated fan base (and great stories I tell you visit the fan feed on any
release and be prepared to laugh a lot) and to make the SWCT the main reason
why things are done in the company.  All these shenanigans happening that will lead our characters up the premiere of Episode VII: The Force Awakens.</p>

<h3><b>Why this project?</b></h3>
<div>This project is important to us on many levels:</div>
<ul>
<li>We are passionate about <b>honest</b>, <b>authentic</b> storytelling in a landscape where violence, explosions, &amp; gratuitous sex rule (Not that we don't love those things. We just want to see stories that connect to people on a deeper level too)</li>
<li>
<b>No on is alone</b>. It's easy to feel lost, confused &amp; uncertain when faced with major life changes. We want to start a conversation about hard life things that we all deal with on a daily basis.</li>

For some happiness means a family. For some it means achievement and success. For some, happiness is the freedom to choose how to live life. For some, it is “having it all.”
What if your relationship was at odds with your version of true happiness? Would you say goodbye? How do you say goodbye to someone or even something you deeply love?

All I Want is a truly collaborative ensemble feature film that explores family, friendship, love and letting go.


The Story:

In their ten years of marriage, Mel and Drew have made themselves and their home the center of a tight circle of friends, who are treated like members of their own family.
Tonight, this bond is tested, and things will change forever when Mel and Drew announce the real reason for this celebration.
Ten years of marriage is caught, suddenly, in the glimpse of one evening.

The Team:


Melissa Center is the creator of this madness. She is also playing Mel. Melissa is the creator of web series Missed Connections Live. You can see her on Grimm, Grey's Anatomy, and True Detective. www.melissacenter.com

West Liang is a co-writer/co-director, actor & all around co-conspirator. His award-nominated feature film, Someone I Used to Know was produced by 408 Films (Linsanity) in 2011/12 and and is now available on Amazon. www.westliang.com
Ruben O'Malley is a D.P. who's credits include Jeff Lipsky's Twelve Thirty, award winning documentary Showfolk, and the recent Marc Meyer’s film How He Fell in Love with Matt McGorry and Amy Hargreaves as star crossed lovers. 

Ensemble of Actors who've inspired this story
You can see these fabulous people in Masters of Sex, Power, American Sniper, Love Thy Neighbor, Grey's Anatomy, NCIS & More!

   



Why this project?
This project is important to us on many levels:

We are passionate about honest, authentic storytelling in a landscape where violence, explosions, & gratuitous sex rule (Not that we don't love those things. We just want to see stories that connect to people on a deeper level too)

No on is alone. It's easy to feel lost, confused & uncertain when faced with major life changes. We want to start a conversation about hard life things that we all deal with on a daily basis.

LA is cooler than you think. We want to draw attention to the LA you don't typically hear or read about. We are collaborating with some local small business by weaving them into our story. Already, Bon Vivant, an Atwater Village market/cafe has said ""YES"" to partnering with us! 
Diversity matters. We want to represent a cross-section of REAL PEOPLE that happen to be black, white, male, female, hispanic, asian, gay, & straight in a way that is truthful. 
Fuck Hollywood. Statistics show those holding executive positions at TV studios are 96 percent white and 71 percent male, and the executives at film studios are 94 percent white and 100 percent male. This is an opportunity for us to take matters into our own hands and change the conversation about what can/can't get made.

<p>The <b>Rangjung Prison Dharma Project</b> is the only program that brings engaged meditation practice to both the inmate population and correction officers at Rikers Island Correctional Facility.  <br/></p>
<p>We operate as part of <i>New York Tsurphu Goshir Dharma Center</i>, a 501(c)3 non-profit Buddhist temple in Brooklyn, New York, which is organized around the basic principle of trying to allow others a way to settle into their own experience of wholeness, peace and connection to the world through meditation.  <br/></p>We began this work in April 2014 initially offering meditation instruction, meditation sessions and discussion groups to the <b>female inmate population </b>at Rikers.  Not long afterwards we were approached by the warden of a maximum security facility to offer weekly meditation for the <b>Correction Officers </b>as a way to help them cope with the difficult and unpredictable nature of their work as well as learn how to develop mindfulness when difficult emotions arise so that clear decisions are more easily made.  <br/><br/>Based upon the success of our work with the Correction Officers and the new changes that the Department of Correction has been instituting, we also now work with the <b>incarcerated adolescent population, the male population in a maximum security facility, </b>as well as one of the new <b>Enhanced Security Housing units which serves as an alternative to solitary confinement </b>for inmates involved in violent attacks while incarcerated.  <b>This funding will allow us to expand our services to a new facility for young adults as well as a new transgender program.<br/><br/></b>Our work is aimed at allowing all we serve, inmates <i>and</i> officers, to experience a break from the difficulties they face at Rikers through meditation as it relates to stress reduction, settling into one's own sense of dignity, and exploring what underlying thoughts and feelings are alive for them in that moment.<br/><br/>We are all volunteers and are not compensated at all for this work, and given the strength of the partnership we have with the Department of Correction we are trying to raise funds to help us expand in a healthy way that allows us to continue providing compassionate care to people who find themselves in very difficult, challenging situations.<br/><br/>Your donation will not only help keep our program running, it will help us with the important work of training new volunteers and allow us to meet the growing demand of our services at Rikers.<br/><br/><b><br/><br/></b><h2><b>Some of our volunteers:</b></h2>

<h2>How our work makes a difference:<br/>
</h2>
<p><br/>The impact of our work at Rikers has been felt by many, from inmates to correction officers and to the commissioner of the Department of Correction.  Here are a few testimonies:
</p>
<b>""<i>The
 Rangjung Prison Dharma Project has a working-relationship with the 
Department since April, 2014. The Rangjung Prison Dharma Project 
provides meditation classes and emotional
 support to the incarcerated population and uniform staff and is the 
only one of this kind on Rikers Island. The team helps the incarcerated 
population explore and gain insight about the effects of negative 
thoughts and feelings and their response to them,
 some of which might have contributed to their incarceration. In 
addition to services provided to the incarcerated population, the team 
work with Correction Officers to manage stress, anxiety and exhaustion.  
 We look forward to continuing this highly productive
 relationship with the Rangjung Prison Dharma Project and encourage 
their efforts
on Rikers Island.</i>"" <br/><br/>-Department of Correction<br/><br/></b>To date we have served over 2,000 inmates and over 200 correction officers, and we have been asked to increase our services to reach a larger swath of the 8,000 to 10,000 inmates who are detained at Rikers at any given point in time.<br/><br/><b>""<i>Coming to meditation is the only way that I can deal with the anxiety that I feel as I wait for sentencing.</i>""<br/><br/><i>Inmate</i></b><br/><b><br/></b>It is not uncommon for inmates to be detained at Rikers for as long as five years while waiting for sentencing.  During this long period of time inmates struggle with a wide range of difficult emotions, ranging from sadness to anxiety, depression, anger, rage, and loneliness.  We provide vital support to help inmates cope with being incarcerated and the effects that incarceration have on all of the spheres of their lives and relationships.<br/><br/>
<p><b><i>""Since I've been here, I've been separated from my family and my baby 
boy.  I am reminded every day about what I did that put me here and took
 me away from what I should be doing: taking care of my son. Meditation 
helps me see how I'm feeling and see some of the ways I made mistakes 
through my reactions.""</i></b></p>
<b>
</b><p><b><i>Inmate</i></b></p>
<p>Part of your donation will help us to develop a support program that will continue the benefit of the deep connections that we make with inmates while they are incarcerated. These benefits of being heard, supported, witnessed, and enriched through the contemplative support of meditation practice can continue as inmates make the adjustment to re-entry after release from incarceration.<i><br/></i></p>
<p><i><br/></i></p>
<p><b><i>""This is a very stressful place.  No one wants to be here.  But we are. 
 Meditation makes me feel peaceful.  I feel that even here, in jail, I 
can really feel who I am."" <br/></i></b>
</p>
<p><b><i>Inmate</i></b><br/></p>
<p>Part of the stress of being incarcerated often includes feeling written-off by friends, family, and society at large.  A large part of what we do in addition to offering meditation is offering supportive conversation and dialogue as a way of exploring what makes those we serve feel whole, empowered and cared-for.</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>""<i>Before I began meditating I felt closed to the world around me and my fellow officers.  Now I understand how the stress of this job and the constant exposure to violence had been affecting me both while on tour and at home.  Now I feel more in control of how I react to my surroundings.</i>""</b></p>
<p><b><i>Correction Officer</i></b></p>
<p>There are an estimated 8,000 Correction Officers who work at Rikers performing tours between the 10 jail buildings on the island, transporting inmates to various court buildings for trial as well as to other locations.  Their jobs are stressful, unpredictable and often involve the threat of having to deal with violence on a daily basis, or being assaulted while on the job.  We currently provide meditation and emotional/contemplative support at one maximum security facility on the island.  Your donation will allow us to be able to provide needed support to the brave women and men who work under circumstances that most of us could not.<br/>
</p>
<br/><br/><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p><br/></p>
<p>We recognize that some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help.  Help us by spreading the word about our campaign, use the share tools, use facebook, twitter, or regular email.  <br/></p>

  What We Need & What You Get We are seeking your support to help us continue our work and increase the impact of our successful program.
Raising $30,000 will to help us in the following ways:

 Create a one-day a week paid position for two of our volunteers so that they can manage and coordinate our growing number of volunteers and maintain relationships with Department of Correction staff on Riker's Island.
Develop and print educational materials to further support inmates and officers.
Develop a support program for inmates after they are released from jail to continue meditation practice as well as the therapeutic relationships formed with our volunteers.
Increase our offerings to other jail populations at Rikers.
Recruit, train and support new volunteers.


Our perks and benefits are listed on the right side; the t-shirts feature the logo of the dharma center designed by renowned female graffiti artist Queen Andrea (pictured at the bottom of this page). The limited edition photograph choices are from a recent trip to our parent monastery in Sikkim, India, taken by Lucian Read. You can see those photographs here:



How our work makes a difference:

The impact of our work at Rikers has been felt by many, from inmates to correction officers and to the commissioner of the Department of Correction.  Here are a few testimonies:

""The
 Rangjung Prison Dharma Project has a working-relationship with the 
Department since April, 2014. The Rangjung Prison Dharma Project 
provides meditation classes and emotional
 support to the incarcerated population and uniform staff and is the 
only one of this kind on Rikers Island. The team helps the incarcerated 
population explore and gain insight about the effects of negative 
thoughts and feelings and their response to them,
 some of which might have contributed to their incarceration. In 
addition to services provided to the incarcerated population, the team 
work with Correction Officers to manage stress, anxiety and exhaustion.  
 We look forward to continuing this highly productive
 relationship with the Rangjung Prison Dharma Project and encourage 
their efforts
on Rikers Island."" -Department of CorrectionTo date we have served over 2,000 inmates and over 200 correction officers, and we have been asked to increase our services to reach a larger swath of the 8,000 to 10,000 inmates who are detained at Rikers at any given point in time.""Coming to meditation is the only way that I can deal with the anxiety that I feel as I wait for sentencing.""InmateIt is not uncommon for inmates to be detained at Rikers for as long as five years while waiting for sentencing.  During this long period of time inmates struggle with a wide range of difficult emotions, ranging from sadness to anxiety, depression, anger, rage, and loneliness.  We provide vital support to help inmates cope with being incarcerated and the effects that incarceration have on all of the spheres of their lives and relationships.
""Since I've been here, I've been separated from my family and my baby 
boy.  I am reminded every day about what I did that put me here and took
 me away from what I should be doing: taking care of my son. Meditation 
helps me see how I'm feeling and see some of the ways I made mistakes 
through my reactions.""

Inmate
Part of your donation will help us to develop a support program that will continue the benefit of the deep connections that we make with inmates while they are incarcerated. These benefits of being heard, supported, witnessed, and enriched through the contemplative support of meditation practice can continue as inmates make the adjustment to re-entry after release from incarceration.

""This is a very stressful place.  No one wants to be here.  But we are. 
 Meditation makes me feel peaceful.  I feel that even here, in jail, I 
can really feel who I am."" 

Inmate
Part of the stress of being incarcerated often includes feeling written-off by friends, family, and society at large.  A large part of what we do in addition to offering meditation is offering supportive conversation and dialogue as a way of exploring what makes those we serve feel whole, empowered and cared-for.

""Before I began meditating I felt closed to the world around me and my fellow officers.  Now I understand how the stress of this job and the constant exposure to violence had been affecting me both while on tour and at home.  Now I feel more in control of how I react to my surroundings.""
Correction Officer
There are an estimated 8,000 Correction Officers who work at Rikers performing tours between the 10 jail buildings on the island, transporting inmates to various court buildings for trial as well as to other locations.  Their jobs are stressful, unpredictable and often involve the threat of having to deal with violence on a daily basis, or being assaulted while on the job.  We currently provide meditation and emotional/contemplative support at one maximum security facility on the island.  Your donation will allow us to be able to provide needed support to the brave women and men who work under circumstances that most of us could not.

Other Ways You Can Help 
We recognize that some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help.  Help us by spreading the word about our campaign, use the share tools, use facebook, twitter, or regular email.  
We know that we can meet this funding goal. The work we do is important. Let's work together as a community to bring the benefits of meditation to everyone at Rikers!
Lastly, if you would like to volunteer with us, or know someone who might, contact us for more information at:  info@goshir.orgWe thank you for your wonderful support!",7.0,1,"1 Campaign

<div>Hey! Bethany here, I'm the writer, cinematographer, and co-producer for <i>The Girls of Summer</i>. I'm going into my final semester of film school at Arizona State University this fall and this  film is my last hurrah. My experience comes mainly from the gaffing and camera departments, having worked on some 30+ films in the last year and a half working as gaffer, key grip, cinematographer/director of photography, and assistant camera.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>This campaign is extremely important to me, not only because graduating depends upon it getting completed, but because it's about a subject that is near and dear to me: fastpitch softball. There are little to no films about softball, let alone fastpitch, and the few that there are make a mockery of the sport. So this short film is about breaking those walls down and showing that ""like a girl"" isn't as demeaning as it's become.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>By contributing to this project you're not only helping me and my collaborators but you are helping the sport of fastpitch softball. By working together we can achieve more than working alone and elevate the young women and girls that play this sport to a spotlight that seems to be diminished in the light of men's sports and poor stereotypes. Oh, and did I mention the perks?</div> <p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>Our budget is pretty massive for such a small film, but most of the costs come from the costuming department. For anyone who has ever had to order uniforms for a sport, you know it's not cheap. We are going for authentic, to make the film look as close to real as possible. So here's our breakdown:</p>

<b><h3>Who We Are:</h3></b>'Catch' made its West Coast premiere in San Diego, CA at the International Bullying Prevention Association's Annual Conference is 2014.<br/><br/>The short play was written with the intention of putting students, faculty, administration, and parents on an even playing field, encouraging honest conversation, emotions, connections, and debate. In order to better our school, home, and individual communities, we must forget what we think we know and listen to each person's words and stories. There is such a problem in our society both in school, online, and in the work place with bullying, harassment, negativity, and harmful physical/emotional behavior. This play asks the difficult questions that we sometimes skim over, demands answers, and digs deep into “finding how to fix what’s in people’s hearts.” Raw and honest, this was written for those who have not found their voice and are desperate for someone to hear their story.<br/><br/>Our goal is to turn our traveling show into a half hour film, where it will be incorporated into a full bullying prevention curriculum that will be sold to high schools both nationally and internationally. <br/><br/><h3></h3>
<h3>Call to Action:</h3>As most creative projects, ""Catch"" was created to make a fundamental change for our schools, and the team involved has worked tirelessly for over a year and a half for no pay. That's a year and a half of writing, editing, long meetings, long readings, long phone calls, networking, long hours in the car traveling, and late nights, all between everyone's busy schedules, day jobs, and personal life. Looking back, those efforts have been some of the most rewarding.  Because we believe that the impact of this message is so crucial to our current &amp; future students, school faculty &amp; administration, and parents, we have come to the point where funding is necessary to pay other professionals to help us properly create the film.  It isn't just necessary. It's mandatory.  In order to get it to students &amp; schools across the country, we have to do the best job we possibly can, and cannot sacrifice telling the story or building the prevention curriculum. This is for a group that needs a voice. And that voice has no limits. It is too big for a price tag. <br/><br/>The team is compromised of professionals within the film &amp; theatre industry, the fields of social work &amp; psychology, and bullying prevention activists.  This team not only wants to provide the media aspect of this project, but we want to offer live performances with in depth talk backs to schools that request us.  The funds we raise are far past appreciated--this campaign has the potential to make ""Catch"" a strong, new face of bullying prevention. <br/><br/>It takes a village to raise a child, right? We believe in it. We stand by it. You may never meet all the students 
impacted, but you will see the ripple effect throughout your community. 
We are that movement for the future. And we need your help. <br/><br/>

<p>[Words from the Playwright]:<br/></p>
<p>""The challenge in this piece, as a writer, was to develop a script that speaks for the students and does not preach to them. There is plenty of research and prevention methods which are fantastic, but the worst thing we can do is shove it down the throats of students who are already desensitized to the conversation. I wanted to create a piece that changes what we think we already know, as well as the direction we are going to better our schools, students, faculty, and social media realms. There will be moments in this play that may be shocking, frustrating, and outrageous. I hope that through (student) Carter and (principal) Tuckman's raw conversation, we as an audience can entertain new thoughts without necessarily accepting them as truth. Who is the bully? Who is the victim? What meaning do these labels bring? As a society, we are demanded by our youth to look at the individual stores and circumstances, listen to their words, and empower them as further adults. As students, we empower the adults and fellow students around us./ We must listen to each others' words. We must examine each story to find the truth at the root of it all. And we will. If we choose to look.""      <br/></p>
<p>Inspired by Holden from J.D. Salinger's 'The Catcher in the Rye"" and real students, this play/film does not hesitate to talk about those things that are the hardest, yet the most necessary. <br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>Plot:</h3>
<p>[A student. A principal. A gun. 40 minutes of honest conversation.]</p>
<p>It’s the evening before Christmas break, and Principle Tuckman is sitting in his office finishing his last bit of work. He is surrounded by moving boxes, and he is exhausted. A female student enters his office, demanding to talk. Tuckman tries to get her to make an appointment, but she is refusing to leave, explaining she has something very important to discuss with him. After polite arguing for a few moments, the student pulls a gun out of her backpack and holds it in her hands. The ball is in Tuckman’s court. Or is it?</p>
<p>Through the next hour, we learn about a boy named Allie Field who is severely bullied and the reason for Carter’s visit. Through sharp banter and honest conversation, the two harshly debate bullying, harassment, school policies, teachers, students, and ask the tough questions that have no definite answers. Within the conversation of Allie, we learn what is at the root of Carter’s visit, and Principal Tuckman is faced with a very difficult decision.</p>
<p>This is one conversation you can’t run from, and isn’t watered down. It is meant to spark debate, push conversation between student and teacher, and paints a not-so-pretty picture of the real struggles of life as a student. It’s gritty, heartfelt, and begs the question of how to “fix what’s in people’s hearts”.<br/><br/></p>

victims who knew their offenders, 68% (26 victims) were murdered by a husband,

Over the years many people have attempted to make low budget films in the attempts of recreating that 80's feel. I am about to make that happen. based off my ""slasher"" persona, my team and I are looking to produce a film that not only enhances what a horror film is, but also celebrate its historic impact in motion cinema.

</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>What are we asking for and what do we need? our goal for this film is $5,000. Why that much? Believe it or not, the majority of this will go to securing permits and equipment. Our entire staff are volunteering their time to participate and perform in this film. We are basically fans making a movie for the fans. Our perks allow you to not only get your name in our product, but also may get you a role! Ever wanted to die in a bloody gruesome way? It could happen here! We have experiences directors and cameramen ready to bring the world of horror to life. Any contributions would be greatly appreciated. Aside from permits and equipment, funds will also go for basic crew supplies such as small snacks and bottled waters. Help us in bring the 'slasher"" persona to film!<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>Movies today rely on huge budgets to give us ""eye candy"". Some of motion picture cinema's biggest and most successful films haven't used one ounce of CGI. Our film is a throwback to the days when molds and kits were used instead of cgi. Its been argued that practical effects are even better and look more realistic than there cgi counterparts. Aside from having 2 professional sfx artists on board, we will be using the best equipment we can get. Once our film comes to live, we hope it expands beyond youtube. We want the world to see not only can a good horror movie be made for next to nothing, but that the genre itself still offers something new.<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>The obvious risk is coming off as another low budget schlop of a film. That is far from my intention. I value my time where if i put my own time and money into something i want it to be the best. Every dollar we raise will help us. As someone who loves horror, i've seen my share of horrible movies,,what went wrong and why they didnt work. I want to not only make a movie that looks good but is done professionally and in the best way possible.<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>Stay tuned for updates regarding our facebook page! Even if you can't donate you can help spread the word around. Any publicity is good publicity :)<br/>

</div><b>“The New Business Brigade” and Ubaldi Reports Story </b><br/><br/>At no
 other time since WWII, have so many talented men and women been 
returning from foreign wars and reintegrating into the workforce. Will 
today's business owners and CEO's recognize and seize this valuable 
American asset?<br/><br/><b>Will America recognize the value of a Veteran?</b><br/><br/>After
 serving in the Marine Corps, with three combat tours in both Iraq and 
Afghanistan, I had the distinct pleasure of serving with the best men 
and women America has to offer.  These individuals are the “Next 
Greatest Generation”, but unlike their World War II forebears, they 
served in a different cause then the nation has ever faced before in its
 history. <br/><br/>One unfortunate aspect is that America knows very 
little of their experience, and few of the American people, especially 
our political leaders, literally have no connection to those who wear 
the nations uniform.<br/><br/>Far too often veterans are alienated from the very country they have sworn to protect and serve?  Why is that!<br/><br/>This
 is why I wrote “""The New Business Brigade: Veterans Dynamic Impact on 
US Business"". I wanted businesses across America to know of the untapped
 resource veterans represent. I also wanted to let the leaders in 
Washington know of the valuable resource at their disposal, making them 
understand what veterans have brought to this country, and continue to 
bring to this country. <br/> <br/>I did not want to just stop there, I 
wanted to challenge our political leaders in solving the nation’s most 
pressing concerns, but without a partisan spin. I want the fact’s, not 
fiction in news reporting.  This why I started my own company called 
“Ubaldi Reports”. The vision for the company is to be the only news 
organization which provides credible, documented, political content,

 other time since WWII, have so many talented men and women been 
returning from foreign wars and reintegrating into the workforce. Will 
today's business owners and CEO's recognize and seize this valuable 
American asset?Will America recognize the value of a Veteran?After
 serving in the Marine Corps, with three combat tours in both Iraq and 
Afghanistan, I had the distinct pleasure of serving with the best men 
and women America has to offer.  These individuals are the “Next 
Greatest Generation”, but unlike their World War II forebears, they 
served in a different cause then the nation has ever faced before in its
 history. One unfortunate aspect is that America knows very 
little of their experience, and few of the American people, especially 
our political leaders, literally have no connection to those who wear 
the nations uniform.Far too often veterans are alienated from the very country they have sworn to protect and serve?  Why is that!This
 is why I wrote “""The New Business Brigade: Veterans Dynamic Impact on 
US Business"". I wanted businesses across America to know of the untapped
 resource veterans represent. I also wanted to let the leaders in 
Washington know of the valuable resource at their disposal, making them 
understand what veterans have brought to this country, and continue to 
bring to this country.  I did not want to just stop there, I 
wanted to challenge our political leaders in solving the nation’s most 
pressing concerns, but without a partisan spin. I want the fact’s, not 
fiction in news reporting.  This why I started my own company called 
“Ubaldi Reports”. The vision for the company is to be the only news 
organization which provides credible, documented, political content, 
addressing domestic and global issues, written by U.S. military veterans
 and their dependents, on domestic and global issues.I wrote

criticizes the media for its coverage of third-party political 
candidates. The film follows Luis J. Rodriguez, the best-selling author 
of ""Always Running: La Vida Loca: Gang Days in LA"", a memoir of his life
 as a Los Angeles gang member. It documents four months of his campaign 
trail in the 2014 primary election for Governor of California as a Green
 Party candidate. The documentary continues after the election, with 
interviews from experts such as Noam Chomsky, Amy Goodman and Ralph 
Nader. The story follows the filmmaker on a journey discovering American
 democracy.</p>
<p>The film is almost complete.  However, we need finishing funds to get this film to the public.  Our goal is to achieve theatrical release before airing on broadcast TV 
in time for the 2016 elections, followed by online and DVD release.  </p>

<div>I'm Jungle Jane and I want to bring the wild to you! After years of volunteering on wildlife conservation projects and studying animal behavior, I began my career as a wildlife educator in Southern California. Traveling with animals to schools and events to educate, entertain and enlighten children and adults has been profoundly rewarding, but I'm ready to reach a bigger audience! Through exciting web videos I'm going to take viewers on wild adventures to meet amazing animals from around the world! I want to make education entertaining, conservation cool, and science sensational! While we have an awesome first video already in the works, and a small but growing crew of amazing individuals, we still need better equipment, a bigger crew, and food and shelter for the humans and other animals that are working so hard to make 'Wild World' happen. So help us make it happen! </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<p>If we reach our modest goal of $20,000 we will be able to purchase the necessary camera, lighting and sound equipment, and compensate our crew so we can keep making magic! Even better, if we reach our goal, 5% of all contributions will go directly to wildlife conservation. If you contribute, not only will you be funding a project dedicated to educating the world about our amazing wildlife, but you will be donating to wildlife in need! </p>
<p><br/></p>

<p><br/></p>
<p>All contributors will be able to say that they are part of a project that makes education fun, science accessible, and conservation a common practice. Educational programming is waning, and children and adults NEED a show that amazes them and ignites curiosity about science and our natural world. Jungle Jane's 'Wild World' is the answer! Influenced by the likes of  Bill Nye, Jeff Corwin, Jane Goodall, and Neil deGrasse Tyson, I'm ready to follow in their massive footsteps and encourage the next great generation of scientists. Let's do this together!</p>

<h2> Short Summary</h2>
<b><i>100 Litres</i> isn’t just a movie, it’s a movement.</b> This PBS documentary is a story about how we all depend on water and how people can unite to protect this human right -- worldwide -- and ensure reliable, affordable drinking water.  Ireland is a recent example of companies trying to privatize water, but instead of lying down, citizens are standing up in a national social change movement. <br/><br/><h4><b>Help us bring global awareness to this issue and show others how to protect their human rights to create a better world.</b></h4>
<br/><h2>
<i>100 Litres</i>: Why the name?</h2>The United Nations General Assembly of the Human Right to Water and Sanitation has recognized that every human being should have access to 50 - 100 litres of clean water, every day, for personal and domestic uses. When Ireland's government decided to ignore that families have already paid for their water through taxation and charged them twice for any water used, they unwittingly ignited a water revolution that has ricocheted around the country. <em><br/><br/></em><h4><em><b>This boils down to Irish citizens are being charged 10X more for water than the average American.</b></em></h4>
<br/><h2>Why you should care</h2>
<p><b>This could happen to you</b>. Water is being privatized all over the globe. If people stand by and let this happen, then this financial grab for precious resources will become commonplace. <br/></p>The people of Ireland are standing up for their Right2Water and are establishing a lasting model for others to learn from. The major catch here? Due to government and corporate corruption, there aren’t any Irish media outlets that are brave enough to cover this social change movement and Irish citizens have been relying on social media to spread the good word. <b>The <i>100 Litres</i> crew believes that these citizens deserve a global voice.</b><br/><br/><h2>The Synopsis </h2>
<i>100 Litres</i> is a full-length PBS documentary about water privatization in Ireland and the human rights movement being led by Irish citizens. While Irish citizens have paid for their water through taxes, the Irish government have added new fees to their water usage. <b>This is the equivalent of you buying a sandwich and the store clerk following you home to ask for ten times more than what you already paid. </b><br/><br/>Community organizations, political parties, and trade unions have joined together in a National human rights movement that's hundreds of thousands strong. Using peaceful protests and a human rights manifesto, Right2Water Ireland is taking on a corrupt government, corporations that are taking advantage of loopholes, and EU banks in a fight for the human right to water. This is a national revolution and no one is talking about it. <br/><br/><i>100 Litres </i>is a story of successful social change. We want to provide everyone with living examples of how activism can overcome bad government policies. This documentary will also expand outside of Ireland’s borders, shining light on the solidarity movement happening in Greece, the empowering work that’s being done by the Community Environmental Legal Defense Fund (CELDF) in the U.S., and a trip to meet with the Detroit Water Brigade. <br/><br/><h4>All of these stories are about people fighting for their human rights and we want to share them with you. Will you join the movement?</h4>

</h2>We have our crew, we have our contacts, we did our research. All we need is the financing for the travel and production costs.<br/><ul>
<li>The budget for <i>100 Litres</i> is actually $30,000</li>
<li>The $15,000 raised on here will help us get things started as far as production, travel, and gear. This may not cover the whole budget, but it can at least get the ball rolling and get our crew to Ireland to start filming before it's too late and we need to scrap the project.</li>
<li>We have all sorts of perks for donating available. Our goal with this Indiegogo isn't only to raise funds, we also want to connect the audience with these change-makers. Take a look at our Perks to find out how you can feel like part of the project (and learn a little Gaelic in the process). <br/>
</li>
</ul>
<b>Donation Options:</b><br/><i>100 Litres</i> has been backed by PBS. This means we have nonprofit status and the option for tax deductible donations is available. For those who are interested in using this avenue to contribute to the film, please contact the crew directly at <b>info@100litresfilm.com</b> and we will follow-up with instructions for donating through PBS.<br/><br/><h2>Other Ways You Can Help <br/>

<blockquote>100 Litres isn't just a movie. It's a movement.<br/>
</blockquote>We all depend on water, and in a warming world, billions may lose reliable access to this precious resource. This is the story of global water warriors united in a worldwide campaign to protect human access to reliable, affordable drinking water. From politically-motivated water charges in Ireland, to fracking in Ohio, from solidarity rallies in Greece, to water shutoffs in bankrupt Detroit, <i>100 Litres</i> is a story of social change and how street activism works outside of the realm of traditional politics. <br/><br/>At the moment, the Right2Water Ireland human rights campaign is a grassroots movement, but we want this film to make it more than that – we want to bring Right2Water Ireland’s stories, struggles, and proactive strategies to the world. People all over the planet are being oppressed by greed, corporate interest, and scarcity of resources. We believe that the actions of Right2Water Ireland, combined with the solidarity movement happening in Greece, and the work of the Detroit Water Brigade all offer positive models of social change that a mass audience can relate to and use. <br/><br/>We believe this documentary could be the critical mass that many people who are living with oppression need. Are you looking to start a revolution? Are you sick of ""the greedy few"" slowly destroying our only home and all the resources it needs to sustain life? Our planet and it's resources are not just commodities to be bought and sold. The working class should no longer have to carry the burden of the irresponsible decisions made by those who have the best financial portfolios. It's time to stand. It's time to shout. <i>100 Litres</i> will provide the stories, experiences, and failures of others to help every global citizen learn from their actions and find the solutions they need change our world for the better.<br/><br/><h2>Risks &amp; Challenges </h2>Our biggest challenge is making sure that the masses are aware of what’s happening and unite together to support the making of this project. We need the funding in time for the human rights, Town Hall Tour that will kick off in mid-September. If we don't reach our production goal, we'll have to scrap the project. <br/><br/><h2>More in-depth information</h2>

</div></div>","Short Summary
100 Litres isn’t just a movie, it’s a movement. This PBS documentary is a story about how we all depend on water and how people can unite to protect this human right -- worldwide -- and ensure reliable, affordable drinking water.  Ireland is a recent example of companies trying to privatize water, but instead of lying down, citizens are standing up in a national social change movement. Help us bring global awareness to this issue and show others how to protect their human rights to create a better world.

100 Litres: Why the name?The United Nations General Assembly of the Human Right to Water and Sanitation has recognized that every human being should have access to 50 - 100 litres of clean water, every day, for personal and domestic uses. When Ireland's government decided to ignore that families have already paid for their water through taxation and charged them twice for any water used, they unwittingly ignited a water revolution that has ricocheted around the country. This boils down to Irish citizens are being charged 10X more for water than the average American.
Why you should care
This could happen to you. Water is being privatized all over the globe. If people stand by and let this happen, then this financial grab for precious resources will become commonplace. The people of Ireland are standing up for their Right2Water and are establishing a lasting model for others to learn from. The major catch here? Due to government and corporate corruption, there aren’t any Irish media outlets that are brave enough to cover this social change movement and Irish citizens have been relying on social media to spread the good word. The 100 Litres crew believes that these citizens deserve a global voice.The Synopsis 
100 Litres is a full-length PBS documentary about water privatization in Ireland and the human rights movement being led by Irish citizens. While Irish citizens have paid for their water through taxes, the Irish government have added new fees to their water usage. This is the equivalent of you buying a sandwich and the store clerk following you home to ask for ten times more than what you already paid. Community organizations, political parties, and trade unions have joined together in a National human rights movement that's hundreds of thousands strong. Using peaceful protests and a human rights manifesto, Right2Water Ireland is taking on a corrupt government, corporations that are taking advantage of loopholes, and EU banks in a fight for the human right to water. This is a national revolution and no one is talking about it. 100 Litres is a story of successful social change. We want to provide everyone with living examples of how activism can overcome bad government policies. This documentary will also expand outside of Ireland’s borders, shining light on the solidarity movement happening in Greece, the empowering work that’s being done by the Community Environmental Legal Defense Fund (CELDF) in the U.S., and a trip to meet with the Detroit Water Brigade. All of these stories are about people fighting for their human rights and we want to share them with you. Will you join the movement?
(photo via: Right2Water Ireland)What We Need & What You Get 
We have our crew, we have our contacts, we did our research. All we need is the financing for the travel and production costs.
The budget for 100 Litres is actually $30,000
The $15,000 raised on here will help us get things started as far as production, travel, and gear. This may not cover the whole budget, but it can at least get the ball rolling and get our crew to Ireland to start filming before it's too late and we need to scrap the project.
We have all sorts of perks for donating available. Our goal with this Indiegogo isn't only to raise funds, we also want to connect the audience with these change-makers. Take a look at our Perks to find out how you can feel like part of the project (and learn a little Gaelic in the process). 


Donation Options:100 Litres has been backed by PBS. This means we have nonprofit status and the option for tax deductible donations is available. For those who are interested in using this avenue to contribute to the film, please contact the crew directly at info@100litresfilm.com and we will follow-up with instructions for donating through PBS.Other Ways You Can Help 
While we do need to raise funds for paying the crew and for food, there are other ways to contribute. If you can't donate, the second best thing you can do to support this project is share our Indiegogo. We are also looking for in-kind donations.

<p></p>
<p><b>Let’s get to know each
other!  :) </b></p>
<p></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">My name is Thirati, but you can
call me Tee! I am a U.S.-based
special effects makeup artist and have been
working in the entertainment industry for the past 4 years. I started my career in Thailand as a commercial
actor at the age of 14 and am thankful to be able to say that I’ve had a
successful career in the entertainment industry for more than a decade. I
attended SrinakarinvirotePrasanmit (SWU) in
Bangkok, Thailand and majored in Fine Art of Directing and Acting. This
is where I first learned that I had an interest in Directing.</p>
<p></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">My
love of cinema, specifically the horror genre, lead me to the Cinema Makeup School in Los Angeles where I learned the craft of
makeup and special effects.
After graduation, I interned with Emmy Award winner Dean Jones, who started out
as a makeup artist (just like me) and went on to write, direct and produce his
own horror films. This was an inspiration for me to do the same, but I
also knew I needed to learn more. To do so, I joined the prestigious team at
the Makeup Effects Laboratory(MEL), working under the mentorship of Academy Award winning
makeup artist, Kevin Haney. While at MEL, I really honed my craft as a special effects
makeup artist, learning the tricks-of-the-trade, complete with how camera
angles effect the look of make-up on an actor. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">After
years of acting,
working in makeup and special effects, and learning about all the craft of
production, I am now ready to put it all together in my own film; similar to
many before me. This film will be submitted to film festivals across the U.S.
with the goal of
developing it into a feature
film in the future. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">However, to make all this reality, <b>I need your help.</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p></p>
</div>
<p><b><i>""I
love horror films, and my goal is to make a horror film that not only keeps you
on the edge and jumping out of your seat, but to also have a strong storyline
that enriches your own life."" </i></b></p>

short horror film, Written and Directed by Thirati K.






Let’s get to know each
other!  :) 

My name is Thirati, but you can
call me Tee! I am a U.S.-based
special effects makeup artist and have been
working in the entertainment industry for the past 4 years. I started my career in Thailand as a commercial
actor at the age of 14 and am thankful to be able to say that I’ve had a
successful career in the entertainment industry for more than a decade. I
attended SrinakarinvirotePrasanmit (SWU) in
Bangkok, Thailand and majored in Fine Art of Directing and Acting. This
is where I first learned that I had an interest in Directing.

My
love of cinema, specifically the horror genre, lead me to the Cinema Makeup School in Los Angeles where I learned the craft of
makeup and special effects.
After graduation, I interned with Emmy Award winner Dean Jones, who started out
as a makeup artist (just like me) and went on to write, direct and produce his
own horror films. This was an inspiration for me to do the same, but I
also knew I needed to learn more. To do so, I joined the prestigious team at
the Makeup Effects Laboratory(MEL), working under the mentorship of Academy Award winning
makeup artist, Kevin Haney. While at MEL, I really honed my craft as a special effects
makeup artist, learning the tricks-of-the-trade, complete with how camera
angles effect the look of make-up on an actor. 
After
years of acting,
working in makeup and special effects, and learning about all the craft of
production, I am now ready to put it all together in my own film; similar to
many before me. This film will be submitted to film festivals across the U.S.
with the goal of
developing it into a feature
film in the future. 
However, to make all this reality, I need your help.




""I
love horror films, and my goal is to make a horror film that not only keeps you
on the edge and jumping out of your seat, but to also have a strong storyline
that enriches your own life."" 










Imagine when it gets dark...!!

<p><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p>The music industry has
changed, in the modern internet age, playing live is no longer just a marketing
expense to promote a new album. Recordings are freely downloaded (legally or
otherwise) and more and more musicians are earning their wage playing gigs,
giving rise to the <i>never ending tour</i>
that has become the norm for many established artists.</p>
<p>Small intimate gigs –
the smaller the better –  have always
been a rare, sought after experience. In recent years a new phenomenon has
emerged: housegigs are popping up across the UK. No longer do you need to
travel to a large venue to see your favourite singer perform, you can get them
to come to you. </p>
<p>Can you imagine that?
Your favourite musician pulling up outside your house, walking up your path,
guitar slung over shoulder, setting up in the corner of your living room? </p>
<p></p>

<br/><p>How would that work?
Who attends house gigs? Who puts them on? Who plays them?</p>We want to find out what it is that makes house gigs so special and why they are becoming more and more popular.<br/><br/>We asked established
housegig performers Henry Priestman (over 40 housegigs in the past 18 months) and his guitarist and compadre, Loved Up Les, if we could follow them around the house gig circuit, meeting established promoters
as well as first timers and find out what is it that makes house gigs so good.<br/><br/><h3>Who's Involved?</h3>
<p><b>Henry Priestman</b></p>
<p>After over 35 years in the music
business – and with a credit list longer than both your arms – in 2009 Henry
Priestman reinvented himself as a singer-songwriter, and released his debut
solo CD <i>“The Chronicles of Modern Life”</i> to critical acclaim.
Followed by “<i>The last Mad Surge of Youth”</i>
in 2014 and the live DVD “<i>Settle Down</i>”
in 2015.</p>

Introduction
The music industry has
changed, in the modern internet age, playing live is no longer just a marketing
expense to promote a new album. Recordings are freely downloaded (legally or
otherwise) and more and more musicians are earning their wage playing gigs,
giving rise to the never ending tour
that has become the norm for many established artists.
Small intimate gigs –
the smaller the better –  have always
been a rare, sought after experience. In recent years a new phenomenon has
emerged: housegigs are popping up across the UK. No longer do you need to
travel to a large venue to see your favourite singer perform, you can get them
to come to you. 
Can you imagine that?
Your favourite musician pulling up outside your house, walking up your path,
guitar slung over shoulder, setting up in the corner of your living room? 


How would that work?
Who attends house gigs? Who puts them on? Who plays them?We want to find out what it is that makes house gigs so special and why they are becoming more and more popular.We asked established
housegig performers Henry Priestman (over 40 housegigs in the past 18 months) and his guitarist and compadre, Loved Up Les, if we could follow them around the house gig circuit, meeting established promoters
as well as first timers and find out what is it that makes house gigs so good.Who's Involved?
Henry Priestman
After over 35 years in the music
business – and with a credit list longer than both your arms – in 2009 Henry
Priestman reinvented himself as a singer-songwriter, and released his debut
solo CD “The Chronicles of Modern Life” to critical acclaim.
Followed by “The last Mad Surge of Youth”
in 2014 and the live DVD “Settle Down”
in 2015.



He’s sold millions of records, performed
in stadiums around the world to tens of thousands of people and was a regular
fixture on Top of the Pops in the 80s and 90s with his band The Christians. His
first band, Yachts, supported The Who on a European tour and toured America
with Elvis Costello. The Christians played Wembley
Arena, and even performed to 100,000 people in Paris.
But Henry says “My smallest solo gig was playing in someone’s kitchen in Ibrox,
Glasgow, in front of about 25 people… I’m now enjoying myself more than ever.”
Loved Up Les
Over the last 35 years, Les has been performing, either as a solo artist or as part of a band, both in the UK and across Europe, and has several TV and radio appearances to his credit.

He has a healthy love of all styles of music, from Hank Williams to Motorhead and an unhealthy love of 70’s Pop. Les can often be heard incorporating an interesting cover or two into his live performances.
Les has been playing alongside Henry for 2 years and the pair have developed an on stage presence that has been described as 'Vic & Bob with guitars'.
The Film Makers
Helen
Helen  co-produced Henry's live dvd - Settle Down - along with Paul, who filmed and edited the show. Having worked with Henry on a variety of projects - from website design to music videos for Valentine Song  and Goodbye Common Sense, she suggested working on a full length live release. Throughout the process, they heard Henry talking about house gigs and met several fans at merch' stalls, talking about house gigs they'd attended, or were promoting themselves. It made them wonder how this phenomenon got started and what makes someone open up their living room and turn it into an intimate concert venue. 



Helen runs a digital media social enterprise and has lots of experience coordinating budgets and community projects. She's also an author so she's always looking for the story in everything she does. She's worked with Henry for 5 years, as his web designer, designing his artwork, posters and adverts and t-shirts. She said ""it's been an honour and privilege to work with Henry over the last couple of years. He has enjoyed an enviable career in music spanning 35 years and we are excited at being able to tell some of Henry's story alongside exploring this emerging trend for house gigs.""
Paul 
Paul is a freelance video editor, who, after working in a boring office job for 15 years embraced redundancy and pursued his dreams of making films. He's been involved with the filming and editing of many short documentaries focusing on local community businesses and social enterprises. He's also the editor of a weekly business news video blog for YB News. 


After filming and editing music videos for Henry - Valentine Song and Goodbye Common Sense, as well as Men of a Certain Age for Les, he's gotten to know their best sides! 
He has always wanted to make a feature length documentary and feels we have found a subject that will interest and inspire people.

<div>""Homestruck"" is a new comedy web series about life and all of it's comically unfortunate side effects. </div>
<div>Logline: Broke and unemployed, Sean Edelman is forced to move across the country to live with the three worst roommates imaginable...his family.</div> <p>Plot Synopsis: Ever since he was a kid, Sean Edelman wanted to be on Broadway. Raised in Los Angeles, the film industry never really interested him so he moved out to New York. Three years later, at age 27, he is forced to move back west and once again live with his dysfunctional family which includes a hard-ass father, a mother who always tries just a little too much, and a brother who cares more about video games than the world around him. Now, Sean doesn't really know what to do with his life except to take it as it comes. It doesn't help matters that his ex-girlfriend still lives next door.</p>
<p>While the series is comedic, we think there are a lot of themes that are going to hit home for a lot of viewers.<br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>Dollars &amp; Cents</h3> <p>To make the first season of ""Homestruck"" a reality we need some financial assistance. The days of shooting films in our friends' backyards is over. To make this show look as good as it can we need to pay for some necessities.</p>
<p>Cast &amp; Crew: ~$5200. Somewhere along the way these people got it in their heads that they deserved to be compensated for their hard work. Pfffft. Ok, I guess that makes sense.</p>
<p>Food: ~$500. Wait, they want us to pay them AND feed them while on set? Food for a big group for seven days costs a lot. Plus, since we're in L.A, everyone is probably going to want a vegan, organic, gluten-free, fat-free, low-calorie, diet almond milk protein shake.</p>
<p>Locations: ~$700. We need to pay for locations to be able to use them.</p>
<p>Equipment: ~$500. While we have access to most of what we will need, there are a few necessary additions to make production go smoothly.</p>
<p>Props/etc: ~$300. We gotta make everything look good so we are going to need little knick knacks to ""dress the set""</p>
<p>Fees: ~$300. It costs money to register scripts, submit to festivals, get royalties and various other boring paperwork doodads.</p>

<p>Sevgili arkadaşlar,</p>
<p>Ödüllü belgeselimiz Ekümenopolis’in ardından yeni bir uzun metraj belgesel için kolları sıvadık. Bu sefer çıtayı biraz daha yükseltip küresel finans sektörü ve ona hükmeden sermayenin kentlerimizi nasıl şekillendirdiği üzerine uluslararası çapta bir belgesel yapmak amacımız. Resme daha küresel ölçekte bakan, hikayeyi sermayenin merkezinden, New York'dan alıp, finansal yatırım ve emlak araçlarının oluşturduğu çarklardan geçerek kentlerimizi, yaşam alanlarımızı şekillendiren bu devasa mekanizmaya içeriden bir bakışı ekrana taşımayı hedefliyoruz. </p>
<p>Bize göre oldukça yüksek bir yapım bütçesine sahip olan bu projenin finansmanı için (özellikle sinema kalitesinde ekipman ihtiyacı ve dünyanın belli başlı kentlerinde çekimler yüzünden) yurtiçi ve yurtdışından birçok fona ve ortağa ihtiyacımız olacak. Ancak kar amacı ile tasarlanan birçok yabancı yapımla yarışmamız için projemizi geliştirip sağlam bir fragman hazırlamamız gerekiyor. Bu da New York'da yapılacak bir araştırma ve çekim süreci demek. Filmimize ihtiyacı olan fonu bulabilmemiz büyük ölçüde bu fragmana bağlı. Bu fragmanın başarısı filmin yapımında desteğinizin misliyle geri dönüşü demek olacak. </p>
<p>Desteğiniz ve dayanışmanız için teşekkürler!</p>

<p>After the award-winning “Ecumenopolis: City Without Limits” we have now embarked on another feature-length documentary. This time we are aiming a bit higher, trying to make a truly international film about how the global finance sector and the capital that governs it shape our cities. Looking at the big picture on a global scale, we will start our story from the heart of capital and finance, in New York City. Going through the gears of financial investments, speculation, and real estate instruments, we hope to reveal the inner workings of this elaborate mechanism that dominate our cities and living spaces.</p>
<p>The relatively high production budget of this documentary (due to the cinema-quality equipment needs and shootings in major cities around the world) requires us to find funding and production partners, both domestic and foreign. However, in order to compete with profit-oriented big-budget films for funding, we need to fully develop our project and produce a very strong trailer. And this means researching and shooting in New York, which is quite expensive by itself. Finding the funding for the documentary depends for the most part on this trailer. The success of this trailer means that your contribution to the documentary will be multiplied many fold.</p>
<p>Thank you for your support and solidarity!</p>

and his early diagnoses of </span>Alopecia<span style=""font-weight: normal;"">, being </span>bullied<span style=""font-weight: normal;""> or his many high profile
appearances. It’s a story about a shy boy who through the love of Jazz music
overcame these challenges. He went on to further explore Jazz music only to
realize that there was no Jazz music being aired on the radio stations, T.V. Networks
or Award shows. 95% of people when they think of Jazz music they tend to think
small as it relates to the listening audience. It is this very mindset that is
hurting Jazz musicians all over the world and they find it hard to see
themselves with the type of success that many of the rock, pop or rap artist
have. As a result Ski Johnson came up with ingenious ways to “brand and market”
Jazz music and himself to the mainstream media and audiences everywhere. This was
very unusual and unheard of for a Jazz musician to do and would ultimately lead
to major controversy with him.</span>

<p>We are almost finished with production and will headed into post production. We have a few more interviews to finish and we are now about to cross the bridge into licensing of archival footage/materials and music (all very pricey).  We also need  to build our post production team who will help us shape this phenomenal story. We've used up a lot of our favors, relationships and thankfully we have some generous <i>and </i> talented friends and colleagues who were able to help us get to this point. <b>The $65,000 we are trying to raise will barely scratch the surface of our overall costs, so we hope to be able to raise above and beyond this amount.  </b></p>
<p>We have self-financed everything up until now and have been working on this film in between other projects, but we know with the appropriate support from the Indiegogo and indie film community, not only will we be able to finish it faster, we will be able to make the film the best it can be. <b>We want to do a honest and candid film. </b>To do it right, and to get it done by mid 2016, we need your help. </p>

</div></div>","Jazz For Life is a feature length-Documentary about Ski Johnson, a jazz saxophonist who discovered the Power of Marketing and how to Maneuver through the Good, the Bad and the Hidden Dangers to create success. For over 25 years Ski Johnson has released over 10 recordings, of which two albums hit #1 on the Billboard Charts and were considered for Grammy Awards in several categories on the Ballot. Ski Johnson has tried to come up with innovative ways to promote Jazz through his music, music videos and appearances from The Emmy Awards to The Grammy Awards.    There are many familiar faces to help tell this incredible story.












Jazz For Life Documentary is more than a story about Ski Johnson
and his early diagnoses of Alopecia, being bullied or his many high profile
appearances. It’s a story about a shy boy who through the love of Jazz music
overcame these challenges. He went on to further explore Jazz music only to
realize that there was no Jazz music being aired on the radio stations, T.V. Networks
or Award shows. 95% of people when they think of Jazz music they tend to think
small as it relates to the listening audience. It is this very mindset that is
hurting Jazz musicians all over the world and they find it hard to see
themselves with the type of success that many of the rock, pop or rap artist
have. As a result Ski Johnson came up with ingenious ways to “brand and market”
Jazz music and himself to the mainstream media and audiences everywhere. This was
very unusual and unheard of for a Jazz musician to do and would ultimately lead
to major controversy with him.

















                                               




            






We are almost finished with production and will headed into post production. We have a few more interviews to finish and we are now about to cross the bridge into licensing of archival footage/materials and music (all very pricey).  We also need  to build our post production team who will help us shape this phenomenal story. We've used up a lot of our favors, relationships and thankfully we have some generous and  talented friends and colleagues who were able to help us get to this point. The $65,000 we are trying to raise will barely scratch the surface of our overall costs, so we hope to be able to raise above and beyond this amount.  
We have self-financed everything up until now and have been working on this film in between other projects, but we know with the appropriate support from the Indiegogo and indie film community, not only will we be able to finish it faster, we will be able to make the film the best it can be. We want to do a honest and candid film. To do it right, and to get it done by mid 2016, we need your help. 
Know that any amount given will go towards finishing the film and will help get this remarkable story out there. We have some pretty nice perks available (see them to the right). We have come up with some interesting perks from our Partners, as a way of saying thank you. We even have perks for those who really want to get involved called the EXECUTIVE ON THE FILM ,GET REALLY INVOLVED AND CO-PRODUCER . These are ones that could really help us alot.

We expect to release the Jazz for Life Documentary around mid 2016.

However, till 2013 this festive spirit didn’t reach Sonagachi.</b>  <b>The sex workers are socially barred from participating in the festival.</b> Despite the fact that without the earth from a sex worker’s house, the idol of the goddess created for veneration during Durga Puja is considered incomplete, the very sex workers are ostracized from the festival because of their profession.</p><p><b>This is the story of how the sex workers of Sonagachi, claimed their right to worship <i>Goddess Durga</i> and their continuing struggles against a hypocritical society which questions their rights, by the virtue of the presumed morals of their profession. <br/></b></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1441871224/tpq3qpgketn6fnqgr8sb.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h3>(Her)History...<br/>
</h3><p><b>Way back in 2013, these sex workers with the help of their collective <i><em><i>Durbar Mahila</i> <i>Samanwaya</i></em> Committee</i> went all the way to High Court to get the permission to have their own Durga Puja.</b> They were allowed to hold the puja inside Durbar’s clinic “<i>Avinash</i>”. <br/></p><p>The following year, the sex workers found themselves at the High Court again as their appeal to hold the puja in an outdoors Pandal was opposed. The space chosen for the pandal was contested by police as being an impediment for smooth flow of transport and emergency services. Various other communities have previously used the very same space to set up pandals for other festivals like Ganesh Puja and Kali Puja. However, the sex workers were compelled to hold their Durga Puja inside the clinic again.</p><p>However, this is just the story of Sonagachi, other red light areas of Kolkata like Kalighat,  Mushigunj Road etc have not yet received the permission to hold their Durga Puja. Many sex workers travel to Sonagachi during the Puja to worship Goddess Durga.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442425597/ee0kzqh3ybpos3tpw3gx.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3><strong>What is Durga Puja?</strong></h3><p><b>Durga Puja is perhaps the most important festival for Bengalis all over the world. The festival is celebrated with a lot of passion in Kolkata. </b>It marks the time when Goddess Durga fought and defeated the demon Mahisasura. It is a festival that celebrates triumph of good over evil.</p><p><b>However, it is not just the meaning of the festival that makes it important, it is how it is celebrated. </b>Usually, for large scale Pujas, many communities come together to celebrate Durga Puja. Here various families gather together to worship the goddess and participate in the rituals. Smaller pujas are considered a family affair where generations of a family and the extended family attend the Puja and participate in the rituals. <b>It is a very social festival.</b></p><p><b>In addition, an added attraction of Durga Puja is the Pandal, the outdoor temporary shed that are designed in the most artistic ways</b>. These pandals house the goddess’s idol and also provide an area for various cultural programs, dance and music shows to take place. Large groups of families and friends are often seen traversing through various pandals, marveling at the architecture, worshiping the idols, checking out the cultural programs and having a merry time.</p><p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1441871015/kkvxvyprrqj9dalzu50c.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 620px; height: 465px;""/></p>
<h3><strong>What is the story?</strong></h3><p>This year the sex workers are going to apply to have their puja in a pandal again. We are going to follow them through their journey. In addition, we will look into the importance of holding their own Durga Puja for these sex workers. <b>The rituals and the festive spirit that was so far denied to them is being claimed by them.</b> <b>This is an account of sex workers fighting for their rights.</b> At a deeper level it is a fight for human right; the right to worship your god/ goddess, as and how you wish. <br/></p><p> For us, we want to make more people aware of the issue. Many people do not know that sex workers are the only group that cannot participate in Durga Puja. <b>We hope that after this documentary, it becomes easier for the sex workers of Sonagachi and other red light areas of Kolkata to hold their Durga Puja as they want.</b></p>
<h3><b>Where will the money go?</b></h3><p>
We have been working on the film for almost a year now and up to now this project has been 100% self funded. While my savings account has gotten us this far, the time has come to add committed resources that will turbo-charge the post-production process and ensure that we finish our film.</p>

When the campaign is a success the film will be sent to film festivals in India and abroad, where people just like you will get to know about the strength of these women. Afterwards, it will be available for DVD, TV, online streaming, educational distribution etc.<br/>

However, till 2013 this festive spirit didn’t reach Sonagachi.  The sex workers are socially barred from participating in the festival. Despite the fact that without the earth from a sex worker’s house, the idol of the goddess created for veneration during Durga Puja is considered incomplete, the very sex workers are ostracized from the festival because of their profession.This is the story of how the sex workers of Sonagachi, claimed their right to worship Goddess Durga and their continuing struggles against a hypocritical society which questions their rights, by the virtue of the presumed morals of their profession. 
(Her)History...
Way back in 2013, these sex workers with the help of their collective Durbar Mahila Samanwaya Committee went all the way to High Court to get the permission to have their own Durga Puja. They were allowed to hold the puja inside Durbar’s clinic “Avinash”. The following year, the sex workers found themselves at the High Court again as their appeal to hold the puja in an outdoors Pandal was opposed. The space chosen for the pandal was contested by police as being an impediment for smooth flow of transport and emergency services. Various other communities have previously used the very same space to set up pandals for other festivals like Ganesh Puja and Kali Puja. However, the sex workers were compelled to hold their Durga Puja inside the clinic again.However, this is just the story of Sonagachi, other red light areas of Kolkata like Kalighat,  Mushigunj Road etc have not yet received the permission to hold their Durga Puja. Many sex workers travel to Sonagachi during the Puja to worship Goddess Durga.

What is Durga Puja?Durga Puja is perhaps the most important festival for Bengalis all over the world. The festival is celebrated with a lot of passion in Kolkata. It marks the time when Goddess Durga fought and defeated the demon Mahisasura. It is a festival that celebrates triumph of good over evil.However, it is not just the meaning of the festival that makes it important, it is how it is celebrated. Usually, for large scale Pujas, many communities come together to celebrate Durga Puja. Here various families gather together to worship the goddess and participate in the rituals. Smaller pujas are considered a family affair where generations of a family and the extended family attend the Puja and participate in the rituals. It is a very social festival.In addition, an added attraction of Durga Puja is the Pandal, the outdoor temporary shed that are designed in the most artistic ways. These pandals house the goddess’s idol and also provide an area for various cultural programs, dance and music shows to take place. Large groups of families and friends are often seen traversing through various pandals, marveling at the architecture, worshiping the idols, checking out the cultural programs and having a merry time.

What is the story?This year the sex workers are going to apply to have their puja in a pandal again. We are going to follow them through their journey. In addition, we will look into the importance of holding their own Durga Puja for these sex workers. The rituals and the festive spirit that was so far denied to them is being claimed by them. This is an account of sex workers fighting for their rights. At a deeper level it is a fight for human right; the right to worship your god/ goddess, as and how you wish.  For us, we want to make more people aware of the issue. Many people do not know that sex workers are the only group that cannot participate in Durga Puja. We hope that after this documentary, it becomes easier for the sex workers of Sonagachi and other red light areas of Kolkata to hold their Durga Puja as they want.
Where will the money go?
We have been working on the film for almost a year now and up to now this project has been 100% self funded. While my savings account has gotten us this far, the time has come to add committed resources that will turbo-charge the post-production process and ensure that we finish our film.
Our commitment to this project implies that we are going to finish it no matter how successful this campaign is, because we believe that this story must be told.

Our fundraising budget is designed to with the aim of avoiding the situation where the common man is oblivious to the film and the struggles of these women. For this reason we still need you to make sure that the film reaches everyone and makes a social impact.

When the campaign is a success the film will be sent to film festivals in India and abroad, where people just like you will get to know about the strength of these women. Afterwards, it will be available for DVD, TV, online streaming, educational distribution etc.

Crowdfunding</h3><p> Leider haben wir ein Problem, denn eines unserer Sponsorings hat nicht funktioniert. Aufgeben hat aber noch nie zu unseren Stärken gehört, sonst wären wir nicht dort wo wir sind. Daher haben wir uns entschlossen eine Crowdfunding Kampagne auf indiegogo zu starten. </p><h3>Unser Ziele</h3><div>Ein großes Etappenziel ist das erreichen von Südostasien (Thailand, Laos, Kambodscha, ...), dass ist das Hauptziel dieser Crowdfunding Kampagne . Wir haben gerade den Nordosten von  Kasachstan verlassen und sind wieder in Russland. Vor uns liegen mehr als achttausend Kilometer durch Russland, die kaum erschlossene Mongolei und das restriktive China. Wenn diese Kampagne das Kampagnenziel übersteigen sollte fließt dieses Geld in die Passage nach Südamerika, mit Zwischenziel Australien (die mit den Kängurus :) ). Die Durchfahrt durch China (seeeeehr teuer) haben wir im Vorfeld schon bezahlt. Klappt das Crowdfunding nicht, verlieren wir dieses Geld und das wäre sehr schade.</div><p></p><ul>
<li>
<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Wir werden am Ende unserer Reise diese als Buch und Film veröffentlichen. Kostenfrei, für alle. Auf Youtube, Facebook, Amazon und allen anderen Plattformen die wir in die Finger bekommen.  </span><br/>
</li>
<li>Unser zweites Ziel ist es unser Land zu repräsentieren. Das kleine, schöne Österreich. Wir, beide stolz auf unser Land, wollen Österreich als das freundliche Land vermitteln dass es auch ist. </li>
</ul><div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1439459297/zzoptaetly9vu2mph0fa.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
</div><h3>Warum geht ihr nicht einfach arbeiten?</h3><div>Das ist natürlich eine legitime Frage. Natürlich wollen wir unser Reisebudget mit Arbeitspausen, mitunter in Südoasasien, aufbessern. </div><div>Das Problem ist im momentan dass wir eine fest gebuchte Durchfahrt durch China haben, die ca ein Monat dauert und am 14. September startet. Davor müssen wir noch durch die ganze Mongolei, es fehlt uns dadurch die Zeit zu stoppen. Wir haben diese Durchfahrt vor längerer Zeit gebucht, nicht wissend dass uns das in eine Zwickmühle bringen wird. <br/>
</div><h3>Für unsere Sponsoren</h3><p></p><p>Wir wollen natürlich eine Gegenleistung erbringen für das Geld. Film- und Buchcredits gehören dazu, als auch Flächen für Werbung auf unserem Auto. </p><p>Das Auto ist mit 4000 Stickern (Stickerbombing) planiert. <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Dadurch zieht es  die Aufmerksamkeit auf sich, wird fotografiert und gefilmt. Der verblichene Kuhschädel den wir in Kasachstan auf die Motorhaube montiert haben ist die Kirsche auf der Torte.</span></p><p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> Unsere Sponsoren bekommen nun Plätze für ihre Werbung in den Seitenscheiben, der Heckscheibe und auf der Motorhaube des Autos. Individuell kann auch eine ganze Scheibe oder ein Teil davon vereinbart werden (bitte um Kontakt). </span></p><p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Die seitlichen Solarzellen Marke Eigenbau, die leider nie wie gut funktioniert haben und inzwischen durch Temperatur und Erschütterung kaputt sind, werden mit Filz in Signalfarben verkleidet, wie auf einem der Fotos ersichtlich. So kommt die Werbung zu Geltung. </span></p><p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Die Folie auf der Motorhaube wird entfernt, darunter ist das Auto Dunkelgrau Metallic. Farbenfrohe Werbung sticht auf diesem Untergrund heraus.</span></p><p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Deine Werbung oder eine Botschaft die du vermitteln willst, geht so um die Welt, ist Teil eines einzigartigen Fahrzeugs und einer unglaublichen Reise. </span></p><p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Gerne drucken wir eine Grafik oder Werbung auf unserem Canon Selphy Fotodrucker aus und kleben diese ins Auto. Wenn du uns einen Aufkleber lieber zusenden möchtest geben wir rechtzeitig vor Ablauf der Kampagne die Adresse einer Unterkunft, vermutlich in Russland, bekannt. Als Zustelldienst empfehlen wir DHL oder FED-EX.</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1439453941/wzqu4zxkamyo3a2ajzel.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Wir schrotten unser Auto, sei es durch Unfall oder einen mechanischen K.O.. Das wäre schlecht für Sponsoren mit Werbung auf dem Auto aber das gehört dazu und es kann passieren. Dreizehntausend Kilometer lang ist abgesehen von einer gerissenen Antriebswelle nicht viel passiert aber Garantie gibt es keine. </span><br/>
</li> <li>es kommt nicht genug Geld zusammen und wir müssen zurück. Auch der schnellste Rückweg ist ca siebentausend Kilometer lang auf denen das Auto gesehen wird. Geschichten gibt es genug für Buch und Film, die gesammelten Daten umfassen aktuell ca 500 GB.</li>
<li>wir müssen aus Krankheitsgründen abbrechen, das Auto zurück lassen und nach Hause fliegen. Für den Transport und die Versorgung sind wir versichert. In diesem Fall werden wir uns bemühen unsere Reise später fortzusetzen<span style=""background-color: initial;"">, denn wir sind noch lange nicht reisemüde.</span>
</li> </ul><h3>Was kommt nach Südostasien?</h3><div>Und wie finanzieren wir den weiteren Weg, denn wir wollen ja um die ganze Welt. </div><div>Wir haben uns eine Einnahmequelle über das Internet vorbereitet. Diese funktioniert gut und wir haben davon auch schon vor einigen Jahren gelebt, dann aber wieder in die Sicherheit von Jobs gewechselt. Diese Sache braucht etwas Zeit anzulaufen und wir arbeiten mit Hochdruck daran. Uns fehlt effektiv das Geld für ca  zweieinhalb Monate. Wenn diese Kampagne erfolgreich ist, klappt alles und wir sind im Rennen für die restliche Welt.</div><h3>Kein Geld..</h3><div>bedeutet nicht dass du uns nicht unterstützen kannst. Teile unsere Kampagnen auf Facebook,  Google Plus und den vielen anderen Netzwerken. Indiegogo hat dafür eine Funktion auf der Seite. Erzähle auch deinen Freunden von uns, denn oft muss nur die richtige Person von einem Projekt hören. Auch damit hilfst du uns sehr und wir sind dir sehr dankbar.</div><div>Solltest du trotzdem finanziell weiterhelfen wollen, aber kein Paypal Konto besitzen, schreib uns einfach eine email (summersun.at@gmail.com) wir finden sicher eine Lösung. </div><div>Go Indiegogo go - please keep us going :)</div><div>

<h3>Around..</h3>
<p>the world, that's the plan. We, Andrea and Klaus Gattringer both thirty-three years old from Innsbruck/Austria, married for a year and a couple for twelve more, have started to turn this plan into reality. Having adventures, seeing the world as it really is, meeting people to tell their stories. Travelling without prejudices,to say yes more often then no, that's what we have set out to do and what we have done up until now. And we want to bring Austria on the landscape, as a friendly country with friendly people.</p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<h3>For Two months and 13.000 kilometres...</h3>
<p>are we on the road now and have had many adventures. Frequently we reached our limits, physically as well as psychologically. Both good and bad, and we have grown with it. What we lived through is captured in film, photo and whenever we have sufficient internet we blog, post to Facebook and Instagram. </p>
<p>And we want to go on.</p>

<h3>Sponsoring / Crowdfunding</h3>
<p>Unfortunately we have a problem because one of our sponsorings did not work out. But giving up was never an option for us and we don't start now.  For this reason we have decided to start a crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo.</p>
<h3>Our goals</h3>
<p>A big milestone for us is reaching South East Asia  (Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, ...), this is the main goal of this campaign. We just left the north-east of Kazakhstan and we are back in Russia. Ahead of us there are eight thousand kilometres through Russia, the hardly developed Mongolia and the restrictive China. If this campaign overshoots the campaign target the money is invested into the transfer to South America, with Australia in between. The trip through China (veeeery expensive) is already paid by us . If the crowdfunding fails, this money is lost which would be very sad.</p>
<ul>
<li>At the end of our trip we are going tell the story of our journey as a book and a movie. Free, for everybody. We will post it on Youtube, Facebook, Amazon and all other platforms we can lay our hands on</li>
<li>The book will be available in English as well as in German and the movie will have subtitles wherever necessary in English.<span style=""background-color: initial;"">  </span>
</li>
<li>Our second goal is to represent our country. The small, beautiful Austria. We, both proud of our country, want to show Austria as the friendly country, with friendly people it is.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1439459297/zzoptaetly9vu2mph0fa.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<div>
<h3>For our sponsors</h3>
<p>Naturally we want to give something back for the money we get. Movie- and book credits are a part of it, as well as advertising spaces on our car. </p>
<p>The body of the car is covered in 4000 stickers (sticker bombing). Because of its ""design"" the car gathers curiosity everywhere, its photographed and filmed all the time. The cow skull we found in Kazakhstan and mounted to the hood just adds to its fabulous design  and is the icing on the cake.</p>
<p>For our sponsors we have reserved spaces in the side-windows of the car, the rear window and on the hood of the car. Individually we can make a deal for a whole window, or a part of it (please contact us).</p>
<p>The solar panels in the side windows, which are no longer working,  will be clad with felt, like you see in one of the pictures. So your ad will be much more accentuated.</p>
<p>According to this also the foil on the hood will be removed. On the dark grey surface a colourful ad will be nicely visible. </p>
<p>With us your advertising or a message goes around the world, as part of a unique car and an amazing journey.</p>
<p>We can print a graphic you mail us on our Canon Selphy Photoprinter and glue it into the car. If you prefer to send us a sticker we are going to provide you with the adress of an accomodation, most likely in Russia, where we stay for a timeframe to fetch parcels. As shipment service we recommend DHL or FED-EX.<br/></p>
<h4>Notice for our English sponsors: </h4>
<p>To avoid confusion we put the perks (Indiegogo packages) only in German online. We will happily explain the details of the packages individually in English, please contact us on </p>

<p></p>
<h3>Other possibilities</h3>
<p>What else can we do? A proposal for your girlfriend, written into the sand of a beautiful lonely beach, photographed, filmed, cut and send to you? Pictures from a beautiful place you always wanted to see yourself? Or do you want  to challenge us (you don' t dare to...) . Everything is possible. Write us on </p>
<p> summersun.at@gmail.com</p>and we'll see what we can do.</div>
<div>
<h3>How do we use the money?</h3>
<p>For 8000-9000 km, the next milestone of our journey which lasts for 2.5 months, we need approx 1000 EUR for gas. </p>
<p>Then we need some visa for SEA - we budget 400 EUR for them. </p>
<p>Our monthly costs of living are approx. 900 EUR. </p>
<p>This sums up to 3650 EUR for 2.5 months, the rest is for Indiegogo fees</p>
</div>
<div>
<br/><h3>Our mission</h3>
<p>Apart from having adventures we want to make the world more tangible, far from news which live from telling bad things, far from the mainstream. We want to show friendship and beautiful nature, great places, the usual and the unusual things. </p>
<p>We want to help building bridges. Bridges to countries, places and people one never sees in the news, a tourist will never see either. To accomplish this we have our car, a Chrysler Voyager AWD, equipped with everything we need for our daily life.</p>

<h3>Are there any risks?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Its possible that our car gets damaged to the point of destruction, by an accident or due to a mechanical fault.

Within the last thirteen thousand kilometres the only major problem we had was a broken drive shaft, but there is no guaranty.</li>
<li>we can't collect enough money and have to turn around. Even the fastest way home is a distance of over seven thousand kilometres where the car gets seen.

</li>
<li> we have to stop because of illness, leave the car behind and fly back home. For the transport and all costs related to illness we have an insurance. In this case we will try to come back and travel on as soon as possible. We are still not tired of travelling.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What happens after South East Asia?</h3>
<p>And how do we pay for the journey, as we want to go all around the world. </p>
<p>We have prepared a source of income via the internet.

Einmal..
 um die Welt, das ist der Plan. Wir, Andrea und Klaus Gattringer beide dreiunddreißig Jahre alt aus Innsbruck/Österreich, seit einem Jahr verheiratet und seit dreizehn Jahren ein Paar, sind los gezogen um diesen Plan Wirklichkeit werden zu lassen. Abenteuer erleben, die Welt sehen wie sie wirklich ist, Menschen treffen um Ihre Geschichten zu erzählen. Unvoreingenommen reisen, öfter Ja als Nein sagen, dass haben wir uns vorgenommen und umgesetzt. Und Österreich wollen wir transportieren, als freundliches Land mit freundlichen Menschen.Zwei Monate und 13.000 Kilometer...sind wir unterwegs und haben viel erlebt. Wir haben oft unsere Limits erreicht, physisch, wie psychisch. Im Guten und auch im Schlechten, daran sind wir gewachsen. Was wir erlebt haben ist in Film und Foto festgehalten und wo immer wir ausreichendes Internet haben, füttern wir unseren Blog, posten auf Facebook und Instagram. Und wir wollen weiter.

Sponsoring bzw. Crowdfunding Leider haben wir ein Problem, denn eines unserer Sponsorings hat nicht funktioniert. Aufgeben hat aber noch nie zu unseren Stärken gehört, sonst wären wir nicht dort wo wir sind. Daher haben wir uns entschlossen eine Crowdfunding Kampagne auf indiegogo zu starten. Unser ZieleEin großes Etappenziel ist das erreichen von Südostasien (Thailand, Laos, Kambodscha, ...), dass ist das Hauptziel dieser Crowdfunding Kampagne . Wir haben gerade den Nordosten von  Kasachstan verlassen und sind wieder in Russland. Vor uns liegen mehr als achttausend Kilometer durch Russland, die kaum erschlossene Mongolei und das restriktive China. Wenn diese Kampagne das Kampagnenziel übersteigen sollte fließt dieses Geld in die Passage nach Südamerika, mit Zwischenziel Australien (die mit den Kängurus :) ). Die Durchfahrt durch China (seeeeehr teuer) haben wir im Vorfeld schon bezahlt. Klappt das Crowdfunding nicht, verlieren wir dieses Geld und das wäre sehr schade.

Wir werden am Ende unserer Reise diese als Buch und Film veröffentlichen. Kostenfrei, für alle. Auf Youtube, Facebook, Amazon und allen anderen Plattformen die wir in die Finger bekommen.  

Unser zweites Ziel ist es unser Land zu repräsentieren. Das kleine, schöne Österreich. Wir, beide stolz auf unser Land, wollen Österreich als das freundliche Land vermitteln dass es auch ist. 



Warum geht ihr nicht einfach arbeiten?Das ist natürlich eine legitime Frage. Natürlich wollen wir unser Reisebudget mit Arbeitspausen, mitunter in Südoasasien, aufbessern. Das Problem ist im momentan dass wir eine fest gebuchte Durchfahrt durch China haben, die ca ein Monat dauert und am 14. September startet. Davor müssen wir noch durch die ganze Mongolei, es fehlt uns dadurch die Zeit zu stoppen. Wir haben diese Durchfahrt vor längerer Zeit gebucht, nicht wissend dass uns das in eine Zwickmühle bringen wird. 
Für unsere SponsorenWir wollen natürlich eine Gegenleistung erbringen für das Geld. Film- und Buchcredits gehören dazu, als auch Flächen für Werbung auf unserem Auto. Das Auto ist mit 4000 Stickern (Stickerbombing) planiert. Dadurch zieht es  die Aufmerksamkeit auf sich, wird fotografiert und gefilmt. Der verblichene Kuhschädel den wir in Kasachstan auf die Motorhaube montiert haben ist die Kirsche auf der Torte. Unsere Sponsoren bekommen nun Plätze für ihre Werbung in den Seitenscheiben, der Heckscheibe und auf der Motorhaube des Autos. Individuell kann auch eine ganze Scheibe oder ein Teil davon vereinbart werden (bitte um Kontakt). Die seitlichen Solarzellen Marke Eigenbau, die leider nie wie gut funktioniert haben und inzwischen durch Temperatur und Erschütterung kaputt sind, werden mit Filz in Signalfarben verkleidet, wie auf einem der Fotos ersichtlich. So kommt die Werbung zu Geltung. Die Folie auf der Motorhaube wird entfernt, darunter ist das Auto Dunkelgrau Metallic. Farbenfrohe Werbung sticht auf diesem Untergrund heraus.Deine Werbung oder eine Botschaft die du vermitteln willst, geht so um die Welt, ist Teil eines einzigartigen Fahrzeugs und einer unglaublichen Reise. Gerne drucken wir eine Grafik oder Werbung auf unserem Canon Selphy Fotodrucker aus und kleben diese ins Auto. Wenn du uns einen Aufkleber lieber zusenden möchtest geben wir rechtzeitig vor Ablauf der Kampagne die Adresse einer Unterkunft, vermutlich in Russland, bekannt. Als Zustelldienst empfehlen wir DHL oder FED-EX.



Weitere MöglichkeitenWas können wir noch umsetzen? Ein Heiratsantrag für die Freundin in den Sand eines traumhaften, einsamen Strands geschrieben - fotografiert, gefilmt, geschnitten und an dich übermittelt? Fotos und Film von einem Platz den du immer sehen wolltest? Oder willst du uns herausfordern  (Ihr traut euch nie...) . Alles möglich. Machen wir uns was aus, schreib uns auf summersun.at@gmail.comWie nutzen wir das Geld? Für 8000-9000 km, den nächsten Streckenteil der sich auf ca 2.5 Monate erstreckt, werden wir ca 1000 EUR an Benzin verbrauchen. Dazu kommen die Kosten für Visa in Südostasien - wir kalkulieren dafür 400 EUR ein. Die monatlichen Lebenskosten für uns liegen bei ca 900 EUR. Es ergeben sich 3650 EUR für 2.5 Monate, der Rest entfällt auf Indiegogo Gebühren.Unsere MissionAbgesehen davon Abenteuer zu erleben möchten wir unseren Beitrag leisten die Welt greifbarer zu machen, abseits von Nachrichten die meist Negatives berichten, abseits vom Mainstram. Wir wollen über Freundschaft schreiben und über wunderbare Natur, über Erstaunliches und Gewöhnliches, dass fernab von daheim dennoch oft sehr ungewöhnlich ist. Wir wollen damit  helfen Brücken zu bauen. Brücken zu Ländern, Orten und Menschen die man nie in den Nachrichten sieht, die ein Tourist nie zu Gesicht bekommt. Dazu haben wir unser Auto, einen alten Chrysler Voyager Allrad, mit allem darin, was wir zum Leben brauchen.Österreich ist unbekanntUnser zweites Ziel ist es unser Land zu transportieren. Das kleine, schöne Österreich. Österreich,  liebe Mit-ÖsterreicherInnen und liebe Tourismusbüros, ist relativ unbekannt. Mit viel Pantomime, Google Translate und dem klassischen Wörterbuch haben wir wohl schon etliche Male erklärt wo unsere Alpenrepublik zu finden ist, und dass es bei uns keine Kängurus gibt. Mag in den größeren Städten vielleicht noch der Name der Republik den Menschen etwas sagen, sind wir spätestens in den kleineren Orten und Gemeinden das Dorfgespräch. Wir schütteln viele Hände und umarmen Menschen. Die vielleicht ersten Österreicher die diese Menschen getroffen haben waren nett, dass bleibt im Kopf.Welche Risiken gibt es? 

Wir schrotten unser Auto, sei es durch Unfall oder einen mechanischen K.O.. Das wäre schlecht für Sponsoren mit Werbung auf dem Auto aber das gehört dazu und es kann passieren. Dreizehntausend Kilometer lang ist abgesehen von einer gerissenen Antriebswelle nicht viel passiert aber Garantie gibt es keine. 
 es kommt nicht genug Geld zusammen und wir müssen zurück. Auch der schnellste Rückweg ist ca siebentausend Kilometer lang auf denen das Auto gesehen wird. Geschichten gibt es genug für Buch und Film, die gesammelten Daten umfassen aktuell ca 500 GB.
wir müssen aus Krankheitsgründen abbrechen, das Auto zurück lassen und nach Hause fliegen. Für den Transport und die Versorgung sind wir versichert. In diesem Fall werden wir uns bemühen unsere Reise später fortzusetzen, denn wir sind noch lange nicht reisemüde.
 Was kommt nach Südostasien?Und wie finanzieren wir den weiteren Weg, denn wir wollen ja um die ganze Welt. Wir haben uns eine Einnahmequelle über das Internet vorbereitet. Diese funktioniert gut und wir haben davon auch schon vor einigen Jahren gelebt, dann aber wieder in die Sicherheit von Jobs gewechselt. Diese Sache braucht etwas Zeit anzulaufen und wir arbeiten mit Hochdruck daran. Uns fehlt effektiv das Geld für ca  zweieinhalb Monate. Wenn diese Kampagne erfolgreich ist, klappt alles und wir sind im Rennen für die restliche Welt.Kein Geld..bedeutet nicht dass du uns nicht unterstützen kannst. Teile unsere Kampagnen auf Facebook,  Google Plus und den vielen anderen Netzwerken. Indiegogo hat dafür eine Funktion auf der Seite. Erzähle auch deinen Freunden von uns, denn oft muss nur die richtige Person von einem Projekt hören. Auch damit hilfst du uns sehr und wir sind dir sehr dankbar.Solltest du trotzdem finanziell weiterhelfen wollen, aber kein Paypal Konto besitzen, schreib uns einfach eine email (summersun.at@gmail.com) wir finden sicher eine Lösung. Go Indiegogo go - please keep us going :)

Around..
the world, that's the plan. We, Andrea and Klaus Gattringer both thirty-three years old from Innsbruck/Austria, married for a year and a couple for twelve more, have started to turn this plan into reality. Having adventures, seeing the world as it really is, meeting people to tell their stories. Travelling without prejudices,to say yes more often then no, that's what we have set out to do and what we have done up until now. And we want to bring Austria on the landscape, as a friendly country with friendly people.



For Two months and 13.000 kilometres...
are we on the road now and have had many adventures. Frequently we reached our limits, physically as well as psychologically. Both good and bad, and we have grown with it. What we lived through is captured in film, photo and whenever we have sufficient internet we blog, post to Facebook and Instagram. 
And we want to go on.






Sponsoring / Crowdfunding
Unfortunately we have a problem because one of our sponsorings did not work out. But giving up was never an option for us and we don't start now.  For this reason we have decided to start a crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo.
Our goals
A big milestone for us is reaching South East Asia  (Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, ...), this is the main goal of this campaign. We just left the north-east of Kazakhstan and we are back in Russia. Ahead of us there are eight thousand kilometres through Russia, the hardly developed Mongolia and the restrictive China. If this campaign overshoots the campaign target the money is invested into the transfer to South America, with Australia in between. The trip through China (veeeery expensive) is already paid by us . If the crowdfunding fails, this money is lost which would be very sad.

At the end of our trip we are going tell the story of our journey as a book and a movie. Free, for everybody. We will post it on Youtube, Facebook, Amazon and all other platforms we can lay our hands on
The book will be available in English as well as in German and the movie will have subtitles wherever necessary in English.  

Our second goal is to represent our country. The small, beautiful Austria. We, both proud of our country, want to show Austria as the friendly country, with friendly people it is.



For our sponsors
Naturally we want to give something back for the money we get. Movie- and book credits are a part of it, as well as advertising spaces on our car. 
The body of the car is covered in 4000 stickers (sticker bombing). Because of its ""design"" the car gathers curiosity everywhere, its photographed and filmed all the time. The cow skull we found in Kazakhstan and mounted to the hood just adds to its fabulous design  and is the icing on the cake.
For our sponsors we have reserved spaces in the side-windows of the car, the rear window and on the hood of the car. Individually we can make a deal for a whole window, or a part of it (please contact us).
The solar panels in the side windows, which are no longer working,  will be clad with felt, like you see in one of the pictures. So your ad will be much more accentuated.
According to this also the foil on the hood will be removed. On the dark grey surface a colourful ad will be nicely visible. 
With us your advertising or a message goes around the world, as part of a unique car and an amazing journey.
We can print a graphic you mail us on our Canon Selphy Photoprinter and glue it into the car. If you prefer to send us a sticker we are going to provide you with the adress of an accomodation, most likely in Russia, where we stay for a timeframe to fetch parcels. As shipment service we recommend DHL or FED-EX.
Notice for our English sponsors: 
To avoid confusion we put the perks (Indiegogo packages) only in German online. We will happily explain the details of the packages individually in English, please contact us on 
summersun.at@gmail.com









Other possibilities
What else can we do? A proposal for your girlfriend, written into the sand of a beautiful lonely beach, photographed, filmed, cut and send to you? Pictures from a beautiful place you always wanted to see yourself? Or do you want  to challenge us (you don' t dare to...) . Everything is possible. Write us on 
 summersun.at@gmail.comand we'll see what we can do.

How do we use the money?
For 8000-9000 km, the next milestone of our journey which lasts for 2.5 months, we need approx 1000 EUR for gas. 
Then we need some visa for SEA - we budget 400 EUR for them. 
Our monthly costs of living are approx. 900 EUR. 
This sums up to 3650 EUR for 2.5 months, the rest is for Indiegogo fees


Our mission
Apart from having adventures we want to make the world more tangible, far from news which live from telling bad things, far from the mainstream. We want to show friendship and beautiful nature, great places, the usual and the unusual things. 
We want to help building bridges. Bridges to countries, places and people one never sees in the news, a tourist will never see either. To accomplish this we have our car, a Chrysler Voyager AWD, equipped with everything we need for our daily life.




Austria isn't a well known place
Our second goal is to bring our country, Austria, on the maps. The small, beautiful Austria. With a lot of pantomime, Google Translate and the classic dictionary we have described a lot of times where to find our little alpine republic and that there are no kangaroos around.
Whilst in bigger towns some people may know where to put us, we are the gossip of the day in smaller towns and villages. We shake many hands and hug a lot of people. The very first Austrians some people may ever have met where friendly and we hope that this sticks to the mind.




Are there any risks?

Its possible that our car gets damaged to the point of destruction, by an accident or due to a mechanical fault. This would be bad for our sponsors with advertising on the car, but sadly it can happen and it is a possible risk. Within the last thirteen thousand kilometres the only major problem we had was a broken drive shaft, but there is no guaranty.
we can't collect enough money and have to turn around. Even the fastest way home is a distance of over seven thousand kilometres where the car gets seen. Stories are sufficient enough for a book as well as a movie, as we have so far collected over 500GB of data. 

 we have to stop because of illness, leave the car behind and fly back home. For the transport and all costs related to illness we have an insurance. In this case we will try to come back and travel on as soon as possible. We are still not tired of travelling.

What happens after South East Asia?
And how do we pay for the journey, as we want to go all around the world. 
We have prepared a source of income via the internet. This source works well and we used to live on it some years ago, but later changed into the security of jobs.  But this source needs some time to kick off and we work on it all the time. We effectively lack the money to get us through a time frame of approximately two and a half months.  If this campaign is successful, the rest works out and we are back in the race to go around the world.

</div><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><b><u>HAVE YOU
SEEN THE NEWS LATELY?</u></b></p>
<p>Everywhere you look, Russia and its military are making headlines:</p>
<p><span>&gt;  </span>Dropping bombs in Syria</p>
<p><span>&gt;  </span>Flying into Turkish, Swedish, and British airspace (among others)</p>
<p><span>&gt;  </span>Dominating events in Ukraine</p>
<p>How can we explain this behaviour? 
It seems as though Russia has suddenly turned aggressive for no good
reason – but is this true?</p>
<p>My name is Ted Seay, and I’m very worried.</p>
<p>Worried that certain world leaders seem interested in reviving the Cold
War.</p>
<p>Worried that there are politicians and generals out there who still
think that fighting and winning a nuclear war is actually possible.</p>
<p>Most of all, though, I’m concerned that all of these worries could be
turned into realities by the 180 American nuclear bombs which are based in
Europe.  These B61 gravity bombs<a rel=""noopener nofollow""><span><span><span>[1]</span></span></span></a>,
which most people in Europe are not even aware of, are a hidden cause of huge
tension between Russia and the West.  People
in all five countries where these U.S. bombs are based would also be concerned,
if they only knew the tremendous costs and dangers associated with these
weapons.</p>
<p>As I said, I’m Ted Seay, and my organisation, BASIC, the British
American Security Information Council, aims to do something about this
problem.  That’s why we have organised this
Indiegogo campaign to send U.S. nuclear gravity bombs back home where they
belong.</p>
<p><b><u>THE REAL
PROBLEM</u></b></p>
<p>American nuclear weapons on bases in Europe are a totally unnecessary,
expensive, dangerous catalyst to EU-Russia confrontation.  NATO’s 28 members cannot reach a consensus to
send the bombs back home to the U.S.<a rel=""noopener nofollow""><span><span><span>[2]</span></span></span></a>,
and the Obama administration cannot or will not do anything about them, either<a rel=""noopener nofollow""><span><span>[3]</span></span></a>.  That means it has to be up to the five NATO countries
where these bombs are based to order the U.S. government to take them home –
and that’s where BASIC and this campaign come in.</p>
<p>Today, B61 nuclear bombs can be carried from America by the long-range
U.S. stealth bomber, the B-2, to attack targets anywhere on earth<a rel=""noopener nofollow""><span><span><span>[4]</span></span></span></a>
– so why does NATO plan to load these same bombs in short-range fighter
aircraft, such as F-16s, which only have a combat radius of a few hundred
miles?<a rel=""noopener nofollow""><span><span>[5]</span></span></a></p>
<p>Back when B61 bombs were based in West Germany, and their targets were
Soviet tank armies in East Germany, 250 miles away at most, delivering them by short-range
fighter jet was at least possible. 
Today, there are no targets outside the EU reachable without dangerous,
slow and expensive midair refuelling – and let’s not forget that other NATO
aircraft would have to fly ahead of the B61s and blow up enemy air defences
first.</p>
<p>This whole idea is so crazy, and so hard for Russia to believe, let
alone fear, that NATO has taken to calling the B61s in Europe “political
weapons”.  There’s just one problem –
they don’t work politically, either.</p>
<p>All 28 NATO countries must agree to release nuclear weapons to NATO’s
military authorities during a crisis, and there are strong indications that
this could never happen, <u>especially</u> during a crisis.  Germany would not want to go on record as
having approved a nuclear attack on Russia from Büchel air base, nor would
Turkey agree to a nuclear attack on Iran from İncirlik air base.</p>
<p>The other real problem with the whole NATO scenario is that preparing
NATO F-16 and Tornado attack aircraft to carry B61 bombs now requires several <u>weeks</u>
of lead time – hardly useful in a crisis.</p>
<p>So – if you were Russia, how would you feel about NATO?  When you believed you had been promised, as
early as 1990, that NATO would not expand even “one inch to the east”<a rel=""noopener nofollow""><span><span><span>[6]</span></span></span></a>?  Especially after you announced, publicly and
repeatedly, that you were against any NATO expansion that involved your
immediate neighbours, like Georgia or Ukraine, yet had those statements
ignored, when NATO promised both countries in 2008 that they would become
members of NATO<a rel=""noopener nofollow""><span><span>[7]</span></span></a>?  Would you be inclined to believe NATO when it
said B61s were not aimed at Russia?  Or
would you be sceptical?</p>
<p>Two other quick points:  First, what
about Russia’s short-range nuclear weapons? 
We want to get rid of them, too – but there is a fundamental difference
between Russia’s short-range nukes, which are located in Russia, and America’s
short-range nukes, which are located all over Europe.  BASIC believes that, once U.S. B61s are back
home where they belong, serious negotiations can begin with Russia on, first,
moving their short-range nuclear weapons out of range of targets in Europe
(beyond the Ural Mountains, for example, where they would not threaten any
other countries, either).</p>
<p>Finally, it must be pointed out that the 180 B61s, however much money is
being spent on guarding them, represent an extremely tempting target for
terrorists looking to outdo the 11 September 2001 or 7 July 2005 attacks<a rel=""noopener nofollow""><span><span><span>[8]</span></span></span></a>.
 The safest place for them by far is back
in America.</p>
<p><b><u>WHAT BASIC CAN
DO</u></b></p>
<p>BASIC has a cost-saving, efficient plan for dealing with U.S. B61 bombs
in Europe, and as the UK’s oldest organisation working exclusively on this
issue, we have the expert knowledge and experience to make it work.</p>
<p>In November 2013, I went to The Hague to brief Dutch Members of
Parliament about the B61 bombs stored at Kleine Brogel air base.  The result of one brief visit to the
Netherlands by one BASIC representative?  A week after hearing my briefing points, the
Dutch Parliament voted to refuse to certify future Dutch F-35 fighter-bombers
to carry B61s – a demonstration of the power of information.</p>
<p>Dutch Members of Parliament were lied to by their government that NATO
nuclear issues were classified and couldn’t be discussed in Parliament.  When they heard the facts in our briefings,
MPs in the Netherlands took action.  We
at BASIC are very concerned that these lies may also be used by other host
governments – and we aim to find out.</p>
<p>We are financing our BANish The Bombs 2015 lobbying campaign on a
shoestring – as we collect each £10,000, we will plan and execute briefings for
Parliamentarians and anti-nuclear activists in another of NATO’s five B61
“host” nations: Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Turkey.  If we reach our goal of £50,000, this crucial
information will have reached them all.</p>
<p>While in the five NATO capitals, we will present Parliamentarians with
the documented truth about B61 bombs, U.S. government plans to upgrade them at
enormous cost, and the importance of getting the entire class of antiquated
weapons out of Europe, starting with U.S. bombs which are a long way from home.</p>
<p><b><u>HOW YOU CAN HELP</u></b></p>
<p>We’re not asking for much, and frankly in terms of perks and fancy
giveaways, we’re not offering much, either.<a rel=""noopener nofollow""><span><span><span>[9]</span></span></span></a></p>
<p>What we ARE offering is the chance for you and your friends to make a
difference.  The next time you’re down at
the pub with friends, challenge them to #ForgoAFiver – instead of chipping in
for the next round, set £5 aside for BANish The Bombs 2015.  Then let your friends know what you’re doing
and why, and encourage them to check out #BANishTheBombs2015 and this campaign.</p>
<p>So that’s it – if you can #ForgoAFiver,
you can help us send the B61s, creaky relics of the 1950s, back to the U.S. for
recycling.  Among other things, this
will:</p>
<p>&gt; Send a strong message to Non-Nuclear Weapons States
that NATO and Europe are serious about the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty
(NPT)</p>
<p>&gt; Remove a major thorn from NATO-Russia relations</p>
<p>&gt; Allow meaningful discussions to begin on getting Russia’s
short-range nuclear weapons out of Europe, too</p>

SEEN THE NEWS LATELY?
Everywhere you look, Russia and its military are making headlines:
>  Dropping bombs in Syria
>  Flying into Turkish, Swedish, and British airspace (among others)
>  Dominating events in Ukraine
How can we explain this behaviour? 
It seems as though Russia has suddenly turned aggressive for no good
reason – but is this true?
My name is Ted Seay, and I’m very worried.
Worried that certain world leaders seem interested in reviving the Cold
War.
Worried that there are politicians and generals out there who still
think that fighting and winning a nuclear war is actually possible.
Most of all, though, I’m concerned that all of these worries could be
turned into realities by the 180 American nuclear bombs which are based in
Europe.  These B61 gravity bombs[1],
which most people in Europe are not even aware of, are a hidden cause of huge
tension between Russia and the West.  People
in all five countries where these U.S. bombs are based would also be concerned,
if they only knew the tremendous costs and dangers associated with these
weapons.
As I said, I’m Ted Seay, and my organisation, BASIC, the British
American Security Information Council, aims to do something about this
problem.  That’s why we have organised this
Indiegogo campaign to send U.S. nuclear gravity bombs back home where they
belong.
THE REAL
PROBLEM
American nuclear weapons on bases in Europe are a totally unnecessary,
expensive, dangerous catalyst to EU-Russia confrontation.  NATO’s 28 members cannot reach a consensus to
send the bombs back home to the U.S.[2],
and the Obama administration cannot or will not do anything about them, either[3].  That means it has to be up to the five NATO countries
where these bombs are based to order the U.S. government to take them home –
and that’s where BASIC and this campaign come in.
Today, B61 nuclear bombs can be carried from America by the long-range
U.S. stealth bomber, the B-2, to attack targets anywhere on earth[4]
– so why does NATO plan to load these same bombs in short-range fighter
aircraft, such as F-16s, which only have a combat radius of a few hundred
miles?[5]
Back when B61 bombs were based in West Germany, and their targets were
Soviet tank armies in East Germany, 250 miles away at most, delivering them by short-range
fighter jet was at least possible. 
Today, there are no targets outside the EU reachable without dangerous,
slow and expensive midair refuelling – and let’s not forget that other NATO
aircraft would have to fly ahead of the B61s and blow up enemy air defences
first.
This whole idea is so crazy, and so hard for Russia to believe, let
alone fear, that NATO has taken to calling the B61s in Europe “political
weapons”.  There’s just one problem –
they don’t work politically, either.
All 28 NATO countries must agree to release nuclear weapons to NATO’s
military authorities during a crisis, and there are strong indications that
this could never happen, especially during a crisis.  Germany would not want to go on record as
having approved a nuclear attack on Russia from Büchel air base, nor would
Turkey agree to a nuclear attack on Iran from İncirlik air base.
The other real problem with the whole NATO scenario is that preparing
NATO F-16 and Tornado attack aircraft to carry B61 bombs now requires several weeks
of lead time – hardly useful in a crisis.
So – if you were Russia, how would you feel about NATO?  When you believed you had been promised, as
early as 1990, that NATO would not expand even “one inch to the east”[6]?  Especially after you announced, publicly and
repeatedly, that you were against any NATO expansion that involved your
immediate neighbours, like Georgia or Ukraine, yet had those statements
ignored, when NATO promised both countries in 2008 that they would become
members of NATO[7]?  Would you be inclined to believe NATO when it
said B61s were not aimed at Russia?  Or
would you be sceptical?
Two other quick points:  First, what
about Russia’s short-range nuclear weapons? 
We want to get rid of them, too – but there is a fundamental difference
between Russia’s short-range nukes, which are located in Russia, and America’s
short-range nukes, which are located all over Europe.  BASIC believes that, once U.S. B61s are back
home where they belong, serious negotiations can begin with Russia on, first,
moving their short-range nuclear weapons out of range of targets in Europe
(beyond the Ural Mountains, for example, where they would not threaten any
other countries, either).
Finally, it must be pointed out that the 180 B61s, however much money is
being spent on guarding them, represent an extremely tempting target for
terrorists looking to outdo the 11 September 2001 or 7 July 2005 attacks[8].
 The safest place for them by far is back
in America.
WHAT BASIC CAN
DO
BASIC has a cost-saving, efficient plan for dealing with U.S. B61 bombs
in Europe, and as the UK’s oldest organisation working exclusively on this
issue, we have the expert knowledge and experience to make it work.
In November 2013, I went to The Hague to brief Dutch Members of
Parliament about the B61 bombs stored at Kleine Brogel air base.  The result of one brief visit to the
Netherlands by one BASIC representative?  A week after hearing my briefing points, the
Dutch Parliament voted to refuse to certify future Dutch F-35 fighter-bombers
to carry B61s – a demonstration of the power of information.
Dutch Members of Parliament were lied to by their government that NATO
nuclear issues were classified and couldn’t be discussed in Parliament.  When they heard the facts in our briefings,
MPs in the Netherlands took action.  We
at BASIC are very concerned that these lies may also be used by other host
governments – and we aim to find out.
We are financing our BANish The Bombs 2015 lobbying campaign on a
shoestring – as we collect each £10,000, we will plan and execute briefings for
Parliamentarians and anti-nuclear activists in another of NATO’s five B61
“host” nations: Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Turkey.  If we reach our goal of £50,000, this crucial
information will have reached them all.
While in the five NATO capitals, we will present Parliamentarians with
the documented truth about B61 bombs, U.S. government plans to upgrade them at
enormous cost, and the importance of getting the entire class of antiquated
weapons out of Europe, starting with U.S. bombs which are a long way from home.
HOW YOU CAN HELP
We’re not asking for much, and frankly in terms of perks and fancy
giveaways, we’re not offering much, either.[9]
What we ARE offering is the chance for you and your friends to make a
difference.  The next time you’re down at
the pub with friends, challenge them to #ForgoAFiver – instead of chipping in
for the next round, set £5 aside for BANish The Bombs 2015.  Then let your friends know what you’re doing
and why, and encourage them to check out #BANishTheBombs2015 and this campaign.
So that’s it – if you can #ForgoAFiver,
you can help us send the B61s, creaky relics of the 1950s, back to the U.S. for
recycling.  Among other things, this
will:
> Send a strong message to Non-Nuclear Weapons States
that NATO and Europe are serious about the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty
(NPT)
> Remove a major thorn from NATO-Russia relations
> Allow meaningful discussions to begin on getting Russia’s
short-range nuclear weapons out of Europe, too
#ForgoAFiver
#BANishTheBombs2015...and let's not overlook the alternative to getting B61 nuclear bombs out of Europe:  NATO To Return to Cold War Nuclear Drills?---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<p>The Spirit of the Age is a film and multi-platform production that will paint a vibrant picture of the Roaring Twenties at its inception. Jazz is new in the early 1920s.

<p>We have arranged for the film's premiere and distribution through PBS station WQPT, created a non-profit association (contact us at <a href=""mailto:info@thespiritoftheage.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">info@thespiritoftheage.com</a> for information about making a tax-deductible contribution) and have filmed a teaser with more than thirty crew, actors and musicians. We are poised to develop a unique production that will inspire, entertain, inform and foster critical thinking. <span><br/></span> </p>

<p>The risks and challenges of this project will be mitigated
in large part by the creative team's decades of professional experience.
For example, J. Douglas Miller has served as a producer for films featured at
the Cannes and Sundance
festivals and for a PBS mini-series.  We will contract with professional
filmmakers and media legal consultants to ensure that that outcome will be of
the highest caliber and to minimize potential problems. We are planning

<h4><b>What do you plan on doing with it once it's completed?</b></h4>
<p>As is the case with most horror shorts, it will be submitted
to genre specific festivals all over the World. </p>
<h4><b>What’s the money for?</b></h4>
<p>Wanting to produce this film at the highest quality
possible, we plan on shooting at 4k with a Red Scarlet. With a small cast, only two
locations, and a relatively small crew, we're confident that we can produce a
first rate film with the amount we're seeking. Your generous contributions will
allow us to cover all production expenses, including cast &amp; crew, equipment
rental, insurance, location fees and permits, hair &amp; make-up/SFX, catering,
and post-production expenses, which include editing, original music score,
color grading, VFX, and sound design.</p>
<h4><b>What happens if
we don't reach our goal?</b></h4>
<p>We opted for a ""flexible funding"" campaign, which
means that we'll receive all funds pledged (minus IndieGoGo &amp; Paypal fees).
Rest assured that one way or another, this film will be produced and all
contributors will receive their perks as promised.</p>
<h4><b>What happens if we raise more than our
goal?</b></h4>
<p></p><p>The amount we are seeking is the bare minimum we need to
shoot the film. Any surplus funds will go toward the hiring of additional crew
members and/or possibly adding one more day to our shooting schedule.</p>
<h4><b>When will I receive my rewards?</b></h4>
<p>IMDb credits will be almost immediate. Others will be
fulfilled once the film is completed and we're ready to submit to festivals.
(Please note that DVD copies of ""Aberrant"" &amp; ""Ghostline"" won't be shipped until
we've completed our festival run).</p>
<h4><b>Can I do anything else to help?</b></h4>
<p>Absolutely!  You can spread the word by emailing this
page link to friends and family and by posting it on Facebook and Twitter. Our
goal is to create a buzz.</p><h4><b>Who's in the cast?</b></h4><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1190637/files/20150202102827-Danielle.jpg?1422901707"" src="""" style=""width: 242.95486935867px; height: 364px;""/></p><p><b>DANIELLE LOZEAU</b></p>

everyone involved will be proud of.  But

Land an IMDb-credited ""walk-on"" role in the upcoming feature KILL ME ONCE, starring Andrew Bongiorno and Rachel Alig. Production on this supernatural thriller is scheduled for September, 2015, in San Diego .

https://www.facebook.com/pages/Kill-Me-Once/1465916927022855What is ABERRANT about?
At the onset of a rapidly-moving global pandemic in which
dead people are returning as flesh-eating abominations that can infect the
living with a single bite, Brad and Leslie take shelter in a semi-isolated
house believed to be uninhabited. But their safe haven turns into a death trap
when they encounter Nicoleta—a renegade female vampire that has also taken
refuge in the house. 
What could possibly go wrong there?
ABERRANT TEASER
What do you plan on doing with it once it's completed?
As is the case with most horror shorts, it will be submitted
to genre specific festivals all over the World. 
What’s the money for?
Wanting to produce this film at the highest quality
possible, we plan on shooting at 4k with a Red Scarlet. With a small cast, only two
locations, and a relatively small crew, we're confident that we can produce a
first rate film with the amount we're seeking. Your generous contributions will
allow us to cover all production expenses, including cast & crew, equipment
rental, insurance, location fees and permits, hair & make-up/SFX, catering,
and post-production expenses, which include editing, original music score,
color grading, VFX, and sound design.
What happens if
we don't reach our goal?
We opted for a ""flexible funding"" campaign, which
means that we'll receive all funds pledged (minus IndieGoGo & Paypal fees).
Rest assured that one way or another, this film will be produced and all
contributors will receive their perks as promised.
What happens if we raise more than our
goal?
The amount we are seeking is the bare minimum we need to
shoot the film. Any surplus funds will go toward the hiring of additional crew
members and/or possibly adding one more day to our shooting schedule.
When will I receive my rewards?
IMDb credits will be almost immediate. Others will be
fulfilled once the film is completed and we're ready to submit to festivals.
(Please note that DVD copies of ""Aberrant"" & ""Ghostline"" won't be shipped until
we've completed our festival run).
Can I do anything else to help?
Absolutely!  You can spread the word by emailing this
page link to friends and family and by posting it on Facebook and Twitter. Our
goal is to create a buzz.Who's in the cast?DANIELLE LOZEAU

everyone involved will be proud of.  But
we are more than up for the task. The only risk we face is that since the

</h3><h3>Do you honor and respect the sacrifices of Queen Harriet Tubman? Support the Chosen: Queen Moses Movement! <br/>
</h3>
<h3><br/></h3>
<p>Do you feel the shift in the air? People all over the world are tired of the system and many are rebelling because they realize that they are not truly free. They are tired of living beneath their potential and are ready to move forward and be the best that they can be. Is that You? Well, if so, it sounds like you have a little bit of Harriet Tubman running through your veins. Like you, she dealt with oppression as long as she was able to and then one day she had gotten tired of it all and decided that the only way her life would change was if she rose up, walked away from everything that didn't represent her true nature and changed it into what she wanted for herself. <br/></p>
<p>Freedom and Purpose are undeniably two important things that many people around the world don't have. Our great Ancestor, Queen Harriet, successfully navigated through this world with all odds against her and managed to figure out the secret to obtaining both! So I, Saacha Spade, believe that NOW is the time to reveal those secrets to the masses and what better way to share them then to tell her story? That's right, <b>FINALLY</b> Queen Harriet Tubman's full life story is about to be told through a 6 hour miniseries for television and YOU have the opportunity to contribute to her project! </p>
<p></p>

I often hear people complain about the type of entertainment that our children our exposed to, but when it is time to do something about it, many refuse to support people who are actually doing something to change it. Have you saw a project through the television or movie screen about our legendary Heroine, Harriet Tubman, during your life time? If you have, did it memorialize her on the level that she deserves? Well, personally I don't complain about what I am not willing to change, so instead of finding something negative to say about the movies that are being produced about our story, I decided to move forward and make sure that her story was told. <br/><p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1191543/files/20150202161250-how_did_queen_moses_begin.png?1422922370"" src="""" style=""width: 630.081px; height: 125px;""/></p>
<p> I began working on a book about her life in March of 2014 because I wanted to bring a relevant feel to her story that would help us identify with who she is in this era.  Almost 2 years later, not only have I written a novel about her but I have also written a screenplay that is moving into production in May of 2015 and additionally have developed some absolutely phenomenal products that will engage the minds of the youngest to the most mature and display the relevance of her life.  I am dedicated and committed to making sure that her name is known all over the world because she deserves all of the honor and tribute that we can give to her! This is why I am reaching out to partner with you because I'm sure you love her too and know that she has not been honored the way that she truly deserves to be. Many of the children and teenagers have no idea who she truly is or what she did to help all of us, so it is my personal objective to make sure that I do everything I can to from here on out that will help people identify with her as Queen Moses.</p>

<span>The
 Descendants Of Harriet Tubman are aware of this project and support the

Ancestor. I am extremely grateful and humbled to have their support and 
cooperation with bringing Queen Harriet's story to life for all to see and if you recognize the gravity of who she is, you should know that her Descendants take her life seriously. Her 
full story has never been told through the entertainment industry and although people have taken her legacy and disrespected her through what was supposed to be comedy, this project will make sure that she is revered the way that she deserves to be. The 
Matriarchs of the family are especially my concern because they have not
 had the peace to know that an appropriate depiction of her life story 
has been told to the masses, so please consider them as well when giving your contribution. It is my objective to bring her story to 
life in a manner that will satisfy the Matriarchs of the family and 
allow them to have assurance that her life and legacy are represented

 it.  </span><br/><p></p>

There is a lot to do and we are working extremely hard setting the stage for her to be properly memorialized today! Your participation in giving and sharing the word about the project is showing your honor to her! I am   <b>VERY</b>
 thankful for the option to use crowd funding through Indiegogo, because
 it is an awesome service that allows us as a community the ability to partner on projects that are of importance to us and get it done! I do not want to be at the mercy of trying to convince someone in the entertainment industry as to why her story is worth telling. There is a <b>MAJOR</b> demand for her story and this demand
 has not been recognized since 1978 when Queen Cicely Tyson represented her in ""A Woman Called Moses"".  <br/><p>
</p>
<p><span>Also,
 if we were not crowd funding through Indiegogo and this project was 
taken on by a major production company, I could very well lose the creative control over the story line. That would mean that scenes, characters and other very important information would be cut out from the story when I feel they deserve and need to be there.  So, Indiegogo has given us the ability to reach 
out to you, share our vision, and use 100% of the money that is raised

</p><p><u>A
Short Summary </u></p>
<p>The Boss, a power hungry, 'Capitalist King' hangs in a trash chute, waist down in filth, and he relishes every bit of it. When he is saved
by a fireman, two detectives are assigned to the case, a young woman thirsty for
justice and an old veteran ready to retire. She suspects the Boss's pleasure in this
filthy torture; but, before she can solve the mystery, he overrides her -- bringing the young detective to her death. <i>Boss </i>is
about power hungry individuals living in a Capitalist society, playing by
their own rules and who will stop at nothing to satisfy their inner needs and
desires. A very relevant film as it touches on today’s controversies regarding
power, money, and sex.</p>
<p><u>Who
We Are</u></p>
<p>Xeba
Zareie (Producer &amp; Director of Photography) – an inspired young film
student at the University of Miami. As a lover of the power of cinema, I seek
to create stories and images that resonate the true strength of this artistic
medium. My dream is to connect humanity together, using the power of these
untold perspectives. I'm sure we can all agree that we've felt that feeling, you know, when the film ends and the credits roll. When it is all over and you realize how moved you feel. Films touch and inspire people
and that is what I am striving towards in all of my work as a filmmaker.</p>
<p>Matt
Rubino (Director) – an experienced director and cinematographer. He has been
using a camera since he was a young child. His curiosity for the medium sparked
him to make his first film when he was only 9 about Legos! He is in his last
year at the graduate program at University of Miami and has just had his <i>Hard Corn</i> film get accepted to the Cine
Pobre Film Festival. </p>
<p>The
writer – prefers to remain anonymous; however, he is a veteran screenwriter,
producer, and director with more than three decades of experience in the film
industry. </p>
<p><u>The
Impact</u></p>
<p>Ø<span>  </span>The more money you guys help us to raise for the project, the
higher the production quality can be for the final cut! We want to be able to
compensate the artists for their help; as, it is important to support the
community so we can all evolve together! </p>
<p>Ø<span> 
</span>If you too believe in the importance
of our project and want to help but can't afford to contribute money, you can
still pitch in by sharing this campaign with as many people as possible: with
friends and family, on your social media and all over the Internet. Just remember
to use the indiegogo Share Tools! Raising awareness will not only help get the
word out about this important story, but you could also help someone who might
want to contribute discover our campaign. With your help, together we can make
this project a reality! </p>
<p><u>What We Need &amp; What
You Get </u></p>
<p><u></u></p>
<p>Aside from compensating all of the
actors for bringing this story to life, providing them with food and reimbursing them for their travels, we are looking to compensate engineers as well. We will be employing student engineers to help design and build the trash shoot, that will allow camera access, in which the Boss will be wedged for the opening scene.

Short Summary 
The Boss, a power hungry, 'Capitalist King' hangs in a trash chute, waist down in filth, and he relishes every bit of it. When he is saved
by a fireman, two detectives are assigned to the case, a young woman thirsty for
justice and an old veteran ready to retire. She suspects the Boss's pleasure in this
filthy torture; but, before she can solve the mystery, he overrides her -- bringing the young detective to her death. Boss is
about power hungry individuals living in a Capitalist society, playing by
their own rules and who will stop at nothing to satisfy their inner needs and
desires. A very relevant film as it touches on today’s controversies regarding
power, money, and sex.
Who
We Are
Xeba
Zareie (Producer & Director of Photography) – an inspired young film
student at the University of Miami. As a lover of the power of cinema, I seek
to create stories and images that resonate the true strength of this artistic
medium. My dream is to connect humanity together, using the power of these
untold perspectives. I'm sure we can all agree that we've felt that feeling, you know, when the film ends and the credits roll. When it is all over and you realize how moved you feel. Films touch and inspire people
and that is what I am striving towards in all of my work as a filmmaker.
Matt
Rubino (Director) – an experienced director and cinematographer. He has been
using a camera since he was a young child. His curiosity for the medium sparked
him to make his first film when he was only 9 about Legos! He is in his last
year at the graduate program at University of Miami and has just had his Hard Corn film get accepted to the Cine
Pobre Film Festival. 
The
writer – prefers to remain anonymous; however, he is a veteran screenwriter,
producer, and director with more than three decades of experience in the film
industry. 
The
Impact
Ø  The more money you guys help us to raise for the project, the
higher the production quality can be for the final cut! We want to be able to
compensate the artists for their help; as, it is important to support the
community so we can all evolve together! 
Ø 
If you too believe in the importance
of our project and want to help but can't afford to contribute money, you can
still pitch in by sharing this campaign with as many people as possible: with
friends and family, on your social media and all over the Internet. Just remember
to use the indiegogo Share Tools! Raising awareness will not only help get the
word out about this important story, but you could also help someone who might
want to contribute discover our campaign. With your help, together we can make
this project a reality! 
What We Need & What
You Get 

Aside from compensating all of the
actors for bringing this story to life, providing them with food and reimbursing them for their travels, we are looking to compensate engineers as well. We will be employing student engineers to help design and build the trash shoot, that will allow camera access, in which the Boss will be wedged for the opening scene. Additionally we will need their help and expertise to
build a toilet that will allow us to film from the hole in which waste flushes
down. Last, but not least, we will need to feed the crew on these long shoot days and provide establishments with whatever they need to let us shoot on location.",0.0,0,"5 Campaigns

<p>My name is Jonathan Nosan. I have been a professional contortionist for 20 years and teaching internationally for 10 years. I’m 46. When I started training at 22 I couldn’t touch my toes. My handstand took 3 years to learn--the flexibility and strength developed methodically though my training with Mr. Lu Yi in San Francisco. Like many of my students, I didn’t have a natural flexibility; but I did have the drive and desire to physically push myself to an extreme I knew I could possess.</p>
<p>In celebration of two decades of contorting I will film and release five 50-80 minute videos for the public to share my knowledge: 1. Contorture™ Technique 2. Inversions 3. The Contorture™ Chamber: a full start to finish group class 4. Weighted Stretching 5. Inner Sanctum: Breaking down the moves in my act. These videos will be available as a 3 Workshop Series and a 5 Workshop Series depending on your level of masochism by online streaming and/or downloads.<br/></p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>
<p>Break it down now:</p>
<p>The films will be shot in Nashville Tennessee because its the Music Capital of the World. It is also much less costly than shooting in New York City.  We have a top notch crew, cast and location in place--an 1885 tobacco, jam and hosiery  warehouse renovated to create a complete experiential and inspirational product bringing you right into our Contorture™ Chamber.</p>
<p>This is way beyond setting up an iPhone and pressing record or hiring a Fitness Video Production House. We are creating personal training sessions with Jonathan and four demonstrators/students for you to learn and train together with--all the  bells and whistles of fitness films created on a super slim budget.  </p>
<ul>
<li>The Cost Needs are simple: location rental, equipment (3 cameras, lighting, sound), director, assistant director, producer, gaffer, boom operator, editor, hair, make up, demonstrator/actors, assistants, cost of insurance, pre and post production...oh and we can't forget...taxes, legal, web and crafty (food).</li>
<li>When you donate to help us cover those costs then you will receive a perk--a present, a gift! We have sweet perks ranging from virtual high fives to awesome swag, private Skype lessons, and getting the Workshops before it is released to the public!! <br/>
</li>
<li>Okay. So lets say that we don't reach our goal. That would be sad, but okay. We will utilize the funds graciously received and make it anyway! We will not give up. This is happening and we are incredibly excited!<br/>
</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>
<p>This is a very special and important project to me. While touring the world I’m able to lead workshops and train individuals from circus, pole dance, fitness, and yoga disciplines and inevitiably their “aha” moment arrives—discovering a new pain free way of extreme movement, backbending, balance, counterbalance, and breath control. </p>
<p>I now have the time and connections to create a video series which will show and share my method of instruction and training in an environment and aesthetic you would expect from me.</p>
<p>This truly will be a workshop program I wholeheartedly can present to you in response to the years of requests for training, advice and guidance. </p>

<b>TALENT</b>: In order for this become a success, I need to hire 8 actors and a full crew. These talented artists deserve an amazing experience as well and I want to pay them for their talents and skills.  They will show up and give their best and the least I can do is give them my best too!</ul>
<ul>
<b style=""background-color: initial;"">PRODUCTION COSTS</b><span style=""background-color: initial;"">: I will need to rent out several spaces, equipment, wardrobe, and props.

</div><div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div><div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div></div>","Where's Your Boyfriend is a romantic comedy about a girl named Maggie. She's a young career oriented young woman on a mission... well sort of. After non-stop pressure from her mom to finally meet a guy, she finally does, well, sort of. Maggie invents ‘Jeffery’ to finally get her mom off her back. Hilarity ensues when she finds herself in a race against time to find a real life Jeffery. With the help of her best friend, Stella, Tinder, and a slew of New York City’s most “eligible”bachelors, can she find the man of her dreams or will she have admit to her mother that she has been lying all along? 
This story was inspired by the lovely ladies in my life (hola!) and pretty much every person who has asked me when I'm getting married (you know who you are). I had the amazing opportunity to work with screen writer, MIchael Panes. So far the feedback has been spectacular! Regardless of age or ethnicity it is something everyone can relate to. And seriously, who doesn't love a romantic comedy?! 



 Listen, making a short film ain't cheap! My short is estimated to cost about $8,000...... minimum! Luckily, I have already raised a good portion of the funds.
By giving to this campaign, I will be able to make my film amazing. This includes hiring professional actors, crew and equipment. I want the best for my production and crew! Every donation counts! Here are several specifics that I need help funding: 

TALENT: In order for this become a success, I need to hire 8 actors and a full crew. These talented artists deserve an amazing experience as well and I want to pay them for their talents and skills.  They will show up and give their best and the least I can do is give them my best too!

PRODUCTION COSTS: I will need to rent out several spaces, equipment, wardrobe, and props. I want my vision to be executed to it's fullest extend. No one likes a bad romantic comedy!
TRANSPORTATION: This one is simple. I need to get a bunch of equipment and people from location to location. 
FOOD: I don't want to starve anyone on set. They are taking time out of their busy schedules to help an up and coming director. The least I can do is feed everyone decent food!



   

Alas! I will be giving a little something back for the donations. I want to express my gratitude and show how much this really means to me! This ranges from date nights to personal thank you's. 



Any additional money that is raised that will not be used, I will donate to NO MORE, a public awareness and engagement campaign focused on ending domestic violence and sexual assault. NO MORE seeks to break social stigma, normalize the conversation around domestic violence and sexual assault, and increase resources to address these urgent issues. 


""Where's Your Boyfriend"" celebrates love, freedom and healthy relationships. Unfortunately many people will experience some sort of domestic abuse in their lifetime.  For example, 1 in 3 teens experience sexual or physical abuse or threats from a boyfriend or girlfriend in one year.  This is mind blowing and something that needs to be talked about!

Waldsterben - Der Film
Ein aufrüttelnder Thriller über zwei Jugendfreunde, die bei einem 
Wandertrip eine Mädchenleiche finden und dabei Frauenhändlern in die 
Quere kommen.

Die beiden Jugendfreunde Alex und Chris vermissen die gute alte Zeit. Von den „Jungen Wilden“ ist mittlerweile durch quengelnde Kinder und kränkelnde Eltern nicht mehr viel übrig. Also beschließen sie ihre gemeinsamen Erinnerungen bei einem zweitägigen Survivaltrip im bayerischen Wald neu aufleben zu lassen.
Nach einem stundenlangen Marsch mit intensiven Gesprächen entspannen sie am nächtlichen Lagerfeuer. Als Alex austritt um seine Notdurft zu verrichten, macht er einen grausigen Fund: Die Leiche eines 14-jährigen Mädchens.
Von einem Unbekannten verfolgt, versuchen sie sich durch den Wald zurück zur Straße zu kämpfen. Die grauenhafte Nacht überstanden, hoffen sie auf Hilfe in einer Blockhütte. Doch dort entdecken sie ein Gruppe verängstigter osteuropäischer Mädchen. Unter Beschuss ihres Verfolgers und dessen Komplizen können Alex und Chris den Mädchen zur Flucht verhelfen. Doch Irina, zu schwach und verletzt, muss von Alex huckepack getragen werden.
Schaffen es Chris und Alex den Fängen der Frauenschleuser zu entkommen und Irina zu retten?

punches of life which all of us have struggles with. 




WE NEED TO RAISE $4,500 TO MAKE THIS PASSION PROJECT POSSIBLE AND WE NEED YOUR HELP!!!

WHY?

ABOUT THE CREATOR OF THE FILM:

Catherine Peters is a senior drama
student at NYU's Tisch School of the Arts. She has studied acting in New Studio on Broadway, Stonestreet Film Acting School, and The Lee Strasberg Theatre & Film Institute. During her time at NYU she has been largely involved in both the theatre and film community doing works such as Melancholy Play, Trojan Women, The Bacchae 2.1, The Hamilton House, and The Bumblebees. She has been trained in stage combat for over 3 years as well as multiple mixed martial arts.



This is the first short film that Catherine has written and she is looking forward to starring as the role of ANDY in ""Barnburner.""

What is a Barnburner?
A barnburner is a very good fight; one that is
very intense and exciting, a real nail-biter. It is a fight that is so close
it's hard to predict who will come out the winner until seconds before it
ends. The film was written with the exact intention that with life we never
know what we are going to get and we must over come the uncertainty and strive
for greatness.



LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION:
Catherine comes from a family of five in small town Jeffersonville,
NY. As a drama/film student she has always wanted to utilize the many beauties
that the Catskills have to offer. She will be shooting her film on Peters Rd. which was named after her family.

<p>The Daily Galaxy (dailygalaxy.com) has operated on a breakeven budget since its launch in 2007 from revenue generated by advertising networks run by AOL, TechMedia, and COX Digital Media that place their ad campaigns on the site and take 50% of revenue earned. </p>
<p>But starting an advertising-free daily Internet radio program is a major commitment that requires serious global support.

<p style=""text-align: left;""><br/></p></div>","Daily Galaxy Radio, which will premiere on June 25, 2015, is an advertising-free global initiative tailored for the mobile era by the creators of dailygalaxy.com, a widely popular news site about the discoveries and events in space, science, and technology that are changing our understanding of our planet and the universe.
Curious about the origins of life? The quantum fabric of spacetime? The odds of life on Jupiter's ""ocean moon,"" Europa? About a solar system with Earth-like planets formed at the dawn of our galaxy? About our human destiny in the cosmos? 
Sign up for our June lift-off today, and join us on our voyages of discovery.


An Immersive Experience
Daily Galaxy Radio will feature the major news and images of the day and easily digestible audio and video interviews in a beautiful graphic environment with the world's leading astronomers, astrobiologists, physicists and cosmologists -- the men and women behind the news who will bring the cosmos to life with stories of their discoveries and insights. 
Our podcasts and ""Starship One"" interactive community forum will function as a think tank devoted to brainstorming the ultimate ""why"" questions, with emphasis on questions of existence, such as the origin of the universe,  the search for life beyond Earth, the nature of time, and the destiny of the human species.


We'll also cover important works of science fiction, both book and film. We're totally in sync with Ridley Scott,  Christopher Nolan (Interstellar) and Kurt Vonnegut in their love of sci-fi authors. 
""You're the only ones zany enough to agonize over time and distance without limit, over mysteries that will never die, over the fact that we are right now determining whether the space voyage for the next billion years or so is going to be Heaven or Hell.""
 – Kurt Vonnegut, God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater


Refreshing Advertising-Free Environment
It's been our experience that advertising has become increasingly more annoying and intrusive, as well as just plain ugly. Especially in audio.
In contrast to ad-supported dailygalaxy.com, Daily Galaxy Radio will be a refreshing advertising-free audio and visual experience, accessible via smartphone, tablet, or desktop, created by Val Landi, one of Silicon Valley's Internet radio pioneers (see ""Our Story"" below).
The Cosmos Live! Daily for $2 a Month
Our radio programming team will reach out for daily interviews with the people --today's explorers of the universe -- making the news and discoveries that are shaping our destiny. People such as:




Dimitar Sasselov (pictured above), Director of the Harvard Origins of Life Initiative and author of The Life Of Super-Earths, who suggests that intelligent life may be in it's ""very young"" stage in the observable Universe.


Paul Davies, physicist and astrobiologist and director of Arizona State University's BEYOND: Center and author of The Eerie Silence: Renewing Our Search for Alien Intelligence, who thinks that advanced civilization may have technologies that have moved beyond matter as we know it. 

UCLA Galactic Center's Andrea Ghez, one of the world's leading experts on our Milky Way Galaxy's supermassive black hole. 


The PERKS: Our ""YOU"" Engine
We suspect you might not need another tee shirt, tote bag, or poster. Our perks are designed to invite YOU to participate in powering Daily Galaxy Radio by contributing compelling content such as our daily Scoop!, Street Views, The SciFi Signal, Today's Big Number. 
Your contributions will be converted to both audio and text and streamed with your byline, posted on our dailygalaxyradio.com home page and global contributors page, which will be tweeted to our highly-engaged Twitter community (338,000) and posted on our Facebook timeline (25,000) to provide the widest audience possible.

The ""Street Views"" are simple smartphone or tablet-created interviews. Think: street reactions to a major discovery or event in science or space. These will be streamed in both audio and/or video formats and posted to our website, Twitter stream, and YouTube channel. An example would be an opening night ""Street View"" of Ridley Scott's The Martian (above), about a manned mission to Mars starring Matt Damon, scheduled for release this November.
We think this is a pretty cool ""WOW"" factor. Use your imagination, have fun, get published, and be recognized for your creativity and talent. All contributors will have a byline credit and a listing on the Daily Galaxy Radio homepage under ""Contributing Editors.""                                                                               Each of our perks is wrapped around a core number of annual subscriptions, one for you, the balance to give out to friends and family as gifts.
All perks selected include a beautiful ""I Helped Bring the Cosmos to Life,"" digital badge (actual size above) for your Facebook page, website,  or Tweets. 
Our Goal:  5,000 ""Lift-off"" Subscribers
Your pre-launch order will help us reach our June Liftoff goal. All Daily Galaxy Radio one-year subscriptions may be renewed in June 2016 at the same Indiegogo pre-launch $24 offer (a 30% discount off our post-launch subscription price). We'll email you your password and simple instructions to access the site on our June launch, along with an ""I Helped Bring the Cosmos to Life"" digital badge for your Facebook and Twitter pages.


When we meet our goal of 5,000 founding subscribers, in addition to our regular daily programming, we'll create a weekend call-in talk show and reach out to several of the most engaging astrobiologists to host weekly ""Insight"" programs focused on the search for life both in and beyond our solar system.  We'll be recruiting the best radio-host talent on the planet for our daily programs from several centers of astronomy, origins of life, astrobiology, astrophysics and cosmology, including MIT, Caltech, Princeton, Stanford, ASU, Colorado, Washington, Arizona, Harvard, Oxford and Australia National University. (Please throw your hat in the ring if this sounds like you!)



The Daily Galaxy (dailygalaxy.com) has operated on a breakeven budget since its launch in 2007 from revenue generated by advertising networks run by AOL, TechMedia, and COX Digital Media that place their ad campaigns on the site and take 50% of revenue earned. 
But starting an advertising-free daily Internet radio program is a major commitment that requires serious global support. Reaching our initial subscriber goal of 5,000 subscribers will underwrite our first year's operating expenses through breakeven, including website and Apple iTunes Store and Google Play app development.

Our ""Galaxy"" DNA 

What makes us unique? In words representative of our Twitter community: it's the ""best of the news about all things cosmos"" and ""awesome graphics.""

The Daily Galaxy In the Press

                  
             Our Story :  ""Something Incredible is Waiting to Be Known""
So whose idea was this anyway? It was Val Landi's, that's me, the founder and publisher of The Daily Galaxy -Great Discoveries Channel, which I launched In 2007, when I moved from San Francisco to Park City, Utah, site of the 2002 Winter Olympics, to live in a beautiful alpine environment,  reduce expenses, and publish dailygalaxy.com.

My experience with Internet radio began when I was recruited in 1998 from Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen's Interval Research venture in Palo Alto to join the startup team at Looksmart.  At Looksmart, an early Google competitor and search directory for Microsoft MSN, I incubated and founded Redband Radio, a Silicon Valley venture-capital and Sony-funded company in partnership with Public Radio International, Expedia, XM Radio, and the Sundance Film Festival. 
Redband was the Web's first major Internet radio site with an amazing all-star team I recruited from NPR, CBS, and CNN, and amazing programs on science and technology, music, film, finance, and travel. Sadly, Sony and our venture-capital investor had us shut Redband down in early 2002 when the U.S. economy went dark, some six months after the tragedy of the World Trade Center attack of 9/11.

<p><span style=""font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px;"">Short Summary</span><br/></p>
</div> <p><i>Driven</i> is the tale of Harry Lennon, son of deceased Formula One champion Jack Lennon, a young man racing in go karts with the aspirations to become world champion in the pinnacle of motorsport, F1. Taking place at the beginning of the intercontinental class championship, young racers are all jostling to be noticed by team talent scouts to be fast-tracked to the top. In a climate where results and stunning lap times can be the winning ticket, Harry is stuck at the back, unable to fund a reliable program and facing accusations of being too old against his junior competition. To complicate matters for Harry's personal success, he has a young family to support and an increasing pressure to drop the dream and settle into his Uncle Frank's mechanic business and make a decent wage. Harry thinks he's found a way to make his last chance count, a risk that for him is worth taking and endangering those around him who don't want to lose another father-figure to the sport. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><i>Driven</i> explores the themes of success versus risk, determination and young fractured families through the exciting backdrop of grass-roots motorsport. The film is a new angle shunning the celebrity culture of the motorsport elite and focusing on a story of a son trying to emulate a father by doing what he loves and disregarding the consequences. As my final year film at Bournemouth University, <i>Driven</i> reflects a combination of passions and an opportunity to channel my learning into an authored entry to the short filmmaking space. I really think this story belongs on the screen and I think it is more than just a film about 'boys and their toys', Harry's actions have consequences for his girlfriend April and his son Sean, a powerful dynamic of the drama we are intending to show. I can't wait to start making this film and I think it will be a highly valuable experience for everybody involved and I'd love to take you to the starting grid with us!<span><br/></span><span><span><br/></span>Any contribution no matter the size is highly valued, myself and the crew will be highly </span>thankful of any generosity towards the project. Please don't feel pressure to donate, but sharing this page and our Facebook page on social media and word of mouth goes a long way, so if you are able to help in that way thank you so much! And if you've read something that's inspired you with ideas and you want to know more, please email me at tomjimp@aol.com, I'd love to know any thoughts you have on how we can make <i>Driven</i> the best that we can. Likewise as this is so motorsport based, please share this with enthusiasts in that area, we want to make a film that represents why I personally love the sport so much and would love to do that for even one other person out there!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The script is currently in development and we will reveal more as updates during the  pre-production, production and post stages. But for now let's have a chat about logistics, where your donations will go and what we need to make this film a great experience for all.</p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>
</p>
<h4><br/></h4>
<p>When making a film, costs are a big consideration for us as
we want to ensure any money received is spent in areas that will contribute the
most to the film in the most successful way. As always, we will be looking to
keep costs down without losing any of the crucial aesthetics of the film. Money
that is raised will be put towards elements of the film that are essential in
any production and will mean the film will be as successful as possible. </p>
<p><u>Locations: </u></p>
<p>Finding the appropriate locations is very important to the
story of this film. As the film is based around go-karting, a race track with
an authentic racing look is going to make a huge difference but will most
likely come at a cost. By contributing to the project you will ensure we are
able to afford the locations along with a small number of others which, as
mentioned, will make a huge difference to the film. </p>
<p><u>Travel:</u></p>
<p>Getting between locations is something that needs to be made
as easy as possible. A multitude of cars will be needed to ferry the crew, cast
and kit between locations and this cost can begin to grow depending on distance
between locations. Whilst we will aim to keep this to a minimum it is an
important consideration and we aim for journeys to be as smooth as possible
which your contributions can help. </p>
<p><u>Catering:</u></p>
<p>Keeping the cast and crew motivated on set can normally be
solved with a hot meal and drink. Some of the money raised will be put towards
catering to ensure everyone is always provided with lunch and dinner as well as
drinks when necessary. </p>
<p><u>Accommodation: </u></p>
<p>At the end of a long shoot day, everyone will need somewhere
comfortable to sleep before the next day. When it is not possible to find
locations nearby to home, suitable accommodation needs to be taken into
consideration. This is something that is of the upmost importance for taking
care of the cast and crew which is, as always, a priority. </p>
<p><u>Costume and Make-Up:</u></p>
<p>As mentioned, keeping the film feeling realistic and
authentic is something that we are keeping as a priority. During the racing
scenes, racing costumes will be essential to keeping to the feel of the film
and whilst we hope that our locations may be able to aid us in terms of props
and costumes, there is always the possibility we will have to fund this
ourselves. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p><u>Camera Hire:</u></p>

We intend to hire a camera with the money raised from this campaign. More news on this will follow, as our DOP is particularly keen to utilise a camera setup which both reflects the high-speed action of the racing sequences and is capable of heightening the family drama aspect of Harry's story. </div><div><span style=""font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px;"">The Crew</span></div><div>
<div>In addition to the bio's seen below, we have a fantastic camera team of second operators and AC's as well as a team of production assistants. They are all specialists in their respective fields and have produced high-quality work in the past. Working alongside them I can testify that our crew will be incredibly hard-working and motivated towards delivering <i>Driven</i> to screen.

<p>Tom has been a fan of motorsport for most of his life, mostly due to having a dad obsessed with all things motoring. An education such as this led to stories of heroic Formula One drivers of the past, flamboyant mavericks and idols who would risk their lives on the track. Tom quickly became fascinated by the drama of motor-racing, ideas such as the underdog success story and the hair-raising comebacks of racers carving their way from the back of the pack to the lead. As Tom became invested in filmmaking, a passion to bring motor-sport to screen became a big part of the development of his final Television Production short film at university.<span><br/></span><br/></p>
<p>Tom has specialised in editing and sound and during his time at university has produced and directed a number of extracurricular projects as well as university films. Tom's work experience has included stints at UK digital production companies as well as incorporating live events work, such as working as a Video Playback operator at the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow for Great Big Events. In the summer of 2014, Tom had an opportunity to realise a dream of sorts and have a week of work experience at a Formula One broadcasting company. This has further confirmed Tom's dedication to making <i>Driven</i> a high-action drama which juxtaposes go-kart racing with a classic pursuit of success narrative. <br/><span><br/></span>Tom is very excited to bring all that he has learnt at university to <i>Driven</i> and to helm a crew of motivated and talented individuals passionate about the project. The film is more than a university film for Tom, as he has ambitions to take the film on a festival run and showcase is abilities to potential employers.

Short Summary
 Driven is the tale of Harry Lennon, son of deceased Formula One champion Jack Lennon, a young man racing in go karts with the aspirations to become world champion in the pinnacle of motorsport, F1. Taking place at the beginning of the intercontinental class championship, young racers are all jostling to be noticed by team talent scouts to be fast-tracked to the top. In a climate where results and stunning lap times can be the winning ticket, Harry is stuck at the back, unable to fund a reliable program and facing accusations of being too old against his junior competition. To complicate matters for Harry's personal success, he has a young family to support and an increasing pressure to drop the dream and settle into his Uncle Frank's mechanic business and make a decent wage. Harry thinks he's found a way to make his last chance count, a risk that for him is worth taking and endangering those around him who don't want to lose another father-figure to the sport. 

Driven explores the themes of success versus risk, determination and young fractured families through the exciting backdrop of grass-roots motorsport. The film is a new angle shunning the celebrity culture of the motorsport elite and focusing on a story of a son trying to emulate a father by doing what he loves and disregarding the consequences. As my final year film at Bournemouth University, Driven reflects a combination of passions and an opportunity to channel my learning into an authored entry to the short filmmaking space. I really think this story belongs on the screen and I think it is more than just a film about 'boys and their toys', Harry's actions have consequences for his girlfriend April and his son Sean, a powerful dynamic of the drama we are intending to show. I can't wait to start making this film and I think it will be a highly valuable experience for everybody involved and I'd love to take you to the starting grid with us!Any contribution no matter the size is highly valued, myself and the crew will be highly thankful of any generosity towards the project. Please don't feel pressure to donate, but sharing this page and our Facebook page on social media and word of mouth goes a long way, so if you are able to help in that way thank you so much! And if you've read something that's inspired you with ideas and you want to know more, please email me at tomjimp@aol.com, I'd love to know any thoughts you have on how we can make Driven the best that we can. Likewise as this is so motorsport based, please share this with enthusiasts in that area, we want to make a film that represents why I personally love the sport so much and would love to do that for even one other person out there!

to catch the attention of Hollywood. Their plan is to put together a pilot
presentation. What is a pilot presentation? A pilot
presentation in essence, is a micro pilot. It provides the audience a glimpse
of the setting, characters and overall plot of the series. Once shot we'll have
a visual to go long with our pitch to networks. The goal is to generate enough buzz from the pilot
presentation to warrant funding for full pilot commitment. 
WHAT IS Gossamer about?Gossamer delves into the ties that bind us to one another, honing in on the negative ramifications of social media on a college campus.                          
Three
friends create a virtual ""little black book"" as a social experiment
for class, however when they decide to take the experiment out of the classroom
the results prove deadly. Their presentation poses the questions: What if we
knew who our peers had been with? What would that reveal about them? How would
that affect our current and future relationships? How much does social media
influence our daily life? And have we taken it too far?”
When
one is found dead of an ""alleged"" suicide, the remaining friends must
ban together to track down who killed them and why. After Benji is found dead of an
""alleged"" suicide, Sasha and Zach must ban together to track down who
killed them.
Sasha
A brilliant and
quick-witted student, who strives to get out of the shadow of her overbearing
mother. Once she's set her mind on something there's no stopping her. She’s
wedged firmly somewhere in between Olivia Pope and Veronica Mars.
Benji
Ambiguously European
model. All eyes are on him when he enters a room. His good looks and charm are
disguises for his secretive and elusive nature.

Zach
On the exterior he's the
average fratty college guy. On the inside, he's struggling to find himself and
impress his suppressive father.

WHY ARE WE DOING INDIEGOGO?
The
purpose of this campaign is to garner the funds necessary to create the high
quality concept envisioned by the producers.If a 100 people donate $80 dollars, we'd reach or goal. 
Funds
raised will go toward equipment rental, permits, insurance,
locations, wardrobe, hair and make up, editing and score. All of
these items can add up, and with help from generous donors and sponsors we can
check them off our lists. Quality is key and the production team want to make
sure they can create the best content possible.


HERE'S WHERE YOU COME IN!

Social media is huge. You
can help us out by spreading the word on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and
by checking out our website.
 You can also
sponsor us, which can take many forms. We need locations, props, catering,
advertising, equipment etc.
 We are also still
looking for more awesome individuals to add to our cast and crew. If you are
interested, email us at gossamertheseries@gmail.com . 
 We are currently in
pre-production and production is scheduled to begin in early spring.",2.0,1,"1 Campaign

What We Need & What You Get

To give this project time to get off the ground, I need to be sure I can cover the costs without charging so much that people can't afford to participate! So this campaign is designed to cover some one-time costs and then the basic first year costs.

 What We Need

From the past two years' experience, I know that I need to have multiple points of entry for this project: text, web, and print. I'll need new software or texting  service to handle more people, my website will need an upgrade to handle fees, and a book version will include several publishing costs, such as an ISBN number!
Then there will be on-going costs for the first year: internet and phone service, plus online payment fees and marketing costs. 






What You Get
Now, the fun part for you.... Well, you get to be part of the first run of The Study! You'll get free time in the project - the more money you donated, the more time you can participate! You can also get a free copy of the book - and if you donate a lot, well, you can get it all with a t-shirt thrown in for good measure!
What I Get
The great part of this campaign is that even if I don't reach the goal, I can still use the funds. The Study will be happening no matter how much the campaign brings in so even less than the full need will help propel the program a little into the future! And, if we should go over the goal.... well, here's the exciting part to me! I want to ultimately have The Study available as an app! I don't see anything like this already available already so I think there's a niche just waiting to be filled! But I also don't see anything out there that I can copy to fit the study's format. So I'm going to need to hire someone to write the app for me... which could be a big investment. 

   
The Impact
I think there can be a strong impact from The Study! People who take the time to look around them and see places where they can matter in the world - put their spirituality into action - well, they can (and do) change the world! We can build a community of people doing that in the same way over a large area - making their faith live in their community and relationships - and we can have an impact! 
Imagine not just reading a bit of scripture but finding a practical way to live it out! Imagine not just talking about some news but taking action in your neighborhood! Imagine not just listening to what someone else is doing but finding ways to join in! 
I've seen this happen in small ways in the project I've been doing for the past two years - people have just amazed me with their creativity and insights! So I know this can happen in The Study as well.

   Risks & Challenges
Now, I know there are challenges here... It's a fairly simple sounding project with a lot of moving parts! But I've been managing most of them for the past two years and I will follow that successful process! And risks: I have already put a lot of time and money into the past version and into The Study without earning a cent from it! I could continue to do that and find I've made a mistake.

<p>The main plot is about Eva
and her passionate relationship with husband, Richard, with a back-story about
her family history and her mother’s experiences in Nigeria during the Biafran
war. As the story unfolds we discover that no one in Eva's life is quite what

reinforces the idea that films are expensive and difficult to create. We're out
to change that fallacious idea with our new feature film: Acceptance. Acceptance
is a story filled with trademarks of love, loss and betrayal. Acceptance exists
at the core of our being. It is our default status. In order to reach this base
level of acceptance, one need only remove the items lying on top. To do this,
we must first identify all the things we do not accept around us. Then, one by
one, eliminate them.</p>
<p>This I did without so much
as a backward glance or afterthought. But the people who hurt me deserved it.
After today, no one will ever hurt or crush my world again.  And I believe the storyline in acceptance
will strike an emotion and strength in everyone who watches it. It is a story
that speaks to mankind’s biggest fears and challenges.</p>
<p>Looking back, I would say I
had always been a fighter. And I think many people are, they just do not
realize it.  This film can help people
connect to their inner fighter.  Never
backing down to anything or anyone, never accepting being second best, and
definitely never ever letting another person bring me down. Help us establish
this film to serve people in need of a new perspective on human growth. As
little as $1 gets your name listed in the credits of the film, your name will
be forever honored as a contributor. Seeing and being part of this film will be
life changing. Empower us to make this vision a reality with a donation to

</div></div></div>","Acceptance: The Feature
Film
With big dreams for a
feature film and a small budget, often times a collaborative effort is
necessary to make the film a reality.  An
environment where everyone pulls together their expertise to make one fully
functioning machine of talent is the best way to make dreams come true on
screen.  It just so happens my film has
all the components to be the perfect place for collaboration.  I have joined together with the greatest film
team and we have an amazing storyline from my book: 'Acceptance'.  Now we need the capital to move forward with
our dream of getting this book on the big screen.  As the creator I am relying on the fans to
make this film possible.                                             Do you ever think about how
a film begins, where the ideas come from?

Do you love films with
bigger meanings, which change the lives of viewers forever?

Are you interested in film
and movies but don’t know how to get involved?
If you answered, “Yes” to
any of these questions, you may want to keep reading…
First
there was The Novel:                           “Acceptance” is a family
drama about love, loss and betrayal and is the first of a
series of novels. The novel shows the tragic consequences of secrets and lies
and what happens when an ordinary girl is let down and is pushed to extremes by
the people she loves – not only by her husband, but her family as well. 
The main plot is about Eva
and her passionate relationship with husband, Richard, with a back-story about
her family history and her mother’s experiences in Nigeria during the Biafran
war. As the story unfolds we discover that no one in Eva's life is quite what
they seem, and Eva gradually uncovers the truth about their deception with
tragic consequences.Now Comes the Film:'Acceptance' is currently
making waves in the UK, USA and other parts of the world.  'Acceptance' will be officially launched in
Lagos & Accra in November 2015. The books shall also be sold and
distributed nationwide and other parts of Africa, particularly West Africa.
The story comes in 3 parts.
The Part 1 is 'Acceptance', Part 2 is 
'Acceptance: Into the Darkness' while the Part 3, the concluding part
shall be released before the end of the year.                                  
 The story is going to adopt into an international standard feature film. International Multi-award winning Script Writer and Director,  Fredi Nwaka AKA Fredi Kruga has converted the story to a screenplay.         Our popular culture
reinforces the idea that films are expensive and difficult to create. We're out
to change that fallacious idea with our new feature film: Acceptance. Acceptance
is a story filled with trademarks of love, loss and betrayal. Acceptance exists
at the core of our being. It is our default status. In order to reach this base
level of acceptance, one need only remove the items lying on top. To do this,
we must first identify all the things we do not accept around us. Then, one by
one, eliminate them.
This I did without so much
as a backward glance or afterthought. But the people who hurt me deserved it.
After today, no one will ever hurt or crush my world again.  And I believe the storyline in acceptance
will strike an emotion and strength in everyone who watches it. It is a story
that speaks to mankind’s biggest fears and challenges.
Looking back, I would say I
had always been a fighter. And I think many people are, they just do not
realize it.  This film can help people
connect to their inner fighter.  Never
backing down to anything or anyone, never accepting being second best, and
definitely never ever letting another person bring me down. Help us establish
this film to serve people in need of a new perspective on human growth. As
little as $1 gets your name listed in the credits of the film, your name will
be forever honored as a contributor. Seeing and being part of this film will be
life changing. Empower us to make this vision a reality with a donation to
this project today!""The story of “Acceptance”
is one that will resonate with most people who are trying to find strength in a
tough place.  The storyline teaches us,
as only a few stories can, about the essential wisdom of pushing through when
times get tough, learning to fight against all odds.“Acceptance” will bring so many positive messages to people:

 Learn about life’s inevitable obstacles


 How to persevere with grit and courage


 Entertain through universal lessons

When
reviewing these benefits and much more, it inspired and assured us that this is
a film that needs to be created. We feel these features will make us incredibly
qualified to succeed.  This paired with
attention to detail and quality filmmaking will send this project to the top of
it's genre. Our mission is to create the best film and viewing experience for
all fans and enthusiast alike!We are passionate with creating a film for humanity, this film is meant to
bring awareness and hope to people going through tough times. Film has been a
tried and true way to bring an issue to the masses.  Films also provide a sense of understanding
that not many other media outlets can do. Our goal is to stay dedicated to our
mission of perseverance and courage because we know our society will benefit
greatly! We have developed a unique script, actors and location that are second
to none. Help us make this film a reality and let’s start spreading the word
today!

<p>(the italicized font between the arrows is your brain. Trust me.)<br/></p>
Oh that minor detail - 
<ul><li>
<b>Tatenda Mbudzi </b>- is the first Zimbabwean to be on stage at the Oscars - and the first of the <b>Academy of Motion Picture Arts &amp; Sciences Oscar Experience </b>winners in the world. <b>Ever</b>.
 You know, that competition where they replace the hot models handing 
out trophies at the Oscars with the most awk-- I mean --most talented students they can find, how
 fitting that his first feature film is about being a social outcast. <br/>
</li></ul>
<p><b>HIS EXPERIENCE</b> <br/></p>
<ul><li>
<b>Tatenda Mbudzi </b>is the  Producer of a feature film with James Franco - <b>Heyday of the Insensitive Basterds</b>, Associate Producer on a documentary about James Franco - <b>Franco, A Documentary</b>.
 Yes; he has spent a lot of time with James Franco. (We all have) --- But that's not all - he is the 2012 winner of a <b>Fred Rogers Memorial Scholarship</b> from the <b>Television Academy and Emmy foundation </b>to develop stories related to childhood development. <b>ZIM HIGH </b>is
 based on one of these two ideas. Twice he has been a semi-finalist for the <b>Sundance International Writers Lab</b>, with the script <b>ZIM HIGH. </b>And now he has decided to make the movie! Also he has worked in script development, marketing and publicity at just about every Hollywood
 studio known to man: <b>Universal Pictures, Xbox 
Studios, 20th Century Fox, Focus Features, Sony Pictures Television</b> etc - and he graduated with an <b>M.F.A. in Film, in the Producing Program </b>from the
 best film school in the world: the <b>UCLA</b> <b>School of Theater, Film &amp; Television.</b>

<i>&lt;-- ""Okay, that makes sense - but why now? And is</i><i>n't making a film really hard?""</i> --&gt;<br/>
</h2>
<p>Why <i><b>NOW </b></i>you ask? Well - because :-<br/></p>
<h3>It's HIGH TIME we had an African Teen Comedy!!<br/>
</h3>
<p>This is not your regular Teen Comedy, bra, owne, exe.... Better get wise to the lingo if you want to survive <b>ZIM HIGH</b>. This is about <b>surviving </b>high school in Zimbabwe, which is like going to Hogwarts, but instead of magic, there is casual racism!</p>
<p>This is about telling a story with a different point of view - yes film is hard, but it is totally worth it - film is a part of our culture - it helps us connect with our humanity; or lack of it! Movies enlighten us and remind us that we are alive <i>and </i>they create work opportunities in every single sector of industry!<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2>
<i>&lt;-- It is high time! What's the story?</i>--&gt;<br/>
</h2>
<b><i>ZIM HIGH</i></b>  <i>is Zimbabwe's premier, most prestigious and violent fictional high school. An institution espousing British Post-Colonial excellence. Beneath it’s proper covering however is a violent Darwinian playpen
of pure juvenile cruelty. </i><span><i><br/><br/>This is a truly Dark teen comedy. Not just because of the complexion
of our characters. No. This is the <b>First African Teen  </b>&amp;<b>Young Adult </b>film of all time. There is no
magical device, and no moral compass to protect
our  “hero” from the harsh reality of
going to high school in Africa, where racial tension and economic instability reign supreme.</i> <br/><br/><i>How does one escape
such an environment unscathed?…Ask <b>TATENDA,</b> our main character a scrawny 17-year-old anime
loving bowl of intelligent fear, who desperately and blindly wants to become –
a <b>PREFECT</b> (an all powerful student leader) to win scholarships to study anime in Japan; but </i></span><i>his chances are dashed when he is framed in an ancient <b>ZIM HIGH </b>bullying tradition - <b>THE GAUNTLET </b> – in which a student almost dies - out of options he is forced to turn to a rebellious Aboriginal Australian new kid for help with his <b>PREFECT </b>campaign. </i><br/><br/><i>This film is about holding onto your dreams, and standing up for yourself before it's too late.</i><br/><h2><br/></h2>
<h2>
<i><b>&lt;&lt;--OOOOH That's very cool! - but why Zimbabwe? Or Africa? </b></i>--&gt;&gt;<br/> </h2>
<ul>
<li>This campaign is to fund the first ever<b> AFRICAN TEEN COMEDY</b> with a<b> real point of view</b> about being a young person with hopes and dreams in Africa - <b>ZIM HIGH</b>. This is a film from a Zimbabwean, African and  BLACK point of view. As you may well know - such things are rare. Africa is usually mentioned as a throwaway in all your favourite films or tv shows;  or it's the backdrop (literally and figuratively) for some white morally absolving adventure. Nothing wrong with white people adventuring -- just that we never see the black side of things. Rarely are there genuine African characters who are more than joke fodder (Token Characters in for example AMERICAN PIE) or target practice (Black Somali's in BLACK HAWK DOWN) - It's <b>HIGH TIME </b>we saw things from an African point of view. This is a film with African kids in it that are not child soldiers (Except when playing video games); and that do not have flies in their mouths. (It happens to everyone at least once) </li>
<li>The African point of view is distinctly black; but this is not a ""<i>fer blacks only</i>"" film (those days are over! Right?) This campaign is about embracing African adolescence in all its colors and confusing wonder - and making fun of it in a way that is enlightening, and not completely offensive. This film has attitude. If you don't identify as African, you should care because -<br/>
</li> <li>There is a severe shortage of black African people on screens. Film language (and European based life languages ""black"" this and ""black"" that) for all of known history tells us that African people are less than; uncivilized; unworthy - we see this from a young age; this affects who we are. This is about changing the perception of the continent; from the inside out - one film at a time, one person at at a time. That person could be you...<br/>

We provide engaging, informative, and meaningful outreach opportunities. Through local outreaches and service learning, our plan is to connect teens with their favorite musical artists by volunteering, service learning, and working together.
Equally, we will take action on outreach issues that are of significance to us and our community. It is our mission to become a driving force in enthusing young people to grow and remain responsibly involved while becoming pillars within their communities.
It's our responsibility!

This will be a fun event.

<br/><h3>Alvaro Conjura aka A.C. (Played by Juan Rosas)</h3>
<p>A struggling author with a failed
book about the incoming Martial Law in America puts on the blue shoes and joins
a gang of likeminded individual’s that treat his book as guidelines for the
incoming Martial Law.  Together they
vowed to protect their city from the corrupt Government Police.  <br/></p>
<p></p>
<br/><h3>Blue Shoes Summary</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>Somewhere in Miami, Florida, conspiracy author <b>Alvaro Conjura </b>receives an opportunity
to sit-down with the owner of a local publishing company, <b>Linda Fulton, </b>to discuss a potential
publishing deal for his failed book “<b>Blue
Shoes.</b>” When it’s Al’s turn to be evaluated, Linda waste no time in
pleasantries and calls the book a poorly written government conspiracy. Al
looks up towards the ceiling in desperation. </p>
<p>Al
stares at the rotating ceiling fan in his room when his cellphone interrupts
his train of thought. Finally, Al’s pent up frustration gets the best of
him, and he throws the phone against the wall. The ringing abruptly stops, but
after a few seconds it starts up again. Al answers the phone “Hey, it’s Wash.
You down to play a quick two on two?” said the voice on the other line – Al’s
high school buddy <b>Felix Washington</b>
or <b>Wash. </b>Al hesitatingly agrees and makes his way to an
empty shoe rack to pick up his old pairs of sneakers.</p>
<p>Stepping up to the three point line in beat up
sneakers – Al shoots but Wash blocks the shot. “Come on, son! You’re not ready
for the zombie apocalypse!” shouts Wash. Meanwhile his team mate <b>Pablo </b>imitates a zombie eating Al’s
teammate <b>Matt</b>. This sparks a heated
debate over government conspiracies. After a back and forth game both teams are
tied, and Al rushes for a game winning lay-up when the soles of his shoe split
and he falls flat on his face. Wash snatches the ball and passes it to Pablo.
He shoots – He scores! Wash and Pablo high five, and then Wash helps Al get
back on his feet and hands him a business card for a shoe store. </p>
<p>Al puts the card away and enters the shoe store. A
voice comes from the back and says “Take a seat.” He sits on a bench when an
odd young man comes out holding a box of shoes. Al’s offended by his frankness,
but before he can leave the odd man quotes a line from his book. It turns out
this man is known as <b>ShoeMaker</b> and
he wants Al to join his band of freedom fighters that follow his book as a
guidelines to combat the government. After much convincing Al grabs a blue shoe
– the symbol of joining the cause and he slips it right in. </p>
<p>One year later – Al ties his blue shoes while News
clips of the financial collapse, martial law and riots play on the television.
A gunshot breaks the silence. Al grabs his gun and heads outside. He shoots.
Takes cover, and finally jumps the fence to escape the gunfire. </p>
<p>Al runs into an alley with a dead end, but by the
time he turns back there’s a menacing gang walking his way. Al aims his gun,
but there’s too many of them. Lucky for him the gang ends up being the blue
shoes army. The Shoemaker welcomes Al to the group, and reintroduces him to his
friend Wash - also a member. When suddenly a flash of blue and red, light up
the alley – it’s the militarized police. The Blue Shoes Army attacks with all
their might in order to defend their city from Martial Law.<span>  </span></p>

The Shoemaker (Played by Jean Carlo Taveras)
Owner of a men's shoe store –
the shoemaker prepares a group of men to survive the government collapse and
incoming martial law with teachings from book titled Blue Shoes by A.C. They learned
to fire guns, prepared emergency food supplies, and most importantly save citizens
from the long arm of the law. 
Alvaro Conjura aka A.C. (Played by Juan Rosas)
A struggling author with a failed
book about the incoming Martial Law in America puts on the blue shoes and joins
a gang of likeminded individual’s that treat his book as guidelines for the
incoming Martial Law.  Together they
vowed to protect their city from the corrupt Government Police.  

Blue Shoes Summary


Somewhere in Miami, Florida, conspiracy author Alvaro Conjura receives an opportunity
to sit-down with the owner of a local publishing company, Linda Fulton, to discuss a potential
publishing deal for his failed book “Blue
Shoes.” When it’s Al’s turn to be evaluated, Linda waste no time in
pleasantries and calls the book a poorly written government conspiracy. Al
looks up towards the ceiling in desperation. 
Al
stares at the rotating ceiling fan in his room when his cellphone interrupts
his train of thought. Finally, Al’s pent up frustration gets the best of
him, and he throws the phone against the wall. The ringing abruptly stops, but
after a few seconds it starts up again. Al answers the phone “Hey, it’s Wash.
You down to play a quick two on two?” said the voice on the other line – Al’s
high school buddy Felix Washington
or Wash. Al hesitatingly agrees and makes his way to an
empty shoe rack to pick up his old pairs of sneakers.
Stepping up to the three point line in beat up
sneakers – Al shoots but Wash blocks the shot. “Come on, son! You’re not ready
for the zombie apocalypse!” shouts Wash. Meanwhile his team mate Pablo imitates a zombie eating Al’s
teammate Matt. This sparks a heated
debate over government conspiracies. After a back and forth game both teams are
tied, and Al rushes for a game winning lay-up when the soles of his shoe split
and he falls flat on his face. Wash snatches the ball and passes it to Pablo.
He shoots – He scores! Wash and Pablo high five, and then Wash helps Al get
back on his feet and hands him a business card for a shoe store. 
Al puts the card away and enters the shoe store. A
voice comes from the back and says “Take a seat.” He sits on a bench when an
odd young man comes out holding a box of shoes. Al’s offended by his frankness,
but before he can leave the odd man quotes a line from his book. It turns out
this man is known as ShoeMaker and
he wants Al to join his band of freedom fighters that follow his book as a
guidelines to combat the government. After much convincing Al grabs a blue shoe
– the symbol of joining the cause and he slips it right in. 
One year later – Al ties his blue shoes while News
clips of the financial collapse, martial law and riots play on the television.
A gunshot breaks the silence. Al grabs his gun and heads outside. He shoots.
Takes cover, and finally jumps the fence to escape the gunfire. 
Al runs into an alley with a dead end, but by the
time he turns back there’s a menacing gang walking his way. Al aims his gun,
but there’s too many of them. Lucky for him the gang ends up being the blue
shoes army. The Shoemaker welcomes Al to the group, and reintroduces him to his
friend Wash - also a member. When suddenly a flash of blue and red, light up
the alley – it’s the militarized police. The Blue Shoes Army attacks with all
their might in order to defend their city from Martial Law.

a loved one suffer through dementia.  My
grandmother slowly declined and eventually succumbed to the disease over the
course of several years. And for anyone who has known someone with
dementia or Alzheimer's, it is a frustrating and helpless ordeal... watching
someone so full of life fade into unresponsive silence.  And while
dementia affects so many people (around 36 million globally) and research
continues to look at treatments and preventative measures, there is no cure.<br/><br/><p>So to that end, in honor of my grandmother and all of those
who suffer from the disease, we are making this film to continue the discussion
and raise attention and awareness for this condition which affects so many.  It is a story about love, meant to share a positive feeling with those who have suffered alongside their loved ones.<br/></p>
<br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1221991/files/20150214155612-banner-1b.JPG?1423958172"" src="""" style=""""/><div>
<br/>My name is
<a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4565321/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jeffrey Kraynak</a> and I am a writer in New York City.  I've been writing for some time now, having
penned ten features and seven shorts. 
One of my shorts, <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2215555/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Strive</a>, won the Corporate Production competition for
the Richmond International Film Festival and was subsequently produced and
screened there.  A separate short won
Best Screenplay at Richmond
as well.  Several of my features have
been accepted as official selections in numerous festivals internationally.  While screenwriting is my focus, I have also published a
book of poetry (<a href=""http://animalcrackersbook.wix.com/animal-crackers"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Animal Crackers</a>) with my brother, who illustrated it.<br/><br/><p>Our main intention here is to just tell a great, heart-warming
story.  And that's exactly what this is...
though it's a little hard to explain without giving too much away.  As with much of my writing, things aren't
always what they appear to be.  So let's
talk inspiration.</p>
<br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1172954/files/20150125105610-The_Origami_Gate.jpg?1422212170"" src="""" style=""width: 421.503px; height: 506px;""/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Unfortunately, as I said before, my grandmother had dementia and my family and
I had to watch her slowly decline over a span of several years.  And so I wondered how much of that silence was merely on the
surface.  How many thoughts wanted to be
expressed?  How many words ached for a
voice to share them?  How much of a
refuge did memories provide?  What if
there was so much more going on behind those silent eyes?</p>
So I wrote this piece about how love can bridge the most
distant gaps.  As a writer and filmmaker, this is my way of sharing my own thoughts and experiences.  And hopefully, in doing so, it gives others with similar family experience something to connect with.<br/><br/><p></p>

<br/>While this is a very personal passion project of mine, I can't do it alone.  In order to do this story justice, the only way is to do it right, and not cut any corners.  And that requires paying for the best.  While certain elements of this film I could probably do or get for free, I also believe in paying people for their work.  Here's a breakdown of our costs:<br/><br/><ul>

continues to look at treatments and preventative measures, there is no cure.So to that end, in honor of my grandmother and all of those
who suffer from the disease, we are making this film to continue the discussion
and raise attention and awareness for this condition which affects so many.  It is a story about love, meant to share a positive feeling with those who have suffered alongside their loved ones.

My name is
Jeffrey Kraynak and I am a writer in New York City.  I've been writing for some time now, having
penned ten features and seven shorts. 
One of my shorts, Strive, won the Corporate Production competition for
the Richmond International Film Festival and was subsequently produced and
screened there.  A separate short won
Best Screenplay at Richmond
as well.  Several of my features have
been accepted as official selections in numerous festivals internationally.  While screenwriting is my focus, I have also published a
book of poetry (Animal Crackers) with my brother, who illustrated it.Our main intention here is to just tell a great, heart-warming
story.  And that's exactly what this is...
though it's a little hard to explain without giving too much away.  As with much of my writing, things aren't
always what they appear to be.  So let's
talk inspiration.


Unfortunately, as I said before, my grandmother had dementia and my family and
I had to watch her slowly decline over a span of several years.  And so I wondered how much of that silence was merely on the
surface.  How many thoughts wanted to be
expressed?  How many words ached for a
voice to share them?  How much of a
refuge did memories provide?  What if
there was so much more going on behind those silent eyes?
So I wrote this piece about how love can bridge the most
distant gaps.  As a writer and filmmaker, this is my way of sharing my own thoughts and experiences.  And hopefully, in doing so, it gives others with similar family experience something to connect with.

While this is a very personal passion project of mine, I can't do it alone.  In order to do this story justice, the only way is to do it right, and not cut any corners.  And that requires paying for the best.  While certain elements of this film I could probably do or get for free, I also believe in paying people for their work.  Here's a breakdown of our costs:

Location- We will be filming for two days at the gorgeous Bartow-Pell Mansion Museum in Pelham Bay, NY. It's one of our bigger expenses and necessary in order to give The Origami Gate its required elegance. $2000


Cast- We are working with an incredible group of SAG and Non-Union talent. These amazing professionals work from the heart and were naturally drawn to the story. $1900


Crew- These highly skilled technicians are also artists. The Rock Stars of a film set. $2850


Equipment- James is shooting on a Canon C300 with a super sweet kit. And Brandon doesn't work well without lights and stuff. $1200                 


Post Production- We are hiring a Wizard... No, really, some very 
talented folks are making this film look and sound as beautiful as possible... I think they're wizards. $1200


Film Festival Submissions- Our intention is for The Origami gate to be widely viewed; to showcase our team of artists while at the same time raising awareness for Alzheimer's research and support groups. $400                                 


Food- 14 people for two days and we all get very cranky without something to eat. $400


Insurance- Safety first, insurance second. $400


Transportation- Car and gas. $300


INDIEGOGO (4%)- Gladly given! $400


Credit Card fees (3%)- Their fair and proper. $300

We are a start-up Entertainment Company self-financing this production.  Your generous contributions will help bring this heartfelt story to life and get it out there to touch as many people as possible.

<p>Carrot Rocker is a short
film that chronicles the story of an old ex-bassist named Robbie.  The film opens with Robbie planting carrots
in his yard, which has become a favorite activity for the former rocker.  Unexpectedly, Robbie receives a letter
inviting him to an audition, though his band has been disbanded for many
years.  The surprise invitation helps
Robbie to realize that he wants to relive his time as a rocker, and to get back
on stage where he belongs. His wife, Jan, thinks that Robbie is too old to
chase old rock dreams and wants him to move on with his life.  Despite Jan’s reservations about the time commitment
and his ability to get back his old prowess as a bassist, Robbie knows he has
to make a decision. </p>
<p>This short film was
written by Hal Quincy (who, coincidently, used to be a rocker), and was
co-written by Bryan Stubbles.  My name is <b>David Yap</b> and I’m the Director for this
exciting project.  I had been searching
for a story that could address the question ""Can one get too old for their
passion?""  After reading Carrot
Rocker, I immediately fell in love with the story and simply had to be involved.

<p>We felt that it was essential to tell this story through a short

grasping your enthusiasm, despite negativity or opposition. </p>

What is IMDB credit?

IMDB is a platform where all the information
of motion picture is kept. IMDB stands for International Movie Database. Once
you select a perk, let say an EXECUTIVE PRODUCER. Your name will be under the
movie section ""EXECUTIVE PRODUCER."" 
You’ll instantly get your own IMDB account, and will be visible to
everyone from film fans to major motion picture directors.
