<p>Swiss White
Teeth  is one of the most advanced teeth whitening lamp in the world. It's
new, it's innovative, and <b>unlike many whitening systems similar to ours, it's
time effective and cost effective to the consumer</b>. It's controlled by a microcomputer, and can accurately and efficiently activate whitening gel to provide deep
whitening.  Its purpose is to accelerate the whitening gel properties for teeth whitening.</p>
<p><span>Whitening remains one of the single most economical
ways to enhance your smile. As Americans, we can’t get enough of it, spending
$1.4 billion annually on all sorts of tooth whitening products, including gels,
toothpastes, mouthwash, strips, and more. Statistics show that tooth whitening
procedures have increased an incredible 300 percent in recent years!</span></p>
<p>While many of the products listed above will do some degree of lightening on the average consumer's teeth, the results are usually less than the desired look and the consumer may spend a great deal more money trying to “level up” on the whiteness of their teeth through other, more costly, measures. </p>
<p>One of the most time and cost-effective methods is through the use of an accelerator, with which the dentist or consumer can speed up the whitening process after a cream or gel has been applied to “bleach” the teeth back closer to their original luster. </p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1308758/files/20150319130407-Julien-1.jpg?1426795447"" src="""" style=""""/><br/>
<br/><p><b>Our whitening system contains the most advanced teeth whitening light with 2.4 inch TFT color screen and USB interface. Utilizing similar technology to those in dental offices,</b> but at a fraction of the cost, our advanced teeth whitening system consists of a floor-standing or table top teeth whitening light that includes the
ability to use either six blue lights or four blue and two red lights depending
on user preference. The machine is light weight, easy to operate and transport
from room to room or office to office when used in a professional capacity.</p>
<p>The whitening system cycle is performed in 20 minutes, including 5 min before treatment and 5 min after treatment for client treatment preparation. Our unique automatic timer ensures that the client is under the unit for only as long as the treatment is active, and the unit will stop automatically at the end of the session. </p>
<p>We guarantee results between 8-11 shades of whiteness after 1 single session, with a possibility of an even whiter smile if a second treatment is applied. <b>Our product is completely safe, without any risk to either tooth enamel or gum.</b></p>
<p>Our recommended list price for 1 session for commercial users is $400-$700, with a huge profitability margin.</p>

It is quick and easy for all parties involved.</span><br/></p>
</div>

<div>
<p>Teeth
whitening is one of the simplest cosmetic procedures if done right. Doing it
right means using a proper whitening agent and an appropriate whitening
accelerator. The most practical accelerator is an LED lamp emitting cold blue
light with a wavelength of around 465 nanometers. This wavelength of light is
ideal for activating the special gel and accelerating the whitening
process.</p>
<p>Whitening is not a
permanent solution, as the stains will come back. If you smoke or consume a lot of
staining foods or drinks, you may see the whiteness start to fade in as little
as one month. For the average user of a teeth whitening system, it can become
costly to make repeat visits to the dentist to have the whitening process
redone. Some users may find the desired level of whiteness reached after a
single session; however, most will find themselves back in the office another
two or three times before the desired level is reached. This is why it is key
to provide a less expensive option for our customers. They can use the machine
to whiten and brighten their teeth from the privacy and comfort of their own
homes, which is a luxury in of itself. </p>
<p>While <b>the strength
of our advanced whitening system is comparable to those available in
professional offices</b>, we want to make it the cost effective for the everyday
buyer. In order to do this, we are seeking funding to help us get going with marketing this product.</p>

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1299406/files/20150316112300-FAQ.png?1426530180"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><b>What causes teeth to stain?</b></p>
<p>A: There are many things that can cause your teeth to stain. As we age, our teeth become less bright. Additionally, smoking, certain medications and drinking wine, coffee, tea and soda can all contribute to a dull smile.</p>
<p><b>Does teeth whitening damage the tooth enamel?</b></p>
<p>A: Absolutely not, The methods of teeth whitening we use do not damage or corrode the tooth enamel. It's totaly safe.</p>
<div>
<p><b>What is the timeline ?</b></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1301658/files/20150317042733-timeline.png?1426591653"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<div>
<b>Are my teeth going to be sensitive after each whitening session? If so, how long should I expect for the sensitive to go away?</b><p></p>
<p>No, except if you do too many sessions in a short time. One teeth whitening session will be enough for a while.</p>
<p><b>Do I need the whitening kit, the $10 perk, to use the machine? If so, does the machine come with a whitening kit, or do I have to buy both perks?</b></p>
<p>You just need to share our campaign, we can track it and we will give the Whitening Kit for free. Yes you need it.</p>
<p><b>If I need the whitening kit to operate the machine, where can I buy it once I run out of the one I receive?</b><br/></p>
<p>We will open an online store when the campaign will be finished. Concerning the Whitening kit it will be available at the same price but the Swiss White Teeth will be sold 680$<br/></p>
<p><b>Could you explain in layman’s terms how your whitening treatment works?</b><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>How Swiss White Teeth works is by emitting high intensity light packed with diodes that contain bleaching properties such as peroxide and of course our special teeth gel that makes the whitening effect much stronger than any other teeth whitening method.<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span></p>
<p><b>What is your breakthrough? How can you lower the price so much?</b><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>Instead of complicating the machine's body, we gave more importance to  the machine's head and also to our unique gel. It's our specific gel and the ""Swiss White Teeth""  technology together that make the price cheaper.</p>
<p>Our retail price extra-indiegogo will be 680$ for both model. </p>

We will also offer up to 5 free Swiss White teeth (model 1) to people who have shared our campaign or contributed without perk.










Swiss White
Teeth  is one of the most advanced teeth whitening lamp in the world. It's
new, it's innovative, and unlike many whitening systems similar to ours, it's
time effective and cost effective to the consumer. It's controlled by a microcomputer, and can accurately and efficiently activate whitening gel to provide deep
whitening.  Its purpose is to accelerate the whitening gel properties for teeth whitening.
Whitening remains one of the single most economical
ways to enhance your smile. As Americans, we can’t get enough of it, spending
$1.4 billion annually on all sorts of tooth whitening products, including gels,
toothpastes, mouthwash, strips, and more. Statistics show that tooth whitening
procedures have increased an incredible 300 percent in recent years!
While many of the products listed above will do some degree of lightening on the average consumer's teeth, the results are usually less than the desired look and the consumer may spend a great deal more money trying to “level up” on the whiteness of their teeth through other, more costly, measures. 
One of the most time and cost-effective methods is through the use of an accelerator, with which the dentist or consumer can speed up the whitening process after a cream or gel has been applied to “bleach” the teeth back closer to their original luster. 

Our whitening system contains the most advanced teeth whitening light with 2.4 inch TFT color screen and USB interface. Utilizing similar technology to those in dental offices, but at a fraction of the cost, our advanced teeth whitening system consists of a floor-standing or table top teeth whitening light that includes the
ability to use either six blue lights or four blue and two red lights depending
on user preference. The machine is light weight, easy to operate and transport
from room to room or office to office when used in a professional capacity.
The whitening system cycle is performed in 20 minutes, including 5 min before treatment and 5 min after treatment for client treatment preparation. Our unique automatic timer ensures that the client is under the unit for only as long as the treatment is active, and the unit will stop automatically at the end of the session. 
We guarantee results between 8-11 shades of whiteness after 1 single session, with a possibility of an even whiter smile if a second treatment is applied. Our product is completely safe, without any risk to either tooth enamel or gum.
Our recommended list price for 1 session for commercial users is $400-$700, with a huge profitability margin.












Exogenous stains caused by smoke, tea, cola, coffee, etc.


Endogenous stains caused by tetracycline pigmentation tooth


Dental fluorosis, plaque teeth, or other unknown reasons








Model 2





With this light source with specific diodes emitting high intensity light, the special gel bleaching properties gel accelerated.
In fact, the light accelerates the properties of substances contained in the bleaching agent. These substances penetrate the enamel and attack stains and discoloration making them whiter and brighter teeth. The duration of treatment is shown on the screen with a countdown and the unit will automatically stop when the time is over.
- 2 Pairs of safety goggles included.

We have designed, built, and tested the Swiss White Teeth prototype and software. We have selected a well-respected production facility that we have previously worked with successfully. 
However, one of our biggest concerns was making Swiss White Teeth affordable to the largest amount of people possible, while still insisting on a rich feature set. In order to proceed, we need create the tooling and order quantity necessary to keep the price reasonable for everyone. 
That is why you are our most important asset! By working together, we can all benefit. 

By donating to our crowd fund project, you are guaranteeing that customers looking for a safe, cost-effective teeth whitening system will be able to find one in their price range and ability level. As we are not relying on our own incomes to get this product line started, we can make sure that the price is considerably lower to purchase the product on the consumer side further down the line. 







By investing in our project, your pre-orders will help fund the first production run in a quantity that keeps the price low for everyone. In return you get (besides our gratitude and sincere thanks!) a totally new kind of teeth whitening machine at a highly discounted price.
More than that, you join Swiss White Teeth and make a statement about the importance of health, technology, and style. 
We have created several different perks to offer Swiss White Teeth at prices up to 60% off of retail, as well as some special perks.











We have developed a rigorous testing and quality control process to insure your Swiss White Teeth machine will arrive in perfect working order. The packaging is designed and we have a partner to produce it. We have investigated and secured the logistics partners needed for safe delivery worldwide. 
A NOTE TO INTERNATIONAL BACKERS:
Please note:  Backers will be responsible for any and all customs, import duties, ,local taxes or any legal issue you may incur in your country of residence.  We recommend you ask your local tax authorities what you will incur based on the value of your pledge.  Please understand that we have no control over what your own country will charge you in VAT and import duties.  Shipping cost are included. As a final note, we cannot misrepresent the customs information.  We appreciate your understanding of this matter.











Until a couple of years ago, only dentists could perform teeth whitening treatments. Now, with the technology available and innovative self-administered packaging, we can offer you, for hundreds less, similar or better results! It is quick and easy for all parties involved.



Teeth
whitening is one of the simplest cosmetic procedures if done right. Doing it
right means using a proper whitening agent and an appropriate whitening
accelerator. The most practical accelerator is an LED lamp emitting cold blue
light with a wavelength of around 465 nanometers. This wavelength of light is
ideal for activating the special gel and accelerating the whitening
process.
Whitening is not a
permanent solution, as the stains will come back. If you smoke or consume a lot of
staining foods or drinks, you may see the whiteness start to fade in as little
as one month. For the average user of a teeth whitening system, it can become
costly to make repeat visits to the dentist to have the whitening process
redone. Some users may find the desired level of whiteness reached after a
single session; however, most will find themselves back in the office another
two or three times before the desired level is reached. This is why it is key
to provide a less expensive option for our customers. They can use the machine
to whiten and brighten their teeth from the privacy and comfort of their own
homes, which is a luxury in of itself. 
While the strength
of our advanced whitening system is comparable to those available in
professional offices, we want to make it the cost effective for the everyday
buyer. In order to do this, we are seeking funding to help us get going with marketing this product.




What causes teeth to stain?
A: There are many things that can cause your teeth to stain. As we age, our teeth become less bright. Additionally, smoking, certain medications and drinking wine, coffee, tea and soda can all contribute to a dull smile.
Does teeth whitening damage the tooth enamel?
A: Absolutely not, The methods of teeth whitening we use do not damage or corrode the tooth enamel. It's totaly safe.

What is the timeline ?






Are my teeth going to be sensitive after each whitening session? If so, how long should I expect for the sensitive to go away?
No, except if you do too many sessions in a short time. One teeth whitening session will be enough for a while.
Do I need the whitening kit, the $10 perk, to use the machine? If so, does the machine come with a whitening kit, or do I have to buy both perks?
You just need to share our campaign, we can track it and we will give the Whitening Kit for free. Yes you need it.
If I need the whitening kit to operate the machine, where can I buy it once I run out of the one I receive?
We will open an online store when the campaign will be finished. Concerning the Whitening kit it will be available at the same price but the Swiss White Teeth will be sold 680$
Could you explain in layman’s terms how your whitening treatment works?

How Swiss White Teeth works is by emitting high intensity light packed with diodes that contain bleaching properties such as peroxide and of course our special teeth gel that makes the whitening effect much stronger than any other teeth whitening method.
What is your breakthrough? How can you lower the price so much?

Instead of complicating the machine's body, we gave more importance to  the machine's head and also to our unique gel. It's our specific gel and the ""Swiss White Teeth""  technology together that make the price cheaper.
Our retail price extra-indiegogo will be 680$ for both model. 
Also, we spend more time on developing a new way of using Led diodes so they can give maximum efficiency.
How much time should I wait between sessions?
Our bleaching process should last from 6 months to a year. In general, people like to do it again after 3-6 month, depending of your habit (smoke, red wine, coffee, etc.).
Why does the machine need support if it’s light weight?
During the session, you must not move and have to wait during the bleaching process.

In the question about how the treatment works in layman’s terms, could you also explain how the “six blue light or four blue light and two red light” are used?


The blue light (light frequency) activate the whitening gel and accelerate the whitening process
The red light protect from mouth stomatitics.


According to your sensitivity you can choose between six blue light or four blue light and two red light. Hope it's clear.


Would you consider having one or two new perks for combos of whitening kits? For example, 5 kits, and 10 kits.



Great idea, you can now find those perks with discount prices.



Couldn’t you post a video of someone using the machine? The video would have two purposes: (1) showing how practical it is to use the machine, and (2) demonstrating the final result.




We will do it, we understand it's an important point but we need time to do it, we are actually working hard on this campaign. In all cases, be sure you will have this video before the campaign end.
Could you add some pictures of before and after using the machine?
Idem.



I should use one whitening kit per person per session, shouldn’t I?



It's correct. One whitening kit per person and per session.


How long should I wait between the first and the second treatment if I’m not satisfied with the result of the first treatment? Do I need two whitening kits to do both treatments in this case?

You will be satisfied, if not, we advice you to repeat the process after some month.

His parents who are visiting the UK are not covered by the NHS and the doctors have have asked for a down payment of £30,000 before treatment can start. We are spreading the word to all branches of our church to help raise funds for this boy.

If we do not hit the target, treatment cannot start........and the poor boy will die. At such a young age, no one should have to go through this. All money raised will be given <b><i>directly</i></b> to this boy's parents. The total cost for treatment is £80,000 but i have asked for £30,000 because that is what the doctors are requesting for. So if we manage to achieve and surpass this target, it will all go towards the treatment of this boy. Please contribute, or help spread the word so that everyone can get involved. Imagine if this boy was your son, and you were counting on others to help you.........let this passion burn within you and let's help save a life.

If we do not hit the target, treatment cannot start........and the poor boy will die. At such a young age, no one should have to go through this. All money raised will be given directly to this boy's parents. The total cost for treatment is £80,000 but i have asked for £30,000 because that is what the doctors are requesting for. So if we manage to achieve and surpass this target, it will all go towards the treatment of this boy. Please contribute, or help spread the word so that everyone can get involved. Imagine if this boy was your son, and you were counting on others to help you.........let this passion burn within you and let's help save a life. I have set a maximum deadline of 30 days so hopefully we should be able to make a difference.Life is precious....especially when it is so young and innocent.Let's help make this happen.You can also contact me on 00447970563507 in case you want to know more about this campaign.Thank you.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

In case of emergency, Birdi flashes its lights, sounds the alarm and sends alerts directly to the phones of anyone who needs to know.

Do you know the quality of the air that you’re breathing? Bad air quality is a leading cause of cancer worldwide, and yet we have no way of tracking and improving it. Birdi is here to let us all breathe a little easier. We monitor the emissions, particles, and pollen that might be bothering you. This is crucial for those of us with respiratory issues like asthma, but also for kids and the elderly who are majorly impacted by pollution, humidity and other air quality issues as they sleep and throughout the day. Join us and let’s get better together. </span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em; color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-weight: normal;""><br/></span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em; color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-weight: normal;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/247688/files/20131207110620-Birdi-Features.png?1386443180"" src="""" style=""""/> Birdi's elegant design is meant to be a beautiful addition to your ceiling.

<p style=""font-weight: bold;""></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>1a:
Is Birdi really safe?</b></p>
<p>We can and will only ship once we adhere to the
proper certification standards (UL 217, UL 2034, CE). But these are the bare
minimum. We’re going above and beyond to make sure that Birdi is even better
than what’s out there. While many alarms only alert once detecting dangerous
levels, we show you prolonged exposure to fumes over time and alert you when
that becomes just as dangerous. </p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>1b:
How many Birdi devices do I need in my home?</b></p>
<p>The national fire alarm code states that
you need one in your bedrooms, hallway, kitchen, living room and basement. Birdi is wirelessly interconnected (a multiple station device) so if there’s an
emergency in the kitchen, the siren in the bedroom will sound too. </p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/250218/files/20131209005828-fire_code.png?1386579508"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""></p>
<p>Note: You can have up to 5 Birdi devices
in one location that connect through the free app on your phone. If you subscribe to the service plan you can have an unlimited amount. </p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>1c:
Can I buy Birdi for my office or my second home? Or to help me watch over my
child, elderly parent or pet?</b></p>
<p>Of course! And the more you buy, the
cheaper they become. Remember: we’re here to make life better and want to help
you as much as we can. You can access them all from the same free app or even
from a landline, in case grandma doesn’t have an iPhone. Unfortunately, Fido
can’t get alerts on his collar just yet, but that's why we're opening up our API to the community.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>1d:
Does this replace my existing smoke and/or carbon monoxide alarms?</b></p>
<p>If your battery-operated smoke alarm is
working, then you’re in the minority. Most disasters happen not because people
don’t have alarms, but because the ones they have don’t have working
batteries. Birdi can add protection if you already have some working ones, or
it can work as a totally stand-alone system.</p>
<p>One of the benefits of replacing the
current system is that all the Birdi’s are wirelessly interconnected together in a flock (multiple station). So if
one goes off, they all do, and you’re alerted about the location of the danger
through the app. </p>
<p>Plus, with Birdi you decide whether it’s
an emergency or false alarm right from your phone so that you don’t have to
deal with confusing security systems or third-party notifiers. It could even
save you money because those false alarms usually come with fines of $100 and
up from the fire department. Each false alarm that we prevent covers the cost
of another Birdi, saving you money!</p>
<p>Please note that this device is not officially a smoke and/or CO alarm until it receives certification from the appropriate body, which will happen before it becomes available.  </p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>1e:
Can I choose the color that best matches my walls?</b></p>
<p>You spend a lot of time and money
decorating your house. We want to help you by blending in. Not only is our design simple and clean, we also come in a number of colors so that it can blend even further. It's our stretch goal to have multiple colors. If we reach $100,000, we'll introduce colors. The first batch is meant to be a beautiful addition to a
newborn’s room or to a colorful living room. If you want a certain color, we
may include it in the next batch. Just let us know! </p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>1f:
Can anyone setup a Birdi?</b></p>
<p>Yes. Simplicity is core for us. Birdi was
designed to streamline setup. The app syncs your wifi settings with your
device by singing a custom bird song. It’s our new BirdiSync technology and we
think it’s pretty cool. Just take Birdi out of the box, BirdiSync your settings,
and place it on the wall. Our universal mount makes ceiling installation easy too. It’s that simple.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>1g:
Can I get my neighbor a Birdi?</b></p>
<p>Neighborhoods are physically connected
and now they’re digitally connected. If your neighbor has a fire, it’ll alert
you too (if they've opted in). It’s safer than finding
out by hearing the fire trucks roll up. At that point,
it might be too late. </p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>1h: Is it available in
my country and/or language?</b></p>
<p>Birdi is international. We’re available for worldwide
shipping. This is tricky, so there’s an additional charge for supporters
outside of the USA (sorry!). </p>
<p>We speak a bunch of languages (and growing!). Currently we
communicate in: Arabic (<span>العربية), Chinese (中文简体), English, French
(Français), Russian (Русский), Spanish (Español), Afrikaans‎, Pirate (Yarrrrr). If you want to translate Birdi into another language,
we’ll add it to our app and credit you on our site as an awesome person: </span><a href=""https://www.transifex.com/organization/birdi"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.transifex.com/organization/birdi</a></p>
<p>The certifications we’re obtaining reach far and wide, but
please be aware that if they don’t comply with your local safety regulations,
you should not use this product as a safety device. </p>
<p>Be aware of any additional costs you may be responsible
for, such as import fees or VAT. We’re working on setting this up so that you
don’t have to worry about it, but aren’t there yet. </p>

<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>2a:
What are the shipping costs?</b></p>
<p>Free shipping in the USA. While we are committed to being international, global shipping is more difficult for us at his stage and so has an additional cost.
Please be aware that we do not include extra fees from customs or any other
additional costs associated with countries outside the USA. While we're
confident that we will function well around the world, there is no guarantee
that this will work in your country due to climate &amp; connectivity issues.
Of course, if we find out that shipping isn't possible, or if we find out any
other issues regarding your country your perk will be reimbursed.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>2b:
When is the soonest I can get a Birdi connected in my home?</b></p>
<p>Incubating a hardware is similar in ways to incubating a child. Working with our manufacturers to take this to full
term, we've collectively planned shipping to start 9 months after our campaign ends and after we
know the scale of our first run. We're doing all that we can to ship the perks that we promised and estimate shipping to begin in October 2014. This is after we've also completed the time-consuming process of receiving the necessary safety certifications to deliver you the safest possible product. We promise that our campaign supporters will be the very first to have them once they ship. If you're planning to
have a child, now is the perfect time to reserve yours! </p>

<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>3a:
Will Birdi work with Android, Blackberry, Shnosberry, etc? </b></p>
<p>We are designing Birdi so that it will
work with any web-enabled device, with extra features to enhance the experience
in our native app. Prior to launch, we are developing for iOS and Android. </p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>3b:
Can I use multiple phones with my Birdi?</b></p>
<p>Yes. The app is free and one Birdi device
can connect to several smartphones and landlines. Whether they're family or friends, little Birdi tells everyone.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>3c:
How is Birdi powered? What happens if the power or WiFi goes out?</b></p>
<p>The first version of Birdi runs on batteries and
communicates over wifi. If the batteries are running low, we'll send you an
alert way in advance and send you a new battery way before the old one runs
out. We're happy to do anything we can to make you breathe a little easier.
Since we operate over wifi, if it does happen to go out, the device becomes a
regular smoke and carbon monoxide alarm, sounding the siren if it senses
danger. In the worst case scenario, Birdi will still be a smoke and carbon monoxide alarm. We'll also let you know if the wifi has gone down for any significant
amount of time. Down the road, we may even help you send a frustrated letter to
your service provider, because we know that not having wifi is no joke.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>3d:
What voltage does Birdi Support?</b></p>
<p>Birdi comes with standard AA batteries.
You can find them just about anywhere in the world. This is part of our plan to always be as accessible as possible. </p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>3e:
How long do the batteries last?</b></p>
<p>Our AA batteries last for about 2 years.
We’ll warn you when they’re getting low and send you a new set if you’re
subscribed to our service. </p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>3f:
How long does the carbon monoxide (CO) sensor last?</b></p>
<p>We can guarantee a 7-year lifespan due to
existing government regulations. But our device learns over time and will
update the settings as it calibrates to your home over the years. Our Carbon Monoxide sensor is pre-certified with UL2034, and we’re doing everything we can to make sure it can keep on protecting you as long as possible beyond those 7 years without needing replacement.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>3g:
Can Birdi detect other emergencies like tornados, earthquakes or alien
invasions?</b></p>
<p>Yes. We'll be introducing geo-fenced alerts for emergencies. There was a time when a local
emergency would cause the civil defense siren to sound and we'd turn on our
radios to wait for instructions. This system doesn't work well for a lot of
people anymore. We seek to augment the existing systems by sounding the alarm
in your home too, so that you have added protection when you're home. If
there's a sudden local emergency like a tornado, flood, or otherwise, our
device will sound the alarm. If there's an alien invasion, well, we all have
bigger problems. But we will find a way to let you know, and get to work on creating a new translation set. This feature will be in the experimental phase and only
available in certain areas until we can roll it out fully.</p>

Can I mount Birdi on a wall or ceiling?</b></p>
<p>Birdi was designed to seamlessly blend in
with the ceiling. It can also work on a wall in certain situations where it can
still detect smoke, as in accordance with fire codes.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>3i:
Do multiple Birdi devices communicate with each other? </b></p>
<p>Birdi
devices are wirelessly interconnected and function as a multiple station smoke

Does Birdi work with my existing smoke and carbon monoxide alarms?</b></p>
<p>Birdi is a multiple
station smoke alarm so that when it goes off in the kitchen, it also goes off
in the bedroom. However, it only works that way with other Birdi devices. Other
companies have proprietary systems that we can’t communicate with. Similarly,
some devices have a wired interconnect between devices.</p>

What are the health impacts of PM 2.5?</b></p>
<p>The air we’re breathing is causing
cancer. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), a part of the
World Health Organization (WHO), has now classed air pollution in the same
category as tobacco smoke, UV radiation and plutonium. PM 2.5 relates to fine
particles, which contain large amounts of toxic and hazardous substances that
stick in your lungs. Causes include cooking emissions, oil soot, and industrial
processes, as well as second-hand smoke.

<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>4b:
How do you detect smoke?</b></p>
<p>We use a photoelectric sensor, which uses a beam of light to detect smoke. These alarm types are most effective for typical residential fires, that originate from a smoldering source, which can also fill a home with dangerous gases even before the fire ever erupts.</p>
<p>Older smoke detectors used ionization sensors, which use radioactive material to detect small particles entering the chamber. These ionization sensors were originally designed to detect heat, not smoke, and so do not respond fast or at all to slow smoldering, smoky fires which are the most common types of residential fires. These were typically used due to their significantly lower cost. Common belief is that one of these ionization sensors is necessary for flaming fires, but research done by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has shown that during a flame ignition fire, the photoelectric smoke detector has only a 3.99% probability of a failure to detect the fire whereas the ionization detector probability of failure is as high as 19.8%. Besides that, ionization sensors have been the largest cause of nuisance alarms (in one case, 97% of devices tested for nuisance alarms were ionization-type). This frustration encourages homeowners to remove or disable their smoke alarms. Given the significant amount of research testifying to their poor performance and unreliable nature, we believed that the future of smoke detection should not rely on using cheap sensors that use radioactive material. <a href=""http://fire.nist.gov"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://fire.nist.gov</a><br/></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>4c:
Wait, the smoke alarm on my ceiling has radioactive materials?</b></p>
<p>About 90% of existing smoke alarms do. They use
ionization to react to fires. These ionization chamber smoke detectors contain
radioactive material. The radiation source is a small disc, about 3 to 5
millimeters in diameter, weighing about 0.5 gram and made of americium-241 in a
gold matrix. Because they are inexpensive, ionization detectors are more
common. We decided
that radiation wasn’t a good idea for our device.

<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>4d:
What about cigarette smoke?</b></p>
<p>You’re covered. If you have a strict no
smoking policy, you can enforce it. We can even track the amount of smoking
that’s happening.  </p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>4e: Why should I be more concerned about carbon monoxide (CO)?</b></p>
<p>Carbon monoxide poisoning is a very serious threat and we strive to do everything we can to prevent this silent killer.<br/><br/>It is an extremely deadly, colorless and odorless gas, not to be confused with carbon dioxide (CO2). In small amounts, it replaces the oxygen in your bloodstream, causing suffocation usually without any obviously apparent symptoms. It is released in varying amounts by most combustion sources, such as boilers, stoves, car exhausts, smoking, space heaters and even the pilot flames in your gas stove. Symptoms of poisoning include dull headaches, weakness and dizziness, which are not good enough indicators on their own to let us know that something is dangerously wrong. <br/><br/>Other carbon monoxide sensors are only supposed to alert you when threateningly high levels are sustained. These detectors give you no idea of your exposure until it is an emergency and it starts beeping. At that point, carbon monoxide poisoning may have already caused confusion and delirium, leaving you in a state where you can't act on the alarm effectively.<br/><br/>These devices are not meant to alarm for at least 30 days at 30ppm, which is enough exposure to cause headaches and dizziness within 6 hours. At 70+ppm, the alarm only has to start in 60-240 minutes.<br/><br/>With the Birdi app you will be able to track your CO in your home with about 2ppm accuracy. You'll be able to spot a leak long before it gets to a dangerous level, so that you can act on it and get the help that you need. You'll get a detailed message from Birdi explaining exactly what to do and if it's an emergency, we'll alert the right people as quickly as possible.<br/></p>

What can I do if the air is bad?</b></p>
<p>We give you tips that you can use. If the
air is bad, we’ll send you warnings. You can set your level of sensitivity to
be less or more informed. If the air is better outside than inside, we may tell
you to open a window. If not, we’ll tell you that’s not a great idea. And we’ll
help direct you to air purifiers, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and plants that
can help improve the conditions inside your home. Our marketplace will use the

you can make informed purchases based on real results. </p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>4g:
How does air impact my sleep?</b></p>
<p>Bad air means bad sleep. It can reduce
the quality of sleep but more dangerously, air pollution increases the risk of
sleep-disordered breathing, a group of disorders including sleep apnea, in
which breathing stops briefly during sleep. Up to 17% of U.S. adults have
sleep-disordered breathing, according to Antonella Zanobetti, PhD, a senior
research scientist at the Harvard School of Public Health. </p>
<p><a href=""http://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/news/20100617/air-pollution-linked-to-sleep-breathing-problems"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/news/20100617/air-pollution-linked-to-sleep-breathing-problems</a>. If humidity is too
low, skin gets dry and chapped and it can exacerbate psoriasis and quickly
lead to respiratory disease. If humidity is too high mold can proliferate in your home.<b> </b></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>4h:
How does air impact my child’s sleep?</b></p>
<p>Air dangers are especially acute with
children and the elderly. Babies have sensitive skin and even more sensitive
respiratory systems. During the winter-time, when central heaters are turned on
and indoor humidity drops to 10 percent or less, the dry air can irritate a
baby’s skin, nose, and lungs. This cold, dry air also helps viruses to grow.
Furthermore, when babies come down with a cold or respiratory infection, they
cannot take the same over-the-counter drugs that an older child or an adult
can; their small bodies are too fragile for strong medicines. For all of these
reasons, pediatricians frequently recommend humidifiers for babies, especially
in dry climates.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>4i: How does monitoring for carbon dioxide (CO2) help me?</b></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""></p>
<p>Carbon dioxide (not to be confused by carbon monoxide, the extremely deadly gas that we also monitor for) is produced by almost all living things, especially us.</p>
<p>Long exposure to small amounts can affect your concentration, energy levels and can cause headaches. But besides that, a buildup of CO2 indoors means that you have not gotten fresh air in your house for a while, which is an indicator of other harmful effects, such as the buildup of fumes slowly given off by your furniture, paint and other household compounds, or just an indicator that it’s time to open some windows. In that case, we will be able to let you know.</p>
<p>Larger levels of carbon dioxide can buildup in areas that store carbonated beverages, or when there is some form of combustion occuring. Levels of around 3% will cause you to start breathing at twice your normal rate, and cause dizziness, increased heart rate and blood pressure, while above 10% can cause suffocation. But Birdi will warn you and the people that need to know long before that happens.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>4j:
Do you monitor for mold?</b></p>
<p>By
tracing particulates in the air and following humidity levels, we’re able to
help warn that mold might be growing. Edward Olmsted, an industrial hygienist
in Garrison, N.Y., puts it best: ""Mold is like a factory that produces
billions of spores,"" he said. ""The factory runs only when moisture is
available. Eliminate the moisture, and you shut down the factory."" While
we can’t yet monitor for mold itself, we can warn you about moisture levels. </p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>4k:
Do you monitor for radon or gas?</b></p>
<p>No. Exposure
to radon in the home is responsible for an estimated 20,000 lung cancer deaths

gas that poses a serious health hazard. We don’t detect for that or gas leaks, but you should.

<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>6a:
Can it monitor Carbon Monoxide if its mounted on the ceiling? </b></p>
<p>Yes. According to the CO guidelines of the National Fire Protection Association, carbon monoxide alarms should “be centrally located outside of each separate sleeping area in the immediate vicinity of the bedrooms,” and each alarm should “be located on the wall, ceiling or other location” according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.</p>
<p>There’s a common myth that carbon
monoxide (CO) sensors are supposed to be placed at “knee height” because CO is
heavier than air. CO is actually slightly lighter than air and diffuses evenly
through rooms. Besides, the source of carbon monoxide is usually warm, like a boiler. In this case the carbon monoxide containing air will be more likely to rise to higher areas of your home. Typical sensors are often plugged into wall outlets as a convenient power
source, placing them close to the floor in rooms. </p>
<p>Besides, we give you pre-warnings that
show you visualizations of carbon monoxide levels, even if they’re not yet an emergency.</p>

What are the challenges?</b></p>
<p>Smoke alarms tend to be annoying. And air quality devices are confusing and expensive. While the sensors exist and are reliable, combining the functionality
is truly unique and there's nothing else out there which comes even close. We're working with the top manufacturing experts to bring this device into
every home with realistic and achievable deadlines and promise to be open and
transparent about any delays that come up which are beyond our control.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>7b:
Where are you crafting this product?</b></p>
<p>Birdi is designed in Brooklyn, developed
in San Francisco, and manufactured in Shenzhen. Deciding where to produce
products is never easy these days. For Birdi, we started at the Cleanweb
Hackathon in NYC and worked on our industrial design and graphic design from
there. Then we joined Highway1 in San Francisco and started building the next
iterations of the technology, beyond our initial prototype. For manufacturing,
we needed to go to China, the sensor capital of the world, since our product is
packed full of them. Throughout, we want to make sure that our production
process is transparent and sustainable. If you’d like, you can even see who
we’re working with and learn about the conditions there. It’s important to us
that everyone who touches Birdi is positively affected and that includes the
workers who build our product to the customers who enjoy it.</p>

<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>7c:
How environmentally friendly are you?</b></p>
<p>It’s important to us that making Birdi
doesn’t have a negative impact on air quality. We’re making Birdi as green as
possible from the packaging to the casing to the factories that they’re built
in. While every other smoke detector and air quality monitor is made from oil,
ours is actually made from pollution. That’s right, we’re removing pollution
from the air to make our case. It’s recaptured CO2, and we hope to set a
precedent for other companies to follow suit. Our production line has a team of
specialists to constantly monitor it to find ways to improve environmental
sustainability. Worker health as social sustainability is important to us too.
So much that Birdi is available in some of the factories so that we can monitor
the air there and work to improve it. And of course, our packaging is 100%
recycled and recyclable. Once the sensors are no longer active, around 7-10
years depending on our testing, we’ll help guide you to local recycling facilities to
reduce the environmental impact at the product’s end of life. </p>

early in our development and mentioned that he lives with two deaf people. He
requested that we build Birdi with accessibility in mind and we responded. In addition to the visual alerts that people receive on their phones in case
they can’t hear the alarm, we also have a color-coded system (green for good,
red for trouble), that flash from the device. Since nearly 10% of the country

Better than a smoke detector. Birdi tracks air quality, whether it's an everyday health danger like pollution or an emergency like fire and carbon monoxide, to keep your family healthy and safe.  We keep you connected
and protected through our device and app. Birdi is packed with sensors to alert you about the quality of the air in your home and neighborhood, giving you tips on how to keep the air you breathe fresh and healthy. In case of emergency, Birdi flashes its lights, sounds the alarm and sends alerts directly to the phones of anyone who needs to know. To ease your mind, you can control it right from both your smartphone and landline. Plus, we’ll never bother you while you’re cooking or trying to get to sleep, unless the emergency is real.
Do you know the quality of the air that you’re breathing? Bad air quality is a leading cause of cancer worldwide, and yet we have no way of tracking and improving it. Birdi is here to let us all breathe a little easier. We monitor the emissions, particles, and pollen that might be bothering you. This is crucial for those of us with respiratory issues like asthma, but also for kids and the elderly who are majorly impacted by pollution, humidity and other air quality issues as they sleep and throughout the day. Join us and let’s get better together.  Birdi's elegant design is meant to be a beautiful addition to your ceiling. It’s the perfect fit to replace your existing smoke alarm with one that easily matches the décor of your baby’s room, bedroom, and kitchen. It's wifi connected, easy to set up, and it’s packed with features to keep you healthy and safe:
 Gizmodo – “Every Smart Appliance Should Be As Brilliant As
This Smoke Alarm”
Fast Company – “A Smarter Smoke Detector That Tracks The
Horrible Air You're Breathing”
AllThingsD – “Perhaps most conveniently, the smoke and CO
monitor can be turned off via the smartphone app, as well — so, no more
insistent chirping while you stand on a chair trying to quiet your smoke alarm.”
  
Replace your typical
smoke alarm with a Birdi that not only looks beautiful on your wall and ceiling but also connects you to
the information you need to know. Whether it's the air quality you're breathing or
alerts about a fire or exposure to dangerous fumes like carbon monoxide, Birdi tells you the information you need, exactly when you need
it. 

Have you ever
gotten up in the middle of the night because your smoke detector was chirping
about the battery? Birdi is smarter than that. We send you alerts right
when you need them. Is the air thick with pollen or pollution? Is there a fire
at home? Is someone smoking? Everyone who needs to know will find out right
when it matters most. And if the battery is low, we’ll send you a new one a few
months in advance, never reminding you at 2am. 
Quiet Birdi from your phone before it interrupts your cooking. Before we signal the siren, everyone in the house is alerted to decide whether it’s an
emergency, false alarm or still uncertain. Whether you're in
the kitchen or on vacation, we'll call the authorities. You'll always know that your pets and home are safe. Birdi learns over
time so that you’re only alerted when you need to be.
Indoor air quality is 2-8x worse than outdoor.
What's the pollution like in your home right now? Most of us have no idea. Yet
we’re seeing asthma rates continue to rise and bad air is now determined to be a
leading cause of cancer. Birdi is the only device that both tracks emergencies and gives you tips about how to improve the air for your family
and friends. We’re opening that data to developers and scientists with an API so
that the brightest people from around the world can help us all take action and
improve the air all around us.
If your neighbor’s house is in trouble, you
probably need to know. Birdi lets everyone on the block know if there’s an emergency.
Have an Airbnb guest? It’s probably best that they’re kept in the loop. Let’s
not forget about grandma either. It’ll call her on her landline, and send you a
notification that something is wrong. And if there’s a natural disaster on its
way like a tornado, flood, or earthquake, your Birdi will signal you.
It’s not just about fire anymore.
Birdi can tell you if stale air, dryness and temperature
changes are impacting your sleep. Even better, we can help prevent respiratory
tract infection, ease cold symptoms and reduce dry skin or itchy eyes by
advising on raising the level of indoor humidity. And at a lower cost than devices
that only monitor air quality. Plus, you know we'll never disturb you with a
low-battery chirp at in the middle of the night.   






















The Birdi app will always be free. You can connect all of your friends and family in your app so that the right people know if there’s a problem, exactly when they need to. (Even without a wifi internet connection or the advanced features in our service plan, our device is always a beautiful and reliable air monitor and smoke alarm). Our optional and contract-free
service plan adds 3 advanced features for a low monthly cost of $9.99, and there is a three month free trial for all our Indiegogo backers. Remember, even without an internet connection or these advanced features, our device is always a beautiful and reliable smoke alarm:







No matter your location or language, we want to make sure that you're part of our flock, and that you're always connected. Beyond the free app service, we can also enable calling you over a landline in 208 countries around the world. You'll also have SMS backup in case there’s no
data service on the phone to connect to the app.  






We want to deliver you peace of mind. We will mail batteries to
you in advance if yours are running low. But only if you want them. 





We are there even when you’re not. If you’re stuck in a cell phone dead zone or away on vacation, we'll call 911 so you don't have to. This ensures Birdi is your 24/7 connected safety backup and delivers all the information to authorities as soon as it’s needed. 





















The fire
death rate in the US hasn’t changed in 40 years because so many people have
removed the batteries from their existing smoke alarms. We can do better.

Our co-founder Mark had the idea for a smart carbon monoxide detector after Hurricane Sandy. His grandmother lives in what was the evacuation zone. When disaster struck, she was left heating her home with her gas stove for weeks, spewing dangerous amounts of carbon monoxide. His goal became to create something that would call her landline phone and walk her through the problem in her native Russian and also send him a push notification to give a heads up that his grandma was in trouble. Looking at existing products, he saw an opportunity to create something that didn't exist. 





Instead of simply building a better carbon monoxide detector or smoke alarm, we redesigned the device from the ground up. Existing products already sense what’s in the air, they just don't go far enough. Why not monitor for both emergency and her overall health every day? Thus, Birdi was hatched.

TRANSLATIONS




1a:
Is Birdi really safe?
We can and will only ship once we adhere to the
proper certification standards (UL 217, UL 2034, CE). But these are the bare
minimum. We’re going above and beyond to make sure that Birdi is even better
than what’s out there. While many alarms only alert once detecting dangerous
levels, we show you prolonged exposure to fumes over time and alert you when
that becomes just as dangerous. 
1b:
How many Birdi devices do I need in my home?
The national fire alarm code states that
you need one in your bedrooms, hallway, kitchen, living room and basement. Birdi is wirelessly interconnected (a multiple station device) so if there’s an
emergency in the kitchen, the siren in the bedroom will sound too. 



Note: You can have up to 5 Birdi devices
in one location that connect through the free app on your phone. If you subscribe to the service plan you can have an unlimited amount. 
1c:
Can I buy Birdi for my office or my second home? Or to help me watch over my
child, elderly parent or pet?
Of course! And the more you buy, the
cheaper they become. Remember: we’re here to make life better and want to help
you as much as we can. You can access them all from the same free app or even
from a landline, in case grandma doesn’t have an iPhone. Unfortunately, Fido
can’t get alerts on his collar just yet, but that's why we're opening up our API to the community.
1d:
Does this replace my existing smoke and/or carbon monoxide alarms?
If your battery-operated smoke alarm is
working, then you’re in the minority. Most disasters happen not because people
don’t have alarms, but because the ones they have don’t have working
batteries. Birdi can add protection if you already have some working ones, or
it can work as a totally stand-alone system.
One of the benefits of replacing the
current system is that all the Birdi’s are wirelessly interconnected together in a flock (multiple station). So if
one goes off, they all do, and you’re alerted about the location of the danger
through the app. 
Plus, with Birdi you decide whether it’s
an emergency or false alarm right from your phone so that you don’t have to
deal with confusing security systems or third-party notifiers. It could even
save you money because those false alarms usually come with fines of $100 and
up from the fire department. Each false alarm that we prevent covers the cost
of another Birdi, saving you money!
Please note that this device is not officially a smoke and/or CO alarm until it receives certification from the appropriate body, which will happen before it becomes available.  
1e:
Can I choose the color that best matches my walls?
You spend a lot of time and money
decorating your house. We want to help you by blending in. Not only is our design simple and clean, we also come in a number of colors so that it can blend even further. It's our stretch goal to have multiple colors. If we reach $100,000, we'll introduce colors. The first batch is meant to be a beautiful addition to a
newborn’s room or to a colorful living room. If you want a certain color, we
may include it in the next batch. Just let us know! 
1f:
Can anyone setup a Birdi?
Yes. Simplicity is core for us. Birdi was
designed to streamline setup. The app syncs your wifi settings with your
device by singing a custom bird song. It’s our new BirdiSync technology and we
think it’s pretty cool. Just take Birdi out of the box, BirdiSync your settings,
and place it on the wall. Our universal mount makes ceiling installation easy too. It’s that simple.
1g:
Can I get my neighbor a Birdi?
Neighborhoods are physically connected
and now they’re digitally connected. If your neighbor has a fire, it’ll alert
you too (if they've opted in). It’s safer than finding
out by hearing the fire trucks roll up. At that point,
it might be too late. 
1h: Is it available in
my country and/or language?
Birdi is international. We’re available for worldwide
shipping. This is tricky, so there’s an additional charge for supporters
outside of the USA (sorry!). 
We speak a bunch of languages (and growing!). Currently we
communicate in: Arabic (العربية), Chinese (中文简体), English, French
(Français), Russian (Русский), Spanish (Español), Afrikaans‎, Pirate (Yarrrrr). If you want to translate Birdi into another language,
we’ll add it to our app and credit you on our site as an awesome person: https://www.transifex.com/organization/birdi
The certifications we’re obtaining reach far and wide, but
please be aware that if they don’t comply with your local safety regulations,
you should not use this product as a safety device. 
Be aware of any additional costs you may be responsible
for, such as import fees or VAT. We’re working on setting this up so that you
don’t have to worry about it, but aren’t there yet. 




Up to FAQ
2a:
What are the shipping costs?
Free shipping in the USA. While we are committed to being international, global shipping is more difficult for us at his stage and so has an additional cost.
Please be aware that we do not include extra fees from customs or any other
additional costs associated with countries outside the USA. While we're
confident that we will function well around the world, there is no guarantee
that this will work in your country due to climate & connectivity issues.
Of course, if we find out that shipping isn't possible, or if we find out any
other issues regarding your country your perk will be reimbursed.
2b:
When is the soonest I can get a Birdi connected in my home?
Incubating a hardware is similar in ways to incubating a child. Working with our manufacturers to take this to full
term, we've collectively planned shipping to start 9 months after our campaign ends and after we
know the scale of our first run. We're doing all that we can to ship the perks that we promised and estimate shipping to begin in October 2014. This is after we've also completed the time-consuming process of receiving the necessary safety certifications to deliver you the safest possible product. We promise that our campaign supporters will be the very first to have them once they ship. If you're planning to
have a child, now is the perfect time to reserve yours! 




Up to FAQ
3a:
Will Birdi work with Android, Blackberry, Shnosberry, etc? 
We are designing Birdi so that it will
work with any web-enabled device, with extra features to enhance the experience
in our native app. Prior to launch, we are developing for iOS and Android. 
3b:
Can I use multiple phones with my Birdi?
Yes. The app is free and one Birdi device
can connect to several smartphones and landlines. Whether they're family or friends, little Birdi tells everyone.
3c:
How is Birdi powered? What happens if the power or WiFi goes out?
The first version of Birdi runs on batteries and
communicates over wifi. If the batteries are running low, we'll send you an
alert way in advance and send you a new battery way before the old one runs
out. We're happy to do anything we can to make you breathe a little easier.
Since we operate over wifi, if it does happen to go out, the device becomes a
regular smoke and carbon monoxide alarm, sounding the siren if it senses
danger. In the worst case scenario, Birdi will still be a smoke and carbon monoxide alarm. We'll also let you know if the wifi has gone down for any significant
amount of time. Down the road, we may even help you send a frustrated letter to
your service provider, because we know that not having wifi is no joke.
3d:
What voltage does Birdi Support?
Birdi comes with standard AA batteries.
You can find them just about anywhere in the world. This is part of our plan to always be as accessible as possible. 
3e:
How long do the batteries last?
Our AA batteries last for about 2 years.
We’ll warn you when they’re getting low and send you a new set if you’re
subscribed to our service. 
3f:
How long does the carbon monoxide (CO) sensor last?
We can guarantee a 7-year lifespan due to
existing government regulations. But our device learns over time and will
update the settings as it calibrates to your home over the years. Our Carbon Monoxide sensor is pre-certified with UL2034, and we’re doing everything we can to make sure it can keep on protecting you as long as possible beyond those 7 years without needing replacement.
3g:
Can Birdi detect other emergencies like tornados, earthquakes or alien
invasions?
Yes. We'll be introducing geo-fenced alerts for emergencies. There was a time when a local
emergency would cause the civil defense siren to sound and we'd turn on our
radios to wait for instructions. This system doesn't work well for a lot of
people anymore. We seek to augment the existing systems by sounding the alarm
in your home too, so that you have added protection when you're home. If
there's a sudden local emergency like a tornado, flood, or otherwise, our
device will sound the alarm. If there's an alien invasion, well, we all have
bigger problems. But we will find a way to let you know, and get to work on creating a new translation set. This feature will be in the experimental phase and only
available in certain areas until we can roll it out fully.
3h:
Can I mount Birdi on a wall or ceiling?
Birdi was designed to seamlessly blend in
with the ceiling. It can also work on a wall in certain situations where it can
still detect smoke, as in accordance with fire codes.
3i:
Do multiple Birdi devices communicate with each other? 
Birdi
devices are wirelessly interconnected and function as a multiple station smoke
alarm. If it goes off in the kid’s room, it also goes off in the kitchen. This
generally works they’re 50ft (15m) apart or closer. Some features may reduce
their range, like the type of building material, ductwork, or other large
metallic objects.
3j:
Does Birdi work with my existing smoke and carbon monoxide alarms?
Birdi is a multiple
station smoke alarm so that when it goes off in the kitchen, it also goes off
in the bedroom. However, it only works that way with other Birdi devices. Other
companies have proprietary systems that we can’t communicate with. Similarly,
some devices have a wired interconnect between devices.







Up to FAQ
4a:
What are the health impacts of PM 2.5?
The air we’re breathing is causing
cancer. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), a part of the
World Health Organization (WHO), has now classed air pollution in the same
category as tobacco smoke, UV radiation and plutonium. PM 2.5 relates to fine
particles, which contain large amounts of toxic and hazardous substances that
stick in your lungs. Causes include cooking emissions, oil soot, and industrial
processes, as well as second-hand smoke. 
http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24564446
4b:
How do you detect smoke?
We use a photoelectric sensor, which uses a beam of light to detect smoke. These alarm types are most effective for typical residential fires, that originate from a smoldering source, which can also fill a home with dangerous gases even before the fire ever erupts.
Older smoke detectors used ionization sensors, which use radioactive material to detect small particles entering the chamber. These ionization sensors were originally designed to detect heat, not smoke, and so do not respond fast or at all to slow smoldering, smoky fires which are the most common types of residential fires. These were typically used due to their significantly lower cost. Common belief is that one of these ionization sensors is necessary for flaming fires, but research done by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has shown that during a flame ignition fire, the photoelectric smoke detector has only a 3.99% probability of a failure to detect the fire whereas the ionization detector probability of failure is as high as 19.8%. Besides that, ionization sensors have been the largest cause of nuisance alarms (in one case, 97% of devices tested for nuisance alarms were ionization-type). This frustration encourages homeowners to remove or disable their smoke alarms. Given the significant amount of research testifying to their poor performance and unreliable nature, we believed that the future of smoke detection should not rely on using cheap sensors that use radioactive material. http://fire.nist.gov
4c:
Wait, the smoke alarm on my ceiling has radioactive materials?
About 90% of existing smoke alarms do. They use
ionization to react to fires. These ionization chamber smoke detectors contain
radioactive material. The radiation source is a small disc, about 3 to 5
millimeters in diameter, weighing about 0.5 gram and made of americium-241 in a
gold matrix. Because they are inexpensive, ionization detectors are more
common. We decided
that radiation wasn’t a good idea for our device. You can learn more about the different types of smoke alarms here - http://www.ul.com/global/eng/pages/corporate/newsroom/storyideas/smokealarms  
4d:
What about cigarette smoke?
You’re covered. If you have a strict no
smoking policy, you can enforce it. We can even track the amount of smoking
that’s happening.  
4e: Why should I be more concerned about carbon monoxide (CO)?
Carbon monoxide poisoning is a very serious threat and we strive to do everything we can to prevent this silent killer.It is an extremely deadly, colorless and odorless gas, not to be confused with carbon dioxide (CO2). In small amounts, it replaces the oxygen in your bloodstream, causing suffocation usually without any obviously apparent symptoms. It is released in varying amounts by most combustion sources, such as boilers, stoves, car exhausts, smoking, space heaters and even the pilot flames in your gas stove. Symptoms of poisoning include dull headaches, weakness and dizziness, which are not good enough indicators on their own to let us know that something is dangerously wrong. Other carbon monoxide sensors are only supposed to alert you when threateningly high levels are sustained. These detectors give you no idea of your exposure until it is an emergency and it starts beeping. At that point, carbon monoxide poisoning may have already caused confusion and delirium, leaving you in a state where you can't act on the alarm effectively.These devices are not meant to alarm for at least 30 days at 30ppm, which is enough exposure to cause headaches and dizziness within 6 hours. At 70+ppm, the alarm only has to start in 60-240 minutes.With the Birdi app you will be able to track your CO in your home with about 2ppm accuracy. You'll be able to spot a leak long before it gets to a dangerous level, so that you can act on it and get the help that you need. You'll get a detailed message from Birdi explaining exactly what to do and if it's an emergency, we'll alert the right people as quickly as possible.
4f:
What can I do if the air is bad?
We give you tips that you can use. If the
air is bad, we’ll send you warnings. You can set your level of sensitivity to
be less or more informed. If the air is better outside than inside, we may tell
you to open a window. If not, we’ll tell you that’s not a great idea. And we’ll
help direct you to air purifiers, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and plants that
can help improve the conditions inside your home. Our marketplace will use the
data from our devices to tell you which purifiers are working the best, so that
you can make informed purchases based on real results. 
4g:
How does air impact my sleep?
Bad air means bad sleep. It can reduce
the quality of sleep but more dangerously, air pollution increases the risk of
sleep-disordered breathing, a group of disorders including sleep apnea, in
which breathing stops briefly during sleep. Up to 17% of U.S. adults have
sleep-disordered breathing, according to Antonella Zanobetti, PhD, a senior
research scientist at the Harvard School of Public Health. 
http://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/news/20100617/air-pollution-linked-to-sleep-breathing-problems. If humidity is too
low, skin gets dry and chapped and it can exacerbate psoriasis and quickly
lead to respiratory disease. If humidity is too high mold can proliferate in your home. 
4h:
How does air impact my child’s sleep?
Air dangers are especially acute with
children and the elderly. Babies have sensitive skin and even more sensitive
respiratory systems. During the winter-time, when central heaters are turned on
and indoor humidity drops to 10 percent or less, the dry air can irritate a
baby’s skin, nose, and lungs. This cold, dry air also helps viruses to grow.
Furthermore, when babies come down with a cold or respiratory infection, they
cannot take the same over-the-counter drugs that an older child or an adult
can; their small bodies are too fragile for strong medicines. For all of these
reasons, pediatricians frequently recommend humidifiers for babies, especially
in dry climates.
4i: How does monitoring for carbon dioxide (CO2) help me?

Carbon dioxide (not to be confused by carbon monoxide, the extremely deadly gas that we also monitor for) is produced by almost all living things, especially us.
Long exposure to small amounts can affect your concentration, energy levels and can cause headaches. But besides that, a buildup of CO2 indoors means that you have not gotten fresh air in your house for a while, which is an indicator of other harmful effects, such as the buildup of fumes slowly given off by your furniture, paint and other household compounds, or just an indicator that it’s time to open some windows. In that case, we will be able to let you know.
Larger levels of carbon dioxide can buildup in areas that store carbonated beverages, or when there is some form of combustion occuring. Levels of around 3% will cause you to start breathing at twice your normal rate, and cause dizziness, increased heart rate and blood pressure, while above 10% can cause suffocation. But Birdi will warn you and the people that need to know long before that happens.

4j:
Do you monitor for mold?
By
tracing particulates in the air and following humidity levels, we’re able to
help warn that mold might be growing. Edward Olmsted, an industrial hygienist
in Garrison, N.Y., puts it best: ""Mold is like a factory that produces
billions of spores,"" he said. ""The factory runs only when moisture is
available. Eliminate the moisture, and you shut down the factory."" While
we can’t yet monitor for mold itself, we can warn you about moisture levels. 
4k:
Do you monitor for radon or gas?
No. Exposure
to radon in the home is responsible for an estimated 20,000 lung cancer deaths
each year in the USA. That’s more than drunk driving. Radon is a radioactive
gas that poses a serious health hazard. We don’t detect for that or gas leaks, but you should.
Learn more about how to do that here - http://www.epa.gov/radon/pubs/citguide.html
4l:
Do you help prevent sick building syndrome?
Yes.
The following causes have been cited as contributing factors, according to the
EPA: inadequate ventilation, chemical contaminants such as volatile organic
compounds (VOCs), stale air, biological contaminants and more. We both monitor
and give tips on how to improve air-flow based on the air both indoors and
outside. 



Up to FAQ

5a:
How secure is it?
Our security is as strong as a bank, if
not stronger. All communication between your Birdi, the cloud and the app is
encrypted over SSL (HTTPS). 

5a: How private is my information?

All of your information is private and visible only to you and people in your inner circle who you specifically invite to see it. Any data available through the API is abstracted so that an individual's information is never visible. 

5c: Can I turn it off for privacy?
You can, though we don’t recommend it. At any point, your device can become a regular smoke alarm if there's either no internet connection or if you choose the privacy mode where it will stop broadcasting. Birdi keeps your information private and accessible only by those you choose to trust.




Up to FAQ
6a:
Can it monitor Carbon Monoxide if its mounted on the ceiling? 
Yes. According to the CO guidelines of the National Fire Protection Association, carbon monoxide alarms should “be centrally located outside of each separate sleeping area in the immediate vicinity of the bedrooms,” and each alarm should “be located on the wall, ceiling or other location” according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.
There’s a common myth that carbon
monoxide (CO) sensors are supposed to be placed at “knee height” because CO is
heavier than air. CO is actually slightly lighter than air and diffuses evenly
through rooms. Besides, the source of carbon monoxide is usually warm, like a boiler. In this case the carbon monoxide containing air will be more likely to rise to higher areas of your home. Typical sensors are often plugged into wall outlets as a convenient power
source, placing them close to the floor in rooms. 
Besides, we give you pre-warnings that
show you visualizations of carbon monoxide levels, even if they’re not yet an emergency.
6b:
Does it work with… (my connected lock, camera, security system, etc.)?
Our OpenAPI will allow certain integrations to work out of the box. As a regulated security
device, there are certain difficulties with opening the platform SDK and ensuring
the required reliability. At the same time, we believe a truly smart home is an
open one. 
6c:
Will there be an SDK or API?
Birdi would love to have an SDK.
Unfortunately, this is a device to ensure security and because of that have to
limit some functionality. Having an open API is very important to us too and
this we can achieve. We want to give everyone more details about the air we're
all breathing and want data scientists to help develop those insights and
developers to create cool new solutions.




Up to FAQ
7a:
What are the challenges?
Smoke alarms tend to be annoying. And air quality devices are confusing and expensive. While the sensors exist and are reliable, combining the functionality
is truly unique and there's nothing else out there which comes even close. We're working with the top manufacturing experts to bring this device into
every home with realistic and achievable deadlines and promise to be open and
transparent about any delays that come up which are beyond our control.
7b:
Where are you crafting this product?
Birdi is designed in Brooklyn, developed
in San Francisco, and manufactured in Shenzhen. Deciding where to produce
products is never easy these days. For Birdi, we started at the Cleanweb
Hackathon in NYC and worked on our industrial design and graphic design from
there. Then we joined Highway1 in San Francisco and started building the next
iterations of the technology, beyond our initial prototype. For manufacturing,
we needed to go to China, the sensor capital of the world, since our product is
packed full of them. Throughout, we want to make sure that our production
process is transparent and sustainable. If you’d like, you can even see who
we’re working with and learn about the conditions there. It’s important to us
that everyone who touches Birdi is positively affected and that includes the
workers who build our product to the customers who enjoy it.


7c:
How environmentally friendly are you?
It’s important to us that making Birdi
doesn’t have a negative impact on air quality. We’re making Birdi as green as
possible from the packaging to the casing to the factories that they’re built
in. While every other smoke detector and air quality monitor is made from oil,
ours is actually made from pollution. That’s right, we’re removing pollution
from the air to make our case. It’s recaptured CO2, and we hope to set a
precedent for other companies to follow suit. Our production line has a team of
specialists to constantly monitor it to find ways to improve environmental
sustainability. Worker health as social sustainability is important to us too.
So much that Birdi is available in some of the factories so that we can monitor
the air there and work to improve it. And of course, our packaging is 100%
recycled and recyclable. Once the sensors are no longer active, around 7-10
years depending on our testing, we’ll help guide you to local recycling facilities to
reduce the environmental impact at the product’s end of life.

Who made the music for your video?
The guys at WE Sound Labs were incredible
to work with. Quick, responsive and solid. http://wesoundlabs.com
7f:
Does it work for the deaf, blind or otherwise handicapped?
We're doing what we can to make sure that our system works for people with all kinds of disabilities, in ways that traditional smoke alarms never have. Curtis from Florida reached out to us
early in our development and mentioned that he lives with two deaf people. He
requested that we build Birdi with accessibility in mind and we responded. In addition to the visual alerts that people receive on their phones in case
they can’t hear the alarm, we also have a color-coded system (green for good,
red for trouble), that flash from the device. Since nearly 10% of the country
is color blind, we also make sure that it flashes in different patterns
depending on the state of the emergency. 
7g:
Does the device
talk?
Birdi
sends you verbal notifications directly to your phone, otherwise, we sound the
alarm, blasting the siren as loud as we can so that you and your loved ones can
get to safety. Our service also talks directly to 911, letting the right people
know about the emergency as soon as possible. 
7h:
How loud is the
siren?
LOUD.
Regulations mean that the alarm has to be 85 decibels (dB) at 3 feet, which is critical in an emergency. We’re
louder. How loud is that? Well to give you some idea, a train whistle is 90dB
at 500 feet.
7i:
Did you change your name?
We were initially called Canary, as in
the “canary in a coal mine” that would tell you if there’s a gas leak by dying.
That was pretty morbid, besides, there are a lot of products on the market
called Canary from the past few decades. We like the “a little birdy told me”
analogy a lot more.

</div></div>","We are jamii fund  In January of 2013, jamii fund was founded in West Palm Beach, Florida. Our founders are a close-knit group of people with a passion for helping others. We set out on a mission to put an end to one of the biggest problems facing the hardworking citizens of the United States; medical debt. We did this because we believe that enough is enough. No longer should people have to sacrifice a meal to pay their hospital bills. No longer should someone have to refuse the care that could save their life, just because they don't have the money to for pay it. Enough is enough.We are focused on putting an end to this social injustice that has become commonplace in our society. We are helping real people, with real problems, and we're making a real change for the people that need it most. We are facing a very serious challenge, and we know that it may sound crazy, but medical debt can become a thing of the past in our lifetime. Join us in making that dream a reality.   What We Need & What You Get We are trying to raise $10,000 to get our feet off of the ground. We will use this money to pay all of our startup fees, build a user-friendly website to host our fundraising efforts, and create marketing opportunities to expand our influence. All of that will not cost $10,000, so what remains will be disbursed among the people that we are already helping.

<p><span> </span></p>
<p><span>As the passenger on a scooter on June 26 of 2012, I was struck by an uninsured motorcyclist and sustained severe injuries.

<p><span> </span></p>
<p><span>I have had 3 surgeries in the year since the accident. The immediate trauma surgery, a bone graft from pelvic bone to my injured femur, and the last surgery was March 5 of 2013- to clean up scar tissue behind my right knee (which was preventing my knee from bending) and to replace hardware in my leg.

<p>My name is Renee, I am writing asking for help for my dear friend Robin Griffin and her family. Robin and her three sons have been struggling for over 3 years with several rare medical diagnoses. Her oldest son Daniel is 17.  He has Chiari Malformation, Ehlers Danlos Syndrome (EDS), Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome, Tethered Cord Syndrome, Cranio-cervical Instability, True Right Single Coronary Artery, VSD and Basilar Invagination.  In three short years he has endured 2 brain surgeries, tethered spinal cord surgery, rib graft surgery, heart catherization for 2 congenital heart defects and occipital cervical fusion, (fusion of skull down to c3).  His cranio-cervical instability and Chiari was life threatening and serious because it was causing both anterior and posterior compression of the brainstem.  These surgeries were necessary for his safety and quality of life. He still struggles with oxygen levels dropping to low 80's in certain positions.</p>
<p>Her middle son Stephen is 13 and also has EDS, Post Concussive Syndrome, Cranio-vertebral Instability, Basilar Invagination, Short term memory loss and CAPD. His instability and Basilar invagination also life threatening requiring occipital cervical fusion (fusion skull to c2) with rib graft. He too is suspected of having Tethered Cord Syndrome. </p>
<p>Her youngest son Hunter is 5. Although he has not been confirmed due to his age as formally having EDS it is strongly suspected. He has Autism and Oral Dyspraxia and has been receiving intervention services since he was 8 months old. His MRI has also revealed the same cervical instability issues as his brothers and one day may also require surgical intervention. </p>
<p>Robin is 46 years old, she too has EDS. She has had cervical fusion of c1 &amp; c2, hip graft surgery and Tethered Spinal Cord release surgery with symptomatic Tarlov Cysts removed.  She also has preglaucoma and an enlarged optic nerve and Intercranial Hypertension.  He instability was compressing her vertebral artery on rotation.  </p>
<p><strong>Chiari (kee-ar-ee) Malformation</strong> - is a hind brain herniation of the cerebellar tonsils/lower brain down and out of the skull and into the neck. It is caused by a malformation of bones within or near the skull and/or the pulling from below by Tethered Cord Syndrome. Daniel's Chiari herniated 12mm where it lead to compression of his brainstem and obstruction of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).</p>
<p><strong>Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS)</strong> is a connective tissue disorder. Connective tissue acts like ""glue"" in the human body, holding everything together. Collagen, a protein that adds strength to the connective tissues, is not produced correctly in an individual with EDS. The resulting weak connective tissues are too weak to hold the organs, ligaments, joints, etc. of the body in place. It is currently separated into 6 major types.</p>
<p>Robin's family has Hypermobility EDS with vascular components. </p>
<p>Individuals with EDS are at risk for cranio-spinal instability (CSI), which often results in cranial settling. In cranial settling the tissues in the neck are so weak (due to EDS) that the cervical bones are not held in place. Slumping or collapsing onto itself occurs. This usually leads to abnormal angles/malformations of various bones and this can lead to both anterior and posterior brainstem compression. These malformations force the cerebellar tonsils out of the skull into the spinal column through the small hole at the base of the skull called the foramen magnum, a phenomena called cerebellar herniation, AKA Chiari. When the cerebellar tonsils are out of place, they take up space normally allotted for the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF), the brainstem, and all the arteries and veins leading through this area to the brain. Blockage can be both posterior and anterior. The cerebellar tonsils are the lowest part of the cerebellum, which controls the sensory perception and motor control systems of the body. The brainstem controls the autonomic nervous system, or everything your body does without you having to think about it, heart rate, respiration, blood pressure control, etc. Damage to these systems is very serious. CSI may also allow the Odontoid bone at the front of the neck to angle into the brainstem (Retroflexed Odontoid), causing even more concerns, such as Basilar Invagination or Basilar Impression. (Brainstem Compression). Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS) is a type of dysautonomia. It is also commonly seen with individuals who have EDS and EDS with Chiari as a result of brainstem concerns. In addition to this, an individual with EDS and instability is at risk of subluxation (partial dislocation of bones) of the neck or abnormal sliding of the skull in flex/extension, further compromising the brainstem, tonsils and vertebral arteries. Making this life threatening for some.</p>
<p><strong>Tethered Cord Syndrome (TCS)</strong> -  In this condition, a band of connective tissue called the filum is wrapped around the base of the spinal cord and exerting pressure on the nerves that go to the legs, pelvis, bladder and bowel. This leads to leg pain, weakness, numbness, scoliosis and many more issues.</p>
<p>Robin and her sons struggle daily with various significant neurological symptoms involving the brainstem and EDS (and for Daniel also the cerebellar functions).  Some of the symptoms they struggle with are severe headaches, neck pain from subluxations, tinnitus, swallowing difficulties, visual disturbances or vision loss, a sensation of pressure behind the eyes, autonomic nervous system dysfunction (POTS, neurally mediated hypotension), sleep disturbances, brain fog, (seizure for Daniel), memory issues and over all full body joint instability causing painful dislocations and subluxations.</p>
<p><strong>There is no cure for these conditions</strong>, only stablization for better quality of life.  Although the surgeries have been successful in treating their major concerns and easing some of their pain there are still issues that will be life long. They continue to go to physical therapy to which they have been in for 3 years.</p>
<p><strong>Because their combined conditions are very complex few doctors are able to help them.  They are fortunate to have an expert pain management doctor locally however their neurosurgeon and geneticist are located in Maryland, Cardiology in Boston and NY.  Robin, her husband and sons live in New York State.  The combined total of 8 surgeries and constant traveling 6.5 hours out of state one way for surgery, tests, and follow-up appointments has taken a great toll on them both emotionally and financially. They have insurance but it's limited for out of network benefits.   After processing they still owe several thousand dollars and have more upcoming appointments to attend to out of state. Estimated bills owed currently are around $10,000.  More expenses will be coming up and more bills owed as more tests are need and possible surgeries too.  They struggle daily in trying to make ends meet, living pay check to pay check.  </strong></p>
<p><strong>They recently learned their secondary insurance which should have covered the out of state co-pay expenses for surgery will not be.  This was devastating news. The bills owed will increase more as a result. </strong></p>
<p>Robin is the rock of the family and an inspiration to many who share these diagnoses. She has worked hard in getting her sons and herself to the doctors they need, sacrificing what she can to do it.  She is unable to work due to the pain associated with EDS, her older son is also part-time home bound from school because pain and endurance limit his ability to atttend school. In addition to devoting her time to helping her sons she also spreads awareness of these rare complex conditions by successfully managing a support group of nearly 900 members online.   I’d like to help her through this difficult journey like she has helped so many others. </p>
<p>Please help the Griffin family any you can, any donation big or small can make a huge difference! You can also help by saying a prayer for them, sharing this page with all of your contacts, whether through email, facebook or twitter. </p>
<p>Thank you SO very much! </p>

There is no cure for these conditions, only stablization for better quality of life.  Although the surgeries have been successful in treating their major concerns and easing some of their pain there are still issues that will be life long. They continue to go to physical therapy to which they have been in for 3 years.
Because their combined conditions are very complex few doctors are able to help them.  They are fortunate to have an expert pain management doctor locally however their neurosurgeon and geneticist are located in Maryland, Cardiology in Boston and NY.  Robin, her husband and sons live in New York State.  The combined total of 8 surgeries and constant traveling 6.5 hours out of state one way for surgery, tests, and follow-up appointments has taken a great toll on them both emotionally and financially. They have insurance but it's limited for out of network benefits.   After processing they still owe several thousand dollars and have more upcoming appointments to attend to out of state. Estimated bills owed currently are around $10,000.  More expenses will be coming up and more bills owed as more tests are need and possible surgeries too.  They struggle daily in trying to make ends meet, living pay check to pay check.  
They recently learned their secondary insurance which should have covered the out of state co-pay expenses for surgery will not be.  This was devastating news. The bills owed will increase more as a result. 
Robin is the rock of the family and an inspiration to many who share these diagnoses. She has worked hard in getting her sons and herself to the doctors they need, sacrificing what she can to do it.  She is unable to work due to the pain associated with EDS, her older son is also part-time home bound from school because pain and endurance limit his ability to atttend school. In addition to devoting her time to helping her sons she also spreads awareness of these rare complex conditions by successfully managing a support group of nearly 900 members online.   I’d like to help her through this difficult journey like she has helped so many others. 
Please help the Griffin family any you can, any donation big or small can make a huge difference! You can also help by saying a prayer for them, sharing this page with all of your contacts, whether through email, facebook or twitter. 
Thank you SO very much!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<b>1a: How many iRemember devices do I need in my home?
</b><p>Depends on the level of medicine usage of your family. Each iRemember fits one box of pills. We recommend to have iRemember device for you and each one of your family members who use medicines on a regular basis.<br/></p>
<p><strong>1b: Can I use iRemember to monitor the doses taken by my child or elderly parent?</strong></p>
<p>Sure! You can let them use iRemember and monitor their medication usage from the same app. Moreover, multiple people can access the same iRemember device from their apps, if you grant them access.</p>
<p><strong>1c: Can anyone set up iRemember?</strong></p>
<p>Absolutely! iRemember was designed for the purpose of making installation a thing of the past. iRemember is one single device, designed for everyone to be able to use. Simply, take it out of the box, set time interval and you're done. It’s that easy.</p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>2a: What are the shipping costs?</strong></p>
<p>All shipping in the US is free of charge. There is additional cost for international shipping. Shipment does not include extra fees from customs, or additional costs associated with your country. If it turns out that shipment to your country proves impossible, we will reimburse your order.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>2b: When is the soonest I can get iRemember?</strong></p>
<p>Estimated shipping dates for the device begin in June 2015. Our goal is to have the shipment out to you earlier but we wanted to make sure not to overpromise. we are working around the clock to bring this to market, and as soon as it’s ready, it will be sent out to you!</p>

<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong><strong>3a: Can I connect multiple iRemember devices with my mobile device?</strong></strong></p>

 A smart yet simple device that will notify when you or your loved ones took their last dose of pills - and will remind you when to take the next one.Notifications can be provided directly to cap or to your mobile device.

The perfect solution for the entire family







iRemember is easy to setup on different sizes of pill bottles or organizers.It monitors the times of doses taken so it can alert you if your family forgot to take their pills on time.Moreover, iRemember can tell when was the last time a dose was taken by simply pressing the top button of the device or using the mobile app. 


Simple to understand and intuitive to use

iRemember setup takes less than 1 minute. All is needed is to choose the way and how often you would like the notifications.


In order to activate the mobile option - simply download the app and connect it to your iRemember device. Integrating iRemember with your mobile device enables great features such as notifications to family members/professionals and a battery level indicator. iRemember can even sync to your calander and setup your medication schedule.




 
Receive notifications from anywhere

With iRemember, the app and primary service are free and can be integrated with as many iRemember devices as you'd like. That means you can download the free app and receive notifications from all family members. 
Moreover, future development will enable more data options such as heads up before you run out of pills, sending vocal massages to your family caps and FDA updates. iRemember can also be used without any phone integration. 


Anyone will use it

All shipping in the US is free of charge. There is additional cost for international shipping. Shipment does not include extra fees from customs, or additional costs associated with your country. If it turns out that shipment to your country proves impossible, we will reimburse your order.

<p><strong>My name is Sandra Taylor. I live in Lake Worth, Florida. I have a beautiful family, and a goofy Great-Dane dog named Jake. In my hometown, Costa Rica, I have the rest of my large family.</strong></p>
<p><strong>But, our family is incomplete, and we want to adopt our beloved Samantha and bring her to the USA to live with us.</strong></p>
<p><strong>What are we doing:</strong></p>
<p><strong>We’ve been trying to adopt Samantha for five years now, since she was two days old! She is a Costa Rican child, and her legal guardians are my sister and her husband. The international adoption process was moving along just fine for the first year, and all the adoption papers were submitted. But, suddenly Costa Rica froze all international adoptions for three years, due to a moratorium—a law process that interfered with adoptions.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Well, during these three years Samantha grew happy and beautiful, sweet and easy going. Unfortunately, she also got sick! She got ""nephrotic syndrome,""a condition where the filters in the kidneys become leaky, releasing large amounts of proteins into the bloodstream, causing ""oedema"" or fluid retention that causes swelling.</strong></p>
<p><br/><strong>Samantha’s face, legs, and stomach swelled up, and she started to complain about being tired and that she had stomach aches. One morning her eyes were swelled shut, and we rushed her to the hospital, where they admitted her for fifteen days. It was a horrible experience for all of us, and she learned to be terrified of needles and nurses in general. She has been sick three times, same problem, and the doctor in Costa Rica gives her heavy doses of steroid medication that last up to 6 months to reduce the swelling, and help alleviate other issues. The problem is that this recurrence of the disease/medication weakens her kidneys, and there is the probability that she may come down with kidney failure...</strong></p>
<p><strong>Our family is stressed out of our minds! We pray constantly and cry a lot. We need help adopting Samantha, so we can place her under the care of a renal specialist that may cure her, before she needs kidney replacement.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What we need:</strong></p>
<p><strong>The international process of adoption is open again, but our original papers are outdated, and Costa Rica requires a new set of them. It happens that our funds are exhausted, and we are in a difficult financial situation. We need to put together $20,000 to cover: </strong></p>

</ul><p><strong>The impact:</strong></p>
<p><strong>For Samantha, your support means the difference between a healthy life, or one of dealing with the horrors of kidney dialysis or transplants. Your help will bring her beauty and personality forward; she will be a happy baby, not one that suffers on a daily basis.</strong></p>
<p><strong>What you’ll get:</strong></p>

<h3>Christine's Story</h3>
<p>Hello! My name is Christine and I have been an aerialist for five years and have been dancing since I was three years old. After graduating from college with a double major of dance &amp; biology, I decided to put my pre-physical therapy degree aside (temporarily) and pursue my performance dreams. Since then, I have been living a simple life dedicated to training, performing, and teaching both aerials and dance. I am very lucky and very grateful to be able to support myself entirely on performing &amp; teaching.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I perform for many different kinds of events from festivals &amp; churches to clubs and conferences. Most of my performance work was with a small juggling company that did a lot of shows for school aged children. Kids' faces light up when they see someone flying and defying gravity. It's amazing. Teaching was my other income. Giving people the strength and courage to do the impossible is a very satisfying thing. When you work hard to defy odds and succeed, you want to show others that it is entirely possible! When your students make progress, you succeed. I don't own a fancy car or live in a swanky house, but I sure am happy doing what I love.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On October 14, 2012, I had an accident which shattered my wrists and dislocated my elbow. I was hospitalized for seven days, in casts on both arms for over two weeks, and then I was in a hinged elbow brace for over a month. The surgeon is happy with my progress and has told me that if I work hard every day, that I will be back in the air and back to my life! It has been a long couple of months, and I am still not quite there. I have a lot more healing to do, followed by a lot of strengthening, conditioning and stretching. Needless to say, I will be out of work for at least a couple more months...</p>
<p> </p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Where Exactly Is Your Generous Contribution Going? </h3>
<p>I did not have health insurance when I got hurt. Since my accident, I have been getting by solely because of the generous help and love of my friends and family. Medical bills keep rolling in and are now over $55,000. We are making every attempt we can to get discounted rates and charity care, but we are unsure of how much that will cover. So here I am, asking for your help to pay these bills so that I can get back to inspiring and spreading smiles, strength &amp; courage to as many people as I can. </p>
<p> </p>

<h3>What Do You Get In Return?</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The benefit show in Philadelphia on Saturday January 12, 2013 was amazing and wownderful. I am so grateful and blessed and lucky to have such magnificent, talented, generous people in my life. The performances of dance, circus, physical theater, and jazz trio performances were perfect and more than i could have ever asked for. We had two packed shows thanks to each of you! I hope you all enjoyed it.</p>

An Amazingly Generous Donation of $1500 will get you a video of a complete aerial act made just for you to the song of your choice.
 
If my goal is not reached, whatever money that is collected will still go towards my medical bills. As I said before, they are well over $55,000. The goal on this site is set low... feel free to go above and beyond! ;)
 
 


 
The Impact
Your contributions will help me get back into the air to start work on new pieces and shows, and to start teaching again! 
The mother of two students who I have been teaching private aerial lessons to over the past year wrote: 
""I know they both feel that they would not have been able to do aerial acts at camp without your teaching and Jeremy is a better dancer because of it.  That was a little boy who couldn't climb a rope and now he can climb it and hang upside down from it while doing acrobatic moves!!!!  It not only helped him physically but also helped to boost his self-esteem.  You helped to change his life.
 
I hope everything works out for you and we are anxious to get back as soon as you are ready.""

<p>JoyWheel Yoga &amp; Wellness thrives because of its dedication
to authentically serving individuals. We support local schools with free
classes for athletes on their own campus, we adopt a family each month to
receive free yoga classes with total anonymity and zero strings attached, and
we open up the space for others to use. Some examples include: <i>A Talk
on Consciousness,</i> where local high school students discussed and a
professional panel of speakers, how to be more mindful in the modern world. The
talk was well received buy the broader community and inspired a second free
comminty event held in June, about Education Choices. Both talks were offered
by the Academe of Aurora, a local high school group. We also hosted a Poetry
Slam for Crossroads Springs Africa (CSA) Institute, a not-for Profit in Kenya
that supports over 350 children who have lost at least one parent to AIDS, and
we share the space for local support groups, and book clubs to enjoy. 100% of
the proceeds form this event went to CSA, and many shared their creative works
whilst supporting a worthy cause. This event also inspired a second and third
event similar in nature. People seek to ""be good and do good,"" when
given the opportunity to do so. We are thrilled to offer many such opportunities.</p>
<p><b>Planet: </b></p>
<p>The studio itself is filled with recycled materials from
reclaimed barn wood and re-purposed goods to recycled paper products. We
believe in ecologically conscious living and working, so we model that
behavior. By remaining locally minded, we have had the privilege to work with
local businesses, artisans, and craftsmen in order to grow and maintain the
space.</p>
<p>Imagine a center where
interactions on every level were based on respect, honoring each other, a space
where wellness professionals collaborate to meet students, clients, and
peoples' needs. We are a collaborative minded space that does not seek to
compete but rather to network and work together within the yoga and mindfulness
community as well as the local WNY community… and the world in total in order
to serve one another! We reduce aggressive behaviors and model compassion,
tolerance, patience and peaceful interactions, making the planet a better pace
to live.</p>
<p><b>Profits:</b></p>
<p>WE OFFER VARIETY AND ACCESSIBILITY</p>
<p>This yoga studio and wellness serves as a community
resource for health and wellness care. By following a triple bottom Line
business model we use an ethical fresh approach during every step of business;
we hope to be a leader for other businesses worldwide. That means we reinvest profits
into the center and all of the people who patronize it.</p>
<p>JoyWheel Yoga &amp; Wellness, located inthe heart of the village of East Aurora, NY, currently runs as a yoga
studio with a student base of over 600 registered students. It was established
in May of 2013 and transitioned to a space triple its original size during the
winter. Many of those same students seek out and receive extra wellness
services such as massage and yoga therapy in a private setting or small group
setting. With the demand increasing for more wellness services, the expansion
into a full service community wellness center is the natural progression of the
entity. There will be 5 Wellness Suites located above the yoga studio where wellness professionals can work together to meet the needs of individuals, small groups, schools, and the community.</p><p><b>Challenges:</b></p><p>Our limitation right now is lack of assistance. The students and community have allowed us to grow, however we are in need of more administrative assistance and the proper programming / technology to allow JWY&amp;W to expand and serve all those looking for services. With funding we will hire competent staff that believes in our mission in order to meet students, clients, and all who seek assistance.

Imagine a center where
interactions on every level were based on respect, honoring each other, a space
where wellness professionals collaborate to meet students, clients, and
peoples' needs. We are a collaborative minded space that does not seek to
compete but rather to network and work together within the yoga and mindfulness
community as well as the local WNY community… and the world in total in order
to serve one another! We reduce aggressive behaviors and model compassion,
tolerance, patience and peaceful interactions, making the planet a better pace
to live.

WE OFFER VARIETY AND ACCESSIBILITY
This yoga studio and wellness serves as a community
resource for health and wellness care. By following a triple bottom Line
business model we use an ethical fresh approach during every step of business;
we hope to be a leader for other businesses worldwide. That means we reinvest profits
into the center and all of the people who patronize it.
JoyWheel Yoga & Wellness, located inthe heart of the village of East Aurora, NY, currently runs as a yoga
studio with a student base of over 600 registered students. It was established
in May of 2013 and transitioned to a space triple its original size during the
winter. Many of those same students seek out and receive extra wellness
services such as massage and yoga therapy in a private setting or small group
setting. With the demand increasing for more wellness services, the expansion
into a full service community wellness center is the natural progression of the
entity. There will be 5 Wellness Suites located above the yoga studio where wellness professionals can work together to meet the needs of individuals, small groups, schools, and the community.Challenges:Our limitation right now is lack of assistance. The students and community have allowed us to grow, however we are in need of more administrative assistance and the proper programming / technology to allow JWY&W to expand and serve all those looking for services. With funding we will hire competent staff that believes in our mission in order to meet students, clients, and all who seek assistance. We look forward to offering job sources to the WNY community,
Gratitude:We thank you in advance for your willingness
to serve and be a part of this mindful movement. Every thought, every effort,
and every choice makes a difference. We feel your love and we are grateful. ~Namaste",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Poses are presented and modified to each individual's ability. The size of our thighs, arms, bellies, and butts all change the way we are capable of expressing the traditional asanas (poses).

<p>Fat Yoga currently holds ongoing classes through the week at

Fat Yoga also provides more intangible benefits such as increased confidence, better balance, and a general feeling of bad-assery. </span></p>
<h3>The Video Project</h3>
<p>The Fat Yoga videos will put you right into our All Levels
Classes.  Classes are structured so each person has autonomy over their
own yoga practice. Focus is on breath, alignment and postures through the basic
Sun Salutation poses. We'll develop an awareness of and connection to our body’s
amazing capabilities. This type of practice fosters active lifestyles, by
awaking &amp; activating core strength. These classes bring the heat, working
ourselves right up to a nice, glistening sheen, while still allowing space for
a gentle practice. We will cover the whole body; shoulders, arms, chest,
ribcage, hips and legs.  </p>
<p>The videos will be presented in a series of 15 short videos
that can be put together into a customizable yoga session.  These videos
will allow you to have variety in your workout day-to-day; almost like a
choose-your-own adventure!</p>
<p>We have chosen a local video production company to make the

<p>When I was an occupational therapy student, a classmate asked me what area of OT I would like to work in. It took a few minutes - if that - to know what I wanted to be involved in. I had a vision of a treatment centre that I wanted to develop. A year later I developed an infection that turned chronic. Through my journey to regain my health I discovered another dimension - which has led to my developing a new model. The journey has given me much insight and has enabled me to develop services that are pioneering in my field - and which my OT mentor terms trail blazing. This journey has been written into a book which I need funds to edit in preparation of publishing.</p>
<p>You can see the services that I offer on my website <a href=""http://www.beahappymom.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.beahappymom.com </a></p>
<p>When I got married, my husband joined me in adding the Torah dimension to what I do. There have been two hurdles to overcome in making this dream a reality. One has been lack of understanding and recognition of the profession of occupational therapy, and the other has been funding. The lack of understanding has at times interfered with obtaining the necessary funding.</p>
<p>A few years ago, we began producing books that share important concepts of respecting others, increasing one's knowledge of Torah (the Bible) and improving one's health and well being. The aim of these books is to share these important concepts and to create products that will help us to generate the funds necessary to build a sustainable Torah and healing centre.</p>
<p>We have 4 books out thus far:</p>
<p>- ""<strong><a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Tuvia-Finds-His-Freedom-illustrated/dp/1508535302"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Tuvia Finds His Freedom</a></strong>"" is a nature story for children, available in English and Hebrew (i.e. 2 books). This book was written to share some ideas of how easy it is to help a lost animal. In a world where the news is filled with acts of cruelty, we aim to help children to internalize the importance of showing kindness and respect to all of creation, including plants, animals and the environment, and from there to extend to other children and adults too.</p>
<p>- ""<a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Parshah-Just-Two-Minutes-Summaries/dp/1530446546"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Parshah in Just Two Minutes!</strong></a>"" is a book of summaries of each Aliyah to the Torah (7 in total) for each weekly portion. The book is written to help the beginner-to-Torah get to know the most important stories and flow of Torah, while providing an invaluable summary / review for the Torah scholar.</p>
<p>- ""<a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Healing-Your-Life-Through-Activity/dp/1535161604"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Healing Your Life Through Activity - An Occupational Therapist's Story</strong></a>"" is the first of several books to educate on the importance of having an active life of meaning and purpose. This book is written for the non-OT, assisting them to learn about the vast and incredible profession of occupational therapy. It is hoped that this book will help to overcome the hurdle of the limited understanding of the profession.</p>
<p>It might sound impressive that we have 4 books in print that we have published! Every detail involved in the process from idea to completed book has been carried out by ourselves.  However, we need your help to enhance the books, to cover expenses incurred from bringing them to print. We also require funds to market / promote these books in order to reach our readers and to continue producing further quality books.</p>
<p>""Tuvia Finds His Freedom"" is in need of a workbook to accompany it. In order to make this a reality we need to hire a good illustrator who can assist with certain drawings that I have struggled to draw effectively. Once this workbook is complete we will need to translate it into Hebrew as we did for the book itself. Later we hope to add other books - making this a series with different animals so that children can learn the importance of treating animals correctly and appropriately.</p>
<p>Having the package of book and workbook will enable us to begin offering workshops related to learning about the animals, and important concepts such as kindness to animals, nature and the environment.</p>
<p>""Parshah In Just Two Minutes!"" is currently undergoing a revision. The new version will have letters of approbation to support it and a number of improvements. We need your help to be able to devote the time to improving this book and then to market it effectively.</p>
<p>""Healing Your Life Through Activity - An Occupational Therapist's Story"" is also being improved. I am working on obtaining further letters to support the book - which requires mailing copies of the book often internationally. When running the previous crowd fundraiser, we did not bring in sufficient funds to have the book professionally edited. The book is currently being worked on to ensure that it is a top quality finished product. An important appendix has also been added. We need your help to complete the revisions, cover costs of mailing copies where necessary, translating the book into Hebrew and of course for effective marketing and promotion.</p>
<p>We are also in need of improving certain software and equipment e.g. our cameras and a video camera for educational videos or photographs to support our work, promote our work and to be used within further publications or in developing online courses.</p>
<p>The books and online courses are two income streams that we are developing in order to help for the centre to be sustainable. Another income stream is the renting out of our 59 bridal gowns. The bridal gowns actually form part of a larger service offered for new brides. As you can see in the video, the room for the bridal gowns is too small. Thus far <strong>every bride that has come to view our bridal gowns has complained about the lack of space</strong>. The limited space also prevents me from offering certain other services that I have developed. Without the income from renting the bridal gowns, we lack the funds to continue our service assisting orphan brides and grooms at the time they marry.</p>
<p><strong>SOME OF THE SERVICES OF THE CENTRE:</strong></p>
<p>The full vision of the centre has two divisions to it. The services offered on my website: <a href=""http://www.beahappymom"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.beahappymom</a> represent the women's division of this centre. These services are all structured to assist women to fulfill the important life roles of wife and mother. There are 4 main groupings to these services:</p>
<ol>
<li>To assist Jewish women to reach the goal of becoming a wife</li>
<li>To assist Jewish women to reach the goal of becoming a mother</li>
<li>To assist Jewish women to reach the goal of becoming a happy mother, meaning that they will be happy in this role and fulfill it to the optimum</li>
</ol>
<p>Certain services offered for children that assist with category 2 and 3.</p>
<p>These services can be viewed on my <a href=""http://www.beahappymom.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">website</a>. Services are both individual and in group and hence there is a need for treatment rooms for individual consultation and for group intervention. The needs for the treatment room for women differs to that necessary for children. An example of a group workshop is the one mentioned above helping children to understand why and how to respect and show kindness to our environment, plants, animals and then to extend this to people too. Two of our needs in order to offer these workshops is the workbook to accompany the book we have written and the suitable room for children to attend and participate. If we can meet our goal, we'd love for the centre to also have a beautiful garden and possibly even a pet corner as there are so many therapeutic benefits of nature.</p>
<p>Many of the services offered to women are trailblazing and these are some that I mentioned in the video I require funding in order to write up in professional journals. I have a list of at least 10  books to write and several courses to develop. The courses will be geared at teaching other occupational therapists the services that I have discovered the need for and developed.</p>
<p>To answer the question many are posing about the bridal gowns. In truth, we had a store as well. We have temporarily had to put the store on hold as we had to let go of all of our stock when moving back to Jerusalem, due to lack of space. Both the store and the bridal gowns aim to support our work to empower orphans and hopefully widows too. These two services require space to house them and are developed in order to fund the service to empower orphans. Yes, occupational therapy has a role to play in assisting orphans which is another area that I need to write up in more detail. As mentioned in the video, the goal is for the orphans to be independent in all areas of their life. One aspect of that is financial independence. As I mentioned in the video 1 in 3 children in Israel live below the poverty line. Orphans and widows are more at risk of poverty than those who come from a stable, supportive family.</p>
<p>A few areas of intervention suitable to orphans would include grief therapy, play therapy, improving self-esteem, improving self-confidence, developing appropriate support system. There are other areas too, depending on the unique need of each orphan or widow.</p>
<p>If I can reach my goal, some of the rooms in the centre will be geared to assist with jobs skills and job creation. I also aim for some rooms to offer short-term accommodation where necessary. I aim to write the reason for this in a blog post or two. It is too lengthy to add here.</p>
<p>As you can see, by assisting us to bring this centre into being, some of the assistance will also go towards the time necessary to write, edit and develop articles, books and courses that add to the profession of occupational therapy. For those who are puzzled, yes, the new model that I developed does include OT combined with Torah and is one of the books and courses that I am working on.</p>
<p>To answer another question before it is asked, the areas that I have developed apply to all. Many of the books, blog posts and products are applicable to all too. The reason that my centre is specific to Jewish women is due to specific needs which I explain in my book about OT and Torah.</p>
<p>We ask you to make a generous donation to assist in helping the world to benefit from the knowledge and skills that we have to share. Our focus is in spreading ideas and information to improve kindness, respect, truth, unity and peace. In addition to the publications, we have services, some of which are offered in person and some online, that need the appropriate venue to make this a reality.</p>
<p>The pie chart listed here shows a breakdown of how funds will be utilized. Any and all donations are very greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Thank you for your assistance. We look forward to sharing the progress and developments in this exciting venture.</p>
</div><p> </p></div>","When I was an occupational therapy student, a classmate asked me what area of OT I would like to work in. It took a few minutes - if that - to know what I wanted to be involved in. I had a vision of a treatment centre that I wanted to develop. A year later I developed an infection that turned chronic. Through my journey to regain my health I discovered another dimension - which has led to my developing a new model. The journey has given me much insight and has enabled me to develop services that are pioneering in my field - and which my OT mentor terms trail blazing. This journey has been written into a book which I need funds to edit in preparation of publishing.
You can see the services that I offer on my website www.beahappymom.com 
When I got married, my husband joined me in adding the Torah dimension to what I do. There have been two hurdles to overcome in making this dream a reality. One has been lack of understanding and recognition of the profession of occupational therapy, and the other has been funding. The lack of understanding has at times interfered with obtaining the necessary funding.
A few years ago, we began producing books that share important concepts of respecting others, increasing one's knowledge of Torah (the Bible) and improving one's health and well being. The aim of these books is to share these important concepts and to create products that will help us to generate the funds necessary to build a sustainable Torah and healing centre.
We have 4 books out thus far:
- ""Tuvia Finds His Freedom"" is a nature story for children, available in English and Hebrew (i.e. 2 books). This book was written to share some ideas of how easy it is to help a lost animal. In a world where the news is filled with acts of cruelty, we aim to help children to internalize the importance of showing kindness and respect to all of creation, including plants, animals and the environment, and from there to extend to other children and adults too.
- ""Parshah in Just Two Minutes!"" is a book of summaries of each Aliyah to the Torah (7 in total) for each weekly portion. The book is written to help the beginner-to-Torah get to know the most important stories and flow of Torah, while providing an invaluable summary / review for the Torah scholar.
- ""Healing Your Life Through Activity - An Occupational Therapist's Story"" is the first of several books to educate on the importance of having an active life of meaning and purpose. This book is written for the non-OT, assisting them to learn about the vast and incredible profession of occupational therapy. It is hoped that this book will help to overcome the hurdle of the limited understanding of the profession.
It might sound impressive that we have 4 books in print that we have published! Every detail involved in the process from idea to completed book has been carried out by ourselves.  However, we need your help to enhance the books, to cover expenses incurred from bringing them to print. We also require funds to market / promote these books in order to reach our readers and to continue producing further quality books.
""Tuvia Finds His Freedom"" is in need of a workbook to accompany it. In order to make this a reality we need to hire a good illustrator who can assist with certain drawings that I have struggled to draw effectively. Once this workbook is complete we will need to translate it into Hebrew as we did for the book itself. Later we hope to add other books - making this a series with different animals so that children can learn the importance of treating animals correctly and appropriately.
Having the package of book and workbook will enable us to begin offering workshops related to learning about the animals, and important concepts such as kindness to animals, nature and the environment.
""Parshah In Just Two Minutes!"" is currently undergoing a revision. The new version will have letters of approbation to support it and a number of improvements. We need your help to be able to devote the time to improving this book and then to market it effectively.
""Healing Your Life Through Activity - An Occupational Therapist's Story"" is also being improved. I am working on obtaining further letters to support the book - which requires mailing copies of the book often internationally. When running the previous crowd fundraiser, we did not bring in sufficient funds to have the book professionally edited. The book is currently being worked on to ensure that it is a top quality finished product. An important appendix has also been added. We need your help to complete the revisions, cover costs of mailing copies where necessary, translating the book into Hebrew and of course for effective marketing and promotion.
We are also in need of improving certain software and equipment e.g. our cameras and a video camera for educational videos or photographs to support our work, promote our work and to be used within further publications or in developing online courses.
The books and online courses are two income streams that we are developing in order to help for the centre to be sustainable. Another income stream is the renting out of our 59 bridal gowns. The bridal gowns actually form part of a larger service offered for new brides. As you can see in the video, the room for the bridal gowns is too small. Thus far every bride that has come to view our bridal gowns has complained about the lack of space. The limited space also prevents me from offering certain other services that I have developed. Without the income from renting the bridal gowns, we lack the funds to continue our service assisting orphan brides and grooms at the time they marry.
SOME OF THE SERVICES OF THE CENTRE:
The full vision of the centre has two divisions to it. The services offered on my website: www.beahappymom represent the women's division of this centre. These services are all structured to assist women to fulfill the important life roles of wife and mother. There are 4 main groupings to these services:

To assist Jewish women to reach the goal of becoming a wife
To assist Jewish women to reach the goal of becoming a mother
To assist Jewish women to reach the goal of becoming a happy mother, meaning that they will be happy in this role and fulfill it to the optimum

Certain services offered for children that assist with category 2 and 3.
These services can be viewed on my website. Services are both individual and in group and hence there is a need for treatment rooms for individual consultation and for group intervention. The needs for the treatment room for women differs to that necessary for children. An example of a group workshop is the one mentioned above helping children to understand why and how to respect and show kindness to our environment, plants, animals and then to extend this to people too. Two of our needs in order to offer these workshops is the workbook to accompany the book we have written and the suitable room for children to attend and participate. If we can meet our goal, we'd love for the centre to also have a beautiful garden and possibly even a pet corner as there are so many therapeutic benefits of nature.
Many of the services offered to women are trailblazing and these are some that I mentioned in the video I require funding in order to write up in professional journals. I have a list of at least 10  books to write and several courses to develop. The courses will be geared at teaching other occupational therapists the services that I have discovered the need for and developed.
To answer the question many are posing about the bridal gowns. In truth, we had a store as well. We have temporarily had to put the store on hold as we had to let go of all of our stock when moving back to Jerusalem, due to lack of space. Both the store and the bridal gowns aim to support our work to empower orphans and hopefully widows too. These two services require space to house them and are developed in order to fund the service to empower orphans. Yes, occupational therapy has a role to play in assisting orphans which is another area that I need to write up in more detail. As mentioned in the video, the goal is for the orphans to be independent in all areas of their life. One aspect of that is financial independence. As I mentioned in the video 1 in 3 children in Israel live below the poverty line. Orphans and widows are more at risk of poverty than those who come from a stable, supportive family.
A few areas of intervention suitable to orphans would include grief therapy, play therapy, improving self-esteem, improving self-confidence, developing appropriate support system. There are other areas too, depending on the unique need of each orphan or widow.
If I can reach my goal, some of the rooms in the centre will be geared to assist with jobs skills and job creation. I also aim for some rooms to offer short-term accommodation where necessary. I aim to write the reason for this in a blog post or two. It is too lengthy to add here.
As you can see, by assisting us to bring this centre into being, some of the assistance will also go towards the time necessary to write, edit and develop articles, books and courses that add to the profession of occupational therapy. For those who are puzzled, yes, the new model that I developed does include OT combined with Torah and is one of the books and courses that I am working on.
To answer another question before it is asked, the areas that I have developed apply to all. Many of the books, blog posts and products are applicable to all too. The reason that my centre is specific to Jewish women is due to specific needs which I explain in my book about OT and Torah.
We ask you to make a generous donation to assist in helping the world to benefit from the knowledge and skills that we have to share. Our focus is in spreading ideas and information to improve kindness, respect, truth, unity and peace. In addition to the publications, we have services, some of which are offered in person and some online, that need the appropriate venue to make this a reality.
The pie chart listed here shows a breakdown of how funds will be utilized. Any and all donations are very greatly appreciated.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Did you know that the top 10 products in the OTC topical pain relief industry contain ingredients that are harmful?</p>
<p><i>There are two reasons for this:</i></p>
<p><strong>     1) </strong>Quality and safety regulations for cosmetics and skincare products in the U.S are low.</p>
<p><strong>     2) </strong>Cheap product ingredients make for larger profits.</p>
<p>These reasons give businesses a low barrier to entry into the topical pain relief industry. More importantly, the incentive to manufacture higher quality, eco-friendly products is not there. The end product suffers and benefits to the consumer are marginalized. That's why there are so many products with questionable contents flooding the pain relief marketplace.</p>
<p>Our brand is here because we saw a push from consumers for more natural, eco-friendly options for pain relief <i>with no compromise</i> on effectiveness. The push for better quality is already happening in the cosmetics industry and it is spilling into other skincare products.</p>
<p><i><strong>Topical pain relief is not a new thing. Our vision for a higher industry standard is. We are raising the bar.</strong></i><br/> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Introducing Battle Balm®, the all-natural, 100% plant-based topical pain reliever.<br/> </h3>

</div></div>","Short Summary
Did you know that the top 10 products in the OTC topical pain relief industry contain ingredients that are harmful?
There are two reasons for this:
     1) Quality and safety regulations for cosmetics and skincare products in the U.S are low.
     2) Cheap product ingredients make for larger profits.
These reasons give businesses a low barrier to entry into the topical pain relief industry. More importantly, the incentive to manufacture higher quality, eco-friendly products is not there. The end product suffers and benefits to the consumer are marginalized. That's why there are so many products with questionable contents flooding the pain relief marketplace.
Our brand is here because we saw a push from consumers for more natural, eco-friendly options for pain relief with no compromise on effectiveness. The push for better quality is already happening in the cosmetics industry and it is spilling into other skincare products.
Topical pain relief is not a new thing. Our vision for a higher industry standard is. We are raising the bar. 
Introducing Battle Balm®, the all-natural, 100% plant-based topical pain reliever. 

What makes us different?
We are not bringing you just another option for pain relief.
We are bringing you a BETTER option.
This is how:
   1)  We source premium quality grown safe ingredients from all over the world.
   2)  We incentivize farmers to grow crops without pesticides and soil damaging nutrients.
   3)  We responsibly manufacture products with the goal of reducing carbon emissions throughout our entire system.
   4)  We constantly research new and better technology to deliver unsurpassed quality with equal concern for sustainability and environmental impact.
   5)  We are creating longevity in the industry through our core values: honesty, transparency, and responsibility.
 

 
Battle Balm was born out of an acupuncture clinic that specialized in natural pain management. We started with a team of caring medical practitioners with the greatest intention to help others. Now, with your support, we can help others on a much larger scale.

<p><strong>If You Feel Anxiety and Stress</strong> – 77% of Americans report feeling regular physical symptoms tied to stress.

It affects our health in many ways, and this is a way to address the gravity of the situation.  </p>
<p>Deep Pressure Touch Stimulation helps you to unwind and relax without the expense of a massage or a day at the spa. The feeling of a full body hug helps your body to relax and your mind to let go of some of the worries. </p>

<p>The TRUBlanket™ is designed to be roughly 10% (or a little more) of a typical adult’s body weight. We didn’t stop at creating a blanket that is heavy. We found ways to masterfully craft the TRUBlanket™ truly to be the best weighted blanket out there. You’ll love snuggling under this blanket on the couch and in your bed!<br/> </p>
<p>First off: shifting weight and crunching sounds. Our unique stitching pattern keeps the weight distributed evenly and reduces noises. It’s anchored at extra points inside the cover, keeping the weight from bunching. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1529430398/nid0zsvm5t6qcwk70kdt.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>TRUBlanket™’s weight comes from clean polished glass beads instead of plastics that give off an odor and contain toxic chemicals. You can rest easy without worries.</p>
<p><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://j.gifs.com/L8pjNw.gif"" src=""""/></p>

<p>Hi, I’m Jason, founder of TRU Lite Bedding , a family-owned company that specializes in sleep and bedding products. We’re passionately committed helping families get great sleep, because that can affect every aspect of life. Getting good rest sets you up for healthy relationships, emotions, and physical well-being. <br/>I guess you could say the TRUBlanket™ is kind of a “family affair.” We discovered the benefits of weighted blankets while looking to help one of my sons, who struggles with anxiety. His symptoms got so bad that he only felt safe sleeping in our bedroom. After reading up on studies showing how the extra weight can help reduce the effects of anxiety, depression, PTSD, and other related mental health issues, we finally had hope for our son’s peace of mind. I’m delighted to say that it worked with the help of the weighted blanket, nutritional supplementation and emotional work!<br/>Inspired by amazing changes we saw as the result of a weighted blanket, we set to work creating an improved design for the best weighted blanket out there. That’s how the TRUBlanket™ came to be. With your help, we hope to bring the sense of peace and well-being that we’ve experienced to the world. </p>

</div></div>","Meet TRUBlanket: A Weighted Blanket for Today’s Stressful World
Imagine a blanket that could give you the same benefits as a full body hug. Weighted blankets have been used by medical professionals for decades to encourage relaxation and reduce stress. Deep Pressure Touch Stimulation uses the body’s own natural systems and create a sense of calm and safety. 

Now, you can experience the improved benefits of our superior quality weighted blanket for yourself!  TRUBlanket™ is an innovative option for those who find it difficult to fall asleep or need relief from stress and anxiety. 
 

 

Many people have found that the power of Deep Pressure Touch Stimulation has been helpful in their search for stress reduction and sleep quality! Weighted blankets are heavy to give you that extra bit of pressure so you feel just right in your bed. Don’t be surprised when you begin to sleep deeper and wake up more refreshed.   
Daily life is high-paced and stressful. When you can relax and unwind, you can rest easier. Your whole life is sweeter. Snuggling into a weighted blanket could be exactly what’s missing in your life!


 

Weighted blankets are highly regarded by medical experts. They have successfully been used in hospitals and in therapy for decades to support people who experience stress and sleep disturbances.    
Please note: the weighted blanket is not intended to cure or treat any medical conditions, but it's a great support tool.


 
If You Feel Anxiety and Stress – 77% of Americans report feeling regular physical symptoms tied to stress. We’re always multi-tasking, checking our devices, and generally on the go. Even when we make time to disconnect and relax, we feel wired and sick. It affects our health in many ways, and this is a way to address the gravity of the situation.  
Deep Pressure Touch Stimulation helps you to unwind and relax without the expense of a massage or a day at the spa. The feeling of a full body hug helps your body to relax and your mind to let go of some of the worries. 

 
If You Can't Sleep - Snuggle up to your TRUBlanket™ and let your mind wander! If your body is comfortable, it's easier to relax. Our heavy weighted blanket is incredibly cozy and pleasant to sleep on. 90% of people who use a weighted blanket report improved sleep patterns. They fall asleep easier, and they sleep deeper. We can't say for sure that you'll experience the same benefits, but it's definitely a great way to support healthy sleeping patterns.

Other Times a Blanket Helps – Those with sensory integration issues, ADHD, autism, or simply normal everyday stress often enjoy to use a weighted blanket. A long ride in the car or over-stimulation can lead to a meltdown, but TRUBlanket™ can provide the comfort to help a child relax.  TRUBlanket is also a great option for those who deal with PTSD, OCD, and a number of other stress-related symptoms. Remember, this is not a cure or treatment, just an aid. 


 


 

 

 


 


 
The TRUBlanket™ is designed to be roughly 10% (or a little more) of a typical adult’s body weight. We didn’t stop at creating a blanket that is heavy. We found ways to masterfully craft the TRUBlanket™ truly to be the best weighted blanket out there. You’ll love snuggling under this blanket on the couch and in your bed! 
First off: shifting weight and crunching sounds. Our unique stitching pattern keeps the weight distributed evenly and reduces noises. It’s anchored at extra points inside the cover, keeping the weight from bunching. 

 
TRUBlanket™’s weight comes from clean polished glass beads instead of plastics that give off an odor and contain toxic chemicals. You can rest easy without worries.

 
Our blanket design also includes an ultra-soft 400 thread count, making the blanket smooth to the touch and very breathable. Your body will always be at the perfect temperature.

It’s covered with a luxuriously soft plush minky cover that zips up for your convenience.

We included a high-quality embroidery on the blanket with the word ""Happiness"". We believe there is power in words, and it's our wish for everyone that uses this blanket to exude joy and happiness! 

 


 

Take action! Don’t let bad sleep and stress destroy your health - mitigate the risks instead. Get the sleep and relaxation you need and deserve – with TRU Blanket.
 


 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
We live in high-paced, stressful times. We’re always on the go, without taking time for self-care. Our minds and bodies need to relax and recharge from the constant bombardment of busy daily life and negativity that we deal with. Sometimes it’s hard to stop and just breathe. 
 

Picture the world outside melting away while you snuggle with your loved ones or pets. Read a good book, watch a funny movie. Relax and enjoy. 




Hi, I’m Jason, founder of TRU Lite Bedding , a family-owned company that specializes in sleep and bedding products. We’re passionately committed helping families get great sleep, because that can affect every aspect of life. Getting good rest sets you up for healthy relationships, emotions, and physical well-being. I guess you could say the TRUBlanket™ is kind of a “family affair.” We discovered the benefits of weighted blankets while looking to help one of my sons, who struggles with anxiety. His symptoms got so bad that he only felt safe sleeping in our bedroom. After reading up on studies showing how the extra weight can help reduce the effects of anxiety, depression, PTSD, and other related mental health issues, we finally had hope for our son’s peace of mind. I’m delighted to say that it worked with the help of the weighted blanket, nutritional supplementation and emotional work!Inspired by amazing changes we saw as the result of a weighted blanket, we set to work creating an improved design for the best weighted blanket out there. That’s how the TRUBlanket™ came to be. With your help, we hope to bring the sense of peace and well-being that we’ve experienced to the world.

$20 per blanket to the continental US!
Does the TRUBlanket get too hot?

Yes, simply withdraw your original order, and make another pledge at the reward level you desire.
Can you ship to Alaska or Hawaii?

<p><strong>Hi Friends! Thanks for visiting!</strong></p>
<p>When I was a graduate student in public health five years ago, my friend and I had an idea. What if there were a simple tool that could improve communication between queer/trans young people and healthcare providers? Two years later, The Q Card: Empowering Queer Youth in Healthcare was born. Three years after that, 125,000 Q Cards have made their way into the hands of queer/trans youth, and the adults who care for and about them.</p>
<p>With your help, we can ensure the future sustainability of the program by investing in the necessary systems and supports now. What does that mean? Your gift helps ensure that queer/trans youth have the tools to advocate for themselves in healthcare, and providers have the tools they need to provide sensitive and welcoming care. That is a BIG deal. That is how we change the world.</p>
<p><strong>Where will your gift go?</strong></p>
<p>I’m hoping to raise $10,000 to ensure the sustainability of the project. Here’s what that means:</p>
<ul>
<li>Printing- 50,000 new Q Cards in English/Spanish/Vietnamese</li>
<li>Shipping- no order will ever be rejected if you can’t pay for shipping</li>
<li>Web development- building a new secure ordering system and online donations page</li>
<li>Graphic design- exciting new tools to help folks engage with Q Card Project</li>
<li>Legal fees and contractors- for building a partnership with a 501c3</li>
<li>Rewards- trust me, you gotta see these!<ul>
<li>Do you need a <u><strong>Q CARD BOW TIE</strong></u>? (Spoiler alert: YES!)</li>
<li>How about a waterproof sticker for your car/bike/waterbottle/computer?</li>
<li>Or a rainbow shout-out on social media?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If we do not meet the goal, any collected funds will go to printing and shipping first, then web development. If we EXCEED our goal, I’ll keep printing more Q Cards and making website updates!</p>
<p><strong>Why Q Card matters</strong></p>
<p>Decades of research shows health disparities related to lack of access to quality, sensitive care for LGBTQ communities. Cultural homophobia, stigma, and intersecting oppressions affect our physical, mental, emotional, and social health. By empowering queer/trans young people to become active participants in their health, Q Card is helping to improve their health and engagement with healthcare systems. Youth love that Q Cards are discreet, user-friendly, and simple. Providers love that Q Cards help start conversations, and allow youth to take the lead in talking about their lives.</p>
<p>A nurse practitioner told me last week about a clinic visit with a shy 19 year-old. When she entered the room and asked about the reason for the visit, that patient handed over a Q Card. “I was so delighted when they gave it to me! It totally changed the tone of the conversation, and they were really excited that I was prepared to talk openly about gender and sexuality.”</p>
<p>The Q Card is already making a difference; we need your help to continue this important work.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t have the cash? No worries!</strong></p>
<p>Times are hard for a lot of folks, especially our LGBTQ/POC family. If you’re not able to make a financial contribution, I see you, and I hope you’ll consider supporting the project by spreading the word, and telling your friends/family/colleagues/classmates/neighbors/etc. about our work!</p>

</div></div>","This is Carin  Carin is a 100% natural approach to heal your bladder. A set of wearables helps you with the healing process: 1. Exercise app - a personal trainer for your pelvic floor.2. Wearable sensor - shows you how well you're doing!3. Protective underwear - absorbing and washable underwear.    Developed together with over 100 women, Carin helps you heal your bladder naturally. The exercises are fun! Do them anytime and anywhere you want! You can also keep a drink log and be notified about your training. The protective underwear is washable and environmentally friendly.  Benefits                         How does it work?  

What happens?
Strong pelvic floor muscles support the bladder function. The muscles have the shape of a hammock. The hammock spans the space between the pubic bone and tailbone. 
The bladder, pelvic floor muscles and the brain work together. When the bladder is full, the brain sends a signal to the muscles to relax. If the pelvic floor muscles are damaged, for example after pregnancy, they respond too late and a little leak can happen...

 


Natural solution 

By exercising the pelvic floor muscles you heal your bladder function without expensive surgeries or medical treatments. 
Carin helps you to heal the bladder function in a 100% natural way. It only takes fifteen minutes of pelvic floor exercises per day. They can be done where and whenever you want.  

The problem?
 


 

Research has shown 1 in 3 women have their pelvic floor muscles damaged after having children. The effects disrupt daily life and a healthy lifestyle. Some examples:
1.  That awful little trickle comes at the worst moments...2. Leakages during daily activities (cough, laugh, jump, lift)3.  The gym class with jumping jacks you totally avoid. Or running..4.  Feelings of shame and embarrassment.6.  Side effects from pills to stop an overactive bladder.7.  Skin irritation and infections from wearing plastic in your underwear.8. Adult incontinence9. The options? Expensive surgeries or wearing pads forever (and eventually diapers).

Other testimonials “Before Carin I wasn’t aware that my coffee intake would influence the loss. With keeping a drink log, I notice a big difference already in the first weeks of the exercise programme.”

addressing the oceans pollution problems is typically the “trash boats” These
boats drive around harbors and marinas scooping up rubbish with nets built into

good, they are not very effective according to the marinas that operate them says Caterina Amengual, General Director of the environment for the Balearic

Turton and Pete Ceglinski, supported by a seed investment by Australian marine
technology development company Shark Mitigation Systems Pty Ltd (SMS). SMS has
technology partnerships with Google and Australian telecommunications company
Optus, and is on a pathway to IPO listing on the Australian Stock Exchange.</span><br/>

<div>
<span style=""font-family: Arial;"">Seabin Pty Ltd Director Andrew Turton is an
Australian boat builder, sailor and surfer who conceived the Seabin concept
after numerous sailing trips around the world and witnessing the amount of
pollution that amasses in the marinas.</span>

challenges</span></h1>
<span style=""font-family: Arial;""><div><span style=""font-family: Arial;""><br/></span></div>We have spent a long time
perfecting<span>  </span>and developing the Seabin
protoype and have minimalized a lot of risks through hard work and dedication.
However we also understand there will be design and material modifications in
our quest of producing the most sustainable product we can afford with our
budget. We have given ourselves a realistic delivery date being mid to late
2016 to begin shipping. If this project goes big than the risk is maybe we will
be slightly later as we may need to upgrade our </span><span style=""font-family: Arial;"">production line to handle the orders.</span>
</div>
<div><span style=""font-family: Arial;"">We aim to be completely
honest of where we are with the project, we feel we owe it to our supporters.
If we suffer a set back we will let you know, maybe one of our supporters has
the solution!</span></div>
<div><span style=""font-family: Arial;"">Our biggest challenge will
be if this project goes through the roof with high orders placed then we need to turn to more sustainable methods of producing the Seabins. We have contingency
plans and designs in place if this happens (fingers crossed)</span></div>

</h1>
<p><span style=""font-family: Arial;""> </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: Arial;"">We have a great facility set
up at “The Sea” where we make nearly everything in house ourselves. But for the
first run of the Seabins we will need to outsource some components and already have
suppliers here in Europe on standby to start producing when we give them the
green light. We will then assemble everything local.</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-family: Arial;""> </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: Arial;"">We aim to start shipping mid
to late 2016. If we can ship beforehand even better, but we want to be
realistic. We anticipate a month or so of tweaking and refinement of the final
product. We want to be sure you have the perfect product.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: Arial;"">To reach our goal we anticipate
we need to supply 50 Seabins. We feel this is also a realistic goal in this
time frame. Again, if the project hits the big time then we need to step up the
manufacturing and may take a little longer. But be rest assured that fulfilling
our supporters are our first priority</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: Arial;""> </span><span style=""font-family: Arial;"">For the other perks, it will
be shipped out quickly. No dramas there.</span></p>

A simple solution to our oceans pollution
We are excited to introduce
our new invention helping to solve, educate and prevent our oceans pollution
problems.
The Seabin is a revolution
in ocean cleaning technology. It will help create cleaner oceans with healthier
marine life. The Seabin project is helping create a better way of life for
everyone and every living thing.
Join us in helping create a
better world.
 Andrew Turton & Pete
Ceglinski – Founders of the Seabin project

How can you guys clean our oceans one marina at a time?



By starting close to the source of the problem in a controlled environment. 


The marinas, ports and yacht clubs are the perfect place to
start helping clean our oceans. There are no huge open ocean swells or storms
inside the marinas, its a relatively controlled environment. The wind and
currents are constantly moving the floating debris around in our oceans and in
every port, marina or yacht club there is always some pollution heavy areas
based on the predominant wind and current directions.
By working with these  marinas, ports and yacht clubs we can
locate the seabin in the perfect place  and mother nature brings us the rubbish
to catch it. Sure we cant catch everything right now but its a really
positive start.  It’s a big mission, but it can be done.
In fact, we’re doing it right now.





Heading down the dock to install the Seabin.


Existing solutions to the
ocean pollution problem.
 
The existing solutions
addressing the oceans pollution problems is typically the “trash boats” These
boats drive around harbors and marinas scooping up rubbish with nets built into
them. They are very expensive to run and maintain and while they do a lot of
good, they are not very effective according to the marinas that operate them says Caterina Amengual, General Director of the environment for the Balearic
islands, Spain.

Marina workers walk around
with nets scooping the rubbish out of the corners where it all converges. Again
while these guys they are doing a great job, they just cannot keep up with the
pollution says Eli Dana, General Manager of Newport Shipyard, Rhode Island.
Bigger scale ocean clean up
concepts are also happening. The main one is by Boyan Slats with “The Ocean
Clean Up”. But at this moment in time its just a concept, but a great one!  
 


Why is the Seabin better?
 



·     
Because its here
now


·     
It’s a solution


·     
It’s a
prevention


·     
Its educative


·     
It works


·     
Its low cost


·     
Its low
maintenance


·     
Its very
effective


·     
It works 24/7


 
The Seabin isn’t big or
bulky and can fit into the problem corners of marinas without being obtrusive or taking up dock space for boats.
The waste in the Seabin is collected easily and disposed of responsibly in the
already establish waste disposal system of the marina.
We also have the option to fit an oil/water
separator to the system.  

  
How does Seabin work?   

 

Really technical diagram of how the Seabin works.






The Seabin is located in the
water and is fixed to a floating dock. There is a shore based water pump on the
dock running on shore power.

The water pump creates a
flow of water into the bin bringing with it all floating rubbish and debris.
The rubbish/debris is caught in a natural fibre catch bag and the water is then
sucked out the bottom of the bin and up to the water pump where it is then
pumped back into the marina.



Standard catch for the Seabin

      The Seabin in action down at the dock



Who is the Seabin project
targeted at?
Marinas, ports, harbors, yacht clubs, inland
waterways, rivers, lakes, private pontoons and even motor yachts and super
yachts.  Even boat or business owners that want to have a  Seabin in their local yacht club or marina.


 

Who are you guys?


Seabin Pty Ltd was founded by Australians Andrew
Turton and Pete Ceglinski, supported by a seed investment by Australian marine
technology development company Shark Mitigation Systems Pty Ltd (SMS). SMS has
technology partnerships with Google and Australian telecommunications company
Optus, and is on a pathway to IPO listing on the Australian Stock Exchange.


Seabin Pty Ltd Director Andrew Turton is an
Australian boat builder, sailor and surfer who conceived the Seabin concept
after numerous sailing trips around the world and witnessing the amount of
pollution that amasses in the marinas.


Co-Director Pete Ceglinski is an Australian
industrial designer and surfer. Commencing his industrial design career in
injection-moulded plastic products, in 2004 Pete crossed over to the yachting
industry, catalyzing the collaboration with Andrew on the Seabin venture.


The design and development of the Seabin project is
based in Palma Mallorca, Spain at the design center “The Sea” a factory space
set up for creatives. The Sea has office and meetings space, an events gallery
and a workshop area ideal for the Seabin project.


The Palma Mallorca location is important for the
Seabin project, being the central hub of Europe’s marine industry and also
having quick international access.


The Seabin project is in the final prototype phase
with intensive product testing in the “Real Club Nautic” marina and yacht club
based in Palma Mallorca.


November 2015, Seabin Pty
Ltd is commencing a crowd funding campaign seeking donations to provide additional
seed capital for the commercialisation of Seabin.




                              

                                 
  Possible risks and
challenges
We have spent a long time
perfecting  and developing the Seabin
protoype and have minimalized a lot of risks through hard work and dedication.
However we also understand there will be design and material modifications in
our quest of producing the most sustainable product we can afford with our
budget. We have given ourselves a realistic delivery date being mid to late
2016 to begin shipping. If this project goes big than the risk is maybe we will
be slightly later as we may need to upgrade our production line to handle the orders.

We aim to be completely
honest of where we are with the project, we feel we owe it to our supporters.
If we suffer a set back we will let you know, maybe one of our supporters has
the solution!
Our biggest challenge will
be if this project goes through the roof with high orders placed then we need to turn to more sustainable methods of producing the Seabins. We have contingency
plans and designs in place if this happens (fingers crossed)

 

Manufacturing

 
We have a great facility set
up at “The Sea” where we make nearly everything in house ourselves. But for the
first run of the Seabins we will need to outsource some components and already have
suppliers here in Europe on standby to start producing when we give them the
green light. We will then assemble everything local.
 

Fulfillment
 
We aim to start shipping mid
to late 2016. If we can ship beforehand even better, but we want to be
realistic. We anticipate a month or so of tweaking and refinement of the final
product. We want to be sure you have the perfect product.
To reach our goal we anticipate
we need to supply 50 Seabins. We feel this is also a realistic goal in this
time frame. Again, if the project hits the big time then we need to step up the
manufacturing and may take a little longer. But be rest assured that fulfilling
our supporters are our first priority
 For the other perks, it will
be shipped out quickly. No dramas there.




The Sea. Our R&D center for the Seabin project
 

Seabin development
 
We have spent a lot of time,
energy and money developing the prototype to the best we possibly could.
However there is always room for improvements and modifications.
We want to build the Seabins
in the most sustainable and responsible way we can afford and to reduce our
carbon footprint as much as possible.
Put short, the more money we
can raise the better we can build the Seabins and the more efficient they will
be.
Imagine building seabins
from recycling our own captured plastics and materials to build more Seabins.
Now that would be something!
Something even bigger would
be a world where we don’t need the Seabins.





The Ocean Ambassador perk.
EXCLUSIVE CAMPAIGN PRICE OFFER NOT AVAILABLE OUTSIDE OF INDIEGOGO. 
Be a true innovator for your marina or yacht club. Pre order your Seabins today. Seabin technology will put you ahead of the rest for the problem of ocean plastics and pollution in your marina. Anyone can purchase a Seabin for their local marina or yacht club or water way of their choice. The Seabins work with floating docks or pontoons only at this stage.


Help us reach our goal and we will begin production early. The moment we hit our goal we will give the green light on tooling! The earlier we get there, the earlier you get the Seabins!
We understand that the
Seabin offer is not for everyone.
So we have some other great options for people that want to get behind the Seabin project and make it a
reality.
We have targeted the ""Ocean Ambassador"" perk to marinas, yacht clubs , harbors, lakes, canals, private pontoons and
rivers. Also for yacht, motor boat or even business owners that would like to
donate Seabins to their local marina or yacht club.
Any donation is greatly appreciated and the payment system Paypal accepts anything from $1.00 to $50,000.00

Seabin Project FAQs
 
 Q: Can someone pay out the Indiegogo campaign and if so what would
we get?
 A: Yes! We need help! We would arrange an
exclusivity offer and also involve the donator in the testing and development
phase “pre shipping” Say for instance City of Montreal or City of Paris or
London paid out our crowd funding campaign we would offer them option of  “World first City to install Seabins”, And
also the publicity of being involved in testing and development phase.
This option is open to Marinas, Ports and yacht
clubs also. 
Also eternal thanks from Seabin project!



Q: Who buys these Seabins?
A: The Seabins are not for the everyday person.
Marinas ports and yacht clubs are the target market. They will purchase and
maintain the Seabins, providing a service that benefits the everyday people,
oceans and sealife by removing trash from our oceans and waterways.  
 
 Q: How do Seabins work in tidal areas?
 A: Seabins at present are designed for floating
docks and pontoons.
 Q. How are the pumps run? Do you have any other plans to power
them?
 A. The pumps are currently electric, costing
around $20 a month to run. We are looking into alternative eco friendlier power
sources for the near future!
 Q: When are the Seabins available?
 A: Seabins will be available for shipping late
2016
 Q. What are your plans for the future? Bigger ones?
 A. The possibilities of what we can do if we
get some smarter brains involved are endless! This is just the beginning!
Q: What do the Seabins cost and how do we get one?
 A: The Seabins are available as a pre order
through Indiegogo only. The Indiegogo price is USD$3,825.00 for a unit. Details
through the link above.
 Q: Do any fish get sucked into the Seabins? What about smaller
marine life?
 A: We have never caught a fish or marine animal
in 4 years of testing Seabins. We also have a meeting with a marine Biologist
on the 22nd Dec to start a study into the microscopic marine life.
Q: I don’t have any money to donate, how can I help?
A: Don’t worry! Your amazing anyways and thanks for even contacting us. We need
help to share this project around with any media we can. Social medias   like facebook, instagram, twitter, websites,
bloggers. Also with newspapers, magazines, tv, radio and journalists. Also
friends and family!

“Yogev Mission”
August 23rd; An infant named Yogev, was born in Thailand on week 24, weighing 650g after a surrogacy pregnancy. Immediately after delivery he was rushed to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) while on a breathing tube and in need of intense medical support to survive.
He is still with dad Oded in Bangkok, Thailand as need hospital. He's with only one of his parents. Flying Yogev to unite with his family overseas: Dad Itamar and sister Lia that still didn't see him is a mission now. 
The constitutional issues with same-sex marriage in Israel  generated lots of unexpected expenses to preterm surrogate born baby. Starting with the fact the pregnancy couldn't have happen at home country and more. 



What We Need & What You Get


Yogev's weekly hospitalization cost is $6,000, to be covered by his parents, family member and friends through fundraising.

Yogev is anticipated to spend a few more weeks in the NICU, until he is able to make the flight home to Israel.
Yogev’s parents are Oded Schorr, member of moshav Orot, near Qiryat Malachi, an ER nurse at the Kaplan Medical Center in Rehovot, and Itamar Wolf, a former member of ‘kibutz’ Mishmar Ha’Emek, who works for Intel in Qiryat Gat. Both dads are currently residents of ‘moshav’ Orot, where they continue Oded’s agricultural farm heritage.Oded and Itamar conceived their son Yogev through a surrogacy process in Thailand.
Oded has been with Yogev in Bangkok for the past 2 months, while Itamar returned back home to Israel to take care of their 10 months old daughter Lia, which was also conceived through surrogacy in Thailand. Itamar returned home to help support the family financially, as well as to be involved in the fabulous support, provided by the doctors, nurses and staff at the Kaplan Medical Center.
Our aim is to transfer Yogev to the NICU at the Kaplan Medical Center, ni order to get him the best medical care possible. This would also allow him to profit from his family’s reunion with dad Itamar and sister Lia.
Oded’s parents, the Schorrs, are a typical ‘moshav’ family, lacking any special financial means. As holocaust survivors, they are by no means a large family, to say the least.
To date, Yogev’s medical expenses have exceeded $40,000.
Yogev has reached 1,500 kg, and has started breathing on his own with the aid of oxygen, while staying in an incubator.
In accordance with Dr. Orna Fleidle, Head of the NICU at the Kaplan Medical Center, Yogev will be able to be flown back home soon.
The mission to fly an infant requires a nurse and a doctor, as well as specialized equipment which include a portable incubator, CPR equipment, a heart/lung monitor, oxygen etc.
For this special and expensive flight rescue mission, a doctor and nurse have been donated by the Kaplan Medical Center. both of which are NICU trained. Both the doctor and the nurse have volunteered their time for this mission, and are doing it free of charge.
Having said that, this flight mission, flying baby Yogev to Israel, will incur expensive costs, estimated at $27,000!!!
Friends of the family have donated $4000, a sum that managed to cover barely 4 days of hospital costs, out of the 2 months stay so far.
Hence, we, family and friends, decided to open a fundraising mission, which is called for due to these unique medical and urgent circumstances, and the Schorr-Wolf financial situation. The family is unable to incur this financial burdon.
We turn to each and every one of you, with a special personal plea.
Please help us cover the Thai hospital fees, and flying our baby Yogev home, so he may get the needed medical care in Israel, and to unite with his loving family.
Any donation will be received with much appreciation and would assist us in achieving our goal.
We would like to thank you in advance and from the bottom of our hearts, for your willingness to help.
The Schorr-Wolf family and friends.

Its three powerful motors create amazing sensations, ranging from a lovely low
frequency rumble to patterns that move up and down the shaft. It is USB rechargeable,
and its built in buttons make it easy to control vibration patterns and
intensities.</p>
<p>You can customize the Mod by downloading apps from our
website or by connecting plug-and-play controllers that sync it with your
partner's heartbeat, connect it to your smartphone, or anything else you can
think of.</p>
<p>We'll provide online tools that make it easy to design your
own vibration patterns, or if you're so inclined, you can write your own
programs that completely change how the Mod behaves using our well documented
API. </p>
<p>If you've ever had an idea for a cool sex toy or if you want
a vibrator that you can change to match your mood, the Mod is the vibe for you.</p><p></p>
<h2>The Vibrator</h2>
<p>As a vibrator, the Mod can compete with some of the most popular toys on the market. </p>

Your Mod will come with a Wii Nunchuck standard to give you some fun ways to directly control the vibration motors. </p><p style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(42, 42, 42); letter-spacing: normal;""></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/JGqOXRGAPpQ"" style=""font-weight: bold;"" width=""560""></iframe></div><p></p><p style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(42, 42, 42); letter-spacing: normal;"">Here are just a few of the other things we’ve already built to control the Mod:</p><ul>
<li><p style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;""><b>Integrated Button </b>- The Mod has a mode button on the handle that you can use to change patterns, change vibration intensity, or trigger individual motors. Instructions on our website make it easy to change the button behavior.</p></li>
<li><p style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;""><b>Nunchuck</b> - A standard, simple, and powerful control for the toy. The joystick can manipulate power and pulsing patterns. Shaking the nunchuck's accelerometer can modulate the frequency of the vibrations. To fulfill one major request from Beta testers, we also programmed the ""C"" button as an easy ""kill switch"" to shut the toy off right when you come!</p></li>
<li><p style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;""><b>Video chat</b> - We process the image coming from a webcam. The more movement in the image, the more intense the Mod’s response.</p></li>
<li><p style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;""><b>Capacitive Touch Sensing</b> - Quickly and easily turn most objects in the world into touch-sensitive interfaces for pleasure (ever heard of a <a href=""http://www.makeymakey.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=' target=""_blank""'>Makey-Makey</a>? It's like that!). Trigger your partner's toy by sucking on a banana, or spanking them with a spatula. Connect to a body piercing and turn your partner's whole body into a touchable dildo controller.

<h3></h3><h3>Materials</h3>
<p>We use 100% body-safe platinum cure silicone for the Mod. Since we are committed to open-source, we’ll always give you as much information as possible so that you can verify the properties of all the materials we use. We currently use Smooth-On’s <a href=""http://www.smooth-on.com/Silicone-Rubber-an/c2_1115_1134/index.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Sorta Clear</a> and <a href=""http://www.smooth-on.com/Silicone-Rubber-an/c2_1115_1129/index.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Dragon Skin</a> silicones to make our Mods and will require all of our manufacturing partners to be transparent about their materials.</p>
<h3>Battery</h3>
<p>The Mod comes with an 875 mAh battery and is recharged with a USB micro cable (same as your Android phone). Just connect it to a computer or a phone charger. Battery life will depend on your particular setup (power draw of any connected accessories, vibration pattern and intensity), but should last several hours of ""typical"" use.</p><h3>Donations - Free Dildos!</h3><p>For every 100 Mods we sell, we will give 1 to a sex-friendly public hackerspace, non-profit, or academic organization. If you would like to be on our list for potential donations please contact us at info@comingle.io.<br/>

<h2>Dilduino Platform and OSSex Library</h2>
<p>The Mod is controlled by a custom, Arduino-based microcontroller platform called the Dilduino. Since it’s just an Arduino, you can quickly reprogram it using the standard USB micro port. You can also hook-up any sensor to the “Hacker Port” with a normal USB cable.</p>
<h3>Dilduino</h3>
<p><img alt=""Dilduino.png"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/M-ov_h5ZxlSyNRvancJoqfqifh7FTRBHChaVADoWgKtRP54L9qXrBVtOlRhB4XPZ9PXbCECYnef2L3sE6gIIKB2CzNQVbJcCSIThF0vRFHfrPZ2FL_VNaGjQnsTAPvxlAw"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The Dilduino is a great step forward for small Arduino derivatives. It has many built-in features that are often lacking in many microcontrollers designed for embedded devices:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><b>On-board battery charging</b> - A battery charging circuit makes it easy to connect a Li-ion battery and recharge it over USB.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Integrated Motor driver</b> - The basic output pins on an Arduino are limited to 40 mA of current, which is not nearly enough for really powerful motors. Typically, you would have to connect an external motor-driver circuit to deliver the full power to your vibes, but we built these features directly into the board. Now you can connect up to 500mA per motor channel. </p></li>
<li><p><b>I2C, Analog Inputs, PWM output, and Serial I/O</b> - Our “Hacker Port” is the quickest, most flexible way to incorporate a variety of peripherals in your project. One standard USB port provides regulated 3.3V power and software-switchable pins for Analog, <span style=""background-color: initial;"">I2C/Two-Wire, or Serial sensors. It also features two PWM output channels in case you want to attach additional motors or lights.</span></p></li>
</ul><h2>The OSSex Library</h2>
<p>The OSSex Arduino library is software to make it easy to reprogram and experiment with your Mod. As far as we know, it's the only freely-available haptic feedback library for Arduino, and we can't wait to flesh it out even more. <a href=""https://github.com/Comingle"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">It’s available now on our Github site.</a> It’s under continuous development, and we welcome anyone to get in touch with us about contributing to it. It currently has several awesome features:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><b>Easy device configuration:</b> tell the software what toy you’re using and it will set up all of your inputs and outputs -- you can read from input 1 and turn on motor 2 without having to know an internal pin-out of the microcontroller. </p></li>
<li><p><b>Built-in functions</b> for running vibration patterns, handling button clicks, and reading inputs</p></li>
<li><p><b>Integrated Input Grooming (Coming Soon): </b>  Most sensors are noisy, and getting good responses from them usually requires incorporating smoothing, statistical, and calibration functions. OSSex will have all these functions built-in to automatically present you with well-groomed data.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Serial console</b> to easily tweak how your Mod behaves without having to do any programming. You can build web apps to talk to your toy with Chrome’s Serial API, control it with your phone, or as one of our beta testers put it, <b>find your sweet spot</b>:</p></li>
</ul>
<p style=""background-color: lightcyan; padding: 20px;"">“I was surprised by how much I liked the fast [vibration patterns]. Have you ever watched a cat getting petted by 2+ people at once? It can't figure out how to react, and that's how I felt with those rapid random pulses. I had to make each one last longer than 70 milliseconds (250 ms was my sweet spot), and it felt amazing. Purrrrrrrrr.”</p>
<div>
<h2>Testing and Iterations</h2>
<p>The Mod is a result of over a year of work. Our hyper-fast, iterative prototyping process lets us work out the kinks in our designs and to engineer increasingly refined ways to produce the Mod and our future projects and products.</p>
<p><img alt=""Dildio History first draft - SM.jpg"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/fH057zzsZBr5wGjTiYxAvmieLuj1AtsmcrXWoF0-kBbUFQX4SpPPsNHIN_1PIJSp3A1JzDsNrtxpadC61i3tZ9bvDi_aR8nV5QIfYosk3sqboVRttmQO7vNT1EKGA0ie9Q"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The Mod started as a basic dildo with six tiny embedded vibration motors and a bunch of wires sticking out. Now, it’s a refined form with embedded hardware and buttons for controlling it. We went from clay and foam models to 3D printed models and silicone glove molds. We started off with an off-the-shelf Lilypad Arduino microcontroller, and then designed and produced a custom Arduino-based solution. </p>
<p>We refined not only the technology, but also the user experience. We sent each version out to beta testers for feedback about how it actually felt and what kinds of projects they’d like to make with it. We incorporated this feedback into subsequent designs and now we have something that we’re confident you’ll enjoy hacking and using.</p>

<p>By funding this campaign at any level, you’re also supporting Comingle. Comingle is more than just an open-source sex toy company. We are working to create a sex-positive community of hackers and techno-sex enthusiasts. We support the growth of this community through the principles of open-source, which enable us to easily and quickly innovate in the areas of<b> stimulation</b>, <b>interaction</b>, and <b>doing it yourself</b>.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1124021/files/20141230221813-Comingle-Icons-small.png?1420006693"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h2>Open-source Sex Tech</h2>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Sex and DIY have always gone hand-in-hand. We want to maintain that relationship as technology begins to play a greater role in the bedroom. The <a href=""http://www.oshwa.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">open-source software and hardware movements</a> have provided excellent examples of how to make great, accessible, and customizable programs and products that encourage exploration. By applying the principles and practices of open-source to sex tech, we can encourage hackers to explore sexuality and people interested in sexuality to explore technology. We enact the principles of open-source in three main ways:</span><br/></p><p></p>
<ul>
<li><p><b>Documentation </b>- We don’t just provide circuit diagrams and source code. We go out of our way to clearly document, with photos and instructions, our production processes, design specifications, tips and tricks, and even our materials and suppliers. We want to make sure that everyone has all the information needed to make one of our products.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Access </b>- A key issue in the typical open-source and the DIY tech community is that it’s only accessible to relatively wealthy and well-educated people. We build and document projects that don’t require tons of space, tools, materials, prior knowledge, or start-up capital to do. We know that some of our projects are out of reach for lots of people and we look for workarounds to decrease the barriers to entry for DIY sex-tech.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Community Engagement</b> - It’s not enough just to post a bunch of information if it’s not easy or useful for the community to understand. We conduct workshops which use our projects to teach software, hardware, and sex-positive ideals. We are also constructing an online space for the community to share and find information about projects, ideas, and sex-tech in general.</p></li>
</ul>
<p> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1124015/files/20141230221248-OSSW-Logo_Small_.png?1420006368"" src="""" style=""letter-spacing: 0px; width: 178px; height: 210px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;""/><br/>
</p><h2>A Resource for the Sex Hacker Community</h2>
<p>We see Comingle as a resource for the sex-tech community. We will sell components, kits, and complete products that make it easy for hackers of all levels to build the sex tech of their dreams. We’ll also host forums, encourage dialog, and publish instructions from our community. We want to give like-minded people a place to go for sex hacking info and discussion. Finally, we’ll host workshops, hackathons and parties to bring sex-tech to people who might not encounter otherwise.</p><h2 style=""color: rgb(42, 42, 42);"">Challenges</h2><ul>
<li><p style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;""><b>Open-source</b> - Remaining open-source in a global supply chain will be complicated. Some suppliers want secrecy, and knock-offs are even easier for other people to make. We’ll do our best to find sympathetic suppliers and protect our brand with a trademark while keeping all the information free. Then, you'll at least know that when you buy something that is made by Comingle, we’ll stand behind it with a guarantee of quality.</p></li>
<li><p style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;""><b>Manufacturing</b> - Our anticipated order quantities are in between the number we can make ourselves and the minimum order quantities required by larger manufacturers. Also some of our design decisions may pose challenges for medium-scale manufacturers that we intend to work with. Refining our design so that it has all the features we want while making it easy to manufacture will require us to solve some challenging problems. Our track record with improving our design and manufacturing process shows our ability to solve these problems as we move forward with scaling up manufacturing.</p></li>
<li><p style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;""><b>Community Building</b> - Building a product is one thing. Building a community is something else entirely. We’ll be actively developing our website and continuing to document our projects. We’ll also be stepping up our social media game to engage with people where they already congregate to find out more about what they’d like to see from Comingle. However, a community is only as valuable as its members, so we’ll be doing things to attract contributions from talented people, to jump start our forums and grow our how-tos section.</p></li>

<p>Over the last year, we’ve really refined the device. We still have a lot of work to do to help make the Mod more widely available in order to fulfill our vision of an open-source sex hacker community. We’ll keep you up to date about our progress through the campaign site, our blog and social media accounts, and our mailing list.</p>
<h2>Progress</h2>
<p>We currently have developed a process to produce high-quality Mods ourselves. We use these for beta-testing and in publishing <a href=""https://www.comingle.io/howto"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">How-To articles</a> that instruct and inspire aspiring sex hackers. </p>
<p>This campaign will give us the resources we need to complete the testing and engineering of the Mod for mass production. The contributions will also build out our website to allow contributions and conversations from all the horny hackers out there.</p>
<p>We'll be constantly developing more peripherals and features to illustrate the  Dilduino's potential. These will be documented and made available in our online store. And finally, as Comingle grows, we’ll be able to provide completely new toys, like a re-engineered, body safe <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oxDsEVqnyY"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Electric Eel Digital Condom</a>!</p>

<p>By funding our campaign, you’re supporting the growth of a sex-positive company committed to the principles of open-source. The perks are a great way for us to give you something for your support, and for you to continue to show your support after the campaign ends.</p>
<p>If you choose our featured perk, the Mod, you’ll get a great vibrator, and the more people who do projects with the Mod, the more powerful it becomes. Funds from the Mod will help us grow production and design even more cool sex toys. Other perks, like t-shirts and party packs, help fund the growth of the Comingle community. We want our website to become a place like Instructables, full of user generated content that encourages sexual and technological exploration, and your support will help us build the infrastructure to support that community.</p>
<p>If you don’t want your boss or parents to know that you funded a dildo company, just choose “Don’t display my name on the campaign page” on the Indiegogo pledge page:</p>

<h2>Dilduino and Motors</h2>
<p>If you want to start from the ground up, this is the way to do it. The Dilduino is the Arduino-based platform that runs the Mod. It includes three motor driver circuits and a USB recharging circuit for a LiPo battery, so it’s really easy to embed in your project. You can program it from scratch using Arduino, or use our OSSex library to make selecting inputs and driving the motors easier.</p>
<p>The motors are the most powerful vibrating motors we could find that operate at 3.3 volts. You can really tell the difference between them and some of the tiny vibration motors that you find all over the place.</p>
<p>$60 gets you the fully assembled board and three vibration motors. We’ll leave the motors unattached to give you more flexibility.</p>
<p></p>

<h2>The Mod</h2>
<p>Be one of the first to own this great vibrator and get a head start exploring your own techno-sexual fantasies. You get all the features of a great vibrator: 3 powerful motors in a firm yet bendy shaft, 100% body safe silicone, USB recharging, and lots of great patterns that you can control using the built in buttons.</p>
<p>Every Mod purchased through this campaign comes with a Nunchuck controller. We have made it plug-and-play for you, and it's a great way to directly control each motor and manipulate patterns while they run. It will also include a USB micro cable for charging and reprograming.</p>
<p>Select this perk if you want to have a good time as soon as possible, and you’ll be ready for the release of our plug-and-play accessories for things like heartbeat detection and music syncing.</p>

<h2>The Mod + Sensor Pack</h2>
<p>If you want to dig a little deeper into attaching sensors and programing your Mod, choose this perk, and you’ll get everything that comes with the Mod (Vibrator, Nunchuck, and USB cable) and a collection of sensors that you can use to control the motors and patterns from your Mod.</p>
<p>Unlike some of the peripherals (like the Wii Nunchuck), the sensors in the pack won’t be directly plug-and-play. You’ll have to build some simple circuits around them and program the Mod to work with them. We’ll have lots of illustrated sample circuits and code on our website, though, to get you started quick.</p>
<p>You’ll get the following components in the Sensor Pack:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Bend Sensor + Resistor</p></li>
<li><p>Pressure Sensor + Resistor</p></li>
<li><p>Capacitive Touch Components</p></li>
<li><p>Microphone</p></li>

<h2>Sexy Workshop</h2>
<p>An important part of Comingle is helping people explore their sexuality through hacking. Workshops are a big part of us accomplishing that mission. For $1800 plus the cost of flights and hotel rooms, we will come to your event, party, or jungle expedition to run a workshop about electronics, coding, and sexuality.</p>
<p>Workshops can be targeted for absolute beginners up to Arduino experts and can be tailored to suit your needs. We’ll sort out the details with you in plenty of time to make it to your event, but we can’t do any workshops before May. Just choose this perk and contribute $1800, and we’ll get the conversation started.</p>

<h2>Sexy Workshop On a Plane</h2>
<p>We’re just as fancy as all those other fancy dildo companies, and to prove it, for the low, low price of $40,000, we’ll host a workshop for you and three of your friends on a private plane. You all get Mods and a bunch of accessories, and you’ll learn how to hack it at 40,000 feet (that works out to just $1.00/foot!). This sounds like a LOT of fun to us, so we’d love it if someone claimed this perk.</p>

<li><p><b>How will you make money if you give away all your designs?</b></p></li>
<p>We will sell components, kits, and sex toys to people who don’t have access to tools, the time, or the desire to make their own dildos from the ground up. For people who do want to make their own vibrators, we’ll have the info available, but for others, the documentation is as much about inspiring new ideas as it is about duplicating our products and projects.</p>
<li><p><b>Will you ship your products discreetly?</b></p></li>
<p>Yes, by default we will ship all products super discreetly in nondescript cardboard boxes.  For people who have a personal relationship with their mail carriers, though, we <i>also</i> provide an indiscreet shipping option.</p>

<li><p><b>What color will the Mod come in?</b></p></li>
<p>As you see in our photos and videos, the Mod could come in a dizzying array of colors. We'll offer the Mod in solid colors and with a metallic finish, and hopefully be able to offer glow in the dark and marbled colors as well. We'll communicate with our backers after the campaign about color options.</p>
<li><p><b>In your videos and How-to articles, I keep seeing different sizes and shapes of dildos? What's going on?</b></p></li>
<p>All the Mods you see in our documentation are prototypes. We made the different shapes to test different forms and to figure out how best to embed electronics in silicone. Here's a rendering of the shape of form of what you'll be getting. It won't have any rough edges, and the ports will have a cover to keep out water and lube.</p>

<li><p><b>What do you mean by Gender-neutral?</b></p></li>
<p>We tried to design this toy to be fun no matter what you have between your legs. It's designed to hit g-spots, prostates, clits, glans, and taints of all sorts.</p>
<li><p><b>What business do three white dudes have making sex toys for ladies?</b><br/></p></li>
<p>First of all, butts. We’ve all got ‘em and our vibes are super good for all of them. Second of all, you’re totally right, we’re privileged. We had the benefit of having the opportunity to and encouragement to pursue education and careers in science and technology, and we’re really grateful for that. Sex is fun for everyone, and we hope that our work can help grow interest in technology, but we’ll always be looking for feedback from people with backgrounds, body types, and identities different from our own.</p>
<p>By leaving the design open and accessible, we encourage you to make the Mod truly yours. We've had beta testers tell us that certain vibration patterns didn't do it for them, and it was no problem for them to change the pattern or remove it completely. </p>
<p>Finally, we understand that different people like different things. We know that one shape of the Mod won't work for everyone. We hope that by having a successful campaign, we can produce the Mod in many different forms and continue to create resources for people wanting to create and modify their own toys.</p>
</ol>
</div></div>","The Mod is a great vibrator. It's made from 100% silicone.
Its three powerful motors create amazing sensations, ranging from a lovely low
frequency rumble to patterns that move up and down the shaft. It is USB rechargeable,
and its built in buttons make it easy to control vibration patterns and
intensities.
You can customize the Mod by downloading apps from our
website or by connecting plug-and-play controllers that sync it with your
partner's heartbeat, connect it to your smartphone, or anything else you can
think of.
We'll provide online tools that make it easy to design your
own vibration patterns, or if you're so inclined, you can write your own
programs that completely change how the Mod behaves using our well documented
API. 
If you've ever had an idea for a cool sex toy or if you want
a vibrator that you can change to match your mood, the Mod is the vibe for you.
The Vibrator
As a vibrator, the Mod can compete with some of the most popular toys on the market. 
Customized Play - No Programming RequiredYou can easily change how your Mod works by just quickly loading different apps onto it from our website. Giving your Mod different superpowers is as easy as that! No programming needed!We’ve already been having tons of fun controlling the Mod in all sorts of sexy ways. Your Mod will come with a Wii Nunchuck standard to give you some fun ways to directly control the vibration motors. Here are just a few of the other things we’ve already built to control the Mod:
Integrated Button - The Mod has a mode button on the handle that you can use to change patterns, change vibration intensity, or trigger individual motors. Instructions on our website make it easy to change the button behavior.
Nunchuck - A standard, simple, and powerful control for the toy. The joystick can manipulate power and pulsing patterns. Shaking the nunchuck's accelerometer can modulate the frequency of the vibrations. To fulfill one major request from Beta testers, we also programmed the ""C"" button as an easy ""kill switch"" to shut the toy off right when you come!
Video chat - We process the image coming from a webcam. The more movement in the image, the more intense the Mod’s response.
Capacitive Touch Sensing - Quickly and easily turn most objects in the world into touch-sensitive interfaces for pleasure (ever heard of a Makey-Makey? It's like that!). Trigger your partner's toy by sucking on a banana, or spanking them with a spatula. Connect to a body piercing and turn your partner's whole body into a touchable dildo controller. Many objects can even by used like a Theremin, responding to proximity as well as touch.
Biometrics - A heartbeat sensor lets you feel your partner’s arousal in the throbbing toy. This one is a real favorite — it's super cool to feel the rhythm increase with your partner's excitement.
Web - Make interfaces directly within a web browser. Great for cyber sex, or giving web-geeks a quick way to control their toys!
Soft circuits - A soft stroke sensor that triggers vibrations based on touch. Could be really cool embedded in the tail of a fur suit!
We plan to offer a variety of easy-to-use accessories that plug directly in to the Mod so you won't need electronics skills or supplies to play with fun sensors. What will you build?

Motors
Patterns - Three motors can simulate movement; provide hi-fidelity, focused stimulation; and create opportunities for other couplings of input and output.
Power and Frequency - Using multiple small motors also gives you control over a broader range of powers and frequencies. Combining the outputs of different motors generates the nice, low-frequency (rumbly) vibrations usually only found in larger devices.

Materials
We use 100% body-safe platinum cure silicone for the Mod. Since we are committed to open-source, we’ll always give you as much information as possible so that you can verify the properties of all the materials we use. We currently use Smooth-On’s Sorta Clear and Dragon Skin silicones to make our Mods and will require all of our manufacturing partners to be transparent about their materials.
Battery
The Mod comes with an 875 mAh battery and is recharged with a USB micro cable (same as your Android phone). Just connect it to a computer or a phone charger. Battery life will depend on your particular setup (power draw of any connected accessories, vibration pattern and intensity), but should last several hours of ""typical"" use.Donations - Free Dildos!For every 100 Mods we sell, we will give 1 to a sex-friendly public hackerspace, non-profit, or academic organization. If you would like to be on our list for potential donations please contact us at info@comingle.io.


Dilduino Platform and OSSex Library
The Mod is controlled by a custom, Arduino-based microcontroller platform called the Dilduino. Since it’s just an Arduino, you can quickly reprogram it using the standard USB micro port. You can also hook-up any sensor to the “Hacker Port” with a normal USB cable.
Dilduino

The Dilduino is a great step forward for small Arduino derivatives. It has many built-in features that are often lacking in many microcontrollers designed for embedded devices:

On-board battery charging - A battery charging circuit makes it easy to connect a Li-ion battery and recharge it over USB.
Integrated Motor driver - The basic output pins on an Arduino are limited to 40 mA of current, which is not nearly enough for really powerful motors. Typically, you would have to connect an external motor-driver circuit to deliver the full power to your vibes, but we built these features directly into the board. Now you can connect up to 500mA per motor channel. 
I2C, Analog Inputs, PWM output, and Serial I/O - Our “Hacker Port” is the quickest, most flexible way to incorporate a variety of peripherals in your project. One standard USB port provides regulated 3.3V power and software-switchable pins for Analog, I2C/Two-Wire, or Serial sensors. It also features two PWM output channels in case you want to attach additional motors or lights.
The OSSex Library
The OSSex Arduino library is software to make it easy to reprogram and experiment with your Mod. As far as we know, it's the only freely-available haptic feedback library for Arduino, and we can't wait to flesh it out even more. It’s available now on our Github site. It’s under continuous development, and we welcome anyone to get in touch with us about contributing to it. It currently has several awesome features:

Easy device configuration: tell the software what toy you’re using and it will set up all of your inputs and outputs -- you can read from input 1 and turn on motor 2 without having to know an internal pin-out of the microcontroller. 
Built-in functions for running vibration patterns, handling button clicks, and reading inputs
Integrated Input Grooming (Coming Soon):   Most sensors are noisy, and getting good responses from them usually requires incorporating smoothing, statistical, and calibration functions. OSSex will have all these functions built-in to automatically present you with well-groomed data.
Serial console to easily tweak how your Mod behaves without having to do any programming. You can build web apps to talk to your toy with Chrome’s Serial API, control it with your phone, or as one of our beta testers put it, find your sweet spot:

“I was surprised by how much I liked the fast [vibration patterns]. Have you ever watched a cat getting petted by 2+ people at once? It can't figure out how to react, and that's how I felt with those rapid random pulses. I had to make each one last longer than 70 milliseconds (250 ms was my sweet spot), and it felt amazing. Purrrrrrrrr.”

Testing and Iterations
The Mod is a result of over a year of work. Our hyper-fast, iterative prototyping process lets us work out the kinks in our designs and to engineer increasingly refined ways to produce the Mod and our future projects and products.

The Mod started as a basic dildo with six tiny embedded vibration motors and a bunch of wires sticking out. Now, it’s a refined form with embedded hardware and buttons for controlling it. We went from clay and foam models to 3D printed models and silicone glove molds. We started off with an off-the-shelf Lilypad Arduino microcontroller, and then designed and produced a custom Arduino-based solution. 
We refined not only the technology, but also the user experience. We sent each version out to beta testers for feedback about how it actually felt and what kinds of projects they’d like to make with it. We incorporated this feedback into subsequent designs and now we have something that we’re confident you’ll enjoy hacking and using.

By funding this campaign at any level, you’re also supporting Comingle. Comingle is more than just an open-source sex toy company. We are working to create a sex-positive community of hackers and techno-sex enthusiasts. We support the growth of this community through the principles of open-source, which enable us to easily and quickly innovate in the areas of stimulation, interaction, and doing it yourself.
Open-source Sex Tech
Sex and DIY have always gone hand-in-hand. We want to maintain that relationship as technology begins to play a greater role in the bedroom. The open-source software and hardware movements have provided excellent examples of how to make great, accessible, and customizable programs and products that encourage exploration. By applying the principles and practices of open-source to sex tech, we can encourage hackers to explore sexuality and people interested in sexuality to explore technology. We enact the principles of open-source in three main ways:

Documentation - We don’t just provide circuit diagrams and source code. We go out of our way to clearly document, with photos and instructions, our production processes, design specifications, tips and tricks, and even our materials and suppliers. We want to make sure that everyone has all the information needed to make one of our products.
Access - A key issue in the typical open-source and the DIY tech community is that it’s only accessible to relatively wealthy and well-educated people. We build and document projects that don’t require tons of space, tools, materials, prior knowledge, or start-up capital to do. We know that some of our projects are out of reach for lots of people and we look for workarounds to decrease the barriers to entry for DIY sex-tech.
Community Engagement - It’s not enough just to post a bunch of information if it’s not easy or useful for the community to understand. We conduct workshops which use our projects to teach software, hardware, and sex-positive ideals. We are also constructing an online space for the community to share and find information about projects, ideas, and sex-tech in general.

 
A Resource for the Sex Hacker Community
We see Comingle as a resource for the sex-tech community. We will sell components, kits, and complete products that make it easy for hackers of all levels to build the sex tech of their dreams. We’ll also host forums, encourage dialog, and publish instructions from our community. We want to give like-minded people a place to go for sex hacking info and discussion. Finally, we’ll host workshops, hackathons and parties to bring sex-tech to people who might not encounter otherwise.Challenges
Open-source - Remaining open-source in a global supply chain will be complicated. Some suppliers want secrecy, and knock-offs are even easier for other people to make. We’ll do our best to find sympathetic suppliers and protect our brand with a trademark while keeping all the information free. Then, you'll at least know that when you buy something that is made by Comingle, we’ll stand behind it with a guarantee of quality.
Manufacturing - Our anticipated order quantities are in between the number we can make ourselves and the minimum order quantities required by larger manufacturers. Also some of our design decisions may pose challenges for medium-scale manufacturers that we intend to work with. Refining our design so that it has all the features we want while making it easy to manufacture will require us to solve some challenging problems. Our track record with improving our design and manufacturing process shows our ability to solve these problems as we move forward with scaling up manufacturing.
Community Building - Building a product is one thing. Building a community is something else entirely. We’ll be actively developing our website and continuing to document our projects. We’ll also be stepping up our social media game to engage with people where they already congregate to find out more about what they’d like to see from Comingle. However, a community is only as valuable as its members, so we’ll be doing things to attract contributions from talented people, to jump start our forums and grow our how-tos section.

Andy and Paul founded Comingle after Andy helped a colleague make a vibrator in the Panamanian jungle out of electronic parts he had for his dissertation research (true story). Based on that experience, they realized that sex could be a great way to get people interested in learning electronics and coding, and that their Ph.D. research had given them all the skills they needed to make a great vibrator and to create new ways for people to interact with and experience sex toys in general.
Andrew Quitmeyer 

Andy is a polymath adventurer exploring new ways of interacting with living creatures. At Comingle, he employs his skills in physical computing and animal interaction to develop novel means of engaging with the human animal.
Paul Clifton

Paul's focus at Comingle is on interaction design, combining forms and sensors in ways that let our products respond to your body. His background is in digital media, interaction design and engineering.
Craig Durkin

Craig oversees Comingle’s electronics and software design. His background is in materials science and nanotechnology process development.
Melanie Satchno

Melanie helps craft and document our growing list of how-to articles. She has a background in non-profit administration and sociology.

Over the last year, we’ve really refined the device. We still have a lot of work to do to help make the Mod more widely available in order to fulfill our vision of an open-source sex hacker community. We’ll keep you up to date about our progress through the campaign site, our blog and social media accounts, and our mailing list.
Progress
We currently have developed a process to produce high-quality Mods ourselves. We use these for beta-testing and in publishing How-To articles that instruct and inspire aspiring sex hackers. 
This campaign will give us the resources we need to complete the testing and engineering of the Mod for mass production. The contributions will also build out our website to allow contributions and conversations from all the horny hackers out there.
We'll be constantly developing more peripherals and features to illustrate the  Dilduino's potential. These will be documented and made available in our online store. And finally, as Comingle grows, we’ll be able to provide completely new toys, like a re-engineered, body safe Electric Eel Digital Condom!
Timeline
After a year and a half of design and prototyping we are ready to launch! We'll have all your dildos ready to ship by July at the latest! By August of this year, people should be having lots of fun!



By funding our campaign, you’re supporting the growth of a sex-positive company committed to the principles of open-source. The perks are a great way for us to give you something for your support, and for you to continue to show your support after the campaign ends.
If you choose our featured perk, the Mod, you’ll get a great vibrator, and the more people who do projects with the Mod, the more powerful it becomes. Funds from the Mod will help us grow production and design even more cool sex toys. Other perks, like t-shirts and party packs, help fund the growth of the Comingle community. We want our website to become a place like Instructables, full of user generated content that encourages sexual and technological exploration, and your support will help us build the infrastructure to support that community.
If you don’t want your boss or parents to know that you funded a dildo company, just choose “Don’t display my name on the campaign page” on the Indiegogo pledge page:

Support Comingle
If you just want to see Comingle grow, you can choose this perk and enter any amount on the pledge page. It costs us about $200 to post a new How-to article, and every contribution gets us closer to our goal.
Tricky Perk 
Donate $3 or more to support Comingle and you could get to name a vibration pattern in the OSSex library. The trick is that only the last 5 people who choose this perk will get to pick a name, so watch the number of this perk that get claimed and donate again if you have to.
Comingle Zine #1
The Comingle Zine will include exclusive offline content and will feature one well-documented Mod hack, lots of beautiful photos, and one theory article about a topic relevant to open-source sex technology.
(It'll look better than this)



T-shirts
Show your support for techno-sexual exploration by wearing a Comingle shirt like we wear in our videos. For $25 you get a shirt silk-screened with standard ink. For $40 you get a shirt like we wear in the videos, printed with the same silicone we use for the Mod. From the amount of clothes we have ruined pouring silicone, you can trust us that it won't fade in the wash! We’ll follow up with you after the campaign about size and color preferences.



Comingle Party Pack
Want to have a fun sexy party. For $25 we’ll send you some condoms and lube with our logo on them, as well as some stickers and temporary tattoos that you can use to boldly proclaim your support of open-source sex tech.



Adopt a Homeless Dildo
We make lots of dildos to test our molds and colors and sometimes just because we can. If you choose this perk, you get one of these adorable dildos that’s just looking for a nice place to call home. These guys don’t vibrate, but they look really cool. $25 gets you a small dildo. Increase your pledge to $35 if you’d like one of the larger ones. (As with many of our items, some might even glow in the dark!)



Make it Glow
Add $14 to your dildo or other silicone contribution if you want it to GLOW! Add $7 and we'll throw in a UV laser to draw on it!



Dilduino and Motors
If you want to start from the ground up, this is the way to do it. The Dilduino is the Arduino-based platform that runs the Mod. It includes three motor driver circuits and a USB recharging circuit for a LiPo battery, so it’s really easy to embed in your project. You can program it from scratch using Arduino, or use our OSSex library to make selecting inputs and driving the motors easier.
The motors are the most powerful vibrating motors we could find that operate at 3.3 volts. You can really tell the difference between them and some of the tiny vibration motors that you find all over the place.
$60 gets you the fully assembled board and three vibration motors. We’ll leave the motors unattached to give you more flexibility.



Dilduino and Snow Crash Kit
Want to build your own Electronic Hallucinogens? Try out some digital psychedelia with flashing light patterns? It's crazy but fun!
We will send you the dilduino plus all the components necessary to build your own shocking kit. It can also be used as a TENS unit for stimulating muscles. We have full documentation here.



The Mod
Be one of the first to own this great vibrator and get a head start exploring your own techno-sexual fantasies. You get all the features of a great vibrator: 3 powerful motors in a firm yet bendy shaft, 100% body safe silicone, USB recharging, and lots of great patterns that you can control using the built in buttons.
Every Mod purchased through this campaign comes with a Nunchuck controller. We have made it plug-and-play for you, and it's a great way to directly control each motor and manipulate patterns while they run. It will also include a USB micro cable for charging and reprograming.
Select this perk if you want to have a good time as soon as possible, and you’ll be ready for the release of our plug-and-play accessories for things like heartbeat detection and music syncing.



The Mod + Sensor Pack
If you want to dig a little deeper into attaching sensors and programing your Mod, choose this perk, and you’ll get everything that comes with the Mod (Vibrator, Nunchuck, and USB cable) and a collection of sensors that you can use to control the motors and patterns from your Mod.
Unlike some of the peripherals (like the Wii Nunchuck), the sensors in the pack won’t be directly plug-and-play. You’ll have to build some simple circuits around them and program the Mod to work with them. We’ll have lots of illustrated sample circuits and code on our website, though, to get you started quick.
You’ll get the following components in the Sensor Pack:

Bend Sensor + Resistor
Pressure Sensor + Resistor
Capacitive Touch Components
Microphone
Small Breadboard
Conductive Fabric and Conductive Thread
Potentiometer
Jumper Wires



The Mod + Snow Crash
Check out our tutorial on making electrodes that can make you hallucinate crazy patterns of light. You can connect your kit right up to your dildo and have a CRAZY TIME!


Sexy Workshop
An important part of Comingle is helping people explore their sexuality through hacking. Workshops are a big part of us accomplishing that mission. For $1800 plus the cost of flights and hotel rooms, we will come to your event, party, or jungle expedition to run a workshop about electronics, coding, and sexuality.
Workshops can be targeted for absolute beginners up to Arduino experts and can be tailored to suit your needs. We’ll sort out the details with you in plenty of time to make it to your event, but we can’t do any workshops before May. Just choose this perk and contribute $1800, and we’ll get the conversation started.


(Here's a little workshop/talk we had in Good Vibrations in San Francisco)
Sexy Workshop On a Plane
We’re just as fancy as all those other fancy dildo companies, and to prove it, for the low, low price of $40,000, we’ll host a workshop for you and three of your friends on a private plane. You all get Mods and a bunch of accessories, and you’ll learn how to hack it at 40,000 feet (that works out to just $1.00/foot!). This sounds like a LOT of fun to us, so we’d love it if someone claimed this perk.






How will you make money if you give away all your designs?
We will sell components, kits, and sex toys to people who don’t have access to tools, the time, or the desire to make their own dildos from the ground up. For people who do want to make their own vibrators, we’ll have the info available, but for others, the documentation is as much about inspiring new ideas as it is about duplicating our products and projects.
Will you ship your products discreetly?
Yes, by default we will ship all products super discreetly in nondescript cardboard boxes.  For people who have a personal relationship with their mail carriers, though, we also provide an indiscreet shipping option.

What color will the Mod come in?
As you see in our photos and videos, the Mod could come in a dizzying array of colors. We'll offer the Mod in solid colors and with a metallic finish, and hopefully be able to offer glow in the dark and marbled colors as well. We'll communicate with our backers after the campaign about color options.
In your videos and How-to articles, I keep seeing different sizes and shapes of dildos? What's going on?
All the Mods you see in our documentation are prototypes. We made the different shapes to test different forms and to figure out how best to embed electronics in silicone. Here's a rendering of the shape of form of what you'll be getting. It won't have any rough edges, and the ports will have a cover to keep out water and lube.


What do you mean by Gender-neutral?
We tried to design this toy to be fun no matter what you have between your legs. It's designed to hit g-spots, prostates, clits, glans, and taints of all sorts.
What business do three white dudes have making sex toys for ladies?
First of all, butts. We’ve all got ‘em and our vibes are super good for all of them. Second of all, you’re totally right, we’re privileged. We had the benefit of having the opportunity to and encouragement to pursue education and careers in science and technology, and we’re really grateful for that. Sex is fun for everyone, and we hope that our work can help grow interest in technology, but we’ll always be looking for feedback from people with backgrounds, body types, and identities different from our own.
By leaving the design open and accessible, we encourage you to make the Mod truly yours. We've had beta testers tell us that certain vibration patterns didn't do it for them, and it was no problem for them to change the pattern or remove it completely. 
Finally, we understand that different people like different things. We know that one shape of the Mod won't work for everyone. We hope that by having a successful campaign, we can produce the Mod in many different forms and continue to create resources for people wanting to create and modify their own toys.",36.0,6,"3 Campaigns

<p>Despite numerous challenges, Monica was now more driven than ever before to pursue her dream in the fashion industry. She was soon interning for renown Indian fashion designer Manish Arora.

She is therefore determined to make him proud as she now pursues a degree at one of the top fashion institutes in the world. <br/></p>
<p>Bellow is a letter written by Monica:</p>
<p>Dear All,</p>
<p>It's been almost decade since I've been labeled a Victim - a Victim of an acid attack, a Victim of society, a Victim of living life on my own terms.</p>
<p>Upon entering college I had achieved the 2nd highest score for the all-India entry exam at the National Institute of Fashion and Design. The day I learned of my exam score confirmed the fact that I was destined to pursue a career as a creative person. Being in Delhi and learning about fashion was my sole mission at the time. But when I came back home for the summer after my first year at college, a male friend who I had known for several years proposed to me. He wanted me to leave my parents and give up my life and education in the city. I highly objected and thus declined his proposal. His response to my rejection changed my life forever.</p>
<p>My fight against death began after the acid attack. Friends and family were unable to recognize me at the hospital after the incident and it took me an entire year to be finally move independently on a wheelchair. Nine years later at the age of 28 I am still considered abnormal looking within society, but have made it thus far.</p>
<p>I am now counting on the support of each and every one of you to make my dream into a reality. I have lost one major soldier where this battle is concerned - my dear loving father who used to support me in every possible way. But I still have hope that I can raise sufficient funds by my deadline for my tuition and living costs in NYC.</p>

Monica was only 20 years old when her life changed forever. At the time she was a promising straight-A-student pursuing a modelling career in addition to an undergraduate degree from the prestigious National Institution Of Fashion Technology in New Delhi, India.  Monica would go visit her parents for holidays in the city of Lucknow between semesters. It was during one of her trips back home that the unfortunate incident occurred.
“I was driving when a friend called. He got me to roll my window down on the pretense of being nearby and having seen my car.

<p> <u><strong>Short Summary</strong></u></p>
<p>I am a 16 year old high school girl who lives in Orillia,
ON, Canada.  Growing up, I have been
pursuing sports, and now I have my first opportunity to represent Canada on a
World-class level! Cross Country
Mountain Biking has become my passion in the past few years, and I train day in
and day out to be the best racer possible. 
</p>
<p>My goal with this campaign is to raise money that will go
towards my trip to Norway for the World Championships.  With your help, I can fly across the ocean,
face new obstacles, and absolutely kill myself in the toughest race of my life.  This experience will further develop me as an
athlete, and as a possible future Olympian. </p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p><u><strong>What we Need &amp; What you Get</strong></u></p>
<p>Norway is one of the most expensive countries to visit as a
foreigner; everything is more expensive over there! The money raised will go
specifically towards the plane ride there and back, the accommodation in Norway
with Team Canada, the Team Canada support fee, and of course all the food
(&amp; for a skinny girl I eat a LOT). </p>
<p>With all of these expenses added together, the total will
easily be 3 thousand dollars… now that’s a load of cash! Moral and emotional
support is much needed, but that won’t help me step on a plane
Norway-bound.  </p>
<p>All contributions, big and small, will be GREATLY
appreciated… and I have many perks for generous donors! </p>
<p>Even if I don’t reach my entire goal, any donations that I did
receive will still go towards my trip! </p>
<p><u><strong>The Impact</strong></u></p>
<p>Contributions to this campaign will not only help me reach
my personal goals of making a mark on the International sports scene, but will
help Canada be as greatly represented at World Championships and help the sport
of mountain biking grow. </p>
<p>As a first year Junior Expert rider (ages 17 &amp; 18), I
hope to reach top 20 in a field of extremely competitive girls and gain more
experience racing far away. All of my
hard training has been paying off this season as I have won Canadian
Championships, a Canada Cup, and a US Cup race. 
Going into World Championships, I will be the highest-ranked Canadian
Junior female. </p>
<p>Hopefully, I can make Canada proud and have my best race yet
at World Championships. </p>

<p><u><strong>Challenges</strong></u></p>
<p>Naturally, I will face many new challenges in my Norwegian
experience. The first thing that comes
to my mind is trying to master the technical components of the race
course.  This will be my first
world-class race course, and it will be much harder than anything I have ever

<span style=""font-size: 14px;""><span class=""notranlsate"">As happens in life, the most trying and difficult times can bring the most amazing smiles. These are the times that we learn the most about ourselves and what we can accomplish. We discover the full capability of what our limits are and how far we can go to make the impossible happen.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span style=""font-size: 14px;""><span class=""notranlsate"">This amazing family carries these smiles out of love, joy, respect for each other and pure faith. They also carry them from the overwhelming amount of “life” that has happened to them in the past 2 years. </span></span></p>
<span style=""display: none;""> </span>
<p>
<span style=""font-size: 24px;""><b><span style=""display: none;""> </span>Lets go back to the beginning</b></span><b><span style=""display: none;""> </span></b></p>
<span style=""display: none;""> </span>
<p>
<span style=""font-size: 14px;""><span class=""notranlsate"">Around 2 years ago, Michaela was diagnosed with Breast Cancer. After completing the required appointments and check-ups, her recovery plan was established and started. This put her off work, leaving Shawn as the sole income to support the family and all the bills.  Shortly into her chemo, it was discovered that Shawn required surgery to correct a hernia. This happened around the same time that his father required the same surgery. Shawn delayed his surgical procedure until Michaela completed her last chemo session. However, a pathology error was uncovered which directed another year of chemo treatments for Michaela. Within a short time, both Shawn and Michaela were facing unrelenting medical needs that did not allow for either to work full time placing this family in undue financial strain.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span style=""font-size: 14px;""><span class=""notranlsate"">Normally, families have relatives for support and to rely on for additional help.  For Shawn and Michaela, their family was no exception. There were limitations but always support. Shawn’s mom had hip surgery which regrettably yielded an infection that took her away from her family much too soon. One Grandfather had a heart attack and another Grandfather passed away. The emotional strain on Shawn and Michaela was tested, but, also a testament to their marriage and their faith.   </span></span></p>
<p>
<span style=""font-size: 14px;""><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">As time passed for Michaela to continue with her chemo treatments, life happened within their immediate family. The roof on the family home needed repair; the family vehicle needed extensive repair, and during a routine dental check up, one of their daughters was advised she needed oral surgery and braces. With their reduced work schedule, the challenge became the simple things like clothing 3 daughters, feeding a family, paying a mortgage – the added challenge was to get the major items completed as well.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span style=""font-size: 14px;"">Recently, life happened again – in a devastating way. Their youngest daughter attended a doctor’s appointment for a lump that was found on her eye lid. A small surgery to remove it and a test later revealed that it was cancer, the diagnosis - Grade 1 Embryonic Rhabdomyosarcom. At 5 years old, she is undergoing chemo to fight this rare cancer, her hair is falling out and she maintains her beautiful smile.</span></p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i41.tinypic.com/f3i3gn.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><p>
</p><p>
<span style=""font-size: 14px;""><span class=""notranlsate"">When we sit back and look at the events of their lives, this family has been touched with cancer 3 times, 2 hernia surgeries, the death of 2 grandparents, reduced work for recovery and illness, dental surgery and braces, extensive repair on the family home and family vehicle, buying gas to travel out of town to all the appointments, keeping 3 girls fed and clothed and all of the other happenings of life, like birthdays, Christmas and church events, this family has not had a chance to relax and be a family for a really long time.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span style=""font-size: 14px;""><span class=""notranlsate"">We wanted to introduce this amazing family to you, to show you a snapshot of their lives over the past 2 years. We hope that you can see the same thing that we do – they know what is important and they work as hard as they can to maintain it. We ask that you consider helping them, so that they can have more time together. We never know what this world will bring. We ask that you consider this strong, faithful family as a deserving recipient of any potential donation that you will consider. We ask that you help keep their smiles on their faces.</span></span></p>
<p>
				 </p>
<p>
<strong><span style=""font-size: 24px;"">What happens with the donations?</span></strong></p>
<p>
<span class=""notranlsate"">We're not just asking for a random amount of money. If our goal of $7500.00 is met the money will be put to use the following ways:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span class=""notranlsate"">$2000.00 is set aside to keep the family van roadworthy for any trips required to both the local hospital for Dannie's chemo treatments, and to Sick Kids in Toronto.</span>
</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>
<span class=""notranlsate"">With the eldest daughter needing braces the majority of what is left will be used for this procedure.</span>
</li>
</ul><span class=""notranlsate"">If we are unable to obtain our goal, all money will be spent to offset the cost associated with keeping the family van roadworthy. If we manage to exceed our goal, all donations will be used to pay off past debts including roof repairs, and perhaps contribute to an extra special Christmas for the family. </span>
<p>
				 </p>
<p>
<strong><span style=""font-size: 24px;"">What is Rhabdomyosarcoma?</span></strong></p>
<p>
<span class=""notranlsate"">Sarcomas are cancers that develop from connective tissues in the body, such as muscles, fat, bones, membranes that line the joints, or blood vessels. There are many types of sarcomas. Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is a cancer made up of cells that normally develop into skeletal muscles. The body has 3 main types of muscles.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span class=""notranlsate"">Skeletal (voluntary) muscles are muscles that we control to move parts of our body.</span>

As happens in life, the most trying and difficult times can bring the most amazing smiles. These are the times that we learn the most about ourselves and what we can accomplish. We discover the full capability of what our limits are and how far we can go to make the impossible happen.

This amazing family carries these smiles out of love, joy, respect for each other and pure faith. They also carry them from the overwhelming amount of “life” that has happened to them in the past 2 years. 
 

 Lets go back to the beginning 
 

Around 2 years ago, Michaela was diagnosed with Breast Cancer. After completing the required appointments and check-ups, her recovery plan was established and started. This put her off work, leaving Shawn as the sole income to support the family and all the bills.  Shortly into her chemo, it was discovered that Shawn required surgery to correct a hernia. This happened around the same time that his father required the same surgery. Shawn delayed his surgical procedure until Michaela completed her last chemo session. However, a pathology error was uncovered which directed another year of chemo treatments for Michaela. Within a short time, both Shawn and Michaela were facing unrelenting medical needs that did not allow for either to work full time placing this family in undue financial strain.

Normally, families have relatives for support and to rely on for additional help.  For Shawn and Michaela, their family was no exception. There were limitations but always support. Shawn’s mom had hip surgery which regrettably yielded an infection that took her away from her family much too soon. One Grandfather had a heart attack and another Grandfather passed away. The emotional strain on Shawn and Michaela was tested, but, also a testament to their marriage and their faith.   

As time passed for Michaela to continue with her chemo treatments, life happened within their immediate family. The roof on the family home needed repair; the family vehicle needed extensive repair, and during a routine dental check up, one of their daughters was advised she needed oral surgery and braces. With their reduced work schedule, the challenge became the simple things like clothing 3 daughters, feeding a family, paying a mortgage – the added challenge was to get the major items completed as well.

Recently, life happened again – in a devastating way. Their youngest daughter attended a doctor’s appointment for a lump that was found on her eye lid. A small surgery to remove it and a test later revealed that it was cancer, the diagnosis - Grade 1 Embryonic Rhabdomyosarcom. At 5 years old, she is undergoing chemo to fight this rare cancer, her hair is falling out and she maintains her beautiful smile.


When we sit back and look at the events of their lives, this family has been touched with cancer 3 times, 2 hernia surgeries, the death of 2 grandparents, reduced work for recovery and illness, dental surgery and braces, extensive repair on the family home and family vehicle, buying gas to travel out of town to all the appointments, keeping 3 girls fed and clothed and all of the other happenings of life, like birthdays, Christmas and church events, this family has not had a chance to relax and be a family for a really long time.

We wanted to introduce this amazing family to you, to show you a snapshot of their lives over the past 2 years. We hope that you can see the same thing that we do – they know what is important and they work as hard as they can to maintain it. We ask that you consider helping them, so that they can have more time together. We never know what this world will bring. We ask that you consider this strong, faithful family as a deserving recipient of any potential donation that you will consider. We ask that you help keep their smiles on their faces.

				 

What happens with the donations?

We're not just asking for a random amount of money. If our goal of $7500.00 is met the money will be put to use the following ways:


$2000.00 is set aside to keep the family van roadworthy for any trips required to both the local hospital for Dannie's chemo treatments, and to Sick Kids in Toronto.



With the eldest daughter needing braces the majority of what is left will be used for this procedure.

If we are unable to obtain our goal, all money will be spent to offset the cost associated with keeping the family van roadworthy. If we manage to exceed our goal, all donations will be used to pay off past debts including roof repairs, and perhaps contribute to an extra special Christmas for the family. 

				 

What is Rhabdomyosarcoma?

Sarcomas are cancers that develop from connective tissues in the body, such as muscles, fat, bones, membranes that line the joints, or blood vessels. There are many types of sarcomas. Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is a cancer made up of cells that normally develop into skeletal muscles. The body has 3 main types of muscles.


Skeletal (voluntary) muscles are muscles that we control to move parts of our body.


Smooth muscle is the main type of muscle in internal organs (except for the heart). For example, smooth muscles in the intestines push food along as it is digested. We do not control this movement.


Cardiac muscle is the main muscle type in the heart.


About 7 weeks into the development of an embryo, cells called rhabdomyoblasts (which will eventually form skeletal muscles) begin to form. These are the cells that can develop into RMS. Because this is a cancer of embryonal cells, it is much more common in children, although it does sometimes occur in adults.

We think of our skeletal muscles as being mainly in our arms and legs, but these skeletal muscle cancers can start nearly anywhere in the body. Common sites of RMS include:


Head and neck (near the eye, inside the nasal sinuses or throat, or near the spine in the neck)


Urinary and reproductive organs (bladder, prostate gland, or any of the female organs)


Arms and legs


Trunk (chest and abdomen)


RMS can even start in some parts of the body that don’t normally have skeletal muscle

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<div>Hey everyone! My name is Emily, and I am a nursing student at the University of Virginia. I am passionate about healthcare and helping others. This year, I got involved with the Global Medical Brigades. This amazing organization travels to countries all over the world to provide healthcare to under served countries. In late December, I will be traveling to Ghana with a group from the Global Medical Brigades to provide healthcare to some of the small villages within the country. We will be setting up a clinic that will see several hundred people in the few days we are there. Also, we will be making door to door visits within the community to encourage people to ask us questions about healthcare and to learn more about the culture of the villages. For many of these people, this annual clinic is the only way they have access to healthcare. We have the ability to make a huge impact on many people's lives because of this clinic.</div>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<div>I am trying to raise about $1,300 for this trip. This money will help cover the cost of airfare and supplies we need to set up this clinic. Even if I do not reach my fundraising goal, every little bit helps! The more supplies we bring to Ghana, the more people we can help!</div>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>The Global Medical Brigades is an international organization that provides healthcare to many different countries. The University of Virginia's Global Medical Brigades has been making annual trips to Ghana for several years now, and we have partnered with UVA's Global Dental Brigades to set up a joint clinic in country. Providing healthcare to under served areas has a rippling effect of positive changes. For example, we can help prevent diseases, such as HIV and malaria, through public education, vaccination, and medication, all of which will be provided at no cost to the people who come through our clinic. </div>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can not afford to make a monetary contribution at this time, there are other ways to get involved! Consider joining a brigade if you have the time to commit to it! You can find out more about all the different brigades at this website <a href=""http://www.globalbrigades.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.globalbrigades.org/</a>.

This means taking the right dose, at the right time, as many times as necessary. It's hard to keep track of all this information, especially when you’re taking several medications multiple times a day.No one wants to forget their medication, and many people worry about taking their medicine on time. Living with this anxiety all the time is not healthy and may even exacerbate what you’re trying to treat!But with MedHub, your medication organization is fully automated. MedHub will show you what medication to take at what time, and keeps track of each time you take or miss a medication. Meet MedHub⎯the smart medical intake adviser that makes it easy to keep track of your health status and make sure you take your medicine on time.MedHub is very easy to use: just place the pills inside and connect the device to our app on your mobile device to begin receiving reminders.

Carpentry seemed to run thick in his family’s blood. He spent evenings and summers working for his uncles who owned their own businesses. By the time he graduated high school, he had already mastered the skill. He married, and within just a few short years, they had 4 children. Though he worked from sun up to sun down, I can honestly say that I never remember him complaining about having to go to work. It was his passion. If he wasn’t working, he was fishing, hunting, or cooking up something in the kitchen. <br/><br/>He has always been a family man. His best days were those that he could spend with family…not just his immediate family…but Sunday gatherings of family. He was always been a free hand, if you needed help. And, he was always there to listen, if you just needed to vent. His heart was full of love, and do just about anything to show that to you. <br/><br/>In 2000, he was diagnosed with <strong>Diabetes</strong>. He tried to still live a somewhat normal life, but “normalcy” slowly diminished. With the sun being too much for his diabetes-stricken body, he was gradually pushed out of his passion – his job. His work days become shorter and shorter because the sun was just too much for his body. Then, neuropathy started affecting his daily routine as well. He could no longer hold and grasp the tools, and lost his balance because of the numbness in his hands and feet. <br/><br/>Finally, a few years ago, he was rewarded Social Security Disability. He’s had to learn to live on that as an only income…an amount that he could’ve easily made in one week’s worth of pay, if he had still been able to do construction. He’s applied for Medicaid more times than I can count, but keeps getting denied. Why? We really don’t know. He doesn’t have assets totaling much, he isn’t faking the disease, and truly does need more than Medicare. <br/><br/>Since October, we have almost lost him several times. Though Im extremely lucky and happy that he’s alive, my heart still hurts so much for him. He had to have his leg amputated, because of gangrene setting in his bone. Once he was sent home for recovery, a lady came by once a week and fit him for his prosthetic. Every week, he would try it on, and it became a better fit. Finally, he had his last appointment in the office. They called him in, set him down, helped  put on his perfectly fit prosthetic that was made specially for him, and they assisted him as he walked around the office. <br/><br/>Little did he know, that appointment was just a mockery. They took off the prosthetic and told him that in order to take it home, he would first have to pay the balance that Medicare didn’t cover. That balance being almost $7,000.00. When he told them that he didn’t have that kind of money, they informed him that they didn’t allow financing for this either. So, he left…without the prosthetic, with no hope that he'd ever walk again.   <br/><br/>We have tried a several diabetic and prosthetic charities, but have gotten nowhere. This is really the last thing I know to do to reach out for help.

The Ladodeya Elixir contains seven botanical components. The recipe is based on substances extracted from seeds of Siberian nettle.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Nettle is really unique by its properties. Its area of
application is vast: it is used in food products, extracts, creams,
masks. Nettle fiber is used even in production of fabric.
Anything made out of this plant has a healing, preventive or
beautycare effect. </p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Like many other
plants, nettle combines some antipodal properties. For example, its leaves
strengthen and stimulate hair growth, whereas substances
contained in seeds are good for hair exhaustion and
removal. Nettle is the queen of all curative herbs. It
has long been
granted unchallenged recognition across the globe.
This exceptional  plant was known and applied as a remedy yet at
the beginning of our era. Now it is successfully used in
medicine, beauty industry and cooking. Today, nettle is a farming
crop in many countries of Europe, cultivated as a valuable medicinal
plant. There are dozens of varieties of nettle, and each variety is like no
other, each has found its specific application in a
particular area. </p>

<p><br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Our tests of
nettle recipes have proven their accuracy and efficiency. Proper
preparation and right applications guarantee the desired effects of
the Elixir. Those who have used the <span>Ladode</span>ya hair remover, unanimously agree
that it is compounded by the recipe, and the prescriptions do not stretch
the truth. Skin zones treated more than two years ago still remain
clean of hair today. </p>

<br/><p>Крапивы насчитывается десятки сортов и каждый сорт уникален, обладает собственным, ярко выраженным действием в определенной сфере. Как у многих других растений, у крапивы есть области полярного применения, например, листья укрепляют волосы и стимулируют их рост, а вещества находящиеся в семенах направленно действуют на истощение и удаление волос.</p>

Story
Our
ancestors lived in harmony with nature. It gave them everything they
needed for life. There were no beauty parlors and spa centers in taiga, but
having banya and all the wonders of nature at their disposal, our
great-grandmothers looked much better than modern
women. 





Everyone complains nowadays of the fast pace of modern life, polluted environment of big cities, irregular meals, poor sleep and other negative factors that impact health and looks. Moreover, very few of us have inherited the secret methods that used to help senior people to retain youth and beauty, health and strength for long. However,  good news is: the old knowledge is rediscovered and available to you.

A few years ago, on a trip to Siberia,


we
were initiated into the secret of
ancient remedies based on herbs and wild fruit. We
received over a hundred recipes composed of different
herbs, roots, seeds, and fruit. We were taught methods of
application of these nature blessings in everyday life. We
learnt about different approaches to treatment and to prevention of health problems. On top of this
all, we mastered many recipes of youth and
beauty. 


Of the many
secrets that we revived, several were already known to us,
but there were some that we had never heard of. One of such
recipes is the Ladodeya
hair removing Elixir. It takes only one course of treatment to
get rid of unwelcome hair once and for all. 


It has been three
years since we discovered and tested this Elixir. During this period many
women had the lucky chance to ascertain its efficiency, and
all of them were satisfied with the effect! 

And today, it is our honor and pleasure to offer you this magic Elixir!


 
  Now you can get rid of razors and cuts,

laser epilation and hot wax, skin
irritation, wax strips and hard-to-remove, ever-sticking spiny hairs, infinite
application of creams, dryness and damaged skin. 


Never again you
will suffer the endless waste of effort, time and money. Let it all
be the story of the past, now that you have the opportunity to take just a
single course of the Ladodeya
hair remover and forget forever about hair removal and shaving. This
Elixir will now save your money, time, health and beauty. 

You will always look and feel your best!






The Ladodeya Elixir contains seven botanical components. The recipe is based on substances extracted from seeds of Siberian nettle.





Nettle is really unique by its properties. Its area of
application is vast: it is used in food products, extracts, creams,
masks. Nettle fiber is used even in production of fabric.
Anything made out of this plant has a healing, preventive or
beautycare effect. 

Like many other
plants, nettle combines some antipodal properties. For example, its leaves
strengthen and stimulate hair growth, whereas substances
contained in seeds are good for hair exhaustion and
removal. Nettle is the queen of all curative herbs. It
has long been
granted unchallenged recognition across the globe.
This exceptional  plant was known and applied as a remedy yet at
the beginning of our era. Now it is successfully used in
medicine, beauty industry and cooking. Today, nettle is a farming
crop in many countries of Europe, cultivated as a valuable medicinal
plant. There are dozens of varieties of nettle, and each variety is like no
other, each has found its specific application in a
particular area. 






Our tests of
nettle recipes have proven their accuracy and efficiency. Proper
preparation and right applications guarantee the desired effects of
the Elixir. Those who have used the Ladodeya hair remover, unanimously agree
that it is compounded by the recipe, and the prescriptions do not stretch
the truth. Skin zones treated more than two years ago still remain
clean of hair today. 



 There is no magic involved,





but  this  Elixir is destined
by nature to grant us its benefits. 


The Ladodeya hair remover is
easy to prepare, but just like any simple and
ingenious recipe, it has its own nuances and secrets. 

 




The Ladodeya Elixir includes
several components that enhance the nettle properties, and therefore
guarantee a maximum effect: hair is removed once and for all.







Each of us has a bespoken identity by birth, so
our prescription is designed with reference to individuals' distinctive
differences. 







 


The Elixir is adapted to various skin types, thanks to
consideration of specific  properties of ingredients, their
possible effects on the body, as well as the related reactions. 







 Any company engaged in the production of
beauty products can easily identify the composition of Ladodeya, so we do
not conceal it. Moreover, manufacturers undoubtedly have already got
these recipes. But the giants in the beauty industry would
hardly want to waste the opportunity of selling their own
available lines of hair removal products to millions of
women.



It's a huge industry. After epilation, shaving, wax strips, laser treatment your skin requires rehabilitation with skin creams and masks. This endless cycle repeats over and over,  week by week, and month by month.


But we offer you the chance to break through, to break out of this vicious circle. One course of the Ladodeya hair remover is sufficient to get rid of unwelcome hair forever.




How to use:


Apply on your skin after cleaning and steaming once a day. 
Wait for 15 minutes, rinse with running water. 
Complete hair removal achieved in 14 to 20 days.









Additional recommendations for use:


While treating
the bikini area, consider in advance the fact that after treatment nothing can
be changed, including your chosen design. Therefore, we encourage you to think
about it before you start using the Elixir.

Keep out of reach of children.
Do not use on animals.
Store at a temperature between + 4 to +20 C.

<p><br/></p>
<p>Two and a half years ago I found myself feeling incredibly low, lost and unable to do much of anything. I was unable to focus, I found it difficult to stay out of bed for more that a few hours at a time, interact with anyone without feeling anxious, and worst of all I had no idea what was wrong with me. <br/></p>
<p>After visiting my GP a few months later I found out I was suffering from moderate depression. I couldn't believe it. I couldn't have depression. I felt weak somehow..but at the same time I realised that something tangible and real was happening to me...I wasn't just crazy, or lazy or being moody.<br/></p>
<p>From there I decided to work on myself first - I was a young man not ready to share his feelings with other people. So I did my research - I started going on website's that provided a lot of information on depression and how I can face my negative thought patterns to help myself. I looked at apps, videos, documentaries, journals, books, and even went to a few conferences. The content of all of these were admittedly dry and quite boring, but I forced myself to get through this, as I understood the importance of what this information could do for people.</p>
<p>Eventually I started feeling better and able to get out into the full world again. I started talking to a counsellor, I got a job as a Research Assistant and I started playing music again. I still had some horrible lows, but from all that I had learnt I was able to develop an understanding that there was actually a light at the end of the tunnel. I kept having nagging thoughts in the back of my head though - 'How many other people have gone through the same thing as me? How many of them didn't find the right support to help them? How many people desperately need support right now?'</p>
<p>I started doing research in my spare time. I researched for myself all of the best, scientifically-proven methods to help people  --  not only those with depression, but everyone -- to improve their mental well-being. At the same time I researched the prevalence of depression, anxiety and stress. The results were shocking:</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>1/4 of the UK population will experience a mental illness in the course of a year, with depression and anxiety as the most common problems.</p>
<p>The World Health Organisation describes depression as the leading cause of disability in the world.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I began talking to a lot of people - psychiatrists, people with depression, other people with no previous history of mental illness. Wherever I went I found there was a huge demand for an engaging and simple way for people to access, understand, and practise the best ways to improve our mental well-being: our focus, ability to manage stress levels, our mental health, our confidence, and cognitive abilities. People are now beginning to grasp the importance of understanding our thoughts, emotions, and mental health in all areas of our life. Football players have training to improve their focus and mindset, celebrities and politicians integrate mindfulness into their daily lives to manage their stress, and the demand on the NHS to support the public's mental well-being is growing.</p>
<br/><br/><p>Introducing Rize:</p>
<p>    <br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>                             <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1080015/files/20141208043035-SamplePromo1.png?1418041835"" src="""" style=""width: 329.99px; height: 529px;""/></p>
<br/><p><br/></p>
<p>We are creating a multi-platform app that integrates therapeutic concepts into simple information and interactive exercises to help those who need it to understand, track, and improve their mental well-being.</p>
<p>By providing only the best, proven methods to support mental well-being we know this can help a lot of people. We are not providing a platform to treat people suffering from depression, but an environment in which anyone can enter and learn the basic concepts of improving their mindset, well-being, and performance.</p>
<p>Rize has already made a big impact, and before we've even finished the full Rize app we've received overwhelming response and support from the Accelerate Cambridge Program, the London Institute of Psychiatry, MindTech, and a large group of counsellors in the Cambridgeshire area.</p>
<p>I've put the last 15 months of my life into this project, my savings, and my heart. I truly believe in what my team is creating here to make a powerful impact in the world, to help a lot of people. </p>
<p>We're at the final sprint now. The full version of Rize will be available on iOS in a week's time, with just a few additions in functionality to be made. Our business timeline had relied on receiving a grant that we had high hopes for that would allow us to develop Rize for Android, iPad and Tablet. Unfortunately we were successful in getting just under half of what we needed.<br/></p>
<p> We're looking to raise £5k. This will go directly into product development: I can pay my Developer and Designer to complete the final changes and create the app for Android, Ipad and Tablet, so that we can truly reach the wider global population.</p>
<p>Once Rize is available in the app stores it will be available for £2 per week. We've especially designed the app so that people who contribute to this crowdfunding project will be given a code that they can use to access Rize for free. The more you contribute now, the longer you can have full access to all of our content and exercises. </p>
<p>Our biggest risk right now is running out of money. Don't worry, one way or another Rize will be complete and ready. But the sad truth is that in one month we won't have enough money to continue development. I will raise the funds one way or another in the end - getting a job, busking with my guitar, selling my desk for firewood - there's no way that I won't be getting Rize out there and helping people. With your help we can get it out there a lot faster, I can keep my desk, and together we can help a lot of people.</p>
<p>So go ahead, fund this project now! Every minute you wait is another minute you could have been using Rize to supercharge your mental well-being! Don't forget to share this project with your friends, co-workers and family - as many people as possible. <br/></p>

So I did my research - I started going on website's that provided a lot of information on depression and how I can face my negative thought patterns to help myself. I looked at apps, videos, documentaries, journals, books, and even went to a few conferences. The content of all of these were admittedly dry and quite boring, but I forced myself to get through this, as I understood the importance of what this information could do for people.
Eventually I started feeling better and able to get out into the full world again. I started talking to a counsellor, I got a job as a Research Assistant and I started playing music again. I still had some horrible lows, but from all that I had learnt I was able to develop an understanding that there was actually a light at the end of the tunnel. I kept having nagging thoughts in the back of my head though - 'How many other people have gone through the same thing as me? How many of them didn't find the right support to help them? How many people desperately need support right now?'
I started doing research in my spare time. I researched for myself all of the best, scientifically-proven methods to help people  --  not only those with depression, but everyone -- to improve their mental well-being. At the same time I researched the prevalence of depression, anxiety and stress. The results were shocking:

1/4 of the UK population will experience a mental illness in the course of a year, with depression and anxiety as the most common problems.
The World Health Organisation describes depression as the leading cause of disability in the world.

I began talking to a lot of people - psychiatrists, people with depression, other people with no previous history of mental illness. Wherever I went I found there was a huge demand for an engaging and simple way for people to access, understand, and practise the best ways to improve our mental well-being: our focus, ability to manage stress levels, our mental health, our confidence, and cognitive abilities. People are now beginning to grasp the importance of understanding our thoughts, emotions, and mental health in all areas of our life. Football players have training to improve their focus and mindset, celebrities and politicians integrate mindfulness into their daily lives to manage their stress, and the demand on the NHS to support the public's mental well-being is growing.
Introducing Rize:
    

                             

We are creating a multi-platform app that integrates therapeutic concepts into simple information and interactive exercises to help those who need it to understand, track, and improve their mental well-being.
By providing only the best, proven methods to support mental well-being we know this can help a lot of people. We are not providing a platform to treat people suffering from depression, but an environment in which anyone can enter and learn the basic concepts of improving their mindset, well-being, and performance.
Rize has already made a big impact, and before we've even finished the full Rize app we've received overwhelming response and support from the Accelerate Cambridge Program, the London Institute of Psychiatry, MindTech, and a large group of counsellors in the Cambridgeshire area.
I've put the last 15 months of my life into this project, my savings, and my heart. I truly believe in what my team is creating here to make a powerful impact in the world, to help a lot of people. 
We're at the final sprint now. The full version of Rize will be available on iOS in a week's time, with just a few additions in functionality to be made. Our business timeline had relied on receiving a grant that we had high hopes for that would allow us to develop Rize for Android, iPad and Tablet. Unfortunately we were successful in getting just under half of what we needed.
 We're looking to raise £5k. This will go directly into product development: I can pay my Developer and Designer to complete the final changes and create the app for Android, Ipad and Tablet, so that we can truly reach the wider global population.
Once Rize is available in the app stores it will be available for £2 per week. We've especially designed the app so that people who contribute to this crowdfunding project will be given a code that they can use to access Rize for free. The more you contribute now, the longer you can have full access to all of our content and exercises. 
Our biggest risk right now is running out of money. Don't worry, one way or another Rize will be complete and ready. But the sad truth is that in one month we won't have enough money to continue development. I will raise the funds one way or another in the end - getting a job, busking with my guitar, selling my desk for firewood - there's no way that I won't be getting Rize out there and helping people. With your help we can get it out there a lot faster, I can keep my desk, and together we can help a lot of people.
So go ahead, fund this project now! Every minute you wait is another minute you could have been using Rize to supercharge your mental well-being! Don't forget to share this project with your friends, co-workers and family - as many people as possible.",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

Two summers ago, I had the opportunity to travel alongside Educational Safaris to the Amazon Basin of Bolivia for a three week volunteering, language, and cultural immersion adventure. On June 29th, 2013, I have the honor of returning to Bolivia for my second El Puente Trip along with a wonderful team of Middle and High School students.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The goal of El Puente 2013 is simple: to aid the the <strong>Rio Beni Health Foundation</strong> in any way that we can. </span>Our trip will be split between time in the Rurrenabaque medical clinic and journeys to surrounding rural villages to install and check on Bio-Sand Water Filters.  These filters are easy to construct, made with inexpensive materials, are self-sustaining, rarely require upkeep, and are incredibly effective. Since the number-one cause of death in Bolivia is waterborne illness, the filters are vital. </p>
<p class=""p1"">However, this fundraising campaign isn't about us; it's about the foundation. It only costs <em><strong>$3.50 per person per year </strong></em><strong>f<em>or Bolivian healthcare</em></strong>. Our 2013 fundraising goal is $6,000, which would provide preventative healthcare and treatment for 1,714 people! Your donation will help the Rio Beni Foundation work with communities and health workers to immunize children, treat illnesses and injuries, and work to help provide the entire Upper Amazon Basin with clean, potable water. Our fiscal sponsor, Direct Relief, insures that 100% of your donation goes directly to our cause.</p>
<p class=""p1""><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;""><strong>How to Help</strong><br/></span></p>
<p class=""p1"">There are many ways in which you can become involved with the Rio Beni Health Foundation, including:</p>
<div class=""p1"">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Becoming a corporate sponsor. If you work with a business who wishes to make a tax-deductable donation of $250, $500, or $1000, you have the opportunity to be featured on the El Puente 2013 T-Shirt, as well as to be thanked in our Santa Barbara Independent article that will be published in the late summer. This is an excellent opportunity to not only financially support the Rio Beni Health Foundation, but also gain positive publicity.

</li>
<li>Make a private donation right on this site; any amount will help. Once again, the cost of health care per person annually in Bolivia is only $3.50, so even a donation of $5 will honestly change a life!</li>

<p> </p>
</div></div>","Hello, my name is Marandah Field-Elliot, and I'm a seventeen year old student at Santa Barbara High School. Two summers ago, I had the opportunity to travel alongside Educational Safaris to the Amazon Basin of Bolivia for a three week volunteering, language, and cultural immersion adventure. On June 29th, 2013, I have the honor of returning to Bolivia for my second El Puente Trip along with a wonderful team of Middle and High School students.
The goal of El Puente 2013 is simple: to aid the the Rio Beni Health Foundation in any way that we can. Our trip will be split between time in the Rurrenabaque medical clinic and journeys to surrounding rural villages to install and check on Bio-Sand Water Filters.  These filters are easy to construct, made with inexpensive materials, are self-sustaining, rarely require upkeep, and are incredibly effective. Since the number-one cause of death in Bolivia is waterborne illness, the filters are vital. 
However, this fundraising campaign isn't about us; it's about the foundation. It only costs $3.50 per person per year for Bolivian healthcare. Our 2013 fundraising goal is $6,000, which would provide preventative healthcare and treatment for 1,714 people! Your donation will help the Rio Beni Foundation work with communities and health workers to immunize children, treat illnesses and injuries, and work to help provide the entire Upper Amazon Basin with clean, potable water. Our fiscal sponsor, Direct Relief, insures that 100% of your donation goes directly to our cause.
How to Help
There are many ways in which you can become involved with the Rio Beni Health Foundation, including:



Becoming a corporate sponsor. If you work with a business who wishes to make a tax-deductable donation of $250, $500, or $1000, you have the opportunity to be featured on the El Puente 2013 T-Shirt, as well as to be thanked in our Santa Barbara Independent article that will be published in the late summer. This is an excellent opportunity to not only financially support the Rio Beni Health Foundation, but also gain positive publicity. Contact elpuenteteam2013@gmail.com for more information.

Make a private donation right on this site; any amount will help. Once again, the cost of health care per person annually in Bolivia is only $3.50, so even a donation of $5 will honestly change a life!


Share this page! Even if it isn't financially possible for you to contribute, a shoutout on Facebook, Twitter, or an email to your friends will help raise recognition for the cause.

<h3>* THANK YOU to EVERYONE who helped reach our goal to Save Tom's Hand, in barely 15 hours! This outpouring of support is AMAZING! The best part is, this goal was set as a realistically achievable marker for 42 days, and the fact that we crossed this threshold almost immediately means we can continue to reach for the sky and really put a dent in Tom's medical bills! Let's keep spreading the word, because every bit of this goes to Tom and every dollar counts!! Once again, THANK YOU!!! *</h3>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hey folks, how’s it going? My name is Brandon Baumann. I sing for the band Diamond Lane, and that is how I met Tom Chandler many moons ago. Since 2009 we have worked together closely on many projects and have developed a great friendship therein. Tom is a beloved friend to many, an excellent producer, guitar wizard, writing partner, guidance counselor, co-collaborator and all around go-to-guy. He lives for music and the ability to help create something meaningful that will stand the test of time. He prides himself in making sure those things “don’t suck”, for the betterment of us all really. Needless to say, he has selflessly given so much to so many in our music community without ever really asking for anything in return but thanks. The time has come for all of us to step up and help someone who truly needs a hand.</p>
<p>The point of this campaign is to help fundraise contributions to offset Tom’s currently-sky-high-piling medical bills. He has no health insurance and is facing years of debt, sitting in the hospital as I currently type this.</p>
<p>On February 11<sup>th </sup>Tom’s dog Sheila bit his left hand, and it has been a subsequent fast track down hill since. His initial Urgent Care diagnosis revealed that Tom received a staph infection in the bite wounds and that antibiotics should wipe him clean in a few days. When his condition only worsened over the next two weeks, Tom went back to the doctor and they ordered him to immediately see a Disease Specialist. It turns out that Tom developed a gnarly anti-biotic resistant form of staph infection that eventually spread into the bone in his middle knuckle on his left hand. To get fancy, Tom has ostiomylitis in his 3rd metacarpal and was immediately rushed into surgery on February 28th.</p>
<p>So now we’re coming up on a full week stay in the hospital, and when he finally gets discharged (hopefully) on Thursday, that will be an expensive, unpleasant week vacation. Thinking about the cost of surgery, antibiotics, anesthetics and delicious hospital food, MRI’s, blood tests, tissue samples, and all the like makes my head spin. To make matters worse, Tom is going to be on IV antibiotics all day, everyday for the next 6 weeks. Once his hand heals, they may have to reopen it to perform a bone graph to replace the bone that they removed from his knuckle. Physical therapy starts immediately.</p>
<p>We’re talking a long, and very expensive road to recovery here. Let’s keep in mind, Tom does NOT have health insurance. Yikes. I can’t even imagine what’s going through his head right now.</p>
<p>Adding insult to injury, Sheila died less than a week after this incident (RIP Sheila Bean). Maybe this was her way of saying “you’ll never forget me”, but whatever it was, is terrible all the same.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>My goal here is to try and raise $3,000. Obviously this will barely put a dent in the debt but at least it’s SOMETHING. I mean, the IV antibiotics are $300 per bag, at 3 bags a day, for 6 weeks….woah. The point here is to show Tom that we CARE. He has selflessly labored through our rehearsals, writing sessions, recordings and temper-tantrums to better the music world. Have you ever heard of or enjoyed <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">any</span> of the following bands?</p>
<p>Diamond Lane, Cast of Kings, The Shrill, Bolt Action Thrill, Gun Metal Groove, The Marquee, Fire the Animal, Seventh Day, Raven Parade, Jonah Nimoy, Hollowshell, Brock Bentley??? (I’m certain I’m missing some here)</p>
<p>Well the common denominator here is Tom Chandler.</p>
<p>Beyond that, Tom is a FANTASTIC guitar player and a computer whiz -- Cubase, not ProTools....yet :) -- and to think that he may never function in the same capacity is terrifying. I can’t even imagine what he’s going through emotionally, let alone physically.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>In exchange for your patronage, there are a multitude of fun incentives that go beyond the satisfaction of helping out a friend in need. Everything from a simple high-five, a personal phone call and a pitcher of beer to a homemade breakfast or recording of your own song in a high-end recording studio. These are meant to be fun and light hearted as a sincere “thank you”! You gotta know that Tom will be gracious and happy that people actually care. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If we don’t reach the goal, that’s fine, every cent (after IndieGoGo takes their small percentage for facilitating the process), of the money will still go to Tom. If we can exceed the goal, then even better. I believe we can. I just didn’t want to throw up a huge number and have people feel intimidated. Every dollar counts. No joke. </p>
<p>Infections, surgeries, hospital stays and lots of post-surgery rehab on the horizon, I want to do my duty as a friend to help any way I can. I encourage you to do the same. If you can’t contribute anything monetarily, that’s totally fine. We’re all broke. I get that. Just pass this page along and spread the word, if you’d be so kind. I know Tom would appreciate that. The fact of the matter is, his influence has impacted and shaped many of the bands you enjoy and see in Los Angeles and beyond, so let’s give a hand to the guy who’s given more than a few. If we all link up and do our part, we can alleviate some of the weight on his shoulders. Thanks for reading.</p>

<p>For those of you who don't know me already, my name is J.P.
Baker. I will be attending medical school next year, but I am already looking
to make an impact in health care across the globe. I will be traveling to
Nicaragua this spring to participate in a VIDA volunteer medical program, working
in remote clinics around the country. During this time, I will help provide
primary medical care to impoverished communities, curtailing the spread of
infectious diseases and improving the quality of life for all!<br/>
</p>
<p>Right now in Nicaragua there are only 0.37 physicians per
1,000 persons (CIA World Fact Book). Moreover, the government can only
afford to spend $335 per person on health care (World Health Organization),
with little of this money going to remote communities. Countless people suffer
from terrible yet treatable diseases such as bacterial diarrhea, hepatitis A,
and typhoid fever. <br/>
<br/>
Your generous donation will go toward funding my trip and providing medical
supplies to the people of rural Nicaragua. As the direct recipient of your
support, I will ensure that your money is used in the most efficient and
beneficial manner. Your donation, large or small, will be greatly appreciated
by me and the people of Nicaragua.<br/>
<br/>
Last year, I participated in a VIDA volunteer medical program in Guatemala.
During this trip I was able to interact directly with individuals afflicted by
intestinal parasites, malnutrition, bacterial infections, and other easily
treatable conditions. As part of a team of 15 volunteers, we provided medical
care to over 300 people over the course of a week. I hope to surpass that
number this year in Nicaragua!</p>

<br/><br/>
Not long after that, Rosie was born - a healthy and happy little girl. Rosie was delivered cesarian. While the doctors were in there for the cesarian, they removed a mass of cancerous tumor the size of a softball and handed it to us in an old rusty mason jar - the healthcare system in Guatemala is very poor.
<br/><br/>
Zaira was happy, healthy and strong all during her pregancy and for the first year after Rosie was born. But, now the cancer is taking hold again. Alfonzo could not cope and left. Zaira is weak, has a hard time walking and passes-out frequently. Zaira's abdomen is distended from the cancer that is growing inside her. Zaira will not be with us much longer. But Rosie will be with us for a very long time and for that we are very grateful :)
<br/><br/>
Help us set some funds aside for Rosie and Zaira - hospice care, funeral and something to take care of Rosie, after Zaira is gone.
<br/><br/>
Zaira is a wonderful woman. Zaira has helped us here at Buenas Cosas for years. Zaira even took on the responsibility as coordinator of our Community Center in San Pedro for a year - our volunteers loved her - we love Zaira too :)
<br/><br/>
Zaira has given much during her 24 years on this planet. Now it's time for us to help her, and Rosie too.

Zaira will be 25 on September 6th. Please help us give Zaira a wonderful birthday present, security for the most important thing in her life... her only daughter, Rosie.

<h2>The Need</h2>
<p>The Augsburg Men’s Soccer team uses data to make informed decisions. Our players also use their hearts. Through the VX Sports Monitoring System and Video Analysis System, we monitor both - player data and heart rate - to ensure we create the safest, most developmentally challenging environment in the Minnesota Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (MIAC). </p>
<p>The two systems allow players, to use our already purchased vests: </p>
<ul>
<li>To track their every movement: distance, speed, # of accelerations, heart rate, etc.</li>
<li>Use the platforms to reflect and receive feedback to increase their performance goals and growth</li>
<li>To conveniently access information on their phone on and off campus to prepare for training</li>
</ul>
<p>Due to COVID, we don't have the funds to renew the software needed for our players to use the systems. Any funds raised over the $5,500 needed will go directly to the Men's Soccer Endowment to support the long term health and stability of the program.</p>

<p align=""center""><strong>IMAGINE</strong></p>
<p><br/><em><strong>Close your eyes and imagine......</strong> </em> Imagine that you are once again nine years old.  School has just started; you have new teachers and new friends.  You're taller than you were last year and you can run faster.  You have an arithmetic test tomorrow and you are dreading it.</p>
<p>   <br/> For the past few months, you have had a pain in the back of your head.  Sometimes, your vision is blurry.  Without warning, you become dizzy and often, the pain is so bad that you want to cry.  You have been afraid to tell your mom about the pain because you know that she will take you to the doctor.  One day, she noticed you crying and you told her what was bothering you.</p>
<p><br/> After trips to more doctors and hospitals than you can count, and tests whose names you cannot pronounce or spell, your mom and dad come out of the doctor's office, crying.  They sit down with you and the doctor, and try to explain to you that you have cancer.  You have heard your parents talk about cancer.  But always, it was ""Joe died of cancer yesterday."" or ""Sally has cancer and she has four months to live.""  You don't really know what cancer is, but you know that it is bad, <strong>Very bad</strong>.</p>
<p><br/> The doctor explains to you that there are medicines that you can take and treatments that you can be given to slow down or kill the cancer.  The doctor explains that you will be very sick.  You may lose your hair.  You will be tired and you will miss a lot of school. All of a sudden, you are ready for that arithmetic test and wish you could take it right now.  But you know that that is not going to happen. For the next six months, you visit the hospital on a regular basis.  All the doctors and nurses know you by name.  They stick needles in your arm to give you medicine that makes you sick.  They give you chemotherapy that makes you throw up and causes your hair to fall out.  You are nine and a half years old and you have no hair.  Many of your classmates laugh at you.  No one seems to understand that you are really sick.  You feel alone, even when you are surrounded by many people. </p>
<p> <br/> One day your parents talk to you about going to summer camp.  You're scared.  You don't want to go to a camp with people you don't know.  You don't want anybody else laughing at you.  Your doctor and parents have explained that if you fall or cut yourself, you might contract a secondary infection.  You have limits on what you can do, and you are afraid that you might get hurt and die. Your parents explain to you that this is a special camp for children who are sick, just like you.  There will be doctors and nurses there who you know.  You have never been to camp before but you have heard your friends talk about going to camp. You are afraid but you are also curious and the more you think about it, the more you want to go.</p>
<p> <br/> Finally, the day comes when you leave for camp.  Your parents take you to meet the bus, and the bus is full of kids your age and older.  Some of the kids are wearing hats and bandannas.  Some are wearing wigs too big for their head.  You sit down next to a boy two years older than you.  He sticks out his hand ""Hi, I'm Eric, I'm 11 years old and I'm a two-year bone marrow transplant survivor. What's your name?"" Conversations like this go on all over the bus.  Kids are talking about their doctors and nurses.  They are talking about other kids in their school.  You see your mom and dad hand a cooler to the bus driver, who puts the cooler under the bus.  You know that all your medicines are in that cooler.  Most of the kids have their own cooler.</p>
<p><br/> The bus ride lasts five hours.  During that time, a 14 year old girl has become very sick.  The bus stops.  The girl gets off the bus and into a car that has been following the bus.  In the car are parents of other children on the bus.  The bus starts up and the car heads for the nearest hospital with the young girl.  You wonder how she's doing.  After a bus ride that seems to last forever, the bus slows down and pulls into a heavily wooded camp.  Already at the camp are 25 to 30 counselors, aged 18 to 30.  You look at them and can tell that they have been through what you are going through.  As you get off the bus, one of the counselors’ smiles, gives you a big hug, and welcomes you to Camp.  When everyone is off the bus your counselor has three other kids in tow and he leads you off to your cabin.  When you get there, you are surprised to see that the cabin has been decorated and that your name is on a bunk.  You are already feeling at home.  Maybe camp isn't so bad.</p>
<p> <br/> For the next five days, you have the opportunity to run, play, swim, eat, and interact with 70 to 100 other kids with cancer.  By the third day, no one is wearing a wig or hat.  You know most of the kids in camp.  You eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner together.  You take your medicines together.  You laugh and cry together. You walk by a group of older kids, who are talking about other kids.  You hear one ask about Larry, who was at camp last year, but is not here this year.  Someone else mentions that Larry died three months ago.  Larry was 13 years old.  You start to get scared.  The older group notices you.  They call you over, tell you not to worry and make you part of their group.  All of a sudden, you feel better about yourself.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Open your eyes.  This is not a dream.</strong>  You are at Rotary's Camp Florida (RCF).  RCF was founded to acquire, operate and maintain a year-round camp facility for children with special medical needs.  In addition to children with cancer, RCF hosts groups supporting children with Diabetes, Muscular Dystrophy, MS, and other debilitating diseases. Further, RCF makes its facilities available to special needs adult groups providing support for breast cancer survivors. An average camp is 80 to 110 campers per week, with virtually all of the summer weeks filled and most weekends the remainder of the year filled.</p>
<p>Support networks and life-long friendships are formed at RCF.  Children and counselors who are off treatment serve as role models and offer hope for those currently undergoing painful therapy.  For many of the children, this is their first and only chance to participate in normal life experiences during their struggle with cancer.</p>
<p><strong>Second only to accidents, cancer is the number one cause of death of children age one through fifteen.  Only accidents take more lives from children.  In the past year, cancer occurred in approximately 7,800 children and took the lives of approximately 1,500.  One-third of these children died from leukemia.  However, in the past 40 years, the death rate from childhood cancers has dropped by almost 60 per cent.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rotary's Camp Florida needs your help to get the new roof on our camp infirmary!  Camps use this facility to house medical professionals and staff while camp is in session. It operates as a clinic for any medical issues that arise at camp. Medication is stored there and the facility is completely handicapped accessible. Our infirmary has 9 hospital beds. <br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>By contributing you can make a difference in the life of a child!!!<br/></strong></p>

 The bus ride lasts five hours.  During that time, a 14 year old girl has become very sick.  The bus stops.  The girl gets off the bus and into a car that has been following the bus.  In the car are parents of other children on the bus.  The bus starts up and the car heads for the nearest hospital with the young girl.  You wonder how she's doing.  After a bus ride that seems to last forever, the bus slows down and pulls into a heavily wooded camp.  Already at the camp are 25 to 30 counselors, aged 18 to 30.  You look at them and can tell that they have been through what you are going through.  As you get off the bus, one of the counselors’ smiles, gives you a big hug, and welcomes you to Camp.  When everyone is off the bus your counselor has three other kids in tow and he leads you off to your cabin.  When you get there, you are surprised to see that the cabin has been decorated and that your name is on a bunk.  You are already feeling at home.  Maybe camp isn't so bad.
  For the next five days, you have the opportunity to run, play, swim, eat, and interact with 70 to 100 other kids with cancer.  By the third day, no one is wearing a wig or hat.  You know most of the kids in camp.  You eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner together.  You take your medicines together.  You laugh and cry together. You walk by a group of older kids, who are talking about other kids.  You hear one ask about Larry, who was at camp last year, but is not here this year.  Someone else mentions that Larry died three months ago.  Larry was 13 years old.  You start to get scared.  The older group notices you.  They call you over, tell you not to worry and make you part of their group.  All of a sudden, you feel better about yourself.

Open your eyes.  This is not a dream.  You are at Rotary's Camp Florida (RCF).  RCF was founded to acquire, operate and maintain a year-round camp facility for children with special medical needs.  In addition to children with cancer, RCF hosts groups supporting children with Diabetes, Muscular Dystrophy, MS, and other debilitating diseases. Further, RCF makes its facilities available to special needs adult groups providing support for breast cancer survivors. An average camp is 80 to 110 campers per week, with virtually all of the summer weeks filled and most weekends the remainder of the year filled.
Support networks and life-long friendships are formed at RCF.  Children and counselors who are off treatment serve as role models and offer hope for those currently undergoing painful therapy.  For many of the children, this is their first and only chance to participate in normal life experiences during their struggle with cancer.
Second only to accidents, cancer is the number one cause of death of children age one through fifteen.  Only accidents take more lives from children.  In the past year, cancer occurred in approximately 7,800 children and took the lives of approximately 1,500.  One-third of these children died from leukemia.  However, in the past 40 years, the death rate from childhood cancers has dropped by almost 60 per cent.
Rotary's Camp Florida needs your help to get the new roof on our camp infirmary!  Camps use this facility to house medical professionals and staff while camp is in session. It operates as a clinic for any medical issues that arise at camp. Medication is stored there and the facility is completely handicapped accessible. Our infirmary has 9 hospital beds. 
By contributing you can make a difference in the life of a child!!!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>It is exceedingly difficult to get land in Israel as well as funds for such venture.  Yet we now have finally got such land, pefectly suited to our needs and the park's, plus full wonderful cooperation of the National Parks Authority (whom have never done such project before).  The Authority have ample manpower (worth most of the cost of building the course) but no funds.   </p>

<p><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Our hearts are drenched in bitter sweet joy when we think about our boys</em></strong>.  </p>
<p>We have two beautiful boys Aidan (8 years) and Kaden (8 months). Our youngest son Kaden came into the world with a lot of difficulty breathing and was admitted to NICU (Neo-intensive Care Unit) after birth. This was the beginning of the challenging times to come. A few months ago Kaden has been diagnosed with a rare genetic chromosomal deletion on (chromosome 2 - 2q 24.1-24.3q); there are about 20 known cases in the world. It had been determined that our son is missing 37 genes in total. Specialists know what only 2 of the 37 genes do. As a result of the genetic deletion Kaden has what is known as Central Hypotonia (low muscle tone), global developmental delay, risk for epileptic seizures and other risks that are unknown at this time. Kaden also has Auditory Neuropathy Spectrum disorder which is a rare hearing loss disorder, it can include difficulty comprehending spoken language due to the auditory nerve not being functional. We recently learned that Kaden is not a candidate for a cochlear implant which was very difficult to hear however he is an Auditory Brainstem Implant candidate which is a difficult surgery offered outside of Canada (in Italy) that comes with risks and a very high cost.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>We discovered around 2 months of age that Kaden was not able to hold his head up.  We have since been working tirelessly with him to improve his condition. At 9 months of age the physical capabilities of holding up his head and body are that of a 3 month old baby. Kaden is currently seeing many specialists; Neurologist, Optometrist, ENT specialist (Ear, Nose and Throat), Genetic specialist, Audiologist, Speech therapist, Occupational therapist, Physiotherapist. Despite his difficulties Kaden is a beautiful, happy and easy going baby boy. He is at the age where in order for him to learn and achieve as much as possible he needs to get help now while his brain is still adaptable to learning new tasks and make new neuronal connections. The therapy he needs has to be intense and ongoing in order for him to progress and not regress; Kaden's physiotherapy is only on bi-weekly basis for two months at a time with 6-8 weeks off in between. He gets to see a physiotherapist only 4 times within two months.</p>
<p>We are here today to ask for your help. We are eager to help our son and need to do whatever it takes to help him learn to sit, stand, walk, run, hear and talk. Kaden needs to grow and learn to become self-reliant.  </p>
<p>This is possible, though it will take a lot of funds in order to receive the medical intervention that he desperately needs. With your contributions we will be able to take Kaden to a very specialized physiotherapy (which is currently not covered through the government) to get him the adequate intensive therapy that he needs. For example CME Therapy (Cuevas Medek Exercise Program) is an excellent specialized form of physiotherapy which provokes natural instinct and teaches children like Kaden to walk and become self-reliant. Intensive therapy like this costs $300 dollars per day. This intensive therapy is done twice per day and 5 days per week. This is just one of the expenses for Kaden, not to mention eye glasses, hearing aids, possibility of brain stem surgery, special baby formula that Kaden needs due to his cow milk protein and soy milk protein intolerance. </p>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>Dear Friends, we have made a difficult decision to go forward and ask you for financial help. We need to be able to afford CME intensive physiotherapy for Kaden on an ongoing basis which costs $300 per day at five days per week.  Kaden got his first pair of glasses because he is far sighted and cannot see well up close, he will eventually need new glasses every few months as he is a growing baby. His first pair of glasses cost $320. We were able to get him hearing aids which cost us $1650 + new ear moulds every couple of weeks to a month which are $160 for both ears.  These costs are ongoing and accumulate very quickly. In our desperate attempt to help our son we ask you to help us make these interventions possible for him. Every bit contributed will make a difference for Kaden.</p>
<p>We know we are not the only parents who are going through this so with any excess contributions we get to help Kaden we would like to pay a portion of it forward as our way of saying thank you for helping us. Funds will go to other babies and their families who need help just like we do. Many families come to Toronto's Sick Kids Hospital from all over the world with similar challenges to improve their health, whether it is hearing, sight, or lifesaving surgery. For example giving a child hearing aids and enabling a child to hear for the first time is heartwarming, life changing experience for the child and their family. The investment in Kaden's hearing aids had a significant impact on our financial situation so being able to pay it forward (if even a little) and help others would be an honour.  We have made small but meaningful contributions to Sick Kids in hopes of being there for a child and family who need it the most. </p>
<p>Today we are doing what is best for our baby boy, we are asking you to make a financial contribution to Kaden's Fund. </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Being able to do this for our son brings hope for a better future for Kaden; there is nothing a mother and father wouldn't do for their kids! The ability to transform Kaden's life and watch it as it happens is the greatest joy to us. There are no words to describe the happiness Kaden has brought to us, we are learning so much from this little guy.</p>
<p>Please help change our baby's life and his future. Kaden deserves a fair chance at life as it should be.  He will benefit tremendously by receiving the intervention he desperately needs.</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We have faith that Kaden will get the help that he needs through your contributions which will allow us to provide the therapies and devices our baby desperately needs.</p>
<p>Please pray for Kaden as we believe he needs that too. We pray for him every day and know that if you pray for our son it can make a world of difference for him.</p>
<p>Please share our story with your friends and family and let them know the help we need today.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thank you for all of your contributions, it means the world to us.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Hi there.</p>
<p>My name's Chris. I write a <a href=""http://fromthebungalow.wordpress.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""... from the bungalow"">blog</a> and sometimes I make music. I thank my mom for that and for so many other things. Sadly, she passed away a couple of days ago, sooner than expected, leaving my dad with a lot more expenses than anticipated. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, a.k.a. Lou Gehrig's Disease) took her life at age 56.</p>
<p>I'm trying to raise funds to help my dad pay for the funeral expenses. My mom had a life insurance policy, but the cost is going to leave him struggling. Your generous financial support would mean the world to me, my dad, and to the rest of my family.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>My mom passed away much sooner than anyone expected. We made funeral arrangements as a family, and we were very conservative. But because she died outside of her birth state, the costs are high. (Who knew it would cost so much to have a funeral home ship remains to another state?!) That said, the funeral expenses total roughly $12,000. Here's the breakdown:</p>
<ul>
<li>Casket: $2995</li>
<li>One day of visitation: $750</li>
<li>Guest registration package: $100</li>
<li>Forwarding of remains to another funeral home: $2550</li>
<li>Cost of flight to transport remains: $600</li>
<li>Air shipping container for casket: $200</li>
<li>Home state funeral home receiving and services: $3050</li>
<li>Grave site opening and closing: $1120</li>
<li>Six copies of death certificate: $66</li>
<li>Misc. (food, fuel to drive to home state, etc.): $500</li>
<li>Clergy services: $0 (I couldn't talk her into accepting payment.)</li>
<li><strong>Approximate Total: $11,931</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Perks: </strong>If you want, I will autograph and mail you a copy of your favorite blog post, write a blog post on the subject of your choice, send you some homemade soap, even record a cover song for you! I'll even make you a personalized video. Whatever! All for my dad in honor of my mom!</p>
<p><strong>Every little bit helps!</strong> I don't necessarily expect to reach $12,000, but I told my dad I could raise <em>at least</em> $3000. Everything after that helps that much more. If by some miracle we raise the entire <strong>$12k</strong>, all funds raised beyond the cost of the funeral-related expenses will be donated to the ALS Association.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>My dad has given up so much to be able to help my mom with her illness, and he's done so graciously, without complaint. Her physical decline has been an emotional, physical, and financial burden on him. He had to quit his job, and he took an early payment on his pension (at a high penalty) to pay for hospital bills and accessibility equipment needed for my mom during her deterioration, including a used, handicap accessible van. The van alone cost $25,000. Those pension funds are used up.</p>
<p>Any financial support my dad receives right now will help ease the burden and soften the blow of having to worry about how he's going to make ends meet. You can help give him some room to breathe.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p><strong>Sharing is Caring!</strong></p>
<p>I understand if you're unable to help financially. Everyone has their own burdens to bear. But whether you can contribute a lot, a little, or none, I humbly ask that you <strong><em>please share this campaign with others</em></strong>. Here are some ways to share and care:</p>

Hi there.
My name's Chris. I write a blog and sometimes I make music. I thank my mom for that and for so many other things.

The infrared light stimulates brain cells (neurons) to produce energy so the brain can carry out its activities at a normal level.        The technologies being studied in these clinical trials are not yet approved by any national regulatory body for the treatment of medical conditions and are presently only for the enhancement of general wellness and mental acuity. Real Users, Real Results""When I need to wake up early I use Niraxx in the 40Hz mode to help me prepare for the long day ahead"" - Guillherme Panno""I'm a college student...

<h3>Brief description and some background:</h3> <p>Hello again. My name is Ricardo Villamizar.</p>
<p>A month ago I decided to start a campaing of knitting one wool cap per day, and give them to cancer patients by the end of the month.</p>
<p>The campaign was successful: I made the caps and I was able to donate them. But the most important gifts for me were the friends I made; the courage, hope, and happiness of the cancer patients, and learning from the people who help their neighbours.</p>
<p>This month I want to replicate the campaign. I hope this time more people get involved and help me to reach the goal:</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b><i>""Bringing happiness, hope and affection, one hat per day"".</i></b></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b><i><br/></i></b></p> </div> <div> <h3>I just need:</h3> <ul>
<li>For this project I need less than $300! Most of the money is needed for buying new wool. Some is used to print new ""bussiness"" cards, letters and photocopying. I need a very small part for transportation and per diem. (If I ask for $500 is only because that amount is the lower limit here on IndieGoGo).</li>
<li>If you are so kind to give <i> more </i>than $300, I can make more caps, because another group of voluntaries (who work at another hospital) is also interested in my campaign.<i> I will post news and updates about this new group, as soon as I get more feedback from them.</i>

<ul><li>This time I decided to knit 5 sheep wool caps as rewards, with the same pattern and appearance of the other 20 caps.

""The Most Advanced Sunglass Lenses 
on the Planet!"" 
                                   
                                      “These Sunglasses Kick A** ”                                                                                      

          If you want the most awesome and technically superior sunglasses on the planet, this will be the most exciting message you’ll read all year! What's this Campaign About? We are excited to introduce revolutionary sunglasses with lenses with a new Vision Technology, improved frames, and an expanded line including a Snow-Goggle with lenses (with a new proprietary Vision Technology) available only from Orion4Sight. **************************************************************************JUST IN:  Here's a comment from a supporter of this campaign who already received his new ORION4Sight Sunglasses (comment used with Joe Power's permission):""Just ordered a second pair with the black frame. These sunglasses are worth every penny they cost. I've NEVER had a pair like these before. I actually hate to take them off. They actually help seeing at a distance and things are much sharper even in dim lighting. They actually don't make things as dark as the lens would lead you believe. You can actually wear them inside a store and still see just fine. I swear they improve my vision.”Best Regards,Joe Power**************************************************************************In this campaign you'll discover the unique story behind the creation of the lenses in this eyewear, you'll see up-close photos of the Sunglasses and Snow Goggle, you'll learn why we need your support, and you'll learn how you can get a pair of these Sunglasses or Snow Goggle for yourself (and for others) in time for Christmas, all with a $100 savings (while initial stock lasts).   
                                                                                                     Above are the four new O4S Eyewear Styles (frames in                                          black, gray, white...and an amazing new Snow Goggle too) 

       These sunglass lenses are so Kick A** that they have the stamp of approval from some of the toughest and most fiercely competitive people on the planet.At the same time, the sunglasses are for anyone regardless of activity level, from the insanely active Weekend Warrior types, all the way to Senior Citizens and others who enjoy more leisurely activities. Please keep in mind that it's not the frames that make these sunglasses so different and remarkable (though the frames are very good).  It's the lenses and the new Lens Technology that creates the magic.                    This woman is wearing the new O4S sunglasses with sleek white frames.  
         We invite you to take the following ORION4Sight challenge!  1.  Discover HOW our new lenses with unique Vision Technologies can immediately benefit you.2.  Discover WHY the lenses in our ORION4Sight eyewear and O4S Snow Goggles render traditional sunglasses and ski/snow goggles archaic.3.  Then we invite you to try the ORION4Sight sunglasses and/or the O4S Snow Goggle.  Your personal experience is the only validation you need to become a loyal ORION4Sight advocate.WE KNOW these lenses with our new VISION TECHNOLOGIES ARE SPECIAL, and offer this guarantee:100% Guaranteed Quality100% Guaranteed to Perform100% Guaranteed to Please YouOr 100% Refund within 30 days (less shipping) An Exciting New Vision Technology

When you choose these ORION4Sight (O4S) sunglasses, you will look through the very best sunglass lenses you can get.   The sunglasses are stylish and good looking, but it's the lenses utilizing the O4S Vision Technology that makes this superior.Where 99.9% of all sunglasses have colored plastic or glass lenses (and just plain aren't very good), these lenses with our proprietary Vision Technologies are protected by closely guarded trade-secrets.   The lenses puts this eyewear on an entirely different plane than anything you've ever looked through before. Here's a technical graphic illustrating ""Why it Works.""
                                              The Technology makes the difference!When you look through the lenses of these sunglasses and snow goggle, the world looks different, better, more vivid, more clear, more beautiful!  You'll see things you've never even noticed before.  Following are just some of the benefits of the technology you'll enjoy in the lenses of this eyewear: 
· O4S lenses provide improved visual acuity (sharpness) making objects appear sharper and in greater detail· O4S lenses provide improved scene contrast· O4S lenses eliminate squinting and eye strain, regardless of weather or lighting conditions· O4S lenses have anti-fog and anti-scratchcoatings· O4S lenses enhance and sharpen your vision while reducing eyestrain· O4S lenses are manufactured to most of the safety requirements of  ANSI Z-87.1       · O4S lenses block 99.9% of UVA and UVB light     ·O4S lenses also provide reduced dark/light transitional times as you move between dark/light environments.                                                This man is wearing the new ORION4Sight                                   Sunglasses with Military Gray FramesHere are 11 Additional Scientifically Documented ORION4SIght Sunglass lens benefits:1.  Visible light is “regulated” by unique O4S optical properties embodied within the  Sunglass lens -- similar to features used in “highly specialized camera filters."" 2.  Colors “similar” to the O4S lens do not deliver the same visual performance.  3.  Optical physicists call this color-paradox “metamerism.” This simply means “Colors which look like O4S lenses seldom perform equally.""  4.  You need only one pair of Sunglasses for ALL Seasons and All Weather Conditions: Proprietary and Synergistic O4S lens features eliminate the necessity of changing lenses or eyewear for different weather or lighting conditions.  5.  The O4S lens may initially look reddish-orange to your eye. Independent optical laboratory tests reveal that a normal and healthy human eye will experience very minimal, if any, subject matter color change when looking through a O4S lens.  6.  The reddish-orange color will slowly and “visually fade” and colors from reflected objects (trees, people, scenes, etc.) will appear normal.  7.  The O4S lens increases color saturation, i.e., reds look “redder,” yellow appears more vibrant, etc.  8.  When it’s cloudy, or foggy or snow is falling, the O4S Lens provides enhanced  distance-viewing, as well as significantly improved terrain and scene detail.  9.  A light silver front surface lens coating (on the Military Gray framed sunglasses only) dramatically reduce eye strain and overwhelming brightness experienced in full sun on new fallen snow, at the beach, or on the water   10.  Anti-fog control is achieved by one of the industry’s best anti-fog coatings covering the inside of the lens.   11.  Regardless of the weather conditions, if you can see better, your performance will  improve wearing an ORION4Sight Sunglasses.  
  Why we Need your Support 

We are developing this new eyewear right now.  We are on an epic quest to help men and women of all ages and activity levels around the world benefit from the technologically superior eyewear. When you support this campaign, you will help us advance the O4S technology around the world as we expand our product lines.For your support you have a choice of some attractive perks (see all the perks lower on this page).                             

                            Above is one of the eyewear offered in the campaign:                         O4S Sunglass lenses with new sleek black frames.                                     
 

This Vision Technology comes from a rich Military heritage...The ORION4Sight Vision Technologies are proudly and deeply rooted in a rich US Military and Law Enforcement heritage. We've been providing special patented eyewear - sunglasses with lenses like no other - to the US Special Operations Commands and Law Enforcement Agencies for many years. The new sunglasses featured in this campaign are a new consumer spin-off version of our own patented Vision Technology that boasts a rich military and law enforcement pedigree.     

                         Military and Law Enforcement versions of the Eyewear   The original Vision Technologies used in the Military eyewear of our creation is patented, researched, and proven for their ability to improve vision under extreme lighting conditions.  These are technologies perfectly suited to spin-off for the new eyewear featured in this campaign.  NOTE:  The sunglasses in this campaign are not the military version, but are the new consumer spin-off version boasting the new lenses created for this new line of eyewear.

Another early supporter wrote the following;“...I LOVE THESE SUNGLASSES!  I have several pair of sunglasses, and none of them hold a candle to these!   They are comfortable, the side frameadjusts up and down for a custom fit, and the lens itself...well,what can I say?  I don't have any glare tormenting my eyes when Iwear these.  BEST EVER, and I love supporting the mission too!”-Dr. Rick Kirschner
 
GREAT NEWS for YOU!  What all this means that you can now enjoy these new sunglass lenses which will help take your game, your activity, and your vision experience to an entirely new level.

 Your Reward for Supporting This Campaign
You are in the right place at the right time because for the first time you can get these sunglasses in a choice of three new stylish frames (in classic black, sleek white, and military gray) and you can get the new Snow Goggle as well.       When you get the O4S Sunglasses they’ll be tucked into a white microfiber cleaning bag inside of a rugged protective case (see photo above).  Included is a set of instructions that explain correct usage of the eyewear so you can achieve maximum visual benefits.  (When was the last time you got instructions for use with a pair of sunglasses?  Never, right?  These sunglasses are different!)You Can Choose From the Following Four Perks:      
1.  O4S Sunglasses in Classic Black Frames
$99 (Future retail price will be $199)                 

In classic black frames, these Orion4Sight sunglasses also have a new frame design which is simply awesome looking! They too have 6-base lens for improved optics and have antifog-coating on the inside of the lens, and hard-coating on the outside of the lens for durability and scratch resistance.  These look so cool, and have the O4S lenses that'll change the way you see the world. (And they come with a 100% money-back guarantee.)    
 
                                               
                    2.  O4S Sunglasses in Sleek Military Gray Wrap-around Frames

$99 (Future retail price will be $225)       

This is the same frame used in our military and law enforcement version - built for toughness! These sunglasses are great looking and stylish as well!  Technically, they have the same vision characteristics that the black and white framed sunglasses have. 
The outer lens coating is harder than most, making cleaning easier as well as giving a level of water repellent function for enhanced vision.  (And like the other perks, these come with a 100% money-back guarantee.)                                       

3.  O4S Sunglasses in Elegant White Frames
$99 (Future retail price will be $199)
In elegant white frames, these O4S sunglasses have a new frame design and look fantastic!They have a 6-base lens for improved optics and have antifog-coating on the inside of the lens, and hard-coating on the outside of the lens for durability and scratch resistance.  They have lenses with the new Vision Technology that's unavailable in any other sunglasses. (And these also come with a complete 100% satisfaction money-back guarantee.)                               
                   
 4.  The O4S World-Class Snow Goggle$165 (Future retail price will be $265)

                                                         We are thrilled to introduce the ORION4Sight Snow Goggle! This is the only goggle in the world with the O4S lens technology.  It is good looking and will be admired on the slopes and elsewhere (and comes in an attractive carrying case and with instructions as show in the photo above).  It has soft foam that gives complete face seal and extreme comfort regardless of temperatures.  It has 360 degree air vents, and the open cell foam allows air to pass but keeps foreign particles out.  It has Anti-fog coating on the inside that keeps lens from fogging when the temperatures vary from inside the goggle to the outside.  It comes with a handsome white case with an attachment for hooking on a belt and storage when not in use.  The outer lens coating is harder than most, making cleaning easier as well as giving a level of water repellent function for enhanced vision while in use.  This Snow Goggle is simply world-class (and of course, this comes with a 100% money-back guarantee too!). Who invented this Vision Technology?
Kirk Kreutzig is the inventor and founder/sole owner of ORION4Sight Ltd, an Optical Company located in the western suburbs of Chicago.   He is a multi-patent holder whose company was formed to advance the new Vision Technology-driven sunglass lenses and Goggle featured in this campaign. 
Kirk has a strong academic background in science and biology and is a world-traveled and a semi-retired scientific/commercial photographer with 45+ years behind the camera.  His years as a scientific photographer was instrumental in his developing the original military night vision technologies, and ORION4Sight’s rapidly expanding line of Consumer Eyewear products.Kirk has also hinted that new trailblazing O4S Vision products are approaching final development, and that these new eyewear products are expected to improve the vision for countless segments of the rapidly aging global population.  (Stay tuned!  These additional products should be available in the very near future.)

We can not let this happen. It would debilitate his ability to play drums, and even function in day to day life. I know that the very thought of this makes any musician,any person cringe.

We launch this campaign on Indiegogo to spread the word about RESUKO© and to to raise the fundings for its distribution.

<b>Genesis</b>
</div><div>
<p style=""""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0.0px;"">For me as an eager riddle solver – always in the search for new riddles – Sudoku, the on all sides present logic riddle, slowly became monotonous in the course of time: As Sudoku – invented by brilliant Mr. Leonhard Euler (1707-1783) – has its fixed dimensions of 9x9 fields and the numbers 1 to 9 are not expandables. </span></p>
<p style=""""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0.0px;"">My mathematical analysis proved – without rotations, reflexions and exchanges – there exist only 46'656 different possibilities: 24x24x81. Therefore I was of the opinion that it was time for a new riddle to be invented: A riddle with infinite possibilities of both dimensions and forms and a closeness to global interest as for example cars have.</span></p>
<p style=""""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0.0px;"">Everyone is sold on riddles of any kinds and velocity. Racing however is dangerous in real life, so we have brought the race on safe ground: Paper. Afterwards the streets came into play. Over time this riddle developped from an idea to a sketch. The first RESUKO© arose in June, 2009:</span></p>
<p style=""""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0.0px;""></span></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/816503/files/20140827121550-erstes_resuko_ever.jpg?1409166950"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Still only meanless ""lines""...</span></p>
<p style=""""><br/></p>
<p style=""""><b>From ""RACE"" to ""RESUKO""</b></p>
<p style="""">When this idea has been consolidating, the question concerning a powerful and meaningful name has arisen. The final name “RESUKO” has been developed out of various initial names such as""highway riddles"", ""racing riddles"", ""Racetrack"" and ""Race"". The word ""Resuko"" is descended from the Japanese and means “race car”. My enthusiasm for RESUKO© did not remain undiscovered for a long time and the first inquiries for test riddles quickly arrived from the closer circle of acquaintances. The received feedback of the initial test phase was overwhelming throughout and therefore my decision was made to transform RESUKO© into a product. To discover the possibilities of RESUKO© we created a physical generator out of wooden cubes with which we simulated various riddle types and thus simulations discovered the infinite extendibility of RESUKO©. The design of the single elements has changed in the course of progression, so that in the end we figured out the most expressive symbolism: At first the circuit contained two lanes and there was also a tribune in the grid.<br/><span style=""letter-spacing: 0.0px;""></span></p>
<p style=""""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0.0px;""></span></p>

</div></div>","RESUKO© is a new, exciting and innovative logic riddle from Switzerland. It is versatile, comes in many different styles and forms and therefore arouses enthusiasm in both young and old. It has the potential to might be considered equivalent with similar puzzles such as Sudoku, Battleship and Kenken. We launch this campaign on Indiegogo to spread the word about RESUKO© and to to raise the fundings for its distribution. We have been working for years on its fialization and now we are ready to go worldwide. You will get our great riddle RESUKO© and much more by purchasing our perks… Enjoy the drive!


Genesis

For me as an eager riddle solver – always in the search for new riddles – Sudoku, the on all sides present logic riddle, slowly became monotonous in the course of time: As Sudoku – invented by brilliant Mr. Leonhard Euler (1707-1783) – has its fixed dimensions of 9x9 fields and the numbers 1 to 9 are not expandables. 
My mathematical analysis proved – without rotations, reflexions and exchanges – there exist only 46'656 different possibilities: 24x24x81. Therefore I was of the opinion that it was time for a new riddle to be invented: A riddle with infinite possibilities of both dimensions and forms and a closeness to global interest as for example cars have.
Everyone is sold on riddles of any kinds and velocity. Racing however is dangerous in real life, so we have brought the race on safe ground: Paper. Afterwards the streets came into play. Over time this riddle developped from an idea to a sketch. The first RESUKO© arose in June, 2009:


Still only meanless ""lines""...

From ""RACE"" to ""RESUKO""
When this idea has been consolidating, the question concerning a powerful and meaningful name has arisen. The final name “RESUKO” has been developed out of various initial names such as""highway riddles"", ""racing riddles"", ""Racetrack"" and ""Race"". The word ""Resuko"" is descended from the Japanese and means “race car”. My enthusiasm for RESUKO© did not remain undiscovered for a long time and the first inquiries for test riddles quickly arrived from the closer circle of acquaintances. The received feedback of the initial test phase was overwhelming throughout and therefore my decision was made to transform RESUKO© into a product. To discover the possibilities of RESUKO© we created a physical generator out of wooden cubes with which we simulated various riddle types and thus simulations discovered the infinite extendibility of RESUKO©. The design of the single elements has changed in the course of progression, so that in the end we figured out the most expressive symbolism: At first the circuit contained two lanes and there was also a tribune in the grid.


Finally RESUKO© was ripe for distribution. As manual production of riddles is principally uneconomical GameSky AG was founded, with which we planned to reach the zone of profit by means of an electronic riddle generator. Due to the fact that our business partner was mostly occupied with his own projects RESUKO© got neglected. In the meantime the company has been dissolved and the riddles – still manually created – are being provided once again directly by the inventor himself. The reader’s and publisher’s feedback on the new riddle RESUKO© was and remains exclusively positive. RESUKO© appeared in various newspapers such as “Tagblatt Zürich”, “Zürichsee Zeitung” and “MixLogik” over years. Our goal is to spread RESUKO© worldwide and not only locally since every single riddle solver is pleased with a new exciting riddle. That is where we need your help as a community to make RESUKO© popular and achieve our campaign goal. The advantage of RESUKO© is its linguistic independence, except its instruction manual.

Description
RESUKO© is a logic riddle, as for example Sudoku, Bimaru, Kenken etc. ONLY BETTER!
RESUKO© is not bound to dimensions nor language. Depending on the target audience a precise type of RESUKO© can be chosen (for children, infinite dimensions, forms, types and themes, coloured, difficulty levels, integrated advertisements etc.). 




How to solve RESUKO
Guide: Complete both race tracks (circuit and test track) inserting the given elements in the grid including a pit lane and a parking lot. Thereby apply the following rules:
All elements of the respective line or column are listed in two lists outside of the grid.
The pit lane is situated parallel to four straight lines of the circuit on a clear grid area of 4x1 or 1x4 fields.
The parking lot is located in the single clear grid area of 2x2 fields.
The pit lane and the parking lot are never situated on a given gravel bed field.
The test track is markedly shorter than the circuit.
Tip: Before filling in the elements into the grid, strike all given elements off both lists and every used element while solving the puzzle.

Along with the initial idea of a newspaper’s and magazines’ riddle arose the expansion of RESUKO© into the digital world by means of a mobile application for iPhone, Android and Tablets, which we aim as an additional goal of this campaign. We also want children to enjoy RESUKO©: So we created a stamp set to create your own RESUKO© and painting which is ready for production.

We would like to provide worldwide access to RESUKO© and preserve its high quality and a reliable costumers’ service. 

Campaign Goal
The donated capital will be used as follows: 


50'000 USD for generator’s development (figures are based on the first efforts by GameSky AG)

5'000 USD for trademark protection

5'000 USD for public relations, advertisement and marketing

5'000 USD for programming of online shop 

10'000 USD for development of mobile application as an additional goal.


One of our targets is also the realisation of a mobile application. The mobile app conveys the impression to the riddle solvers, that they are actually racing on their device. This proves again that RESUKO© is able to survive on modern platforms besides traditional media such as newspapers and magazines.

<p>Last Friday night, Michelle was smacked in the back of the head with a metal bat bouncing at the club helping out another security gaurd. She was knocked unconscious with her head split open and continuously beaten while she was out. She has 5 staples in the back of her head now along with 2 herniated disks in her cervical spine and is suffering from a severe concussion including constant extreme dizzyness, nausea, confussion, unable to concentrate, ringing in the ears and constant pain. Michelle has no medical insurance.</p>
<p>Since the incident, she has been to the ER twice which most of you can imagine the bills coming her way. She has also gone to her doctor a few times which is an automatic 90$ charge up front per visit and will need to see a neuro within the next week or two. Her perscriptions have already reached almost $300. This is her third severe concussion (other two sports related) so no one can tell when her symtoms will stop or when she will be fully recovered from this. She has been and will be out of work for quite some time now.</p>
<p>There will be a funraising event held on Michelles birthday, Thursday September 6th at Rumor 35 in South Amboy. The club has agreed to give her all the money that they make that evening. Each person over 21 will be charged 5$ and anyone under 21 will be charged 10$ at the door. The more people we can get, the better.</p>

I am 19 years old now and as an adult I have lost the support of some organizations that used to help me, as they specialized in children’s help.

<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Virginia has been the most trusted provider of affordable women's health care and honest, accurate sex education in Hampton Roads for close to 50 years. One of our main education programs involves comprehensive information sessions on reproductive health, birth control and STI/HIV prevention and testing with domestic violence survivors living in women's shelters across the community. Many of these women are uninsured and have gone way too long without a well-woman exam and breast and cervical cancer screening. We don't receive any state or federal assistance for clinical services and are unable to provide free services without grant or donor funding.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our goal is to provide these women in desperate need of basic health care with free well-woman exams to ensure they are healthy as they embark on the next part of their lives. A well-woman visit at our health center typically costs around $150 and includes the exam and the lab work needed for cancer screening. While this is a fraction of the cost at a private provider, it's still difficult for many women living in shelters to pay. We would like to raise $5,000 to provide exams and cancer screening to at least 25 women in desperate need of this care. The total will also assist women who may need a follow-up screening or further care for an abnormal result.</p>
<p>If you contribute to this campaign, you can feel secure in knowing you may have saved someone's life; and at the very least, you have given an underserved, vulnerable woman a better chance at a healthy, happy future.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, the state does not provide the type of safety net that so many domestic violence survivors and homeless women living in shelters need to help them successfully move on with their lives. We would like to offer these women a safe, confidential, personal environment to receive health care, something that may be traumatic after a violent experience. We feel that these women have been through enough pain and the least we can do is provide them with a basic health screening to allow them peace of mind and the ability to start fresh. Many of these women have children; they need to remain healthy and able to care for them.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We know that not everyone is able to contribute money, but if you care about this cause, please share with your friends and contacts. Every little bit helps and will move us closer to providing necessary health care for some of our most vulnerable community members!</p>

<p>Simple, but more than enough!  The  e v o s s  air cell cushion makes the maximum contact to your body by contouring every corner of the contacted area.  This will reduce the pressure level on your body significantly and promise you the ultimate comfort even for a long duration of sitting.</p>

<p>Hello, I’m Kui Hwang.</p>
<p>     My job is to engineer special rubber products in the semiconductor industry, and am head of Research and Development at Seal Tech Co., Ltd.  We manufacture seal solutions that are critical to producing the semiconductor chips used in electronics.  Understanding the properties rubber has helped me envision helpful applications for living a better life.  I wanted to share this knowledge and my expertise.  With this goal in mind, I developed a product for wheelchair bound individuals; a comfortable, long-lasting seat cushion.</p>
<p>The clear distinction between the cushions I developed and the ones on the healthcare market was the highly set cost to the consumer.  I was able to see that the high price tag of the wheel chair cushion is creating a special market that is only applied for disable communities and I needed to develop the entire process from the scratch in order to create one that is reasonably priced, and more accessible to everyone, like myself.</p>
<p>While I was developing the  e v o s s  from the scratch, I began to use it for myself.  I was experiencing discomfort and back pain from working 16+ hours a day and those issues turned out to real improvements to the product.  I am beginning to be convinced myself that these solutions can help so many others. My role in Seal Tech company allowed me to develop what inspires me, and as I noticed growing trends in the wellness industry, I wanted to start with some healthcare products that have some story with it.</p>
<p>This is how <i><strong>neb</strong></i> was born.  <i>neb</i>’s goal is to improve your quality of life and contribute to your lifestyle.  We consider core values to be caring the people that make up our center circle: family, friends and those you love.  We think wellness should be a personal story, and neb would like to be a part of yours by helping and supporting with advanced quality products.  Our vision is to develop  e v o s s  to support all areas of your life.  For this vision, we need your help.  Please join us as we develop a better life with you, your family, and your friends.  </p>

</div></div>","We are spending 2 hours a day at the most for exercise.  Did you actually realize that we are spending more than 8+ hours a day in a sitted position?  e v o s s  is an air cell cushion originally developed for the disabled community as an innovative solution for Decubitus ulcers (a.k.a bedsore).  It is a cushion that redistributes the individual's sitting pressure, reduces shear force and promotes blood circulation.  Unparalleled comfort only  e v o s s  can deliver  - Just throw yourself on  e v o s s  and it will take care of the rest.Reasonable price for every individual - Now you can enjoy the ultimate air cell cushion product at 60% off of the medical / healthcare market price.

Precision manufacturing in house (Not an OEM or supplied from third party vendors) - Manufactured by master craftsmen who have more than a decade of experiences






Lifestyle cushion that goes with you whenever you need it - Use however / whenever you want it be.
Simple to use. No age or gender constrains.  Just enjoy  e v o s s  and share it with your beloved ones.  That's our ultimate goal after all.

 


We are under the greatest body pressure on our back when we are sitting.  If you sit more than 8 hours a day, you will have more than 2.7 times of your bodyweight on your back.
 



Simple, but more than enough!  The  e v o s s  air cell cushion makes the maximum contact to your body by contouring every corner of the contacted area.  This will reduce the pressure level on your body significantly and promise you the ultimate comfort even for a long duration of sitting.
 

As you are sitting on the  e v o s s  cushion, the contact area deforms and contours the shape of your body.  This will lead your condition to the maximum contact with  the cushion that reduces pressure level significantly.

 Also, with this condition on, the blood vessel gets much less compression and helps better blood circulation

All of these can be done with our optimized cell designs, namely hexagonal and octagonal shaped cells depends on your body shape and weight.

</p><h3><b>About Me</b></h3>
<p>Hello!</p>
<p>It’s time to get something off my chest, literally. My name is
Dylan and I’m a trans guy (FTM) who needs your help to raise funds for top
surgery. I’m a youth worker, bike educator, gardener, and DIY enthusiast who
lives in Boston, Massachusetts. My goals for this year in addition to getting
top surgery also include completing a cross-country bike tour and applying to grad
school for urban planning.</p>
<p>For me, top surgery is medically necessary and will help me
to feel comfortable in my own body. I have never fit neatly into the gender
assigned to me at birth and puberty did not do me any favors. I have used
binding to hide the shape of my chest since I was in high school. But let’s be
real, binding can be physically uncomfortable and makes it difficult to
exercise because it compresses my chest. Although it doesn’t stop me from
swimming or biking, two of my favorite activities, it sure does present its own
physical, social, and emotional challenges from day to day. As I become more
secure in my masculinity, I am finding it harder to reconcile with my chest.</p>
<p>I recently read a great piece of advice from an essay on
transitioning. It said, “Know what you need. Get help. Be patient, but know
when you’ve waited too long.” I have waited 6 years for surgery and I know it
is time to get to where I need to be. Now, I just I need your help to do it.  </p>
<h3><b>My Health Insurance
Denied My Claim</b></h3>
<p>It’s all too common of a story for trans individuals who are
interested in gender confirmation surgery. Because my state-sponsored health
insurance excludes top surgery from coverage, I’m looking at paying $10k
out-of-pocket. My appeal was denied and my search to find an inclusive private
health insurance has been drawn out and largely unsuccessful. Most insurers
only offer the coverage to large group plans, but not to individuals or small
businesses. The letter from my insurance company denying me the coverage stated
that it was not barring me from pursuing the services, but that I would be
responsible for paying them in full. Understandably, a $10k price tag does create
a substantial financial barrier that is hard to overcome alone. </p>
<p>I have saved $7k on my own over the past year. How you ask? I’m
a thrifty person and I’ve made it my mission to see that I meet my goal. If
you’ve met me you know that I’ve taken a few notes while watching TLC’s <a href=""http://www.tlc.com/tv-shows/extreme-cheapskates"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Extreme Cheapskates</a>. I bike year-round, bake my own bread, and enjoy DIY reuse projects.
Still, since most of my youth work jobs are seasonal, my savings plateaued this
winter with my bills catching up to me. I am in the final stretch and I need
your help to raise the remaining amount of $3k! </p>
<h3><b>Budget Breakdown</b></h3>
<p>All-inclusive Surgery/Doctor’s Fee  $9,500</p><p><u style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">+ Cost of Living During Recovery    $500</u></p>
<p>Total Cost    $10,000</p>
<p>Dr. Richard Bartlett is located in Brookline, MA so there is
no additional cost for travel. His all-inclusive fee includes the cost of the
anesthesiologist and the facility. The cost of living during recovery was
estimated to include wages lost for one week of work, the cost of ¼ of my
monthly rent, and other small recovery related expenses. Note that I have added
$250 to my fundraising goal to compensate for the service fees charged by Indiegogo.</p>
<h3><b>The Perks!  </b></h3>
<p>Aside from the good feelings that come with donating to a
cause that can truly change a person’s life for the better, you can also look
forward to a special personalized or handmade gift. </p>
<p><i>$10 Thank You Card </i>– A thank you card with a personalized
message to show my appreciation for your support. </p>
<p><i>$20 Mini French Bulldog Prints (Set of 2) </i>– Who doesn’t love
cute photos of Frenchies?! Get two mini square prints of Opie, the dog I live
with, looking super adorable from a grab bag of 12 different photos. A big shout out to my roomies, Mackenzie and Corie, for their help with this project! </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/400713/files/20140228095354-Screen_shot_2014-02-28_at_12.19.35_PM.png?1393610034"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p>

Hello!
It’s time to get something off my chest, literally. My name is
Dylan and I’m a trans guy (FTM) who needs your help to raise funds for top
surgery. I’m a youth worker, bike educator, gardener, and DIY enthusiast who
lives in Boston, Massachusetts. My goals for this year in addition to getting
top surgery also include completing a cross-country bike tour and applying to grad
school for urban planning.
For me, top surgery is medically necessary and will help me
to feel comfortable in my own body. I have never fit neatly into the gender
assigned to me at birth and puberty did not do me any favors. I have used
binding to hide the shape of my chest since I was in high school. But let’s be
real, binding can be physically uncomfortable and makes it difficult to
exercise because it compresses my chest. Although it doesn’t stop me from
swimming or biking, two of my favorite activities, it sure does present its own
physical, social, and emotional challenges from day to day. As I become more
secure in my masculinity, I am finding it harder to reconcile with my chest.
I recently read a great piece of advice from an essay on
transitioning. It said, “Know what you need. Get help. Be patient, but know
when you’ve waited too long.” I have waited 6 years for surgery and I know it
is time to get to where I need to be. Now, I just I need your help to do it.  
My Health Insurance
Denied My Claim
It’s all too common of a story for trans individuals who are
interested in gender confirmation surgery. Because my state-sponsored health
insurance excludes top surgery from coverage, I’m looking at paying $10k
out-of-pocket. My appeal was denied and my search to find an inclusive private
health insurance has been drawn out and largely unsuccessful. Most insurers
only offer the coverage to large group plans, but not to individuals or small
businesses. The letter from my insurance company denying me the coverage stated
that it was not barring me from pursuing the services, but that I would be
responsible for paying them in full. Understandably, a $10k price tag does create
a substantial financial barrier that is hard to overcome alone. 
I have saved $7k on my own over the past year. How you ask? I’m
a thrifty person and I’ve made it my mission to see that I meet my goal. If
you’ve met me you know that I’ve taken a few notes while watching TLC’s Extreme Cheapskates. I bike year-round, bake my own bread, and enjoy DIY reuse projects.
Still, since most of my youth work jobs are seasonal, my savings plateaued this
winter with my bills catching up to me. I am in the final stretch and I need
your help to raise the remaining amount of $3k! 
Budget Breakdown
All-inclusive Surgery/Doctor’s Fee  $9,500+ Cost of Living During Recovery    $500
Total Cost    $10,000
Dr. Richard Bartlett is located in Brookline, MA so there is
no additional cost for travel. His all-inclusive fee includes the cost of the
anesthesiologist and the facility. The cost of living during recovery was
estimated to include wages lost for one week of work, the cost of ¼ of my
monthly rent, and other small recovery related expenses. Note that I have added
$250 to my fundraising goal to compensate for the service fees charged by Indiegogo.
The Perks!  
Aside from the good feelings that come with donating to a
cause that can truly change a person’s life for the better, you can also look
forward to a special personalized or handmade gift. 
$10 Thank You Card – A thank you card with a personalized
message to show my appreciation for your support. 
$20 Mini French Bulldog Prints (Set of 2) – Who doesn’t love
cute photos of Frenchies?! Get two mini square prints of Opie, the dog I live
with, looking super adorable from a grab bag of 12 different photos. A big shout out to my roomies, Mackenzie and Corie, for their help with this project! 
$25 Hand-stamped Bandana – These bandanas are made using homemade
stamps of glasses, mustaches, or bike gears. They work great as handkerchiefs
too. How dapper! They are available in light blue and royal blue.
$50 Etched Wooden Spoons (Set of 2) – Using a wood burning
technique, these Pinterest-inspired mixing spoons are decorated to make a great conversation piece
at your next dinner party. Cook or bake something delicious with them and then
share it with me, please.

I can’t grow one yet, but I sure can crochet one! I’m willing to customize each
to make sure it fits too. PS I learned how to crochet just for this project and
you’ll be impressed with the results.
