<p>Short Summary</p>
<p>We believe that the development of a global consciousness of humanity is only possible<br/>if there are international organizations that set the enforcing of such consciousness as their<br/>goal. The VAC in Belgrade is our first step on a long road that leads to a global network of<br/>similar hubs aiming to be a powerhouse of socially sensitive artistic and scientific work.<br/>We are a completely independent non-profit organization, not a part of any existing<br/>institution. Although we are not opposed to collaboration with governmental institutions, we<br/>do not want our infrastructure to depend on anybody else but the community we are creating.<br/>We want our unique artistic and scientific approach to stay free and individual, non-biased by<br/>existing power structures and political tendencies.</p>
<p>We have successfully organized the School of Visual Anthropology workshop five years<br/>consecutively for chiefly Serbian participants; more than 100 people participated with the help of 30 lecturers and mentors. Last year we opened for the first time to international applicants and it was the best choice we'd ever made. Local scholars had new impulse, foreigners saw a new environment - it was inspirational for all of us.</p>
<p> This year we set ourselves a new goal - for the whole initiative to be global! Our participants will learn how do we see this happening, and we'd like to learn from them how would they go about it.</p>
<p>What We Need &amp; What You Get</p>
<p>We all know film-making is an expensive business. Shooting documentaries makes it even harder due to their non-commercial nature. What we are aiming for is not to collect funds for a film project and disappear. On the contrary: the workshop we are hosting is just the first step. We firmly believe that in the age of the internet it is possible to create an independent initiative, that doesn't depend on state subventions. Our team is very young and ambitious so your participation means the world to us: if we can make the first step our project may grow in to something  truly significant on the long run! </p>
<p>What we need first and foremost is... you! The call for taking part in School of Visual Anthropology 2019 is open: you can join us in Belgrade between the 10th and the 20th of July and take part in our workshop. Broaden your perspectives with our lecturers, create your short documentary film with the help of our professional mentors and help us lay the foundations of an international hub of social sciences and film. If you can't join us this time you might still want to help us collect the necessary financial means to support the workshop and the work of Visual Anthropology Center. </p>
<p>You can help us create a strong community of filmmakers and social scientists with a the naive yet ever so crucial goal of making the world a better place. The funds collected in this campaign will finance the 10 days workshop that is the first event hosted by VAC. </p>
<p>There will be internationally renowned lecturers and workshop leaders from 8 different countries, 30 participants divided in 5 filming crews. Our goal is to demonstrate that if the costs are shared progressively by the participants and generous donors it is possible to host such an event without commercial sponsoring. The compensations of all lecturers, all participants living costs and the production costs of the short films that will be shot during the workshop will all be included in the workshops price. According to our calculations the average cost of one participant is approximately 400 euros. On the Balkans and in Eastern Europe barely any participant could afford to pay such a price, which is why we made the pricing progressive so the price range is between 200 and 800 euros - it may be hard to believe but for an average Belgrader 100 euros is more or less equivalent of 1000 bucks for a New Yorker... </p>
<p>If we don't reach our entire goal we will need to decrease the dimensions of the workshop proportionately, thus the funds will finance the aforementioned goals nonetheless.</p>
<p>The Impact</p>
<p>The goal of the project is to introduce visual anthropology to established professionals<br/>in film making and/or social sciences who would like to broaden their perspectives as well as<br/>to scholars who are new to this field(s).<br/>We provide theoretical and practical workshops, involving filming and post-production<br/>of short anthropological films. The call is open for applicants with or without experience - what<br/>matters is enthusiasm towards promotion of social awareness through visual anthropology.<br/>Our aim is to encourage critical thinking, fostering tolerance for the Other, while<br/>broadening the knowledge of participants as film-makers and social scientists.</p>
<p>Risks &amp; Challenges</p>
<p>The only risk we see is that the interest is going to be greater amongst a financially less prepared target group. In this case we would have difficulties in covering the costs of the workshop. </p>
<p>We have organized the School of Visual Anthropology successfully 5 times and always managed to overcome the financial difficulties, but this time the project is bigger. We believe that if the interest is as high as we expect than we should have no problem now that the call is open for internationals as well. </p>
<p>We will see the success of our first international workshop as a green light for Visual Anthropology Center as an world wide organisation.</p>
<p>Other Ways You Can Help</p>
<p>Share, share, share! Call your friends who might be interested and spread the word. </p>
<p>One more way you can help is if you contribute to our cause with your knowledge. We'd be happy to publish your work on our pages and more than happy if you'd like to contribute to the creation of the VAC with your knowledge or a word of advice!</p>

The Bindlestiff Family Cirkus has worked so hard to be an independent, inclusive, circus-artist-centric company, and especially, a significant member of the American Circus arts tradition. The Smithsonian's budget is limited, and performances are free public events, so in order to pay our artists and all the costs we describe below, we're asking our supporters for donations and to share this ask with their communities. </p><p><strong>About Bindlestiff Family Cirkus:</strong></p><p>Stephanie Monseu and Keith Nelson founded <a href=""http://bindlestiff.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Bindlestiff Family Cirkus</a> in 1995 in the heart of NYC’s underground club scene. Keith taught Stephanie how to eat fire one fateful night while they were on break from their shifts at the Round the Clock Diner in lower Manhattan, and the rest is history. Bindlestiff is widely acknowledged as an instrumental force in launching the neo-vaudeville, independent circus movement that has grown up (in NYC and beyond) over the past 20-plus years. Hundreds of circus and variety artists have performed with Bindlestiff over the years, from first-time performers to acclaimed circus stars, and we consider them all part of the Bindlestiff Family.</p><p>Bindlestiff has evolved into a nationally touring nonprofit performing arts organization with a mission to cultivate, develop and sustain the circus and variety arts. Today we produce variety shows, free festivals, and theatrical productions, we offer free circus arts education and mentoring for underserved young people, and we create a wide array of opportunities for emerging variety performers to develop new work. Our style reflects our roots in DIY culture, with nods to political street theater and a steady respect for the traditions of American popular entertainment and illegitimate theater: circus, sideshow, burlesque, and vaudeville.</p><p><strong>About our Indiegogo campaign:</strong></p><p>We’re excited to announce that the Smithsonian Center for Folklife and Cultural Heritage has invited Bindlestiff to participate in the 50th Anniversary Celebration of the <a href=""http://www.festival.si.edu/2017/circus-arts/smithsonian"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Smithsonian Folklife Festival</a>, which this year will be celebrating the cultural heritage of the American Circus  -- the very first time the Smithsonian has recognized the circus arts in this way.

The Bootleg Annual 2020© is in no way officially affiliated with D&amp;AD. An official D&amp;AD annual would not be made from cardboard. The Bootleg Annual 2020© is an amateurish attempt to continue the tradition of printing the D&amp;AD Annual, and is designed to be an artistic tribute to the organisation and the work it celebrates. It is not designed to criticise any work or organisations. Please do not sue The Bootleg Annual 2020© (we do not have any money). Any typos, double spaces or ‘mistakes’ in The Bootleg Annual 2020© are included at no additional charge. If your name is mispelt, The Bootleg Annual 2020© implores you to consider it an anecdote to share with your grandchildren. There will be spelling mistakes (there’s definitely one in this paragraph) and there will be misprints. The Bootleg Annual 2020© suggests readers make a game of trying to find them all. Most expenses were spared in the production of The Bootleg Annual 2020©, making every copy ‘special’. For all its faults, at least The Bootleg Annual 2020© is fully recyclable. Turns out recyclable materials are actually cheaper to use. Who knew? The Bootleg Annual 2020© has the same dimensions as previous annuals, give or take a few centimetres. The Bootleg Annual 2020© is however less robust than previous editions and although the page-thumbing enjoyment of readers is actively encouraged, the ‘chucking about’ of the book is not recommended. The Bootleg Annual 2020© accepts no liability for injuries incurred while throwing books and takes no responsibility for any butterfingered readers. The D&amp;AD font is very nice. However, The Bootleg Annual 2020© could not locate the correct font and opted to stretch Helvetica, as everyone seems to be doing that these days. The typesetting (or lack thereof) seen in The Bootleg Annual 2020© may induce migraines in some designers, art directors or typographers.The Bootleg Annual 2020© is not designed to take business from D&amp;AD, it is an artistic tribute to their organisation with a limited run. It is quite simply a physical memento of the most excellent award-winning work of the year. The Bootleg Annual 2020© will not make any profit. Any surplus funds raised will be donated to charity. No refunds. All sales final.</p></div>","UPDATE: Thanks to your help, we hit our goal of crowdfunding 100 books in one day!This campaign has now come to a close.

We did it, kind of.The Bootleg Annual 2020. TAKE MY MONEYWe will be printing a limited run of 100 copies, making The Bootleg Annual 2020, the rarest annual to date.Buy your copy for £58* (it is the 58th annual after all) from the perk panel, where it says click here to buy the book, fill in your payment and delivery details and prepare to wipe down your best shelf space or coffee table.As soon as we hit 100, we'll press print.*Delivery not included FEATURES
550ish pages of outstanding work
Foreword by Sir John Hegarty
Literally tens of other pages of great content
Print edition number on spine
Certified 100% Carbon Neutral, by World Land Trust
Super lightweight and uniquely dented cardboard covers
Super low quality paper
Fully recyclable, so you can bin it if you don’t like it*
Lovely non D&AD-yellow end cover
* All sales finalDISCLAIMERThe Bootleg Annual 2020© is crowdfunded by the creative community and printed for personal use only. The Bootleg Annual 2020© is in no way officially affiliated with D&AD. An official D&AD annual would not be made from cardboard. The Bootleg Annual 2020© is an amateurish attempt to continue the tradition of printing the D&AD Annual, and is designed to be an artistic tribute to the organisation and the work it celebrates. It is not designed to criticise any work or organisations. Please do not sue The Bootleg Annual 2020© (we do not have any money). Any typos, double spaces or ‘mistakes’ in The Bootleg Annual 2020© are included at no additional charge. If your name is mispelt, The Bootleg Annual 2020© implores you to consider it an anecdote to share with your grandchildren. There will be spelling mistakes (there’s definitely one in this paragraph) and there will be misprints. The Bootleg Annual 2020© suggests readers make a game of trying to find them all. Most expenses were spared in the production of The Bootleg Annual 2020©, making every copy ‘special’. For all its faults, at least The Bootleg Annual 2020© is fully recyclable. Turns out recyclable materials are actually cheaper to use. Who knew? The Bootleg Annual 2020© has the same dimensions as previous annuals, give or take a few centimetres. The Bootleg Annual 2020© is however less robust than previous editions and although the page-thumbing enjoyment of readers is actively encouraged, the ‘chucking about’ of the book is not recommended. The Bootleg Annual 2020© accepts no liability for injuries incurred while throwing books and takes no responsibility for any butterfingered readers. The D&AD font is very nice. However, The Bootleg Annual 2020© could not locate the correct font and opted to stretch Helvetica, as everyone seems to be doing that these days. The typesetting (or lack thereof) seen in The Bootleg Annual 2020© may induce migraines in some designers, art directors or typographers.The Bootleg Annual 2020© is not designed to take business from D&AD, it is an artistic tribute to their organisation with a limited run. It is quite simply a physical memento of the most excellent award-winning work of the year. The Bootleg Annual 2020© will not make any profit. Any surplus funds raised will be donated to charity. No refunds. All sales final.",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>About EMPWRMNT by NATHALIE BALLOUT</h3>
<p>EMPWRMNT by Nathalie Ballout is a global movement conceived by the London-based Swedish-Lebanese Sustainable Fashion Designer.  Challenging the idea of clothing, Nathalie creates upcycled, handcrafted pieces of wearable art, deconstructing and reconstructing pieces – each unique to its owner.  </p>
<p>By combining fashion with a purpose, our long term goal is to create a recognisable brand that becomes synonymous with supporting movements for social and environmental issues across the globe.</p>
<p>We need your help in expanding our reach by becoming an informative outlet and a transformative platform to uplift and empower women and minority communities along its way.  We do not only make beautiful sustainable items, but most importantly we seek to teach something through these items.</p>
<p>With the belief that our struggles do not represent nor define our identities, EMPWRMNT’s mission is to focus on raising the voices of women artisans by celebrating their beautiful craftsmanship and casting a light on their stories. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Lebanon</h3>
<p>Our first project sees as protagonist Alsama Studio, located in the heart of the Bourj al-Barajneh camp in Beirut, Lebanon! The Studio currently employs 24 artisans, particularly Syrian and Palestinian refugee women, as well as Lebanese women living below the poverty line, who create bespoke, hand-made embroidery art.</p>
<p>Most of the women artisans are the sole breadwinners of their extended families.  Moreover, many have received only rudimentary school education and 10% cannot read or write.  Alsama Studio does not only give the women a chance to be financially independent and provide for their families, but it also provides a safe space where they give and receive support.</p>
<p>With transparency at the heart of her collection, Nathalie Ballout has designed a sustainable handbag made from upcycled denim that will be produced in collaboration with the incredible women of Alsama Studio.  On top of producing the handbag, the women will also receive 10% of the profit made from the sales to reinvest however they wish.</p>

<p>With your help we will have the ability to film a documentary on Alsama Studio.  It will take people on a journey to view the process that goes into the creation of each bag whilst shining light on the wonderful artisans that have handcrafted them in an effort to give them new possibilities for the future.  We are confident that by strengthening and sustaining the women of Alsama Studio, their community as a whole will benefit and in turn, be empowered.</p>

<h3>Short Story</h3>
<p>First and foremost, let me say thank you for taking the time to check out our campaign. There are many campaigns out there raising money for a lot of good causes, so the fact that you are looking at ours is greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>A woman’s voice is powerful. If it were not so, culture would not work so hard to silence us. Take the most recent example of Senator Elizabeth Warren, a woman in a position of power, being silenced while attempting to read powerful words from activist and civil rights leader and woman of color, Coretta, Scott King.<br/>Women are silenced in a myriad of ways. As girls, we are rewarded for being polite, sweet, “nice”, which means passive or “don’t rock the boat.” As adults, silencing shows up as interrupting, discounting, minimizing, condescending, “mansplaining”, and even physical abuse or death as in the case of Sandra Bland and too many others like her.<br/>This campaign is important to me because as a white woman and a feminist, I am frustrated that mainstream feminism has prioritized the voices of white, straight, cisgender women over the voices and experiences of women of color and LGBTQ people. It is time we women came together to create a safe space, a real space, where we can engage in honest dialogue about what it is like as a woman to be silenced in our culture and how we collude in that and what we can do to create positive change. This weekend will do that.</p>
<p>Our goal of $1,400 will be divided into seven scholarships for women to attend the weekend, <a href=""http://www.sagesoulsisters.com/sisterhood-of-voices"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Sisterhood of Voices</a>. Although I do all that I can to keep the cost at a minimum, feeding, housing, and facilitating a weekend like this is not cheap. Many women who need it most and whose voices have been silenced do not have the means to attend a weekend like this. Your contributions make it possible. The scholarship only pays a portion of the registration, because I believe it is vitally important for an individual to have a buy-in, to invest something of their own as well. It takes a great measure of commitment. Your contribution builds bridges between these communities of women, creates connection, and promotes healing in a profound and lasting way. These women then carry the impact of the weekend out into the world and into their relationships at home and at work. You are part of this ripple-in-the-pond effect.<br/><br/>The event is <a href=""http://www.sagesoulsisters.com/sisterhood-of-voices"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Sisterhood of Voices</a> which will be held at <a href=""http://bendofivylodge.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Bend of Ivy Lodge</a> in Asheville, NC June 23-26, 2017. It is an extended weekend retreat/workshop for women to explore the power of a woman's voice through an intersectional lens.</p>

<li>$1,400 is the goal. It will create seven $200 scholarships for women to attend the weekend. Any money raised over that amount will be used for travel stipends for women who are traveling from out of state. I have had women travel from as far away as Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Colorado.</li>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Women being silenced in our culture is a real thing. It is insidious and damaging. Since the election, I have seen many people rise up and speak out against injustices in a way I have not seen before. Ebony Washington, when asked why she attended the Women’s March in DC replied, “As a country, I am so proud of women saying: You know what? You don’t get to silence us. You don’t get to speak so vile about us! You don’t get to dismiss us. We’re going to show up in Washington on your inauguration weekend and you are going to hear from us. You can’t silence us! You can’t grab us wherever you want to grab us! You will have to deal with us!” Her words inspire and challenge me. I have felt powerless to have an impact, but chose instead to focus on the areas I <i>can</i> make a difference. All these actions make a difference, yours and mine. We can turn this Titanic a little at a time. Your contribution makes a difference in a woman's life. </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I am well aware that not everyone can make a financial contribution, yet still may want to get involved and support in some way. The best way you can do that is to share this on your social media pages and talk it up with friends. The topic itself can create some interesting and passionate dialogue. Share and keep on sharing. This helps us get the word out. Anything you are willing to do to help us reach our goal is greatly appreciated. </p>
<h3><strong>More About the Weekend</strong></h3>
<p>I have seen it happen again and again. When a white person is called out on their white privilege, especially a woman, the most common reaction is a defensive one. Here’s my take on that, <i>and</i> obviously I speak from a white woman’s perspective and cannot speak for every woman. At the same time, I have been leading women’s retreats and women’s circles since 2007. I have heard countless women share about this topic and how it shows up in their lives. I believe the defensive reaction is an indication of the Good Girl Archetype at play. Women are programmed from a very young age to be nice, sweet, passive, never hurt other’s feelings, don’t upset anyone, etc. I believe most white women want the divide between them and women of color to be mended with a sort of Good Girl “Kumbaya” experience, all neat and tidy and “love trumps hate”. But love, real love, is not all glimmering candles and increase. We cannot celebrate the birth of the new without grieving the loss of what must die. In relationship, Lady Death always has her share.<br/>I see it as similar to birthing a baby. Certainly birth is a beautiful and joyous event. AND, it is also messy and painful and in many ways, not-beautiful. Mending the divide between women of color and white women or other marginalized peoples will require both the beautiful and the not-beautiful.</p>
<p>Sisterhood of Voices calls women to bring all of who they are including the not-beautiful aspects of being a fleshy, fallible human. When a person is willing to show up and be seen, really seen, extraordinary things happen. Courage happens. Compassion happens. Healing happens.</p>
<p>Come and bring your courage, your willingness to be vulnerable, to be seen. Bring all of your feelings. Bring your anger, your sadness, your joy, your shame, and your love. ALL of you is welcome here. This means it will get messy.</p>
<p>Most women I know, myself included, are afraid of anger. As a white woman, I would go so far as to say many white women are afraid of women of color when they express anger. We even have the well-known, derogatory term in our culture, “Angry Black Woman”. How can a woman of color ever feel she can express her true human feelings if she is silenced by the label of “Angry Black Woman”?</p>
<p>From a misguided experience as a little girl, I came to believe that a person could not be angry with me and love me at the same time. That belief made both expressing anger and seeing anger very tricky. This weekend will be structured in such a way as to identify personal triggers and to practice mirroring and dialogue in order to validate a person’s experience and have them feel heard. We will set up ground rules and co-create safe space together.</p>
<p>The goal is real, honest, vulnerable dialogue. Clean, clear, direct, tell-the-truth-faster dialogue, because this is what needs to happen in order to facilitate healing.<br/>Are you a woman who values courage? Are you willing to be vulnerable? Are you curious about and open to your own shadow aspects? Are you willing to be seen, really seen, in order that you might be more embracing of the not-beautiful within you? If so then this weekend calls you, implores you, to join us. Together we can be the women that change the world.<br/>Web page: <a href=""http://www.sagesoulsisters.com/sisterhood-of-voices"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.sagesoulsisters.com/sisterhood-of-vo...</a></p>

<ul>
<li>The internet has brought us closer to our favorite creators but the opportunities of sharing experience with them are still limited. Even for those who can't make it to Anime Expo, I want this to be a experience we can all cherish on.</li>
<li>This campaign is intended to fun completely on effort by the fans but we may have some support by companies such as delivery into Anime Expo.</li>
<li>This is a last minute campaign so I plan to end the campaign at July 1st PST time to order the flowers and message package ready.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Giving Flower Tribute to Mari Okada</h3>
<p>Mari Okada will be attending Anime Expo that takes place in Los Angeles, CA, USA, during July 4-8th and they are hosting US Premiere of Maquia: When The Promised Flower Blooms on July 6th. If we fans can all contribute to get a bouquet of flowers to give to her to show our love.</p>

</div></div>","About This Project
Mari Okada is one of the remarkable creators in modern Japanese animation and created shows such as Hisone and Masotan, The Lost Village, Kiznaiver, Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron Blooded Orphens, The Anthem of the Heart, anohana: The Flower We Saw That Day, and many more. Maquia: When The Promised Flower Blooms will be her step up from a writer to anime director and I wanted to take this opportunity to show her how much her shows means to us around the world.

The internet has brought us closer to our favorite creators but the opportunities of sharing experience with them are still limited. Even for those who can't make it to Anime Expo, I want this to be a experience we can all cherish on.
This campaign is intended to fun completely on effort by the fans but we may have some support by companies such as delivery into Anime Expo.
This is a last minute campaign so I plan to end the campaign at July 1st PST time to order the flowers and message package ready.


Giving Flower Tribute to Mari Okada
Mari Okada will be attending Anime Expo that takes place in Los Angeles, CA, USA, during July 4-8th and they are hosting US Premiere of Maquia: When The Promised Flower Blooms on July 6th. If we fans can all contribute to get a bouquet of flowers to give to her to show our love.
This campaign is designed for each person to contribute one (1) stem of flower.
What will be given to Mari Okada:

One (1) bouquet of flower

One (1) message board with all the thoughtful messages from participants.
Also if we meet stretch goals, flower spray stands will be added.

Photo of Mari Okada:
​
Bouquet of flowers Sample :

Color Theme of blue and white, basing off of Maquia's common colors
Following image is a sample. The actual bouquet will vary


Who Can Participate?
The Campaign is designed so that anyone who is a fan of Mari Okada can participate, any where in the world, that can make payment to indiegogo. There is no territorial restriction that is set in this campaign.
Perks
For perks, I have simply set two types of perks:


Flower Perk: Contribute 1 flower and give a thoughtful message to Mari Okada. 

Flower & Token Perk: In addition to Flower Perk, you will get a post card that is the replica of the message board as a token in participating in this campaign.

Goals and Stretch Goals
The more the flower, the greater the appreciation. The more we can arrange flowers, the more we can show Mari Okada how big of a impact she is creating in the world. Due to nature of flower arrangements, there may be anomaly in number of actual flowers tributs.

​Initial Goal: $300: (60 People Participating)
1 x 60 flowers for the bouquet
1 x Message Board (Board format)
The indiegogo campaign min goal can be set only to $500 so the page says 500 but flexible funding so as long as $300 is there these things are accomplishable.



Stretch Goal 1: $400: (80 People Participating)
1 x 40 Flowers for bouquet
1 x 40 Flowers for Flower Spray Stand (Costs between 
1 x Message Board (Poster Format)



Stretch Goal 2: $600 (120 People Participating)
1 x 40 Flowers for bouquet
2 x 40 Flowers for Flower Spray Stand (Costs between 
1 x Message Board (Poster Format)



Stretch Goal 3: $800 (160 People Participating)
1 x 40 Flowers for bouquet
3 x 40 Flowers for Flower Spray Stand (Costs between 
1 x Message Board (Binded Booklet Format)


Stretch Goal Every $200, 1 Flower Spray Stand will be added.

Ultimate Goal: $4400​​
1 x 40 Flowers for bouquet
21 x 40 Flowers for Flower Spray Stand (Costs between 
1 x Message Board (Binded Booklet Format)



In case of insufficient fund: It's sad that it wont be as impactful but we can still give her a small bouquet with what everyone has contributed. The message board quality may have to downgrade to a nice looking paper.

Flower Spray Stand Sample:

Flower Stand Color Theme is open to suggestions but currently considering blue and white that is similar to the common color found in Maquia.
Following image is a sample. The actual bouquet will vary


Message Board and Postcard Token Sample:
Message Board given to Mari Okada will have the campaign name in the middle and everyone's message edited into he surrounding of it. The Message board below is a sample image and the dimension may change due to need. Poster Cards will have a additional thank you message in the bottom.

 

After Crowdfund: Handing off the flowers & Report

<h3>The WHY</h3>
<p>The Festival Team is comprised of local artists, entrepreneurs and neighbourhood residents. We recognize that neighbourhoods are in constant change, but that shouldn't result in quality of living being side lined. Communities are stronger together, so providing a platform that people can engage in is what the festival aims to be.</p>
<ul>
<li>Since 2007 we've presented participatory art projects, a music stage supporting emerging talents and an affordable market place for over 100 local vendors.</li>
<li>In 2018 we provided paying opportunities to over 100 local artists! </li>
<li>We encourage engagement with Bloordale Store fronts, with free spaces, games and programs.</li>
</ul>
<p>We do not accept funds from large corporations that do not align with our mandate. With government grants struggling, we really do need your help and contributions to ensure we can still provide a platform for community building and allow local artists to present works to the public.</p>

<h3>Art Programming is the Goal</h3>
<ul>
<li>There is a minimum amount required to produce a street festival (rentals, staff, police, street closure, permits, etc) and all available funds <i>after</i> that allow us to program musicians and artists</li>
<li>Through grants and the generous support of the Bloordale BIA we have met our infrastructure goals, but that has left our programming budget dry.</li>
<li>We need your help to reach our goal of $15,000 to program our music stage and site-based art installations. This goal is scalable, so if it is not fully successful, we will proceed with programming on a smaller scale, or reduced amount of projects.</li>
<li>Our perks are thanks to our incredible community, with offerings ranging from private gallery dinners, tour guides, merchandise to art prints!</li>

<h3>The Community Impact</h3>

<p><strong>A Little SOMA History</strong></p>
<p>San Francisco's South of Market Area was known for its rich cultural diversity. It is the home to one of California's largest Filipino/a communities. On April 19, 2016 San Francisco's Board of Supervisors unanimously passed legislation zoning out a large area of land in San Francisco's SOMA (South of Market) neighborhood encompassing a wide variety of buildings, parks, and community service groups that have served the Filipino community for decades</p>
<p>Today, SOMA is home to sky rises, tech companies, and new condos. Unfortunately, development without community consciousness is turning the neighborhood into a sea of sameness and displacing the people that turned an industrial wasteland into a vibrant neighborhood to raise a family and live the American Dream for all.</p>
<p><strong>UNDISCOVERED is one of the ways we are looking help the residents of the SOMA Pilipinas District and protect San Francisco's greatest asset - Diversity.</strong></p>
<p>UNDISCOVERED is part of a broader innovative plan to build a vibrant new commercial corridor in the cultural district, strengthen fledgling entrepreneurs, and create new workforce opportunities for SOMA residents.

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We've been planning this event for nearly a year and assembled an A-team of professional event producers, music &amp; retail curators, marketers, and community stakeholders to bring the event to this point. The City of San Francisco and Mayor Ed Lee have graciously given us $130,000 in grants to seed the project and give it a solid financial foundation. We're turning to you for the last $65,000 to make this event a success and FREE and low cost to our vendors. <br/><br/>In the event we don't raise the $65,000 we are seeking, we will scale back the event in terms of the caliber and number of artists we book, the operating hours, the number of rooms we program in the Old Mint, and the overall production to match our budget capacity. We will also look at ways to charge a nominal door cover and increase booth fees to our vendors (we really don't want to do this).</p>
<h3>Event Budget</h3>
<p>In the tradition of transparency, below is our annual event budget. To start UNDSCVRD there are ~$27,000 in upfront equipment purchases (tents, a/v, decor, etc). Our 1st event will cost $61,000. Every month it costs about $34,000 to produce an UNDSCVRD night market. Outside of our grants and a successful crowdfunding campaign, our other source of revenue are booth fees &amp; revenue share with our vendors, door donations, and corporate sponsorships.</p>

<h3>Bears walking down the streets, vodka, the Kremlin and matryoshkas is all that comes to your mind when you hear the word ""Russia""? Then you're in for a big surprise as our international group is going to explore Siberia and the Far East of Russia by train!</h3>
<p>We are organizing a brave multinational endevour in order to put the stereotypes associated with Russia to the test and bring up social and intercultural issues in the five regions of Siberia we visit.</p>
<p>We are an international group of travelers from all over the world, gearing up for an unforgettable Trans-Siberian trip through the Asian part of Russia, and you can help us turn it into a full-fledged documentary!

<h3>Why is it challenging?</h3>
<p>The two-week train trip will put our endurance to the test. Leave alone the long-haul flights to and from Siberia! The toughest part is that all in all we'll spend more than 3 days on the trains which have:</p>
<ul>
<li>no electricity</li>
<li>no Internet </li>
<li>no phone connection</li>
<li>no air conditioning (plus, windows are often stuck)</li>
<li>not even a shower!</li>
</ul>

<p>As we go, we will capture every step of the way, talk to local people and fellow travelers, share our various impressions from the perspective of our own culture and even contact radio and TV stations to talk about our experiences.

<p>With your help and support, despite ""camera-unfriendly"" conditions on Russian trains, we will do our best to record our journey in a good quality and organize a trip to remote yet mindblowing places like cosmodrome Vostochny, magnificent Zeya and Khingan Nature Reserve (we might see some bears in the wild!) and even get to touch dinosaur bones! </p>
<p>If we manage to meet our campaign goal, we will invest even more effort, time and skills into creating a solid documentary.

<h3>Why make this trip?</h3>
<p><i>Hi! </i></p>
<p><i>I'm Tatiana and I come from the Faaar East of Russia, 8000 km from Moscow, on the Russian-Chinese border, where I lived for 24 years before moving to Europe. And everywhere I went people were excited to hear about life in Siberia and asked me all sorts of questions from a jaw-dropping ""Do you even have electricity there?"" to a more common ""Is life different there from life in Europe?""</i></p>
<p><i>I used to answer from my own, Far-Eastern perspective, but how do I know what reactions and impressions my international friends would have? The idea of travelling through Siberia and sharing our thoughts was so breathtaking that we made a 15-day plan to visit 5 regions of Russia, commuting by train. </i></p>
<p><i>We'll be living, walking, visiting places together for two weeks but even though we hit the same spots as a group, it is something we haven't seen anywhere before: travelers from Spain, Italy, Venezuela, Malta, Russia etc. are coming together to fly more than 11,000 km by plane and travel more than 3,100 km by train to compare their perception of Russian people and lifestyles with each other and with the world. Help us make it happen!</i></p>
<p><i>Yours,</i></p>
<p><i>Tatiana</i></p>
<p><i>Trans-Siberian Trip leader</i></p>
<h3>Why watch the documentary?</h3>
<p>1) A big challenge of this trip is that our international group of travelers will spend two weeks in the cities where practically no one can speak even basic English. Though we, Tatiana and Alex, are Russian natives, the rest of our group are from far and exotic places with zero knowledge of Russian. Let's see how they get by without it or maybe pick up some survival Russian on the way!</p>
<p>Therefore, our trip and a follow-up documentary might be launchpad for research in intercultural communication. </p>
<p>2) The international perspective will not only help capture the beauties of that region but also uncover the country's weak spots and collect ideas for improving living conditions there. On the way, we will be interviewing not only local Russian people but also to foreigners living there in order to build a multi-faceted picture what it's like to live in Siberia and the Far East. </p>
<p>So, our observations will provide food for thought on economical, cultural and integration issues and help draw the Russian state's and international attention to those regions.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There aren't many risks on the way when it comes to the travelling itself. When it comes to filming, one challenge is ensuring the safety of our video equipment, as travelling in public (not private) compartments involves some risks. But we will take all necessary measures to ensure the safety of our belongings.</p>
<p>Another challenge while on the long-distance train is no supply or very limited supply of electricity, but we'll do our best to film videos one way or another, even on two-day train journeys. </p>
<p>For legal reasons we are stating that we will do whatever is needed on our side to provide you with the rewards listed in this campaign, but we are not responsible for timely delivery and other delivery-related issues, which are not under our control.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't contribute or participate in the trip yourself, there is still a way to help us make it happen:</p>
<ul>
<li>repost our campaign on your Facebook, Twitter, VK page, etc. - this might help us make a noise about the trip and attract potential contributors;</li>

</div></div>","Bears walking down the streets, vodka, the Kremlin and matryoshkas is all that comes to your mind when you hear the word ""Russia""? Then you're in for a big surprise as our international group is going to explore Siberia and the Far East of Russia by train!
We are organizing a brave multinational endevour in order to put the stereotypes associated with Russia to the test and bring up social and intercultural issues in the five regions of Siberia we visit.
We are an international group of travelers from all over the world, gearing up for an unforgettable Trans-Siberian trip through the Asian part of Russia, and you can help us turn it into a full-fledged documentary! For 15 days we'll be exploring the main towns of mesmerizing Siberia, from Baikal lake to the farthest corners of the Far East of Russia.

Why is it challenging?
The two-week train trip will put our endurance to the test. Leave alone the long-haul flights to and from Siberia! The toughest part is that all in all we'll spend more than 3 days on the trains which have:

no electricity
no Internet 
no phone connection
no air conditioning (plus, windows are often stuck)
not even a shower!


As we go, we will capture every step of the way, talk to local people and fellow travelers, share our various impressions from the perspective of our own culture and even contact radio and TV stations to talk about our experiences. We'll be recording and posting videos in a multicultural blog, taking you with us on the journey and then follow up the trip with a 90-min documentary that you can be a part of!

<h3>The Cause</h3>
<p>2018 marks the 140th anniversary of the birth of Irish architect and designer, Eileen Gray. She established a reputation as one the most avant-garde and inventive designers in Paris, and continued to design furniture until until her death, aged 98.</p>
<p>Without any formal architectural training (and with the help of fellow architect Jean Badovici) she designed and built a house on the shores of the Mediterranean in Roquebrune-Cap-Martin between 1926 and 1929. </p>
<p>Eileen moved out of E-1027 in 1932 and over the years the house fell into disrepair. The walls of the villa were used as target practice by German soldiers in WW2 and it was the site of a murder in the 1990s. The house was eventually rescued by the Conservatoire du Littoral (the French version of the National Trust) and in 2014, the non-for-profit Association Cap Moderne was set up in order to protect, preserve and restore E-1027 and its associated buildings.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1539703001/p3ismmic6ua53dlwo87m.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><i>E-1027 was in a terrible state of disrepair (c) Tim Benton</i></p>

The site became open to the public in 2015. </p>
<p><strong>However there is still much work to be done.</strong></p>
<p>Over the next two years Cap Moderne hope to recreate all of Eileen's fixed and free-standing furnishings inside the villa, using her original materials and methods. Importantly, we also aim to provide disabled access to the villa, so everyone is able to experience the magic of E-1027. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1535972559/vedavxq2kbqloxrenkok.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><i>Disabled access is a challenge at E-1027 (c) Manuel Bougot</i></p>
<h3>How you can help us</h3>
<p>The quest of Cap Moderne, with your help, is to raise €55,000 to recreate Eileen’s fixed and free-standing furnishings <strong>in the dining alcove</strong> <strong>and bar </strong>of E-1027. We also hope to put a portion of the funds towards providing <strong>disabled access to the site</strong>.</p>
<p>Eileen designed the villa as a place where Jean Badovici could entertain his friends. In the dining alcove Jean would prepare cocktails and socialise with his guests. Sadly none of the original furnishings remain in this part of the villa, and all that is left is one of Le Corbusier's colourful murals. It is our hope to recreate this beautiful area in memory of Eileen's great genius and verve for life. </p>

<p>Important pieces in the dining alcove include an ingenious foldable table that when opened transforms the corridor into a bar. While Jean was preparing his cocktails he could turn around and select a Menton lemon to slice from a specially made lemon container affixed to the wall. Genius!</p>

<h3>Eileen Gray: a<strong> female architect in a man’s world</strong>
</h3>
<p>A pioneer of the Modernist Movement, Eileen Gray’s contribution to both architecture and furniture design are on par with many of the greats, including contemporary, Le Corbusier.</p>
<p>She was born in Enniscorthy in County Wexford, Ireland, in 1878 to an aristocratic mother and artist father. She studied at the Slade School of Fine Art, where she had her first introduction to lacquering. Aged 24 she moved to Paris to continue her design education, and for many years quietly and determinedly began designing her modernist furniture. There, Eileen became involved in the Bohemian circles of the time, and was able to explore her bisexuality, in an era of sexual conservatism.</p>

</div></div>","The Cause
2018 marks the 140th anniversary of the birth of Irish architect and designer, Eileen Gray. She established a reputation as one the most avant-garde and inventive designers in Paris, and continued to design furniture until until her death, aged 98.
Without any formal architectural training (and with the help of fellow architect Jean Badovici) she designed and built a house on the shores of the Mediterranean in Roquebrune-Cap-Martin between 1926 and 1929. 
Eileen moved out of E-1027 in 1932 and over the years the house fell into disrepair. The walls of the villa were used as target practice by German soldiers in WW2 and it was the site of a murder in the 1990s. The house was eventually rescued by the Conservatoire du Littoral (the French version of the National Trust) and in 2014, the non-for-profit Association Cap Moderne was set up in order to protect, preserve and restore E-1027 and its associated buildings.

E-1027 was in a terrible state of disrepair (c) Tim Benton
Thanks to tireless work by Cap Moderne, the Conservatoire du Littoral and the New York based Friends of e.1027, all essential structural work of the villa has now been completed. The site became open to the public in 2015. 
However there is still much work to be done.
Over the next two years Cap Moderne hope to recreate all of Eileen's fixed and free-standing furnishings inside the villa, using her original materials and methods. Importantly, we also aim to provide disabled access to the villa, so everyone is able to experience the magic of E-1027. 

Disabled access is a challenge at E-1027 (c) Manuel Bougot
How you can help us
The quest of Cap Moderne, with your help, is to raise €55,000 to recreate Eileen’s fixed and free-standing furnishings in the dining alcove and bar of E-1027. We also hope to put a portion of the funds towards providing disabled access to the site.
Eileen designed the villa as a place where Jean Badovici could entertain his friends. In the dining alcove Jean would prepare cocktails and socialise with his guests. Sadly none of the original furnishings remain in this part of the villa, and all that is left is one of Le Corbusier's colourful murals. It is our hope to recreate this beautiful area in memory of Eileen's great genius and verve for life. 

The dining alcove as it currently looks (c) Lucy Woods
Important pieces in the dining alcove include an ingenious foldable table that when opened transforms the corridor into a bar. While Jean was preparing his cocktails he could turn around and select a Menton lemon to slice from a specially made lemon container affixed to the wall. Genius!
All donations to the crowdfunding will be matched by the French state. If you can help us raise €55,000, this means €110,000 will go towards our project.  And if we raise more it will enable us to recreate other key pieces. 
Thank you for your help.

<h3><u><strong>First up: Restoring the Red Car!</strong></u></h3>
<p>The centerpiece of the Venice Heritage Museum will be a renovated<strong> Pacific Electric Red Car trolley </strong>generously donated to us by the Orange Empire Railway Museum.

<p>Phase II of the campus will introduce a Venice bungalow donated to us by our architect, David Hertz and his Studio for Environmental Architecture. The bungalow will be renovated to replicate <strong>the original 'Tokio Station' ticketing booth on Venice Blvd </strong>(pictured above) that once served passengers right in front of the original Venice City Hall.  The building will provide exhibition and archival space for our Venice collection, as well as meeting space for the community.</p>
<h3>In order to secure the lease to Venice-of-America Centennial Park and install our original 1905 Pacific Electric Red Car trolley at the park, we need to raise enough funds to cover Phase 1 of our business plan: $115,000. </h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Moving the Red Car out of its current location at the Orange Empire Railway Museum in Perris, CA to a restoration site closer to Venice</p></li>
<li><p>Paying for rent, maintenance, and insurance at the temporary site</p></li>
<li><p>Professionally detoxing and restoring the Red Car to its original glory</p></li>
<li><p>Prepping the park site and moving the Red Car into Centennial Park once the exterior renovation is complete, where we will finish the interior restoration onsite (included in Phase 2)</p></li>
<li><p>Paying a professional grant writer to pursue additional funding opportunities for the project and hosting fundraising events</p></li>

</div></div>","The Venice Heritage Museum is an opportunity to share and preserve over a century's worth of stories, collections, and archives from one of America’s most legendary cities.
Our museum campus will serve as a common ground for all of Venice's residents and visitors, located in Venice of America Centennial Park immediately west of Abbot Kinney Blvd and adjacent to the Venice-Abbot Kinney Memorial Branch Library along the gateway to Venice.
At 3.4 square miles, Venice, California is a small town with an impossibly large footprint on the world.
For more than 100 years, Venice has been a multi-cultural mecca for creativity, diversity, and personal expression. However, in this time of rapid change, the people, stories, and events that have made Venice, California a global destination are at risk of being forgotten.

First up: Restoring the Red Car!
The centerpiece of the Venice Heritage Museum will be a renovated Pacific Electric Red Car trolley generously donated to us by the Orange Empire Railway Museum. The Red Car will serve as the main location for the museum's seasonal exhibits celebrating the many facets of Venice's diverse history, showcased through our vast collections and virtual displays. 

Phase II of the campus will introduce a Venice bungalow donated to us by our architect, David Hertz and his Studio for Environmental Architecture. The bungalow will be renovated to replicate the original 'Tokio Station' ticketing booth on Venice Blvd (pictured above) that once served passengers right in front of the original Venice City Hall.  The building will provide exhibition and archival space for our Venice collection, as well as meeting space for the community.
In order to secure the lease to Venice-of-America Centennial Park and install our original 1905 Pacific Electric Red Car trolley at the park, we need to raise enough funds to cover Phase 1 of our business plan: $115,000. 

Phase 1 funding will cover the expenses for:

Moving the Red Car out of its current location at the Orange Empire Railway Museum in Perris, CA to a restoration site closer to Venice
Paying for rent, maintenance, and insurance at the temporary site
Professionally detoxing and restoring the Red Car to its original glory
Prepping the park site and moving the Red Car into Centennial Park once the exterior renovation is complete, where we will finish the interior restoration onsite (included in Phase 2)
Paying a professional grant writer to pursue additional funding opportunities for the project and hosting fundraising events
Partially funding Phase 2 of the project to demonstrate to the City of Los Angeles Department Recreation & Parks that we have adequate funds to maintain the operations of the project onsite as we continue our fundraising efforts
= $115,000 TOTAL


 
Projected Phase I Opening: SUMMER 2023

The Museum Campus
In addition to the Red Car and Tokio Station exhibit spaces, the Venice Heritage Museum campus will also feature a Community Corner stage in the southwest corner of the park. The Community Corner is intended to be a town square where everyone is welcome to gather.
We intend to provide a space for Venice residents and visitors to come together for events, live music, film nights, classes and more (as it becomes safe to do so again). 

Pictured above: Tongva elder, Angie Behrns, leading a closing ceremony at our exhibition, ""A History of Venice"", with the Venice Institute of Contemporary Art at Beyond Baroque, September 2019.
Whether you are an Artist, Business Owner, Community Organizer, Craftsman, Dancer, Entrepreneur, Fashion Designer, Filmmaker, Musician, Philanthropist, Restaurateur, Storyteller (or too many more to list), this is a place for you.
The Community Corner will also serve as an affordable rental space for guest events, providing an additional source of revenue to support the museum's operations. Lastly, we will have strict noise regulations in place in consideration of nearby neighbors and will ensure the utmost safety of our guests while events are underway.

Pictured above: VHF Board President and retired 35+ year Venice High School shop teacher, Grant Francis (""Mr. Francis""), sharing our project with the community.
Rounding out the Venice Heritage Museum campus, our Information Booth will serve as the first stop for visitors to explore Venice businesses, learn about our history, and obtain a wide array of recommendations only locals can provide in collaboration with the Venice Chamber of Commerce and Venice Neighborhood Council.
If you are a business down an alley, around a corner, or working out of your home, we want to help the community find you! Each month, we will feature a different local small business or maker, working on the ground in the community to ensure that all who might be interested are aware of the opportunity.
About Us: The Venice Heritage Foundation
We founded the Venice Heritage Foundation, a 501c3 non-profit organization, specifically for the purpose of building the first-ever history museum for Venice!
We are a broad-based group of volunteers, big in heart and community spirit, and dedicated to serving the needs of the greater Venice community. 

Pictured above (L-R): 3rd generation Venetian and artist, Takara Tomeoni Adair, talking about our project with a guest at the ""A History of Venice"" opening reception; Retired Venice High School teacher and Venice High School Alumni Association leader, Grant Francis, at a presentation of our project for the Playa Venice Sunrise Rotary; Venice native, advocate, and project manager, Kristina von Hoffmann, representing the Museum at the USC Archives Bazaar.
Our multigenerational Board of Directors is composed of born and raised Venetians, historians, educators, event planners, and other creative types who all share a passion for the preservation of Venice history, past and present.
Our overarching mission is to create an inclusive museum that preserves, showcases, and nurtures Venice’s historical legacy. 
We aim to establish a public campus that enriches the lives of current and future generations of Venetians and visitors through exhibitions, events, and activities hosted onsite, improving the present with the past.
Our organization and members have contributed to the celebration and preservation of Venice culture for years.

We've helped produce events such as the revival Venice Mardi Gras and Neptune Festival parades.
We've put on exhibitions like the month-long ""A History of Venice"" exhibition—a retrospective of Venice history in eleven parts curated by and for the community, in partnership with the Venice Institute of Contemporary Art and Venice literary arts landmark, Beyond Baroque. We've also assisted long-time local businesses such as Hoagies and Hama Sushi to share a slice of Venice history with their patrons by lending out historic posters, images, and memorabilia.

We're up for the task. However, this project is an all-hands-on-deck effort. Venice's incredible history hangs in the balance unless we unite to make the museum a reality.

 
Join us at this pivotal moment to ensure that Venice's full legacy lives on for generations to come!

Venice's Legacy
Abbot Kinney's Venice-of-America. Slum By The Sea. Dogtown. Silicon Beach. 
Over the past 115+ years, Venice has earned a wide array of nicknames that parallel its unique and wide-ranging history.
Originally an amusement park for wealthy Angelenos, it developed into a haven for diverse, working-class people—including Black pioneers leaving the Jim Crow south, first and second-generation Mexican-American, Central-American, and Indigenous families, farmers and entrepreneurs of Japanese ancestry, and European Jewish refugees amongst others, all in search of economic opportunities and a better quality of life.
With a depressed economy and cheap rent following years of disinvestment post-WWII, Venice became an enclave for countercultural Beat poets and renegade political activists, spawning such movements as the Peace & Freedom Party and the region's only printing press in support of the Vietnam Resistance. Trailblazing artists such as Larry Bell, Fred Eversley, and Lita Albuquerque were drawn to Venice's beautiful light and large, affordable studio spaces by the beach.
The city was home to world-renowned design duo, Charles & Ray Eames, for nearly fifty years and it's where influential, cutting-edge architects like Frank Gehry got their start. Once deemed the ""Roller Skating Capital of the World"", Venice put roller dancing and street performance on the map, drawing thousands of tourists to the Boardwalk each year. The legacy of Arnold Schwarzenegger, Gold's Gym, and Muscle Beach have continued to attract the global bodybuilding community to this day.
...not to mention creative icons like Charlie Chaplin, The Doors, and Teena Marie who all got their start in Venice! And this is just the tip of the iceberg. Needless to say, the possibility for creative self-expression is the spirit of Venice. We think it's about time Venice had its own museum to commemorate our city's incredible history, ensuring that these stories are celebrated for generations to come.

<p><strong>Deseas honrar alguien que haya fallecido?  O te gustaría rendir homenaje a alguien que admiraste? El Festival La Calaca le invita a aportar una imagen fija o un video corto para que sea proyectado en un muro exterior en el centro de esta mágica ciudad Patrimonio de la Humanidad durante la semana de  Día de Muertos del 1ro al 4 de noviembre.</strong></p>
<p><strong>HISTORIA</strong><br/><i>Ante la muerte todos somos iguales, todos somos ""Calacas"". Esta es la idea que inspiró el Festival  La Calaca y por eso es gratuita y abierta a toda la comunidad de San Miguel de Allende durante las celebraciones del Día de Muertos.  Para preservar y promover esta hermosa tradición, necesitamos su ayuda!</i></p>
<p><strong>Este monumento comunitario ayudará a reunir los fondos necesarios para producir algunas de las muchas actividades que estamos planeando para el 2017, incluyendo:</strong><br/>• La Pirámide de los Muertos<br/>• Festival de Cortometrajes La Vida Es Corta<br/>• Dead Talks (como las conferencias TED, pero sobre la muerte)<br/>• Catrina EXPO en el Instituto Allende<br/>• Cadena de globos (que involucra a niños de pueblos vecinos que pintan sobre los globos)<br/>• Festival de Arte Urbano (breakdancing, talleres de beatboxing, recorrido mural)<br/>• Visitas guiadas al cementerio por un historiador de renombre<br/>• Guía bilingüe para visitantes y locales de las actividades mencionadas más eventos e instalaciones adicionales producidas por organizaciones alineadas a la misión.</p>
<p><strong>Obviamente no podemos hacer todo lo anterior con $ 5000 usd, pero cuanto más excedamos nuestro modesto objetivo, más actividades y programas podremos ofrecer a la comunidad.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Por qué un Homenaje Público en Video tiene un gran impacto?</strong><br/>Este monumento comunitario conmemorativo en proyección será visto por miles de personas que serán conmovidos y recordarán a sus seres queridos que han fallecido, ya otros a quienes admiraron y respetaron.</p>
<p>Queremos honrar a las víctimas de los terremotos que han sacudido a los espíritus del pueblo mexicano ya la comunidad global. No queremos cargar la ciudad con solicitudes de fondos cuando la financiación es tan escasa a raíz de esta tragedia. La Calaca es conocida por su capacidad de generar recursos, año tras año (fue fundada en 2012) a pesar de los pequeños presupuestos con los que hemos venido trabajando.</p>
<p><strong>Comparte esta campaña con tus amigos!</strong><br/>Cuanta más gente aporte un video o imagen fija en honor a alguien especial, más impactante será la instalación. Y a la vez tendremos más fondos para mover los corazones de la comunidad durante estas profundas fiestas tradicionales, que comienzan a ser reconocidas como una celebración relevante en todo el mundo. Así que, gracias por compartir esta campaña a lo largo y ancho (las herramientas para compartir de Indiegogo lo hacen fácil).

El Festival La Calaca le invita a aportar una imagen fija o un video corto para que sea proyectado en un muro exterior en el centro de esta mágica ciudad Patrimonio de la Humanidad durante la semana de  Día de Muertos del 1ro al 4 de noviembre.
HISTORIAAnte la muerte todos somos iguales, todos somos ""Calacas"". Esta es la idea que inspiró el Festival  La Calaca y por eso es gratuita y abierta a toda la comunidad de San Miguel de Allende durante las celebraciones del Día de Muertos.  Para preservar y promover esta hermosa tradición, necesitamos su ayuda!
Este monumento comunitario ayudará a reunir los fondos necesarios para producir algunas de las muchas actividades que estamos planeando para el 2017, incluyendo:• La Pirámide de los Muertos• Festival de Cortometrajes La Vida Es Corta• Dead Talks (como las conferencias TED, pero sobre la muerte)• Catrina EXPO en el Instituto Allende• Cadena de globos (que involucra a niños de pueblos vecinos que pintan sobre los globos)• Festival de Arte Urbano (breakdancing, talleres de beatboxing, recorrido mural)• Visitas guiadas al cementerio por un historiador de renombre• Guía bilingüe para visitantes y locales de las actividades mencionadas más eventos e instalaciones adicionales producidas por organizaciones alineadas a la misión.
Obviamente no podemos hacer todo lo anterior con $ 5000 usd, pero cuanto más excedamos nuestro modesto objetivo, más actividades y programas podremos ofrecer a la comunidad.
Por qué un Homenaje Público en Video tiene un gran impacto?Este monumento comunitario conmemorativo en proyección será visto por miles de personas que serán conmovidos y recordarán a sus seres queridos que han fallecido, ya otros a quienes admiraron y respetaron.
Queremos honrar a las víctimas de los terremotos que han sacudido a los espíritus del pueblo mexicano ya la comunidad global. No queremos cargar la ciudad con solicitudes de fondos cuando la financiación es tan escasa a raíz de esta tragedia. La Calaca es conocida por su capacidad de generar recursos, año tras año (fue fundada en 2012) a pesar de los pequeños presupuestos con los que hemos venido trabajando.
Comparte esta campaña con tus amigos!Cuanta más gente aporte un video o imagen fija en honor a alguien especial, más impactante será la instalación. Y a la vez tendremos más fondos para mover los corazones de la comunidad durante estas profundas fiestas tradicionales, que comienzan a ser reconocidas como una celebración relevante en todo el mundo. Así que, gracias por compartir esta campaña a lo largo y ancho (las herramientas para compartir de Indiegogo lo hacen fácil). Se siente bien honrar a la gente que nos importa, y amplificar cuan impactantes fueron estas personas en nuestras vidas de una manera hermosa y colaborativa, en una de las ciudades más magníficas del mundo.
Ándale Calaca!

<p>Početkom godine osnovali smo udrugu Krapinjon čiji fokus će biti na istoimenom festivalu, no uz to će organizirati i razne druge događaje tokom cijele godine. S obzirom na nemogućnost prijavljivanja na razne natječaje za udruge, odlučili smo financijsku pomoć potražiti na drugim mjestima, a jedno od njih je i Indiegogo platforma.</p>
<p><i><strong>At the start of the year we founded the Krapinjon association, whose focus will be on the festival of the same name, but will also organize various other events throughout the year. Given the inability to apply for a variety of biddings intended for associations, we decided to look for financial help in other places, one of them being the Indiegogo platform.​</strong></i></p>

<p>Ove godine već smo uspješno realizirali dva oslikavanja murala u Krapini - prvi nosi naziv ""Imaginarni putevi"" i djelo je mlade umjetnice iz Krapine Ivane Bajcer, a drugi je djelo Vedrana Štimca iz Pule (Polite BastArt) i na specifičan način prikazuje poznatog filozofa Herberta Marcusea i njegovo najpoznatije djelo ""Jednodimenzionalni čovjek"". U planu za ovu godinu je obogatiti Krapinu s još barem dva nova murala, a u tome će sudjelovati mladi i perspektivni umjetnici iz Krapine, ali i cijele Hrvatske.</p>
<p><i><strong>This year we have successfully completed two street-art projects in Krapina - the first is called ""Imaginary Paths"" and is a work of a young artist from Krapina, Ivana Bajcer, and the other is a work by Vedran Štimac from Pula (Polite BastArt) and it shows, in a specific way,  the famous philosopher Herbert Marcuse and his most famous work ""One-dimensional man"". This year's plan is to enrich Krapina with at least two new murals, made by young and perspective artists from Krapina and various places throughout Croatia.</strong></i></p>

<p>Ponovno je ostvarena suradnja s krapinskim Foto klubom  i u petak će upravo oni otvoriti festival svojom izložbom svjetlosnih okvira. Predavanje Nikole Horvata o njegovoj 4300 kilometara dugoj Pacific Crest Trail avanturi zasigurno će privući brojne ljubitelje planinarenja i avanturističkog načina života, a već prvog dana očekuje nas i koncert mladih neafirmiranih bendova među koje su se ugurali i pobjednici ovogodišnjeg HGF festivala - Lika Kolorado. Novitet na festivalu je Guitar show natjecanje koje je prvenstveno zamišljeno kao druženje glazbenika uz sviranje, no za pobjednike su osigurane vrijedne nagrade tako da očekujemo i žestoku borbu iskazanu u gitarističkom umijeću.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><strong>Your contribution will help us sustain our dynamic programming and keep the event free of corporate sponsorship. </strong>Pittonkatonk is a grass-roots, volunteer-run social and environmental justice organization that promotes creativity and critical thought by way of music making and participatory events in and around the Pittsburgh Area. The annual Brass BBQ, held the first Saturday of May, encourages participants to engage in making the event happen through bringing shared food dishes, volunteering to run the event, hosting traveling musicians, promoting the event, and performance.</p>

<li>Pittonkatonk has continued to evolve, not only as a <strong>showcase for world music</strong>, but also as a <strong>platform for artists and organizations to connect</strong> and celebrate their shared missions to a diverse audience of 5,000+ attendees.

NO TICKET PRICE!
POTLUCK!
An event about the people, for the people.

Pittonkatonk is celebrating its 5th year! We need your support to make it happen.

Pittonkatonk is a grassroots volunteer-run community event for all ages featuring local and national activist bands.
We're excited to announce a diverse lineup featuring bands from Niger and Latin America, and from several US cities in addition to Pittsburgh, including Providence, Detroit, Chicago, Washington, DC, and Toledo, OH.
New this year! We'll have a Community Resource Tent highlighting social and environmental justice organizations working in the Pittsburgh area.
We also run the Pittonkatonk Education Program (PEP) for youth in under-served communities.

It's important for us to run this campaign to help cover costs of the event (totaling $20,000). Without your donations we cannot make Pittonkatonk happen.
Community-owned means we need your buy-in.


What We Need & What You Get
Breaking down what we need:

We need $20,000 to make this incredible day in the park happen. This includes permits, space rental, band fees, porta potties, security, insurance, promotion, and food.
Band fees and stipends cost $10,000. All the rest costs about $5,000-10,000.
If we don't reach our goal, our organizers are responsible for it personally.

As a supporter, you get...
Music! A community resource tent! The biggest potluck ever!

There are ways of learning we do not know and they can be important windows to the self. The apprentice system as found in Japan is very much a values-based education system centered on the person, versus our skills-based training with its commitment to efficiency. Deeply rooted in Japanese culture, craft apprenticeship shares many elements of Zen Buddhist monastic training, such as humility, fealty to one’s teacher, repetition, and training in silence. It was not efficient; the typical boatbuilding apprenticeship was six years. In my case I worked with each of my teachers for the time it took to build one or two boats, from one to seven months. All of my teachers told me at the outset there would be no speaking in the workshop; the workday was conducted in silence.</p><p>This begs the question: how does one learn in silence? The answer lies in those long apprenticeships. While the apprentice was sweeping, sharpening or fetching tools they were constantly watching their teacher, learning by observation. It may be months or even years, but one day the master would ask the apprentice to do something, and expect them to do it perfectly. As an experienced boatbuilder, I was brought into the work fairly quickly (though my first tool was always the broom). Nevertheless, if I made a mistake, I was sent back to sweeping. I can say it made me a very highly motivated student. While one can fairly raise objections to this sort of “teaching,” it focuses all responsibility for learning on the apprentice.</p><p>I call this values-based learning - as opposed to western skills-based learning - because of the intense demands it places on the learner. It requires the humility to respect one’s teacher; powers of observation to learn every detail of the craft; and the perseverance and patience to painstakingly develop one’s skills. It requires an incredible level of focus and attention. At a glance the process can seem slavishly imitative, but in fact the crucible the apprentice finds him/herself in demands constant attention and creativity. </p><p>I often found myself working alongside my teachers, having been ordered to keep up with them while we chiseled mortises or piloted nail holes. My teachers could cut hundreds of identical mortises without laying out any lines beforehand. I could not. In desperation, so as not to fall behind (the broom was always waiting), I would quickly make little patterns out of scrap so I could trace uniform shapes consistent with their work. It may seem insignificant and hardly revelatory, but it was symptomatic of an intensity I have never found in any other educational setting. It also points to how my teachers made me responsible for every detail of the work, all without saying a word. </p><p>My association with Japan began with the straightforward goal of preserving the skills of traditional boatbuilding. Since then, I have developed a much deeper appreciation for apprenticeship, its crucial role in sustaining the craft, and what it can teach us about learning. This project hopes to do both: nurture a new generation of boatbuilders through cross-cultural exchange, exposing them to lessons both tangible and intangible. </p><p>Looking back, I am deeply indebted to my teachers for humbling me, for making me uncomfortable, forcing me to concentrate.

Do you have a dream to start your own food business?  Want to invest in the newest food brands coming out of South Louisiana’s vibrant culinary culture? Where do you go? </p><p>Acadiana Food Hub!</p><p>Acadiana Food Hub has been a 501c-3 Non -profit since 2016, we are here to serve Acadiana’s rich culinary culture and be the backbone for a growing culinary economy in South Louisiana. We connect local farmers to homes, restaurants, grocers and institutional buyers. Bridging the gap between farmers and markets and helping to keep the cost low so end consumers can afford to support local. We provide commercial kitchen space and equipment to South Louisiana growing culinary entrepreneurs. We do this as a service to support local farmers and our access to the fresh local food they produce.</p><p>It is difficult to be a local farmer in today’s world of mass production and nationwide distribution. The average age of farmers in the United States is 59 years old and only 3% of our population know how to grow food. After working with policy advisors and local civic representatives we learned that Lafayette only has a “2 day fresh food supply”. By supporting local farmers, we can increase this supply, and contribute to our local economy at the same time. </p><p>It is vital to our economy and our food security that we support those local farmers growing food for our communities. </p><p>Acadiana Food Hub has broken down the barriers of farm to table, and created solutions to the difficulties of starting and growing culinary entrepreneurs and our culinary economy, but we need your help to keep it open!</p><p>Over the last two years we have built a new facility to be the home and infrastructure for these needs of the community. We’ve invested our time and energy to give people the opportunity to realize their dreams and provide fresh food to Acadiana.</p><p>As a Lafayette local, the need for economic diversification is apparent. As a 3rd generation Lafayette food distribution entrepreneur, its apparent the community needs these services, and that South Louisiana already has a vibrant culinary culture to capitalize on, economically, as long as it has the facilities to support these operations.</p><p>We are giving the community the opportunity to give their support to this vital facility and services. Please join me in that support, through raising another $20,000 to cover infrastructure cost through the end of the year. </p><p>We would greatly appreciate any funds or contributions to KEEP THE ACADIANA FOOD HUB up and running!</p><p>What We Need &amp; What You Get</p><p>We are hoping to raise $20,000 in order to keep the Acadiana Food Hub open! All funds raised will go directly towards the lease of our facilities. By donating to our campaign, you will be directly supporting all of the programs that Acadiana Food Hub has to offer. Without our facility and infrastructure, we will be unable to continue service to Acadiana’s farmers or support our local food economy.</p><p> </p><p>The Impact</p><p>When you spend $1 at a big supermarket for food that’s grown far away, 80 cents of that dollar leaves your area. That money goes to industrial agriculture, to corporate executives and to oil companies for transportation fuel. The farmer who grew the food might keep 10 to 15 cents of the dollar. </p><p> </p><p>If your dinner has eight ingredients from eight different areas, that food may have traveled thousands of miles, burning oil moving from where it was grown to where you eat it.</p><p> </p><p>But when you spend $1 at a farmers’ market or a locally-sourced restaurant, the money stays in your community. </p><p> </p><p>Local food connects us, it builds local economies and it improves our health!</p><p> </p><p>RISKS AND CHALLENGES</p><p>The risks of not raising the money we need for the Kitchen Incubator is that we fail the hundreds of food entrepreneurs who want to start a business of their own; we fail to create jobs these people will provide; we fail to save new start-ups from launching. The challenges are not finding great partners.</p><p>So far one of the major challenges has been knowledge that these new opportunities exist for local food producers. </p><p>The food incubator model has really grown from virtually very few food/kitchen incubators to about 10 in the last few years.  And why such growth? With the booming demand for specialty and artisan foods, incubators can help hungry Food Entrepreneurs to get started be a success in a licensed kitchen at a fraction of the cost of leasing and building a kitchen of their own. </p><p>Our team understands that the food business is capital intensive and requires a lot of time. We aren't glossing over any of the risks, but ensuring that pooling together resources from different food businesses is the way to go. Between us, we have experience in managing work spaces, restaurants, branding, IT and distribution systems. </p><p>FROM THEN TO NOW</p><p>Initial setup was fairly difficult, and for the first 6 months we focused solely on developing the space and our revenue streams. We finished construction and started to slowly attract new companies to start up in Lafayette while doing outreach to build capacity. Over the past three months we have seen more use of the services and space than the entire first year of operation, showing a clear momentum in the success of the services of the Acadiana Food Hub. We won't only work with low-income and disadvantaged food vendors, but also attract authentic and unique food businesses, who will pay to use the space as a way to bring in income. We will also offer branding and marketing advice to keep us running.  The risk is that enough people won’t use the space in enough time to keep us open. That’s why it’s important that we help to keep these services running as we continue to build capacity of a sustainable non-profit.</p><p>HEAR IT FROM OTHERS</p><p>According to the National Incubation Association, “By mitigating start-up costs and providing a nurturing environment, business incubators have successfully graduated over 87% of their firms and kept an astounding 84% of these thriving businesses within their local communities for years after graduation. The culinary incubator, often referred to as a “shared-use commercial kitchen,” has taken a time-tested successful concept and swapped out office space for kitchens. They have opened to much acclaim, nurtured successful businesses and been embraced by their communities.</p><p> </p><p>Other Ways You Can Help</p><p>We realize everyone can’t contribute financially. So here are a few ways you can help besides donating!</p><p>Spread the word. We want everyone in Acadiana to know what is available.</p><p>We are always looking for volunteers. Consider participating one of our many farm-to-table events.</p><p>Please help us fulfill our dream of preeving a local food hub for everyone. Even if it is just a dollar that you can give we promise we will make the most of it to build this community.</p><p> And if you can't give a dollar but you want to help please TELL ALL YOUR FRIENDS and share a link to our project!<br/> </p><p>Stay Connected with Acadiana Food Hub on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter!</p><p>You can make a difference by choosing local food.

Do you have a dream to start your own food business?  Want to invest in the newest food brands coming out of South Louisiana’s vibrant culinary culture? Where do you go? Acadiana Food Hub!Acadiana Food Hub has been a 501c-3 Non -profit since 2016, we are here to serve Acadiana’s rich culinary culture and be the backbone for a growing culinary economy in South Louisiana. We connect local farmers to homes, restaurants, grocers and institutional buyers. Bridging the gap between farmers and markets and helping to keep the cost low so end consumers can afford to support local. We provide commercial kitchen space and equipment to South Louisiana growing culinary entrepreneurs. We do this as a service to support local farmers and our access to the fresh local food they produce.It is difficult to be a local farmer in today’s world of mass production and nationwide distribution. The average age of farmers in the United States is 59 years old and only 3% of our population know how to grow food. After working with policy advisors and local civic representatives we learned that Lafayette only has a “2 day fresh food supply”. By supporting local farmers, we can increase this supply, and contribute to our local economy at the same time. It is vital to our economy and our food security that we support those local farmers growing food for our communities. Acadiana Food Hub has broken down the barriers of farm to table, and created solutions to the difficulties of starting and growing culinary entrepreneurs and our culinary economy, but we need your help to keep it open!Over the last two years we have built a new facility to be the home and infrastructure for these needs of the community. We’ve invested our time and energy to give people the opportunity to realize their dreams and provide fresh food to Acadiana.As a Lafayette local, the need for economic diversification is apparent. As a 3rd generation Lafayette food distribution entrepreneur, its apparent the community needs these services, and that South Louisiana already has a vibrant culinary culture to capitalize on, economically, as long as it has the facilities to support these operations.We are giving the community the opportunity to give their support to this vital facility and services. Please join me in that support, through raising another $20,000 to cover infrastructure cost through the end of the year. We would greatly appreciate any funds or contributions to KEEP THE ACADIANA FOOD HUB up and running!What We Need & What You GetWe are hoping to raise $20,000 in order to keep the Acadiana Food Hub open! All funds raised will go directly towards the lease of our facilities. By donating to our campaign, you will be directly supporting all of the programs that Acadiana Food Hub has to offer. Without our facility and infrastructure, we will be unable to continue service to Acadiana’s farmers or support our local food economy. The ImpactWhen you spend $1 at a big supermarket for food that’s grown far away, 80 cents of that dollar leaves your area. That money goes to industrial agriculture, to corporate executives and to oil companies for transportation fuel. The farmer who grew the food might keep 10 to 15 cents of the dollar.  If your dinner has eight ingredients from eight different areas, that food may have traveled thousands of miles, burning oil moving from where it was grown to where you eat it. But when you spend $1 at a farmers’ market or a locally-sourced restaurant, the money stays in your community.  Local food connects us, it builds local economies and it improves our health! RISKS AND CHALLENGESThe risks of not raising the money we need for the Kitchen Incubator is that we fail the hundreds of food entrepreneurs who want to start a business of their own; we fail to create jobs these people will provide; we fail to save new start-ups from launching. The challenges are not finding great partners.So far one of the major challenges has been knowledge that these new opportunities exist for local food producers. The food incubator model has really grown from virtually very few food/kitchen incubators to about 10 in the last few years.  And why such growth? With the booming demand for specialty and artisan foods, incubators can help hungry Food Entrepreneurs to get started be a success in a licensed kitchen at a fraction of the cost of leasing and building a kitchen of their own. Our team understands that the food business is capital intensive and requires a lot of time. We aren't glossing over any of the risks, but ensuring that pooling together resources from different food businesses is the way to go. Between us, we have experience in managing work spaces, restaurants, branding, IT and distribution systems. FROM THEN TO NOWInitial setup was fairly difficult, and for the first 6 months we focused solely on developing the space and our revenue streams. We finished construction and started to slowly attract new companies to start up in Lafayette while doing outreach to build capacity. Over the past three months we have seen more use of the services and space than the entire first year of operation, showing a clear momentum in the success of the services of the Acadiana Food Hub. We won't only work with low-income and disadvantaged food vendors, but also attract authentic and unique food businesses, who will pay to use the space as a way to bring in income. We will also offer branding and marketing advice to keep us running.  The risk is that enough people won’t use the space in enough time to keep us open. That’s why it’s important that we help to keep these services running as we continue to build capacity of a sustainable non-profit.HEAR IT FROM OTHERSAccording to the National Incubation Association, “By mitigating start-up costs and providing a nurturing environment, business incubators have successfully graduated over 87% of their firms and kept an astounding 84% of these thriving businesses within their local communities for years after graduation. The culinary incubator, often referred to as a “shared-use commercial kitchen,” has taken a time-tested successful concept and swapped out office space for kitchens. They have opened to much acclaim, nurtured successful businesses and been embraced by their communities. Other Ways You Can HelpWe realize everyone can’t contribute financially. So here are a few ways you can help besides donating!Spread the word. We want everyone in Acadiana to know what is available.We are always looking for volunteers. Consider participating one of our many farm-to-table events.Please help us fulfill our dream of preeving a local food hub for everyone.

<p><strong>STAGE : СЦЕНА is an experimental public space, where anyone can organize an event for their friends. We will build it for the fourth edition of <i>Construction</i> – a festival of independent art and music in Dnipro, Ukraine. We designed STAGE together with citizens of Dnipro and a group of international architects. We will build it with its future users. We will then present the cultural program we prepared with local artists. We are asking you – the community of backers – to finance building materials. We need 2000$ to start, but the more we collect, the more elements of STAGE we will build. Sky's the limit!</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>How will STAGE work?</h3>
<p>For three years, the <i>Construction</i> Festival has created places for independent art and music in Dnipro, Ukraine. On a campaign to amaze and surprise, we’ve held events in over thirty most unusual spaces. </p>
<p>Preparing for <i>Construction 4</i>, we asked the citizens of Dnipro: <i>What place in the city do you lack?</i></p>
<p>One thing united all the many answers: <i>We want a cozy space to organize all kinds of events by ourselves!</i></p>
<p>We thought: <i>It's really great that the citizens of Dnipro have so much initiative to organize events on their own.</i> So we designed a public space in the park and called it STAGE.</p>
<p>At STAGE, anyone can create events. We – the <i>Construction</i> team – will make some too. We’ve already planned some concerts, lectures, exhibitions, performances, and artistic experiments to kick things off. Then we’ll give STAGE to anyone in Dnipro, who wants to use this space.</p>
<p> </p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1001.photobucket.com/albums/af135/kubasnopek/1-kuba-small.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>How will STAGE look like?</h3>
<p>STAGE will be built in an abandoned part of Shevchenko Park, on the site of an old amphitheatre. It will be a temporary wooden structure. Beyond the stage itself, we designed a place for movie screenings and lectures, spaces for workshops and exhibitions, and lots of comfortable seating. We also designed greenery: the interior of STAGE will be a green tunnel. Our landscape designer helped us plant a special mixture of fragrant herbs and flowers that will attract butterflies :)</p>
<p>But our favourite part is STAGE's secret feature. The whole structure will work as a huge sound amplifier – a gigantic acoustic tube, similar to those in old gramophones. Just imagine: you attach a small source of sound (like a smartphone or a small speaker), and the tube makes it much louder. You can throw a birthday party, organize a lecture for your friends, or play in a concert. We can’t wait to see what the citizens of Dnipro invent for STAGE :)</p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>We prepared a sequence of diagrams to explain architecture of STAGE:</i></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1001.photobucket.com/albums/af135/kubasnopek/03-diagrams-en_1.gif"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Why do we call STAGE an experiment?</h3>
<p>Inventiveness is very important for us: STAGE is a huge experiment. Citizens of Dnipro designed it with a group of international architects. Using crowdfunding, we’ll pay for the building materials. We’ll build Stage together with its future users, then present the cultural program we prepared with local artists. At the end, we will give STAGE to the citizens of Dnipro.</p>
<p>At the heart of it all is a social agenda: STAGE is the beginning of many new communities. A community of designers met online to design it. A community of volunteers will meet in Dnipro to build it. And a community of backers make it all possible. With your support, STAGE will be realized—and even more communities will gather around it.</p>
<p><u>The design of STAGE is not final</u> – it is a prototype and we want the people of Dnipro to help us test it. We are building it to find out what kind of space the city really needs. We will build STAGE and give it to Dnipro for 100 days. We will observe: How does the city live in this space? What kind of events do people organize for themselves?</p>
<p>We want to talk to everyone about how we can make STAGE even more cool. We’ll ask everyone who comes, <i>How can Stage be improved?!</i></p>
<p>In 100 days we’ll deconstruct the prototype and start working on the brief for the permanent construction – STAGE 2.0.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>Everyone will be able to organize any events they like:</i></p>

<h3>How can you help us?</h3>
<p><strong>We’re gathering friends to build with us, and we’re collecting money for building materials. 2000$ is a minimum budget to start the construction, but the more we collect, the more elements of STAGE we will build. Sky's the limit!</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you live in Dnipro – bring your friends, become a part of this project, and spend some nice May days in great company! On June 3rd we’ll be waiting for you at the Festival! </strong> </p>

<p><strong>STAGE : СЦЕНА – це експериментальний публічний простір, де кожен охочий зможе влаштувати захід для своїх друзів. Сцена буде створена до відкриття четвертої ""Конструкції"" – фестивалю незалежного мистецтва та музики в місті Дніпро, Україна. Її дизайн буде розроблений спільно з мешканцями міста та командою міжнародних архітекторів, а зведена буде разом з майбутніми користувачами. Наступним кроком є представлення підготовленої місцевими художниками та музикантами культурної програми. Ми просимо вас, спільноту бекерів, допомогти нам зібрати кошти на будівельні матеріали. Нам потрібно зібрати хоча б 2000 $, але чим більше грошей буде зібрано, тим більше елементів Сцени ми зможемо побудувати. Бо не існує жодних обмежень!</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Як Сцена буде працювати?</h3>
<p>Вже три роки поспіль ми проводили фестиваль ""Конструкція"". За цей час було втілено більше ніж 30 заходів в незвичних місцях Дніпра. Ми дивували там, де ніхто не очікував. Готуючись до четвертої ""Конструкції"", ми запитали жителів міста якого простору їм не вистачає. Їм бракувало місць, де можна співати, займатися йогою, робити барбекю. Те, що об'єднало всі відповіді –  нестача затишного, камерного простору, де можна було б проводити свої заходи. Ми подумали: це ж так круто, коли жителі хочуть робити щось своє. Так і народилась ідея Сцени.</p>
<p>Сцена  –  це простір, в якому будуть представлені два типи подій: заплановані нами, а також ті, що спонтанно створюватимуть містяни. Ми – команда ""Конструкції"" – організуємо декілька лекцій, виставок, мистецьких експериментів, вистав і концертів. Потім віддамо Сцену мешканцям Дніпра, людям, що захочуть використовувати цей простір.</p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Як Сцена виглядатиме?</h3>

STAGE : СЦЕНА is an experimental public space, where anyone can organize an event for their friends. We will build it for the fourth edition of Construction – a festival of independent art and music in Dnipro, Ukraine. We designed STAGE together with citizens of Dnipro and a group of international architects. We will build it with its future users. We will then present the cultural program we prepared with local artists. We are asking you – the community of backers – to finance building materials. We need 2000$ to start, but the more we collect, the more elements of STAGE we will build. Sky's the limit!
 
How will STAGE work?
For three years, the Construction Festival has created places for independent art and music in Dnipro, Ukraine. On a campaign to amaze and surprise, we’ve held events in over thirty most unusual spaces. 
Preparing for Construction 4, we asked the citizens of Dnipro: What place in the city do you lack?
One thing united all the many answers: We want a cozy space to organize all kinds of events by ourselves!
We thought: It's really great that the citizens of Dnipro have so much initiative to organize events on their own. So we designed a public space in the park and called it STAGE.
At STAGE, anyone can create events. We – the Construction team – will make some too. We’ve already planned some concerts, lectures, exhibitions, performances, and artistic experiments to kick things off. Then we’ll give STAGE to anyone in Dnipro, who wants to use this space.
 
 
 
 
How will STAGE look like?
STAGE will be built in an abandoned part of Shevchenko Park, on the site of an old amphitheatre. It will be a temporary wooden structure. Beyond the stage itself, we designed a place for movie screenings and lectures, spaces for workshops and exhibitions, and lots of comfortable seating. We also designed greenery: the interior of STAGE will be a green tunnel. Our landscape designer helped us plant a special mixture of fragrant herbs and flowers that will attract butterflies :)
But our favourite part is STAGE's secret feature. The whole structure will work as a huge sound amplifier – a gigantic acoustic tube, similar to those in old gramophones. Just imagine: you attach a small source of sound (like a smartphone or a small speaker), and the tube makes it much louder. You can throw a birthday party, organize a lecture for your friends, or play in a concert. We can’t wait to see what the citizens of Dnipro invent for STAGE :)
 
We prepared a sequence of diagrams to explain architecture of STAGE:

 
 
 
Why do we call STAGE an experiment?
Inventiveness is very important for us: STAGE is a huge experiment. Citizens of Dnipro designed it with a group of international architects. Using crowdfunding, we’ll pay for the building materials. We’ll build Stage together with its future users, then present the cultural program we prepared with local artists. At the end, we will give STAGE to the citizens of Dnipro.
At the heart of it all is a social agenda: STAGE is the beginning of many new communities. A community of designers met online to design it. A community of volunteers will meet in Dnipro to build it. And a community of backers make it all possible. With your support, STAGE will be realized—and even more communities will gather around it.
The design of STAGE is not final – it is a prototype and we want the people of Dnipro to help us test it. We are building it to find out what kind of space the city really needs. We will build STAGE and give it to Dnipro for 100 days. We will observe: How does the city live in this space? What kind of events do people organize for themselves?
We want to talk to everyone about how we can make STAGE even more cool. We’ll ask everyone who comes, How can Stage be improved?!
In 100 days we’ll deconstruct the prototype and start working on the brief for the permanent construction – STAGE 2.0.
 
Everyone will be able to organize any events they like:

 
 
How can you help us?
We’re gathering friends to build with us, and we’re collecting money for building materials. 2000$ is a minimum budget to start the construction, but the more we collect, the more elements of STAGE we will build. Sky's the limit!
If you live in Dnipro – bring your friends, become a part of this project, and spend some nice May days in great company! On June 3rd we’ll be waiting for you at the Festival!

STAGE : СЦЕНА – це експериментальний публічний простір, де кожен охочий зможе влаштувати захід для своїх друзів. Сцена буде створена до відкриття четвертої ""Конструкції"" – фестивалю незалежного мистецтва та музики в місті Дніпро, Україна. Її дизайн буде розроблений спільно з мешканцями міста та командою міжнародних архітекторів, а зведена буде разом з майбутніми користувачами. Наступним кроком є представлення підготовленої місцевими художниками та музикантами культурної програми. Ми просимо вас, спільноту бекерів, допомогти нам зібрати кошти на будівельні матеріали. Нам потрібно зібрати хоча б 2000 $, але чим більше грошей буде зібрано, тим більше елементів Сцени ми зможемо побудувати. Бо не існує жодних обмежень!
 
Як Сцена буде працювати?
Вже три роки поспіль ми проводили фестиваль ""Конструкція"". За цей час було втілено більше ніж 30 заходів в незвичних місцях Дніпра. Ми дивували там, де ніхто не очікував. Готуючись до четвертої ""Конструкції"", ми запитали жителів міста якого простору їм не вистачає. Їм бракувало місць, де можна співати, займатися йогою, робити барбекю. Те, що об'єднало всі відповіді –  нестача затишного, камерного простору, де можна було б проводити свої заходи. Ми подумали: це ж так круто, коли жителі хочуть робити щось своє. Так і народилась ідея Сцени.
Сцена  –  це простір, в якому будуть представлені два типи подій: заплановані нами, а також ті, що спонтанно створюватимуть містяни. Ми – команда ""Конструкції"" – організуємо декілька лекцій, виставок, мистецьких експериментів, вистав і концертів. Потім віддамо Сцену мешканцям Дніпра, людям, що захочуть використовувати цей простір.
 

 
 
Як Сцена виглядатиме?
Сцена буде побудована в покинутій частині парку  Шевченка на місці старого амфітеатру. Це буде тимчасова дерев'яна конструкція. Окрім самої сцени, ми побудуємо місце з екраном для кінопоказів та лекцій, простір для проведення воркшопів і виставок, а також багато зручних сидінь. Додатково ми розробили проект озеленення: Сцена нагадуватиме зелений тунель. Наш спеціаліст з ландшафтного дизайну підібрав спеціальну суміш запашних трав і квітів, що приваблюватиме метеликів :)
Тепер щодо нашої улюбленої частини – секретної функції сцени. Вся конструкція буде працювати як величезний підсилювач звуку – гігантська акустична труба, подібна до тих, які були в старих грамофонах. Тільки уявіть: ви підключаєте свою невелику колонку чи смартфон, і ця труба багаторазово підсилює звук. Робить його настільки гучніше, що кожен може організувати для своїх друзів концерт, вечірку або день народження. Ми вже не можемо дочекатися проявів винахідливості мешканців Дніпра та їхніх ідеї використання Сцени :)

So far, many people and groups have been reached, whoever, we believe is important to continue expanding the permaculture community in Guatemala. Given the success of our workshop participants in applying their newfound knowledge in their homes, communities and organizations, there is a growing interest in being part of the trainings offered at IMAP´s demonstrative center.Many organizations have contacted IMAP in order to be part of the scholarship program, which has allowed to strengthen inter institutional bonds with those who share the mission of contributing to the improvement of life conditions in Guatemala. At the same time, these contacts have showed us the need for increasing the reach of our scholarship program.Our Scholarship Program is currently funded through the sale of our workshops and courses, where 10% of the received fees are put into this fund.  However with the increasing demand and need for scholarships, the fund is not enough to provide opportunities to everyone. This why we are looking forward to create educational materials and artisan  for sale in order to increase our Scholarship Program budget and be able to fund more people who need it.We are looking for startup capital to jumpstart this new activity. The funds collected will be used to cover workshop cost including, materials as well as the promotion and sale of products to make the Scholarship Program sustainable. With your contribution you will support those who are willing to become agents and promoters of social change in their communities, applying and sharing their knowledge of Mesoamerican permaculture, ecological agriculture focused on native and creole species, and Guatemala´s food sovereignty. Instituto Mesoamericano de Permacultura IMAP.San Lucas Tolimán, Sololá, Guatemala.Programa de becas educativas 2019.Desde su fundación en el año 2000, el IMAP ha buscado promover la creación de conocimiento aplicando los principios de la permacultura y la cosmovisión maya.

<h3>WELCOME TO FILMED BY BIKE</h3>
<p>I'm Ayleen Crotty, the founder and Festival Director of the <a href=""http://FilmedByBike.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Filmed by Bike film festival</a>. We feature the <a href=""http://filmedbybike.org/watch/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">world's best bike bike movies</a>, with independent submissions from all over the world.<br/><br/>I started Filmed by Bike in 2003  to get people excited about bikes, in a creative way that builds bike community. I absolutely love what I do and <strong>I am so thankful to the many people who volunteer their time to help make this all possible.</strong><br/><br/>Filmed by Bike film programs <a href=""http://filmedbybike.org/bike-movie-nights-schedule/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">travel year round throughout the world</a> as a way to raise funds for bike advocacy organizations, high school mt. bike teams and other important causes. These bike movie events are a powerful (and fun!) way for people to support vibrant bike causes.</p>
<p>We are so fortunate to be based in Portland, Oregon - an inspiring city for bike creativity that fuels everything we do.</p>
<p>More than 72,000 people attend SXSW every year. This is an incredible opportunity to get them inspired about bikes and what Filmed by Bike does to build bike community worldwide.</p>

<h3>WE'RE MAKING AN IMPACT</h3>

<h3>HELP US REACH OUR GOAL</h3>
<p>Our goal is $5,000, and this is how we'll use the funds.</p>
<ul>
<li>Send our stellar lean-and-mean team of 4 people to work the event: travel, lodging, meals and (of course!) bike rental.</li>
<li>Essential equipment purchases - a canopy, screen and lighting that we'll be able to use for other events throughout the year.</li>
<li>The printed materials necessary to promote Filmed by Bike.</li>
<li>We are a grassroots organization that knows how to make maximum impact with a limited budget.</li>
<li>We will be contributing some of our own funds to the project as well, and <strong>our team is all volunteering their time.</strong><br/> </li>

<li>We have a variety of fun and creative thank you gifts available.</li>
<li>We are especially excited about our <strong>Summertime Filmmaker Social</strong>, an opportunity to hang out with some of our filmmakers and talk about how they create bike films, while enjoying complimentary food and drink in a very intimate setting.

<h3>THE IMPACT WE CAN MAKE</h3>
<p>Portland, Oregon is a bike progressive city. We love sharing our experience and knowledge with others. We are hosting an outdoor arena in the heart of SXSW showcasing the world's best bike movies. It's free for anyone to walk by, sink in and be surrounded by bike culture.<br/><br/>The bike advocacy toolkit is woefully outdated and lacking in options. Filmed by Bike's movie collections are a powerful tool for cities worldwide to use in building bike culture.</p>
<p>New cities are partnering with us every month - they're hosting Filmed by Bike movie events to raise funds. Most of these groups come back year after year because their events are so successful in raising money for their bike-related causes.</p>
<p><strong>But we want to help more cities. </strong>We are working hard to reach out to all sorts of people and organizations worldwide in various ways, and SXSW is an opportunity to reach some 72,000 creatives all in just a few days.</p>
<p>We know events and expos. We're skilled at working a crowd, connecting with people and making a big splash. We're excited to <strong>spread the Gospel of Bike Culture</strong> at SXSW!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>
<br/>RISKS + CHALLENGES</h3>
<p>We'll be honest. This event is a huge undertaking. We will be working long, hard days. As a film festival, we cannot afford the travel expenses.<br/><br/>That's why we're reaching out to you, our community.</p>
<p>We are confident in the skills, talents and background we all bring to this project. We know we can maximize this opportunity and make a huge impact at SXSW. <strong>But we need your help to raise a little funding to get there.</strong><br/> </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Thank you all for visiting!  My name is Preethi Ramaprasad, and those of you who know me, know that I love Bharatanatyam (Indian classical dance): performing, teaching, talking, costuming, all of it.  I have been studying, performing, and teaching this dance form and affiliated arts for over two decades.</p>
<p>About a year ago, I moved to San Francisco and joined SAFEhouse Arts as a Lead Artist in Residence.  I met Joe Landini, the Artistic Director of SAFEhouse Arts and mastermind of such events as the West Wave Dance Festival. As I started creating work here, I discovered quickly that San Francisco is an incredible hub for the arts, especially the field of dance.  Joe, impressed with the potential of Indian dance in this city, wanted to create a festival to promote these artistic forms and asked me to curate it.  It's an honor to be a part of his vision, which to me, only justifies what I have always believed:  Indian dance is universally relatable when given the opportunity.  Showcasing Indian dance in an artistic city like San Francisco can introduce more people to these beautiful and powerful forms of expression. </p>
<p>I got to work and found phenomenal artists who graciously agreed to show work:  Puneet and Taniya Panda, Sri Thina Subramanian, Nadhi Thekkek and Nava Dance Theatre, and Vidhya Subramaniam.  </p>
<p>We can't wait to present these artists along with discussions about their work! </p>
<p>We need funds to:  </p>
<ul>
<li>Pay for the best artists</li>
<li>Promote the show</li>
<li>Support the artists' performance needs</li>
<li>Provide a platform to meet artists and discuss work</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>While some of the ticket sales will go directly to the artists, most of our funds will go towards paying for their work, and also promoting this festival.  Your contributions will be tax- deductible, through SAFEhouse Arts.    </p>
<p>We are also lucky to have volunteers from the RAW program at SAFEhouse Arts to help us with technical and other house demands.    </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contribution will go a long way for the field of arts in San Francisco.  </p>
<ul>
<li>Because this is the first festival showcasing Indian choreography in the city of San Francisco, we hope it will create a better platform for creative arts in an environment that regularly features the most sought-after performances.</li>
<li>SAFEhouse Arts, our host, has a record with several successful festivals including the West Wave Dance Festival, and Summer Performance Festival.  </li>
<li>A festival of this kind will be a step to create support, performances, and discussions of all kinds for diasporic arts in San Francisco.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<ul>
<li>This is the first year that we are attempting something of this scale.  We run the risk of not being able to support our artists entirely.  However, through the support of SAFEhouse Arts' venue, tech, team, and RAW Artist volunteers, we hope to be able to host our artists and discussions to the best of our ability.  </li>
<li>Because of these risks, we are starting with a two day festival and hope it will grow in years to come!  </li>
</ul>
</div><div>

</div></div>","Short Summary
Thank you all for visiting!  My name is Preethi Ramaprasad, and those of you who know me, know that I love Bharatanatyam (Indian classical dance): performing, teaching, talking, costuming, all of it.  I have been studying, performing, and teaching this dance form and affiliated arts for over two decades.
About a year ago, I moved to San Francisco and joined SAFEhouse Arts as a Lead Artist in Residence.  I met Joe Landini, the Artistic Director of SAFEhouse Arts and mastermind of such events as the West Wave Dance Festival. As I started creating work here, I discovered quickly that San Francisco is an incredible hub for the arts, especially the field of dance.  Joe, impressed with the potential of Indian dance in this city, wanted to create a festival to promote these artistic forms and asked me to curate it.  It's an honor to be a part of his vision, which to me, only justifies what I have always believed:  Indian dance is universally relatable when given the opportunity.  Showcasing Indian dance in an artistic city like San Francisco can introduce more people to these beautiful and powerful forms of expression. 
I got to work and found phenomenal artists who graciously agreed to show work:  Puneet and Taniya Panda, Sri Thina Subramanian, Nadhi Thekkek and Nava Dance Theatre, and Vidhya Subramaniam.  
We can't wait to present these artists along with discussions about their work! 
We need funds to:  

Pay for the best artists
Promote the show
Support the artists' performance needs
Provide a platform to meet artists and discuss work


What We Need
While some of the ticket sales will go directly to the artists, most of our funds will go towards paying for their work, and also promoting this festival.  Your contributions will be tax- deductible, through SAFEhouse Arts.    
We are also lucky to have volunteers from the RAW program at SAFEhouse Arts to help us with technical and other house demands.    

The Impact
Your contribution will go a long way for the field of arts in San Francisco.  

Because this is the first festival showcasing Indian choreography in the city of San Francisco, we hope it will create a better platform for creative arts in an environment that regularly features the most sought-after performances.
SAFEhouse Arts, our host, has a record with several successful festivals including the West Wave Dance Festival, and Summer Performance Festival.  
A festival of this kind will be a step to create support, performances, and discussions of all kinds for diasporic arts in San Francisco.


Risks & Challenges

This is the first year that we are attempting something of this scale.  We run the risk of not being able to support our artists entirely.  However, through the support of SAFEhouse Arts' venue, tech, team, and RAW Artist volunteers, we hope to be able to host our artists and discussions to the best of our ability.  
Because of these risks, we are starting with a two day festival and hope it will grow in years to come!  


Other Ways You Can Help
Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:

Share information about the festival so we can sell out of tickets!
Share THIS page so more people can contribute to this cause for the arts!  

Thank you so much for your time!",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>New Mill, Cross-in-Hand is a Grade II listed windmill in East Sussex, England.<br/>Built in the early 19th Century she was the last windmill working by wind commercially in Sussex, ceasing in 1969.  In 2016, an appeal was successful resulting in the replacement of one corner of the heavy trestle which keeps the mill standing.</p>
<p>Further work and waterproofing is needed to prop the opposite corner and to save her from collapse.<br/><br/>Your donation will help preserve what is considered by many to be one of the finest examples of an English Post Mill.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>For this next stage of restoration we require a top up to the remaining funds of £1000. This money will go towards propping the other corner of the trestle and waterproofing the roundhouse from the elements.  This work, done with a mix of professional millwrights and volunteers will add years to the building's current short life until much larger funds become available for more extensive restoration to full working order.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>More and more mills in England are being lost each year to decay and conversion, with your help we can preserve this fine example for the enjoyment of future generations.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
<p>A project such as this is a huge undertaking requiring specialist knowledge. A professional millwright has been contracted to undertake the work and has already drawn up plans for the next few stages of repair work.<br/><br/>All the work undertaken so far, and to be undertaken in the near future, will be to a high standard of authenticity, replacing damaged and rotten material only where necessary and keeping as much of the original fabric as possible.<br/><br/> </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Film Is Truth needs your help! After 20 years as the premier video rental store in Bellingham, Washington, Film is Truth is ready to complete its transition to a nonprofit model. In the last three years, we have worked to form a board, obtain 501(c)3 status, organize community events, and sustain the store Film Is Truth 24 Times a Second.</p>
<p>Our collection of over 19,000 titles has been carefully curated for decades and is unlike any other collection in the United States. We, of course, carry a number of popular titles, but we also provide access to the weird, the underappreciated, the cutting-edge, and the classics that are difficult to find anywhere else! Our collection is a unique resource of art and imagination, and it needs your help.  We are the place you come to when you can’t find what you want streaming online!</p>
<p>We now find ourselves at a crossroads as we work to fulfill our mission of acting as a “cultural resource serving Bellingham, WA and the surrounding communities by promoting the appreciation of cinema as art, as entertainment, and as education through providing access to an extensive collection of physical media.” Our retail operation is no longer able to sustain itself, and we need to raise money to keep the collection together and available to the public.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>How much we can do is based on how much the community can give.</p>
<p>If we raise $18,000, we can keep the collection together and available to the public! We are setting up a system for community members to order rentals online for pick-up at selected locations in Bellingham. We will also continue to use the collection as a resource for community events, clubs, and educational opportunities. If we cannot raise at least $18,000, our ability to sustain the collection will be in jeopardy. There is a good chance it will have to be sold in order to clear debt associated with our move to our current location.</p>
<p>If we can raise $30,000, we will have the funds we need to continue to operate the video store you know and love for a long time to come!</p>
<p>We have cool perks to offer, including free rentals, memberships, and great Film Is Truth swag!</p>
<p>What happens if we don’t raise at least $18,000? Where will your money go? We will commit to keeping Film Is Truth open as long as possible. Any funds raised will go towards improving our storefront and a renewed marketing push to help us do so!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>It might be easy to see a brick and mortar video store as cute, archaic, and unnecessary with the rise of streaming services. But we are more than just a video store, we are an art collection. Handing over control of what movies are available to the public to a small number of streaming services limits those films to only those that some executives think will be profitable. We care about what is good, what is dangerous, what is interesting, what is history, what is local, what is unique, what is potentially world changing. Film matters, art matters, and it also builds community. We at Film Is Truth remain committed to building that community and curating our unique collection.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest risk to this campaign is that the video rental industry is struggling; with the rise of streaming services, fewer people are leaving their house to rent movies. But if there is anyone qualified to face this challenge, it is us! Film Is Truth has persisted even as many other video stores have closed. We know that our collection is unique, our staff is knowledgeable and awesome, and that our store is something special!</p>
<p>We have a new business plan that includes an online database capable of processing rentals, longer hours, creating “host” dropoff and pickup locations for weekend rentals, membership packages, a calendar of film clubs and events, and an expansion of our educational resources.</p>
<p>We know we can do it, we just need your help to get there!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Even if you can't donate, please help us spread the word!</p>

<h3>The Shenandoah Valley needs the Art Mobile.</h3>
<h2>The Art Mobile needs YOU.</h2>
<p>The Shenandoah Valley Art Mobile is a new nonprofit with the aim of increasing the availability of art making. We are going to bring more art to more folks by buying a bus and renovating it into an arts studio and classroom.</p>
<p>We firmly believe that art making is an integral part of life, thus we have a deeply-rooted desire to increase access to art-making experiences. The Art Mobile will bring an art classroom into spaces where there is a lack of access to the creative process. In addition to art supplies and space, the Art Mobile will provide highly-qualified instructors. By way of having an art studio on a bus, the Art Mobile will reduce transportation concerns that can be a barrier to art making.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1529047809/f8zssbo9zujjmm33rvge.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Contributing to this campaign will help us purchase our bus and begin renovations. Following renovations, our first phase of programming will be an after-school neighborhood route. The bus will travel to several stops an evening and provide art-making opportunities for local youth. But first, we need your help!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Help Buy Our Bus!</h3>
<p>Our funding goal will cover the purchase of the bus, getting it to our renovation site, and some of the fun stuff—such as insurance. We've set up some sweet incentives for your consideration:</p>
<ul style=""margin-left:40px;"">
<li>Art Mobile logo smocks and totes</li>
<li>Prints of local artists' work</li>
<li>Private dinner with Mashita and The Friendly Fermenter</li>
<li>Paint parties!</li>
<li>Plus keep an eye out for drop-in perks throughout the campaign</li>
</ul>
<p>Any funds raised by this campaign will go toward the purchase of our bus, regardless of whether or not we meet our funding goal.</p>
<p>Here is an artist's rendering of our floor plan:</p>

<h3>Why Support this Campaign, though?</h3>
<p>We are already engaged in meaningful art-making projects in our community. In April of this year, we completed our first annual mural project. We invited the community to participate, and participate they did! Over the course of a weekend, we had approximately 90 folks pick up a paint brush and make their mark on downtown Harrisonburg.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Who We Are &amp; What We Want to Become</strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Girls Rock Camp Guelph was launched in 2016 in response to the success of these camps in surrounding cities. We believe that introducing a Girls Rock Camp to Guelph will impact the next generation of our city's creative community in a way that addresses the gender disparity in our thriving, but predominantly male, rock music scene. </p>
<p>We piloted the program last year on a small budget and an amazing amount of community enthusiasm and support. We had 10 campers, who formed 3 bands. They performed a concert at the end of the week of camp to a crowd of over 120 people!</p>
<p>This year, we have grown to 20 campers and have moved to a larger space to support this expansion. Because our budget is small, we rely on our fundraising events and sponsors to secure extra funds for important things including space rental, equipment, supplies, as well as special aid for campers in financial need. Our March Break Camp will be running March 13th-17th. We hope to expand by offering a summer camp in the future. </p>
<p>Our goal is to raise $4000. All extra funds will be used to aid in our program expansion. Your support and generosity is greatly appreciated. </p>

<p>""I was a bit nervous when I asked my mom to sign me up for the girls rock camp last March Break. I didn't know anyone else who was going but it sounded like a lot of fun and I ended up making new friends right away.  The rock band councillors were very welcoming and encouraging and I decided to try the guitar. I learned a few new chords and my group made up a band name and we got creative and wrote some songs. We learned about some legendary female rock musicians and met some local bands. The whole week was an amazing experience that has inspired me to try new things, and I hope I get to go again next year!"" - Ailsa, GRCG 2016</p>
<p>""Having enrolled with GRC Guelph 2016 has opened up tons of new opportunities for my friends and I. Just some of the many were playing a show in front of everyone's friends and family, being introduced to some amazing people, deepening my appreciation for music creation and inspiring me to keep writing music. Best of all, after the weeklong engaging experience, my band has stuck together and continued to learn about and enjoy music. I would highly recommend this camp to anyone who has any interest in playing music and making friends in the process. It is an inclusive and enjoyable opportunity for everyone, no matter your musical ability at the time."" - Sadie, GRCG 2016</p>

However, in 2019, learning to live and love like Jesus looks a whole lot different all over the world.

So what would happen if we courageously asked...<i>why? </i></p><p>Our heart for Anastasi Celebration is this: that the living and active hope we share can become the single focus of a vibrant global family which fills all of the earth.<br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1554987321/cdzckqpcozxyzrv1t4xk.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get.</h3><p><strong>The Access Fund.</strong></p><p>We need $5,000 to help send up to 50 talented young people from the Middle East and North Africa to Anastasi Celebration.</p><p>Your donations will cover flights to and from Thessaloniki, plus living expenses for our 5 days together.

The hope of the “ανάσταση”, (meaning “resurrection”), has been expressed all across the face of the earth, and throughout the vast expanse of history. But... this isn’t being celebrated collectively, and we’re here to change this.We believe world-changing, hope-bringing movements depend on strong, personal, honest relationships between people with a common hope. That’s why we have created a space to celebrate the resurrection this Easter like never before: as a global family.  Why Does This Matter?Today a global culture is fast emerging in our increasingly interconnected world. However, in 2019, learning to live and love like Jesus looks a whole lot different all over the world. We all know there is a common thread, and yet it looks and feels fragmented, especially from the outside looking in.Even when we do gather, Western narratives and frames tend to dominate. So what would happen if we courageously asked...why? Our heart for Anastasi Celebration is this: that the living and active hope we share can become the single focus of a vibrant global family which fills all of the earth.What We Need & What You Get.The Access Fund.We need $5,000 to help send up to 50 talented young people from the Middle East and North Africa to Anastasi Celebration.Your donations will cover flights to and from Thessaloniki, plus living expenses for our 5 days together. Visa’s are pending, applications are in, commitments have been made! The more money we raise, the more people we send. It really is as simple as it sounds!The Rewards!Take a look at the perks on the right-hand side!Ready to Pledge? Donate Now…...or Read On To Dive Deeper Into Our Impact and Vision!The ImpactWhat’s The Need?There are many unhelpful divisions in our world. Cultural conflict is a reality, ideological tension is a thing. We want to address misunderstandings of the global community through face to face friendships. Who Will Benefit?Our beneficiaries include amazing individuals who are not able to raise funds publicly themselves. They come from a range of areas from the Middle East, North Africa, to Western Europe. Our beneficiaries also include -- you! Only together can we experience the richness of a shared community, the beauty of neighbors to whom we are neighbors too. Everyone benefits! What will Anastasi 2019 look like?The 5-day Anastasi 2019 program will be comprised of the following elements:
Commemoration of Christ’s death and resurrection
Presentation of Eastern personal narratives of faith in Christ
Experiential and educational workshops pertaining to the expression of Christianity in  various cultural contexts
Collective prayer and musical expression
Distribution of modern-Greek Scriptures to Thessalonian households

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contribution will make a huge difference to our goals this year. Raindance would like to open its doors and attract young audiences to experience their first independent film on the big screen. Our research shows this is needed more than ever:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the 1990s 15-24 year-olds age group regularly made up over 40% of the audience whereas in 2017 they represented just 28%. (<a href=""https://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/downloads/bfi-statistical-yearbook-audiences-2018-12-17.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Source</a>)</li>
<li>50% of young viewers say that 'cinema tickets, VOD and DVD are too expensive', which makes them choose online streaming platforms or free streaming websites. (<a href=""http://www.europacreativa-media.it/documenti/allegati/2015/Executive_Summary_Audiovisual_Audience_Survey.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Source</a>)</li>
<li>46% of teenage viewers would go to the cinema less, while 24% would probably stop going entirely in favour of watching the latest releases from the comfort of their own home. (<a href=""https://www.askattest.com/blog/home/uk-film-industry-statistics-2017"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Source</a>)</li>
<li>Younger audiences would prefer watching independent and foreign movies at home, as they don’t want to pay a full price cinema ticket for a film they might not like.

since 2002, and have run my own Victory specific shop out here in Central Iowa for the last 9 years now.</p><p>The more time that passes since Polaris decided to discontinue Victory, the more I realize how much Victory appeals to me and the many other loyal owners I encountered every day.  There is nothing else like Victory on the market and I’ve made up my mind to stick with my Vic’s and continue to love them forever.  Many of you folks out there feel the same way.   So a while ago I told myself that I’d do what it took to keep the bikes on the road and keep the Victory…..lifestyle (is that the right word?) alive.</p><p>Our shop specializes in Victory work, we hold special events, we make useful, Vic specific, video tutorials, use social media to disseminate Victory specific knowledge and culture., and generally try to be good ambassadors of our chosen brand. </p><p>So, to further that agenda of brand enthusiasm I’ve been tossing around the idea of a Victory specific, web-based, “TV Show” all about Victory bikes and culture.  This show would have segments devoted to Victory specific subjects on Maintenance, Performance, Brand History, and Culture.  I hope to make 4 episodes a year – quarterly – that you can watch on Youtube, Facebook, or our website.   I’m sure you all have seen the great quality videos Ryan Buck makes for our shop (if not, check out the Vicbuilder channel on Youtube).  You can expect the same high-quality entertainment out of the show I have planned.</p><p>But I need your help.  These videos take a lot of time and money.  I run a VERY busy shop and I only have a budget for so much.  I find myself thinking that “I’m sitting here on such good opportunity to make a very cool, fun show that will enhance a person’s Victory motorcycle ownership experience” – what’s stopping me.  OK, well, it’s the money that’s stopping me.</p><p>So, if you like the idea of a high-quality show that will include a segment of time devoted to technical knowledge and maintenance of Victory motorcycles – you need to donate.  If you like the idea of that show also having a portion highlighting Victory specific performance enhancements and fast bikes – you need to donate.  If learning about the history of an American bike brand being created from scratch appeals to you, you need to donate.  Lastly, if the thought of watching a show where Victory specific events, manufacturers, owners, enthusiasts, and bikes from all over the Nation (and world) are neatly wrapped up into a high-quality video you can watch from home – you need to donate!!!</p><p>And if the thought of “My Gawd, I want a show that has all that wrapped up into one!” – you need to donate!   With the structure of the show this way I hope you’ll see that the whole Victory community is going to get something out of this. </p><p>I’d like to raise an initial $7500 to get the pilot episode off the ground and leave some seeds for the next one.  Ultimately, I’d like to whittle each episode down to around three to four thousand, but we’ll learn a bunch from the pilot.  In a perfect world we’d raise enough for a whole season.  When Ryan Randall from 801 and I raced our boosted Victory’s in Colorado this Spring that video was watched over 16 thousand times on Facebook and youtube.  If everyone had put in a dollar we’d have almost enough to run a whole season of episodes!  Imagine what a bunch of 10 dollar, 20, 50, 100 dollar donations could create!  In my mind I anticipate episode length to easily be about 45 minutes or so. </p><p>So, this is me, Rylan Vos, owner of The Vic Shop, saying to you – Victory enthusiast.  Help keep our brand alive, help keep the brand vibrant and relevant.  Have you ever said to yourself – “Victory could have done a better job with marketing”.  Well – here is OUR chance.  Help me make something cool, that we’re proud of, and that gets you excited about the bikes and community we love to be a part of!  Donate now.  Thank you!</p></div>","Hey, it’s Rylan at The Vic Shop.  If you don’t know about me I’ll tell you that I’ve been in love with and working on Victory’s since 2002, and have run my own Victory specific shop

out of the show I have planned.But I need your help.  These videos take a lot of time and money.  I run a VERY busy shop and I only have a budget for so much.  I find myself thinking that “I’m sitting here on such good opportunity to make a very cool, fun show that will enhance a person’s Victory motorcycle ownership experience” – what’s stopping me.  OK, well, it’s the money that’s stopping me.So, if you like the idea of a high-quality show that will include a segment of time devoted to technical knowledge and maintenance of Victory motorcycles – you need to donate.  If you like the idea of that show also having a portion highlighting Victory specific performance enhancements and fast bikes – you need to donate.  If learning about the history of an American bike brand being created from scratch appeals to you, you need to donate.  Lastly, if the thought of watching a show where Victory specific events, manufacturers, owners, enthusiasts, and bikes from all over the Nation (and world) are neatly wrapped up into a high-quality video you can watch from home – you need to donate!!!And if the thought of “My Gawd, I want a show that has all that wrapped up into one!” – you need to donate!   With the structure of the show this way I hope you’ll see that the whole Victory community is going to get something out of this. I’d like to raise an initial $7500 to get the pilot episode off the ground and leave some seeds for the next one.  Ultimately, I’d like to whittle each episode down to around three to four thousand, but we’ll learn a bunch from the pilot.  In a perfect world we’d raise enough for a whole season.  When Ryan Randall from 801 and I raced our boosted Victory’s in Colorado this Spring that video was watched over 16 thousand times on Facebook and youtube.  If everyone had put in a dollar we’d have almost enough to run a whole season of episodes!  Imagine what a bunch of 10 dollar, 20, 50, 100 dollar donations could create!  In my mind I anticipate episode length to easily be about 45 minutes or so. So, this is me, Rylan Vos, owner of The Vic Shop, saying to you – Victory enthusiast.  Help keep our brand alive, help keep the brand vibrant and relevant.  Have you ever said to yourself – “Victory could have done a better job with marketing”.  Well – here is OUR chance.  Help me make something cool, that we’re proud of, and that gets you excited about the bikes and community we love to be a part of!  Donate now.  Thank you!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Howdy.</h3>
<p>I'm Eric Ellis. I'm an Idaho-based actor, writer and director working with Encore Theatre Company in Nampa, Idaho.  For eight years my friends and I were employed on the Thunder Mountain Train Line in Horseshoe Bend, Idaho, where we delivered a taste of the Old West. We robbed our audience members, fought and shot each other, and made folks laugh, all while being as historically accurate as possible.</p>
<p>We were, without a doubt, the most popular and successful fake gunfighters performing on a train line in the entire state.</p>
<p>Sadly, after the 2015 season, the Thunder Mountain Line called it quits, leaving us on foot and without an audience. Since then, opportunities to perform Wild West shootout reenactments have been scarce. Earlier this summer, though, there was a glimmer of hope:  Encore Theatre Company asked us to bring our brand of comic, improv-based, historically accurate, fake gunfighting to Nampa's Stampede Community Festival! </p>
</div><div>
<div>
<p>Festival organizers believe we can help draw more people to the Festival, a FREE event that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Benefits the Fireman's Burnout Fund</li>
<li>Benefits the local Kiwanis Club</li>
<li>Helps rejuvenate Downtown Nampa</li>
<li>Helps build community spirit </li>
</ul>
<p>We are truly passionate about the western reenactments we perform.  By making them historically accurate and writing stories around actual historic events, we bring history to life and help teach kids and grownups about Idaho history. And by making them funny and thrilling, we aim to entertain as much as we educate.</p>
<h3>But There Is A Problem</h3>
<p>Costumes are expensive. Guns are expensive. Blanks are expensive. And our actors, talented and dedicated, deserve to be paid. At a minimum, it's going to cost us $575 for each of the three performances. That's a total of $1,725, all to put on a FREE performance that benefits the community. </p>
<p>The Stampede board has pledged $750 toward these expenses, but with just two weeks until the performances, that leaves us to raise at least $975 so the show can go on, <strong>but if we can raise $500 more, we will bring our shootout show to Boise, too!</strong></p>
<p>When you donate to this worthy cause, it's a historical contribution to the community: This is the first of many Stampede Shootouts to come, helping increase attendance at the Stampede Festival. Plus, we'll be educating the public about the history of our area.</p>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>In the interest of transparency, here is our show budget.</p>
<p>Actors (8 @ $40/show)....$960</p>
<p>Writer/Director..................$200</p>

<p>Blank Ammo......................$90</p>
<p>Mic Rental..........................$25</p>
<p>----------------------------------------</p>
<p>Total...............................$1,725</p>
<p>Notice that this list doesn't have anything for set props, or for any additional staff. We are begging, borrowing and stealing for these, or building them from scraps.  We don't take anything for granted in the theater community.</p>
<h3>Thank You, Friend!</h3>

<p>Please give whatever you can, and thank you!</p>

<h3>Dreams start best with a full belly! <br/> </h3>
<p>My name is Soon, I grew up in a poor fishing village in Cambodia - food was important, often we did not have enough food, we'd share 1 packet of noodles and rice soup between 4. It was a tough start in life and must have been terribly hard for my mother but I have always dreamed of a better future and have worked hard since a young age to create this. Now I am seeking support to build something incredible - <strong>The Fish Island Arts Centre - FIAC</strong> is a place to share the story of local cuisine, heritage, art, and culture and create something that builds capacity, knowledge, and self-esteem in the same community where I was born and raised, in Kampot, Cambodia.</p>
<p>2019 has been a good year. In June this year, I was flown to Switzerland and hosted by World Tourism Forum as the winner of a World Tourism Star Award - this award (and support) means a world to me as it’s wonderful recognition and gives me more empowerment to follow my dream. I feel strongly about teaching, employing and sharing skills with disadvantaged women and youth. I am now launching a fundraising campaign to call on friends and supporters to help me build a new restaurant as the first step towards creating the <strong>Fish Island International Arts Centre</strong> where we can build on all the good work started here at KAMA, Kampot.</p>
<p>I'm a Cambodian woman, a mother, cook, tour guide, entrepreneur (I only recently learned that word) and local businesswoman. When I began work as a child, I'd earn 20cents by cleaning fishing boats plus other jobs like selling cakes door to door - this way I could support my three youngers siblings while my single mother was also away working by collecting seaweed.  </p>
<p>While still in my teens, I was sent away to work as a maid, first unpaid work in Phnom Penh then onto Malaysia where I worked another 8 years, experiencing much isolation, loneliness, and very long hours for little pay - many commentators describe this lowly employment as modern-day slavery.  However, I didn't feel disadvantaged but happy to have work with a kind family who allowed my time off on Sundays to attended courses at a Filipino run church where I was able to gain certificates in baking and other practical areas. Upon my return to Cambodia, I built a family home for my mother and soon opened my own restaurant. There were many hardships with this first venture, not least, taking time off to give birth to my baby girl now 5. Since this time, I've gained much experience and while I shut down my first Cambodian restaurant, I soon found work as manager of a popular café in Kampot, then moved on to become manager and owner of KAMA café. I have created this business as a social enterprise to train and employ more than 30 local women in just four years. During this time I have also established myself as a local artist, specializing in woodcut printmaking, and have had several successful exhibitions, my print artworks often show daily life in Kampot or aspects of my own story and I will offer these art prints at ""perks"" for campaign supporters.</p>
<h3>What we're going to do!</h3>
<p>We'll get to work on building <strong>The Fish Island Arts Centre</strong> by first building a restaurant - this entire initiative located out in the middle of Trey Koh island and rural farmlands. I hope to raise funds necessary to be ready and open in time for this year’s <strong><i>Kampot Readers &amp; Writers Festival</i></strong> – a major draw card and culture event – on Nov 21-24.<br/><br/>I feel that my plan is carefully budgeted have been working through all costs with my local builder team.  I have already designed and costed a beautiful restaurant venue space by first creating drawings then a foam-core model based on the look of a boat or an art deco diner. It’s a design inspired by the sixties architecture of Cambodia but more so it is a visually attractive structure that can allow for natural garden space and will be something eye-catching and recognizable as a little tribute Cambodia’s Modernist Khmer Nouveau architecture of legendary Khmer architect Van Molyvann (inspired by Le Corbusier). <strong>The Fish Island Arts Centre</strong> will begin life from its specially designed seafood restaurant, and with your help! Evolve into a remarkable location for arts, cuisine, and culture. Please join me and our team in making this wonderful vision possible!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Budget</strong>:</p>
<p>Builder                                                                                   $1300</p>
<p>Materials                                                                                $1700</p>
<p>Kitchen and Bar equipment                                            $1000</p>
<p>Electrician                                                                             $1000<br/><u>                                                                                    Total    $5000</u></p>
<p>Note: I now own the land and have prepared the site with a budget of 20k. We will equip the kitchen, outdoor cinema, and events space using approx 10k equipment currently installed at KAMA cafe.</p>
<h3>Opening the Fish Island Arts Centre seafood restaurant</h3>
<p>I am seeking to raise USD5000 to first build FIAC by completing work on our restaurant and launching by November 20.</p>
<h3>Exciting and Unique Perks</h3>
<p>Together, with my dedicated KAMA team we can offer our supporters some beautiful and unique perks.  This includes, cuisine and culture tours in Kampot, personalized catered dining for you and your guests,  a range of beautiful, locally-made artisanal products, including handprinted bags, woodcut prints, paintings, and of course, delicious locally inspired food!</p>
<h3>The Impact - why my project is valuable and worthwhile.</h3>
<p>This is an initiative to create income, real jobs and training opportunities,  this brings helps us to build a vibrant and creative arts industry and responsible tourism in countryside Cambodia. Now we need your support to take our next big step!</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Explain why your project is valuable to the contributor and to the world.</p></li>
<li>Point out your successful track record with projects like this (if you have one).</li>
<li>Make it real for people and build trust.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I have faced many obstacles in life and have always believed that with hard work and good planning each hurdle can be overcome.  I have established a great team of people and an extended community of great friends and supporters who give me the good advice, strength, and energy to stay the course and meet risks &amp; challenges as they come. </p>

My name is Soon, I grew up in a poor fishing village in Cambodia - food was important, often we did not have enough food, we'd share 1 packet of noodles and rice soup between 4. It was a tough start in life and must have been terribly hard for my mother but I have always dreamed of a better future and have worked hard since a young age to create this. Now I am seeking support to build something incredible - The Fish Island Arts Centre - FIAC is a place to share the story of local cuisine, heritage, art, and culture and create something that builds capacity, knowledge, and self-esteem in the same community where I was born and raised, in Kampot, Cambodia.
2019 has been a good year. In June this year, I was flown to Switzerland and hosted by World Tourism Forum as the winner of a World Tourism Star Award - this award (and support) means a world to me as it’s wonderful recognition and gives me more empowerment to follow my dream. I feel strongly about teaching, employing and sharing skills with disadvantaged women and youth. I am now launching a fundraising campaign to call on friends and supporters to help me build a new restaurant as the first step towards creating the Fish Island International Arts Centre where we can build on all the good work started here at KAMA, Kampot.
I'm a Cambodian woman, a mother, cook, tour guide, entrepreneur (I only recently learned that word) and local businesswoman. When I began work as a child, I'd earn 20cents by cleaning fishing boats plus other jobs like selling cakes door to door - this way I could support my three youngers siblings while my single mother was also away working by collecting seaweed.  
While still in my teens, I was sent away to work as a maid, first unpaid work in Phnom Penh then onto Malaysia where I worked another 8 years, experiencing much isolation, loneliness, and very long hours for little pay - many commentators describe this lowly employment as modern-day slavery.  However, I didn't feel disadvantaged but happy to have work with a kind family who allowed my time off on Sundays to attended courses at a Filipino run church where I was able to gain certificates in baking and other practical areas. Upon my return to Cambodia, I built a family home for my mother and soon opened my own restaurant. There were many hardships with this first venture, not least, taking time off to give birth to my baby girl now 5. Since this time, I've gained much experience and while I shut down my first Cambodian restaurant, I soon found work as manager of a popular café in Kampot, then moved on to become manager and owner of KAMA café. I have created this business as a social enterprise to train and employ more than 30 local women in just four years. During this time I have also established myself as a local artist, specializing in woodcut printmaking, and have had several successful exhibitions, my print artworks often show daily life in Kampot or aspects of my own story and I will offer these art prints at ""perks"" for campaign supporters.
What we're going to do!
We'll get to work on building The Fish Island Arts Centre by first building a restaurant - this entire initiative located out in the middle of Trey Koh island and rural farmlands. I hope to raise funds necessary to be ready and open in time for this year’s Kampot Readers & Writers Festival – a major draw card and culture event – on Nov 21-24.I feel that my plan is carefully budgeted have been working through all costs with my local builder team.  I have already designed and costed a beautiful restaurant venue space by first creating drawings then a foam-core model based on the look of a boat or an art deco diner. It’s a design inspired by the sixties architecture of Cambodia but more so it is a visually attractive structure that can allow for natural garden space and will be something eye-catching and recognizable as a little tribute Cambodia’s Modernist Khmer Nouveau architecture of legendary Khmer architect Van Molyvann (inspired by Le Corbusier). The Fish Island Arts Centre will begin life from its specially designed seafood restaurant, and with your help! Evolve into a remarkable location for arts, cuisine, and culture. Please join me and our team in making this wonderful vision possible!
 
Budget:
Builder                                                                                   $1300
Materials                                                                                $1700
Kitchen and Bar equipment                                            $1000
Electrician                                                                             $1000                                                                                    Total    $5000
Note: I now own the land and have prepared the site with a budget of 20k. We will equip the kitchen, outdoor cinema, and events space using approx 10k equipment currently installed at KAMA cafe.
Opening the Fish Island Arts Centre seafood restaurant
I am seeking to raise USD5000 to first build FIAC by completing work on our restaurant and launching by November 20.

Risks & Challenges
I have faced many obstacles in life and have always believed that with hard work and good planning each hurdle can be overcome.  I have established a great team of people and an extended community of great friends and supporters who give me the good advice, strength, and energy to stay the course and meet risks & challenges as they come. 
Where do the funds go if I don't reach the target?
All funds raised will go towards the building of our restaurant on Fish Island. If I fall short of my goal I will continue to work towards my budget by offering attractive perks and attracting income through tour bookings and sales of my artworks. However, as this will take time and my first concern is ongoing employment for my staff as well as creating a social enterprise to build Fish Island Arts Centre, I have launched this campaign and reaching out for your support.

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Creatives all around the world need spaces and time to get inspired and share experiences. For the past years, we have been visiting international communities and places where such magic happens. Early this year, we landed in Brivezac, a rural land of beautiful Southern France, where the local community is longing for a richer cultural life, creative experiments and social initiatives of all sorts to create long lasting bonds between people. Ever since we discovered this quiet corner of the planet, we are suprised daily by the warm welcome and participative approach of everyone living around. We want to enrich the collective landscape of the region. We want to open it to creatives learners from all over the world. Homade is doing just that. It brings together international creative energetic contributors and shapes a collaborative dynamic benefiting everyone involved. Multicultural, pluridisciplinary and intergenerational, Homade is welcoming anyone who wants to play, learn, create and share!</span></p>

Creatives all around the world need spaces and time to get inspired and share experiences. For the past years, we have been visiting international communities and places where such magic happens. Early this year, we landed in Brivezac, a rural land of beautiful Southern France, where the local community is longing for a richer cultural life, creative experiments and social initiatives of all sorts to create long lasting bonds between people. Ever since we discovered this quiet corner of the planet, we are suprised daily by the warm welcome and participative approach of everyone living around. We want to enrich the collective landscape of the region. We want to open it to creatives learners from all over the world. Homade is doing just that. It brings together international creative energetic contributors and shapes a collaborative dynamic benefiting everyone involved. Multicultural, pluridisciplinary and intergenerational, Homade is welcoming anyone who wants to play, learn, create and share!

<h3>The Farm</h3>
<p>Shao Shan Farm is located on 5.5 beautiful acres in West Marin County, CA. ""Shao Shan"" means little/youthful mountain and comes from my Chinese name Zhang Shao Shan (张少山). The mission of the farm is to grow Chinese heritage vegetables for the Bay Area Asian American/Pacific Islander (AAPI) community using practices that are beneficial to the land and the people who are working it. . This Spring we will be breaking ground on 1.5-acres and begin selling to a group of AAPI chefs who are passionate about linking heritage to ethical and sustainable sources. We will also be working with Chinese community groups in Marin, San Francisco, and the East Bay to grow food and medicinal plants, host tours and workshops, and distribute seeds to the community.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1547500994/rkrtas6qmpmhq5mthpuo.png"" src=""""/></p>

<h3>Why is it important?</h3>
<p>The Farm is the product of a personal exploration of heritage and identity. Food and farming serves as a focused lens to explore large, and sometimes abstract, concepts like assimilation, multiracial identity, racism, and environmental degradation. We believe that interacting with the land and crops is an effective way to take these concepts and make them into something tangible.</p>
<p>In a country where Asian Americans comprise <a href=""https://www.nass.usda.gov/Publications/Highlights/2014/Highlights_Asian_Farmers.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>less than 1%</strong></a> of our farmers, we hope that having AAPI representation in sustainable agriculture can inspire more young farmers, chefs, and entrepreneurs to develop their personal narrative and relationship to heritage and food.</p>
<p>Shao Shan Farm plans to support AAPI foodways work through employing beginning Asian American farmers, generating grower guides/video resources, and growing food, medicinal plants, and seeds for Chinese community groups. </p>

<h3>The Farmer: Scott Chang-Fleeman</h3>
<p>I was born and raised in West Los Angeles, far from anything that resembled a farm. As a biracial, 3rd generation American, I did not grow up with a strong connection to my Chinese American identity and have grappled with finding an identity that feels ""whole"" despite the unavoidable label of ""half."" My interest and passion for farming was sparked during my undergrad at UC Santa Cruz, and flourished as an apprentice at the <a href=""https://casfs.ucsc.edu/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems</a> where I was given the resources to pursue my interest in cultivating Chinese vegetables in a community of farmers that were also linking their identities to the land. Shao Shan Farm is a deeply personal project and a land based manifestation of committing to celebrating my whole identity.</p>

<h3>Why We Need Your Help</h3>
<p>Starting a farm requires a lot of up front investment. Equipment, seeds, tools, and infrastructure have to be purchased before crops are even in the ground. As a brand new farm we are unable to access many of the grants and loans that existing farms use to cover operating expenses and purchase new equipment. Being a first generation farmer also means we do not have access to family land and equipment.</p>
<p>We are fortunate to have found a parcel of land that has been farmed incredibly well for the last 7 years. There is existing fencing, irrigation, and greenhouse infrastructure that we are purchasing from the outgoing farmer. This infrastructure is not cheap, but it will allow us to start farming right away in the Spring without having to build a farm from the ground up.</p>
<p>Your contribution will go directly towards everything we need to get started. 1/3 of the funds will go towards a down payment on the infrastructure, and the other 2/3 will go towards everything from tractor equipment to rubber bands. We are incredibly thankful for your support and Happy Lunar New Year! </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Creative Rural Hub is founded by a group of friends - makers, designers, architects, artists. It is located in the small village Verhnij Verbizh in Ivano Frankivsk district, Ukraine. Western Ukraine is famous for its craftsmanship, rich cultural inheritance and beautiful nature of Carpathian Mountains. Living in this environment is inspiring and enriching, and it gives the chance to learn local crafts and discover Ukraine. This project will help to link international and local creatives, providing the space for learning, working together and exchanging experiences and knowledge.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1500337953/eaq493rwflavqsasnbur.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>What we already have</h3>
<p>We have an amazing team of people combined from local and international artists, craftsmen, designers and architects. We have all worked really hard to bring the project to life. With their ongoing enthusiasm, dedication and passion we believe we can take the project much further. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1498317309/dzcvq4ikds4vnggip1hn.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Our team members:</p>
<ul>
<li>Michael Obrizkiv - designer, maker, artist</li>
<li>Yvona Nov - graphic designer, illustrator, maker</li>
<li>Evgenia Gonchar - architect</li>
<li>Nazar Lypchuk - architect</li>
<li>Natalia Obrizkiv - artist, textile designer</li>
<li>Volodymyr Kravtsiv - metal and glass craftsman, art teacher</li>
<li>Iryna Kolotylo - art curator</li>
<li>Nomeda Ciurlionyte - artist, painter, art teacher</li>
<li>Roman Dovhaniuk - wood craftsman, dj</li>
<li>Anastasia Obrizkiv - designer, architect</li>
<li>Emilia Ochocka -  agriculturist</li>
<li>your name here - we want our team to grow and we are open for your ideas</li>
</ul>
<p>Our great advantage is the ownership of the land, which can provide long term security for the Creative Rural Hub. There is an old traditional Ukrainian house, a barn, a well and an amazing 60 year old apple orchard. The property is well linked to public transport but at the same time secluded from the main roads. It is in the centre of the village and within walking distance from historic town Kolomyia.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1498228016/mnhlz959ubo7ziysrsfr.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What we will use the money for</h3>
<p>In order for the space to be able to host its first residents we will need to create basic infrastructure (water system, toilets, kitchen etc.) and renovate the old house. We will also focus on building new space where we can hold workshops and events. It will be 10m diameter geodesic dome shell. </p>
<p>In August we are organising a build camp, where with the help of volunteers and professionals the initial set of works will be completed. The money that we will raise will help to provide materials, specialised labour and to hire craftsmen that would help us with the coordination of our build camp.</p>
<p>Part of the money will also go towards launching Creative Residency particularly focusing on artists with socially and ecologically beneficial projects.</p>
<p>The funding will go towards:</p>
<ul>
<li>materials for restoration works of the old house and the barn</li>
<li>restoration of the well </li>
<li>building integrated water management system (grey water system)</li>
<li>creating high tech eco-friendly composting toilet</li>
<li>fixing the fence</li>
<li>buying sustainably sourced wood for geodesic dome  </li>
<li>hiring professional craftsmen who will lead the works and help to manage the build camp</li>
<li>launching Creative Residency </li>
</ul>
<p>Even if only the part of the goal is met, we will still use all raised funds to start work on the project. </p>

<p> </p>
<h3>Future plans</h3>
<p>From our experience working in creative industries in London, we know innovations happen when creatives from different backgrounds get together. By removing the borders between specialities and countries we have the opportunity to work on real life problems. To enable this creative collaboration we would like to start a number of initiatives in Creative Rural Hub in the nearest future:</p>
<ul>

</div></div>","Short Summary
Creative Rural Hub is founded by a group of friends - makers, designers, architects, artists. It is located in the small village Verhnij Verbizh in Ivano Frankivsk district, Ukraine. Western Ukraine is famous for its craftsmanship, rich cultural inheritance and beautiful nature of Carpathian Mountains. Living in this environment is inspiring and enriching, and it gives the chance to learn local crafts and discover Ukraine. This project will help to link international and local creatives, providing the space for learning, working together and exchanging experiences and knowledge.

What we already have
We have an amazing team of people combined from local and international artists, craftsmen, designers and architects. We have all worked really hard to bring the project to life. With their ongoing enthusiasm, dedication and passion we believe we can take the project much further. 

Our team members:

Michael Obrizkiv - designer, maker, artist
Yvona Nov - graphic designer, illustrator, maker
Evgenia Gonchar - architect
Nazar Lypchuk - architect
Natalia Obrizkiv - artist, textile designer
Volodymyr Kravtsiv - metal and glass craftsman, art teacher
Iryna Kolotylo - art curator
Nomeda Ciurlionyte - artist, painter, art teacher
Roman Dovhaniuk - wood craftsman, dj
Anastasia Obrizkiv - designer, architect
Emilia Ochocka -  agriculturist
your name here - we want our team to grow and we are open for your ideas

Our great advantage is the ownership of the land, which can provide long term security for the Creative Rural Hub. There is an old traditional Ukrainian house, a barn, a well and an amazing 60 year old apple orchard. The property is well linked to public transport but at the same time secluded from the main roads. It is in the centre of the village and within walking distance from historic town Kolomyia.

 

What we will use the money for
In order for the space to be able to host its first residents we will need to create basic infrastructure (water system, toilets, kitchen etc.) and renovate the old house. We will also focus on building new space where we can hold workshops and events. It will be 10m diameter geodesic dome shell. 
In August we are organising a build camp, where with the help of volunteers and professionals the initial set of works will be completed. The money that we will raise will help to provide materials, specialised labour and to hire craftsmen that would help us with the coordination of our build camp.
Part of the money will also go towards launching Creative Residency particularly focusing on artists with socially and ecologically beneficial projects.
The funding will go towards:

materials for restoration works of the old house and the barn
restoration of the well 
building integrated water management system (grey water system)
creating high tech eco-friendly composting toilet
fixing the fence
buying sustainably sourced wood for geodesic dome  
hiring professional craftsmen who will lead the works and help to manage the build camp
launching Creative Residency 

Even if only the part of the goal is met, we will still use all raised funds to start work on the project. 



 
Future plans
From our experience working in creative industries in London, we know innovations happen when creatives from different backgrounds get together. By removing the borders between specialities and countries we have the opportunity to work on real life problems. To enable this creative collaboration we would like to start a number of initiatives in Creative Rural Hub in the nearest future:

Creative residency 
Maker space
Learning space (workshops, classroom, library)
Working space (co-working, studios)
Accommodation (camping, art hostel )
Permaculture Lab
Seed bank
Organic Cafe
Gallery
Library of things
Your idea here

All those ideas can complement each other we have enough land to fit it all! 

 
What will you get
The most important thing that we want to offer is an opportunity to be part of creating this ever growing project right from the start. By participating in this project you get the chance to learn new skills in sustainable future workshops, and share your experience and input with us.

graphic and digital design (taught by Open Design School)
lighting design 


You will also get the chance to experience the tranquillity of rural area and the beauty of Carpathian Mountains.
We have prepared all sorts of rewards - from small art prints and geodesic lampshades to accommodation and future workshops and events in our space. They are all made by the members of our team and are directly linked to the Creative Rural Hub.

Risks & Challenges
Entrepreneurship is difficult in general and social enterprise in particular. While we have a great team and support of local family and friends we don't have financial security. We own the land but need to build sustainable financial model for the space to function, and offer free and paid creative opportunities. We hope to overcome this with your support and a support of other partner organisations.  
Build camp this summer will be the first this kind of event we will organise, hence we seek professional advise when possible, and people with experience in similar events. 
 
Money is not the main thing

Besides raising so much needed funds, campaign is created for raising awareness and building connections with future participants and supporters.

</ol></div>","Help us build the Statue of Liberty Museum!The Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island Foundation, Campaign Chairperson Diane von Furstenberg, and the National Park Service are in the process of creating a new museum on Liberty Island, but we need your help to add the finishing touches.With your support, future visitors to Liberty Island will be able to explore the Statue's inspiring story through the Museum's interactive galleries and special exhibits.The Museum will also be the new home for her original torch and the Liberty Star Mural, a panoramic display containing the names of many of the Museum's generous donors along with the Founders Star, a digital donor registry of people like you who have supported the Museum.The existing exhibit inside the pedestal of the Statue of Liberty can only accommodate a fraction of the island’s over four million annual visitors.The new 26,000-square-foot museum will create a beautiful, sustainable, new destination on Liberty Island, giving all visitors the ability to explore the Statue's inspiring story without the need for additional advanced reservations or tickets.The Museum features a green roofscape with native island vegetation and bird-safe glass exteriors. It is set above 500-year flood levels and built to withstand hurricane-force winds.The Museum will also be the new home for her original torch and the Liberty Star Mural. Inspired by the American flag, the Liberty Star Mural features 50 sculpted stars designed by French-American artist Anh Duong and includes the Founders Star.The stars are offset by original hand-forged iron armature bars that supported the interior of the Statue of Liberty for her first 100 years. Designed by Gustave Eiffel, these unique pieces were preserved from the Statue’s 1986 centennial restoration.When guests of the island look upon the Statue of Liberty, they think about her historical connection to liberty, freedom, and the American Dream, but few know she inspired one of America's first crowdfunding campaigns.In 1885, Joseph Pulitzer placed an ad in his paper, The New York World , inviting readers to come together and donate to help complete the Statue's pedestal in exchange for rewards based on their level of contribution. The public rose to the challenge with 120,000 people donating over $100,000.Thanks to Pulitzer's campaign, Lady Liberty stands on her pedestal as arguably one of the most recognizable figures around the globe.Now, 134 years later, Lady Liberty needs the people's help once more.Just as Pulitzer recognized contributors in his newspaper, every contributor to this campaign will be recognized through social media shout outs.Depending on your level of contribution, you could receive amazing perks like a limited-edition campaign medallion, an invitation to be here on the island when the torch moves to its new home, exclusive items and experiences donated by our partners, and much more.Best of all, everyone who makes a contribution of $19--symbolic of 1886, the year the Statue of Liberty was dedicated-- or more will have their name permanently recorded in our Founders Registry when the Museum opens in 2019 and listed on the Museum website after the campaign ends.Just as people helped to make her pedestal a reality over 130 years ago, we hope that this vision for the new Statue of Liberty Museum will inspire your generosity to become part of her legacy.$19 - Founders Registry RecognitionYour $19 contribution is symbolic of 1886, the year the Statue of Liberty was dedicated.

<h2><strong>The very first fully functional skate park in the heart of Accra</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Surf Ghana,  a skateboarding and surf collective dedicated to galvanize the burgeoning skateboarding scene in Ghana, teamed up with Limbo Accra, Wonders around the World, and Space Accra to build Freedom skate park,  the country's very first fully functional skate park in the heart of  Accra</p>
<p>The collective has an intent to create social change in Ghana. For 4 consistent years, we have focused on building a creative and inclusive community.</p>
<p>Our message is simple: Anything is possible, and through skateboarding, the youth can learn that we are not defined by perceived obstacles, but that we can find meaning in our ability to adapt to them. That is what skateboarding is truly about and for us; it is more than just skateboarding but the synergy between the arts: music, graffiti, photography, writing, styling, and carpentry as a way to campaign for a healthy body and mind, sound education, and social awareness.</p>
<p> </p>

</div><div>
<h2>Why are we doing this?</h2>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Sports infrastructures are still a luxury in West Africa</strong></p>
<p>Ghana has the most progressive skateboarding scene in West Africa. However, at the present moment, there are no sports infrastructures dedicated to the practice of skateboarding.</p>
<p>Access to sports clubs cost between 25 to 50% of the average Ghanaian's monthly salary compared to 3% in Europe. Quality sports infrastructures are limited and often belong to private schools or universities. The access is restricted.</p> <p><strong>Ghana's youth unemployment rate one of the highest worldwide</strong></p>
<p>Nearly 60% of the unemployed in Ghana are at their young age. Youth unemployment in Ghana is mainly concentrated in urban cities. In Accra, the nation's capital, the unemployment rate is about 30.8%. It involves the risk of isolation and social exclusion, and deteriorating effects on personal life and well-being.</p> <p><strong>Art, Sports &amp; Culture public institutions don't provide entrepreneurship programs</strong></p>
<p>Most of the initiatives are private, limited &amp; provided by NGOs that give emergency responses that cannot guarantee sustainable vision.</p> <h2>Our ambition</h2>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>A sports and art hub to empower the creative youth of Accra</strong></p>
<p>As more than just a simple skate ramp, Freedom Skate Park will include coaching programs, art workshops, a Wi-Fi cafe, and the country's very first skate shop, to connect young Ghanaians and develop creative possibilities in an environment that promotes inclusivity.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1614218513/eu8gvkaih8krgfnuexpk.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>A new sports ecosystem that supports well-being, creativity, and entrepreneurship</strong></p>
<p>Since 2016, Surf Ghana's core mission has been to offer easy access to board sports for youth across Ghana. Presently, the ever-growing community of active skateboarders has created an ecosystem that supports well-being, creativity, and entrepreneurship that is all 100% made in Ghana. We aim to use the inclusiveness of board sports as a bridge to urban sports life for Ghana's most marginalized local population.</p>
<p>We believe that the construction of Freedom Skate Park will solidify the growth of board sports in Ghana, and help the youth participate in creative activities that build confidence, self-esteem and provide a valuable platform for self-expression.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1614218629/asmzxwpwtq5qvaxl1saz.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>A skate park to improve African representation in board sports</strong></p>
<p>Surf Ghana also wishes to encourage the space as a training ground for Ghana's possible inclusion in the skateboarding category of the 2024 Olympic Games and international competition.</p>

<p>Design studio <strong>Limbo Accra</strong> is on hand for creative direction as the architectural lead, with a mission to ""deliver afro-utopian spatial justice for all,"" an urban ecosystem in harmony with its local population.</p>
<p>Limbo Accra's core goals of sustainable, redistributive, and community-led development are all met with Freedom Skate Park; challenging Ghana's urban development sector to embrace new models that create meaningful opportunities for the youth through novel architectural designs.</p>
<p>Limbo Accra's spatial design team, in collaboration with Surf Ghana and Wonders Around the World, brings forth the visionary design for Freedom Skate Park. The park is the first of its kind as it bridges the gap in the recreational landscape in Accra, by creating both a space for skateboarders and the community at large.</p>
<p>The community-led design process has informed the programming. The park has a moldable art space, a community planted green area, and a co-working hub. Built with contemporary and ancient techniques, the park is imagined to be a bustling space and a new urban site for the whole of Ghana: inspired globally - created locally.</p>

<p>- With this initiative, we hope to evolve the skate culture in Ghana to the next level and give locals a platform to grow their talents within a space that will hopefully become their biggest training ground to date. More than board sports, the park will be a creative hub for young Ghanaians to come together, exchange ideas, inspire each other and build their futures through recreational activities. They now have a place where they can be themselves, freely develop their skills together with like-minded people and reach their true potential.

</div></div>","The very first fully functional skate park in the heart of Accra
 
Surf Ghana,  a skateboarding and surf collective dedicated to galvanize the burgeoning skateboarding scene in Ghana, teamed up with Limbo Accra, Wonders around the World, and Space Accra to build Freedom skate park,  the country's very first fully functional skate park in the heart of  Accra
The collective has an intent to create social change in Ghana. For 4 consistent years, we have focused on building a creative and inclusive community.
Our message is simple: Anything is possible, and through skateboarding, the youth can learn that we are not defined by perceived obstacles, but that we can find meaning in our ability to adapt to them. That is what skateboarding is truly about and for us; it is more than just skateboarding but the synergy between the arts: music, graffiti, photography, writing, styling, and carpentry as a way to campaign for a healthy body and mind, sound education, and social awareness.
 


Why are we doing this?
 
Sports infrastructures are still a luxury in West Africa
Ghana has the most progressive skateboarding scene in West Africa. However, at the present moment, there are no sports infrastructures dedicated to the practice of skateboarding.
Access to sports clubs cost between 25 to 50% of the average Ghanaian's monthly salary compared to 3% in Europe. Quality sports infrastructures are limited and often belong to private schools or universities. The access is restricted. Ghana's youth unemployment rate one of the highest worldwide
Nearly 60% of the unemployed in Ghana are at their young age. Youth unemployment in Ghana is mainly concentrated in urban cities. In Accra, the nation's capital, the unemployment rate is about 30.8%. It involves the risk of isolation and social exclusion, and deteriorating effects on personal life and well-being. Art, Sports & Culture public institutions don't provide entrepreneurship programs
Most of the initiatives are private, limited & provided by NGOs that give emergency responses that cannot guarantee sustainable vision. Our ambition
 
A sports and art hub to empower the creative youth of Accra
As more than just a simple skate ramp, Freedom Skate Park will include coaching programs, art workshops, a Wi-Fi cafe, and the country's very first skate shop, to connect young Ghanaians and develop creative possibilities in an environment that promotes inclusivity.

A new sports ecosystem that supports well-being, creativity, and entrepreneurship
Since 2016, Surf Ghana's core mission has been to offer easy access to board sports for youth across Ghana. Presently, the ever-growing community of active skateboarders has created an ecosystem that supports well-being, creativity, and entrepreneurship that is all 100% made in Ghana. We aim to use the inclusiveness of board sports as a bridge to urban sports life for Ghana's most marginalized local population.
We believe that the construction of Freedom Skate Park will solidify the growth of board sports in Ghana, and help the youth participate in creative activities that build confidence, self-esteem and provide a valuable platform for self-expression.

A skate park to improve African representation in board sports
Surf Ghana also wishes to encourage the space as a training ground for Ghana's possible inclusion in the skateboarding category of the 2024 Olympic Games and international competition.

About Surf Ghana Collective
 

 
Our active members
 

 
Surf Ghana collective is a social platform founded in 2016 by Sandy Alibo and registered as a non-profit and non-governmental organization. The collective aims to use the practice of board sports as a driver for education, social inclusion, and empowerment for the youth. The collective curates events, and offers sports experiences. With a total of 25 active members, the collective contributes to action sports as instructors, documentary filmmakers, photographers, carpenters, 3D designers, writers, and artists. The collective plans to train members to lead a consistent and safe skateboarding program in the future skate park.

Our construction partners
 
Design studio Limbo Accra is on hand for creative direction as the architectural lead, with a mission to ""deliver afro-utopian spatial justice for all,"" an urban ecosystem in harmony with its local population.
Limbo Accra's core goals of sustainable, redistributive, and community-led development are all met with Freedom Skate Park; challenging Ghana's urban development sector to embrace new models that create meaningful opportunities for the youth through novel architectural designs.
Limbo Accra's spatial design team, in collaboration with Surf Ghana and Wonders Around the World, brings forth the visionary design for Freedom Skate Park. The park is the first of its kind as it bridges the gap in the recreational landscape in Accra, by creating both a space for skateboarders and the community at large.
The community-led design process has informed the programming. The park has a moldable art space, a community planted green area, and a co-working hub. Built with contemporary and ancient techniques, the park is imagined to be a bustling space and a new urban site for the whole of Ghana: inspired globally - created locally.

WAW - Wonders Around the World is a NGO charitable organization built to help make skateboarding accessible worldwide, mainly by developing skateparks in underrepresented areas of the world and supporting the communities pivoting around them. 
By developing these public sanctuaries in close cooperation with local partners, WAW provides the communities with the tools and continuous support to independently and successfully manage their facilities, offering the best outcome and defining the statement ‘It’s their park’.
Surf Ghana’s Freedom skatepark is designed and will be built in close cooperation with the native skateboarders, Surf Ghana, Space Accra and Limbo Accra.

Maybe we can reach $20,000 or, even, $40,000. With the extra security, we’d have more capacity to do great work. Please be part of our Love Story. Your investment will allow us to keep the space thriving for years to come.</p>
<p><strong>REQUEST #1: </strong>Please donate what you can. Every dollar gets us closer to our goal.</p>
<p><strong>REQUEST #2:</strong> Spread the word! Please help us spread the word by sharing the campaign on social media or with your friends and family via email or text and encouraging them to give too! Let them know why you love Studio Grand and what we’re up to.</p>
<p><strong>REQUEST #3:</strong> If you get paid again and have room to give, please donate again!!<strong> =)</strong></p>
<p><strong>REQUEST #4: </strong>Drop by and say hi. We’d love to see you!! &lt;3<br/> </p>
<p><strong>ABOUT STUDIO GRAND:</strong><br/><br/>Studio Grand is a non-profit community arts space located in the Grand Lake neighborhood of Oakland. The space hosts music, theater, dance and literary performances; classes for children and adults; art exhibitions; and free community events. It is a warm and inviting space that presents quality events that reflect and serve the diverse communities that define the Bay Area.</p>
<p>A central part of our mission is to maintain an affordable space in the heart of Oakland -- a place of respite; a space that brings joy; a venue for creative experimentation, new compositions, cultural celebrations, and more. We respect and love the cultural mosaic of Oakland and make sure that the space is reflective of this diversity.</p>
<p>The Studio is primarily volunteer-run. We have a wonderful group of teachers, hosts, and curators who bring dynamic programming to the space. Studio Grand prioritizes getting money into artists’ hands, while simultaneously keeping the lights on and keeping our programming affordable. All of our performances are either free or available on a sliding scale basis, with no one turned away for lack of funds. We also love to watch artists grow and develop, so we help them build their capacity to secure grants and gain more visibility for their work.  </p> <p><strong>HOW STUDIO GRAND CAME TO BE:</strong></p>
<p>In 2013, local teacher and multidisciplinary artist Holly Schneider opened Studio Grand. Having lived in Oakland for many years, Holly had a deep love for the City. She noticed that many art and cultural spaces were either closing their doors or were struggling to stay open. Holly also raised her son in Oakland. He’s now a budding young musician with a great jazz trio that has created their own sound. Lookup <a href=""http://www.oaklandfuturetrio.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Oakland Future Trio</a>!</p>
<p>She had always dreamt of having a space that could house a variety of creative disciplines, allow artists to experiment with their work, and also bring people from different backgrounds together to connect. She chose the Grand Lake Neighborhood both because she felt the neighborhood needed more family-friendly arts programming and because she felt the many talented artists in her orbit needed a more visible, above-ground location to present their work.</p>
<p>In May of 2014, we lost Holly to a very quick battle with cancer. She was very much loved by many. She always extended her heart and time to encourage others to live to their fullest. This tragedy hit hard for those who knew her for years and those who had just met her through the space.</p>
<p>When she passed, eight months after opening the doors, there was already a vibrant community around Studio Grand. It was obvious that she created something special. In order to honor Holly and her vision, her community decided to keep the space open and, since then, it has been run by her friend and colleague Vanessa Camarena-Arredondo in collaboration with a group of wonderful curators and volunteers.</p>
<p>In the fall of 2016, with a ton of sweat equity put in by friends, family, artists, Studio Grand curators, and volunteers, we turned three and signed a three-year lease to secure our space in Oakland and continue serving the community.  <br/> </p>
<p><strong>WHY YOUR SUPPORT HELPS:</strong></p>
<p>As a non-profit space located in a bustling commercial business district, support from our community is what will keep us alive in an increasingly expensive region. We’ve included some of our expenses below for you to see what your hard-earned dollars will support.</p>
<p>Donations of all amounts are welcome and appreciated. Spreading the message by sharing the campaign with your friends and loved ones will extend our reach. When you share the campaign, please let people know what the space means to you and how it has impacted you. So many of you are part of our story whether it’s because you’ve joined us for a show, several shows, dance classes, exhibition openings, community events, or just wandered into the space.</p>
<p>We realize it’s ambitious but if we reach our goal of $15,000 or surpass it and get to $20,000, $30,000, $40,000, we’d not only be able to secure the space but with the extra padding, we’d have more capacity to expand our reach. Help us grow our possibilities by investing in both our present and  future; your investment will allow us to keep the space open and thriving for many years to come.</p>

<h2>Our Project</h2>
<p>Due to the enormous amount of firings, the arch of our salt kiln has nearly collapsed, and the walls are starting to buckle. After consulting several experts and kiln builders, we have reached our decision: It is time to rebuild! We would like to construct the best new salt kiln in the area, to be used over the coming decades for educational purposes. </p>
<p>We've enlisted the best.  Master kiln builder Shane Mickey designed our new kiln and was able to utilize the chimney and kiln pad from the old unit, which will save both time and material cost. Shane’s design will also  increase the stacking area, allowing us to include more student pots in each firing.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1552338003/iniivyfrhlmvrkg06u29.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h2>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h2>
<ul>
<li>The project requires over 500 hard bricks, a channel iron armature, two new Mb-400 burners, shelving, and design for a material cost of $8,236. We will do all of the labor ourselves, using the construction of the kiln as an educational opportunity for our students.</li>
<li>To show our thanks for your contribution, we are offering a sneak peak at our new line of Odyssey merch!  Be the first to own the super soft Odyssey hoodie or t-shirt. Or get one of our new aprons, great for the clay studio or the kitchen!  We are extremely thankful to graphic designer Micah Yaple, who created the imagery for our line based on the work of several Odyssey Artists.<ul>
<li>For a $25 donation, we’ll send you our newly designed bumper sticker.</li>
<li>$50 gets you the t-shirt of your choice (mens, boxy or womens, fitted, sizes sm-xl)</li>
<li>$100 perks are these great pocketed aprons. One size fits all.</li>
<li>$250 donation comes with a soft, fleece hoodie, sizes sm-2xl</li>
<li>$500 come with a free 2 hour private lesson at Odyssey for 2 people, a $150 value.</li>
<li>$1000 comes with a free class at Odyssey, a value of $360.</li>

<h2>Who We Are</h2>
<p>Founded in 1994 by Brian and Gail McCarthy, the studio quickly gained a reputation for offering dynamic classes and workshops with the best national and international ceramic artists.</p>
<p>Longtime Odyssey instructor Gabriel Kline purchased the business from the McCarthys in late 2012. Kline has since expanded the programs to include work with veterans suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and traumatic brain injury (TBI), at-risk youth, substance and alcohol abuse recovery programs, and developmentally disabled adults. Odyssey ClayWorks operates on the principle that access to the creative arts should be the right of all individuals and is integral to their health. Odyssey ClayWorks has been recognized as one of the foremost ceramics studios in the country. Director Gabriel Kline is one of the recipients of Asheville’s 40 under 40 Awards for his contributions to the community.</p>

<h2>Ways You Can Help</h2>
<ul>
<li>Contribute! Our goal is to raise $9000 to cover the material costs of rebuilding the salt kiln. We have some tremendous perks at all different donation levels.

<li>Help us spread the word! Reposting about the campaign on your social media accounts is the single best way we can help to get the word out about our campaign. We will be using facebook, Twitter, and Instagram regularly to update the status of the project. Thanks in advance for helping us to get the word out.</li>

<h3 style=""margin-left:40px;"">Producción de un nuevo EP</h3>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Mi nombre artístico es Toni Dublet. La música que interpreto son composiciones propias con melodías muy personales y distintas a lo acostumbrado en el género del cantautor</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Anteriormente, durante cuatro años, fui vocalista del grupo de Rock alternativo REIN con raíz en Linares. Además también fui vocalista de un grupo de versiones de los 60, 70, 80 y 90 llamado VAHO.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">El proyecto Dublet comienza en 2016 con la disolución de REIN. Al encontrarme con la necesidad de llevar acompañamiento musical, sentí la ""obligación"" de aprender a tocar la guitarra y de esa manera seguir componiendo de forma independiente. He decir que la decisión fue de gran acierto.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Actualmente dispongo de una maqueta autoproducida llamada <strong>""Un Nuevo Comienzo""</strong>, la cual  ya está disponible en plataformas como Youtube, Amazon, iTunes, Spotify, Google Play, etc.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">En Youtube también está disponible el nuevo tema <strong>Humo, sangre y sed</strong>, producido en los estudios de La Viña (Baeza) donde grabaría el EP completo.</p>
<div style=""margin-left:40px;""><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/8rU41zbFKOk?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""><br/></iframe></div></div>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""> </p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><u>Los grupos que más me influencian musicalmente son</u>:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>- Foo Fighters, Beatles, Vetusta Morla, Nirvana, Paolo Nutini, The Struts, Rozalén, Rufus Wainwright, Robbie Williams, MUSE, Adele, Leiva, Raphael, etc.</i></p>
<p style=""margin-left:80px;""> </p>
<h3 style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>OBJETIVOS DEL CROWDFUNDING</strong></h3>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">El objetivo principal de este crowdfunding es desarrollar un proyecto musical a nivel de estudio que difiera de cualquier autoproducción casera realizada hasta el momento</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">El escenario musical actual exige de una alta profesionalidad en las producciones, arrastrando consigo una importante inversión de capital del que no dispongo</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Esta situación económica bloquea cualquier posibilidad de afrontar numerosos gastos demandados durante el proyecto, tales como, grabación en estudio, promoción publicidad, etc.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><u>De este modo la ayuda económica iría destinada a los siguientes puntos:</u></p>
<ol>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;""><p><i>Grabación de un EP con la calidad de un estudio profesional</i></p></li>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;""><p><i>Grabación de videoclips para la promoción en redes sociales, youtube, medios de comunicación televisivos, etc</i></p></li>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;""><p><i>Gira, a nivel nacional, con la que promocionar mi trabajo como músico</i></p></li>
</ol>
</div><div>
<p> </p>

Mi nombre artístico es Toni Dublet. La música que interpreto son composiciones propias con melodías muy personales y distintas a lo acostumbrado en el género del cantautor
Anteriormente, durante cuatro años, fui vocalista del grupo de Rock alternativo REIN con raíz en Linares. Además también fui vocalista de un grupo de versiones de los 60, 70, 80 y 90 llamado VAHO.
El proyecto Dublet comienza en 2016 con la disolución de REIN. Al encontrarme con la necesidad de llevar acompañamiento musical, sentí la ""obligación"" de aprender a tocar la guitarra y de esa manera seguir componiendo de forma independiente. He decir que la decisión fue de gran acierto.
Actualmente dispongo de una maqueta autoproducida llamada ""Un Nuevo Comienzo"", la cual  ya está disponible en plataformas como Youtube, Amazon, iTunes, Spotify, Google Play, etc.
En Youtube también está disponible el nuevo tema Humo, sangre y sed, producido en los estudios de La Viña (Baeza) donde grabaría el EP completo.

 
Los grupos que más me influencian musicalmente son:
- Foo Fighters, Beatles, Vetusta Morla, Nirvana, Paolo Nutini, The Struts, Rozalén, Rufus Wainwright, Robbie Williams, MUSE, Adele, Leiva, Raphael, etc.
 
OBJETIVOS DEL CROWDFUNDING
El objetivo principal de este crowdfunding es desarrollar un proyecto musical a nivel de estudio que difiera de cualquier autoproducción casera realizada hasta el momento
El escenario musical actual exige de una alta profesionalidad en las producciones, arrastrando consigo una importante inversión de capital del que no dispongo
Esta situación económica bloquea cualquier posibilidad de afrontar numerosos gastos demandados durante el proyecto, tales como, grabación en estudio, promoción publicidad, etc.
De este modo la ayuda económica iría destinada a los siguientes puntos:

Grabación de un EP con la calidad de un estudio profesional
Grabación de videoclips para la promoción en redes sociales, youtube, medios de comunicación televisivos, etc
Gira, a nivel nacional, con la que promocionar mi trabajo como músico

People will also have to push themselves outside of their comfort zone to get the best out of the event. We have some special activities planned to support people with this.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Live on Washington, celebrating its 7th year, at the Neutral Zone teen center in Ann Arbor supports 45 high schoolers to meet Sept-June to plan this massive celebration of young artists.</p>
<p>This year's event is happening on Saturday, June 8th, from 3-11 p.m. on Washington Street in front of Neutral Zone.</p>
<p>Live on Washington teens curate this free and open to the public arts and music festival.  Two stages will feature 24 different teen performing groups ranging from poets to dance groups, jazz bands to rock bands, rappers, DJs and more.</p> <p>Teens learn to recruit, book and host touring headliners. The guest headliners this year are TV Girl (Los Angeles) and Kayo Genesis (NYC).   </p> <p>We need your help to pay for the stage, the lighting, the sound equipment and the licenses that are all necessary for this unique festival.  So far teens have met with corporate donors, organized fundraiser concerts, hosted a thrift store fundraiser, solicited donations from local businesses and planned a gala event for May 11th. Our total budget for the festival is $50,000 and we have already raised about $36,000 - this campaign is part of our plan to get us the rest of the way there!   </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We will need a total of about $50,000 to fund the stage, sound, street permits, staffing, and to help us present headlining artists.  We have already raised about $36,000 towards our goal. This campaign’s goal of $4,000, will help us raise the rest of the funds we need.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We have some hard costs for</p>
<p>-staging, audio/visual support for our street party</p>
<p>-blocking off the street </p>
<p>-renting tents and logistical production pieces</p>
<p>-artist payments to our headliners </p>
<p>-marketing efforts</p>
<p>-staff time supporting through the year and day of</p>
<p>We are doing this as cheaply and professionally as we can!  Our team of youth curators is a volunteer, self selecting group of young people participating in the program.  We also use volunteer time day of the festival - get in contact with liveonwashington@gmail.com if you'd like to be involved! </p>
<p>You will get the satisfaction of knowing you are helping to empower local teens; giving them leadership skills and experience, and supporting them in to have their voices heard in our community.  Last year over 80 youth performed in 24 different groups for 2,000 people in our audiences.</p>
<p>Check out the giving options for cool prizes and incentives.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Young musicians NEED to have spaces to perform art that are safe, sober, and inclusive.  Live On Washington aims to be a radically inclusive festival, presenting for and of a broad cross section of the community.   Performers and presenters gain real world experiences that help </p>
<p>Teen team members learn practices of curating and production they will take into their lives to be catalysts of their communities. They learn to design programing, build community partnerships, book and market artists, and to do production day of the event. We are aim to support the community changers of tomorrow by supporting them to make a large scale community organizing a reality.  </p> <p>This is the 7th year of Live on Washington, but the 14th year the Neutral Zone teens have curated a large-scale concert.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>

Live on Washington, celebrating its 7th year, at the Neutral Zone teen center in Ann Arbor supports 45 high schoolers to meet Sept-June to plan this massive celebration of young artists.
This year's event is happening on Saturday, June 8th, from 3-11 p.m. on Washington Street in front of Neutral Zone.
Live on Washington teens curate this free and open to the public arts and music festival.  Two stages will feature 24 different teen performing groups ranging from poets to dance groups, jazz bands to rock bands, rappers, DJs and more. Teens learn to recruit, book and host touring headliners. The guest headliners this year are TV Girl (Los Angeles) and Kayo Genesis (NYC).    We need your help to pay for the stage, the lighting, the sound equipment and the licenses that are all necessary for this unique festival.  So far teens have met with corporate donors, organized fundraiser concerts, hosted a thrift store fundraiser, solicited donations from local businesses and planned a gala event for May 11th. Our total budget for the festival is $50,000 and we have already raised about $36,000 - this campaign is part of our plan to get us the rest of the way there!   
 
 
 

What We Need & What You Get
We will need a total of about $50,000 to fund the stage, sound, street permits, staffing, and to help us present headlining artists.  We have already raised about $36,000 towards our goal. This campaign’s goal of $4,000, will help us raise the rest of the funds we need.
 
We have some hard costs for
-staging, audio/visual support for our street party
-blocking off the street 
-renting tents and logistical production pieces
-artist payments to our headliners 
-marketing efforts
-staff time supporting through the year and day of
We are doing this as cheaply and professionally as we can!  Our team of youth curators is a volunteer, self selecting group of young people participating in the program.  We also use volunteer time day of the festival - get in contact with liveonwashington@gmail.com if you'd like to be involved! 
You will get the satisfaction of knowing you are helping to empower local teens; giving them leadership skills and experience, and supporting them in to have their voices heard in our community.  Last year over 80 youth performed in 24 different groups for 2,000 people in our audiences.
Check out the giving options for cool prizes and incentives.
 
 

The Impact
Young musicians NEED to have spaces to perform art that are safe, sober, and inclusive.  Live On Washington aims to be a radically inclusive festival, presenting for and of a broad cross section of the community.   Performers and presenters gain real world experiences that help 
Teen team members learn practices of curating and production they will take into their lives to be catalysts of their communities. They learn to design programing, build community partnerships, book and market artists, and to do production day of the event. We are aim to support the community changers of tomorrow by supporting them to make a large scale community organizing a reality.   This is the 7th year of Live on Washington, but the 14th year the Neutral Zone teens have curated a large-scale concert.
 
 

Risks & Challenges
We are operating industry standard ways of working on festivals, while our team is mostly made of people who are new to thinking through these challenges.  Our team is highly organized, into 5 sub committees of focus: Artist Relations, Community Partnerships, Fundraising, Media and Merchandise, and Promotion.  We coordinate all our work and meticulously take notes in google drive to keep ourselves on track. 
We balance both being a learning space, and operating with industry and community partners in professional ways. 
With your support we will be able to show up to create the best platform to support the young artists that have applied and been selected to perform, and the curators learning how to present our festival.

<p>My name is David Capaldi. My father is Antonio Capaldi, and he is the President of Le Nuove Contrade in Cassino, Italy. He lived in the UK for many years but was born in Cassino, and was a young boy when the Second World War swept through the valley, bringing with it many hardships and horrors.</p>
<p>The story of Wojtek the Soldier Bear resonates very deeply for my father as it takes place during the war, and the bear brought joy to the soldiers and locals who encountered him in Cassino.</p>
<p>The retaking of Monte Cassino Monastery from the Germans was accomplished by the Polish 2nd Corps 3rd Carpathian Rifle Division, and they received incredibly high numbers of casualties. A war cemetery for the Polish fallen stands behind the Monastery today.</p>
<p>This is why this campaign was started - to achieve the funding needed to have a statue built in Cassino remembering Wojtek and the brave Polish soldiers who gave their lives.</p>
<p>We are trying to raise the sum of €50,000 to have a statue cast in bronze. It will feature Wojtek and a Polish soldier named Emil Czech playing the bugle behind him. Emil was a member of the 2nd Corps and played the victory call when the monastery was taken. There will also be crossed flags of Italy and Poland.  The statue has been designed to reflect the strong ties between Cassino and Poland. Wojtek also has ties to the people of Scotland, as he went to Edinburgh Zoo after the war. There is even a Scottish band named after him!</p>
<p>If we don't reach the full amount of €50,000 there is provision for a smaller statue to be made out of marble, but we hope to be able to honour Wojtek's  and the Polish Soldier's memory with a display suitable for the many tourists and war history buffs who pass through the city.</p>
<p>Le Nuove Contrade is a non-profit organisation, and we don't have any perks or items to give you for your contribution. But anything you can donate to this cause will be very gratefully received, as you will be helping us with a cause dear to the hearts of people from many places. If you are unable to donate, you can still help us by spreading the word about this campaign via social media.</p>

<h3>Let's read some books together.</h3>
<p>We believe that churches embedded in walkable neighborhoods have unique opportunities to do ministry in creative ways. We started The Embedded Church Podcast as an outlet for sharing the dynamic stories of churches harnessing opportunities in their local, walkable context to reach their neighborhoods for the common good. </p>
<p>We believe this work of churches is increasingly vital as we see two cultural shifts happening in our cities: 1) people are moving back to the city, looking for walkable, connected communities; 2) people are lonelier than ever. The church has a crucial role to play in connecting people to a place and to one another. Jeremiah 29:7 calls us to ""seek the welfare of the city where I have sent you into exile, and pray to the Lord on its behalf, for in its welfare you will find your welfare.""</p>
<h3>We want to grow the vision.</h3>
<p>With Seasons 1 &amp; 2 under our belt, we want to continue educating and inspiring our listeners to actively engage their neighbors and grow the vision of their churches to redeem neighborhoods in order to promote human flourishing. To that end, Season 3 will be a series of focused book ""review"" discussions between Eric and Sara Joy. We will discuss six books that we believe are essential for understanding the connections between neighborhood design and the welfare of people and places. In particular, we will share how our faith informs our reading of these books and make valuable connections between our biblical callings and the stewardship of the places we inhabit.</p>
<p>We are so thankful for the support and encouragement we've received from our listeners. We fully believe this podcast has the capacity to grow and encourage, resource, and ignite church leaders across our country to take active and creative steps to fight against the loneliness permeating the lives of so many people in our neighborhoods and congregations. We hope to see congregations across America become catalyzers of belonging and purpose within the neighborhoods where they meet, fostering a deep community that promotes the welfare of our churches and our cities. </p>
<h3>Will you join with us in this good work?</h3>
<p>We need your help to make that happen! As we wait to hear back about grant funding, we are wanting to keep this important conversation going. Our budget is small. We have some funds left over from Season 2 and only need to raise about $600 more. Currently, neither Eric nor Sara Joy are compensated for their time. We are simply asking for your financial support to cover costs of audio editing and website maintenance to help us take on Season 3 (targeted for Fall 2020).</p>
<p>You can also support us in these ways -- Encourage your family and friends to listen! Share a link to the podcast on your social media! Write a review on iTunes!

<h3>The Center For Sex Positive Culture Has A Vision- Of Sexual Freedom For Everyone.</h3>
<p>Founded in 1999, The Center For Sex Positive Culture (""The CSPC"" or ""The Center"") is a 501(c)7 community center that serves as a sex-positive safe space for sexuality, intimacy, and relationship focused groups. Hosting events from workshops and skill-shares, socials and support groups, to gatherings where partners can be intimate with each other, The CSPC creates a sex-positive safe space for myriad of diverse communities.</p>
<p>The CSPC is also home to the Pacific Northwest Library for Sex Positive Culture- a unique archive of over 15,000 books, periodicals, and recorded media on sexuality, relationships, and erotic art, as well as the offices of The Foundation For Sex Positive Culture and The Consent Academy.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why Indiegogo?</h3>
<p>At the end of last year, The CSPC lost our long-time home when the building was sold by the property owners to developers. We have found a new building but before we can move in, a number of renovations need to be made. With the change of use from a warehouse (S2) to assembly (A3), we need to bring the building up to current fire, energy, seismic codes, and ADA accessibility compliance, in order to re-open our doors.</p>
<p>The CSPC has raised $20K in dedicated funds and begun construction. While The CPSC is prepared to use its reserves of $175k to cover rent and administrative costs during the build-out, your contribution ensures that we finish the project without depleting our savings entirely.</p>
<h3><strong>What Does All Of This Cost?</strong></h3>
<p>Thanks to the generous in-kind donations of skilled labor we are looking at an estimated $220-250K to complete all the build-out and updates required. The build-out looks something like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fire Code Updates: $57K</li>
<li>Construction (including ADA compliance and seismic retrofitting): $52K</li>
<li>Build-Out Supplies &amp; Overhead: $36K</li>
<li>Licensed Architects &amp; Engineers: $25K</li>
<li>Electrical &amp; Lighting Updates: $20K</li>
<li>Permitting &amp; Licenses: $15K</li>
<li>Furnishings: $15K</li>
<li>Energy Code Updates: $10K</li>
<li>Plumbing Updates (including on-demand water heaters and laundry): $3,500</li>
</ul>

</div><div>
<h3><strong>What This Means For Our New Home</strong></h3>
<p>Our new home is located on Block 69, in the Ballard neighbourhood of Seattle- two miles north of our previous location, with easy access to bus lines, ample parking, and just a few blocks from restaurants and shopping. The new building provides us 15% more usable square footage and allows us to craft the space for the unique needs of our community.</p>
<p>Once renovations are complete our new home will be fully ADA compliant and accessible, so everyone regardless of ability, can feel welcome in the space. While these changes add a layer of complexity to the design, we feel strongly that this is money well spent.</p>
<p>The space is also being designed for maximum versatility. While it is expensive to build for a myriad of uses up front, it will save money in the long run by not having to undo work or making additions later. This includes a more usable layout for the Pacific Northwest Library for Sex Positive Culture, whose collection has grown exponentially, and dedicated meeting space within the library for discussion groups and study.</p>
<p>Improved spaces for The Foundation For Sex Positive Culture (a 501(c)3 partner organization) and The Consent Academy, both housed within The CSPC, will allow for increased educational programming and community support groups. The FSPC and Consent Academy provide invaluable education and outreach both within The CSPC facilities and the community at large.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Roadblocks</h3>
<p>Our goal is to open the doors to our new home during summer 2017. As with any building project, there are potential outcomes which could delay our opening:</p>
<ul>
<li>Delays in the permitting process: Seattle is a hot market and the city permitting/inspection staff is overwhelmed with requests for building permits. Consequently the turnaround times could run longer than anticipated.</li>
<li>Volunteer availability: We’re relying on a proven history of in-kind donations of skilled labor and the hard work of our member volunteers to lower the overall build-out costs. Our members are busy people, often with competing priorities, so some projects may take longer to complete.</li>
<li><p>Building upgrades: Our new building was originally built as a warehouse. The use of the space as a community center required updating the premises for public use. While estimates can be made for anticipated upgrade costs, whenever upgrading or converting a property, unseen factors and their associated expenses can arise.</p></li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What Happens If We Reach Our Goal Early?</h3>
<p>In the event we reach our goal before the end of March, we'll be able to expand the scope of our build-out beyond just opening our doors but to include creature comforts such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>A/V upgrades</li>
<li>Staging/staff kitchen facilities</li>
<li>Custom furniture and textiles</li>
<li>Play-specific shower/wet room</li>
</ul>
<p>and much more! We'll also be able to add additional perks such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Extra ""Sexual Freedom For Everyone"" stickers for all perk levels</li>
<li>""Sexual Freedom For Everyone"" enamel pins</li>
<li>Limited-edition art prints</li>
<li>Additional surprises!</li>
</ul>

<p>*<strong>WORKSHOP DESCRIPTIONS</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Cigar Play -</strong> Smoke burns your eyes, you feel the hot ember nearing your skin, and you shudder at what might come next. You're sitting at your Top's feet, when they indicate a nice plump cigar ash on their boot… just for you. People walk by and wonder if your hair is on fire (even though you know it's not).</p>
<p>Cigar play is slow and erotic, delightfully varied, from fear play to ritual branding, sensation play to beautiful sexy smokey images to actually singing hair off your bottom... even eating ash.</p>
<p>Nothing brings together so many possible elements: from high protocol to primal energy, power exchange to sensation play; so many choices await the cigar player. Come to this class to learn about the many forms of cigar play available to us, and see how they can be used as anything from casual play to intense scenes.</p>
<p>This class is great for the curious or the novice, as we will cover some Cigar basics including choosing, handling, and smoking. Each attendee will be supplied with a cigar.</p>
<p><strong>Boots and Feet: Kicking, Trampling, and Stomping</strong> - Boots are sexy; they're heavy and strong, and the imagery of power that they evoke runs from the force of kicking to the mental aspect of being on the ground looking up. Whether the feet are clad in combat boots, lineman's boots, high heels, or even bare, force and fetish meet up powerfully in our feet.<br/><br/>Come learn more about kicking (how, where, techniques and warnings), as well as stomping, trampling, and even a little about breathing restriction. We'll also explore the headspace of bottoming to boots, from worship to fear and intimidation.</p>
<p><strong>Rough Rope</strong> - Bondage can be mean, but let’s make it meaner! We’ll take a little time looking at some common ties and new approaches to making them meaner, both in approach, attitude, and techniques. Beyond the tie, let's remember that there are lots of things to do with rope - lots of awful, mean, wonderful things - that have nothing to do with bondage, and we'll explore some of them. Floggers, whips, cudgels, gags, and a quick run-through of the patented (not really) Roughinamorato Ropefist.<br/><br/>Bring your rope (attendees should bring rope if they would like to practice or follow along). If you already know how to tie a chest harness that's great, but if you don't know what a chest harness, that's fine too - you'll still learn some good (terrible) stuff.</p>
<h3>Fulfilment &amp; Shipping</h3>
<p>""Sexual Freedom For Everyone"" perks will go into production at the close of the campaign. We anticipate beginning to ship perks within a month's time. Hanky perks may take two months to complete production, due to the hand-printed nature of these items.</p>
<p>Shipping fees, where applicable, will be collected along with your pledge. For sticker and/or thank you note perks shipping is $2 worldwide. All other shipped perks are $6 within the USA and $25 for the rest of the world. Shipping includes tracking and insurance.</p>

We thank you greatly for your support. Our campaign here on indiegogo has come to an end but we continue to raise funds through direct donations (as we have another 2 weeks to get enough money for cinema stars).

Free space is essential as it gives room to<strong> </strong>self-expression, to developing oneself and to meeting other people. Such spaces are absent in Nabatieh. There is no cultural space for youth to come together and enjoy a film screening or a theatre play, participate in a workshop or just meet each other. In a country like Lebanon, that has experienced civil war and is dealing with the conflict in neighbouring Syria, these spaces are extra important as they give youth and communities the place to independently connect with each other and envision an alternative future without war, conflict and hatred.</p><p>In 2016, the team of Tiro Association for Arts volunteered to renovate and reopen Cinema Stars, an old and iconic theatre in Nabatieh. This cinema, in the south of Lebanon, was established in 1972, and was closed due to the hardships of the Lebanese civil war in 1989. Since its reopening in 2016, the association was able<strong> </strong>to use the space and organise many different cultural activities for the residents of Nabatieh and the surrounding areas. Currently, our precious cinema is threatened to be closed. The theater has been put up for sale and we fear it'll be lost as a free space for culture and arts.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1502201704/hdriq8jckytgnsfouf7a.png"" src=""""/></p><p><strong>With this campaign we aim to buy Cinema Stars.

We are Albatros, a start-up organization that aims to provide language courses and cultural activities to people in Tlatlauquitepec (Puebla), Mexico.</p><p>Where was born the idea? First of all, let me introduce myself! I am Flora, 22 and French. Various reasons have motivated me to launch such a project… I was born in a country where education is for everyone. It allowed me to complete a brilliant education in Languages and International &amp; Commercial Relations and to travel around the world. I lived 1 year and a half in Mexico (Puebla) in the framework of my Bachelor’s degree and I lived 6 months in Cambodia (Phnom Penh) in the framework of my Master’s degree.</p><p>These experiences brought me a lot, whether it is on professional aspects or more personal ones. I discovered different cultures, different languages, different ways of thinking and living. I met incredibly nice people, people who had nothing and people who had it all. I had the opportunity to carry out professional experiences and voluntary works. During these experiences I have been changing a lot. I realized how lucky I was to be born in my country and all the advantages it brought me.</p><p>And there came the end of my studies. What was I going to do? I definitely didn’t want to work in a corporate firm with all the life it would bring. This was just not made for me. So I decided to think about what I could do, what I loved, and what I wanted to spend my life working in. My experience in Mexico and Cambodia broadly influenced my choice. I always wanted to work into something that would beneficiate to the others, but also doing something that I would love. Living in Mexico helped me to found the idea through various experiences I had as a French teacher in underprivileged schools. Then, Cambodia helped me to concretize it by realizing that it was possible and that I needed to give it a try. I met so many young people starting their projects that it began to become possible in my mind. There was born Albatros, which is currently my most important project and the one I want to concentrate my professional life into and make it successful.</p><h3><strong>WHY TLATLAUQUITEPEC, PUEBLA?</strong></h3><p>During my time in Mexico, I met Aldo who had a huge impact in my life. Aldo was working in Tlatlauquitepec, so I discovered this village that I immediately loved.</p><p>Tlatlauquitepec is a little village located in the Sierra Norte of Puebla state.</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1505667971/wjnbuwxdxnjxqqtczyfo.png"" src=""""/></p><p>We drove various actions in the village such as cultural awareness and French teaching. We discovered that education is not the main priority there and that the need of cultural, ethical and critical awareness was huge.  </p><p>Our main goals are to spread education, culture and opportunities and make them accessible for everyone. Today, too many people don’t have access to these basic needs and we want to change this. It is a priority for us and a topic we really care about.</p><p>Our goal is to make it possible for everybody, independently from the price or economical means, this is why we are planning to settle prices as low as possible.</p><p>We are planning to throw out our project in the next few months, this is why we are now launching this crowdfunding campaign.</p><h3> </h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1505662272/tgde6bsw1u9vgeidrymi.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><h3><strong>Mission &amp; Vision</strong></h3><p><i>MISSION</i><br/>We are willing to implement a language school providing English and French classes, accessible to all, to open a place where education and educative growth opportunities are available to everyone.<br/>We want to implement cultural activities and events, to culturally wake up the village and give the opportunity to all to express their passions and talents:</p><ul>

</ul><p><strong>TOTAL = 2000€</strong></p><h3>The Impact Of Our Campaign - Why Your Support Is Important</h3><p>On many points, education is vital - it allows to think by yourself, to achieve projects and dreams, to have a better life. Sadly, many people don’t have access to education although it is a basic need and a fundamental right.</p><p>Discovering the world and its cultures is in many ways essential. When we get to know other people and their differences, we accept them easier. On the contrary, it is when we don’t know the differences that we don’t understand them, that we are afraid of them and where is created a barrier that can lead to many problems.</p><p>For example, in Mexico, racism and classism are sadly powerful and this is something that must be changed. Indigenous populations are treated in a bad way, which is the result of ignorance and lack of education. We want to change this and to make mentalities evolve.</p><p>We also want to give more opportunities to more people to develop themselves as persons and education is a path that should be taken by everyone.</p><p>We had the opportunity to access education, now it is our turn to give the others this opportunity. Together we are powerful!</p><p>Your donation will go directly towards the development of the school and cultural center. We will keep you posted on the advancements!</p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p>What we like about the idea of being crowdfunded is that everyone can be an actor of change. If you can’t contribute too much financially, it is fine! We are very OK with little amounts of money. Imagine if everyone gives 1€, we would reach our goal and this project would be able to begin. Together, we are powerful! We would like people to be conscious of the challenge and to be generous with a little amount of money to help us create this beautiful project that will beneficiate to many people.</p><p>The other ways you can help are numerous: SPREAD THE WORD!</p><p>Pass the project around, post it and share it on social media, talk about it to as many people as possible, get people excited to make this project reality!</p><p>SHARE THE CAMPAIGN LINK:</p><ul>

Soy Flora, 22 años y francesa. Varias razones me motivaron a lanzar tal proyecto... Nací en un país donde la educación es para todos. Me permitió completar una brillante educación en Lenguas y Relaciones Internacionales y viajar por el mundo. Viví un año y medio en México (Puebla) para mi licenciatura y 6 meses en Camboya (Phnom Penh) en el marco de mi maestría.</p><p>Estas experiencias me aportaron mucho, ya sea en aspectos profesionales o más personales.

Decidí pensar en lo que podía hacer, en lo que amaba y en lo que quería hacer de mi vida. Mis experiencias en México y Camboya influyeron ampliamente mi elección. Siempre quise trabajar en un sector que beneficiaría a los demás, pero también haciendo algo que me encantaría. Vivir en México me ayudó a encontrar la idea a través de varias experiencias que tuve como maestra de francés en escuelas desfavorecidas. Entonces, Camboya me ayudó a concretizarla; me di cuenta de que era posible y que necesitaba intentarlo. Conocí a tantos jóvenes que comenzaron sus proyectos que éste empezó a volverse posible en mi mente y decidí darle una oportunidad. Asi nació Albatros, que actualmente es mi proyecto más importante y en el que deseo concentrar mi vida profesional y dedicarme.</p><h3>¿POR QUÉ TLATLAUQUITEPEC, PUEBLA?</h3><p>Durante mi estancia en México, conocí a Aldo que tuvo un gran impacto en mi vida.

Lamentablemente, muchas personas no tienen acceso a la educación, aunque es una necesidad básica y un derecho fundamental.</p><p>Descubrir el mundo y sus culturas es en muchos aspectos algo esencial.

Por el contrario, es cuando no conocemos las diferencias que no las comprendemos, que nos asustamos y donde se crea una barrera que puede conducir a muchos problemas.</p><p>Por ejemplo, en México el racismo y el clasismo son tristemente poderosos y esto es algo que debe cambiar. Las poblaciones indígenas son maltratadas. Este es el resultado de la ignorancia y la falta de educación. Queremos cambiar esto y hacer evolucionar las mentalidades.</p><p>También queremos dar más oportunidades a más personas para desarrollarse y la educación es un camino que debe ser tomado por todos.</p><p>Tuvimos la oportunidad de acceder a la educación, ahora es nuestro turno de dar a los demás esta oportunidad. ¡Todos somos buenos pero no tan buenos como todos juntos!</p><p>Su donación se destinará directamente al desarrollo de la escuela y el centro cultural. ¡Los mantendremos informados sobre los avances!</p><h3>Puedes ayudar de otras formas</h3><p>Lo que nos gusta de la idea del financiamiento participativo es que todos pueden ser un actor de cambio. Si no puede contribuir economicamente, ¡está bien! Estamos muy bien con pequeñas cantidades de dinero. Imagínense si cada uno da 1 €, alcanzaríamos nuestra meta y este proyecto podría comenzar. ¡Juntos, somos poderosos! Queremos que la gente sea consciente del desafío y sea generosa con una pequeña cantidad de dinero para ayudarnos a crear este hermoso proyecto que beneficiará a muchas personas.</p><p>Las otras maneras en que pueden ayudar son numerosas: ¡DIFUNDIR LA PALABRA!</p><p>Difundan el proyecto, publiquenlo y compartanlo en las redes sociales, hablen al numero mas grande de personas, ¡animen a la gente en hacer realidad este proyecto!</p><p>COMPARTIR EL ENLACE DE LA CAMPAÑA:</p><ul>

Nous sommes Albatros, une entreprise sociale qui vise à offrir des cours de langues et des activités culturelles aux habitants de Tlatlauquitepec, au Mexique.</p><p>Comment est né ce projet ? Tout d'abord, permettez-moi de me présenter ! Je m'appelle Flora, j'ai 22 ans et je suis française. Diverses raisons m'ont motivée à lancer un tel projet... Je suis née dans un pays où l'éducation est accessible à tous. Cela m'a permis de réaliser des études en Langues et Relations Internationales et de voyager à travers le monde. J'ai vécu 1 an et demi au Mexique (Puebla) dans le cadre de ma licence et 6 mois au Cambodge (Phnom Penh) dans le cadre de mon master.</p><p>Ces expériences m'ont beaucoup apporté, que ce soit  professionnellement ou à titre plus personnel. J'ai découvert différentes cultures, différentes langues, différentes façons de penser et de vivre. J'ai notamment eu l'opportunité de mener des expériences professionnelles et des actions bénévoles. Au cours de ces expériences, mon état d’esprit et ma mentalité ont beaucoup évolué. Je me suis rendu compte de la chance d’être née dans mon pays et de tous ses avantages.</p><p>Et voilà que la fin de mes études arrive. Que vais-je faire ? J'ai donc réfléchi à ce qui s'offrait à moi, à ce que j'aime, et comment je souhaite vivre. Mes expériences au Mexique et au Cambodge ont largement influencé mon choix. J'ai toujours voulu travailler dans un domaine qui bénéficierait aux autres tout en faisant ce que j'aime. Vivre au Mexique m'a aidé à trouver l'idée grâce à diverses expériences que j'ai eu en tant que professeur de français dans des écoles défavorisées. Le Cambodge m'a aidé à concrétiser cette idée en me faisant prendre conscience que cela était possible et qu'il fallait essayer. J'ai rencontré tant de jeunes qui débutent leurs projets que ce projet à commencé à devenir réalisable dans mon esprit ; j'ai alors décidé de me lancer. Est donc né Albatros, qui est actuellement pour moi,  le projet le plus important, et pour lequel je mettrai tous les moyens en oeuvre permettant sa réussite.</p><h3>POURQUOI TLATLAUQUITEPEC, PUEBLA?</h3><p>Pendant mon séjour au Mexique, j'ai rencontré Aldo qui a eu un impact considérable dans ma vie. Aldo travaille à Tlatlauquitepec, j'ai donc pu découvrir ce village pour lequel j'ai eu un coup de coeur.</p><p>Tlatlauquitepec est un petit village situé dans la Sierra Norte de l'Etat de Puebla.</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1505667971/wjnbuwxdxnjxqqtczyfo.png"" src=""""/></p><p>Nous avons conduit diverses actions dans le village, telles que de la sensibilisation culturelle et l'enseignement du français. Nous avons découvert que l'éducation n'est pas la principale priorité là-bas et que les besoins de sensibilisation culturelle, éthique et critique sont primordiales.</p><p>Nos principaux objectifs sont de diffuser l'éducation, la culture et de provoquer des opportunités et les rendre accessibles à tous.

Lorsque nous connaissons les autres et leurs différences, nous les acceptons plus facilement. Au contraire, c'est lorsque nous ne connaissons pas les différences que nous ne les comprenons pas, que nous les craignons. </p><p>Par exemple, au Mexique, le racisme et le classicisme sont tristement puissants et ceci doit changer. Les populations autochtones sont plutôt mal traitées, malheureusement résultat de l'ignorance et du manque d'éducation. Nous voulons changer cela et faire évoluer les mentalités.</p><p>Nous voulons également donner plus de possibilités à une majorité de personnes de se développer personnellement ; l'éducation est un chemin qui doit être pris par tout le monde.</p><p>Nous avons eu accès à l'éducation, désormais,  nous nous devons de la transmettre à d'autres. Ensemble, nous pouvons réaliser beaucoup !</p><p>Votre don sera directement dirigé vers le développement de l'école et auprès du centre culturel. Nous ne manquerons pas de vous informer des avancées de notre projet !</p><h3>D'autre façons d’aider</h3><p>Le financement participatif permet à chacun d'être un acteur de changement.

We are Albatros, a start-up organization that aims to provide language courses and cultural activities to people in Tlatlauquitepec (Puebla), Mexico.Where was born the idea? First of all, let me introduce myself! I am Flora, 22 and French. Various reasons have motivated me to launch such a project… I was born in a country where education is for everyone. It allowed me to complete a brilliant education in Languages and International & Commercial Relations and to travel around the world. I lived 1 year and a half in Mexico (Puebla) in the framework of my Bachelor’s degree and I lived 6 months in Cambodia (Phnom Penh) in the framework of my Master’s degree.These experiences brought me a lot, whether it is on professional aspects or more personal ones. I discovered different cultures, different languages, different ways of thinking and living. I met incredibly nice people, people who had nothing and people who had it all. I had the opportunity to carry out professional experiences and voluntary works. During these experiences I have been changing a lot. I realized how lucky I was to be born in my country and all the advantages it brought me.And there came the end of my studies. What was I going to do? I definitely didn’t want to work in a corporate firm with all the life it would bring. This was just not made for me. So I decided to think about what I could do, what I loved, and what I wanted to spend my life working in. My experience in Mexico and Cambodia broadly influenced my choice. I always wanted to work into something that would beneficiate to the others, but also doing something that I would love. Living in Mexico helped me to found the idea through various experiences I had as a French teacher in underprivileged schools. Then, Cambodia helped me to concretize it by realizing that it was possible and that I needed to give it a try. I met so many young people starting their projects that it began to become possible in my mind. There was born Albatros, which is currently my most important project and the one I want to concentrate my professional life into and make it successful.WHY TLATLAUQUITEPEC, PUEBLA?During my time in Mexico, I met Aldo who had a huge impact in my life. Aldo was working in Tlatlauquitepec, so I discovered this village that I immediately loved.Tlatlauquitepec is a little village located in the Sierra Norte of Puebla state. We drove various actions in the village such as cultural awareness and French teaching. We discovered that education is not the main priority there and that the need of cultural, ethical and critical awareness was huge.  Our main goals are to spread education, culture and opportunities and make them accessible for everyone. Today, too many people don’t have access to these basic needs and we want to change this. It is a priority for us and a topic we really care about.Our goal is to make it possible for everybody, independently from the price or economical means, this is why we are planning to settle prices as low as possible.We are planning to throw out our project in the next few months, this is why we are now launching this crowdfunding campaign.  Mission & VisionMISSIONWe are willing to implement a language school providing English and French classes, accessible to all, to open a place where education and educative growth opportunities are available to everyone.We want to implement cultural activities and events, to culturally wake up the village and give the opportunity to all to express their passions and talents:

TOTAL = 2000€The Impact Of Our Campaign - Why Your Support Is ImportantOn many points, education is vital - it allows to think by yourself, to achieve projects and dreams, to have a better life. Sadly, many people don’t have access to education although it is a basic need and a fundamental right.Discovering the world and its cultures is in many ways essential. When we get to know other people and their differences, we accept them easier. On the contrary, it is when we don’t know the differences that we don’t understand them, that we are afraid of them and where is created a barrier that can lead to many problems.For example, in Mexico, racism and classism are sadly powerful and this is something that must be changed. Indigenous populations are treated in a bad way, which is the result of ignorance and lack of education. We want to change this and to make mentalities evolve.We also want to give more opportunities to more people to develop themselves as persons and education is a path that should be taken by everyone.We had the opportunity to access education, now it is our turn to give the others this opportunity. Together we are powerful!Your donation will go directly towards the development of the school and cultural center. We will keep you posted on the advancements!Other Ways You Can HelpWhat we like about the idea of being crowdfunded is that everyone can be an actor of change. If you can’t contribute too much financially, it is fine! We are very OK with little amounts of money. Imagine if everyone gives 1€, we would reach our goal and this project would be able to begin. Together, we are powerful! We would like people to be conscious of the challenge and to be generous with a little amount of money to help us create this beautiful project that will beneficiate to many people.The other ways you can help are numerous: SPREAD THE WORD!Pass the project around, post it and share it on social media, talk about it to as many people as possible, get people excited to make this project reality!SHARE THE CAMPAIGN LINK:

_____________________________________________________________________________________ESPAÑOL:COMPARTE, EXPLORA, RIE ... Y APRENDE!LA EDUCACIÓN, UNA PRIORIDAD@AlbatrosTlatlauquiLa educación es el arma más poderosa que puedes usar para cambiar el mundo - Nelson Mandela  Resumen - Nuestro proyecto¡Hola a todos y gracias por leernos! Somos Albatros, un negocio social que tiene como objetivo ofrecer cursos de idiomas y actividades culturales en Tlatlauquitepec, México.¿Dónde nació la idea? ¡En primer lugar permítame presentarme! Soy Flora, 22 años y francesa. Varias razones me motivaron a lanzar tal proyecto... Nací en un país donde la educación es para todos. Me permitió completar una brillante educación en Lenguas y Relaciones Internacionales y viajar por el mundo. Viví un año y medio en México (Puebla) para mi licenciatura y 6 meses en Camboya (Phnom Penh) en el marco de mi maestría.Estas experiencias me aportaron mucho, ya sea en aspectos profesionales o más personales. Descubrí diferentes culturas, diferentes lenguajes, diferentes maneras de pensar y vivir. Tuve la oportunidad de realizar experiencias profesionales y voluntariados. Durante estas experiencias he estado cambiando mucho mi mentalidad y forma de pensar. Me di cuenta de lo afortunada que era de haber nacido en mi país y de todas las ventajas que me había dado.Llegó el final de mis estudios. ¿Qué iba a hacer? Decidí pensar en lo que podía hacer, en lo que amaba y en lo que quería hacer de mi vida. Mis experiencias en México y Camboya influyeron ampliamente mi elección. Siempre quise trabajar en un sector que beneficiaría a los demás, pero también haciendo algo que me encantaría. Vivir en México me ayudó a encontrar la idea a través de varias experiencias que tuve como maestra de francés en escuelas desfavorecidas. Entonces, Camboya me ayudó a concretizarla; me di cuenta de que era posible y que necesitaba intentarlo. Conocí a tantos jóvenes que comenzaron sus proyectos que éste empezó a volverse posible en mi mente y decidí darle una oportunidad. Asi nació Albatros, que actualmente es mi proyecto más importante y en el que deseo concentrar mi vida profesional y dedicarme.¿POR QUÉ TLATLAUQUITEPEC, PUEBLA?Durante mi estancia en México, conocí a Aldo que tuvo un gran impacto en mi vida. Aldo estaba trabajando en Tlatlauquitepec y así descubrí este pueblo que inmediatamente amé.Tlatlauquitepec es un pequeño pueblo ubicado en la Sierra Norte del estado de Puebla.Ya dirigimos varias acciones en el pueblo como la conciencia cultural y la enseñanza del francés. Descubrimos que la educación no era la principal prioridad ahí y que la necesidad de conciencia cultural, ética y crítica era una prioridad.Nuestros principales objetivos son difundir la educación, la cultura y las oportunidades y hacerlas accesibles para todos. Hoy en día, demasiada gente no tiene acceso a estas necesidades básicas y queremos cambiar esto. Es una importancia capital para nosotros y algo que realmente nos importa.Nuestro objetivo es hacer posible que todos, independientemente del precio o los medios económicos tengan acceso a la educacion. Esta es la razón por la cual estamos planeando para establecer precios tan bajos como sea posible.Misión y visiónMISIÓNImplementar una escuela de idiomas que ofrezca clases de inglés y francés, accesible a todos.

TOTAL = 2000 €El impacto de nuestra campaña - ¿Por qué es importante su apoyo?En muchos puntos, la educación es vital - permite pensar por sí mismo, para lograr proyectos y sueños, para tener una vida mejor. Lamentablemente, muchas personas no tienen acceso a la educación, aunque es una necesidad básica y un derecho fundamental.Descubrir el mundo y sus culturas es en muchos aspectos algo esencial. Cuando conocemos a los demás y sus diferencias, los aceptamos más fácilmente. Por el contrario, es cuando no conocemos las diferencias que no las comprendemos, que nos asustamos y donde se crea una barrera que puede conducir a muchos problemas.Por ejemplo, en México el racismo y el clasismo son tristemente poderosos y esto es algo que debe cambiar. Las poblaciones indígenas son maltratadas. Este es el resultado de la ignorancia y la falta de educación. Queremos cambiar esto y hacer evolucionar las mentalidades.También queremos dar más oportunidades a más personas para desarrollarse y la educación es un camino que debe ser tomado por todos.Tuvimos la oportunidad de acceder a la educación, ahora es nuestro turno de dar a los demás esta oportunidad. ¡Todos somos buenos pero no tan buenos como todos juntos!Su donación se destinará directamente al desarrollo de la escuela y el centro cultural. ¡Los mantendremos informados sobre los avances!Puedes ayudar de otras formasLo que nos gusta de la idea del financiamiento participativo es que todos pueden ser un actor de cambio. Si no puede contribuir economicamente, ¡está bien! Estamos muy bien con pequeñas cantidades de dinero. Imagínense si cada uno da 1 €, alcanzaríamos nuestra meta y este proyecto podría comenzar. ¡Juntos, somos poderosos! Queremos que la gente sea consciente del desafío y sea generosa con una pequeña cantidad de dinero para ayudarnos a crear este hermoso proyecto que beneficiará a muchas personas.Las otras maneras en que pueden ayudar son numerosas: ¡DIFUNDIR LA PALABRA!Difundan el proyecto, publiquenlo y compartanlo en las redes sociales, hablen al numero mas grande de personas, ¡animen a la gente en hacer realidad este proyecto!COMPARTIR EL ENLACE DE LA CAMPAÑA:

_____________________________________________________________________________________ FRANCAIS : PARTAGER, EXPLORER, RIRE ... ET APPRENDRE!L'ÉDUCATION, UNE PRIORITE@AlbatrosTlatlauquiL'éducation est l'arme la plus puissante que vous pouvez utiliser pour changer le monde -Nelson Mandela  Résumé - Notre projetBonjour à tous et merci de nous lire ! Nous sommes Albatros, une entreprise sociale qui vise à offrir des cours de langues et des activités culturelles aux habitants de Tlatlauquitepec, au Mexique.Comment est né ce projet ? Tout d'abord, permettez-moi de me présenter ! Je m'appelle Flora, j'ai 22 ans et je suis française. Diverses raisons m'ont motivée à lancer un tel projet... Je suis née dans un pays où l'éducation est accessible à tous. Cela m'a permis de réaliser des études en Langues et Relations Internationales et de voyager à travers le monde. J'ai vécu 1 an et demi au Mexique (Puebla) dans le cadre de ma licence et 6 mois au Cambodge (Phnom Penh) dans le cadre de mon master.Ces expériences m'ont beaucoup apporté, que ce soit  professionnellement ou à titre plus personnel. J'ai découvert différentes cultures, différentes langues, différentes façons de penser et de vivre. J'ai notamment eu l'opportunité de mener des expériences professionnelles et des actions bénévoles. Au cours de ces expériences, mon état d’esprit et ma mentalité ont beaucoup évolué. Je me suis rendu compte de la chance d’être née dans mon pays et de tous ses avantages.Et voilà que la fin de mes études arrive. Que vais-je faire ? J'ai donc réfléchi à ce qui s'offrait à moi, à ce que j'aime, et comment je souhaite vivre. Mes expériences au Mexique et au Cambodge ont largement influencé mon choix. J'ai toujours voulu travailler dans un domaine qui bénéficierait aux autres tout en faisant ce que j'aime. Vivre au Mexique m'a aidé à trouver l'idée grâce à diverses expériences que j'ai eu en tant que professeur de français dans des écoles défavorisées. Le Cambodge m'a aidé à concrétiser cette idée en me faisant prendre conscience que cela était possible et qu'il fallait essayer. J'ai rencontré tant de jeunes qui débutent leurs projets que ce projet à commencé à devenir réalisable dans mon esprit ; j'ai alors décidé de me lancer. Est donc né Albatros, qui est actuellement pour moi,  le projet le plus important, et pour lequel je mettrai tous les moyens en oeuvre permettant sa réussite.POURQUOI TLATLAUQUITEPEC, PUEBLA?Pendant mon séjour au Mexique, j'ai rencontré Aldo qui a eu un impact considérable dans ma vie. Aldo travaille à Tlatlauquitepec, j'ai donc pu découvrir ce village pour lequel j'ai eu un coup de coeur.Tlatlauquitepec est un petit village situé dans la Sierra Norte de l'Etat de Puebla. Nous avons conduit diverses actions dans le village, telles que de la sensibilisation culturelle et l'enseignement du français. Nous avons découvert que l'éducation n'est pas la principale priorité là-bas et que les besoins de sensibilisation culturelle, éthique et critique sont primordiales.Nos principaux objectifs sont de diffuser l'éducation, la culture et de provoquer des opportunités et les rendre accessibles à tous. Aujourd'hui, trop de personnes n'ont pas accès à ces besoins fondamentaux et nous voulons changer cela. C'est un enjeu capital pour nous et un sujet auquel nous nous intéressons vraiment.Notre objectif est de permettre à tout le monde, indépendamment des moyens financiers, d'accéder à nos services. C'est pourquoi nous avons décidé de mettre les tarifs aussi bas que possibles.Nous prévoyons de lancer notre projet au cours des prochains mois, c'est la raison pour laquelle nous organisons cette campagne de financement.  MISSION ET VISIONMISSIONMettre en place une école de langues proposant des cours d'anglais et de français, aider les élèves de primaire jusqu'au lycée avec l'aide aux devoirs. Rendre ces services accessibles à tous. Ouvrir un lieu où les possibilités d'éducation et de croissance éducative sont à la portée de tous.Mettre en place des activités et des événements culturels pour tous. Nous voulons réveiller le village et donner l'opportunité à tous d'exprimer passions et talents avec une approche ludique :
Documentaire / diffusion de films
Spectacles (théâtre, magie, animation, etc.)
Débats / conférences / discussions
idées, sujets, présentations thématiques
Expositions d'art
Concerts
Ventes d'occasion
Évènements sportifs
... nous accueillons toutes sortes d'idées !

TOTAL = 2000 €L'impact de notre campagne - Pourquoi votre soutien est importantSur plusieurs points, l'éducation est vitale : elle permet de penser par soi-même, de réaliser des projets et des rêves, d'obtenir une vie meilleure, car, malheureusement, beaucoup de personnes n'y ont pas accès. Découvrir le monde et ses cultures est à bien des égards un élément essentiel. Lorsque nous connaissons les autres et leurs différences, nous les acceptons plus facilement. Au contraire, c'est lorsque nous ne connaissons pas les différences que nous ne les comprenons pas, que nous les craignons. Par exemple, au Mexique, le racisme et le classicisme sont tristement puissants et ceci doit changer. Les populations autochtones sont plutôt mal traitées, malheureusement résultat de l'ignorance et du manque d'éducation. Nous voulons changer cela et faire évoluer les mentalités.Nous voulons également donner plus de possibilités à une majorité de personnes de se développer personnellement ; l'éducation est un chemin qui doit être pris par tout le monde.Nous avons eu accès à l'éducation, désormais,  nous nous devons de la transmettre à d'autres. Ensemble, nous pouvons réaliser beaucoup !Votre don sera directement dirigé vers le développement de l'école et auprès du centre culturel. Nous ne manquerons pas de vous informer des avancées de notre projet !D'autre façons d’aiderLe financement participatif permet à chacun d'être un acteur de changement.

<p>Kibera is an informal settlement in the heart of Kenya's capital Nairobi. Home to up to one million people living side by side in mud-walled shacks, Kibera is not the easiest place to grow up as a child. </p>
<p>There are two types of schools in Kibera: formal - which are recognized by the Ministry of Education, and non-formal. The formal schools in Kibera are few, and all of them are densely populated - sometimes there are 80 students per teacher in one classroom. The lack of public schools has locked many school-age children out of the formal system and has led to the mushrooming of private and informal schools in the settlement, which are often poorly resourced and provide sub-standard education. In these conditions, access to books and peaceful places to read can be particularly difficult.</p>
<p>In our video, Mary Akinyi, 18, takes us on a journey to show us why libraries are important in Kibera.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Who We Are</strong></h3>
<p>Art Kids Foundation is a small non-profit organization founded and registered in Kenya in 2015 by photojournalist Natalia Jidovanu to support children and youth in Kibera slum and other underprivileged urban and rural areas in Kenya to realize their full potential through education and arts. In January 2019, Art Kids has partnered with Kibera Stories to open and run a community library in the Soweto East neighborhood.</p>
<p>Kibera Stories is a successful documentary photography project started in 2013 by photojournalist Brian Otieno, who was born and raised in Kibera. Through Kibera Stories, Brian looks beyond the chaotic appearance of his hometown and provides a powerful testimony of life in Kibera from socio-economic, cultural, political and environmental perspectives.</p>
<p><a href=""http://kiberastories.storitellah.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://kiberastories.storitellah.com</a></p>
<p>Our new library - Young Minds - opened doors in February 2019 and is free of charge to all students and children in Kibera. The library provides a safe space for the youth to learn, grow, and develop their skills, their ideas and their identities.</p>
<p>The students are welcomed and supported by Mary Akinyi, a graduate from Art Kids Foundation's high school scholarship program, who helps to run the library from Tuesday to Sunday.</p>

Prieš metus pradėjau edukacinę kino platformą „Kitas Kinas“, kurioje rodomi ir apžvelgiami paribio filmai, istorijos ir asmenybės, susijusios su jais. Šios platformos tikslas yra iškelti į dienos šviesą nepelnytai užmirštus filmus, apžvelgti pačias įdomiausias šiuolaikinio nepriklausomo kino apraiškas ir šviesti žmones apie nepriklausomo kino istoriją. Tikiu, kad ši platforma suteikia puikią galimybę ugdyti ne tik gerą, bet ir blogą skonį. Mano organizuotos peržiūros buvo itin sėkmingos, todėl nusprendžiau sukurti šį tą didesnio. Būtent taip gimė MONDO BIZARRO idėja. Prie šio projekto prisijungė nedidelė kūrybingų žmonių komanda ir svajonė pamažu tampa realybe. Mes dirbame vedini savo aistros kinui, negaudami jokios finansinės paramos. Investuojame savo laiką ir pinigus norėdami sukurti nepakartojamą kino renginį visiems filmų entuziastams.

Mes taip pat pakvietėme pranešėjų, kurie savo paskaitomis suteiks itin reikalingo konteksto šiai užmirštai kino pusei. Visi filmai bus pristatomi kino kritikų, festivalio sudarinėtojų ir mūsų komandos narių. Tokiu būdu norime pabrėžti festivalio edukacinę misiją.

The goal of this platform is to rescue unwittingly abandoned films from obscurity and overview the most interesting manifestations of contemporary independent cinema as well as to educate people about the history of alternative cinema. I believe this give an important opportunity to develop not only good but also a bad taste. My organized screenings had great success so I decided to make something bigger. That is how idea for MONDO BIZARRO was born. Number of creative people joined this project and the dream is becoming reality. We are working out of passion for cinema without any financial support.

For a weekend, we can all let every part of ourselves shine in a place that is created to support and accept us. All of us. Queer or straight, PS or Xbox, Golden Age or manga—if you believe that love is love and games are for everyone, you are welcome here.<br/><br/>Gathering this community takes a village: <strong>a big, sparkly, flannel, furry, bathrooms-are-for-everyone village with really good wi-fi</strong>. A fleet of dedicated volunteers work hard year-round to bring this convention to life, and the funds raised here give them the tools they need to create this amazing experience. Every person has an impact, and every gift you can give to bring this community to life is valued and appreciated.<br/><br/><strong>We're here, we're queer, and we'll be in the expo hall with our bags of holding to gather amazing lootz!</strong></p><h2>What are people saying about HavenCon?</h2><p>""The atmosphere was amazing!

So much time is spent feeling like you have to hide some part of yourself from the social circles around you.But guess what? There's a Haven, and it's just for you. And you. And YOU.For the past three years, a rainbow community has gathered in Austin, TX to tell stories, play, listen, draw, read, roll dice, dress up, dance, share gaming tips, learn, blow kisses to kings and queens, hole up a bit to introvert, make mistakes, apologize and forgive, hug old friends, and make new ones. For a weekend, we can all let every part of ourselves shine in a place that is created to support and accept us. All of us. Queer or straight, PS or Xbox, Golden Age or manga—if you believe that love is love and games are for everyone, you are welcome here.Gathering this community takes a village: a big, sparkly, flannel, furry, bathrooms-are-for-everyone village with really good wi-fi. A fleet of dedicated volunteers work hard year-round to bring this convention to life, and the funds raised here give them the tools they need to create this amazing experience. Every person has an impact, and every gift you can give to bring this community to life is valued and appreciated.We're here, we're queer, and we'll be in the expo hall with our bags of holding to gather amazing lootz!What are people saying about HavenCon?""The atmosphere was amazing!

<p><strong>What is the Jazz Bicycle Tour?</strong></p>
<p>The Jazz Bicycle Tour aka JBT is the visionary placekeeping project co-directed by Tammy Gomez--avid bicyclist and founder of Sound Culture--and Laney Yarber--jazz aficionado and founder of Pedestrian Dance. We simply want to host a community bicycle ride through both the Historic Southside and downtown Fort Worth, stopping briefly at locations along the way that hold jazz history and lore.</p>
<p>The Jazz Bicycle Tour will kick off at the Ella Mae Shamblee Public Library, where a first-time exhibit of jazz drummer Ronald Shannon Jackson memorabilia--including concert posters, performance costumes, and instruments--will be unveiled.  Another highlight will be a live musical performance by music curator and jazz heritage musician Rachella Parks-Washington.</p>
<p>Many folks in our fair city will find out for the first time about the places where jazz legends like Ornette Coleman, Dewey Redman, and Ronald Shannon Jackson once studied, played, and resided.</p>
<p>With your support, this JAZZ BICYCLE TOUR (JBT) will be as enjoyable  and enlightening as we plan AND it can be offered FREE of charge to participants AND we can pay our jazz performers, graphic designer, videographer, and produce a few printed materials and goodies (stickers and pins) for giveaway and promotion.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Please support the JBT with your donation!</strong></p>

The Jazz Bicycle Tour aka JBT is the visionary placekeeping project co-directed by Tammy Gomez--avid bicyclist and founder of Sound Culture--and Laney Yarber--jazz aficionado and founder of Pedestrian Dance. We simply want to host a community bicycle ride through both the Historic Southside and downtown Fort Worth, stopping briefly at locations along the way that hold jazz history and lore.
The Jazz Bicycle Tour will kick off at the Ella Mae Shamblee Public Library, where a first-time exhibit of jazz drummer Ronald Shannon Jackson memorabilia--including concert posters, performance costumes, and instruments--will be unveiled.  Another highlight will be a live musical performance by music curator and jazz heritage musician Rachella Parks-Washington.
Many folks in our fair city will find out for the first time about the places where jazz legends like Ornette Coleman, Dewey Redman, and Ronald Shannon Jackson once studied, played, and resided.
With your support, this JAZZ BICYCLE TOUR (JBT) will be as enjoyable  and enlightening as we plan AND it can be offered FREE of charge to participants AND we can pay our jazz performers, graphic designer, videographer, and produce a few printed materials and goodies (stickers and pins) for giveaway and promotion.
 
Please support the JBT with your donation!

In Italy, Black lives are perpetually framed by a Eurocentric gaze. Such a gaze contributes to the erasure of the complexities and nuances that form the Black and POC communities.</p><p>This festival was established to share Black people’s stories, journeys, and experiences from their lens, and it has to be conceived as a way to deconstruct the dominant narratives, but also construct new ones driven by a deep sense of self-determination.</p><p>The program seeks to leave a lasting imprint by opening up the discussion with multiple guests and moderators and engage with the public. The festival will offer them space to deliver their thoughts and critical views on the oppressive nature of Italian contemporary society.<br/><br/><br/><strong>WHY WE NEED YOU TO SUPPORT US</strong></p><p>To support the launch of this festival, we are raising funds to cover organizational costs and staff salaries.</p><p>To avoid replicating the exploitative working conditions of the cultural and entertainment sectors, and, of non-white workers specifically. The guests, collaborators, and moderators will receive a fair fee for their contribution.

A way to express oneself, a human necessity. However, despite art being such an instinctive and visceral need, it is undeniably a privilege to have access to it as audience and as an artist.

How are they portrayed by traditional media? In Italy, a strongly racist language has been pervading the TV, newspapers’ headlines, and the radio. We are the spectators of a mediatic circus that has normalized the use of the N-word, or vilified terms such as “the immigrant,” “the migrant,” “the Nigerian,” “the Moroccan.” For the longest time, we have been described as stereotyped, violent, or hypersexualized subjects, who are unable to tell our own stories.

In Italia, le vite dei neri sono perennemente inquadrate da uno sguardo eurocentrico e bianco. Tale sguardo contribuisce all’eliminazione delle complessità e delle sfumature che attraversano le comunità nere e di colore.</p><p>Questo festival nasce dalla volontà di condividere storie, viaggi ed esperienze attraverso lo sguardo delle comunità interessate ed è concepito come un modo per decostruire le narrazioni dominanti ma anche per costruirne di nuove attraverso un senso profondo di autodeterminazione.<br/><br/>Il programma vuole lasciare un segno aprendo la discussione a più ospitə e moderatorə e coinvolgendo anche il pubblico.

In Italy, Black lives are perpetually framed by a Eurocentric gaze. Such a gaze contributes to the erasure of the complexities and nuances that form the Black and POC communities.This festival was established to share Black people’s stories, journeys, and experiences from their lens, and it has to be conceived as a way to deconstruct the dominant narratives, but also construct new ones driven by a deep sense of self-determination.The program seeks to leave a lasting imprint by opening up the discussion with multiple guests and moderators and engage with the public. The festival will offer them space to deliver their thoughts and critical views on the oppressive nature of Italian contemporary society.WHY WE NEED YOU TO SUPPORT USTo support the launch of this festival, we are raising funds to cover organizational costs and staff salaries.To avoid replicating the exploitative working conditions of the cultural and entertainment sectors, and, of non-white workers specifically. The guests, collaborators, and moderators will receive a fair fee for their contribution. The founders believe that it is of the utmost importance to properly pay all the people involved in the festival.One part of the budget will support the second edition of Blackn[è]ss festival happening next year. Stay tuned for the new dates!Moreover, the funds will also be used to support the entire production of the audiovisual materials, and the communication of the festival.PROGRAMMEFRIDAY 01.10.2016.00 – 7.00 pmEvent opening with an interview to Silvia Rosi by Blackcoffee_pdc (live podcast)7.15 – 8:45 pmThe ART roundtable What is art? A way to express oneself, a human necessity. However, despite art being such an instinctive and visceral need, it is undeniably a privilege to have access to it as audience and as an artist. Another danger for art is to be narrated by third parties, taking away from the main subjects the right to tell their stories, and therefore take over their right to self-determination.Guests: Silvia Rosi, Marzio Emilio Villa, Muna MussieModerator: Jermay Gabriel Michael9:00 pmMusic session by Omar Gabriel Delnevo9.45 pm – 12.00 amDJ set with Kyrikou & SayriSATURDAY 02.10.2021 2.45 pm – 4.15 pmRoundtable about RACIAL PROFILING AND ITS EFFECTS ON MENTAL HEALTHHave you ever been stopped at a station, an airport, or on the street and felt you were the only one being stopped by the police among many people? If your answer is yes, it means you have probably experienced racial profiling. The expression describes the act of being identified as a potential danger/lawbreaker/undocumented immigrant because of your skin color. We will talk about the effects of racial profiling on the mental health of non-white people.Guests: Ariman Scriba, Hilal Beraki, Ronke Oluwadare Moderator: Khadim Loum5.30 pm – 6.30 pmRoundtable MUSIC Music is life. This recreational activity is what brings humans together. Blackn[è]ss fest will tackle, with a critical approach, the Black and non-white Italian music scene. How many non-white musicians and singers are part of a big record label? What is their perception of the musical events? Do they face discrimination in the entertainment world because of their race? Guests: Luca Neves, Adriana, Ismael CondoyModerator: David Blank7.15 – 8.00 pm Music session by Ismael Condoy9.00 pm – 12.00 amConcerts: Luca Neves, David Blank, Adriana Dj setSUNDAY 03.10.2021 2.00 pm – 3.30 pmRoundtable QTIBIPOC The skin color is not the only trait that makes individuals subject to discrimination. Another particularly discriminatory element is sexual orientation and gender identity. Often, it seems one fight is excluding the other, when in reality race, sexual orientation and gender identity intersect with the lives of minorities. We will tackle the argument during the roundtable QTIBIPOC (Queer, Trans, Inter, Black, Indigenous, Person of Color).Guests: Loredane Tshilombo, Saya, Omar Gabriel Delnevo4.00 pm – 5.00 pmSharing moments, collective reflections 5.30 pm – 7.00 pm Roundtable CINEMA MEDIA AND REPRESENTATIONHow Black and non-white people have been represented in the contemporary movie industry? How are they portrayed by traditional media? In Italy, a strongly racist language has been pervading the TV, newspapers’ headlines, and the radio. We are the spectators of a mediatic circus that has normalized the use of the N-word, or vilified terms such as “the immigrant,” “the migrant,” “the Nigerian,” “the Moroccan.” For the longest time, we have been described as stereotyped, violent, or hypersexualized subjects, who are unable to tell our own stories. We will talk more about this topic on Sunday 3/10 from 17:15 to 18:45 in via Tertulliano, 68.Guests: Leila Belhadj Mohamed, Alberto Boubakar Malanchino, Sonia GarciaModerator: Lina Giselle Murillo Martínez 7.30 pm – 8.30 pm Interview to Daphne Di Cinto, film director and screenwriter of “Il Moro”by Blackcoffee_pdc + viewing of the short film9.00 pmCommunal dinner PRESENTAZIONE Blackcoffee_pdc e Kirykou sono felici di presentare Blackn[è]ss fest, tre giorni di festival dall’1 al 3 ottobre 2021 ad Archive Milano​.Con Silvia Rosi, Luca Neves, Ronke Oluwadare, Ariman Scriba, Alberto Boubakar Malanchino, David Blank, Emmanuelle Maréchal, Leila Belhadj Mohamed, Khadim Loum, Daphne Di Cinto e tantə altrə, Blackn[è]ss fest propone una serie di eventi culturali per affrontare le politiche della rappresentazione di persone nere e di colore in Italia.Blackn[è]ss fest vuole contemporaneamente celebrare la Nerezza ed esporre come le persone nere e di colore siano soggette a discriminazione e violenza sistematica. In Italia, le vite dei neri sono perennemente inquadrate da uno sguardo eurocentrico e bianco. Tale sguardo contribuisce all’eliminazione delle complessità e delle sfumature che attraversano le comunità nere e di colore.Questo festival nasce dalla volontà di condividere storie, viaggi ed esperienze attraverso lo sguardo delle comunità interessate ed è concepito come un modo per decostruire le narrazioni dominanti ma anche per costruirne di nuove attraverso un senso profondo di autodeterminazione.Il programma vuole lasciare un segno aprendo la discussione a più ospitə e moderatorə e coinvolgendo anche il pubblico. Il festival vuole creare uno spazio di condivisione attraverso riflessioni e visioni critiche sulla natura oppressiva della società contemporanea italiana.PERCHÉ ABBIAMO BISOGNO DEL TUO SOSTEGNOPer sostenere la prima edizione del festival, stiamo raccogliendo fondi per coprire i costi organizzativi e dello staff.Abbiamo bisogno del tuo sostegno per non replicare le condizioni svantaggiose offerte dal settore culturale e dello spettacolo, in particolare nei confronti di persone razzializzate. Gli ospiti, i collaboratori e i moderatori riceveranno un giusto compenso per il loro contributo. I fondatori credono fermamente nell’importanza di pagare adeguatamente tutte le persone coinvolte nel festival.Qualora la campagna di crowdfunding raccolga fondi adeguati, verrà sostenuta anche la seconda edizione del Blackn[è]ss festival che si terrà nel 2022. Vi teniamo aggiornati per le nuove date!PROGRAMMAVENERDì 01.10.202118:00 – 19:00 Opening con l’artista Silvia Rosi e intervista a cura di blackcoffee podcast live19:15 – 20:45Tavolo ARTECos’è l’arte? Un modo di esprimersi potremmo dire. Una necessità umana. Ebbene, anche qualcosa di così viscerale e istintivo può essere privato del privilegio di poter accedervi, sia come fruitorə che come creatorə. O ancora, l’arte può incorrere nel rischio di essere raccontata da soggetti terzi, privando lə stessə protagonistə del diritto all’autonarrazione e all’autodeterminazione.Speaker: Silvia Rosi, Marzio Emilio Villa, Muna MussieModera: Jermay Gabriel Michael21:00Sezione ascolto con Omar Gabriel Delnevo, pianista21:45 – 00:00Dj set Kirykou & Sayri SABATO 02.10.202114:45 – 16:15 Tavolo PROFILAZIONE RAZZIALE ED EFFETTI SULLA SALUTE MENTALETi è mai capitato di essere fermatə nei pressi di una stazione, di un aeroporto o per strada e avere l’impressione di essere l’unicə a essere fermatə in mezzo a molte altre persone? Se la risposta è sì, probabilmente hai vissuto un’esperienza di profilazione su base razziale, ovvero l’essere identificatə come soggetto pericoloso/fuorilegge/ o privo di documenti in base al colore della tua pelle. Parleremo degli effetti della profilazione razziale sulla psiche dei soggetti razzializzati.Speaker: Ariman Scriba, Hilal Beraki, Ronke OluwadareModera: Khadim Loum17:00 – 18:30Tavolo MUSICALa musica è vita.

Quantə musicistə razzializzatə sono presenti nelle major discografiche? Qual è la percezione che hanno degli eventi musicali? Esiste una discriminazione rispetto alla loro fisicità nel campo dello spettacolo?
