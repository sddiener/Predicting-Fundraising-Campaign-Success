<p></p>
<p>Children today are advanced in a way that kids were not even fifteen years ago. Technology is ever changing and so is how our children communicate and socialize with other people, along with that comes
different kinds of threats and ways children can be bullied.<br/><br/>The negative and fatal effects of bullying are becoming more evident within our society. With suicides at an all-time high and an increase in violence resulting from bullying, the need for proactive solutions and intervention has risen greatly. Over the years, the face of bullying has changed, as well as the tools and methods used to assist the attacker.<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/505999/files/20140413172933-stats.PNG?1397435373"" src="""" style=""width: 578.11px; height: 234px;""/><br/>Internet, social media, cell phones, personal handheld devices, and many other electronic tools have enabled the attacker, allowing them to improve the
effectiveness of their attacks, without ever facing their victim. Parents, guardians,
and school professionals; must become proactive in their efforts to deter those who
commit acts of bullying against others.<br/><br/>To address bullying concerns with our own children, a concerned parent drafted an idea for an application for smart phones and a software package for schools. This software would help parents, guardians, teachers, and students to be able to aggressively tackle/reduce bullying. After mentioning the application to peers, an overwhelming interest was shown in the application. After close consideration, a group of information technology professionals with families were selected, to equally take ownership of the idea, and formed Simple People Studios.<br/><br/></p>

While we have worked extremely hard to get this idea launched into an actual product, there are some hard costs associated with bringing this application to the market. We humbly ask you to join us in helping launch the Guardian © Bullying Application. The following outlines the project expenses that we would like assistance with:<div><div>

<p><br/>If we do not reach our goal we will still use the funds to launch and
help maintain the Guardian © Bullying Application. We have already researched and spoken to several
schools who are very interested in the development of this mitigation application. Our

<br/>There are many other things we would like to do with Guardian © Bullying Application additional money raised will be put to good use to expand the application and its resources.<br/><br/>Along with the personal device application the goal is to develop a School/District Software Package program that will work along
with the personal device application. It will be compatible with Microsoft,
Android, and Apple devices:<span style=""color: rgb(102, 51, 102); font-style: italic;""></span><br/><br/>- This package would be developed for and purchased by individual school districts.<br/><br/>- Client applications would be developed for student workstations, school and student owned mobile or

Purpose And Goals For The Future:

Children today are advanced in a way that kids were not even fifteen years ago. Technology is ever changing and so is how our children communicate and socialize with other people, along with that comes
different kinds of threats and ways children can be bullied.The negative and fatal effects of bullying are becoming more evident within our society. With suicides at an all-time high and an increase in violence resulting from bullying, the need for proactive solutions and intervention has risen greatly. Over the years, the face of bullying has changed, as well as the tools and methods used to assist the attacker.Internet, social media, cell phones, personal handheld devices, and many other electronic tools have enabled the attacker, allowing them to improve the
effectiveness of their attacks, without ever facing their victim. Parents, guardians,
and school professionals; must become proactive in their efforts to deter those who
commit acts of bullying against others.To address bullying concerns with our own children, a concerned parent drafted an idea for an application for smart phones and a software package for schools. This software would help parents, guardians, teachers, and students to be able to aggressively tackle/reduce bullying. After mentioning the application to peers, an overwhelming interest was shown in the application. After close consideration, a group of information technology professionals with families were selected, to equally take ownership of the idea, and formed Simple People Studios.

We have developed a prototype for an application for smart phones and an overall software package for schools, that will help children and authority figures to capture and record bullying. While we have worked extremely hard to get this idea launched into an actual product, there are some hard costs associated with bringing this application to the market. We humbly ask you to join us in helping launch the Guardian © Bullying Application. The following outlines the project expenses that we would like assistance with:

Should we exceed our initial goal; the additional money raised will be
used to pay toward the balance of the programming and other launch costs along with maintenance fees that acquire over time. 
If we do not reach our goal we will still use the funds to launch and
help maintain the Guardian © Bullying Application. We have already researched and spoken to several
schools who are very interested in the development of this mitigation application. Our
number one goal is to help children and adults in the fight to stop bullying.As a backer, we will be keeping you informed through email on how the project is doing and what we have accomplished every month.If you can help financially or not, please help us by getting
the word out; 
Please share from the following: Twitter, Facebook, reddit, and email to help us reach our goals.What
Guardian © Bullying Application Will Be
Capable Of:



We have
developed a prototype for an application for smart phones that will
help children and authority figures capture and record bullying. Some of
the options we are working on while developing this application are:

-Designed
for Personal cellular, handheld, tablet device application/s,
and to be
compatible with Apple, Android. and Microsoft
devices.-The
application will easily activate in a way that will reduce
the possibility of being identified by the offender.

-It
will provide a user interface for parents/guardians to configure
phone numbers and emails.-It
will send emails and text messages to all configured numbers,
previously configured by parents/guardians when the
application is activated.-
It will activate phones camera/video and audio recording software to record the event when the application is
activated. -
Will store the events in the applications database for
retrieval by parents/guardians, school officials,
law enforcement, etc., in order to identify, discipline, or provide evidence
of the event/s.-
Parents/guardians ability to add or edit data related to the offender in the even database.-
Parents/guardians ability to query the events database and/or print reports for tracking of incidents.-
RSS Feed to distract or disguise the activated application. Feed will be selected by parent.
 
Hope For The Future:



There are many other things we would like to do with Guardian © Bullying Application additional money raised will be put to good use to expand the application and its resources.Along with the personal device application the goal is to develop a School/District Software Package program that will work along
with the personal device application. It will be compatible with Microsoft,
Android, and Apple devices:- This package would be developed for and purchased by individual school districts.- Client applications would be developed for student workstations, school and student owned mobile or
handheld devices, including iPods, iPads, Microsoft, and Android devices.
- Server application would be developed and work in cooperation with present architecture.- All client devices would perform same or similar tasks as in personal device application, but would also inject the data into server database metrics, resolution, and data mining by stat and local agencies. All state and federal compliance must be met.

I am majoring in Elementary Education with an emphasis on Special Education.</p><p>For years now I have felt God calling me to serve in the nations but I have never been able to pinpoint an exact location. I have always known I wanted to serve in Africa but I could never decide on a specific village, city, or even a location. My mom has always told me ""If God wants you to go on a mission trip, He will tell you. He will open all of the doors and you will without a doubt know that He is calling you to go. You will not have to look for a trip because God will show you where He wants you."" I have constantly been repeating this to myself for the past three years as I have been patiently waiting for a sign from God that this is what He has in store for me. Finally, at the beginning of my 2014 spring semester at Baylor, an organization called Buckner International came and told us about different mission opportunities they offered during the summer. After hearing everything Buckner had to offer I knew this was exactly what I had been waiting for for so many years. I decided to apply into the program. I knew if I was accepted into the program that my mission plans would soon start to move full speed ahead but if I didn't get in, this was God's way of telling me that this was not what He had in store for me right now. I would be ok with either answer God had for me. After a long interview process and weeks of waiting, praying, and biting my nails I had my answer. On Friday, February 21 I was informed that I had been accepted into Buckner International for Project Go! On July 7, 2014 I will officially be flying to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia to begin this exciting and life changing journey God has in store for me. Not only will I get to spend my time in Ethiopia spreading the word of God but I will get to spend my time with the humblest of individuals. I get to share the word of God to the broken and the hurt and show them the abounding love that their Father has for them. While in Ethiopia, I will be assisting in social work home visits, teaching my own classes of english and reading to elementary schoolers along with any other subject, assisting other teachers, teaching a Bible class, leading recreation and Bible studies and helping in the clinic. I will be in Ethiopia from July 7 through August 7. </p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">God has provided me with this wonderful journey to share His love and grace to the people of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia and I am beyond blessed to have gotten this opportunity. While I am fully confident that God will provide a way for me to raise the funds in order to go on this trip, I need all the help I can get. I would also appreciate any </span>prayers and encouragement along the way. This is a new and exciting journey for me but I give all the credit and thanks to God because it is because of Him that I am going on this trip. The Lord is my sole purpose for going on this trip. I want to be able to share His word with as many people as I possibly can while in Ethiopia. My goal is to show them that God's love is the greatest love they could ever hope to find. Most importantly I want to be able to show them not only through my own life but throughout their life as well that they too can have a Heavenly Father who is always there for them and a King who encourages and loves them more than they could ever imagine. </p><p>Thank you so much for your prayers and donations!

Our current truck is unreliable (and now too small) and our dads have been keeping it limping along, but eventually the time will come when the kids will be at competition and their instruments will not. </p>
<p>Having met with a local dealership, and through research, we are looking at a cost of approximately $80K for each truck.  We're not opposed to used vehicles, but we have learned that trucks this size typically have high mileage on them already as they are moving trucks, and we'd likely be in the same situation in the near future with the purchase of used. Also, a 26-foot long truck is the largest we can drive without a commercial license. </p>
<p>Additional funding above and beyond our goal will go to the general fund for the band to pay for the expenses mentioned earlier - like more instruments and competition costs. If we don't reach our goal, we will still earmark all donations for our truck fund, first and foremost. </p>

...two words that conjure up more memories than you can count. It's four years of hard work and add an extra curricular activity to the mix and you have a very busy student. But if you're lucky, and your child becomes part of a program whose members, director and parent volunteers are as committed, hard-working, and dedicated to the success of that program as we are as Band Boosters of Holly Springs High School in Holly Springs, NC, then your student also has a lot of FUN! 


THE Holly Springs High School  Golden Hawks Regiment
What has 230 legs but is not going anywhere? Our band program if we don't get 2 new trucks!! 

Up 20% from 2013 to 2014, our band program has grown to 160 members of which 115 are GHR marching members. This is a blessing and a curse if you can't keep up with your needs.  We have outgrown our truck space and transportation to events and competitions is now a very real challenge. The band programs in our school system receive limited funding every seven years to help with expenses. Last year we received $18K with which we purchased 3 instruments. All other costs of our $60K annual budget (uniforms, band camp meals, transportation, music, instructors, competition fees, etc) come from the parents (aka Band Boosters) and through fundraising year after year. We are fortunate to live in a community of people who are willing to provide the resources through donations and support that we rely on and of which we are so appreciative. But we now have a problem whose solution is beyond the scope of local fundraising and we need help.
Practice makes perfect....


If you were never in band in high school, and I was not, you probably are not aware of the amount of hours student musicians spend practicing. Our band camp (insert snicker here...""one time, at band camp..."") starts July 30 and includes 12-hour days for 3 weeks before school starts. And they love it~

   



  


Truck-a-GoGo
 The funds raised through this campaign will go specifically to the purchase of two 26-foot 'box' trucks, like a moving truck, to transport our instruments, uniforms, and props to competitions and performances. Our current truck is unreliable (and now too small) and our dads have been keeping it limping along, but eventually the time will come when the kids will be at competition and their instruments will not. 
Having met with a local dealership, and through research, we are looking at a cost of approximately $80K for each truck.  We're not opposed to used vehicles, but we have learned that trucks this size typically have high mileage on them already as they are moving trucks, and we'd likely be in the same situation in the near future with the purchase of used. Also, a 26-foot long truck is the largest we can drive without a commercial license. 
Additional funding above and beyond our goal will go to the general fund for the band to pay for the expenses mentioned earlier - like more instruments and competition costs. If we don't reach our goal, we will still earmark all donations for our truck fund, first and foremost. 


           


By helping us reach our goal, you'll be:



helping to keep the ARTS alive in our schools
teaching our students the benefits and rewards of working together
allowing our students to experience being a part of something bigger than themselves
encouraging hard work and dedication (did I mention 12-hour days at band camp for 3 weeks before school starts?) 
promoting team work  - winning and losing together 





We need you!...and everyone you know. 

 Even if you can't contribute, that doesn't mean you can't help. Help us get the word out and make some noise about our campaign. Use the Indiegogo share tools to post, tweet and send our campaign to everyone you know. All donations are tax deductible!

Since 2013, SociopreneurlD has been promoting social entrepreneurship spirit to Indonesians through various programs. For the last five years, our own works have been driven by human interests and we found there is a need to change perception and improve creativity skills in order to be agile in this complex world. By promoting empathy through science, creativity, and innovation, we believe we can encourage various stakeholders including society to work together tackling various issues around them as a manifestation of collective—responsibility.
Recently, SociopreneurID has become one of examples at CIVICUS Youth Participation Platform on how to reach the youth by creating diverse programs, so they have various opportunities to participate in making positive impact to society and planet, find out more on: http://www.civicus.org/youth_engagement_toolkit/reaching-youth/

SociopreneurID Described in Numbers
Our journey for the last five years has helped to create 22.000 learners, 800 volunteers, 950+ solutions created, 400 collaborators, and 5000 books & educational tools donated. It is indeed a wonderful journey and through the community supports we are motivated to keep the spirit for years and years to come! But we realize we can't do this alone. That's why we developed a multi-stakeholders ecosystem in which every stakeholder takes responsibility to improve human quality.

<p>The story of Newill Academy started in 2010 when Mr. William Newman, a Ghanaian teacher founded a nursery in an empty storage building next to his mother's house in Koforidua. His aim is to provide quality daycare and education for children who suffer social disadvantage in the area, mainly the children of the market sellers and street vendors who can't afford to stay at home with them. As the children grew, the academy grew together with them, starting primary classes. The school works on a non-profit basis, the students pay a minimal fee which just covers the teacher's salary, transportation by the school bus and one meal per day.</p>
<p>Although the founder and headmaster of the school along with the board of teachers are working hard to provide their best for the pupils, in lack of proper financial background the academy is facing various challenges. First of all, it is overcrowded, the infrastructure is not sufficient enough for the amount of students. The children are keen on studying but instead of classrooms they are staying in temporary shelter-like structures exposed to the various weather conditions. Sanitary facilities also need improvement.</p>
<p>A group of European architects in close cooperation with the local management have revised the plans in 2016 and started the construction works of the low-cost sustainable school building during the summer holidays of 2016 and 2017.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1524140471/hjvdvl2kse2outkdc1u3.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>In order to keep building costs and future maintenance low, locally available materials, handmade structures, passive ventilation and a rainwater harvesting system are included. The bricks are handmade, produced on site by volunteers. Interior elements and parts of the facade are made of bamboo, harvested in the nearby forest. The elevated roof functions as a solar chimney, creating natural air movement when warmed up by the sun.</p>

<p>Die Geschichte der Newill Academy begann im Jahr 2010, als Herr William Newman, ein ghanaischer Lehrer einen Kindergarten in einem leeren Lagerhaus neben dem Haus seiner Mutter in Koforidua gründete. Sein Ziel ist es, qualitativ hochwertige Kindertagesstätten und Schulung für bedürftigte Kinder in der Region, vor allem die Kinder der Marktverkäufer und Straßenverkäufer, die nicht leisten können, zu Hause bleiben mit ihnen zu bleiben. Als die Kinder wuchsen, wuchs die Akademie zusammen mit ihnen, und primäre Klassen wurden gestartet. Die Schule arbeitet auf einer gemeinnützigen Basis, die Studenten zahlen eine minimale Gebühr, die nur das Lehrergehalt, den Transport durch den Schulbus und eine Mahlzeit pro Tag abdeckt.</p>
<p>Obwohl der Gründer und Schulleiter der Schule zusammen mit der Lehrkräfte hart daran arbeiten, das Beste für die Schüler zu geben, liegt die Akademie im Mangel an ordnungsgemäßem finanziellen Hintergrund vor verschiedenen Herausforderungen. Zuerst ist es überfüllt, die Infrastruktur reicht für die Anzahl der Schüler nicht aus. Die Kinder sind begeistert auf das Studium, aber anstatt der Klassenzimmer bleiben sie in temporären, schutzähnlichen Strukturen, die den verschiedenen Wetterbedingungen ausgesetzt sind. Sanitäranlagen müssen ebenfalls verbessert werden.</p>
<p>Eine Gruppe europäischer Architekten hat in enger Zusammenarbeit mit dem örtlichen Management die Pläne im Jahr 2016 überarbeitet und im Sommer 2016 mit den Bauarbeiten des kostengünstigen, nachhaltigen Schulgebäudes angefangen. In den nächsten Jahren sollen zwei weitere Bauphasen folgen, um die Akademie abzuschließen der komfortablen und passenden Platz für die 240 Schüler bietet.</p>
<p>Um Baukosten und zukünftige Instandhaltung niedrig zu halten, sind lokal verfügbare Materialien, handgefertigte Strukturen, passive Lüftung und ein Regenwassernutzungsanlage enthalten. Die Ziegel sind handgefertigt, produziert vor Ort von Freiwilligen. Innenelemente und Teile der Fassade sind aus Bambus gefertigt, im nahe gelegenen Wald gesammelt. Das erhöhte Dach dientsolar chimney als Solarkamin und erzeugt so eine natürliche Luftbewegung, wenn er von der Sonne aufgewärmt wird.</p>
<p>Das Projekt wurde vom Medienarchitekturpreis 2016 verliehen, einer der bedeutendsten Preise zeitgenössischer von Architektur in Ungarn. </p>

<p>Számos támogatónk nagylelkű adományának köszönhetően 2016 és 2017 nyarán felépíthettük a Newill Academy új iskolaépületének földszintjét és megkezdhettük az első emeleti falak építését. Ezek a szerkezetkész helyiségek már használatban vannak, megkönnyítve a 240 diák mindennapjait.  Gyűjtöttünk továbbá bambuszt melyet előkészítettünk a homlokzaton való felhasználásra.</p>
<p>Idén az augusztusi tanítási szünetben az első emeleti három tanterem és könyvtárhelyiség befejezését tervezzük, valamint a legfelső szint falainak felállítását.</p>
<p>A beérkezett adományokat teljes egészében a Newill Academy fejlesztésére fordítjuk, elsősorban építőanyagok vásárlására és a helyi munkaerő bérének fedezésére. A munka javát önkéntesekből álló csapatunk fogja elvégezni. Légy te is a változás részese! Támogathatsz minket név nélkül is, de örömmel könszönetet mondanánk nagylelkűségedért amennyiben az alábbi opciók közül választasz és megadod elérhetőséged.</p>
<p>A Newill Akadémia története 2010-ben kezdődött, amikor William Newman, egy helyi tanár az édesanyja koforiduai háza melletti üres melléképületben egy szociális alapon működő óvodát és általános iskolát indított. Az intézmény hiánypótló, hiszen a városban nem, illetve csak nagyon drágán áll rendelkezésre hasonló ellátás, a hátrányosabb helyzetű szülők a mindennapi megélhetés előteremtésével vannak elfoglalva, nem tudnak családjukkal otthon maradni. Az intézmény aztán az évek során a gyerekekkel együtt nőtt, és hamarosan általános iskolai osztályok is indultak.</p>
<p>Az évek alatt az iskola kinőtte az eredeti épületet, mára több osztály terem híján folyosókon vagy az udvaron felállított egyszerű tető alatt tanul. Már évekkel ezelőtt tervek készültek az iskola fejlesztésére, megfelelő anyagi háttér hiányában azonban csak egy új épülettömb alapozása és lábazata készült el.</p>
<p>Ekkor magyar építészek egy lelkes csoportja a helyi vezetéssel együttműködve és a fenntarthatóságot valamint a klimatikus viszonyokat szem előtt tartva továbbfejlesztették a terveket. Az eredeti tervekből megmaradt a 3 szintes épület és az L alakú alaprajz, optimalizálva lett viszont a nyílásosztás, a közlekedés rendszere, továbbá közösségi terek kerültek kialakításra és az udvarral való kapcsolat is át lett fogalmazva. Trópusi éghajlaton a legfontosabb tervezési szempont az árnyékolás és szellőzés biztosítása, ezt mélyen ülő lamellás ablakokkal, nagy tetőkinyúlással, az osztálytermek perforált falaival valamint a folyosó felőli oldalon hézagos bambusz homlokzati burkolattal igyekeztünk elérni. A zárófödémtől elemelt fémlemez tető hamar felmelegszik ezért napkéményként tud működni, a felszálló meleg levegő elvét kihasználva biztosítja a tantermek természetes szellőzését.</p>
<p>A projekt 2016-ban elnyerte a média Építészeti Díja közönségdíját, mely a kortárs építészet egyik legjelentősebb elismerése Magyarországon.</p>

Die Schule arbeitet auf einer gemeinnützigen Basis, die Studenten zahlen eine minimale Gebühr, die nur das Lehrergehalt, den Transport durch den Schulbus und eine Mahlzeit pro Tag abdeckt.
Obwohl der Gründer und Schulleiter der Schule zusammen mit der Lehrkräfte hart daran arbeiten, das Beste für die Schüler zu geben, liegt die Akademie im Mangel an ordnungsgemäßem finanziellen Hintergrund vor verschiedenen Herausforderungen. Zuerst ist es überfüllt, die Infrastruktur reicht für die Anzahl der Schüler nicht aus. Die Kinder sind begeistert auf das Studium, aber anstatt der Klassenzimmer bleiben sie in temporären, schutzähnlichen Strukturen, die den verschiedenen Wetterbedingungen ausgesetzt sind. Sanitäranlagen müssen ebenfalls verbessert werden.
Eine Gruppe europäischer Architekten hat in enger Zusammenarbeit mit dem örtlichen Management die Pläne im Jahr 2016 überarbeitet und im Sommer 2016 mit den Bauarbeiten des kostengünstigen, nachhaltigen Schulgebäudes angefangen. In den nächsten Jahren sollen zwei weitere Bauphasen folgen, um die Akademie abzuschließen der komfortablen und passenden Platz für die 240 Schüler bietet.
Um Baukosten und zukünftige Instandhaltung niedrig zu halten, sind lokal verfügbare Materialien, handgefertigte Strukturen, passive Lüftung und ein Regenwassernutzungsanlage enthalten. Die Ziegel sind handgefertigt, produziert vor Ort von Freiwilligen. Innenelemente und Teile der Fassade sind aus Bambus gefertigt, im nahe gelegenen Wald gesammelt. Das erhöhte Dach dientsolar chimney als Solarkamin und erzeugt so eine natürliche Luftbewegung, wenn er von der Sonne aufgewärmt wird.
Das Projekt wurde vom Medienarchitekturpreis 2016 verliehen, einer der bedeutendsten Preise zeitgenössischer von Architektur in Ungarn.

Számos támogatónk nagylelkű adományának köszönhetően 2016 és 2017 nyarán felépíthettük a Newill Academy új iskolaépületének földszintjét és megkezdhettük az első emeleti falak építését. Ezek a szerkezetkész helyiségek már használatban vannak, megkönnyítve a 240 diák mindennapjait.  Gyűjtöttünk továbbá bambuszt melyet előkészítettünk a homlokzaton való felhasználásra.
Idén az augusztusi tanítási szünetben az első emeleti három tanterem és könyvtárhelyiség befejezését tervezzük, valamint a legfelső szint falainak felállítását.
A beérkezett adományokat teljes egészében a Newill Academy fejlesztésére fordítjuk, elsősorban építőanyagok vásárlására és a helyi munkaerő bérének fedezésére. A munka javát önkéntesekből álló csapatunk fogja elvégezni. Légy te is a változás részese! Támogathatsz minket név nélkül is, de örömmel könszönetet mondanánk nagylelkűségedért amennyiben az alábbi opciók közül választasz és megadod elérhetőséged.
A Newill Akadémia története 2010-ben kezdődött, amikor William Newman, egy helyi tanár az édesanyja koforiduai háza melletti üres melléképületben egy szociális alapon működő óvodát és általános iskolát indított. Az intézmény hiánypótló, hiszen a városban nem, illetve csak nagyon drágán áll rendelkezésre hasonló ellátás, a hátrányosabb helyzetű szülők a mindennapi megélhetés előteremtésével vannak elfoglalva, nem tudnak családjukkal otthon maradni. Az intézmény aztán az évek során a gyerekekkel együtt nőtt, és hamarosan általános iskolai osztályok is indultak.
Az évek alatt az iskola kinőtte az eredeti épületet, mára több osztály terem híján folyosókon vagy az udvaron felállított egyszerű tető alatt tanul. Már évekkel ezelőtt tervek készültek az iskola fejlesztésére, megfelelő anyagi háttér hiányában azonban csak egy új épülettömb alapozása és lábazata készült el.
Ekkor magyar építészek egy lelkes csoportja a helyi vezetéssel együttműködve és a fenntarthatóságot valamint a klimatikus viszonyokat szem előtt tartva továbbfejlesztették a terveket. Az eredeti tervekből megmaradt a 3 szintes épület és az L alakú alaprajz, optimalizálva lett viszont a nyílásosztás, a közlekedés rendszere, továbbá közösségi terek kerültek kialakításra és az udvarral való kapcsolat is át lett fogalmazva. Trópusi éghajlaton a legfontosabb tervezési szempont az árnyékolás és szellőzés biztosítása, ezt mélyen ülő lamellás ablakokkal, nagy tetőkinyúlással, az osztálytermek perforált falaival valamint a folyosó felőli oldalon hézagos bambusz homlokzati burkolattal igyekeztünk elérni. A zárófödémtől elemelt fémlemez tető hamar felmelegszik ezért napkéményként tud működni, a felszálló meleg levegő elvét kihasználva biztosítja a tantermek természetes szellőzését.
A projekt 2016-ban elnyerte a média Építészeti Díja közönségdíját, mely a kortárs építészet egyik legjelentősebb elismerése Magyarországon.

</h2> <p><b>Update 4 (Nov. 28): </b>we're down to the final stretch! I've added one new perk (<b>Digital Tutor</b>) and I've greatly improved the workshop offering (2-days -&gt; 5-days, same price). I'll be writing a detailed overview of the workshops soon, to better explain what that looks like for interested supporters.<br/></p>
<p>I'll be working actively this coming week to communicate more broadly and help make this happen. Thanks so much to everyone who has funded this effort so far!<br/></p>
<p><b>Update 3 (Nov. 05):</b> realizing that I perks are immutable once received, I can't request a shipping address on the existing Full Sponsor perk. If you'd like to receive a print copy of the book along with the benefits of being a Full Sponsor, I've created a new perk that does exactly that. Thanks for all your support!<br/></p>
<p><b>Update 2 (Nov. 05): </b>clarification - all Full Sponsor tier supporters will receive 1 print copy of the book.<b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>Update 1 (Nov. 02): </b>by popular demand, shipping for print copies is now available internationally!</p>
<p>Hi! My name is <a href=""https://twitter.com/queertypes"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Allele Dev</a>. I want to write a book that teaches Haskell for web development. It's my goal to provide a freely available text that builds on existing Haskell texts like:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=""http://book.realworldhaskell.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Real World Haskell</a></li>
<li><a href=""http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000929"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Parallel and Concurrent Haskell</a></li>
<li><a href=""http://haskellbook.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Haskell Programming From First Principles</a></li>
<li>
<a href=""http://www.yesodweb.com/book"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Haskell and Yesod</a><br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p>- with a focus on practical backend Haskell. I will expand on those books and provide more coverage on topics like:<br/></p>
<ul>
<li>Modern Haskell project, build, and dependency management</li>
<li>Library evaluation and selection: routing, JSON, storage, and more<br/>
</li>
<li>Data modeling with types: connecting logic to storage and views<br/>
</li>
<li>Testing: property-based, spec-based, doc-tests, and ad-hoc</li>
<li>Benchmarking: end-to-end and component-based</li>
<li>Profiling</li>
<li>Metrics collection, logging, and error-handling<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I've worked in Haskell web development for over a year
 now, in Haskell for three years, and in web development in 
general for three years. I'm comfortable <a href=""https://blog.cppcabrera.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">writing</a> on technical subjects, as well as writing <a href=""https://gitlab.com/u/cpp.cabrera"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">code</a>. I've taught Haskell at every company I've been employed at, and I've hosted two workshops teaching Haskell this year:</p>
<ul>
<li>Build Haskell Web Services (2h) @ <a href=""http://www.thestrangeloop.com/2015/build-haskell-web-services.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Strangeloop</a>
</li>
<li>Build Haskell Web Services (3.5h) @ <a href=""http://www.codemesh.io/codemesh2015/alej-cabrera"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Code Mesh</a><br/>
</li>
</ul>This book will be a gift from me to everyone, and it is exactly what I want to be working on. Help me make it happen!<br/>
</div><div><br/></div> <div> <h2>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h2>I want to work full-time on this book for 3 months. $20,000 covers my cost of living for that long.<br/><br/>For this much support, I guarantee that the following will be completed within 3 months. This is the core of the project:<br/><br/><ul>
<li>Source code (<a href=""https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">BSD-3</a> licensed) freely available with guaranteed reproducible builds via <a href=""https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">stack</a>
</li>
<li>Source for book chapters available under <a href=""http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">CC-BY-4.0</a> license</li>
<li>Instructions to build PDF/ePUB using <a href=""http://pandoc.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">pandoc</a>
</li>
<li>Exercises for each chapter</li>
<li>Solutions linked separately (spoiler-free!) for all exercises</li>
<li>Explanations for given solutions</li>
<li>Public issue tracker for typos/clarifications/etc.</li>
<li>Support for 3 months after the project for addressing issues</li>
</ul>
<p>The book will always be freely available.</p>
<p>Here is a preliminary outline of the book chapters:</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1446287279/v4keq4flp1h4dacdpigy.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><b>Testing</b> will be a focus throughout. After being introduced in chapter 4, tests will be used along with code snippets when introducing new ideas. This will develop a coding style that makes effective use of types where possible, yet continues to validate assumptions during development.<br/></p>
<p>Each chapter will also give some coverage to relevant, alternative libraries. There's many ways to do things in Haskell, and I intend to  provide a sampling of that variety.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2>Perks</h2>
<p>Several perks are being offered in the process of writing this book. I plan to begin servicing them as soon as the funding goal is reached. I will dedicate 30 hours per month towards perk fulfillment and 120-140 hours per month towards book writing.</p>
<p>Some perks allow you to pre-purchase a print version of the book. Currently, I plan to use Amazon CreateSpace publishing services for generating print copies of the book. These will be delivered at the end of the 3-month writing period and will contain:</p>
<ul>
<li>table of contents</li>
<li>CC-BY 4.0 license text<br/>
</li>
<li>core content, including relevant in-line code snippets<br/>
</li>
<li>exercises</li>
<li>select solutions<br/>
</li>
<li>index</li>
</ul>
<p>Stretch goal content will be released progressively thereafter in digital-only form.</p>
<p>For now, delivery of the print copies of the books is limited to the USA. I will investigate international shipping options and determine how to provide this perk for international backers.</p>
<p>For all perks, the following terms apply:</p>
<ul><li>I refuse to promote slurs or bigoted content. This applies especially to tweets and sponsor-style perks.</li></ul>
<div><br/></div>
<h2>Underfund Goals</h2>
<p>If I do not meet the goals, here's what can be expected:</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1446277932/dmfvmelulreefxirjwng.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<div><br/></div>
<br/><h2>Stretch Goals</h2>
<p>If I do meet the minimum goal, there's a lot more I can write about to make the coverage more comprehensive! In particular, I can add chapters on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Frontend development: <a href=""http://www.purescript.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">PureScript</a>, <a href=""http://elm-lang.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Elm</a>, <a href=""https://github.com/ghcjs/ghcjs"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">GHCJS</a>, <a href=""https://github.com/omcljs/om"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Om</a>, etc.</li>
<li>Haskell HTTP API Clients<br/>
</li>
<li>Foreign Function Interface: C, Rust, C++</li>
<li>Other serialization: XML, HTML, etc.<br/>
</li>
<li>More abstraction and type techniques for safer code</li>
<li>Performance tuning</li>
<li>Advanced authentication/authorization</li>
<li>Interfacing with other systems</li>
<li>Additional storage engines: document stores, file system, etc.</li>
<li>Caching<br/>
</li>
<li>Data streaming<br/>
</li>
</ul>If I make it to the minimum funding point, I will announce a poll that allows funders to choose in what order these will be addressed. You're welcome to suggest additional topics of interest.<br/><br/>For every additional $3000, I will dedicate half a month towards providing coverage on one of these topics in the order determined by poll votes.<br/><br/><br/>
<h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2>
</div><div>The primary risk is that I won't be able to write the core of the book in three months.<br/><br/>In the case that I don't complete the primary content in three months for whatever reason, here's the contingency plan:<br/><ul>
<li>Dedicate a quarter of my time each month towards completing the book<br/>
</li>
<li>Seek additional funding via <a href=""https://www.patreon.com/queertypes?ty=h"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Patreon</a> to cover my living costs</li>
</ul>
<p>Content will be published while the book is in development, so you'll be able to track progress!<br/></p>
<p>Another potential risk: what if breaking changes appear in the Haskell web development ecosystem? Here's a few possibilities and how I plan to deal with them:</p>
<ul>
<li>New compiler, GHC 8.0: book targets GHC 7.10 and ensures builds via stack</li>
<li>Library changes will be dealt with similarly<br/>
</li>
</ul>

 Update 4 (Nov. 28): we're down to the final stretch! I've added one new perk (Digital Tutor) and I've greatly improved the workshop offering (2-days -> 5-days, same price). I'll be writing a detailed overview of the workshops soon, to better explain what that looks like for interested supporters.
I'll be working actively this coming week to communicate more broadly and help make this happen. Thanks so much to everyone who has funded this effort so far!
Update 3 (Nov. 05): realizing that I perks are immutable once received, I can't request a shipping address on the existing Full Sponsor perk. If you'd like to receive a print copy of the book along with the benefits of being a Full Sponsor, I've created a new perk that does exactly that. Thanks for all your support!
Update 2 (Nov. 05): clarification - all Full Sponsor tier supporters will receive 1 print copy of the book.
Update 1 (Nov. 02): by popular demand, shipping for print copies is now available internationally!
Hi! My name is Allele Dev. I want to write a book that teaches Haskell for web development. It's my goal to provide a freely available text that builds on existing Haskell texts like:

Real World Haskell
Parallel and Concurrent Haskell
Haskell Programming From First Principles

Haskell and Yesod


- with a focus on practical backend Haskell. I will expand on those books and provide more coverage on topics like:

Modern Haskell project, build, and dependency management
Library evaluation and selection: routing, JSON, storage, and more

Data modeling with types: connecting logic to storage and views

Testing: property-based, spec-based, doc-tests, and ad-hoc
Benchmarking: end-to-end and component-based
Profiling
Metrics collection, logging, and error-handling


I've worked in Haskell web development for over a year
 now, in Haskell for three years, and in web development in 
general for three years. I'm comfortable writing on technical subjects, as well as writing code. I've taught Haskell at every company I've been employed at, and I've hosted two workshops teaching Haskell this year:

Build Haskell Web Services (2h) @ Strangeloop

Build Haskell Web Services (3.5h) @ Code Mesh

This book will be a gift from me to everyone, and it is exactly what I want to be working on. Help me make it happen!
  What I Need & What You GetI want to work full-time on this book for 3 months. $20,000 covers my cost of living for that long.For this much support, I guarantee that the following will be completed within 3 months. This is the core of the project:
Source code (BSD-3 licensed) freely available with guaranteed reproducible builds via stack

Source for book chapters available under CC-BY-4.0 license
Instructions to build PDF/ePUB using pandoc

Exercises for each chapter
Solutions linked separately (spoiler-free!) for all exercises
Explanations for given solutions
Public issue tracker for typos/clarifications/etc.
Support for 3 months after the project for addressing issues

The book will always be freely available.
Here is a preliminary outline of the book chapters:


Testing will be a focus throughout. After being introduced in chapter 4, tests will be used along with code snippets when introducing new ideas. This will develop a coding style that makes effective use of types where possible, yet continues to validate assumptions during development.
Each chapter will also give some coverage to relevant, alternative libraries. There's many ways to do things in Haskell, and I intend to  provide a sampling of that variety.

Perks
Several perks are being offered in the process of writing this book. I plan to begin servicing them as soon as the funding goal is reached. I will dedicate 30 hours per month towards perk fulfillment and 120-140 hours per month towards book writing.
Some perks allow you to pre-purchase a print version of the book. Currently, I plan to use Amazon CreateSpace publishing services for generating print copies of the book. These will be delivered at the end of the 3-month writing period and will contain:

table of contents
CC-BY 4.0 license text

core content, including relevant in-line code snippets

exercises
select solutions

index

Stretch goal content will be released progressively thereafter in digital-only form.
For now, delivery of the print copies of the books is limited to the USA. I will investigate international shipping options and determine how to provide this perk for international backers.
For all perks, the following terms apply:
I refuse to promote slurs or bigoted content. This applies especially to tweets and sponsor-style perks.

Underfund Goals
If I do not meet the goals, here's what can be expected:



Stretch Goals
If I do meet the minimum goal, there's a lot more I can write about to make the coverage more comprehensive! In particular, I can add chapters on:

Frontend development: PureScript, Elm, GHCJS, Om, etc.
Haskell HTTP API Clients

Foreign Function Interface: C, Rust, C++
Other serialization: XML, HTML, etc.

More abstraction and type techniques for safer code
Performance tuning
Advanced authentication/authorization
Interfacing with other systems
Additional storage engines: document stores, file system, etc.
Caching

Data streaming

If I make it to the minimum funding point, I will announce a poll that allows funders to choose in what order these will be addressed. You're welcome to suggest additional topics of interest.For every additional $3000, I will dedicate half a month towards providing coverage on one of these topics in the order determined by poll votes.
Risks & Challenges
The primary risk is that I won't be able to write the core of the book in three months.In the case that I don't complete the primary content in three months for whatever reason, here's the contingency plan:
Dedicate a quarter of my time each month towards completing the book

Seek additional funding via Patreon to cover my living costs

Content will be published while the book is in development, so you'll be able to track progress!
Another potential risk: what if breaking changes appear in the Haskell web development ecosystem? Here's a few possibilities and how I plan to deal with them:

New compiler, GHC 8.0: book targets GHC 7.10 and ensures builds via stack
Library changes will be dealt with similarly

The caravan will be participating in a 10 day visit to connect, learn and share traditional methods of agriculture, seed saving, bee-keeping and exchanging of knowledge. <br/>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need <br/>
</h3>We need $1,400 to cover the deposit of $200 for each of us to participate. June 1st is our deadline for our deposit! The $200 will go towards the overall cost of $1,000 per person. The $1,000 will cover food, lodging, ground transportation, materials and organizational costs. 20% of this cost will go directly to the Zapatista Community/Schools for Chiapas.<br/><br/>Here is our tentative itinerary for the entire trip:<br/>Day 1: Fly out February 2015 (date TBA) and arrive to Villa Hermosa (VSA) in the state of Tabasco /1 hour drive to site at Maya Bell<br/>Day 2:  Orientation - settle in<br/>Day 3:  Visit Palenque <br/>Day 4:  Workshops<br/>Day 5:  Workshops<br/>Day 6:  Workshops<br/>Day 7:  Workshops<br/>Day 8:  Last day of Workshops <br/>Day 9:  Breakdown camp<br/>Day 10: Depart from Villahermosa<br/><br/>The $200 will go towards our deposit. After we pay our deposits we will be focusing on fundraising, building and preparing for the rest of the costs leading up to our departure in Feb 2015, which would be the remaining $800 per person.<br/><br/>(Watch our for our next phase of Indiegogo fundraising efforts!)<br/><br/>

Every Dollar Counts
Database and application development aren't cheap. Neither is thorough and responsible journalism. We are willing and prepared to start small and prove our worth by earning your trust, but we have a plan if we raise more than we're asking for. The more money we raise, the more stories we can tell. If we raise enough, we can begin hiring journalists to work in our office. Being able to file additional grants will help us to ensure operational costs are fully funded and sustainable.All donations made to our InDemand campaign are tax-deductible through the Institute for Non-Profit News (EIN: 27-2614911).$50,000: By reaching this benchmark on Kickstarter, The War Horse is now able to contract journalists to publish our first four (4) multimedia feature, and will hire a part-time administrative assistant.What If We Raise More Than Our Goal Through OnDemand?Thanks to the generous support of our backers on Kickstarter, we reached our initial goal.We're using InDemand to take things a step further. The same rules apply for EVERY dollar we raise. 100% of ALL money raised goes toward our storytelling. That means we can publish more stories. It also means we can file grant applications to help ensure longevity. Every $1 helps. If you're not on our list of backers, we hope you'll join us!“The best way to find out if you can trust somebody is to trust them.” - Ernest Hemingway
OUR ROLLOUT TIMELINE
During the last 20 months, The War Horse has also been generously donated more than $250,000 in non-monetary donations such as branding, financial and legal planning, non-profit sponsorship, logo design, 18 iMac computers, furniture, and a rent-free office space. We're prepared to move forward. We just need your help getting there. 
100% of Donations Used For TWO Things: 
Begin reporting and publishing our stories through freelancers and staff journalists
Grant writing to sustain future operations and growth

All donations made to our InDemand campaign are tax-deductible through the Institute for Non-Profit News (EIN: 27-2614911). By helping us continue to surpass our initial Kickstarter goal, you are giving us the opportunity to further develop our news outlet and the stories we will publish. If you can help us reach our goal and change journalism around the world, please pledge. We hope you will tell your friends and help us create a place where professional and community journalism come together with a purpose - to understand the topic at hand! We hope you'll join us on our journey and please visit our website!Semper Fidelis,Thomas J.

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>My name is Melissa Strojek and I am a struggling college student.  After nearly 20 years of being out of high school, I decided I wanted to achieve the dream of a degree in Computer Information Systems.  I have had to overcome a lot of adversity in my life, including being diagnosed with moderate sleep apnea which robbed me of my liveliness and nearly robbed me of my good health.  It was a major obstacle to overcome the first two quarters of school before my cpap treatment started to make a difference.  I finally have a normal energy level and avoided sleep apnea's ill affects on my health.  As tired as I was all the time, I managed to work a full time job and pull off all A's in my first quarter.  I live paycheck to paycheck and only receive a small amount of grant money.  I earned a scholarship this year that was given out at my college and I used it to help with my books.  I have student loans, but I am trying not to get too far in debt before I can get done.  I am inspired by my grandparents who were Polish immigrants and managed to come to this country with very little money, only the clothes on their back and poor conditions in the belly of a ship.  They worked hard and were very proud and grateful to be in this country with the opportunities of a lifetime.  If they can overcome the things they did, I know I can.  I also have to give credit to my mom who has been very supportive and has helped me in any capacity she has been able to.  I want to make them all proud by getting this degree and moving towards a bachelor's degree in the same field.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Finishing school with a degree would mean the world to me and those around me.  I want a career, not just a job and I have many dreams I want to accomplish with having that career.  The financial stability a career will give me will also help me fix up my house and achieve having a family of my own.  I would also some day like to take trip to Poland to see where my ancestors came from.  These things can only be accomplished if I am able to earn a decent living and expand my horizons.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What Is Needed &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I need approximately $3,500 to comfortably finish my associates degree.  This money will be applied to both tuition (after my grant/scholarship money is taken out) and for books.  I always buy used books and rent books whenever possible so as not to waste any money I have to spend.  I am limited in perks that I can offer at this time, but am willing to give something in return for your generosity.  The first perk I will offer is a shout out on my Facebook page.  The Second perk I will offer will be a shout out on my Facebook page and a hand written thank you letter.  The third perk I will offer is a shout out on my Facebook page, a hand written letter and a copy of my grades so you can see your investment in action.  The fourth perk I will offer is all of the previous items mentioned and a promise to donate to another education related cause on this website.  It would be like paying it forward.  I believe education is the key and everyone deserves a shot at it.<br/></p>

I need to raise £11,000 per year of study, and that is without accomodation or travel fees.. so I have a long way to go! Thank you so much for reading.

He is 18-years-old, and is just about to go into Grade 11 (his second last year of high school) at Sithembele Matiso Secondary School, in Nyanga. Nyanga has been rated as being the most dangerous township in Cape Town.</p><p>Somehow, Athi has managed to keep himself free of the gang culture in his home-town. One of the first things Athi told me about himself, was that he wants to become a doctor, and make a difference in his community. He wants to educate himself, and go to university, and improve his lot in life. However, up until this point, no one had ever told him that in order to do so, he would have to take Mathematics and Physical Sciences. As such, he neglected to take these subjects in Grade 10, and is having to pick them up in 2014, when he enters Grade 11. Though the teachers at his school are sincere in their efforts to educate their students, the reality of the situation is that this is an incredibly difficult challenge for someone who does not have regular access to the internet or quality learning materials and support.</p><p>There is an extra classes programme run at the University of Cape Town (UCT), called SHAWCO Shine, which I believe will be of immense help to Athi during the course of his studies next year. They offer English, Physical Science, and Mathematics classes, all of which Athi will be taking part in.</p><p>What We Need &amp; What You Get</p><p>In order for Athi to take part in SHAWCO Shine, he will need:</p><ul>
<li>R6683 (approximately $646) for the cost of the lessons themselves</li>
<li>R330 (approximately $32) for his registration fee for the programme</li>
<li>R500 (approximately $49) for the cost of his work books for the programme</li>
<li>R660 (approximately $64) for train- and taxi-fare for travelling to UCT from Nyanga once per week</li>
</ul><p>If the full amount if not raised before SHAWCO Shine requires their payments, I will pay in the difference.

He may not even go to med school. He may instead become a lawyer, or a chef. But he will very most likely have a child, maybe even a wife. If Athi is able to get the help he needs to be able to pass Mathematics and Physical Science next year, inspite of having missed out on a year's worth of both subjects, he will be able to offer this future family of his a far brighter future than the one he was offered as a child. He'll be able to have the chance to get a degree - an opportunity which is out of his reach without Mathematics, at the very least. He will be able to offer his child more security than he himself experienced as a child, and will not have to let his family go hungry because he doesn't have a job.</p><p>By contributing financially to this campaign, you can help give Athi the chance to make a difference future than the one statistically expected of him. And by helping change his life today, you can effect a small but significant and positive change on future generations.</p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p>I understand that not everyone is financially able to help Athi. However, if you can tutor Mathematics, or Physical Science, or if you can offer him a lift for part of the journey between UCT and Nyanga, or even if you can offer him a job, so that he can develop his sense of self-worth through honest work, it would be greatly appreciated. </p><p></p></div>","Back-groundMy name is Erin Versfeld.

New Mexico and California, I have extensive knowledge of the various
educational benchmarks and skill requirements expected at a given age. This is
reassurance for many Homeschool families who want to provide alternative
education, but also want their child to keep up academically.  </p>
<p>With a Masters of Professional Studies of
Multicultural and Humanistic Education, <b><i>Ms. Cohen's Homeschool Classroom</i></b> creates comfort
for all children by embracing their innate gifts and unique qualities,
facilitating an environment for self-confidence, discovery, truth, compassion and growth. </p>
<p>Our community supports child-centered
learning, critical theory, and promoting success for ALL student learning
styles, especially for children who have not enjoyed their learning experiences
in other settings. The building blocks of a multicultural/humanistic
approach foster cooperative yet independent learning.Surrounding students in a
learning environment that boosts communication and problem solving skills,

Classroom either full or part time Monday - Friday 8:30-2:30 depending on how
much a family wants to supplement their own Homeschool curriculum.
 Holding current elementary certifications K-6 in Massachusetts, New York,
New Mexico and California, I have extensive knowledge of the various
educational benchmarks and skill requirements expected at a given age. This is
reassurance for many Homeschool families who want to provide alternative
education, but also want their child to keep up academically.  
With a Masters of Professional Studies of
Multicultural and Humanistic Education, Ms. Cohen's Homeschool Classroom creates comfort
for all children by embracing their innate gifts and unique qualities,
facilitating an environment for self-confidence, discovery, truth, compassion and growth. 
Our community supports child-centered
learning, critical theory, and promoting success for ALL student learning
styles, especially for children who have not enjoyed their learning experiences
in other settings. The building blocks of a multicultural/humanistic
approach foster cooperative yet independent learning.Surrounding students in a
learning environment that boosts communication and problem solving skills,
students learn how to be in control of their own learning.
Where will the money go?1. We Want to MOVE!

The Homeschool Classroom
has grown in popularity since its inception in September 2011. Taking the leap to leave a government funded education program in order to create one out on my own
proved successful, however now that the Santa Fe homeschool community has
endorsed the program by sending their children to the classroom, we now need a
bigger space with a private enclosed yard.  Students need physical activity to keep the brain open to learning.  We need to be able to run around and play a good round of Zombie Tag before we tackle long division!  Money will go towards moving expenses and new tables, chairs and shelves for a bigger space!2.

<p><strong>Hello Friends/Alumni of ECE,</strong></p>
<p><br/>We hope that you are doing well wherever you are in the world. <br/>Following an initiative from fellow alumni who are currently teaching at the department we are reaching out to you to support a noble cause. The ECE department has included in its revised curriculum new courses that require additional laboratory facility. Since the department does not have (enough of) them, it is difficult to deliver as much as needed. Although the university does not have a budget problem, any purchase is required to pass through a lengthy bidding process which often takes up to 2 years. Moreover, suppliers of such educational materials are not interested in bids. Currently the department faces problems for the courses: Embedded Systems, Robotics&amp; Industrial Automation, Microcontrollers &amp; Interfacing. So far, they have been using 15 STK500 micro controller kits donated in 2009 by alumni of the department. One of the items that they need for the coming academic year is the ""Embedded Systems Education Board"". (<a href=""http://www.embeddedartists.com/products/education/edu_2148.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.embeddedartists.com/products/education/edu_2148.php</a>).<br/><br/>After an initiative from a faculty member and 2004 graduate,Getachew Teshome, a few alumni from year 2003 - 2007 met online to discuss on how we could meet this demand. Another faculty member and 2007 graduate,Daniel Dilbi, has already contacted a supplier who offered a 50% discount through a university program. After discussing and making researches, we have determined that a total of $5,000 is required to purchase and ship these boards to the department. We have thus opened an account for this purpose and we ask your kind contribution to meet our goal.<br/>We will also be discussing in our next meetings on ways of creating an Alumni Network, which we will share with you as we progress. Your suggestions in this regard are very welcome.<br/><br/>Thank you,<br/>AAU ECE Alumni Volunteer/Interim Group</p>

Students with Access to Worldclass Arts and Humanities Experiences
Send 3,000 Students to D.C. Cultural Institutions

The city of Washington, D.C., is rich in arts and culture but budget constraints often prevent the city’s public schools (of which, about 80% of the students are on free or reduced lunch) from taking advantage of its resources. The D.C. Arts and Humanities Education Collaborative is a non-profit 501(c)3 membership organization comprised of more than 70 of the world's premier cultural institutions, dedicated to providing 30,000 DC public and public charter school students with access to unparalleled arts and humanities experiences a year. We believe that arts access leads to student success! Since our founding 15 years ago in October of 1998, the Arts for Every Student (AFES) program has arranged for free tickets and transportation for 400,000 students in our nation's capital to our member’s curriculum-enriching fieldtrip opportunities!  

 
Students at the Corcoran Gallery of Art ""American Stories"" Tour where they investigate social studies and culture through the narratives presented in American works of art. The interaction includes discussion, writing activities and a studio art project.



We need your help!  We are looking to raise $20,000 to provide transportation and free tickets to 3,000 students to our member arts and humanities cultural institutions all over the D.C. Region! A trip to a theater or museum can positively change a student’s life forever by enhancing his or her creativity, curiosity, and enthusiasm for learning.

With your assistance students will have the opportunity to experience educational prgrams and performances at organizations such as The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, The Kreeger Museum, The National Geographic Museum, The Library of Congress, President Lincoln's Cottage, The Textile Museum, The Washington Bach Consort, The Museum of American History, and The Washington Ballet and many more. Click here for our full member's list.  Without the Arts for Every Student program program, many of the students would not get to experience these amazing cultural institutions.

<p>In December of 2010, THUNK, Northwestern University's first acapella group, took its fourth trip to Cape Town, South Africa to hold music education workshops for children and perform at several concert venues to raise money for youth affected by the HIV/AIDS epidemic.</p>
<p>This upcoming December, Thunk hopes to continue the tradition with Cape Town Project 2012. The Project will cost $40,000. It is not funded through the University and therefore will require the utmost efforts and contributions from Thunk's 17 current members. This money will go directly towards funding the trip itself as far as transportation, food, and lodging. We have set our goals with indiegogo at $5,000, but the costs are so high that any amount that we raise will be greatly appreciated. If, for some reason, we don't reach our goals on indiegogo, the missing funds will be supplemented by further fundraising on campus. No matter what, we are making this trip happen!</p>
<p>If successful, Thunk will be able to accomplish this year's incredible project of musical outreach and civic engagement to open up music for these children as a means of discovering their limitless potential, gaining confidence, and expressing themselves through the medium of music.

<h3>Why the Dharma School is important.</h3>
<p>Our children are our future. They are the hope of humanity as the challenges that face us around the world continue to escalate. These challenges call for a new kind of humanity and a new kind of leadership - one that is not based on power and will alone. But a humanity that is guided by the enduring qualities of wisdom and compassion. These are the qualities that lead to right action. One-pointed and altruistic, with the highest good as our goal.<br/><br/>Over time we are seeing a new kind of child emerge at the school. One who adopts an attitude of open-heartedness.<br/><br/>Who chooses to act from a clear sense of what is right.<br/>Who is learning to master conflict resolution. Who considers their impact on the world around them. Who is guided to seek the highest good for all.<br/><br/>We believe the world needs more children like this, children who will grow into adults with values and qualities than can make a true difference. Loving parents,<br/>compassionate leaders, benevolent business operators, caring workers, wise teachers, truthful politicians, true peace makers.<br/><br/>This is why the Daylesford Dharma School is important<br/></p>

<h3>History of the Dharma School</h3>
<p></p>The Daylesford Dharma School started as an inspiration from Geshe Konchok Tsering to his student Andrea Furness. She had requested advice about taking on a project in Mongolia or providing support for Buddhist nuns. Instead he challenged her to take on a bigger view that would be of greater benefit - start a Buddhist primary school here in her home town of Daylesford. Within 3 years and with a dedication effort that included many supporters,  Andrea opened the doors for the Dharma School's first intake of students in 2009. Fifteen eager children between the ages of 5 and 9 sat on the floor in the refurbished Daylesford  tennis club rooms,  with our first wonderful teacher Lynda.<br/><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/>Today in 2015 we are 60 students from prep to year 6, 4 classrooms, 12 dedicated staff, a kitchen garden and a nurturing learning environment.

THE BLASPHEMY LAW PROJECT</h4><p>Engage is a nonprofit  research and advocacy organization 
working on
Pakistan’s blasphemy law. The mass support for
this narrative makes it  a potent
legal instrument for intimidation, violence and enacting personal 
vendettas, and specific persecution of minorities.  We are attempting to
 deconstruct the law and its surrounding social narrative through the 
framework that informs it--the first attempt of its kind. Please take 
the time to go through the rest of our profile and the introductory 
video above which summarizes the problem and how we propose to address 
it.</p><h1>The Law</h1><p>The law

<h4>1.2. The Impact: Increase in Accusations by 17,500%</h4>
<p>Since the introduction of the more stringent form of the law, 
blasphemy accusations increased by around 17500 %. This staggering 
increase in the number of individuals accused of the offence shows that 
the law has been used as a tool of persecution and oppression. People 
did not simply become dramatically more 'blasphemous'. Rather, these 
numbers show that the blasphemy law has been understood to be a viable 
legal means to target groups and individuals, and has been used as such.</p>

working on
Pakistan’s blasphemy law. The mass support for
this narrative makes it  a potent
legal instrument for intimidation, violence and enacting personal 
vendettas, and specific persecution of minorities.  We are attempting to
 deconstruct the law and its surrounding social narrative through the 
framework that informs it--the first attempt of its kind. Please take 
the time to go through the rest of our profile and the introductory 
video above which summarizes the problem and how we propose to address 
it.The LawThe law 
(section 295-C of Pakistan Penal Code) holds that anyone convicted of 
the offense of blasphemy against the prophet Muhammad is to be awarded a
 fixed death penalty, with no possibility of a pardon or waiver.            1. Impact of the Problem

Mobs
 rampaged through the Joseph Colony neighbourhood of Lahore in March 
last year after blasphemy allegations against Sawan Masih emerged. —AFP

1.1. Exponential Increase in Blasphemy Accusations






Angry Pakistani demonstrators torch Christian's belongings during a protest over a blasphemy row in a Christian. 




1.2. The Impact: Increase in Accusations by 17,500%
Since the introduction of the more stringent form of the law, 
blasphemy accusations increased by around 17500 %. This staggering 
increase in the number of individuals accused of the offence shows that 
the law has been used as a tool of persecution and oppression. People 
did not simply become dramatically more 'blasphemous'. Rather, these 
numbers show that the blasphemy law has been understood to be a viable 
legal means to target groups and individuals, and has been used as such.

1.3. The Impact: Increase in Vigilante Violence by 2750%
 The social narrative attached to the perception of 
blasphemy, and perpetuated by the law, has resulted in an increase in 
extra-judicial or vigilante killings, by 2750%.  





Couple Beaten, Burned By Mob For Alleged Blasphemy


1.4. The Impact:  Persecution of Religious Minorities

Disproportionate number of cases registered particularly 
against religious minorities, that represent a small percentage of the 
total population, fostering a climate of extreme religious intolerance 
in the region.


2. Defining the
Problem

The law has gathered mass support through

The problem: In Ghana, over 60% of junior high school students
are unable to pass their high school entrance exam. That means these kids are
unable to receive any further education. Those that do pass often have to drop
out of High School prematurely because of their inability to afford their high
school fees ($15 USD per trimester). If they do graduate most students can’t
possibly afford to continue on to University. We now know that education does
not just affect those who receive it; it also ripples out to affect an entire
community.</p>
<p>Exponential
Education has found a way to help all three levels of school children in Ghana to succeed and advance their education. In each community that hosts one of our programs work, five high-achieving high school
students are selected to tutor five junior high students who are struggling to
pass their exit exams. Those high school students receive a stipend to help them
pay their school expenses and the junior high students get the help they need
to pass their exams so they can continue on to high school. The high school
students also have the opportunity to earn a university scholarship. Currently,
we work in 25 locations throughout Ghana that are helping nearly 750 students achieve their educational goals and improve their prospects for a more
fulfilling life—not to mention their potential for helping others to do the
same.</p>
<p>In an
exciting new initiative, we have recently partnered with the Peace Corps to
expand our tutoring programs in the Upper West, Western, and Eastern regions of
Ghana. We are seeking funding for Peace Corps volunteers as well as our program associates to institute the
Exponential Education tutoring system in new areas and give more students
a chance for a better education and a better life. Please help us make a
crucial change not only in the lives of our students but also in the communities
hosting our programs through this exciting new partnership with the Peace
Corps and our new volunteers.

<p>2 – we offer a bespoke design service for gift packaging.  We use gorgeous materials, including sustainably produced Lokta paper, bhutanese cloth, paper made from grasses and bamboo, cottons, linens, wood, bone and horn.  We make bags and boxes of every description, hand-turned buttons, notebooks and picture frames.<br/></p>
<p><b>Who we are</b></p>
<p>Tarascraft is self-help group of people with disabilities
in Kathmandu, Nepal.  We are skilled
artisans, making fine traditional products from sustainably produced materials.   Our disabilities mean that
it’s hard to get work and meet even our most basic needs.  We don’t want poverty, and we don’t want to
be reliant on external aid.  Please help
us become independent and successful in our small way.</p>
<p>Tarascraft was set up by Taranath Sigdel (Tara) who was
ostracised from his village at the age of eleven because of a disability.  He was lucky: he found a doctor who treated his condition, and now Tara has a BA in Business Studies and
seven years experience of quality control in the handcrafts sector in Nepal.  He is determined to help other disabled artisans gain employment by working as a group in Tarascraft. <br/></p>

<p>We have an online catalogue offering 54 items.  We plan to increase to 100 items, and change

<p><span>Education in the United States is improving but there is still much progress to be made. The problem is that the technology that is currently used in the classroom is very distracting for students, as they can exit out of applications at any time.

<p><span><b>Our Solution:</b></span></p>
<p>We intend to solve these problems with our Integrate education technology software, which is intended to consolidate <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">all programs that are used in education, while completely blocking out all outside distractions. There are three levels of access to information: Administrator, Teacher, and Student. Administration has master access to all data and can control which add-on features are accessible for the teacher's use. Teachers have the ability to limit the student's access to non-academic applications in real time. The heart of our software is the smart agenda which changes the environment based on the user’s class schedule.  When class begins, the teacher's screen will display class management features of the current class section, while students can only access appropriate applications and personal notes to the class they are currently in. Teachers will be able to seamlessly take attendance while teaching class, have easy lesson plan builders that adheres to the standards of their schools district, and will have access to a teacher sharing network. Integrate will also allow for third party content integration for programs that do not come standard.

    Risks & Challenges Our biggest challenge is working on Integrate full-time while having personal expenses. We are overcoming  this by freelancing while working on our projects as much as we can. This is why funding is so crucial!

We know we will be successful because:
Maxwell Witt Is the apprentice to Gerard Adams (Millennial Thought Leader, Serial Entrepreneur, and Angel Investor) who co-founded Elite Daily. Recently he helped start a non-profit called Fownders.
Kevin Celisca worked for EY and started a successful Non-Profit called CollegeLingual. 
Emmanuel Johnson is a PhD candidate of Artificial Intelligence and has interned for NASA. 

    Other Ways You Can Help We completely understand that not everyone can donate, but that doesn't mean you can't help! If you like us please share us on your social media with your friends and spread the word so we can revolutionize the education system together! We can't do it without you!",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

These challenges are small roadblocks to our success that can be over come with hard work. This past august, a received the terrible news that due to financial problems I was not going to be able to attend Penn state for my senior year of college. It devastated me as I had all my bags packed and I was eager to start my senior year of college and earn my degree in biochemistry and molecular biology. I have been out of school since then. I have been working as a tutor to be able to pay my bills so far but the money is scarce. I miss school and I must finish my degree in order to be happy. Education is my passion and every waking moment of this hiatus is killing me inside. Fortunately enough, on April I will be able to register for classes at Queensborough Community College for a semester so I don't fall behind and finish my senior year of college at City College of NY in the fall. The only problem is that I cannot register for the spring semester at QCC due to a balance that I owe them for some summer classes I took. This balance I had planned to pay with funds from a scholarship I receive every year but unfortunately the scholarship cannot diburse the funds to pay it off since I am not enrolled in classes currently. The total amount due is 4250 dollars. I am stuck in this dire situation and have been able to work and put together 750 dollars so far (after bills I've had to pay, etc). I still need 3500 dollars more to be able to register for classes. I need to be able to come up with this money by February 25. I hate having to ask for this type of help since Self reliance is huge to me but this is killing me inside. Any sort of help would go directly into paying this bill and would mean the world to me.

<p><strong>Why We Rise Up!</strong></p>
<p>Knowing the importance of a proper education and acknowledging the struggle of some parents to properly furnish their child for such a venture, Rise Up Bequia Inc.‘s initiative for the past five years has been to assist as best as we can. Our project began with the distribution of care packages and vouchers to students who were identified as having difficulties in acquiring necessities for school.  However, over the years we realized that the need for school supplies was much greater than we first expected or anticipated and so our annual summer vacation book drive was born.  Last year, 2017, we were able to supply over 350 students from seven schools on the island with notebooks, copybooks and stationery; this being a major step up from the 176 students of 2016 and even fewer in the years before. Unfortunately, because of the limited amount of books we were able to afford there were still students in need who were unable to be gifted with packages.</p>
<p>So as to ensure that no student is left disappointed or ill equipped in their quest to attain education, our goal for this year is to supply books to EVERY student on the island of Bequia. This would definitely be a herculean task and so we are soliciting your support to aid in the accomplishment of this very worthy cause.</p>
<p>Help us help the students of Bequia to recognize their dreams, make them into reality and be the very best at whatever they will grow up to be.</p>

<h3>Thanks for Stopping By!</h3>
<p>We are a small group of law students and paralegals who all believe we can use our collective power to eradicate injustice by promoting equal access to and equal treatment within our legal system.</p>
<p>We have helped several families with our own funding, including subsidizing court filing fees, locating volunteer attorneys, providing legal forms and literature, counseling, referrals and much more. In order to expand our services to more states and help those in need, we ask for your valuable assistance in increasing funding. We are requesting statements from former and current clients be posted to Twitter &amp; Facebook. These statements will give you a great idea about the positive impact we have provided to our clients.</p>
<p>Some of the matters we assist with are:</p>
<p>Juvenile Rights, Victims Rights, Veteran Rights, Consumer Rights, Family issues including child support and custody and housing matters.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our team needs funds for transportation, client court fees, clinic location rentals and administrative help.  Every dollar goes a long way. We can run one clinic serving 15 clients for an average of $300 including location, speaker and literature/handouts. $100 can cover a volunteers transportation for 2 weeks, and/or provide low-income clients with 10 individual rides to clinics or meetings.</p>
<p>Our Victims/Survivors Project also accepts donations to assist families of violent crimes with legal and other related support and  referrals.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Why It Matters</h3>
<p>If you have ever tried to obtain help in a legal matter, you know it can be a daunting process especially when income, education, disability or other restrictions pose additional obstacles. Public legal aid centers offer a wealth of assistance, but there are often waiting lists, income and asset restrictions and restrictions on the types of cases they accept.</p>
<p>We also recognize the sacrifice of firms and individuals offering pro bono services to low-income citizens, but depending on a clients location, these services are limited and there are simply not enough professionals able to support the needs of the community. We ensure that every individual eligible for our services receives high quality assistance and representation regardless of socio-economic status, gender, religion, age, ethnic background or sexual orientation.</p>
<p> </p>

We are a small group of law students and paralegals who all believe we can use our collective power to eradicate injustice by promoting equal access to and equal treatment within our legal system.
We have helped several families with our own funding, including subsidizing court filing fees, locating volunteer attorneys, providing legal forms and literature, counseling, referrals and much more. In order to expand our services to more states and help those in need, we ask for your valuable assistance in increasing funding. We are requesting statements from former and current clients be posted to Twitter & Facebook. These statements will give you a great idea about the positive impact we have provided to our clients.
Some of the matters we assist with are:
Juvenile Rights, Victims Rights, Veteran Rights, Consumer Rights, Family issues including child support and custody and housing matters.


What We Need & What You Get
Our team needs funds for transportation, client court fees, clinic location rentals and administrative help.  Every dollar goes a long way. We can run one clinic serving 15 clients for an average of $300 including location, speaker and literature/handouts. $100 can cover a volunteers transportation for 2 weeks, and/or provide low-income clients with 10 individual rides to clinics or meetings.
Our Victims/Survivors Project also accepts donations to assist families of violent crimes with legal and other related support and  referrals.


Why It Matters
If you have ever tried to obtain help in a legal matter, you know it can be a daunting process especially when income, education, disability or other restrictions pose additional obstacles. Public legal aid centers offer a wealth of assistance, but there are often waiting lists, income and asset restrictions and restrictions on the types of cases they accept.
We also recognize the sacrifice of firms and individuals offering pro bono services to low-income citizens, but depending on a clients location, these services are limited and there are simply not enough professionals able to support the needs of the community. We ensure that every individual eligible for our services receives high quality assistance and representation regardless of socio-economic status, gender, religion, age, ethnic background or sexual orientation.

<p>My name is Coach K. I am the Director of Royal Basketball Academy (RBA). RBA is a youth organization that uses basketball as a tool for character development. Now in our second year, RBA is expanding from one team in one school to eight teams in three schools located in Harlem, the Bronx, and Queens. Our programming includes basketball fundamentals, academic enrichment, homework help, character development workshops, and community service projects. RBA's programming is especially designed to serve NYC's young inner-city boys. </p>

<h3 style=""color: #003399;"">RBA suddenly had our funding cut . . .</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, RBA recently had our funding cut. This is an all too familiar scenario in education and youth development organizations. Funding now, during this critical juncture can help RBA not only continue funding this year, but can help bridge us to sustainability.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Through our program this year, RBA is providing programming for 96 young people and part-time employment for six coaches. RBA's contributions are critical for the young people we serve. Our anger management programming helps create safe school communities. Our homework help programming helps create a culture of homework completion. Our community service projects help create a culture of giving back. Most importantly, RBA develops mentorship relationships and an intergenerational mentorship community.</p>

<p>RBA already has receives funding from several sources. Our partnership schools make significant contributions. We receive small monetary donation from local businesses and a small grant from a foundation. Although our program is provided at no cost to parents, RBA will also receive funding from parents and the school community through innovative fundraising programs.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>With all of these funding sources pitching in, we are still short of our budget. Your contributions will help bridge the gap towards sustainability. RBA's work is more in-depth than many youth organizations. We are creating mentorship relationships with young people as a much-needed level of accountability. You are donating to New York City's young people being able to say, ""That's My Coach,"" and it mean more than just basketball. Within RBA, Coach means someone who participates in workshops and community service projects, someone who can speak to your parents and advocate on your behalf, someone who pushes you to be excellent both on and off the court.</p>

<p>Specifically, your donations will go to basketball equipment, league fees, educational supplies, basic media equipment (for youth who participate on our media team), travel expenses, stipends for coaches, and healthy snacks.</p>

<h3></h3>
</div><h3>Short Summary</h3><p>We are a group of concerned parents that have joined forces with the Ashkenazi community in Mexico City to provide kindergarten education and after-school programs to help reverse the trend of jewish discontinuity, which is especially present among Ashkenazi Jews in Mexico.</p><p><br/>After most Mexican Jews left the downtown area of Mexico City to find more space in the suburbs, all the Jewish education centers moved there with them, leaving the downtown area unattended. Recently, there's been a trend to move back to the urban areas, both to reduce our cost of living and  to lead a more urban lifestyle.<br/><br/>All the Jewish families that live in this area don't have access to Jewish education unless they put their children on a hour-long bus ride. Having access to a Jewish kindertgarten provides the roots and foundation towards leading a Jewish younghood and adulthood. Our long-term goal is to provide high-quality services for this neighborhood to be a viable option for jews to return to in order to revive and strengthen this jewish community!</p><p>We have successfully culminated our first school  year at the Gan thanks to the help of our many incredible donors during our <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/campaigns/gan-condesa-continuing-judaism-in-downtown-mexico-city"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">previous campaign</a>  and went from having 4  to 10 students and we are expecting at least 8 more to join before the end of the current school year. </p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p>We finished building the school last summer, we were able to purchase all the initial material for all ages  thanks to all our incredibly generous donors and the continued support of the Ashkenazi Community in Mexico City, to whom we are eternally grateful. This year we will become self-sustainable and we are asking for your help to raise scholarship funds and to make some needed safety and security enhancements on the space. <br/> <br/><br/>Your contribution will help us:</p><ul>
<li>Create a scholarship fund to help the children of needed jewish families at our neighborhood have a jewish education at our Gan</li>
<li>Install a retractible roof to guard the play area against sun and rain</li>
<li>Change the Gan's entrance doors - since the ones that were there originally were built to be safe enough to guard children.  </li>
<li>Continue adding material for the school's library</li>
</ul><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;"">The Impact</span><br/></p><h3>We know of at least 70 young jewish families which are living in the downtown area of Mexico City. Most of which end up moving back to the suburbs due to lack of jewish educational centers downtown. Moving to the suburbs means having a higher cost of living and giving up on the urban lifestyle which we want our kids to grow up in including having access to public parks and recreation centers, playing outside, knowing all kinds of people, experiencing social and environmental responsibility first-hand, among others.</h3><p><br/>Like the old saying goes “build it and they will come” we strongly believe that once these educational services will help bring a return to judaism among the families that are and will live here, strengthening the community and moving it away from discontinuity of our religion.<br/><br/>This educational center has the following services:</p><ul>
<li>Regular kindergarten education for children from 1-6 years of age.</li>
<ul>
<li>Our education is montessori  - allowing children to explore and use their initiative and natural abilities to learn through practical play.<br/>
</li>
<li>We motivate our kids to grow independent and curious minds</li>
<li>We build the identity of our children with both jewish and mexican traditions</li>
</ul>
<li>Extended hours to help working parents from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m.</li>
<li>After-school classes (art, music, dance, early stimulation)</li>

Recently, there's been a trend to move back to the urban areas, both to reduce our cost of living and  to lead a more urban lifestyle.All the Jewish families that live in this area don't have access to Jewish education unless they put their children on a hour-long bus ride. Having access to a Jewish kindertgarten provides the roots and foundation towards leading a Jewish younghood and adulthood. Our long-term goal is to provide high-quality services for this neighborhood to be a viable option for jews to return to in order to revive and strengthen this jewish community!We have successfully culminated our first school  year at the Gan thanks to the help of our many incredible donors during our previous campaign  and went from having 4  to 10 students and we are expecting at least 8 more to join before the end of the current school year. What We Need & What You GetWe finished building the school last summer, we were able to purchase all the initial material for all ages  thanks to all our incredibly generous donors and the continued support of the Ashkenazi Community in Mexico City, to whom we are eternally grateful. This year we will become self-sustainable and we are asking for your help to raise scholarship funds and to make some needed safety and security enhancements on the space.  Your contribution will help us:
Create a scholarship fund to help the children of needed jewish families at our neighborhood have a jewish education at our Gan
Install a retractible roof to guard the play area against sun and rain
Change the Gan's entrance doors - since the ones that were there originally were built to be safe enough to guard children.  
Continue adding material for the school's library
The ImpactWe know of at least 70 young jewish families which are living in the downtown area of Mexico City. Most of which end up moving back to the suburbs due to lack of jewish educational centers downtown. Moving to the suburbs means having a higher cost of living and giving up on the urban lifestyle which we want our kids to grow up in including having access to public parks and recreation centers, playing outside, knowing all kinds of people, experiencing social and environmental responsibility first-hand, among others.Like the old saying goes “build it and they will come” we strongly believe that once these educational services will help bring a return to judaism among the families that are and will live here, strengthening the community and moving it away from discontinuity of our religion.This educational center has the following services:
Regular kindergarten education for children from 1-6 years of age.

Our education is montessori  - allowing children to explore and use their initiative and natural abilities to learn through practical play.

We motivate our kids to grow independent and curious minds
We build the identity of our children with both jewish and mexican traditions

Extended hours to help working parents from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m.
After-school classes (art, music, dance, early stimulation)
Free afterschool hebrew and judaism classes and family activities
Judaism and child-rearing educational seminars for parents
Other Ways You Can HelpWe are looking for contributions in-kind as well, if you know where we can get lightly-used material, books, furniture, etc. we will be forever in debt.You can also contribute by sharing this with everyone you knowFinally, if you live in Mexico City and are interested in working with us full time or want to volunteer to teach one of the after-school programs please contact us.To read more about our program please visit www.gancondesa.comThank you very much!",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

The research team of the Brain Balance Centers is grounded in decades of
published research by renowned scientists and professionals from around the
world. The program instituted are the most comprehensive approach to overcoming
the symptoms of ADHD, learning disabilities, processing disorders, Asperger
syndrome, and a host of other related childhood learning and developmental
issues. The approach of the center would be to utilize an integrated cutting
edge approach that combines three core modalities into one program. This
has been proven to lead to the most effective, lasting results while saving
time and minimizing stress for a parent and a child. After the results of a
child’s individualized assessment, a program tailored specifically to the
child’s unique needs will be created that will eventually play an important
role in improving a child’s ability to learn and behave at an age-appropriate

<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>I am the grandfather of 4, a college
graduate, veteran, and business owner.  My
business failed and I find myself living solely on social security.  More
than 15 years ago, I wrote what I consider to be a classic children's
story.  It is the definitive alphabet story which promotes literacy
by encouraging children's personal love for letters and numbers.  The story is titled, THE A's WERE FIRST TO GO. </p>
<p>The
thing I like most and that for which I am most proud, is that it is a clever story which does not talk down to children.  The
story is quite unique when compared to typical children's books.  For one example, it is more than 30 pages long.  We take a simple concept and let it progress to its  logical (?? :-) conclusion.  This particular journey requires 3 chapters and more than 30 pages to get the conclusion.  Happily,  children love the long adventure.  </p>
<p>This whimsical, humorous story is about
the time when all the letters and numbers left.  It is a mystery. 
No one knew where they had gone or why the left.<span>  The story is great for very young child
(ages 4 to 6) who love to have a parent or grandparent read to
them.  It is also great for those a little older (ages 6 to 9) who like
to read for themselves.   </span></p>
<p>Teacher, librarians, parents, grandparents,
and small children love the story. Everyone encouraged me to get the story
published.  Therefore, I ventured forth - as I am sure you
would have.  Unfortunately, it is almost impossible for one who is not
published to become one who is published.  Over the years I accumulated
many, many rejection letters from traditional publishers.</p>
<p>I tried as hard and as often as I could
to get published.  Against the advice of 'experts', I even spent more than
$5000 for rough, black and white illustrations that attempt to graphically convey the
whimsy and humor in the story.<span>  I
hoped the draft illustrations would improve my chances of getting
published.  It didn’t work. </span></p>
<p><span>Please go to our 'Gallery' tab - above- to get a little flavor of the story.</span></p>
<p>I have not given up on the story but I have
given up on the hope of finding a traditional publisher to put it
together.  The time is late for me and I realize my only recourse is to
self-publish, but the cost is more than I can handle today.</p>
<p>If I had the resources, the first thing
I would do is refine and colorize the illustrations and the cover.  Obviously, they are in rough draft form and need to be upgraded.  This alone would cost several thousand dollars.  Then I would have a vanity publisher put
the book together.  I would then buy as many of the finished books as
finances allow and embark on a marketing and promotional
program.  </p>
<p>The program would include attending book fairs, sending copies to
buyers across the country who purchase for county-wide school library
systems, picking the brains of other self-publishers who found success,
reading to children in libraries and book stores, etc.,
etc., etc.  My goal would be to demonstrate the value and popularity of
the book, in the hope that a traditional publisher would pick it up and make it
readily available to every child, parent, and grandparent in the country.</p>
<p>Actively doing something tangible that
encourages thousands of children to love letters and number is a noble
endeavor, one that can provide satisfaction almost beyond description.<span>  As the author of a book that can inspire thousands
of children to have a greater regard for literacy, I can honestly say my dream will
not happen without your help.  This is an
opportunity for you, personally, to partake in that noble endeavor and make it
partly your dream too.  </span></p>
<p><span></span><span>If you know others who might want to help bring about a quality children's book that promotes literacy, either for their own families, or for all children in general, please refer them to this campaign.</span></p>
<p>Please contribute whatever you can. </p>

story.  It is the definitive alphabet story which promotes literacy
by encouraging children's personal love for letters and numbers.  The story is titled, THE A's WERE FIRST TO GO. 
The
thing I like most and that for which I am most proud, is that it is a clever story which does not talk down to children.  The
story is quite unique when compared to typical children's books.  For one example, it is more than 30 pages long.  We take a simple concept and let it progress to its  logical (?? :-) conclusion.  This particular journey requires 3 chapters and more than 30 pages to get the conclusion.  Happily,  children love the long adventure.  
This whimsical, humorous story is about
the time when all the letters and numbers left.  It is a mystery. 
No one knew where they had gone or why the left.  The story is great for very young child
(ages 4 to 6) who love to have a parent or grandparent read to
them.  It is also great for those a little older (ages 6 to 9) who like
to read for themselves.   
Teacher, librarians, parents, grandparents,
and small children love the story. Everyone encouraged me to get the story
published.  Therefore, I ventured forth - as I am sure you
would have.  Unfortunately, it is almost impossible for one who is not
published to become one who is published.  Over the years I accumulated
many, many rejection letters from traditional publishers.
I tried as hard and as often as I could
to get published.  Against the advice of 'experts', I even spent more than
$5000 for rough, black and white illustrations that attempt to graphically convey the
whimsy and humor in the story.  I
hoped the draft illustrations would improve my chances of getting
published.  It didn’t work. 
Please go to our 'Gallery' tab - above- to get a little flavor of the story.
I have not given up on the story but I have
given up on the hope of finding a traditional publisher to put it
together.  The time is late for me and I realize my only recourse is to
self-publish, but the cost is more than I can handle today.
If I had the resources, the first thing
I would do is refine and colorize the illustrations and the cover.  Obviously, they are in rough draft form and need to be upgraded.  This alone would cost several thousand dollars.  Then I would have a vanity publisher put
the book together.  I would then buy as many of the finished books as
finances allow and embark on a marketing and promotional
program.  
The program would include attending book fairs, sending copies to
buyers across the country who purchase for county-wide school library
systems, picking the brains of other self-publishers who found success,
reading to children in libraries and book stores, etc.,
etc., etc.  My goal would be to demonstrate the value and popularity of
the book, in the hope that a traditional publisher would pick it up and make it
readily available to every child, parent, and grandparent in the country.
Actively doing something tangible that
encourages thousands of children to love letters and number is a noble
endeavor, one that can provide satisfaction almost beyond description.  As the author of a book that can inspire thousands
of children to have a greater regard for literacy, I can honestly say my dream will
not happen without your help.  This is an
opportunity for you, personally, to partake in that noble endeavor and make it
partly your dream too.  
If you know others who might want to help bring about a quality children's book that promotes literacy, either for their own families, or for all children in general, please refer them to this campaign.
Please contribute whatever you can.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Since 1995, my fieldwork is Bororo culture  at Meruri and Garças villages (Mato Grosso, Brazil). José Carlos Kuguri, the

to collect funds towards the realization of the most important

<p>
</p>
<p>The ritual of the funeral
is connected to their philosophy, according to which the <i>master of son</i>gs plays a central role through the whole process. The
ritual begins with the inhumation of the body of the deceased, followed by
his/her exhumation and the transfiguration of his/her skull and bones into an
ancestral being (<i>arara</i>). The body of José Carlos was already buried at
the center of his <i>aldeia</i> (Garças) at the end of this June. Since then,
his body has been watered everyday to facilitate putrefaction until his
exhumation, which should take place at the beginning of this October. By then,
the most important phase of the Bororo ritual will take place.</p>



Donations may favor the realization not only of the funeral, but of the <b>self-representation project</b>: Beyond the Salesians, Fazendeiros or Rede Globo
influences, Bororo culture must survive. The realization of this
funeral is crucial to the Bororo people in that it enables them to reproduce
their political stance in the world through their practices of autonomous self-representation.
As such, it is part and parcel of contemporary human heritage, hence important
to everybody else living everywhere in the world. <p>I'd like to receive 2.500 US$: it is necessary to fund expenses concerning the arrival and stay of
other masters of songs and the participation of other Bororo representatives from several other <i>aldeias</i>
in Mato Grosso, who will be also in charge of nominating a successor to José
Carlos.  <br/></p>

the most important phase of the Bororo ritual will take place.



Donations may favor the realization not only of the funeral, but of the self-representation project: Beyond the Salesians, Fazendeiros or Rede Globo
influences, Bororo culture must survive. The realization of this
funeral is crucial to the Bororo people in that it enables them to reproduce
their political stance in the world through their practices of autonomous self-representation.
As such, it is part and parcel of contemporary human heritage, hence important
to everybody else living everywhere in the world. I'd like to receive 2.500 US$: it is necessary to fund expenses concerning the arrival and stay of
other masters of songs and the participation of other Bororo representatives from several other aldeias
in Mato Grosso, who will be also in charge of nominating a successor to José
Carlos.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

</h3>Harriet Tubman Democratic High School is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit school serving mostly low-income families in and around Albany, NY. Harriet Tubman enrolls many students
who were drop-outs or considered at-risk, and offers a safe and diverse community for all youth. We
receive no public funds and have always run on the principle that all youth deserve equal educational  opportunities —  no one has ever been turned away based on economic considerations.  Over half of our students have always received scholarships. For the past three school years,<i> over 90% of our students received significant tuition assistance, <b>with over 70% qualifying for full tuition coverage</b></i>. This is why we are turning to you for help. <p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1078512/files/20141207144239-Class.JPG?1417992159"" src="""" style=""width: 317.614px;height: 195px;""/> <img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p>Students need our services, but we are struggling to provide them because we lack the funding. Every year our students, staff, parents, board, and volunteers work hard
 to raise the money needed to sponsor every child-in-need. We are 
halfway through the school year and must raise an additional $21,000 by 
July 1, 2015. The $5,000 goal of this Indiegogo campaign will allow us
 to reach our incremental goal this quarter. <br/>

They committed their time to building a trusting relationship with him, and provided the mentorship and individual instruction he needed.<span>  Through the safe and supportive community of Harriet Tubman, Sakeem was empowered to open up and find the confidence to make the major changes he wanted in his life. After spending only one year at Harriet Tubman, Sakeem passed his first high school state assessment test – ever – an exciting personal accomplishment. Now, after voluntarily spending two of his summers on school work, Sakeem is on track to graduate this spring.</span>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Your contribution towards our Student Support Fund, and your help in 
sharing this campaign, will provide support to cover costs to which most
 of our
student families cannot contribute. We strive to  create a learning environment that meets every child’s needs, and<i> your support will help make that possible</i>.</p>
<p>While large donations are helpful, a great number of small donations will also get us to our goal — every bit helps!</p>
<p>If you are unable to make a contribution at this time, please consider helping us spread the word to other potential donors. Greater recognition for our campaign will go a long way to helping us reach out goal! <br/></p>
<h3>Challenges</h3> <p>Harriet Tubman does not receive any government funding. Yet with the growing number of
 students coming to us from
low-income families, our revenue balance has shifted dramatically away 
from
tuition-paying students. We require support from individuals in the 
wider community if the school is to continue to serve this population by
helping them graduate high school. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1078504/files/20141207143625-IMG_2930_-_Revised.JPG?1417991785"" src="""" style=""width: 366.811px;height: 130px;cursor: nw-resize;""/></p>Nationwide, people are realizing that there are many children who simply cannot learn in traditional schools. This is particularly true for students from low-income families who cannot afford to pay for the individual extra help of a tutor or small classrooms in a private school. The drop-out rate is alarmingly high, especially for low-income students of color. Equal access to all educational opportunities is beneficial to our entire community, as it allows our youth to support themselves through better employment and encourages them to make other positive life choices.<br/>

<p>Our experience tells us that many children need small, community-based schools such as Harriet Tubman Democratic High School. For those who want to encourage the movement of non-traditional schools, or democratic education in particular, consider the power of helping Harriet Tubman demonstrate how alternative educational philosophies provide quality education to every child, from all walks of life. <br/></p>

Harriet Tubman Democratic High School is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit school serving mostly low-income families in and around Albany, NY. Harriet Tubman enrolls many students
who were drop-outs or considered at-risk, and offers a safe and diverse community for all youth. We
receive no public funds and have always run on the principle that all youth deserve equal educational  opportunities —  no one has ever been turned away based on economic considerations.  Over half of our students have always received scholarships. For the past three school years, over 90% of our students received significant tuition assistance, with over 70% qualifying for full tuition coverage. This is why we are turning to you for help.  Students need our services, but we are struggling to provide them because we lack the funding. Every year our students, staff, parents, board, and volunteers work hard
 to raise the money needed to sponsor every child-in-need. We are 
halfway through the school year and must raise an additional $21,000 by 
July 1, 2015. The $5,000 goal of this Indiegogo campaign will allow us
 to reach our incremental goal this quarter. 

You Can Help These Children GraduateWith your support, we can continue to serve children in desperate need of our help. 79% of Harriet Tubman graduates have gone on to attend college or career training programs and 97% have been successful there. The unique philosophy of the Harriet Tubman program allows us to meet the particular challenges children face and helps them earn a high school diploma.Over eight years ago, Harriet Tubman Democratic High School opened its doors to offer students a learning environment that responds to the unique needs of each child. Our student-centered school engages every child in their own learning process with the guidance and support of teachers dedicated to their academic and personal development. Visit here for a detailed presentation of our program.



You Will be Helping Children Like...

Sakeem first came to Harriet Tubman as a 17 year old 9th grader, having dropped out after failing multiple times. Sakeem was extremely self-conscious about his age and lacked the confidence needed to succeed academically. His common  refrain: “I can’t do it.” 



  Yet Sakeem had a passionate desire to earn his high school diploma, and the staff recognized this. They committed their time to building a trusting relationship with him, and provided the mentorship and individual instruction he needed.  Through the safe and supportive community of Harriet Tubman, Sakeem was empowered to open up and find the confidence to make the major changes he wanted in his life. After spending only one year at Harriet Tubman, Sakeem passed his first high school state assessment test – ever – an exciting personal accomplishment. Now, after voluntarily spending two of his summers on school work, Sakeem is on track to graduate this spring.
 

Other Ways You Can Help
Your contribution towards our Student Support Fund, and your help in 
sharing this campaign, will provide support to cover costs to which most
 of our
student families cannot contribute. We strive to  create a learning environment that meets every child’s needs, and your support will help make that possible.
While large donations are helpful, a great number of small donations will also get us to our goal — every bit helps!
If you are unable to make a contribution at this time, please consider helping us spread the word to other potential donors. Greater recognition for our campaign will go a long way to helping us reach out goal! 
Challenges Harriet Tubman does not receive any government funding. Yet with the growing number of
 students coming to us from
low-income families, our revenue balance has shifted dramatically away 
from
tuition-paying students. We require support from individuals in the 
wider community if the school is to continue to serve this population by
helping them graduate high school. 


Nationwide, people are realizing that there are many children who simply cannot learn in traditional schools. This is particularly true for students from low-income families who cannot afford to pay for the individual extra help of a tutor or small classrooms in a private school. The drop-out rate is alarmingly high, especially for low-income students of color. Equal access to all educational opportunities is beneficial to our entire community, as it allows our youth to support themselves through better employment and encourages them to make other positive life choices.

 
Our experience tells us that many children need small, community-based schools such as Harriet Tubman Democratic High School. For those who want to encourage the movement of non-traditional schools, or democratic education in particular, consider the power of helping Harriet Tubman demonstrate how alternative educational philosophies provide quality education to every child, from all walks of life.",9.0,0,"3 Campaigns

These projects, run out of Ratbu's tiny classroom, have helped students grow into community leaders,  shown teachers how to create fun and research-driven lessons, and given kids with disabilities the chance to show their community all the amazing things they CAN do.  This room has become an indispensable resource to the people of Ratbu's village.    What We Need  But now we need your help.  Ratbu's room and work have been growing steadily, and last year she moved her little room into a slightly bigger room that will be a more permanent headquarters and can accommodate the growing numbers of people that want to work with her on her projects.  The room (which will be the first wheelchair-accessible place in town) is almost ready to go, but needs a few final improvements before Ratbu can host workshops there.  So here's what we need: Water:  $1,900We plan to serve people with physical disabilities who often cannot carry buckets of water or use outdoor toilets without assistance.  Indoor plumbing will help this group feel much more comfortable in our classroom.Heat:  $1,200Kyrgyzstan winters are on par with Vermont winters, but buildings in Kyrgyzstan do not come automatically wired with heat.  Many households heat only one small room with an electric heater, and in many classrooms, children simply leave their winter coats on in their classrooms.  Since Ratbu's workshops sometimes need to accommodate more than 30 people, small electric heaters are simply not adequate, and radiator heat throughout the building is necessary.
Wheelchair Ramp:  $300
Many children stay home from school simply because their wheelchairs cannot fit through the doors to their school.  With help from this project, Ratbu's classroom will be the first building in town where kids bound to a wheelchair can come right up to the front door without any barriers.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Hello! My name is Mara Magyarosi and I'm bringing the One Million Bones project to Henry Ford Academy: School for Creative Studies. We are holding a three day event on November 9-11 filled with activities surrounding this project. </p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;"">A little background: </p>
<p>The One Million Bones project was created by Naomi Natale, and you can find all sorts of information about it at onemillionbones.org. The basic idea behind it is that one million people each create one bone to represent one person who has been killed by genocide. These bones, created from clay in this particular case, will be laid out in the National Mall in Washington DC in 2013 as a mass grave. <br/></p>
<p>College for Creative Studies brought the One Million Bones project to freshman year orientation this year. As a teaching assistant, I had the opportunity to participate with the students on an educational level - discussing what this project means and how art activism can affect a community. We were the largest group of people to ever do this project at the same time before, and this is something that stuck in my mind.</p>
<p>Henry Ford Academy: School for Creative Studies is the partner middle and high school that housed at the same location as College for Creative Studies. As a duel major in photography and art education, I have wanted to find a way to bring a community art project to the entire high school, and this project was the perfect opportunity. We will once again knock out of the park the amount of people participating on the project at one time by almost 75 people, which will put not only our schools' combined partnership on the national map, but Detroit as well. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>As artists, it is our responsibility to not only make a difference to the world, but to educate others on how to as well. By contributing to this campaign, you will be helping us fund the supplies for the entire high school to be able to participate!<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This campaign is already having a national impact. By simply having the conversation about what we are willing to accept about the treatment of people on the high school level, tolerance and equality can be spread early. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>There also is the smaller impact that the students at Henry Ford Academy: School for Creative Studies do not currently have clay in any part of their curriculum, so by having this project, we are introducing an entire possible medium to all of the students. This can open up possibilities for them for a lifetime.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The basics of what we need are supplies! Any funding that you can contribute will greatly help us in our goal of funding this incredible project. <br/></p>
<p>The breakdown:</p>
<p>$300 = Clay for the bones</p>
<p>$300 = Paper to cover the tables in the classrooms</p>
<p>$100 = Tarps to cover the gymnasium floor during the installation</p>
<p>$100 = Pizza boxes to carry the bones in after the installation</p>

</div><p></p><h3>Who Are We?</h3><p>Crocus Academy Main Street is a quality preschool and prekindergarten program located in the heart of Bardstown. We offer a Bible based curriculum that includes an emphasis on all the core content areas required for a quality early childhood education. Crocus Academy opened in Bardstown in 2003, and we opened our second location in Elizabethtown in 2009. Our goal is to prepare young children socially, academically and spiritually for kindergarten without sacrificing the joy, wonder and curiosity of learning.</p><p>Every year we send out fundraiser packets to all our families in hopes of earning about $100.00 per student.  We have sold poinsettias, coffee, evergreen products and many other ""big hits"", but let's face it, no one likes to hit up their neighbors to buy something they really do not need.  Some of our families are new to the area or not from the area, and it is even harder to ask a stranger to support your child's school.  There is no fun in fundraising!</p><p>This year we are trying something a little different, but we need your support.  Each year we have several special needs that require funds that cannot be covered by tuition alone.  Your donation will help Crocus Academy Main Street and Crocus Academy Heartland support children and their families throughout this school year, events and activities that cannot be accomplished without your assistance.</p><p>I love our families and our staff, and every day I feel blessed to go to work, and I know they feel the same.  Ms. Karen, at a staff meeting today told me, ""I can't wait to come to work on Monday!""  I have no words to express what that means, but I am pretty sure that it means that God is blessing our endeavors.</p><p>If you have a child or know a child who has ever attended Crocus Academy Main Street or Crocus Academy Heartland, then you know how wonderful our schools are, and how dedicated we are to providing the best start for young children.  Please take a moment to show your support.  Every donation will be used to provide for amazing experiences and needed opportunities for young children.</p><p></p><h3>What Do We Need?</h3><p>We try to make children feel special, and each year we have very specific needs for projects, events and celebrations that go beyond tuition.  Here are just a few, and I have tried to break down the approximate cost of each based upon last year's numbers.</p><ul>
<li><b>Fall Festival and Thanksgiving Celebration for Each Center ($500.00)</b></li>
<li><b>Christmas Gift Books for Each Child ($200.00)</b></li>
<li><b>Donuts for Dads ($100-$200)</b></li>
<li><b>Muffins with Moms ($100-$200)</b></li>
<li><b>Graduation and Promotion Events ($300.00)</b></li>
<li><b>CCAP Co-Pay Assistance ($500.00)</b></li>
<li><b>Tuition Discounts for Military (10% Non-Deployed Active Duty and 25% Deployed Active Duty) </b></li>
<li><b>Staff Appreciation during Child Care Provider Appreciation Week ($50-$100 per staff member)</b></li>
<li><b>Upgrades in Equipment:  This one is special.  This year we would like to make iPad labs in both centers with six iPads per center.  Obviously this is a big one, but we might as well plan for success. :)</b></li>
</ul><br/><h3>What Makes Us Special?</h3><br/><p>Our schools are really wonderful and reflect our commitment to excellence and our dedicated staff and supportive families.  Here are a few things that make us unique.</p><ul>
<li><b>6:1 Student to Staff Ratio for Preschool Classes</b></li>
<li><b><b>8:1 Student to Staff Ratio for Prekindergarten Classes</b></b></li>
<li><b><b>Bible Centered Weekly Themes</b></b></li>

</div><p></p></div>","Who Are We?Crocus Academy Main Street is a quality preschool and prekindergarten program located in the heart of Bardstown. We offer a Bible based curriculum that includes an emphasis on all the core content areas required for a quality early childhood education. Crocus Academy opened in Bardstown in 2003, and we opened our second location in Elizabethtown in 2009. Our goal is to prepare young children socially, academically and spiritually for kindergarten without sacrificing the joy, wonder and curiosity of learning.Every year we send out fundraiser packets to all our families in hopes of earning about $100.00 per student.  We have sold poinsettias, coffee, evergreen products and many other ""big hits"", but let's face it, no one likes to hit up their neighbors to buy something they really do not need.  Some of our families are new to the area or not from the area, and it is even harder to ask a stranger to support your child's school.  There is no fun in fundraising!This year we are trying something a little different, but we need your support.  Each year we have several special needs that require funds that cannot be covered by tuition alone.  Your donation will help Crocus Academy Main Street and Crocus Academy Heartland support children and their families throughout this school year, events and activities that cannot be accomplished without your assistance.I love our families and our staff, and every day I feel blessed to go to work, and I know they feel the same.  Ms. Karen, at a staff meeting today told me, ""I can't wait to come to work on Monday!""  I have no words to express what that means, but I am pretty sure that it means that God is blessing our endeavors.If you have a child or know a child who has ever attended Crocus Academy Main Street or Crocus Academy Heartland, then you know how wonderful our schools are, and how dedicated we are to providing the best start for young children.  Please take a moment to show your support.  Every donation will be used to provide for amazing experiences and needed opportunities for young children.What Do We Need?We try to make children feel special, and each year we have very specific needs for projects, events and celebrations that go beyond tuition.  Here are just a few, and I have tried to break down the approximate cost of each based upon last year's numbers.
Fall Festival and Thanksgiving Celebration for Each Center ($500.00)
Christmas Gift Books for Each Child ($200.00)
Donuts for Dads ($100-$200)
Muffins with Moms ($100-$200)
Graduation and Promotion Events ($300.00)
CCAP Co-Pay Assistance ($500.00)
Tuition Discounts for Military (10% Non-Deployed Active Duty and 25% Deployed Active Duty) 
Staff Appreciation during Child Care Provider Appreciation Week ($50-$100 per staff member)
Upgrades in Equipment:  This one is special.  This year we would like to make iPad labs in both centers with six iPads per center.  Obviously this is a big one, but we might as well plan for success. :)
What Makes Us Special?Our schools are really wonderful and reflect our commitment to excellence and our dedicated staff and supportive families.  Here are a few things that make us unique.
6:1 Student to Staff Ratio for Preschool Classes
8:1 Student to Staff Ratio for Prekindergarten Classes
Bible Centered Weekly Themes
Comprehensive Curriculum that Addresses Core Content Areas like Language and Literacy; Science and Discovery; Block Play; Dramatic Play; Creative Expression; Music and Movement; Fine Motor and Sensory Activities; Gross Motor Activities; Self Help Skills, Social and Emotional Development and Screening and Assessment Educated and Experienced Teachers with Degrees that Include Associates in Interdisciplinary Early Childhood Education, Bachelors in IECE, Child Development Associates Degree, Commonwealth Child Care Credential, Director Credential, Training Credential, and more

<p><b>WORKx SUMMARY</b></p>
<p>We are WORKx and we are determined
to help all Citizens of the United States of America to find work, a job,
and/or a career.<span>  This campaign is
dedicated to my father, “John Buster “Buck” Sizemore.  I started on my personal journey to help
people to get a job when I met a gentleman who was having difficulty.</span></p>
<p>“George”, as I will call him, came
up to me to ask if I could help him with a few dollars.<span>  I could tell by his embarrassment that he was
ashamed to ask for money and that he was truly desperate.  I took out some money for him, but before I
gave it to him, I asked him why he needed it.</span></p>
<p>He had left his home in Macon,
Georgia to seek employment here in the Atlanta, Georgia area.<span>  With a sense of dread, I asked him how he was
seeking employment, although I had an instinctive sense of what he was about to
say.</span></p>
<p>He said that he was checking the
newspaper want ads and signed up at several work agencies, and went to the
Department of Labor.<span>  I asked if he used
the internet or even had an email address. 
He did not and had never considered it important.  I referred him to a nearby Dekalb County
Services Office that provided basic computer skills and resume writing
services, but I knew he needed much more than that.</span></p>
<p><b><u>MISSION</u></b></p>
<p>Our mission is to educate anyone who
is technology challenged in finding work, a job, or bettering their career due
to underemployment.<span>  There will be online
resources for anyone needing them, so everyone can get assistance. There are
many ways to learn technology, but people are not taught how to effectively
utilize it in the workforce.  We will
change that.</span></p>
<p>Technology is changing on a near
daily basis and traditional institutions cannot keep up, such Technology
training must be “Agile”.<span>  Agile is being
able to break large problems in to smaller tasks that can be solved using
current technologies in a short period of time. 
Anyone that is seeking work must become “Agile”.</span></p>
<p><b><u>What We Need &amp; What You Get</u></b></p>
<p>WORKx is a dedicated effort to
directly create local training centers, assist in supporting tele-presence
capabilities, create and manage online Learning Management System (LMS),
organize/connect LTCs into a National Training Center (NTC), and coordinate
efforts with government, corporations, and Non-Profit Organizations (NPO).<span>  </span></p>
<p>Our apologies for the “Techno
Speech”, but not to worry.<span>  We can teach
you how to use these abilities.  They
will greatly increase anyone’s use of technology and how to use it on the job
or running your own business.</span></p>
<p><b><u>Risks &amp; Challenges</u></b></p>
<p>Assisting people in learning
technology, primarily computers and smart phones, will greatly increase
people’s quality of life and allow them to truly pursue the American
Dream.<span>  The technology and education part
of WORKx is fairly straight forward and will not be a difficult problem.</span></p>
<p>The big challenge will be in
organizing and assisting individuals as they are using the WORKx system.<span>  We will be using a self-supportive system
that will provide a helpful and responsive support system.</span></p>
<p><b><u>Ways You Can Help</u></b></p>
<p>To eradicate unemployment and to
create work and jobs will literally be a project that will never end.<span>  It will require everyone to help in whatever
way they can.  If you have vast
resources, such as Bill Gates or Warren Buffett, you can help in a very large
way.  If you are out of work and
concerned where your next meal will come from, then you can’t assist with
money, but you can still help in a profound way.</span></p>
<p>To begin, you need to donate at
least $1.00 to the WORKx IndieGoGo campaign.<span> 
This action exerts a strong connection to the effort.  The first action is Karma, where the positive
and negative intent and actions of an individual influence the future of that
individual. The second action is what
the investors call “Skin in the Game”, to have money at risk by being invested
in achieving a goal.  This creates an
emotional connection with the intended goal.</span></p>
<p>The second action is to tell as many
people as possible about the WORKx program.<span> 
We need people to fund and support the project, as well as actually
using the program.  This means that
everyone needs to be involved.</span></p>
<p>The third action is to be involved
in the WORKx program.<span>  Register with the
national WORKx center and a plan of study will be created.  The following steps will be initiated:</span></p>
<p><span>1.<span> 
</span></span>There will be an initial interview
process to determine your present situation and desired job track.</p>
<p><span>2.<span> 
</span></span>Assess Technology Knowledge Level
(TKL) and assign to TKL support team, if needed*.</p>
<p><span>3.<span> 
</span></span>Assign LMS curriculum and related
courses.</p>
<p><span>4.<span> 
</span></span>Assign a Technology Mentor.</p>
<p><span>5.<span> 
</span></span>Progress will be charted by the LMS
system and reviewed by the assigned mentor and an Education Manager.</p>
<p><span>6.<span> 
</span></span>Education goals will documented and
a certificate or diploma will be presented.<span> 
The WORKx program will explore the possibility that certified training
credits or other types of certifications are available.</span></p>
<p><span>7.<span> 
</span></span>WORKx will provide a follow-up
mentor function to support any continued formal education, work situation, or
career.</p>
<p><b><u>NOT TO WORRY</u></b></p>
<p>I have an extensive career of
teaching computer and technology to a wide and varied group of
individuals.<span>  You must see the video that
showcases some of the more interesting classes I have taught.  One such class was a group of 14 middle aged
women that brought their knitting with them. 
I learned several teaching principles from that group and I didn’t lose
anyone.</span></p>
<p>I have taught thousands of
individuals and I never lost anyone that applied themselves for at least
minutes.<span>  I did lose one person that did
not apply himself for that vital five minutes and you can learn about him in an
upcoming video called, “Oops”.</span></p>
<p><b><u>HOPE, LOVE, CHARITY</u></b></p>
<p>The foundation for WORKx is Hope,
Love, and Charity.<span>  The ability to do anything
begins with Hope.</span></p>
<p>Hope is the essential beginning for
all action.<span>  Hope is the spark that
creates Faith, which in turn creates Action. 
We all have different ways and paths to these actions and I am here to
bring Hope that everyone can learn and use technology.  I, personally, have seen what works and what
does not works.  There is no one way to achieve
the goals of WORKx, it will take a large organized and coordinated effort to do
it.</span></p>
<p>The time to start is now.<span>  The economic news is improving and there will
be a huge increase in the job market, but anyone in the work force must be able
to provide the technology skills needed to do the job.</span></p>
<p><b><u>CONCLUSION</u></b></p>

There are many challenges for WORKx, but we will
bring the people and skills together to solve them.<span>  The 21<sup>st</sup> century is here and we
all need to come together to support each other and help each other.  There is a saying that when the water rises,
all the boats will also rise</span><br/></div>","WORKx SUMMARY

of WORKx is fairly straight forward and will not be a difficult problem.
The big challenge will be in
organizing and assisting individuals as they are using the WORKx system.  We will be using a self-supportive system
that will provide a helpful and responsive support system.
Ways You Can Help
To eradicate unemployment and to
create work and jobs will literally be a project that will never end.  It will require everyone to help in whatever
way they can.  If you have vast
resources, such as Bill Gates or Warren Buffett, you can help in a very large
way.  If you are out of work and
concerned where your next meal will come from, then you can’t assist with
money, but you can still help in a profound way.
To begin, you need to donate at
least $1.00 to the WORKx IndieGoGo campaign. 
This action exerts a strong connection to the effort.  The first action is Karma, where the positive
and negative intent and actions of an individual influence the future of that
individual. The second action is what
the investors call “Skin in the Game”, to have money at risk by being invested
in achieving a goal.  This creates an
emotional connection with the intended goal.
The second action is to tell as many
people as possible about the WORKx program. 
We need people to fund and support the project, as well as actually
using the program.  This means that
everyone needs to be involved.
The third action is to be involved
in the WORKx program.  Register with the
national WORKx center and a plan of study will be created.  The following steps will be initiated:
1. 
There will be an initial interview
process to determine your present situation and desired job track.
2. 
Assess Technology Knowledge Level
(TKL) and assign to TKL support team, if needed*.
3. 
Assign LMS curriculum and related
courses.
4. 
Assign a Technology Mentor.
5. 
Progress will be charted by the LMS
system and reviewed by the assigned mentor and an Education Manager.
6. 
Education goals will documented and
a certificate or diploma will be presented. 
The WORKx program will explore the possibility that certified training
credits or other types of certifications are available.
7. 
WORKx will provide a follow-up
mentor function to support any continued formal education, work situation, or
career.
NOT TO WORRY
I have an extensive career of
teaching computer and technology to a wide and varied group of
individuals.  You must see the video that
showcases some of the more interesting classes I have taught.  One such class was a group of 14 middle aged
women that brought their knitting with them. 
I learned several teaching principles from that group and I didn’t lose
anyone.
I have taught thousands of
individuals and I never lost anyone that applied themselves for at least
minutes.  I did lose one person that did
not apply himself for that vital five minutes and you can learn about him in an
upcoming video called, “Oops”.
HOPE, LOVE, CHARITY
The foundation for WORKx is Hope,
Love, and Charity.  The ability to do anything
begins with Hope.
Hope is the essential beginning for
all action.  Hope is the spark that
creates Faith, which in turn creates Action. 
We all have different ways and paths to these actions and I am here to
bring Hope that everyone can learn and use technology.  I, personally, have seen what works and what
does not works.  There is no one way to achieve
the goals of WORKx, it will take a large organized and coordinated effort to do
it.
The time to start is now.  The economic news is improving and there will
be a huge increase in the job market, but anyone in the work force must be able
to provide the technology skills needed to do the job.
CONCLUSION

There are many challenges for WORKx, but we will
bring the people and skills together to solve them.  The 21st century is here and we
all need to come together to support each other and help each other.  There is a saying that when the water rises,
all the boats will also rise",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Early intervention programs such as Applied Behavioural Analysis (ABA) are highly effective, but setting them up and keeping them running is an overwhelming administrative and logistical task, tacked onto the already stressful job of trying to cope with the odd and sometimes violent or dangerous behaviours of your child, and coordinating information from multiple specialists.ABA early intervention programs by their nature require vast amounts of data to be collected and analysed in order to be effective.

Not really.Using paper or crude electronic means like sending documents by email are cumbersome and actually prevent effective communication among team members. Until they physically come to the home and sift through the binders, team members don't know what they will be working on; BC's don't know how effective their programming is; and parents don't have a clear picture of their child's progress.

Adding more team collaboration features such as time tracking and scheduling
Integrating support for school-based Individualized Education Plans for special needs children.
Creating a user marketplace for practitioners to exchange ideas or buy and sell standardized curricula.
Integrating ABAKiS with other tools such as clickers to make it even easier for practitioners to collect trial data.
Providing anonymized data to support professionals researching the efficacy of different autism treatment methods.
Where Will the Funds Go?Initially our #1 priority for funding will be getting the existing core features out to the market so people can start using ABAKiS to make their lives easier. After a careful selection process we are proud to announce that we will be working with Pernix Solutions, a highly professional, outsourced, Agile-based software engineering team located in Costa Rica. (These guys are rock stars.)Here is the rough order of spending priority for the short term:
Minimum development of core application to public launch

Customer support

Sales and marketing
Expansion of core feature set development to more fully support teams
Part-time directors' pay (eventually we intend to focus on ABAKiS full time)
Usability studies and UX enhancements
How Much Will ABAKiS Cost?Here is a summary of our current estimate for ABAKiS subscription fees. These may change but hopefully not by much. Basic support options will be included.
Single user subscription for evaluation or very small teams:


Free for 14 days, then $49 per month after

Team subscription (typically 5-10 users):

1 month - $99
3 months - $89 per month ($267)
One year - $79 per month ($948)

<p>                           <strong>Summary of CEFopoly</strong>: </p>
<p><strong>What is CEFopoly about? </strong></p>
<p><strong>The Definition of CEFopoly:</strong> a blending of the acronym <strong>CEF</strong> and the attachment phrase “opoly” to connote and imply the feeling of a game that is fun and engaging.</p>
<p>                                    <strong> C</strong> = College</p>
<p>                                     <strong>E</strong> = Education</p>
<p>                                     <strong>F</strong> = Foundation</p>
<p>Essentially CEFopoly is the “<em><strong>gamification</strong></em>” of three important content areas / messages of information about the acquisition of ""formal knowledge"" through: </p>
<p>[1.] The American college &amp; university system,</p>
<p>[2.] Conceptual and introductory information about Intellectual Property, and</p>
<p>[3.] Conceptual and introductory information about Entrepreneurship </p>
<p><strong>CEFopoly</strong> is a game that provides gamers, students, parents, grandparents, educators / teachers, and anyone who is interested in the learning that takes place in games, in a format of fun and interactive engagement.  <strong>CEFopoly</strong> is designed to perk curiosity, engage the brains’ inquisitiveness, all while tantalizing the competitive juices in the game participants.  The winner is the person that at the end of the game has acquired or owns the most knowledge from within the game's subject matter areas.</p>
<p><strong>Who benefits:</strong> </p>
<p>All game players and participants gain while playing CEFopoly.</p>
<p><strong>CEFopoly game players/participants</strong> learn while playing the game about twenty-two (22) varying major areas and courses of study from within the American college and university system. </p>
<p><strong>CEFopoly game players/participants</strong> also are provided through the two stacks of cards that are apart of the games operating rules information about common experiences and organizational situations in college, acquiring and creating intellectual property, and entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>One card stack is called:   ""<strong>College Knowledge</strong>""</p>
<p>One card stack is called:    ""<strong>Risk Or Reward</strong>""</p>
<p>This stack has interspersed information about the benefits of intellectual property, and while playing introduces the players to concepts within the area of Intellectual Property  (aka IP).  Additionally, the stack has cards in it that introduces the player/participants to the elements of entrepreneurship. </p>
<p><strong>CEFopoly </strong>game players/participants learn about the four major academic degrees:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Associate of Arts</strong></li>
<li><strong>Baccalaureate </strong></li>
<li><strong>Masters</strong></li>
<li><strong>Doctoral</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The nature and design of CEFopoly is to mix three important elements in the game:</p>

<p><strong>Why CEFopoly Matters:</strong></p>
<p>Why encouraging higher education, innovation, and entrepreneurship matters- </p>
<p>When one looks at the great contributions made in the world over time - one of the great contributors within the last 240 years has been the USA.  There are three areas that stand out that have provided for significant advancement in the many areas that matter.   </p>
<p>[1.] The Morrill Land Grant Act of 1862 - Producing better educated and competently trained citizens to meet the demands of the future in a world that rewards education, the creation and or ownership of intellectual property, and entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>[2.] Making learning and education not only a rigorous academic activity - but also showing a young person the rewards of higher education in a fun and exciting way - CEFopoly does that.</p>
<p>[3.] It is true that “consumption” drives most economies - However, it is a well educated citizenry that allow countries to compete in a world of ever-higher requirements.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/422662/pictures/original/20120904125601-Afro-American_of_4_Playing_CEF_family1.jpg?1346788563"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>The game is designed to introduce many important areas within the college and university experience that will provide insight to the game playing participants. </p>
<p>CEFopoly will spark and ignite curiosity about Intellectual Property; one of the most dynamic asset groups in the industrialized world. </p>
<p>CEFopoly also introduces the game participant to the importance of entrepreneurship. </p>

<p>Providing an appreciation for learning and academic curiosity in the early years matters. </p>
<p>CEFopoly accepts the concept that early in a young persons life cycle habits and the appreciation for learning is most important.   CEFopoly is designed to take advantage of  “the enjoyment of playing games”  to creates the interest and curiosity of the subject matter  and areas shown in the game.</p>

<p><strong>Why you should Pledge &amp; What You Get for Pledging:</strong> </p>
<p>A lot of the heavy lifting to bring CEFopoly to market has been done.</p>
<p>The creator and designer of the game has spent over two years doing the research and assembling talent and skill to provide a great motivational aid and a relatively inexpensive tool for any person interested in providing a fun, engaging way to ignite interest, curiosity, and an understanding  of three subject [content] areas that matter.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><strong>The Value of introducing the concept of Intellectual Property</strong>:</p>
<p>In a report released in March of 2012 about the tremendous economic impact of <strong>intellectual property</strong>, one of the opening comments was: “Innovation, the process through which new ideas are generated and put into commercial practice, is a key force behind U.S. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">economic growth and national competitiveness</span></em>.”</p>
<p><strong>An extra benefit of CEFopoly</strong> </p>
<p>Many times in the world ones ability to get good and useful information is a function of circumstances [lucky or unlucky].  However, CEFopoly is available to any group of people who have access to the game - therefore many of the standard social-demographic statistics that can determine a persons life chances are bridged through CEFopoly, because the CEFopoly game is available to anyone regardless of social-demographic circumstance.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get </h3>
<p>What is required now is the capital funding to physically manufacture the game. Additionally, an app (digital application) is also contemplated to be introduced into the marketplace and to make available the CEFopoly game (message) digitally.</p>

""The 21-Day Vocal Practice Efficiency Program"" (for singers), is an extremely efficient step-by-step framework for dramatically improving your voice. 
The program is designed to put you in a position to reach to your true singing potential and abilities. How?

30 minutes of daily exercises give you the concrete tools to quickly get your voice into performance shape
A focus on your body and quickly and efficiently developing the muscles supporting the voice.
It's not about repetitive singing exercises (NO singing scales and arpeggios over and over!!)


It works.
As you complete the program you will experience:


 a higher and wider vocal range 


the ability to sing longer phrases without running out of air


more personality and depth in the quality of your tone


the ability to use your body to fully support your voice


concrete results every time you practice.


The program has been refined over several years through research, input by experts, and testing by professional musicians. 
Now I am taking the next step of releasing the full program to the public.
How did it happen?
My name is Sanne Graulund, and I'm a professional singer, composer and voice trainer from Copenhagen, Denmark. 
I've been writing, performing, and teaching musicians from many countries, and of all levels (from beginners to professional singers) for over 25 years.
In the beginning...Back when I was starting out as a professional musician, I was determined to succeed - and I did. However, I also used to suffer from performance anxiety. It would physically affect my voice and distract me from the music itself.
It was enormously frustating, but I was determined to do something about it.
From this frustration, emerged the seeds of The 21-Day Vocal Practice Efficiency Program.
The breakthrough!!I began developing a series of exercises for using my body to fully support my voice, and to my amazement, this quickly put me into the best performance shape of my life.
I learned to trust my voice, allowing me to fully overcome my earlier anxieties.
I began sharing these exercises with my students – I have been teaching  students of all levels, from beginners to professional singers, for over 25 years. They quickly experienced similar results as I had. They still do.

<p>Chinatown Youth Initiatives is a non-profit organization dedicated to empowering New York City Youth with the knowledge and skills to address the needs to Chinatown, Asian Americans and other underrepresented communities. Chinatown Beautification Day began as a project created by Chinatown Youth Initiative's 2003 Summer Leadership Institute. The original mission was to address concerns that Manhattan's Lower East Side had become neglected in the aftermath of 9/11. Since 2003, CYI has held CBD annually, consistently gathering between 150 and 350 high school youth to clean the streets of Chinatown. In 2009, CBD was expanded to include the citywide High School Youth Conference, which preceded CBD in the same weekend.<span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">Chinatown Beautification Day 2013!</span></p>
<p>The 11th Annual Chinatown Beautification Day is coming up on August 17th and 18th! Chinatown Beautification Day is a two-day event, consisting of a youth conference and a clean-up day during which student volunteers help tidy up Chinatown. At the conference, youth attend workshops on a variety of issues, including mental health, women's empowerment, hip hop as a tool for social justice, environmental justice, and cultural identity.</p>
<p>CBD is a great way for youth to get involved in their community as well as to meet new people and learn more about themselves. CBD is also a way to spread awareness about community service as well as protecting the environment of Chinatown to Chinatown residents and the greater community.</p>
<p>This year, our theme for CBD is ""Speak! Redefining Our Narratives."" During the event, we want students to explore what ""narrative"" means to them and share their own narratives with each other, learning from and redefining narratives together.</p>
<h3>We Need Your Help!</h3>
<p>In order for this event to be possible, we need to raise money in order to pay for supplies for cleaning, food for the conference, T-shirts for the participants, the various performers and speakers who help make up the CBD experience and for event space. </p>

<p><strong>Reversing African Brain Drain</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Recent estimates indicate that 20,000 African professionals (doctors, university lecturers, engineers, etc.) leave the continent of Africa every year adding to the 300,000 plus highly qualified African Diaspora. On the other hand, there has been a significant increase of students in African universities with few resources to meet their needs.  It is not unusual in some universities for a class to have over 500 students without textbooks. This shortage of teaching professionals affects the quality of classroom instruction. For the past five years, Here and Home, Inc. has collaborated with a number of African universities to address this problem by sending qualified volunteer teachers to teach classes during summer.  So far 23 professors, mostly African diaspora, have taught 25 courses to 710 students in five universities.  In order to provide the quality of instruction local teachers are working hard to maintain, we really need your help.</strong></p>

Working with the creative arts charity Dramatic Need, Angee and Colin will spend three weeks with secondary students at Pete Patsa Community Arts Centre, drawing, sharing stories, learning about animation and playing with optical toys. This self-funded trip is a cultural exchange as well as as an opportunity to foster self-confidence and self-expression in a creative environment - an opportunity that is rare for rural South African youth. <br/></span></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Expenses:</h3>
<p>We've already invested close to $4000 to get ourselves to and from South Africa. Now we are asking for help from friends to cover all the other costs associated with this adventure. We need to get from Johannesburg to Viljoenskroon, where we will be living and teaching. We need art supplies for our students, groceries, train tickets to Cape Town, vaccinations, and the like.</p>
<h3>Outcomes:</h3>
<p>We are visiting South Aftrica during winter break. Thus, we will be able to work with students in a concentrated environment, offering three week-long animation workshops to three different groups of students. These classes will culminate in a collection of finished animations - some combination of collaborative group projects and personal narratives or experiments.</p>
<p>In addition to facilitating student animations, this trip will also provide us much-needed time to create our own artwork. Through out our stay, we'll be plugging away on our own animation - a project we hope to be our most substantial collaborative animation yet!</p>

After receiving her BFA from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago in 2005, she founded a community printshop, Spudnik Press Cooperative. This non-profit organization has grown from a small work-live space to a 4,000 square foot studio. She oversees a range of community-based arts programming including open studio sessions, classes, a residency program, keyholder memberships, consignment printing, collaborative projects, youth programming, and exhibitions. </span><span style=""font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"">For the last 6 years, she has been a teaching artist at Marwen, an organization that educates and inspires under-served young people through the visual arts. Working with 6th through 12th grade students, she's led classes ranging from “Surreal Printmaking” to “Chicago Posters”. A recent class partnered with The Jane Addams Hull-House Museum. Students learned about the history of social justice, and created a zine addressing food, politics, and community. </span></p>

</div></div>","This June, teaching artists Angee Lennard and Colin Palombi will travel to Viljoenskroon, South Africa to help local youth create animations. Working with the creative arts charity Dramatic Need, Angee and Colin will spend three weeks with secondary students at Pete Patsa Community Arts Centre, drawing, sharing stories, learning about animation and playing with optical toys. This self-funded trip is a cultural exchange as well as as an opportunity to foster self-confidence and self-expression in a creative environment - an opportunity that is rare for rural South African youth. 


Expenses:
We've already invested close to $4000 to get ourselves to and from South Africa. Now we are asking for help from friends to cover all the other costs associated with this adventure. We need to get from Johannesburg to Viljoenskroon, where we will be living and teaching. We need art supplies for our students, groceries, train tickets to Cape Town, vaccinations, and the like.
Outcomes:
We are visiting South Aftrica during winter break. Thus, we will be able to work with students in a concentrated environment, offering three week-long animation workshops to three different groups of students. These classes will culminate in a collection of finished animations - some combination of collaborative group projects and personal narratives or experiments.
In addition to facilitating student animations, this trip will also provide us much-needed time to create our own artwork. Through out our stay, we'll be plugging away on our own animation - a project we hope to be our most substantial collaborative animation yet!
View the Dramatic Need blog to learn more about the organization we're partnering with. View our collaborative animations, Gulp and Gifting.


About the Teaching Artists:
Angee Lennard is an art administrator,  artist, and educator. After receiving her BFA from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago in 2005, she founded a community printshop, Spudnik Press Cooperative. This non-profit organization has grown from a small work-live space to a 4,000 square foot studio. She oversees a range of community-based arts programming including open studio sessions, classes, a residency program, keyholder memberships, consignment printing, collaborative projects, youth programming, and exhibitions. For the last 6 years, she has been a teaching artist at Marwen, an organization that educates and inspires under-served young people through the visual arts. Working with 6th through 12th grade students, she's led classes ranging from “Surreal Printmaking” to “Chicago Posters”. A recent class partnered with The Jane Addams Hull-House Museum. Students learned about the history of social justice, and created a zine addressing food, politics, and community.

Young Faces Smiling operates an innovative, school-based program that motivates and inspires students using lessons that incorporate real life examples and practical applications taken from student interviews of prominent leaders in business, fashion, entertainment, media, music, sports and politics.  This inventive approach, “Reality Teaching,” has proven to be highly effective in significantly improving academic performance, self-confidence and overall success rate of the students it serves. </p>

Young.”</i></p>
<p><b>-Nicholas,
Bread &amp; Roses HS</b></p>
<p><i>“I thought Ms. McClarty was making us write letters
just for fun or to rub the millionaires’ success on us.  I was amazed at how these famous hard-working
people took time out to see us.  Their
success inspired me.  Young Faces Smiling
would go along the best of the best.”</i></p>

had significant academic turnaround as a result of this program. Their
educational journey has become even greater than we have ever imagined. As a
result of this growth, the needs of Young Faces
Smiling have grown significantly. Our sole desire is to continue to serve students.

become more like statistics in remembrance. Like so many trailblazers before me,
I must push on in an effort to educate those not forgotten but those in power,
thus enabling the change in mindset and setting the tone for more greatness. Heralded
but this creation, Young Faces will Smile and rejoice in curriculum that doesn't
bore of benign redundancy as students embrace education related to what appeals

educational journey alone. I need your help. Please help me Put A Smile on Young
Faces.</p>

Young Faces Smiling (YFS) is a registered 501(c)(3), non-profit organization that is committed to improving the academic performance, self-esteem and overall achievement level of students in underserved communities. Young Faces Smiling operates an innovative, school-based program that motivates and inspires students using lessons that incorporate real life examples and practical applications taken from student interviews of prominent leaders in business, fashion, entertainment, media, music, sports and politics.  This inventive approach, “Reality Teaching,” has proven to be highly effective in significantly improving academic performance, self-confidence and overall success rate of the students it serves. 
Moreover, students will have an opportunity to associate and make powerful connections with successful celebrities who are as compassionate in education as educators.  But most importantly, given the current economic challenges facing us, supporters of Young Faces Smiling will make a significant difference in the lives of students at a time when it has never matter more. 
What is Reality Teaching?


Reality Teaching is media,
pop culture, and entertainment elements from the outside world bringing it into
the classroom to translate into math, English, science, social studies, arts
and technology, which will be taught to students in various lessons. Reality
Teaching will improve, inspire, and motivate students to increase their
academic performance emphasizing the importance of education.

How Do Students Feel About Young Faces Smiling


“I really appreciate all of your generosity and efforts
to change our outlook on life.  After
this program I realized that I could achieve my goals and accomplish my
dreams.  You have a huge heart Dr.
Young.”
-Nicholas,
Bread & Roses HS
“I thought Ms. McClarty was making us write letters
just for fun or to rub the millionaires’ success on us.  I was amazed at how these famous hard-working
people took time out to see us.  Their
success inspired me.  Young Faces Smiling
would go along the best of the best.”
-Amanda, South Bronx
Prep HS

Next Top Model and Ms. Westbrook from Jive Turkey was very exciting.  I had a lot of fun.”
-Tito, South
Bronx Prep HS
The Impact

Young Faces Smiling is our vision to stress the
importance of education and career exposure for students whom may never
experience this level of access throughout their regular public school journey.Our students have
had significant academic turnaround as a result of this program. Their
educational journey has become even greater than we have ever imagined. As a
result of this growth, the needs of Young Faces
Smiling have grown significantly. Our sole desire is to continue to serve students. 
Dr. Young and I have personally funded Young Faces Smiling for the duration of this company and are actively seeking funding
support.  



We truly appreciate your
support in advance.




Young Faces Smiling is my vision and dream. Young
Faces Smiling has the ability to empower children forgotten about who just
become more like statistics in remembrance. Like so many trailblazers before me,
I must push on in an effort to educate those not forgotten but those in power,
thus enabling the change in mindset and setting the tone for more greatness. Heralded
but this creation, Young Faces will Smile and rejoice in curriculum that doesn't
bore of benign redundancy as students embrace education related to what appeals
and appears most in our POP CULTURE TV SCREEN. I cannot continue this
educational journey alone. I need your help. Please help me Put A Smile on Young
Faces.





Young Faces Smiling has benefited from the participation and
endorsements of Mega-Businessman Warren Buffett, Grammy Winning Recording
Artist Sean Paul, Apprentice Winner Randal Pinkett, American Idol Winner Taylor
Hicks, Pastor Frederick K. C. Price, Grammy Award Winning Singer/Songwriter Rob

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>A lot of you here know me as Tron Bonne, but, my real name is Jessica Diamant. I'm 22 years old and I'm striving to finish my education. In 2012, I had applied and been accepted to Temple University Japan! I was very ready to go and save up money for tickets and to pay for little fees here and there. Sadly, there was one issue. That issue being Financial Viability. They needed you to have access to a certain amount of money to prove you'd be able to support yourself. I don't have that kind of money, nor anyone who can even remotely support me. With your help I should be able to go and achieve my dreams!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>What I truely would need is $35,000 to show my Financial Viability, but if I can even get a fraction of that, it would be extremely helpful!</p>
<p>Now, every single dollar you donate to me will go directly to getting me to Japan and or paying for college expenses. Such as Plane Tickets, Book Costs, semester payment, and general college fees.</p>
<p>Of course I wouldn't ask for all of this without any reward. I'm not completely insane! As any of you Tron Bonne Art fans would suspect, I'll be giving people commissions to whoever donates! There are different levels of donating perks. Each has their own specifics about the reward.</p>
<p>Check the Perk list on the side!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Besides you guys helping me finish my schooling, you are actually asissting with a lot more than just that. Some of you who know me, will know this. I was actually born in Yokosuka, Japan and had left there when I was a little baby. All of my life I had heard wonderful stories about how amazing the experience was there. Just taking in all the culture, and the sights. My parents had vowed to take me back at some point.</p>
<p>In 2006, on my 16th birthday I had recieved tickets to go to Japan in that October. Sadly, something had come up with bills and my father had to sell our tickets. I understood and knew my father would do anything to get me there so we could see it. Sadly, in 2009, my father had passed away due to lymphoma. Not even more than a full year had passed and then my mother had succumbed to her cancer.</p>
<p>So, any of you donating to this are proving to me that you're all my heroes. You are helping see my birthplace, get my education and experience my past in ways I could never even imagine.</p>
<p>Also, any of you can feel free to message me at my <a href=""mailto:asktron@gmail.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>asktron@gmail.com</strong></a> email if you have ANY questions.</p>

<p><span>I'm a father of two wonderful children living halfway across the country away from George Washinton High School in Charleston, West Virginia. In fact, I've never met her. The story of Katelyn struck a chord with me; the growing rejection of scientifically supported information that is being pushed on children is horrifying.

<p>Mark O'Brien survived childhood polio to become a poet and journalist.  Although he was paralyzed from the neck down, he left a northern California nursing home to attend UC Berkeley, graduating in 1982 with a degree in English.  As he said in his address to the English department commencement in 1998, ""I love this university.  It saved my life.""</p>

Dr. Mshomba is a true Lasallian leader, his ongoing devotion to this project is impressive and worthy of our attention and support.Dr. Mshomba has given us the privilege to aid in his dream of completing the library.  Project TanzaniaThe library is the first step in helping provide children in Tanzania a better education.  Educational services in Tanzania result in very poor student performance. In 2012, 60% of the 411,000 students who sat for the National Form IV Exam (taken in the final year of secondary school) failed.  Many teachers within the educational system have a profiteering mentality.  Most students in Tanzania don’t have access to textbooks and other learning resources.

Your donation will help complete the library's infrastructure. The quantity needed to complete this entire project is US$15,000.  We are also exploring other avenues to raise the funds needed to finish the library. The Mshomba's have been working closely with a group of six very capable, honest, and dedicated volunteers in Tanzania in planning and supervising the construction of the library. They will continue working with them to manage the provision of library services.
The library still needs windows, doors, and gutters. The property that the library is being built on is approximately an acre in size; a wall needs to be constructed around its parameter with a 90-yard walking path to the entrance of the library. The Mshomba's are making arrangements with colleagues in Sinon and neighboring communities to donate funds for shelves and books.
No matter what amount Project Tanzania is able to raise, it will be completed, but without your help it could take years.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns
