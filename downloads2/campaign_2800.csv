<h3>La Historia</h3>
<p>Isham Arte Consciente nace con el propósito de generar un despertar de consciencia a través del arte en conjunto. Ningún elemento en la Naturaleza trabaja solo, todo es en conjunto; del mismo modo, el movimiento Isham invita a involucrarse a las diferentes corrientes artísticas de manera consciente con esta expresión multidisciplinaria, para llevar un mensaje de paz y unidad, al poner nuestros talentos de manera conjunta al servicio de los demás; de ese modo se recrea la expansión, la abundancia y la belleza.</p>
<h3>El Propósito</h3>
<p>Esta campaña tiene como propósito recaudar los fondos necesarios para continuar haciendo posible este sueño que ya ha sido realidad en la ciudad de <a href=""https://youtu.be/7287P1qyRjE"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Morelia, Michoacán México</a>. Nuestra intención es compartir esta bella experiencia, mostrándola a todo el mundo. Las esculturas llegan en blanco a cada país y son pintadas por artistas de cada región, así la obra es nueva y fresca, pero en sincronicidad de intenciones y con el toque artístico singular de cada quien.</p>
<h3>El Impacto</h3>
<p>Con estas exposiciones por todo el mundo, el movimiento Isham Arte Consciente, logra inspirar a todo aquél que entra en contacto con las obras de arte, dejando una semilla de consciencia en su corazón, sobre todo en los niños; mediante el ejemplo de poner los talentos al servicio de los demás. Logrando un verdadero cambio social.</p>
<h3>Lo que necesitamos y lo que obtienes</h3>
<p>Para realizar este sueño Se necesitan $20,000.00 dólares norteamericanos.</p>
<p>¿En qué se invertirá todo este dinero?</p>
<p>Incluye:</p>
<ul>
<li>Costo de fabricación de 30 esculturas y sus bases de madera.</li>
<li>Transportación terrestre desde Guadalajara, Jalisco México hasta el Puerto de Veracruz.</li>
<li>Transportación marítima desde Veracruz Puerto a La Habana y finalmente a Santiago de Cuba.</li>
<li>Elementos audiovisuales al momento del evento, mamparas, lonas, textos informativos, cédulas de las obras, catálogo de la exposición (libro).</li>
<li>Elaboración de al menos un video documental.</li>
<li>Insumos para que los pintores realicen la obra.</li>
<li>Viáticos para el equipo Isham desde México a Santiago de Cuba.</li>
<li>Las recompensas como agradecimiento a tu colaboración.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tenemos varios niveles de recompensas para los donantes que van desde $10.00 dólares norteamericanos hasta $500.00 dólares.</p>
<p>La recompensa de $250.00 dólares es una escultura original de la obra <strong>“Con el corazón Abierto”</strong> en tamaño mediano de 70 cm de alto en blanco. Se envía mediante paquetería a tu casa añadiendo el gasto de envío a todo el mundo; así tú y tu familia en conjunto pueden pintarla y sincronizar sus talentos, plasmándolos en el corazón de la familia, la cual es sin duda, una gran experiencia para chicos y grandes. El nombre del patrocinador o patrocinadores, será o serán grabados en la cédula de una de las piezas exhibidas; del mismo modo, el nombre del colaborador o colaboradores serán plasmados en el libro de la exposición.</p>

<p>La recompensa de $550.00 dólares es una escultura de tamaño original en blanco, 1.60 m. de alto incluyendo la base, como la que es usada en los eventos de Isham, más gastos de envío.

Es también, sin lugar a dudas, toda una experiencia familiar o de equipo, ya que dejará plasmada la intención de armonizar a todos los que se involucren a pintarla. Además, el nombre del patrocinador irá en las cédulas de las piezas pintadas por los artistas cubanos, así como en el libro de la exposición.</p>

<h3><strong>El impacto</strong></h3>
<p>Las personas que entran en contacto con las obras del movimiento Isham, son impactadas por la vibración que éstas emanan. En física cuántica está demostrado que la consciencia influye en la materia y le impregna información, es por eso que el reunir talentos distintos, con estilos y técnicas diferentes; pero sincronizados en un mismo propósito, las esculturas quedan potencializadas e irradian dicha intención más allá del tiempo y espacio. El impacto de movimiento Isham Arte Consciente da como resultado la trasformación interna de los individuos; de este modo, este movimiento, influye de manera decisiva en las personas para mejorar su sociedad. El impacto emocional en ellas es evidente y contundente.</p>

<h3>El Desafío </h3>
<p>El desafío al cual nos enfrentamos es la brevedad tiempo y la escasez de los recursos. Desde sus inicios, Isham nació desafiando estos dos aspectos. El evento de Morelia se realizó en sólo un mes. Poco a poco y de manera paulatina, fueron apareciendo los recursos y, al tiempo, se iba multiplicando porque muchas personas con el Corazón abierto se fueron sumando para apoyar este movimiento de arte consciente que trasforma corazones.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Es por eso que, cuando viene un pensamiento de: ¿Y si no lo logramos? sólo lo dejamos pasar y decimos: ¿Y cómo sí?, ¿Cómo sí le podemos hacer para que se logre? Así las ideas empiezan a llegar. Yo diría que es como magia, pero así es.</p>

The funding goal reflects the value of the $100 USD <strong><a href=""https://tinyurl.com/ya8hnasf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">paintings in stock</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Financing: I want to buy the property outright as opposed to carrying a large mortgage. If, at the end of this campaign, there isn't enough to proceed, all money raised will go into a savings account while fundraising continues.</p>

<h3>The J. Scott Theater</h3>
<p>The J. Scott theater is a historic building in the heart of Atlanta, Georgia.  Our plan is to design a new space to be a replica of an historic building. This project is designed to reignite the excitement of the various Art forms while bringing art to the public and the public to art. Picture it: a member based Arts Community with Theater in an Intimate Boutique Hotel setting. The goal of this hotel will be to help starving artists gain a platform in which to display their amazing creations. The building restoration, a 3-story, Theater, art themed boutique hotel, will showcase artwork from local artists as well as provide a family friendly atmosphere where travelers with children can rest, learn, explore and fall in love with the world of artistic creation.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Goal</h3>
<p>This project will be a membership based platform. Members will pay a fee of $152.21 to join. These members will be our artists. They will be able to display their artwork as well as a plaque with their name in front of their artwork. As long as the artist is a member and the artwork is child-friendly, and will have a display for up to a year. The artist will even have the opportunity to place their work on consignment, such that visitors may purchase the amazing artistic creations. In addition, a portion of any money made will be dipped back into the community and shared with local non-profit organizations.</p>
<p>The HC will also offer performances, meeting spaces, and access to artists grants. We will have some of the benefits of a five-star hotel, but the price will be affordable and the artists will gain experience for their CV's.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Task</h3>
<p>We mentioned everything needs restoring. There is the Theater Space, common areas including rooms at the J. Scott. Interior and exterior renovations are expected to cost an average of $4,807 per space. Therefore, we have started this campaign to help us make this dream a reality and begin the project.</p>
<p>We are asking for your help.  Please donate if you can. However, more importantly, please share our campaign with your circle of influence. The more people aware of our efforts, the closer we will be to reaching our goal.</p>

<h3>Though we can't dance together right now...</h3>
<p>...we can still share the love and connection of the old-time dance community through a beautiful piece of artwork!</p>
<p>I'm Paul Silveria, I play banjo and call square dances. Early this year I released a  guide to square dancing and dance calling. Now I'm making a beautiful letterpress poster featuring my original illustrations from the book!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Square Dancing is important. So are handmade things.</h3>
<p>I've always thought that old-time square dancing is magical - Live music, dancing with strangers, a caller picking up the vibe of the room and leading everyone through a comfortable challenge... Square dancing is community connection at it's finest, and we need that more than ever right now. Since we can't dance as a community, we can at least have something beautiful to remind us of what we are struggling for while we stay apart. We are working for a world where we can come back stronger and more connected. Where we can share food, help our friends and neighbours, and, of course, dance together!</p>
<p>I've known multiple letterpress artists who are also old-time musicians. (Stumptown Printers in Portland, and Clawhammer Press in Fernie BC both come to mind!) One key to this connection is the idea that old artforms are worth remembering, re-imaginging, and keeping alive. Just as we feel a difference when we hear music played live, we feel a difference when we see and touch a poster that's been carefully crafted and pressed by hand. That connection to the past, and to each other, is worth supporting!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>This campaign is simple - Just pre-order your poster!</h3>
<p>My goal covers the cost of designing and printing posters. Everything above the goal will be much-needed income in these gig-less times.</p>
<p>For the poster, I'll be working with the same designer (<strong><a href=""https://www.ravenbookdesign.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Linda Parke of Raven Book Design</a></strong>) and print shop (<strong><a href=""https://porchlightpress.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Porchlight Press</a></strong>) that made the cover for my guide to square dancing, so I already know how amazing it will look. I'll also be making greeting cards, and offering other perks as well.</p>
<p>This campaign is all-or-nothing. With no music income, I can't cover any funding shortfalls - so if it doesn't get fully funded here, it won't happen. Your help now will make it possible!</p>

produce new work for the festival.</p>
<p>Nigel Rolfe (IR), Kurt Johannessen (NO), Abraham Brody (USA/UK), Karianne Stensland (NO), John Court (UK/FI), Katri Kainulainen &amp; Maximilian Latva (FI), Vincent Campos (FR) and István Kovács (HU)   </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>The funds from this campaign go to the artists travel, food and material costs, including a artist fee.</b></p>
<p>Due to the rigorous cuts in arts it is more important than ever  to create an artistic platform to explore new ways of communication and interaction with one another away from mainstream culture; trying to democratize and decentralize art. Not excluding but including the rural districts, sharing and experiencing art and nature together. </p>

</div>
<p><b><a href=""http://www.venogardkunst.com/?p=532"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><font color=""c40079"">Abraham Brody (England / USA)</font></a></b> a performer who breaks the boundaries between classical, folk, and contemporary music. He brings the violin into the genre of performance art as a means to deepen contact between performer and public.</p>
<p><b><a href=""http://www.venogardkunst.com/?p=398"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><font color=""c40079"">István Kovács (Hungary)</font></a></b> installations and performances have radiated an almost religious devotion to Nature. This often gives the immediate impression that each of his creations is a kind of prayer rooted in humility and awe. A truly inspired spirituality shines through his work. </p>
<p><b><a href=""http://www.venogardkunst.com/?p=384"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><font color=""c40079"">John Court (Finland / England)</font></a></b> output includes performance, sculpture and Video, but he considers all his work to be fundamentally concerned with drawing, in that drawing connects the elements of line, movement, space and time.</p>
<p><b><a href=""http://www.venogardkunst.com/?p=527"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><font color=""c40079"">Karianne Stensland (Norway)</font></a></b> works with investigation and reformulation of gender, power and rank. Her work comprise elements of mixed media, often presented through performance, video or installations.</p>
<p><b><a href=""http://www.venogardkunst.com/?p=388"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><font color=""c40079"">Katri Kainulainen &amp; Maximilian Latva (Finland)</font></a></b> are two artists who have recently started performing together, this is what Katri says about it ""<i>In performance I am myself. Through performance one can process a part of you, a part that needs to be communicated with. So joint performances are an interesting way of being with someone you are close with… </i>"" </p>

He tries to keep whatever else as open as possible so as not to precondition the possibilities. This is the starting point. At the same time, however, he is concerned with finding situations that can generate qualities that he has not experienced before.</p>
<p><b><a href=""http://www.venogardkunst.com/?p=490"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><font color=""c40079"">Nigel Rolfe (Ireland)</font></a></b> the central contention of his practice is that art making is a live and vital engagement. He studied sculpture and in the 1970’s used the term “Sculptures In Motion” to describe his work using materials across time—long before the term performance was put forward as any descriptor.</p>
<p><b><a href=""http://www.venogardkunst.com/?p=390"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><font color=""c40079"">Vincent Campos (France)</font></a></b> is interested in peoples interaction with his installations and performances.

<h3><font color=""c40079"">The Location</font></h3>
<p>Olav Venø is the owner of the beautiful island where the festival will take place. The 400 acres of farm has been in the Venø family for more than 400 years. The next generation are working towards ways to share this sublime spot of nature in order to built bridges to culture and the community.</p>

<h3>
<font color=""c40079"">Why Performance art?</font>
</h3>
<div>
<p>Performance art is a form of art that gives the audience a direct connection with the artwork, because the artist and artwork is one. Performance art is a form of expression that is created in the here and now, leading to a intensity in the meeting between the artwork and viewer, which is different from what is created in static art or art that is experienced via a screen. The fact that the viewer becomes part of the creation process of the artwork and in some cases the artwork itself gives a unique attachment to the work. We believe that performance art, when it is experienced, can contribute to an understanding of how art is created. This may be because performance art gives an insight in to the artist’s energy and mind.</p>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3><font color=""c40079"">Why in Nature?</font></h3>
<p>The nature in Norway is unique and beautiful, but for some of us who live between the hills and mountains, it has become mundane. A performance artist can either help us experience nature anew or intensify the moment. He or she can create a moment that perceptually lasts longer. Our attention has been focused, just like when we look at a beautiful sunset or a unique play of light. It causes us to linger a little longer at a spot seen many times before. Because a human has created the moment, it might help us to think about the interaction between man and nature. We believe these qualities of performance art can help create a better understanding of contemporary art as a hole.</p>

</div></div>","Venø Gård KUNST is a two day International Performance Art Festival on the island Venøy in Selje, Sogn og
Fjordane on the 11th and 12th of July 2015. This is the first time the festival will take place. We have invited nine artists from various countries to
produce new work for the festival.
Nigel Rolfe (IR), Kurt Johannessen (NO), Abraham Brody (USA/UK), Karianne Stensland (NO), John Court (UK/FI), Katri Kainulainen & Maximilian Latva (FI), Vincent Campos (FR) and István Kovács (HU)   
The funds from this campaign go to the artists travel, food and material costs, including a artist fee.
Due to the rigorous cuts in arts it is more important than ever  to create an artistic platform to explore new ways of communication and interaction with one another away from mainstream culture; trying to democratize and decentralize art. Not excluding but including the rural districts, sharing and experiencing art and nature together. 
We hope to Kindle, Unite, Nurture and Stimulate Thought through KUNST, which means art in Norwegian.

Norwegian Organisation Number: 9114911273 



 The Perks
Nature lover / Nature lover Extreme

Souvenir / Art poster lover / Art print lover 


Wearable Support


Ebook of Festival / Festival Art Book

Webcam Art Performance / Personal Performance (New Work!)




 We need your help
We contribute the location and our time, but believe that artists should be paid for the work they do. With your financial help we will be able to pay a minimum of 25% of their fee, in addition covering travel costs, materials and food. In return we will reward you with our gratitude and perks that truly are embeded with sweat, tears, passion and soul.

How the money will be distributed:















27% of our budget is the bare minimum to make this project happen, that is why this campaign is ""fixed funding"", meaning if we don't meet our minimum goal, the project will not happen and all contributions will be refunded. 
We hope to raise the remaining 63% funding for the festival from local businesses and applications to the Norwegian Arts Council, Sogn Og Fjordane Fylkes Komune, KORO, Selje Komune and Norske Billedkunstnere Project Support. We are always on the look out for relevant funding bodies to write to, so do let us know if we have missed any? 
As of 1st of January 2015  we have yet to receive a positive reply to our funding applications, but we are still writing new applications.

The Artists

Abraham Brody (England / USA) a performer who breaks the boundaries between classical, folk, and contemporary music. He brings the violin into the genre of performance art as a means to deepen contact between performer and public.
István Kovács (Hungary) installations and performances have radiated an almost religious devotion to Nature. This often gives the immediate impression that each of his creations is a kind of prayer rooted in humility and awe. A truly inspired spirituality shines through his work. 
John Court (Finland / England) output includes performance, sculpture and Video, but he considers all his work to be fundamentally concerned with drawing, in that drawing connects the elements of line, movement, space and time.
Karianne Stensland (Norway) works with investigation and reformulation of gender, power and rank. Her work comprise elements of mixed media, often presented through performance, video or installations.
Katri Kainulainen & Maximilian Latva (Finland) are two artists who have recently started performing together, this is what Katri says about it ""In performance I am myself. Through performance one can process a part of you, a part that needs to be communicated with. So joint performances are an interesting way of being with someone you are close with… "" 
Kurt Johannessen (Norway) to be present in the situation is fundamental for his work. He tries to keep whatever else as open as possible so as not to precondition the possibilities. This is the starting point. At the same time, however, he is concerned with finding situations that can generate qualities that he has not experienced before.
Nigel Rolfe (Ireland) the central contention of his practice is that art making is a live and vital engagement. He studied sculpture and in the 1970’s used the term “Sculptures In Motion” to describe his work using materials across time—long before the term performance was put forward as any descriptor.
Vincent Campos (France) is interested in peoples interaction with his installations and performances. He tries to focus on the relationship between the two and what the audience will experience.




The Location
Olav Venø is the owner of the beautiful island where the festival will take place. The 400 acres of farm has been in the Venø family for more than 400 years. The next generation are working towards ways to share this sublime spot of nature in order to built bridges to culture and the community.


Why Performance art?


Performance art is a form of art that gives the audience a direct connection with the artwork, because the artist and artwork is one. Performance art is a form of expression that is created in the here and now, leading to a intensity in the meeting between the artwork and viewer, which is different from what is created in static art or art that is experienced via a screen. The fact that the viewer becomes part of the creation process of the artwork and in some cases the artwork itself gives a unique attachment to the work. We believe that performance art, when it is experienced, can contribute to an understanding of how art is created. This may be because performance art gives an insight in to the artist’s energy and mind.

Why in Nature?
The nature in Norway is unique and beautiful, but for some of us who live between the hills and mountains, it has become mundane. A performance artist can either help us experience nature anew or intensify the moment. He or she can create a moment that perceptually lasts longer. Our attention has been focused, just like when we look at a beautiful sunset or a unique play of light. It causes us to linger a little longer at a spot seen many times before. Because a human has created the moment, it might help us to think about the interaction between man and nature. We believe these qualities of performance art can help create a better understanding of contemporary art as a hole.


The Staff





Erik Friis Reitan (Norway) will lead the two panel discussions. He is a visual artist working with photography and installation.
Photographic Documentation the 27% does not cover funding for this.
Video Documentation the 27% does not cover funding for this.




The Organisers

Julia Kröner works in fashion with a strong belief in the importance of Art.
Anita Eide is an artist who has chosen to live on Venøy.
Jessica Venø is the youngest member of our team, specialising in creating events. 
Olav and Elaine Venø are supplying practical support to the festival, such as the the location, housing and making food.

<p>Welcome to my campaign! I'm Kayla, a college freshman at University of California, Irvine. Right now, I'm a biological sciences major with an intended minor in digital arts. This campaign is for an enamel pin I'm attempting to produce. In order to be able to make my pins, I need 100 buyers at $5 a piece. Seeing my art come to life is something I've dreamt of for awhile, so I hope you guys can help me make it can happen! For every $5 you pledge, you receive a pin. If you want to pledge more than $5 without receiving multiple pins, shoot me an email and I'll make a special perk just for you.</p>
<h2><strong>What We Need, What You Get, &amp; Risks</strong></h2>
<p>All of the money funded will go towards the production of my enamel pins. If the goal is reached, I will be able to send in my order with the company I'm working with. Once I get more images of prototypes and such, I'll be able to share them with you guys. As soon as I get the pins, I'll be able to deliver them to you! If I don't reach my goal, all the money will go back to my backers, no risk :)</p>

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3><p>Hello. My name is Artem Karsakov, I am an artist, and planning to create a full-length cartoon. For clarity, I recommend to watch the trailer and two animatics.</p><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/uj1L1J3AjB4?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div><div>
<p> </p>
<p>The animatic is a rough version of the planned material to give a hint what result should be. The cartoon itself, of course, will have a detailed drawing of backgrounds and animations, and have professional voice acting.</p>
</div><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/KNa7WSMeAVI?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div><div> </div><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/95Un7LLbuyg?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div><div> </div><p>The quality is not perfect, we still have a lot to learn, but these materials give some idea about the atmosphere of the cartoon. So general information:</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1508648585/ouwsldugrpaz1l8hzntc.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h3><strong>Problem</strong></h3><p>I like animation. But sometimes I want to watch something directed not only at mass, where all the originality will not be cut in favor of restrictive ratings, target groups, where everything will not be blurred to get the greatest reach of auditory. Also, I want cartoon to be not only entertaining but mental food. So the problem is defined, let’s solve it.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1508648665/pkpbrqrzasuvrdgwrsah.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h3><strong>Idea</strong></h3><p>To be short the main line of cartoon is:</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Young man get a job as a courier under the supernatural creature. Profitable deal turns into a deadly trap, which forces the hero to challenge to the powerful master.</i></p><p>The sense of the “Courier” story can be divided into two layers. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1508648938/xvdkqiix2djkmbogzprl.jpg"" src=""""/></p><ol>
<li value=""NaN"">Becoming of a man. At the beginning of the story the hero is lazy, arrogant and irresponsible, but at the end he is not afraid of work, he is friendly with simple workers, he thinks, makes a decisions and is ready to risk own life, if necessary.</li>
<li value=""NaN"">There is an allegorical description of situation of our society in the second layer. Recently past –man is a friend, comrade and brother to a man. The current present – man is a wolf to man. And searching of future, justice.</li>

My name is Artem Karsakov, I am an artist, and planning to create a full-length cartoon. For clarity, I recommend to watch the trailer and two animatics.
 
The animatic is a rough version of the planned material to give a hint what result should be. The cartoon itself, of course, will have a detailed drawing of backgrounds and animations, and have professional voice acting.
  The quality is not perfect, we still have a lot to learn, but these materials give some idea about the atmosphere of the cartoon. So general information:ProblemI like animation. But sometimes I want to watch something directed not only at mass, where all the originality will not be cut in favor of restrictive ratings, target groups, where everything will not be blurred to get the greatest reach of auditory. Also, I want cartoon to be not only entertaining but mental food. So the problem is defined, let’s solve it.IdeaTo be short the main line of cartoon is:Young man get a job as a courier under the supernatural creature. Profitable deal turns into a deadly trap, which forces the hero to challenge to the powerful master.The sense of the “Courier” story can be divided into two layers. 
Becoming of a man. At the beginning of the story the hero is lazy, arrogant and irresponsible, but at the end he is not afraid of work, he is friendly with simple workers, he thinks, makes a decisions and is ready to risk own life, if necessary.
There is an allegorical description of situation of our society in the second layer. Recently past –man is a friend, comrade and brother to a man. The current present – man is a wolf to man. And searching of future, justice.
For the atmosphere I plan some synthesis of “Deadman” by Jarmusch and fairy tails by Miyazaki, for example “Princess Mononoke”, and dilute it by surrealism and humor like in an old Soviet cartoons “Wow, Speaking Fish”, “Snow of Last Year Was Falling”, ”Laughter and Sorrow Near the White Sea”.There are two reasons for black and white gamma. Firstly, it gives noir atmosphere.  Secondly, it is easy for me to work in, so the project will go faster and takes less money.ProgressFirst episode contains about 250 scenes. Duration is about 20 minutes. What has already been done:Backgrounds: 189 of 250Animation: 8 of 250Music: 4 of ?Noise Design: 0 of 250Voice Acting: 0 of 140Approximately once a month I publish video reports with demonstration of some materials in our channel. With this reports you can estimate the pace of work. Do not forget to switch on the English subtitles.   Financial TargetIt should be full-time working day to create the cartoon in good quality. To finish it faster I need a team.Several months ago not big budget was collected that allow to create a part of work and gather small team – three artists and music composer. Nevertheless, there is not enough resources to complete episode, the reason is lack of money.To complete the remaining part it's needed:$9000 – Survival ModeThere are still some stocks, so with this amount the episode will be finished. However, it will be very difficult. Perhaps there will be a need to earn extra money on third-party projects.12 000 $ - Comfortable WorkThis sum allows us to work quicker and gives time for experiments and better detailing. All of these will improve the overall quality.18 000 $ - Speed Up ProcessThe range from the previous to this amount will allow expand the team, and you will see the result sooner.AlsoIn total, there were planned five episodes. Approximately 15-20 minutes each. If the campaign will be successful, then I switch it to InDemand mode and add more stretch goals. The voice acting will be in Russian with subtitles for other languages. If there will be enough interest to the project, I try to organize English sound.Previous works""Black Earth"" is my first animation experience. It is a music video for our group “Reminor”. The project took two years, because I had to work on it in free time and weekends. It means that I have the endurance to bring large projects to the end. You can find my previous pictures here: http://timbayo.deviantart.com/gallery/Other Ways You Can HelpHere are the links where we publish our music and news about “Courier”.

culture of some places in the world to show that we're all the same race. Regardless the gender, the traditions, culture or religion, we want to gather people, paint their skin and take incomparable and unique photos in emblematic places around the world.</p>
<p>We have painted people in
Colombia, with amazing results, and now, we want to do it directly in other
places of the world. For this project we have chosen seven countries: China,
India, Egypt, Grece, Italy, Norway and Mexico, which have been transcendental
in the development of our society through their culture, life and history. We
have done a few examples of this photos with some women which show a bit of our

In our team, we are specialized, been creative designer and painter, photographer, and post producer, making a complete group to achieve an excellent work.  We believe that the human body is the ultimate expression of perfection, and then, we have recognized the power of the bodypainting as a way to teach history, art, culture, religion and representative stories of each society.

<p><strong>Where: BURNING MAN 2017</strong></p>
<p><strong>Who we are:</strong>  We are group of four taking the art car plunge on our 4<sup>th</sup> year on the playa.   S’moreHaus was born because burners get hungry and sometimes you really wish one of those art cars would stop and ask you to ride...  and feed you.  </p>
<p><strong>What we’ll do: </strong>We plan to pick you up, and go where you go on the playa. It’s important to us that the gifting spirit of Burning Man 2017 is part of our journey as some of our best memories have come from other’s generosity.   If you’ve ever been half way home and hungry, we hope to solve that.  </p>
<p><strong>What you’ll do: </strong> Donate.  Help us.  Come get toasty.    Plan a fire and we’ll visit.  Make some toasty sticks! Tell us what you want to do! </p>
<p><strong>Funds: </strong>Every year gets stricter, so we anticipate upgrades and requirements back from BM 2017 DMV.  We also need supplies as we are going ALL WEEK.   We’d like to get enough help to plan times we can park and give.  Sound/Music isn’t possible right now given all the rest of the expenses but if we can raise this, we could host a DJ or Musician on the roof.  </p>
<p><strong>Impact: </strong>We’ve all been there, a little too tired or ambitious with our playa playing or hanging out at the many fires people create throughout the Playa.  Imagine bracing yourself for the long walk across the playa only to be picked up in a S’moreHaus.   We want to be the beaming S’moreHaus on the horizon.   I think the Playa need ‘smore art cars like the S’moreHaus.   The Biggest Little S'moreHaus that could... you get where we are going with this.</p>
<p><strong>Ways you can help: </strong> if you can’t donate, you can create.   We are busy employed adult people and running a S’moreHaus takes a lot out of you so get to know us.  We worry about having mechanical issues on Playa and have to have it towed out and in.     We’re in NYC and ATL so get to know us!  </p>

<p>Hello everyone!  Thanks for taking the time to check out our campaign! We want to give you a little backstory about us and go over the risks, ambitions and perks of our campaign.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Once Upon A Time...</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>We started Champaign Paper to make extra income after our youngest child was born and Elisabeth quit her full-time job to care for our three children. As our little business grew, Shaun was able to quit his corporate job and we both were able to pursue our company full-time. We love that we can work from home and also be able to care for our children simultaneously, but we have run out of room in our studio, and it's time for an upgrade!</p>
</div><div>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1535986361/s2m7efw6encsmy1zc7ml.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>After traveling all over the country attending markets and being able to bring our products to customers in over 60 stores across the United States &amp; Canada, we are ready to grow even more. We've heard a great deal of amazing feedback about our products from our customers and it encourages us to keep pursuing our entrepreneurial spirit. Our small business has grown extensively in the last four years and we have several projects and ideas we'd love to pursue in the near future. Champaign Paper is ready to do epic shit!</p>
<p>We've been told by our customers that they'd love to see our products in a brick and mortar of our own and on other products such as t-shirts and mugs. In order to accomplish these goals, this campaign would facilitate our small business in creating new items, purchase the necessary equipment needed for development, and give us more space in a larger studio outside of our home. The support we would receive from this campaign would give us a head start on these goals and help Champaign Paper grow into the reality we've been dreaming of.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1536000160/bdxbzlkczb5gomm19yvm.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>WHAT WE NEED &amp; WHAT YOU GET</strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>You might be asking yourself: ""Why don't they just have someone else print their shirts?""  Great question!  We design, print, package and ship all of our products from our in-home studio.  We love the DIY aspect of our company and we strive to make everything that we sell (with the exception of enamel pins because who knows how to make those???) ourselves. </p>
<p>Our goal for this campaign is to reach or surpass $3,000. It's enough to get us started in the direction of our dreams and tackle two very important goals: t-shirts &amp; a new studio.</p>
<p>We will begin by purchasing the necessary equipment needed to make our very own t-shirts! We will also continue our efforts of finding an affordable studio that would be large enough to create all of our products and store our equipment. We have some places in mind, so stay tuned! ;)  Even if we do not reach our entire goal, anything will help us pave the way for our future plans!</p>

<h3>THE IMPACT</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Our dream is valuable to us and to other young entrepreneurs because it allows us to fulfill our ambition of creating beautiful paper goods and other fine products people can be delighted about.  One of our favorites parts of running Champaign Paper is the excitement that our art gives people when they experience it in person.  Bringing joy, comfort or making people laugh at one of our cards is one of the best parts of our job!</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>RISKS &amp; CHALLENGES</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>We've had the comfort of being able to do what we do within our home and the thought of moving our studio to its own building is a little scary. However, we have a tiny room we currently use and we haven't been able to develop certain products (like shirts!) simply because we do not have the space. Adding an additional monthly expense is a little terrifying, but we believe where there is a will there is a way! </p>

<p>The Home Brewer's Formulary is a poster featuring a collection of formulas, charts, graphs and other info used in a typical home brewery. It is also an attractive, full color poster about beer and beer making for brewers, homebrewers and beer enthusiasts.  Each poster will be offset print on 100b, glossy paper in full color, and will measure  24"" by 36"".They look great framed or laminated.</p>
<h3>Current Goals and Perks</h3>
<p>This fundraising effort is to get me the capitol to do some revisions and updates and do another print run of this popular poster.   Supporting this effort means you'll help revive a home brewing classic, and the main perks are - posters!  Supporters will be the first people who can get this poster, which is not currently available anywhere else.  And check out the perks section for a few useful bundles and higher quality print versions.</p>

<p> </p>
<h3>A little History</h3>
<p>This project grew out of a desire on the part of a couple of dedicated home brewers to have better references on hand. Originally introduced in 1998 and sold until the early 2000's at homebrew stores, at beer festivals and online, the poster was out of print for a number of years. In 2013, I revived it, did a print run, and sold those posters online, mostly to individuals and pretty much just paying back the print run costs and other expenses. Now those posters are gone, and people still want copies.</p>
<h3>Time for an update</h3>
<p>So, it's time to do another print run, and I think it's a good time to update some of the info. Particularly I want to revise the information on Hop Varieties, which is pretty dated, and does not reflect trends over the past few decades. I'll also take this opportunity to review information on grains, and just check and make sure that nothing else has changed. The poster will remain virtually the same visually.</p>

Artist: Dartdara What is A Memory of Eternity? A Memory of Eternity is an experimental and narrative-driven video game series, with both SFW and NSFW entries. Currently the third game is in development, Memoirs of a Battle Brothel, following the beautiful and deadly women of MoonFall’s Courtesan’s Guild. Trained as both fighters and high-class escorts, the courtesans of MoonFall take the main stage in Cyberpunk Babes and Lovecraftian Horrors. A Memory of Eternity also contains a strong meta-narrative and loads of what many people would consider weird or mind-screwy elements. You can check out the series on Steam or on A Memory of Eternity's Patreon page below:  18+ (NSFW) contentSince we have been working in both SFW and NSFW (18+) categories, we've accumulated a lot of art that is unmistakably more adult in nature. Please be aware that the artbook will have art exploring human (mostly human, at any rate) sexuality. Sometimes in weird and unexpected ways. Risks and ChallengesHi everyone, this is TORii, I've been working with A Memory of Eternity/Manly Mouse Dan for a while now, and I'm in charge of putting this artbook together. I have to say that I'm super excited to finally be able to put the shared universe that we've been building for so long finally on real pages.Between the two of us, we have extensive experience in both publication design and writing, so I see no barriers to a digital PDF release of the artbook. As for a physical print publication, that is something new to me, but I don’t expect it to be an issue either.",7.0,0,"1 Campaign

Hi
everyone!</p>
<p>
I
am a student of Masters in Fine Art in digital art at University of
Malta. Currently I have been working on my thesis and the project
based on it. The topic of the thesis is Time and Presence and the
project consists of a mix between Performance art and Video art (a
video sample for the project you can find over here :
 <a href=""https://vimeo.com/154039165"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://vimeo.com/154039165</a>) </p>
<p>
My
background in in various art media, but the most used are
photography, video and installation art. Video art has been chosen as
a main medium by this project, as it would fit the concept of being
present in time best. The videos have been filmed and edited already
and are prepared to be shown as a part of group degree exhibition in
Spazju Kreativ in St.James cavalier (contemporary art exhibition
space), Valletta starting from the 6th of May 2016. </p>
<p>
Needless
to say, the organisation of such an event entails certain expenses
such as </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
	logistics
	- building temporary walls and a ceiling in the gallery space to
	separate exhibition areas;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
	advertising
	- printing of booklets, posters, leaflets; </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
	media
	coverage;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
	expenses
	towards the opening night itself - catering and
	photographer's services. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
All
expenses should not exceed 500 per person, which is nonetheless quite
a large amount for a student. </p>
<p>
You,
the contributor will help me and my group to create a good quality
contemporary art event, expose our projects to the viewer, raise
level of contemporary art on the island and share our final projects
in mostly new digital media with the world.</p>
<p>The goal is to reach 500 euro in total, but if the goal isn't reached the money collected would be used for the expenses listed above.</p>
<p>If you can't contribute, please share this page with your social circle.</p>

<h3>Support Our Campaign!</h3>
<p>Hello! We are Gaysper Pins, designers and makers of high-quality enamel pins with Gaysper: The Lovable LGBT Phantom. In early May, we started selling pins with the original Gaysper. But after countless requests from around the world for pins with Bisper, Transper and more, we want to expand our catalog even further! However, offering so many different pins at once is an expensive endeavor. That’s where you can help!</p>
<p>Every contribution brings us closer to offering unique pins for all LGBTIQAP+ identities! For our primary goal, we chose our most requested pins: <strong>Bisper, Transper, Pansper, Enbysper, Acesper and Leathersper</strong>. And as our reach goals succeed, even more will become available.</p>
<p>Your support will not only bring the love of Gaysper to more people, but let you bring home pins of Gaysper’s love too! Our primary goal is $1,400, the initial cost to produce all of the six new pins. We set a fixed goal because we want to fulfill our promise completely, or your money back! To reach our goal, all of our perks offer the new charming pins at a discount.</p>
<p>You can help bring Gaysper to even more people, while enjoying pins for yourself, friends and family. Act now before they return to full price! Please enjoy our campaign, and help support our goal!</p>

<p>Gaysper is based on the “ghost” emoji for Google Android 4.3, released in 2012. In 2015, Spanish creator Baiiley added five pride flags to the emoji, making the famous Gaysper.</p>
<p>Gaysper came to fame in April 2019 after a Spanish far-right group used the rainbow-colored ghost in a rogues’ gallery of their enemies. However, the group’s post backfired, and the little phantom, dubbed “Gaysper” on social media, quickly became an adorable companion of the LGBT community!</p>
<p>Gaysper Pins brings the charm and love of Gaysper, the LGBT phantom, to persons everywhere. We started in April 2019, to help the LGBT community reclaim Gaysper from anti-LGBT voices! As the entire Gaysper Pins team are members of the LGBT community, we are dedicated to fostering a community of love and empowerment for LGBT people worldwide.</p>

<p>Currently I am studying Theatre Education and Production &amp; Design at Central Washington University in the blustery town of Ellensburg. Through this education, I have found an insane obsession with drawing and thankfully, that obsession has found an outlet.</p>
<p>Folklore is something I am immensely passionate about, from my own Celtic folklore to Norse, Germanic, and even to Americana, I want to bring to life the oral stories of our history.All of that aside, you might be wondering why I mentioned my study at CWU and how that connects to this art - well, as a theatre educator, I believe that theatre is the truest form of human connection, and perhaps the closest tie we have to the old ways of life. Live theatre can take many forms, from staged plays, musical performances, spoken word, political protest, and so on, but at it's core it is humans telling stories to other humans. And that, in my opinion, is the core of Folklore and it's importance to our humanity, culture, and existence.</p>
<p>You're probably wondering by now when I'll get to my goals and how indiegogo will help me achieve them. I have, in the past, over committed and underdelivered, so my first step is to keep it simple and achievable.</p>
<p>Indiegogo contributions will go to the following things...</p>
<p>- Establishing a domain name and website with an easily manageable store for people to make purchases from. I have a background in graphic design and already have a website made, it's just a matter of paying the fees of the domain and hosting. (~$160)</p>
<p>- Allow me to more easily purchase the tools (a proper drawing tablet to do digital linework, finding a printer, set-up supplies) I need to create the first Coloring Book in (hopefully) a series of many more.  (A drawing tablet. I will be getting one no matter what, but the sooner, the better!)</p>
<p>- Help me build up a small inventory of prints, original art, and other things for the online store, future conventions, Ren Faires, and local art-walks that I will be exhibiting with.</p>
<p>What will you GET for you contribution?</p>
<p>Well, different levels will get different things, but every person will be given access to discounts on store items, process-shots, videos, and tutorials, as well as the ability to contribute your own ideas and suggestions! All contributors will also be credited in print versions of any Coloring Books created.</p>

Its purpose for me: to awaken emotion and awe in myself and the viewer, something all of us are capable of experiencing if we take the time to see and feel the world around us. ✶ Calendar Details ✶Printed on beautiful linen paper (this is so important to me, however, we have had humidity and paper issues in the past that have required me to change the stock. I am using a printshop that I've had a wonderful working relationship with for the past 10 years on all of my projects.

<p><strong>An American Black Photographer N Greece - Overview</strong></p>
<p>“An American Black Photographer N Greece” is a short documentary film that will follow up-and-coming photographer DJ Noj as he visits galleries in Thessaloniki and Athens, Greece (where two of his photos will be featured in exhibits from mid-November to mid-December 2019. One of the exhibitions is even hosted by American film actor Billy Zane).</p>
<p>He’s had  20 photos accepted in gallery exhibits in 9 countries demonstrating more than 15 types of photography in just this year alone, prompting him to want to actually see a show for himself.</p>
<p>This could be the start of a series where DJ Noj visits other countries where his photos are displayed and takes more photos along the way.</p>
<p>This is also an opportunity to show what it’s like to be a Black photographer from America traveling abroad, meeting artists and people, and sharing his art and outlook.</p>

<p>It’s a short documentary film chronicling DJ Noj, an American Black photographer, as he travels overseas to see his art on display in gallery exhibitions (in Greece, this time), and to take more photos and interact with artists and people who may have few instances of connecting with Black Americans. </p>

<p>In November 2019, he’ll have photos in three separate exhibits, two in Spain and one in Greece, and then another one in Greece in December. He’d love to be able to go see them all in person, but since that's a huge expense, Greece is more of a priority. </p>
<p>He started taking pictures in elementary school, really getting into the art again six years ago.

<p>This is the very first year he’s ever even had a passport or been out of the Americas. He was invited as a guest to spend a week in Australia on a tour of various communities of indigenous people and, of course, he took a ton of pictures while he was there.</p>
<p>He couldn’t help but notice that Australians assumed he, too, was indigenous, and were very surprised to find that he was a Black American instead. On his trip he noticed just how few Black people were even getting on any planes. Recently, traveling domestically up the West coast, he noticed the same lack of Black travelers. </p>
<p>So, being a filmmaker, he wants to chronicle his trip to Greece, the very model of Western Democracy, in the form of a documentary of a American Black Photographer experiencing another culture.</p>

<p>The bad news: I don’t have funds to pay for tuition and fees.</p>
<p>I am asking for your help — please!</p>
<p>Why this Master? I love the arts. I was born with this love in my blood. My father was a sculptor and painter. His last request to me, before he passed away after a long battle with cancer, was to encourage me to study art at a great institution. Christie’s has the only Master that combines Art, Law and Business, which I feel will give me the best shot at living my dream.</p>
<p>My hope is that, after completing this master, I will return to Romania to share what I’ve learned and to help in some way, somehow — helping Romanian artists express themselves internationally and exposing people to the healing power of art through youth and hospital programs.</p>
<p>I really love art and I would be more than happy to study there. And it is not because is the single master in the world that combine Art, Law and Business, not because is the single MA in the world that is owned by an auction house for real. Because I love art and I make a promise to my father!</p>
<p>To keep my seat in the class I must pay £1800 / €2016 / $2360 by August 15, 2018. The full Master is £ 36.000 / €40.320 / $ 47.214 divided into installments over the year.</p>
<p>You don’t know me. So your support would be somewhat of a miracle. But miracles happen and, I promise, I would put every dollar you donate to good use. I apologize for my desperation — but I was accepted too late to apply for a scholarship, so this is my best bet.</p>
<p>I want to make art my life — and, in the process, help others do the same.</p>
<p>Please help in any way you can – no matter how large. No matter how small.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance from the bottom of my heart!</p>

<h3>The Collection</h3>
<p>The Jsouv collection features 15 landmarks from New York, London, Berlin, Istanbul, Dubai, Tokyo, and more. Each souvenir is CNC machined from a solid piece of aluminum or brass to ensure quality and precision.</p>
<p>The approximate dimensions of each souvenir is 6x6x6 cm (2.3 x 2.3 x 2.3 inches), and the average weight is 70 grams.</p>

<h3>The Golden Edition</h3>
<p>For those who love really precious things we created the special brass series. Each souvenir of this series is made of solid brass and polished to present a golden shine. They are more weighty in hand weighing approximately 150 grams, and look even more premium.</p>

<h3>The Creation Process</h3>
<p>I have spent the last two years creating the ideal collection from sketching ideas to machining and assembling each souvenir. My goals throughout the process have always been to create a souvenir with the smoothest finish and cleanest lines.</p>
<p><strong>Sketching of Ideas</strong></p>
<p>I started the process with many hand-drawn sketches.  I drew a lot of popular architectural attractions and then selected 15 of them for the first collection.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1489657423/e9ybgdndctrpheiw7e3o.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/> </p>
<p><strong>First Pre-Prototypes</strong></p>
<p>The first prototypes were made of plasticine. This enabled me to determine the optimal size of the products.</p>

<p><strong>3D Modeling &amp; Engineering of Drawings</strong></p>
<p>The next step was a long process and involved 3D modeling and the development of engineering drawings.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1489657518/fdzynbxyz7vri3b9ffbu.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p><strong>Production of Samples</strong></p>
<p>In the development process, I experimented with different shapes, materials, and production technologies in order to achieve the ideal proportions and surface quality of the souvenirs.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1489657570/cwglwkrhohdvkhi48bnt.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>The two methods that we used to produce the final samples are casting into a gypsum mold and direct CNC machining of metal. Many-axis CNC metal processing is an expensive method, but it allowed us to achieve the highest surface quality and create a unique product in small editions.<br/> </p>
<p>To complete the souvenir, I used a laser to engrave the base with the 2D emblem of the city landmark and neodymium magnets to secure the souvenir to the base.</p>
<p>I experimented with different kinds of wood for the base to find the perfect shade, and I tested a number of different magnets to provide a strong, delicate coupling.</p>
<p>The magnets enable the souvenir to be experienced by itself or with the base to create a different type of display.</p>

<p><i>Alex Odincov, 29, founder of Studio66Designs</i></p>
<p>Since 2012 working as a low-poly 3D artist, once being in search of inspiration came across a post on Pinterest about <strong>papercraft</strong>. That was amazing! That is what can bring to life 3D models (without having 3D printer of course). Being a fan of the Star Wars universe decided to implement a long-standing plan - to create a sculpture made of paper of his own vision, so was born the First Order Stormtrooper, and then Darth Vader. In the plans to create a whole line of sculptures such as Boba Fett, Imperial Stormtrooper, C-3PO, etc.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Darth Vader Papercraft Bust</h3>
<p><strong>Darth Vader</strong> doesn't need to be represented, for sure there is no one person who wouldn't have heard or seen him at least once. Now you can make your own, using paper, cardstock or even recycled paper. Recommended to use <i>at least</i>  <strong>160g/sq.m</strong> paper, better <strong>220g/sq.m</strong></p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">But what is papercraft?</h3>
<p>The most accurate description that comes to mind - <strong>3D Puzzle</strong>.</p>
<p><i>As Wikipedia says</i>: <strong>Papercraft</strong> - is the collection of art forms employing paper or card as the primary artistic medium for the creation of three-dimensional objects. It is the most widely used material in arts and crafts. It lends itself to a wide range of techniques, as it can for instance be folded, cut, glued, molded, stitched, or layered.</p>

<li><p>Cutting mat (where you can cut paper, without harming your table) <i>Also you will need a nonworking pen or something similar to score the edges.</i></p></li>
<li>And strange as it may sound - Paper - (I recommend to use at least <strong>160g/sq.m</strong> paper, better <strong>220g/sq.m</strong>)<strong> </strong><i>Since patterns goes blank you can use both colored paper and white (and then paint it)​</i>

<p>Seems nothing difficult, but in fact you need one more thing - <strong>Pattern</strong>! So here we are!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>ArtPrt, launched in 2018 year, has already site - artprt.com, Instagram page (art.a.part) and 41 freelancer! We are a totally self supported platform, trying to create fair wages and a safe working environment for freelancers around the world. Our technology is simple to use, mobile adaptive! ArtPrt have no charges any for freelancer! We help them.</p>
<p>At the moment we have sections: logo design, portraits by photo, audio section, business card design, t-shirt design, package design and create a new service.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are looking for funds to complete one or both of these some features:</p>
<p>1. CREATE A SECTION ""DO IT BY YOURSELF"".</p>
<p>The peculiarity of this section will be the online designing of any service for a very low cost. For example: a person needs to make a logo. Instead of ordering it from a freelancer for $ 10, he can make it himself in a special designer for only $ 2. At the same time, the logo will not look awful, we have our own logo creation system based on the interests of clients in different business niches. The creation of the system costs $ 350. The creation of systems will take our own freelancers Nick Lavetsky and Tian Tao.</p>
<p>2. UNIQUE COLLABORATION SYSTEMS: EMPLOYEE-STAFF, STAFF-CUSTOMER (CREATIVE SPACE).</p>
<p>Often, several people are required to perform complex tasks (computation, coding, 3d graphics, animation, music). To do this, this system will be made, which is a cabinet with a mindmaps, a chat with a file transfer and many convenient functions.</p>
<p>3. LOGIN-PASSWORD SYSTEM, SCORE SYSTEM, CHAT.</p>
<p>We need a mandatory login-password system for the visitor and freelancer (cost of creation, implementation, testing - $ 500), a system of accumulating points when buying on the site ($ 200) and a chat system for visitors and freelancers ($ 110). The creation of systems will take our own freelancers Nick Lavetsky and Tian Tao, programmers with a lot of experience. Why hire when you have yours? :)</p>
<p>4. SECTION ""PHYSICAL SERVICES"".<br/>We want to add a section of physical services to the site. Customers want, for example, to get a carpet cleaned or walk a dog, put up their inquiry and wait for the performer. The creation of this section is almost the creation of a new site and costs $ 200.</p>
<p>5. ADVERTISING IN ADWORDS, SOCIAL NETWORKS, INTERNET IMPRESSIONS.</p>
<p>Of course, we need to grow, so a small part of the money will be invested in advertising the service. How to attract attention without advertising? It will be engaged in our PR manager - Kate. The amount of expenses is 230 $ (Adword, Yandex Ad, Social Networks, publications).</p>
<p>And of course, we help freelancers to find means of subsistence, the meaning of life, a career. This is also a very important task!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The main goal is to provide work to professionals who have remained without a permanent job. Losing money leads to loss of life and health!</p>
<p>Creating a ""DO IT BY YOURSELF"" section will help people who have so many tasks (draw hundreds of portraits or make many logos) to save, and enterprising people to earn money.</p>
<p>""UNIQUE COLLABORATION SYSTEM"" will speed up the work and make life easier for both parties.</p>
<p>LOGIN-PASSWORD SYSTEM, SCORE SYSTEM, CHAT will add the necessary conditions for the learning of the site by the client and freelancer.</p>
<p>ADVERTISING help to find the face of the company and give work.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Our site will continue to exist because, he also brings bread to me, not only to other freelancers, I'm a freelancer. You can also check the functions of the site in the course of time.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We are only asking for a $1-5 contribution! There is strength in numbers and we are a growing community.  If you can't contribute financially, please spread the word about ArtPrt. </p>

4. SECTION ""PHYSICAL SERVICES"".We want to add a section of physical services to the site. Customers want, for example, to get a carpet cleaned or walk a dog, put up their inquiry and wait for the performer. The creation of this section is almost the creation of a new site and costs $ 200.
5. ADVERTISING IN ADWORDS, SOCIAL NETWORKS, INTERNET IMPRESSIONS.
Of course, we need to grow, so a small part of the money will be invested in advertising the service. How to attract attention without advertising? It will be engaged in our PR manager - Kate. The amount of expenses is 230 $ (Adword, Yandex Ad, Social Networks, publications).
And of course, we help freelancers to find means of subsistence, the meaning of life, a career. This is also a very important task!

The Impact
The main goal is to provide work to professionals who have remained without a permanent job. Losing money leads to loss of life and health!
Creating a ""DO IT BY YOURSELF"" section will help people who have so many tasks (draw hundreds of portraits or make many logos) to save, and enterprising people to earn money.
""UNIQUE COLLABORATION SYSTEM"" will speed up the work and make life easier for both parties.
LOGIN-PASSWORD SYSTEM, SCORE SYSTEM, CHAT will add the necessary conditions for the learning of the site by the client and freelancer.
ADVERTISING help to find the face of the company and give work.

Risks & Challenges
Our site will continue to exist because, he also brings bread to me, not only to other freelancers, I'm a freelancer. You can also check the functions of the site in the course of time.

<p>About the Artist:</p>
<p>Kelley Anderson is an artist based in Los Angeles who has been working with plants and natural materials since childhood. Drawing on her meditative practice and the woods of her native Connecticut, her work is intended to inspire and connect people back to nature. Her work has been featured at SXSW, TED talks, WE  RISE LA, Forbes, West Elm, Create &amp; Cultivate, and in various architectural installations around the globe.</p>
<p>‘ I think of my botanical art as a window into the harmony of the natural world. I want people to feel and experience that joy, love, and divinity that can be seen so clearly in nature.’-Kelley Anderson</p>
<p>Fraktel is my next large scale experiential installation that is intended to support people's internal emotional state. The installation immerses people within a controlled multi-sesory environment, that leads them to journey within themselves, connecting to their inner self, and to nature, eliciting feeling of awe, joy and peace. </p>
<p>My vision is to heal people through immersive environmental art, and to touch thousands and thousands of hearts across the globe.</p>
<p>Fraktel's team is composed of 10 volunteers from a structural engineer and architect, to contractors, life coaches and therapists. We need your support to raise the fund to cover the cost of the materials to build Fraktel and all our sweat, tears and Love will go to build it!</p>
<p>We get to raise $12,000 to cover the materials to build the structure and to transport it to and from BRC, NV.  Any additional funds we will receive will go to support Fraktel's fall tour and get it out into the world for more people to experience.</p>
<p>Risks and Challenges: getting any art work to the playa is challenging work but we are 100% committed to getting it there any way we can! With your support to fund the materials, you will ensure this dream becomes a reality and touches the hearts of thousands!</p>

<p>The Macte Art project is aimed at supporting emerging artists working across different genres and media. As females, we know how challenging it may be to navigate the art world and pass the gatekeepers. As immigrants, we know that finding a place for you and your art in a foreign country requires ruthless energy and determination. And as artists, we know it is hard enough to find your way, find representation and showcase your work.</p>
<p>We create the Macte Art space to address all of these issues. We want to create a safe space for artists from countries, where freedom of expression is politically oppressed or stigmatised by the conservative society, and religion. We also aim to support local artists from Barcelona and to facilitate the connection among the local art scene and the international art communities. Finally, we are eager to give emerging artists, especially females and LGBTQI, a voice and strength to express themselves through art. As we realise the cultural sensitivities at play, we will make sure that each artist, regardless of the gender, sexual orientation, religion or origin feels safe, free to create and welcome by others in our artistic residency.</p>
<p>We are going to create a bespoke educational programme for collectors to guide them through new ways to understand art and political and sexual context underlying it.</p>
<h3>What we need...</h3>

<p>We have already prepared the physical space and set up a company according to the Spanish law. We’re currently building our website, setting the programme for the residence and making research for our first exhibitions.

<li>Space lease</li>
<li>Artistic residency, materials, teachers and speakers salary</li>
<li>New website  </li>

<h3>Hey, I'm Krystle Brown</h3>
<p>I'm a visual artist living in working in Boston for the past decade and a lifelong New Englander. Recently, I completed my Master's of Fine Arts degree at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts at Tufts University. While I was in school, I was the curator of the first year exhibition, ""defunthisshow"", was a recipient of the Montague Travel Grant to conduct research in Northern Ireland, and was awarded the Katherine Romero Graduating Student Award. Since this May, I have been in numerous exhibitions, including the Webster Court Project in Newton MA, where I was Co-Curator. I also was an artist in residence at Lazuli Residency in Corinth Vermont this past September, which was a very transformative experience. Basically, I have been a very busy gal.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Then whoa...I got into <i>another</i> residency!</h3>
<p>Two weeks ago, I got the news that I was accepted to attend the <a href=""https://vermontstudiocenter.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Vermont Studio Center</a> for this coming February. This is an excellent opportunity for an emerging or established artist alike. Artist residencies like Vermont Studio Center give artists time and space to develop their projects and connect artists together from across the globe that may never be able to meet otherwise. Residencies are a gateway for future collaborations, exhibitions, and grant funding. If you are a visual artist, then being an artist in residence shows that you are serious about your work, and others will notice that. In short, it is an absolute privilege to go somewhere like Vermont Studio Center, and sadly, many artists do not get this amazing chance.</p>
<p>To help defray the cost of going, I was awarded the VSC Grant and the Community Service Award, totaling in $1,650 of financial aid. The rest of the cost is up to me to come up with, a nice sum of <strong>$2,300</strong>. That is just to go, however, I will also need money for: </p>
<p style=""text-align: right;"">                           February Rent for my Studio and Apartment plus utilities: Roughly $900</p>
<p style=""text-align: right;"">                           Some way to make up for a month of no income: $700</p>
<p style=""text-align: right;"">                           Transportation and other materials: $100</p>
<p>Overall, I would need to raise <strong>$4,000</strong> to be able to attend VSC and not be financially in trouble. This is where I am asking you, friends, family, art supporters, for any amount you are willing to give to help me achieve this dream!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What you can get in return:</h3>
<p>Well first and foremost, my undying gratitude. Seriously! Being a working artist in a society that isn't always as supportive of the arts is hard work, but I am here and I'm doing it!</p>
<p>But Christmas is coming up and I have quite a few photographs, paintings, and drawings that would love new homes. So you would be helping an artist and get the chance to score some art, while also clearing up space in my apartment? That's a triple win situation right there, better get on it!</p>
<p>You will be able to select a piece when you choose to donate. I will be updating this page regularly with photos of the work (I have quite a few pieces). Photographs will be in editions of five and the sizing of everything will be noted.</p>
<p>In addition to the selling of original artwork, I will be offering a private cake decorating classes at Oakleaf Cakes. This would be one on one class with me in either Buttercream Basics or Fun with Fondant, in which you would come home with a 5"" cake that you have decorated with my guidance! Just please note that this class would need to be set up at least a week ahead of time and on a weekday evening, so that way I can plan and have space in the bakery.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There aren't any risks involved with supporting this campaign. You will be helping an emerging artist go to a very well known and sought after residency. My biggest challenge is just to raise this large sum of money before February.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you don't have the cash to spare, you can always spread the word! Maybe someone in your extended network would love to support the arts more and some of the best ways to do that is by direct giving, such as this campaign!</p>

This includes using eco-friendly soya candles and wicks :-) and we will be making the candles in both lavender and lemon grass scents.Our candle refills are simple to use: once the candle has burnt either wash it by hand or use a dishwasher (always remove the remaining wax with warm water before placing it in the dishwasher). Our online video shows how to do this! Tea LightI am also offering this porcelain tea light to those who wish to support this project outside of the subscription. These beautiful objects are made in a similar way to the translucent holders and are finished in glaze as well as gold. A bit more detail on how we make our porcelain candle holders and candles:– The porcelain is sourced in Stoke-on-Trent– We only use real gold in the finishes– Our wicks are eco-friendly and made of cotton– We only use 100% natural Norfolk distilled pure essential oil– The candles are made from sustainable, renewable plant-based wax– Which contains no herbicides or pesticides and is biodegradable– Non-toxic. Burns for around 25-30 hours (initial candle) and 15-20 hours (each refill)– Dimensions: 7cm x 9cm.",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Grace and I - and our school - have had a lot of exposure in the papers, on the radio, and online because we did the original drawings for Anthony's charity children's book, <strong>""<a href=""https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07N96NL47"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Charlie, The Migrating Snail</a>""</strong>, so we decided to give other children the opportunity to do the illustrations for Book Three which will be published next year. The thing is we need a website to run the painting competition and get the message out to showcase all the entries.</p>
<p>We've raised a lot of money for charity with Book One so far, and are helping the <strong>homeless</strong>, helping buy school supplies for <strong>underprivileged school children</strong>, and have even helped out a <strong>widows and orphans center in Africa</strong>, and with Book Two coming later this year we want to sponsor and name a <strong>Guide Dog</strong>! But we need your help and support.</p>
<h3><strong>WHY?</strong></h3>
<p>We believe that giving back to the community you live in and <strong>helping those less fortunate than you is the right thing to do</strong>. Not only that, but it feels really good to just do the right thing. We don't want to be artists, we're both studying business and want to eventually work full time when we leave school for <strong>Charlie's Causes</strong>, the Social Enterprise behind the <a href=""https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07N96NL47"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">""Charlie, The Migrating Snail""</a> series of books. That's why we want to give kids that love art and want to become artists and illustrators a chance at fame and exposure by entering <strong>Charlie's GREAT Painting Competition</strong>.</p>
<h3><strong>HOW?</strong></h3>
<p>We want to create a website and run a worldwide painting competition for children sixteen and under to discover the next great, young illustrators for Book Three. We've found a brilliant web designer, but it's going to cost us  £6,000, because there's a lot of hi-tech stuff that needs to work behind the scenes! We have some of that raised already, but we'd rather that money go to charitable causes instead, so we're reaching out to you! We've set our initial target low (£500) as we'd like to at least get some money in, and we only get the money, if we reach our target.</p>
<h3><strong>WHAT?</strong></h3>
<p>Our web designer is great and has broken our project into two phases to help spread the cost, but we need to give them £1,500 in order to start work. The first phase will allow people to pre-register for the competition and allow us to generate some more income to pay the whole cost for phase one and hopefully fund phase two as well. It is our hope that this will not only generate a lot more revenue for us to donate to worthy causes, but also help spread the word about our book and our work. We're independently published, so we don't have a big publisher with deep pockets funding us, we have done all this ourselves (with the help of Aimee's Mum, Lisa, and Anthony!)</p>
<h3><strong>WHAT'S IN IT FOR YOU?</strong></h3>
<p>As if feeling great about helping our cause wasn't enough, we've got some amazing perks lined up for all those that do help support us. We have great little perks for those that can only afford to pledge a small amount, all the way up to corporate perks at the high end, where you'll get a year-long advertisement on our competition website! And even if you can't afford to pledge anything, if you just share our campaign on social media to help get the word out we'll send you an MP3 reading of Book One by the author, Anthony James Donnelly. <i><strong>So, come on, what are you waiting for... please help us hit our pledge target :)</strong></i></p>
<h3><strong>CHARLIE, THE MIGRATING SNAIL</strong></h3>

the Apus system across the galaxy to discover new worlds. An accidental 
hero, Gorden leads his team into danger as they race against time to 
discover new star systems and planets worthy of calling home. Along 
their journey they discover several of the star systems they visit are 
closer to the brink of extinction than their own. While few star systems
 have been evacuated, others are nothing more than wastelands. Gorden

<h2>3D Printing Material </h2>These models are made from 3D printed sandstone. Sandstone is the only material capable of full-color 3D prints. Produced on Z-Corp printers, it is perfect for figurines, life-like models, avatars, and other products that lend themselves to colorful, high-quality printing. Models are created by printing binder material and colored ink layer-by-layer into a bed of gypsum-based powder. After printing, the models are finished with a cyanoacrylate (super glue) sealant to ensure durability and vivid colors. The final product is a hard, brittle material that works great for figurines and visual models.

<p>Hi there! My name is Cody Schroder. I am a professional 2D artist 
currently Art Directing in mobile games. I have worked professionally 
for many years on many different projects in all kinds of styles and 
platforms. I whole heartedly enjoy what I do, but I think every artist 
has a deep desire to freely express their creativity in their own form. 
With this Explorers project, I feel I have been able to do that.</p>
<p>I have been driven to continue 
expanding on the Explorers universe. It has really become something 
enjoyable and unique. With much positive feedback it seemed only natural
 to seek new avenues to apply these creations. And what better way to 
utilize Explorers than creating collectible figurines from the cast of 
characters that have been designed. With your help, we can make this 
possible. We can bring Explorers to life!</p>
<p>To do this we are asking for your help in raising the necessary funds
 to attain the goal of $5900. With the success of this campaign we will not only be able to create our first character but also be able to dive further into the cast. Can't contribute? No worries! There are other ways you can help out. Feel free to spread the word about this campaign to others with social media websites like Facebook and the Indiegogo share tools! Let's make this happen!</p>

I am sure all of you know people turned off by the images of suffering animals, that don’t go into animal shelters because they don’t want to be reminded of the horrible situation we have with destroying healthy, loving, purposeful animals.

Being pre-armed with the Knowledge to handle these situations will make you an expert, someone who is a resource on this topic. You will be believed, and will change minds, while providing the passerby or friend with a good laugh. It has been proven that people learn better when they are in a higher vibrational space. It is a win-win.

It can’t be sugar coated or glossed over. What the GotBalls? products create is an opening. The chance to HAVE a conversation instead of having an immediate NO. What we need to promote is the vision of a world where no animal dies unnecessarily. That they get to share their gifts they came to bring to the world. In this time of change and turmoil, animals bring a loving stable vibration to the planet. By choosing No-Kill, the choice is being made for love. That a cat will be able to console a teenager when she didn’t get a prom date, a dog will be able to help a disabled person make their way in the world easier. These gifts are simple, and yet utterly profound.</p><h3>Why this is important to me</h3><p><i>“The vital function that pets fulfill in this world hasn’t been fully recognized. They keep millions of people sane.” Eckart Tolle</i></p><p>I see the difference cats and dogs make in their owners lives every day. That these animals who can add so much to our world are being DESTROYED is a travesty. It speaks to a society who has their priorities out of balance. If we save pets, it is a step on the way to recognizing them sentient beings, of valuing them as they should be. When ALL animals are treasured and accepted as beings that improve the world on the whole, every person will be more valued also. Saving animals raises all boats. It makes us better humans.</p><h3>The Outcome</h3><p>This program is meant to change the world for both people and shelter animals. To concisely explain what is wrong about killing shelter animals and convince people of this is empowering. People will take action if they know they can affect real change. Everything will change with these steps.</p><p>I have excelled at every goal I have set my mind to, from 2 World Championships with my horses, my 4th degree black belt in TaeKwonDo, to consistently being in the top 10% in the sales force I was in, regardless of the product I sold or the market I was in. But that stuff wasn’t as important as saving animals LIVES! This is my life’s work!</p><p>I will also come and speak at any shelter or rescue that is within driving distance to discuss animal communication, how pets see humans, and the no-kill solution. ANYTHING to market the campaign.</p><h3>The MONEY</h3><p>I am raising money to get the business off the ground, and to support No-Kill Pima County. 50% of the profits raised will be used to create the company that keeps “GotBalls4Pets?”items available in the future. This includes promoting the GotBalls4Pets? National PR campaign.   The other 50% is going to No-Kill Pima County for them to use as they see fit.</p><p>I have a lot already invested in making the artwork, having it photographed, my current website, AnnHoff.com. I want to be able to keep this business separate from my own website, and always donating 50% of profits to the No-Kill movement.</p><p>Professional photos of Samson and artwork: $2000</p><p>Trademarking the GotBalls4Pets? Program and artwork $4000</p><p>Professional PR campaign for 4 months: $6000 ($1,500 per month).</p><p>Samson &amp; I attending conferences (Global Pet, BlogPaws, Bark World, Super Zoo) to promote program: $3000- $5000.</p><p>New Website with Woo Commerce store: $1500.</p><p>This is a lifelong dream for me, that all animals are safe from being killed needlessly because of overpopulation. I have always wanted my artwork to be enjoyed by fellow pet lovers. This program creates a continuing revenue for no-kill and to grow the business. OF course, I will keep everyone up to date and also create more paintings &amp; other items when I get input from donors.</p><p>Risks and Challenges:</p><p>I have a big vision for this program. I know I am asking for a lot of money, but it is the bare minimum I need to have this be successful. The program is meant to be nationwide if not world wide: the people in Boston should know about the GotBalls4Pets? Just as much as the people in Phoenix. I personally can’t do that without this campaign, because of the money it would take to have a national campaign.</p><p> That is why I am doing IndieGoGo. It brings the campaign more exposure. I can get more Brand Awareness on social media. However, there is nothing that replaces meeting people, looking them in the eye and telling them how passionate you are about your program.  I am also an excellent blogger, and I will follow up this campaign with blog posts and articles. I will look at every avenue available to get GotBalls? into as many consciousness’s as possible. I am counting on the people I know and the people I have yet to meet to help me achieve this. When I have an unforeseen problem, I will discuss it with the investors, talk to business people I admire and brainstorm to find the exact unique solution. Thru the years in Pharmaceutical Sales I learned not to panic, stay grounded, and move forward, and continue with eyes on the goal.</p><p><strong>Other ways you can help:</strong></p><p>If you can’t donate, please post this campaign on your social media. Tell a friend or relative that you know would be excited about GotBalls4Pets? The Perks are going to be ready before Christmas, so they buy 1 for a pet loving friend!  Can you post a flyer on GotBallsForPets? At your business? A store you go to?  Any of this would be appreciated!</p><p>Remember you can also use the IndieGoGo share tools to promote this campaign too!</p><p>Thanks to everyone  who has loved &amp; adopted a rescue pet! You are part of the solution!</p></div>","I am Ann Marie Hoff, an artist, animal communicator & intuitive medium.

It is a win-win. Seeing these animals in a positive light, as something that brings love and joy into a person’s life willWe shouldn’t sugar-coat the killing of more than 9000 pets in shelters every single day- Francis BattistaThe reality of the situation in kill shelters is harsh. It can’t be sugar coated or glossed over. What the GotBalls? products create is an opening. The chance to HAVE a conversation instead of having an immediate NO. What we need to promote is the vision of a world where no animal dies unnecessarily. That they get to share their gifts they came to bring to the world. In this time of change and turmoil, animals bring a loving stable vibration to the planet. By choosing No-Kill, the choice is being made for love. That a cat will be able to console a teenager when she didn’t get a prom date, a dog will be able to help a disabled person make their way in the world easier. These gifts are simple, and yet utterly profound.Why this is important to me“The vital function that pets fulfill in this world hasn’t been fully recognized. They keep millions of people sane.” Eckart TolleI see the difference cats and dogs make in their owners lives every day. That these animals who can add so much to our world are being DESTROYED is a travesty. It speaks to a society who has their priorities out of balance. If we save pets, it is a step on the way to recognizing them sentient beings, of valuing them as they should be. When ALL animals are treasured and accepted as beings that improve the world on the whole, every person will be more valued also. Saving animals raises all boats. It makes us better humans.The OutcomeThis program is meant to change the world for both people and shelter animals. To concisely explain what is wrong about killing shelter animals and convince people of this is empowering. People will take action if they know they can affect real change. Everything will change with these steps.I have excelled at every goal I have set my mind to, from 2 World Championships with my horses, my 4th degree black belt in TaeKwonDo, to consistently being in the top 10% in the sales force I was in, regardless of the product I sold or the market I was in. But that stuff wasn’t as important as saving animals LIVES! This is my life’s work!I will also come and speak at any shelter or rescue that is within driving distance to discuss animal communication, how pets see humans, and the no-kill solution. ANYTHING to market the campaign.The MONEYI am raising money to get the business off the ground, and to support No-Kill Pima County. 50% of the profits raised will be used to create the company that keeps “GotBalls4Pets?”items available in the future. This includes promoting the GotBalls4Pets? National PR campaign.   The other 50% is going to No-Kill Pima County for them to use as they see fit.I have a lot already invested in making the artwork, having it photographed, my current website, AnnHoff.com. I want to be able to keep this business separate from my own website, and always donating 50% of profits to the No-Kill movement.Professional photos of Samson and artwork: $2000Trademarking the GotBalls4Pets? Program and artwork $4000Professional PR campaign for 4 months: $6000 ($1,500 per month).Samson & I attending conferences (Global Pet, BlogPaws, Bark World, Super Zoo) to promote program: $3000- $5000.New Website with Woo Commerce store: $1500.This is a lifelong dream for me, that all animals are safe from being killed needlessly because of overpopulation. I have always wanted my artwork to be enjoyed by fellow pet lovers. This program creates a continuing revenue for no-kill and to grow the business. OF course, I will keep everyone up to date and also create more paintings & other items when I get input from donors.Risks and Challenges:I have a big vision for this program. I know I am asking for a lot of money, but it is the bare minimum I need to have this be successful. The program is meant to be nationwide if not world wide: the people in Boston should know about the GotBalls4Pets? Just as much as the people in Phoenix. I personally can’t do that without this campaign, because of the money it would take to have a national campaign. That is why I am doing IndieGoGo. It brings the campaign more exposure. I can get more Brand Awareness on social media. However, there is nothing that replaces meeting people, looking them in the eye and telling them how passionate you are about your program.  I am also an excellent blogger, and I will follow up this campaign with blog posts and articles. I will look at every avenue available to get GotBalls? into as many consciousness’s as possible. I am counting on the people I know and the people I have yet to meet to help me achieve this. When I have an unforeseen problem, I will discuss it with the investors, talk to business people I admire and brainstorm to find the exact unique solution. Thru the years in Pharmaceutical Sales I learned not to panic, stay grounded, and move forward, and continue with eyes on the goal.Other ways you can help:If you can’t donate, please post this campaign on your social media. Tell a friend or relative that you know would be excited about GotBalls4Pets? The Perks are going to be ready before Christmas, so they buy 1 for a pet loving friend!  Can you post a flyer on GotBallsForPets? At your business? A store you go to?  Any of this would be appreciated!Remember you can also use the IndieGoGo share tools to promote this campaign too!Thanks to everyone  who has loved & adopted a rescue pet! You are part of the solution!",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>The Story</h3>
<p>When you walk into a home, you don't comment on the IKEA couch (no offense, IKEA).  Your eye is instantly drawn to the different.  To the piece that has quirks: a pop of color, a texture that emerges from the background, style that has character.  In essence, I want to give you a story to tell your friends and family.  It is a passion of mine to find the forgotten and left behind pieces and breathe new life into them.  I take what someone else wouldn't give a second look and make it a part of your home that you'll love and pass on. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>A Need for Healthy (and Affordable) Nostalgia</h3>
<p>It's not easy for the average person to be able to acquire antiques or quality home decor pieces.  ""Found"" pieces and specialty items are sold at huge markups in retailers and few people can make the time to not only seek out these items, but also refurbish and re-purpose them for personal use.  We all deserve beauty in our homes; this is where we go to recharge, to engage with loved ones, and to express our honest selves.  I want to share my eye for character and charm with those who simply don't have the luxury of time to do it themselves.  And I want to do this at an affordable price.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What Your Funding Will Do</h3>
<ul>
<li>Provide the startup costs of building a proper website to showcase and bring my business to a wide market</li>
<li>Enable me to buy the best materials and tools for refurbishing </li>
<li>Give me the opportunity to buy the finds as I find them vs. when I can afford them, thus allowing me to grow my original inventory</li>
<li>Fund marketing through social media and various platforms to get my message to a wider audience</li>
<li>Cover some upfront shipping supply costs</li>
<li>Allow me to pay for further technical training in my field (refurbishing, upholstering, woodworking, etc.)</li>
<li>Solidify my confidence that I can make my passion a career (something I didn't let myself consider for most of my life)</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>A Risk and a Reward</h3>
<p>I'm very aware that all small businesses are a risk.  But coming from the cynic who always said she just wanted a job that she at least didn't hate, I can assure you that this has 100% of my passion and energy.  It has taken me years of searching to find something that would motivate me to work endless hours, skip a meal (I didn't think people actually did this voluntarily), and take a risk on.  But I know this: I have a Masters in Art History, five years of experience in merchandising and visual display, and a lifetime love of all things creative behind me.  I want to make people happy with what makes me happy; that's the dream.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you don't have the ability to help financially, lend a hand by spreading the word about my mission.  Tell that friend who still has his college dorm room posters thumbtacked to the wall.  Tell your uber busy professional friend who knows her aesthetic but simply can't take a lunch break to go thrifting.  Tell your mom. </p>

<h3><strong>Emergence of the Feminine</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Crystalis</strong> will be a featured exhibit at the Portland Winter Light Festival in Portland, Oregon. Now in its 5th year, the Festival draws over 150,000 visitors. One hundred exhibits will display cutting-edge art and technology throughout the city, brightening Portland’s winter nights.</p>
<p><strong>Crystalis</strong>, developed by Eichinger Sculpture Studio and Koble Creative, creates a magical illusion through multiple projectors focused on a central pod. Synchronized images projected onto and through the pod’s translucent panels produce a mesmerizing effect visible from 360 degrees. Viewers walk around the display as the images dance and tumble within the projection chamber.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Last year’s introduction of Crystalis at the Festival was self-funded through contributions of the partners, vendors, borrowed equipment and hundreds of volunteer hours. Our goal this year is to purchase the processor, projectors, speakers, animation, programming, video editing and production services. Funds will allow us to upgrade our light sculpture and also take it to other festivals. Making our creative production available to wider audiences depends on financial support from people like you.</p>
<p>Our funding goal is $7,500 to purchase a processor, 3 projectors, 2 speakers, expanded animation and video production services. This will be more than matched by volunteer hours of our combined staffs.</p>
<p>$25 - Set of coasters and  weekly progress report (via email)</p>
<p>$50 - Attend our Wrap Party plus items above</p>
<p>$100 - Visit studio while work is in progress plus items above</p>
<p>$500 - Pair of etched ""Crystalis"" wine glasses plus items above</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What motivates us</h3>
<p>For over 40 years, Eichinger Sculpture Studio has created sculptural experiences, whether in traditional, figurative bronzes, science-based projects, and now electronic installations. Martin Eichinger’s philosophy is that sculpture should be a dialogue that captures the viewer’s curiosity. Koble Creative, emphasize an integrated team-oriented approach within their architectural practice. Through imaginative use of space and materials, they create structures that enable creative people to function more effectively and comfortably. Collectively, Koble Creative and  Eichinger Sculpture Studio engage festival participants  in the power of collaboration.</p>
<p>The 5th annual Portland Winter Light Festival is a city-wide event on February 6-8, 2020. It showcases illuminated art installations, vibrant performances, and kinetic fire sculptures. The festival will be held in several locations at the eastern foot of the Tilikum Crossing Bridge, the west side waterfront, and other locations throughout the city.  </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>

 Ce projet est tout d'abord notre stage pré-professionnel, c'est à dire 
notre dernier stage de dernière année en tant qu'étudiants infirmiers. 
Il a donc pour but de nous responsabiliser et de prouver nos capacités à
 nous même mais également aux professionnels et aux patients qui nous 
entourent.</p>
<p><strong>VIETNAM:</strong> Ce magnifique pays que nous 
avons choisit pour effectuer ce stage. Son mode de vie, sa culture, ses 
traditions mais également son système de santé qui diffère tellement du 
notre. </p>
<p><strong>EXPERIENCE:</strong> Ce stage nous fera grandir en
 tant que personnes mais également en tant que professionnels de santé. 
Cette expérience restera à jamais un moment clé de notre parcours 
professionnel.</p>
<p>Et enfin...</p>
<p><strong>PASSION:</strong> 
Parceque nous aimons notre métier et que ce projet sera pour nous le 
passage du monde des études au monde professionnel. Nous pourrons enfin 
vivre de notre passion: prendre soins d'autrui.</p>
<p><u><strong>NOTRE STAGE:</strong></u></p>
<p><br/>
Nous partons grâce à l'association Missions Stages. Nous serons hébergés
 à l'orphelinat de Hoa Mai et nous effectuerons notre stage à l'hôtipal 
de Long Thanh (à mi-chemin entre la mer de Chine et la ville 
d'Hochiminh). Grâce à vous nous partirons du 18 avril au 27 mai 2016.<br/>
                                                         </p>
<p><br/>
Mais tout cela a un coût et c'est pour cela que nous avons besoin de votre générosité..</p>

                    A quoi va servir le financement ?
                </h3><section><p>Ce financement a pour but de nous aider à financer notre stage.</p>
<p>Détail par personne: <br/>
- 1060€ pour l'association (prise en charge sur le lieu de stage, 
l'hébergement, la nourriture, les transports et l' interprète 
francophone) <br/>
- Billets d'avions : environ 500€<br/>
- Frais divers : passeport, Visa, vaccins... : environ 150€</p>
<p>Mais 
vos dons servirons également à financer du matériel médical (gants à 
usage unique, charlottes, surblouses,...), du matériel pour les actions 
de préventions que nous comptons mettre en place au sein de l'orphelinat
 (hygiène bucco-dentaire, hygiène des mains,...). </p>
<p>Si nous arrivons à récolter plus que ce que nous espérons, les fonds restants seront reversés à l'orphelinat Hoa Mai. </p>
<p>C'est pour cela que même si notre objectif est atteint, continuez de partager et de parler de notre projet ! </p>

<p>Nous
 sommes Alexis, Melissa, Grégoire, Chloé, Florent et Emeline, 6 
étudiants infirmiers à l'IFSI (Institut en soins infirmiers) de 
Montereau (77).</p>
<p>Et dans 1 an nous partons pour le Vietnam pour réaliser un de nos rêve: effectuer un stage humanitaire ! </p>
<p>                                   </p>
<p><u><strong>NOS MOTIVATIONS:</strong></u></p>
<p>Ce
 projet serait pour nous l'accomplissement de nos 3 années d'études. 
Nous partageons un rêve commun et celui-ci peut devenir réalité grâce à 
vous, vos dons, votre générosité.</p>
<p>Ce stage serait pour nous un 
moyen d'accroître nos connaissances et de découvrir le Vietnam sous nos 
yeux de soignants. En effet, le système de santé vietnamien diffère 
totalement du système de santé français. Les professionnels fonctionnent
 différemment et travaillent avec les seuls moyens dont ils disposent. 
Nous découvrirons la prise en charge de patients ayant un mode de vie, 
des coutumes et des traditions que nous n'avons jamais pu rencontrer 
dans le cadre de notre formation.</p>
<p>Cette aventure nous sera 
bénéfique, car la barrière de la langue nous amènera à accentuer nos 
efforts sur la construction d'une relation de confiance due à chaque 
patient. Il faudra pour cela faire favoriser la communication non 
verbale et adapter notre attitude afin que le patient soit rassuré quant
 à sa prise en charge.</p>
<p>Nous avons également comme objectif de 
sensibiliser les enfants de l'orphelinat de Hoa Mai à l'hygiène 
bucco-dentaire ainsi qu'à l'hygiène des mains afin qu'ils acquièrent une
 meilleure hygiène de vie.</p>
<p>Grâce à vous nous pourrions atteindre nos objectifs. Nous sortirons enrichit de cette expérience hors du commun !</p>

notre dernier stage de dernière année en tant qu'étudiants infirmiers. 
Il a donc pour but de nous responsabiliser et de prouver nos capacités à
 nous même mais également aux professionnels et aux patients qui nous 
entourent.
VIETNAM: Ce magnifique pays que nous 
avons choisit pour effectuer ce stage. Son mode de vie, sa culture, ses 
traditions mais également son système de santé qui diffère tellement du 
notre. 
EXPERIENCE: Ce stage nous fera grandir en
 tant que personnes mais également en tant que professionnels de santé. 
Cette expérience restera à jamais un moment clé de notre parcours 
professionnel.
Et enfin...
PASSION: 
Parceque nous aimons notre métier et que ce projet sera pour nous le 
passage du monde des études au monde professionnel. Nous pourrons enfin 
vivre de notre passion: prendre soins d'autrui.
NOTRE STAGE:

Nous partons grâce à l'association Missions Stages. Nous serons hébergés
 à l'orphelinat de Hoa Mai et nous effectuerons notre stage à l'hôtipal 
de Long Thanh (à mi-chemin entre la mer de Chine et la ville 
d'Hochiminh). Grâce à vous nous partirons du 18 avril au 27 mai 2016.
                                                         

Mais tout cela a un coût et c'est pour cela que nous avons besoin de votre générosité..

                     [img src=""https://drfhlmcehrc34.cloudfront.net/cache/c/4/..."">
Merci à vous de nous soutenir !
                    

                    A quoi va servir le financement ?
                Ce financement a pour but de nous aider à financer notre stage.
Détail par personne: 
- 1060€ pour l'association (prise en charge sur le lieu de stage, 
l'hébergement, la nourriture, les transports et l' interprète 
francophone) 
- Billets d'avions : environ 500€
- Frais divers : passeport, Visa, vaccins... : environ 150€
Mais 
vos dons servirons également à financer du matériel médical (gants à 
usage unique, charlottes, surblouses,...), du matériel pour les actions 
de préventions que nous comptons mettre en place au sein de l'orphelinat
 (hygiène bucco-dentaire, hygiène des mains,...). 
Si nous arrivons à récolter plus que ce que nous espérons, les fonds restants seront reversés à l'orphelinat Hoa Mai. 
C'est pour cela que même si notre objectif est atteint, continuez de partager et de parler de notre projet ! 
                                     
                    
                    A propos du porteur de projet
                QUI SOMMES NOUS ?
Nous
 sommes Alexis, Melissa, Grégoire, Chloé, Florent et Emeline, 6 
étudiants infirmiers à l'IFSI (Institut en soins infirmiers) de 
Montereau (77).
Et dans 1 an nous partons pour le Vietnam pour réaliser un de nos rêve: effectuer un stage humanitaire ! 
                                   
NOS MOTIVATIONS:
Ce
 projet serait pour nous l'accomplissement de nos 3 années d'études. 
Nous partageons un rêve commun et celui-ci peut devenir réalité grâce à 
vous, vos dons, votre générosité.
Ce stage serait pour nous un 
moyen d'accroître nos connaissances et de découvrir le Vietnam sous nos 
yeux de soignants. En effet, le système de santé vietnamien diffère 
totalement du système de santé français. Les professionnels fonctionnent
 différemment et travaillent avec les seuls moyens dont ils disposent. 
Nous découvrirons la prise en charge de patients ayant un mode de vie, 
des coutumes et des traditions que nous n'avons jamais pu rencontrer 
dans le cadre de notre formation.
Cette aventure nous sera 
bénéfique, car la barrière de la langue nous amènera à accentuer nos 
efforts sur la construction d'une relation de confiance due à chaque 
patient. Il faudra pour cela faire favoriser la communication non 
verbale et adapter notre attitude afin que le patient soit rassuré quant
 à sa prise en charge.
Nous avons également comme objectif de 
sensibiliser les enfants de l'orphelinat de Hoa Mai à l'hygiène 
bucco-dentaire ainsi qu'à l'hygiène des mains afin qu'ils acquièrent une
 meilleure hygiène de vie.
Grâce à vous nous pourrions atteindre nos objectifs. Nous sortirons enrichit de cette expérience hors du commun !",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2>My story </h2>
<p>Hello, my name is Nastya Parfilo.</p>
<p> I am 22 and I am an artist.</p>
<p>I don’t have higher education but it hasn’t put me off from what I am. You can check</p>
<p>all my works on the website.<br/><a href=""http://www.parfilonastya.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.parfilonastya.com</a><br/><br/>instagram - <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/nastya_parfilo/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.instagram.com/nastya_parfilo/</a></p>
<p>On 1 May 2017 I started a new project called 365 Horse Portraits in 365 Days. This</p>
<p>is a challenge to myself.</p>
<p>I’ve needed to draw a painting every day.</p>
<p>I use canvases (15 x 15 cm) and oil paints.</p>
<p>Horses...</p>
<p> Why horses?</p>
<p>Because I care for these animals.</p>
<p>They are beautiful, graceful, intelligent and incredible.</p>
<p>But they are not always treated well. Some owners are cruel; they exhaust them, beat or train them out of their age group.</p>
<p> I want this to stop.</p>
<p>This project is an attempt to draw people’s attention and teach love to these animals.</p>
<p>I have been drawing horses of real people, bloggers, trainers who take care of them,</p>
<p>love and cherish. Such people sparked this idea in me.</p>
<p>After the project end, 1 May this year, all the small paintings will combine into a large</p>
<p>painting – a mosaic, a horse portrait. And now I need your help to make my</p>
<p>dream come true.</p>
<p>I would like to publish an illustrated book about this project with the pictures of all</p>
<p>365 paintings.</p>

<h3>This campaign is set up to be able to produce a documentary about my father as an artist and to bundle his life's work into a book. </h3>
<p>My whole life i have only known my father with a beard and the fact that he is an artist, primarily a sculptor. With my father already being in his seventies i wanted to start this campaign to honor his oeuvre. Once and for all a spotlight for him and his art. </p>
<p>About a year ago my uncle came up with the idea to have a great exhibition on my father's work here in the Netherlands. A lot of things came to mind like transport costs, promotion costs and if the whole idea would be worth it even if only a handful of people eventually showed up...</p>
<p>I started thinking and instead of focussing all my time and energy into a one-time event i'd make something more durable and a way to give a more in-depth look into the kind of artist my father is. </p>
<p>At first my focus was on the book so i started scanning and editting all the pictures i had of his art. Ranging from the 60's till present day it took me a few weeks to get everything digital. This summer i visited my father in Serbia, where he's currently living again, and found out i still had a long way to go! In his studio i found a lot of paintings and sculptures that i didn't have any pictures of!</p>
<p>So there's a lot of work to be done and it will be only possible with the right fundings. Once i have enough money i can attract a director and a graphic designer, just to name a few. The director will have to give shape how the story about my father is going to be told in a documentary. The graphic designer will tell the story of his oeuvre in pictures. I might even build a website if there are enough resources. </p>
<p>I really hope i can turn this project into a reality!</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>Due to the economies crisis, some year-proved craftsmen also have to close their stores, and their offspring are not interested in their family business due to the financial reasons, the hand-made craftsmanship will be soon disappeared if there is no a marketplace helping the traditional craftsmen.</li>
<li>Fashion means personality. It means you. But more than just being a supplier of Made-in-Italy products, we want to help people to discover their true personalities, their inner selves, and to appreciate the world of beauty surrounding them. </li>

</div></div>","Vicino.co

Vicino is the first community of the craftsmen, designers and the people in Italy. On Vicino,  you can buy unique and handmade items directly from them.

You can now communicate with passionate craftsmen or people in Italy, send them messages and comments, customize your products with them, rate and check their reputations. Shopping on Vicino is a personalized experience for both buyer and seller. Buyers can even access unique and affordable crafted products and services directly from the Italian through Vicino.co on the internet.






Vicino Story 

 Vicino is a group of aficionados of fashion, design and artistry who are passionate about Italy and everything Italian, most importantly, the leather goods for which the country is world famous. 


Excellent Craftsmanship, Story of passion and persistence, unique products and customer service are the spirit of Vicino.
""Before year 2012, I was looking for a pair of unique and crafted shoes that I would like to own in my life, that I can use and love. However, not being able to find anything suitable online, I came to Italy to find excellent shoes makers and created Vicino for some of my friends. 
Now, I'm now making Vicino a better marketplace for the people who live outside Italy. ""   
- Vicino.co, Founder

What We Need & What You Get

We need USD 500 budget to start the marketing expenses and build the relationship with suppliers. We are now focusing on leather goods first. Your supports on social media or the contributions on Indiegogo can help a lot. 


In return for the contributions, we can now mention your name on one of our social media pages, send the testimonials to you from Italy. 
If this campaign is successfully funded, the amount of your contribution will become your credit on Vicino that you can spend. 


How it Works


THE BUYER
1. Sign up  
2. Find the product - It is OK to contact the craftsmen to know more.
3. Purchase and Review

THE SELLER
1. Create profile -  verification needed
2. Post a new listing  - No charge to list an item
3. Get Paid and Fulfill the order
VICINO MARKETPLACE

Listing a post on Vicino is free, we will only charge the seller 3% fee after the sale is made.
We help craftsmen to do Direct Email, SEO, Social Media marketing and provide Photography and Shipping guide, meanwhile the platform comes with English, Italian and support multi-languages. 
Vicino allows people to contact craftsmen freely. Vicino platform is equipped with reputation and review system, secure payment with Paypal. It is an open community built on trust and offering Italian life-style experience.




The Impact

Due to the economies crisis, some year-proved craftsmen also have to close their stores, and their offspring are not interested in their family business due to the financial reasons, the hand-made craftsmanship will be soon disappeared if there is no a marketplace helping the traditional craftsmen.
Fashion means personality. It means you. But more than just being a supplier of Made-in-Italy products, we want to help people to discover their true personalities, their inner selves, and to appreciate the world of beauty surrounding them.

<p>Though few countries have found a way to acknowledge the rights of LGBT+Q community, most of the world's governments and societies perceive non-heterosexual love as a form of crime. The expressions of love, individuality and queer sexuality can lead to persecution, harrassment, death.

It symbolised harmony of values within a person. Not many know that in the Bible, the rainbow is a symbol of divine connection and understanding between people and God. </p><p>For us, the rainbow is a phenomen of the nature. It's a beautiful fleeting moment of awe that belongs to everyone - kids, adults, majorities, minorities. A symbol of future, where the whole span of people will be able to look at each other with love. </p><p><strong><u>WHY IS THIS MONUMENT RELEVANT TO EVERY PLACE IN THE WORLD?</u></strong></p><p>We see the world as a living organism. Every country is like a single organ. Sometimes it takes one failing organ to disrupt health of the whole body. It's enough to see how the anti-minority populism spreads in Europe, how leaders of the big countries learn the worst totalitarian methods from the tyrans. </p><p>From our Polish perspective, we see the Russia's autocratic system infecting Hungary, Poland. We see right-wing populists in Netherland, France, Germany, Austria, Italy influencing each other.  We see how leaders of so called free world watch closely how China and social media are building the system of effective invigilation.</p><p>The countries and societies are one connected vessel. When the storm hits, the ripples are felt everywhere.</p><p><strong><u>DO YOU THINK THAT THE ART CAN CHANGE THE WORLD?</u></strong></p><p>Yes, of course! </p><p><u><strong>ANY PROOF?</strong></u><br/>Well, no one has ever proved something like that, but just see how American pop cultures influence Asia nations. That is also an art, an art of communicating emotions and cultural messages through pictures and dialogues. <br/>Look how religious art have influenced people through the centuries. <br/>Notice how the deconstruction in art foreshadowed deconstruction of the family model. </p><p>The artist sees the world through a very sensitive lens. We need that magnification to see things that need to be changed. </p><p> </p><h3 style=""text-align: center;""><u>HOW DO WE WANT TO SPLIT THE BUDGET?</u></h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1593321780/mdxuvtswrbqynqqbqzcz.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1594405266/t6mbehdqfffqt74ke2sg.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>The amount of money we want to collect will be enough to create two installations.

She survived the Holocaust. Now I notice the same mechanisms still being used to discriminate minorities. Are we unable to learn from ou mistakes? Is egoism the driving force of human nature? Should we be reminded every day of what has happened?The city squares are full of statues of people who served the society well. Most of those people are dead, though. What about heroes that live today? There are fighters who battle with racism, homophobia, xenophobia, poverty. They spend their time making the world more inclusive. It's XXI century, yet we still segregate people and perceive lots of them as ""trash""This ""trash"" is the subject of my installation. It's a monument we would like to erect to appreciate the ones pushed to the margins of society.   ABOUT INSTALLATIONWe want to create the first monument that puts the focus on the people discriminated right now.It will celebrate the life of those who are fighting for their dignity. Of those, who spend their life pursuing idea of freedom and equality. This is a monument that unites us and reminds of how we are forced to feel. Focused on the present time and present actions.   
I'M NOT A GARBAGE
In front of the monument, we want to install six plaques that honor our heroes. Every plaque will contain its own QR code. It opens a dedicated web page with short films and stories concerning the subject.  People with disabilities are too often excluded from full participation in many fields of everyday life. They suffer economically, being unable to find any job despite their qualifications. They ae rarely invited into governing bodies and the society also keeps them at distance. Let's change it!
 

Though few countries have found a way to acknowledge the rights of LGBT+Q community, most of the world's governments and societies perceive non-heterosexual love as a form of crime. The expressions of love, individuality and queer sexuality can lead to persecution, harrassment, death. Things will get better, if we support freedom all the time. 



The last few months have shown that racism is rooted very deeply in our civilisation. All eyes were focused on the USA, but let's be honest - race-based reservations and prejudices run wild all over the world. We need to make a stand, as Martin Luther King once said: “He who passively accepts evil is as much involved in it as he who helps to perpetrate it. He who accepts evil without protesting against it is really cooperating with it.”Sex discrimination is still a major issue around the world. Even in the western countries, 60 years after the sexual revolution, the women still fight for the right to own their body, still have to break through the glass ceiling, keep on struggling with sexual assaults.  




Many people are still persecuted because of their religion. Christians and Muslim, Buddhists and Jews, minor churches and religions are the subject of violent attacks or continuous repression. The victim often becomes a villain. Kindness and understanding are the keys to live together. 




One can be abused for being fat, the other - for having red hair. Whether you are skinny, super tall, smaller than average, when you have skin imprefections and body disabilities - you know that someone will harrass you. Unreal beauty standards made it tough even for those with regular bodies. We all should stop looking so hard at each other. 

 
 

 Questions & Answers WHY DOES THE MONUMENT REMINDS OF THE RANBOW?All over the world, the rainbow have become a symbol of LGBT+Q rights. It symbolised harmony of values within a person. Not many know that in the Bible, the rainbow is a symbol of divine connection and understanding between people and God. For us, the rainbow is a phenomen of the nature. It's a beautiful fleeting moment of awe that belongs to everyone - kids, adults, majorities, minorities. A symbol of future, where the whole span of people will be able to look at each other with love. WHY IS THIS MONUMENT RELEVANT TO EVERY PLACE IN THE WORLD?We see the world as a living organism. Every country is like a single organ. Sometimes it takes one failing organ to disrupt health of the whole body. It's enough to see how the anti-minority populism spreads in Europe, how leaders of the big countries learn the worst totalitarian methods from the tyrans. From our Polish perspective, we see the Russia's autocratic system infecting Hungary, Poland. We see right-wing populists in Netherland, France, Germany, Austria, Italy influencing each other.  We see how leaders of so called free world watch closely how China and social media are building the system of effective invigilation.The countries and societies are one connected vessel. When the storm hits, the ripples are felt everywhere.DO YOU THINK THAT THE ART CAN CHANGE THE WORLD?Yes, of course! ANY PROOF?Well, no one has ever proved something like that, but just see how American pop cultures influence Asia nations. That is also an art, an art of communicating emotions and cultural messages through pictures and dialogues. Look how religious art have influenced people through the centuries. Notice how the deconstruction in art foreshadowed deconstruction of the family model. The artist sees the world through a very sensitive lens. We need that magnification to see things that need to be changed.  HOW DO WE WANT TO SPLIT THE BUDGET?The amount of money we want to collect will be enough to create two installations. The first one we would like to install in Warsaw, as Poland is now struggling to keep the remaining forms of social equality.We also consider Hong Kong as the place where the monument could become a very important symbol of freedom and equal chances for the brave independent society. The second monumet we want to install in New York. USA is still a country were freedom and discrimination are two side of the same coin.If we succeed, we want to reach further. Africa needs a unifying symbol, as a continent that is exploited the most. Berlin, Moscow, Tokyo, San Francisco... the list goes on and on. We need your help to reach our goal! 10%  will allow us to finance small installation within a city landscape. (as pictured below)20%  will be enough to bring small scale installations to number of cities in the world. (Warsaw, Hong Kong, New York, Lagos, Berlin, Tokyo, Moscow, Johannesburg)  30%  will allow to finance a limited version of the monument - without the postument, rainbow trait and six different plates.  50% is enough to build one fully realised, full scale installation.  150% from now on, every 50% more is another installtion - now we can install three monuments, in Warsaw, Hong Kong (if possible), New York.  WHAT DO I GET IN RETURN  The installation will be painted with Vantablack paint - the blackest paint available, that reflects only 1% of light. The donator's name will be etched with and painted with glossy black paint. This wil create a ""deep black hole"" illusion that is very spectacular and instagrammable.POSTCARDSA number of postcards, one of them will contain our ""thank you"" note

<p><b>WHO WE ARE?</b></p>
<p>The Alameda Art Center (CAA) is a multipurpose cultural center, modern and with </p>
<p>various spaces for cultural activities of all kinds.</p>
<p>Despite severe budgetary constraints (The Alameda Art Center receives no state </p>
<p>or private subsidy), the CAA has played a key role in the support, promotion and </p>
<p>development of new cultural projects of quality, uncensored, with an open mind to </p>
<p>the diversity and cultural, ethnic, political, social and spiritual pluralism.</p>
<p>The Art Cinema is the backbone of our proposal, this 70% of the billboard is of </p>
<p>national producers, expressed in nano, short, medium and feature films of various </p>
<p>genres of fiction and nonfiction. At the same time, we encourage the creation of </p>
<p>hearings with the screening of new and classic films of the best international art </p>
<p>cinema. A similar pattern occurs in music, photography, cuisine, literature, visual </p>
<p>arts, circus, theater, performative, among other arts and social activities that take </p>
<p>place in the spaces generated by the CAA.</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>CORNERS INSIDE THE ALAMEDA ARTS CENTER:</b></p>
<p>The CAA as a space that simultaneously integrates various artistic and cultural </p>
<p>divides its spaces in:</p>
<p> - <b>Cine Arte Alameda</b>: Two rooms, one with 300 seats and the other for 27, </p>
<p>aimed at the constant exhibition of the best of national and international </p>
<p>independent cinema. They feature high-tech projection and sound. They </p>
<p>occur throughout the year, exhibitions and film festivals of different styles </p>
<p>and formats, such as Nescafe Edit In the FIDOCS, Mecal, the FIFA or </p>

In 2004, I received a scholarship for my MA in Contemporary Fine Art Practice (MFA) degree course at Leeds Metropolitan University, U.K. After the graduation, I decided to pursue my practice-based research at a PhD level.

In addition, the exhibition promotes contemporary art and informs audience about different ways of practicing art. The set-up of the exhibition is different from a common approach to staging an art exhibition in Mongolia. I worked with my curator and developed the exhibition concept and overall design. This method of organising an art exhibition is rare in Mongolia and it will be a new experience for Mongolian viewers.  <b><br/><br/></b><p>It is vital to show my artworks to Mongolian audience, which I created over the last 10 years. For a very long time, I dreamed of displaying my artworks to the Mongolian public and share my experiences. </p><h3>EXHIBITION SYNOPSIS </h3><p></p><p><strong>Curator: Ester Bozzoni</strong></p>
<p>Tsendpurev Tsegmid inaugurates her first 
solo exhibition in Mongolia, titled “TEN YEARS: RELIGHTING THE 
NARRATIVES” at the Mongolian National Modern Art Gallery in Ulaanbaatar.
 The public gallery displays her exhibition, which condenses the 
creative research of a personal identity, through experiences of 
emotional, cultural and social situations.</p>
<p>The artist draws inspiration from her 
inner world in order to produce photo-based works, and expresses the 
conflicts coming from the contrast between personal and outer realities.
 The selection of large format photographic images combined with 
writings, site-specific installations and video projections of re-edited
 audiovisual materials that Tsendpurev has created instinctively, often 
confiding her feelings to the camera.</p>
<p>­</p>
<p>The crucial moment of Tsendpurev’s life 
was the overseas relocation, which resulted in a long and emotionally 
challenging experience in Leeds – UK, where the artist had to cope with 
her “Being Mongol”, the stereotypes and the resulting redefinition of 
identity, and she fills the images with the dialogues of “Where I come 
from?”, “Who am I?, “Whom I could be?”</p>
<p>In her works, she narrates and analyzes 
the path of an individual, who might be defined as “the erudite 
stranger” through production of series of photographic works. 
Tsendpurev’s massive photographic production tells about the search for a
 balance among different identities, “Stranger”, “Woman”, “Daughter” and
 “Artist”, which are engendered by the comparison with the society and 
the internal conflict the definition of ego. This flow into the research
 that integrates her personal image and her daily surroundings creates a
 space, where the only guests are the artist/model and the camera. The 
resulted artworks come under the term “auto-photo-performance”, coined 
by the artist herself.</p>
<p>The constant presence of Tsendpurev’s art 
practice since 2012 is the gaze on women’s social role, still 
subordinate to men and subjected to social gender pressures. Through the
 external judgment – on art works, as well on the author – the female 
artist experiences a social constriction, which often diverts public 
attention from the conceptual and aesthetic qualities of the works, 
sadly in favor of a voyeurism against the body and the intimacy of the 
individual.</p>
<p>For the last three years, Tsendpurev has 
focused her practice-based research on this theme. The initial 
difficulty of adjusting back to life in Mongolia, gradually gave way to 
the exploration of social boundaries – as she had already addressed in 
the UK – using one’s own body – and no more of her own face – the 
preferred subject for her works. While remaining consistent to the

Short SummaryI am an artist, who was born and grew in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia.I fell in love with art from a very young age, and spent most of my childhood and early adulthood drawing and painting. I studied at the Institute of Fine Arts (est.1945), the most prestigious art school in Mongolia and I learned a lot from my tutors. In 2004, I received a scholarship for my MA in Contemporary Fine Art Practice (MFA) degree course at Leeds Metropolitan University, U.K. After the graduation, I decided to pursue my practice-based research at a PhD level. In October 2012, I returned to Mongolia to start a new chapter in my artistic and creative path. My life started with art, it is continuing through art, and I wish it ends with art.The campaign helps me to showcase selected works from my last ten years of art practice, which encompasses photography, performance, video art, photo essays and public art. The exhibition will be curated by Ester Bozzoni, an Italian artist and a curator, who is based in Ulaanbaatar.  What We Need & What You Get
Our goal is to raise $5000 to stage the exhibition at its best. Since March, we started a local fundraising campaign to raise $1500 of the total amount. The biggest part of the fund will be spent on printing the artworks in large formats on a specialist printer. Artwork printing will cost $2000, framing $700, installation $320, curator’s fee $500, graphic designer $300, catalogue design and printing $900, posters and labels $100, projectors and media players rental $150 and plus a series of small expenses such as papers, tools and inks.In return for your kind support, I will print your names on the exhibition posters and catalogues with my artworks. In addition, we will send you postcards, posters, catalogues and Limited Edition Prints of my artworks. Impact Since 2004, I exhibited in many group exhibitions in the UK, Mongolia, U.S.A, and I was invited to take part in artist residencies at LeedsMet Gallery (2005, UK), The Light Centre (2010, UK), and MONGOL CITIZEN Festival (2014, Germany). TEN YEARS: RELIGHTING THE NARRATIVES is my fifth solo exhibition to date and the first in Mongolia. The exhibition will show artworks, created through performance, photography, video and public art. In addition, the exhibition promotes contemporary art and informs audience about different ways of practicing art. The set-up of the exhibition is different from a common approach to staging an art exhibition in Mongolia. I worked with my curator and developed the exhibition concept and overall design. This method of organising an art exhibition is rare in Mongolia and it will be a new experience for Mongolian viewers.  It is vital to show my artworks to Mongolian audience, which I created over the last 10 years. For a very long time, I dreamed of displaying my artworks to the Mongolian public and share my experiences. EXHIBITION SYNOPSIS Curator: Ester Bozzoni
Tsendpurev Tsegmid inaugurates her first 
solo exhibition in Mongolia, titled “TEN YEARS: RELIGHTING THE 
NARRATIVES” at the Mongolian National Modern Art Gallery in Ulaanbaatar.
 The public gallery displays her exhibition, which condenses the 
creative research of a personal identity, through experiences of 
emotional, cultural and social situations.
The artist draws inspiration from her 
inner world in order to produce photo-based works, and expresses the 
conflicts coming from the contrast between personal and outer realities.
 The selection of large format photographic images combined with 
writings, site-specific installations and video projections of re-edited
 audiovisual materials that Tsendpurev has created instinctively, often 
confiding her feelings to the camera.
­
The crucial moment of Tsendpurev’s life 
was the overseas relocation, which resulted in a long and emotionally 
challenging experience in Leeds – UK, where the artist had to cope with 
her “Being Mongol”, the stereotypes and the resulting redefinition of 
identity, and she fills the images with the dialogues of “Where I come 
from?”, “Who am I?, “Whom I could be?”
In her works, she narrates and analyzes 
the path of an individual, who might be defined as “the erudite 
stranger” through production of series of photographic works. 
Tsendpurev’s massive photographic production tells about the search for a
 balance among different identities, “Stranger”, “Woman”, “Daughter” and
 “Artist”, which are engendered by the comparison with the society and 
the internal conflict the definition of ego. This flow into the research
 that integrates her personal image and her daily surroundings creates a
 space, where the only guests are the artist/model and the camera. The 
resulted artworks come under the term “auto-photo-performance”, coined 
by the artist herself.
The constant presence of Tsendpurev’s art 
practice since 2012 is the gaze on women’s social role, still 
subordinate to men and subjected to social gender pressures. Through the
 external judgment – on art works, as well on the author – the female 
artist experiences a social constriction, which often diverts public 
attention from the conceptual and aesthetic qualities of the works, 
sadly in favor of a voyeurism against the body and the intimacy of the 
individual.
For the last three years, Tsendpurev has 
focused her practice-based research on this theme. The initial 
difficulty of adjusting back to life in Mongolia, gradually gave way to 
the exploration of social boundaries – as she had already addressed in 
the UK – using one’s own body – and no more of her own face – the 
preferred subject for her works. While remaining consistent to the 
previous modus operandi, Tsendpurev approaches a different 
aesthetic which results in a visual experimentation that leaves apart 
the aesthetic and compositional dogmas. Direct and ambiguous images 
point and disappoint the idealization of the female body. The curatorial
 objective is to show the questions addressed by the artist and to 
assemble Tsendpurev’s artistic path, since she left Mongolia in 2004 
until today, under a new perspective and through a thematic grouping of 
art works produced by the artist during this period.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Here we go!</h3><p>As a young Iranian artist, I find myself confronting oppression and censorship when presenting my own art. In Iran, I have never been allowed to freely express myself as a female artist. Art like so many other subjects is controlled by censorship. As long as I was aware of the socio-political condition of my community any form of expression or ideology has been deemed as a threat to the political structure. I believe that art can be a form of growth and advancement for a country. Unfortunately, it isn’t recognized by the ruling parties.</p><p>Currently residing in the United States I have been able to exercise my freedom of expression through my art practice. There have been times when my western audience has viewed my work through a filter of based on generalizations surrounding the current political climate of Iran. The centrifugal force of the region is all consuming and it seems to follow me around the world. Its gravitational pull has affected my individual and social identity, my perception of the world, and my internal being at times.</p><p>We, the young Iranian generation, cannot separate ourselves from our motherland and the oppression that we have endured. We are the children and grandchildren of an oppressed generation whose attempt to obtain freedom has always been ridiculed, punished, and suppressed. Perhaps now is the time that we celebrate (instead of mourn) who we are; a frustrated, and lost generation full of contradictions. Our vision has been systematically calibrated to oppression to the extent that it becomes hard to identify freedom. These conflicts and frictions within us do not make us victims, but a driving force against this singular perspective. It emboldens us to fight and subdue our internal destructive habits and external biased perceptions. This has led us to begin practicing a sense of individual identity far from self-censorship and social boundaries originating from religion and traditions.</p><h3>What is this project about again?!</h3><p>""My Third World"" is a curatorial project by a collective group that celebrates the interwoven oppression as a cultural identity that is a political and environmental consequence by acknowledging it not as a victim but as an exponent. This is a journey for the oppressed to gain control of it in order to purge it from society through time. Maybe by purging this collective suppression, we can find our way towards free individual expression, (expressing it, hearing and respecting another’s).</p><p>Five artists working in different mediums, (such as painting, video, performance, photography, mixed media) are invited to create works within the mentioned context. These five artists are all of a younger generation who are born and raised in Iran.</p><p>This exhibition is an opportunity to showcase the perception and insights of young Iranian artists through their artwork far from cliché propaganda.</p><p>This exhibition includes visual arts, artists talks, and films screenings.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1555627512/pv8oym3dygxib4xqt8mo.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>Acrylic on paper, 2017, Pegah Ahmadi (one of the participant artists)</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1555627553/jkcfxnktrlkspb134dbd.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>Stranger, Acrylic and charcoal on board, Farshad Nasaji (one of the participant artists)</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1555627577/wd1zmw59ejfjj6tb9obm.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>Spark, Brass, Copper and Warm Enamel, Khorshid Joulaee (one of the participant artists)</p><h3>The other important note:</h3><p>This project also aims to provide a larger audience for these emerging artists, so their message can be seen and heard internationally.

Founded in late June 2018 with a non-profit mission of providing exhibition, curatorial, and performance opportunities for local and regional emerging artists, NSE is focused on facilitating direct engagement with the community and increased creative autonomy for artists. This autonomy manifests in shows that are artist-directed, curated, and audience-expanding. We rely on grants and donations to run the space, taking the financial pressure away from the artist and allowing for presentation of artwork without regard to salability. Our 2019 summer season will span six shows and present work by over 17 exceptional emerging artists from Maine, New England, Texas, and Iran.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1555627643/tbxi67ed3sko5dkdhm1y.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>We are so excited for Golaleh Yazdani's exhibition of emerging Iranian artists.

Your funding will help us to ship the artworks from Iran to the United States of America, and it will enable us to compensate our brilliant artists.  Your funding will also help us with the installation of the artwork, marketing, and all the other costs related to the execution and production.</p><h3>Our future hopes for this project:</h3><p>We hope to be able to show this collection in more than one place. This inaugural first exhibition is a step toward opening up a platform for dialog, and exposure to a western audience for these young emerging Iranian artists. We hope that this will be the first of an ongoing collaboration that will expand to more artistic venues, with hopes of developing this into an annual exhibition that would include more Iranian artists as well as artists from other Middle Eastern countries. We believe these conversations need to happen and we are seeing it as our responsibility to be a part of it. This is a long journey, there is still a long road ahead, but we are ready to take on the challenge.

Born and raised in Tehran, Iran, she received her BFA from University of Art in Tehran, and she got her Master of Fine Arts at Maine College of Art in Portland, Maine, U.S.A. She has exhibited in solo and group exhibitions in Tehran, Iran and United States of America.</p><p>Mixed media is Golaleh’s language. She is inspired by the theater and incorporates video, sculpture and performance in her work.</p><p>Growing up in a conservative society with a dictatorial climate was a major influence on Golaleh’s studio practice. In her work; Golaleh talks about the suppression forced upon her family as a consequence of politics and cultural conditions. Her focus is on the emotional effects of suppression and how it is passed down from one generation to the other. She describes how this suppression has became a social identity: “ I believe members of a suppressed society are victims of repressions forced upon them by the community and without noticing it, they become suppressors to the next generations.”</p><p><strong>Joseph Gurka</strong></p><p><a href=""https://www.gurkanomaly.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Joseph Gurka</a> was born in Roselle, NJ.

Here we go!As a young Iranian artist, I find myself confronting oppression and censorship when presenting my own art. In Iran, I have never been allowed to freely express myself as a female artist. Art like so many other subjects is controlled by censorship. As long as I was aware of the socio-political condition of my community any form of expression or ideology has been deemed as a threat to the political structure. I believe that art can be a form of growth and advancement for a country. Unfortunately, it isn’t recognized by the ruling parties.Currently residing in the United States I have been able to exercise my freedom of expression through my art practice. There have been times when my western audience has viewed my work through a filter of based on generalizations surrounding the current political climate of Iran. The centrifugal force of the region is all consuming and it seems to follow me around the world. Its gravitational pull has affected my individual and social identity, my perception of the world, and my internal being at times.We, the young Iranian generation, cannot separate ourselves from our motherland and the oppression that we have endured. We are the children and grandchildren of an oppressed generation whose attempt to obtain freedom has always been ridiculed, punished, and suppressed. Perhaps now is the time that we celebrate (instead of mourn) who we are; a frustrated, and lost generation full of contradictions. Our vision has been systematically calibrated to oppression to the extent that it becomes hard to identify freedom. These conflicts and frictions within us do not make us victims, but a driving force against this singular perspective. It emboldens us to fight and subdue our internal destructive habits and external biased perceptions. This has led us to begin practicing a sense of individual identity far from self-censorship and social boundaries originating from religion and traditions.What is this project about again?!""My Third World"" is a curatorial project by a collective group that celebrates the interwoven oppression as a cultural identity that is a political and environmental consequence by acknowledging it not as a victim but as an exponent. This is a journey for the oppressed to gain control of it in order to purge it from society through time. Maybe by purging this collective suppression, we can find our way towards free individual expression, (expressing it, hearing and respecting another’s).Five artists working in different mediums, (such as painting, video, performance, photography, mixed media) are invited to create works within the mentioned context. These five artists are all of a younger generation who are born and raised in Iran.This exhibition is an opportunity to showcase the perception and insights of young Iranian artists through their artwork far from cliché propaganda.This exhibition includes visual arts, artists talks, and films screenings.Acrylic on paper, 2017, Pegah Ahmadi (one of the participant artists)Stranger, Acrylic and charcoal on board, Farshad Nasaji (one of the participant artists)Spark, Brass, Copper and Warm Enamel, Khorshid Joulaee (one of the participant artists)The other important note:This project also aims to provide a larger audience for these emerging artists, so their message can be seen and heard internationally. It is important for us to bridge the younger generations of both eastern and western communities. Sharing conversations and perceptions one of the most important roles in breaking down the walls between eastern and western communities (a wall that has been made and emphasized through media and political propaganda)This is not a project with mortal life and limited duration, this is a project to create and increase the opportunities for the young emerging Iranian artists and strengthen the direct bridge between western and eastern societies; in the hope that This project is an effective step to achieve this great goal. So where is it going to be?!New System Exhibitions (NSE) is an artist-run exhibition space in the West Bayside neighborhood of Portland, Maine. Founded in late June 2018 with a non-profit mission of providing exhibition, curatorial, and performance opportunities for local and regional emerging artists, NSE is focused on facilitating direct engagement with the community and increased creative autonomy for artists. This autonomy manifests in shows that are artist-directed, curated, and audience-expanding. We rely on grants and donations to run the space, taking the financial pressure away from the artist and allowing for presentation of artwork without regard to salability. Our 2019 summer season will span six shows and present work by over 17 exceptional emerging artists from Maine, New England, Texas, and Iran.We are so excited for Golaleh Yazdani's exhibition of emerging Iranian artists. Golaleh is bringing us a body of work from artists we haven't had the far-seeing ambition to access. Their diverse work will demonstrate the universal artistic themes, but introduce us to a cultural picture that is normally obscured by political and ideological preconceptions. We're lucky to have the opportunity to present this phenomenal show in our space.New System Exhibitions DirectorsWhy do we need financial support:We are an independent group without any financial support from any institutions or organizations. Your funding will help us to ship the artworks from Iran to the United States of America, and it will enable us to compensate our brilliant artists.  Your funding will also help us with the installation of the artwork, marketing, and all the other costs related to the execution and production.Our future hopes for this project:We hope to be able to show this collection in more than one place. This inaugural first exhibition is a step toward opening up a platform for dialog, and exposure to a western audience for these young emerging Iranian artists. We hope that this will be the first of an ongoing collaboration that will expand to more artistic venues, with hopes of developing this into an annual exhibition that would include more Iranian artists as well as artists from other Middle Eastern countries. We believe these conversations need to happen and we are seeing it as our responsibility to be a part of it. This is a long journey, there is still a long road ahead, but we are ready to take on the challenge. We appreciate you helping us take the first step on this journey.Acrylic and colored pencil on paper, 2017, Pegah AhmadiAbout the Curators:Golaleh YazdaniGolaleh Yazdani (b. 1993, Iran), is a mixed media artist using video, sculpture, installation and stop motion animation as part of her studio practice. Born and raised in Tehran, Iran, she received her BFA from University of Art in Tehran, and she got her Master of Fine Arts at Maine College of Art in Portland, Maine, U.S.A. She has exhibited in solo and group exhibitions in Tehran, Iran and United States of America.Mixed media is Golaleh’s language. She is inspired by the theater and incorporates video, sculpture and performance in her work.Growing up in a conservative society with a dictatorial climate was a major influence on Golaleh’s studio practice. In her work; Golaleh talks about the suppression forced upon her family as a consequence of politics and cultural conditions. Her focus is on the emotional effects of suppression and how it is passed down from one generation to the other. She describes how this suppression has became a social identity: “ I believe members of a suppressed society are victims of repressions forced upon them by the community and without noticing it, they become suppressors to the next generations.”Joseph GurkaJoseph Gurka was born in Roselle, NJ.

<h2>RESCUE &amp; CONSERVATION EFFORTS</h2>
<p>The only reason you need to help someone is that you can. With that in mind, I wanted to find a way to help animals as a part of this book. I have partnered with a handful of really fantastic not-for-profits that are doing great work for animals across America.</p>
<p><strong>10% of funds raised by this campaign (after platform fees) will be donated to our Not-For-Profit partners. We are also putting in a custom mural at Indy Humane to help beautify their facility and create wonderful memories for new pet adopters!</strong></p>
<p>It is my hope to use this campaign to share the mission of our Not-For-Profit partners with a wider audience and bolster support through outreach and community awareness. I'll be including illustrations and stories in Clockwork Creatures inspired by the work being done by each of these groups.</p>
<p>To help spread awareness about the incredible work these organizations do, a section at the back of the book will be reserved for stories and images about the real world rescues. Fans will be able to see both the steampunk versions and the real animals that inspired them!</p>

<p>The <strong>Happy Tails</strong> program in Natchitoches Parish, Louisiana, was founded in 2008 with the vision of creating a no-kill shelter that would rehabilitate abused and abandoned animals to ultimately transport them out of the area and into their forever homes. Located on the Parish’s Detention Center grounds, the Happy Tails program works with correctional labor to help care for their many needy charges. By helping to care for and look after the animals, inmates make great strides towards rehabilitation and reintegration. The Happy Tails program has been recognized by the Governor’s Animal Welfare Commission, and recommended as a prototype for other programs within the state.</p>

<p><strong>On Wings Of Care</strong> is a truly incredible organization. A network of pilots, veterinarians, and plenty of folks in between, OWOC provides rescue and relief assistance all across the country. From flying animals from high-kill shelters in the Southern US to forever homes across the country and in Canada, to ecological surveys and even humanitarian missions, the scope of their love is just so impressive. It is hard to know where to start, given just how much incredible work they've done. OWOC also works to prevent illegal poaching of whales, and research assistance with great white sharks and elephant seals in Baja, Mexico. As part of their ocean conservation work, they've documented damage of oil spills and other ecological disasters in the Gulf of Mexico. They've aided veterinarians in Galapagos with rescueing, raising, and releasing small mammals and birds, and transported supplies and doctors to people in need from Alabama to Tibet!</p>

I've also tested out shipping options with the United States Postal Service to ensure that our quoted shipping rates will cover the necessary postage.</p>
<p>The most likely cause of any potential delays are related to my labor as the illustrator, or vendor issues. Vendors have already been selected for all items included as rewards or materials that will be made into rewards, but unexpected supply line issues are always possible. Having worked on numerous books before, I have lots of relevant experience to make sure this project moves along swiftly to completion. The very solid foundation of illustrations is already almost done, and will certainly be complete by the time this campaign's funding period ends. Depending on the popularity of the campaign and the number of additional illustrations required, there may be some delays, but having the body of the book already completed makes this a very minor concern.</p>

The only reason you need to help someone is that you can. With that in mind, I wanted to find a way to help animals as a part of this book. I have partnered with a handful of really fantastic not-for-profits that are doing great work for animals across America.
10% of funds raised by this campaign (after platform fees) will be donated to our Not-For-Profit partners. We are also putting in a custom mural at Indy Humane to help beautify their facility and create wonderful memories for new pet adopters!
It is my hope to use this campaign to share the mission of our Not-For-Profit partners with a wider audience and bolster support through outreach and community awareness. I'll be including illustrations and stories in Clockwork Creatures inspired by the work being done by each of these groups.
To help spread awareness about the incredible work these organizations do, a section at the back of the book will be reserved for stories and images about the real world rescues. Fans will be able to see both the steampunk versions and the real animals that inspired them!
Indy Humane Society

The Humane Society of Indianapolis (casually known as IndyHumane) is a household name for animal lovers in the Circle City. Providing a wide suite of services to the community, HSI is a pillar of the community and a boon to every stray, pet, foster and animal lover in the city. Whether it is their foster program, their adoption center, the low-cost vaccine clinic, or the low-cost spay and neuter program, they’re here to help our furry friends, big and small. My own pup is a “foster failure” from their halls and I cannot sing their praises loudly enough.
IndyHumane Mural Project
As part of the community engagement behind the project, I'll be painting a mural in one of the entry areas at IndyHumane. Organizers are excited to have a place for adopters to take photos with their furry new family members! The project will be completed during the campaign's run time, so be sure to watch the Updates section to see progress on the selection process and mural completion.
 
Natchitoches Humane Society - ""Happy Tails""

The Happy Tails program in Natchitoches Parish, Louisiana, was founded in 2008 with the vision of creating a no-kill shelter that would rehabilitate abused and abandoned animals to ultimately transport them out of the area and into their forever homes. Located on the Parish’s Detention Center grounds, the Happy Tails program works with correctional labor to help care for their many needy charges. By helping to care for and look after the animals, inmates make great strides towards rehabilitation and reintegration. The Happy Tails program has been recognized by the Governor’s Animal Welfare Commission, and recommended as a prototype for other programs within the state.
 
On Wings Of Care

On Wings Of Care is a truly incredible organization. A network of pilots, veterinarians, and plenty of folks in between, OWOC provides rescue and relief assistance all across the country. From flying animals from high-kill shelters in the Southern US to forever homes across the country and in Canada, to ecological surveys and even humanitarian missions, the scope of their love is just so impressive. It is hard to know where to start, given just how much incredible work they've done. OWOC also works to prevent illegal poaching of whales, and research assistance with great white sharks and elephant seals in Baja, Mexico. As part of their ocean conservation work, they've documented damage of oil spills and other ecological disasters in the Gulf of Mexico. They've aided veterinarians in Galapagos with rescueing, raising, and releasing small mammals and birds, and transported supplies and doctors to people in need from Alabama to Tibet!
 

 
Risks and challenges
The risks with a project like this are fairly minimal. I'm working with a factory in China to produce these books, and we've used them for several projects successfully in the past (Young Puffin's Wonderfully Grand Mystery, Ani and The Grumbull). I've run multiple successful Kickstarter campaigns (The Chronicles of Cornelius Cross, Young Puffin's Wonderfully Grand Mystery, CaveGeek's Zodiac Constellation Maps) and have experience with managing fulfillment. I've also tested out shipping options with the United States Postal Service to ensure that our quoted shipping rates will cover the necessary postage.
The most likely cause of any potential delays are related to my labor as the illustrator, or vendor issues. Vendors have already been selected for all items included as rewards or materials that will be made into rewards, but unexpected supply line issues are always possible. Having worked on numerous books before, I have lots of relevant experience to make sure this project moves along swiftly to completion. The very solid foundation of illustrations is already almost done, and will certainly be complete by the time this campaign's funding period ends. Depending on the popularity of the campaign and the number of additional illustrations required, there may be some delays, but having the body of the book already completed makes this a very minor concern.

Que ce soit de la simple déco sur un casque ou une moto à un portait sur un camion ,en passant par les véhicules publicitaires ou les aménagement intérieurs d'établissements comme les restaurants, les boites de nuits, les pubs etc. etc..... </p><p>J'ai tenté l'expérience il y a quelques années en m'installant dans un petit village (loyer plus abordable) et avec mes petits moyens techniques... J'ai vite comprit que si nous ne sommes pas proche de la clientèle et que nous n'avons pas l'équipement adéquat nous ne pouvons tenir la distance . Il faut se donner les moyens d'être VISIBLE et PRODUCTIF . Donc j'ai arrêté ... J'ai peaufiné mon art et étoffé mon carnet d'adresse tout en me faisant un nom et aujourd'hui j'ai un site internet ( <a href=""http://www.sdesignaero.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.sdesignaero.com</a> ) très complet . Et quand je me présente devant un professionnel ou qu'un particulier me contact il me prend au sérieux et peut constater que je connais particulièrement bien mon sujet et qu'il me passionne .</p><p>Donc pour conclure ,si vous décidez de contribuer à la réalisation de mon entreprise , vous me permettrez de vivre de ma passion en concrétisant les rêves de mes clients et en réalisant des oeuvres d'art roulantes (ou pas) qui égaieront les routes que vous empruntez peut-être chaque jour! Quoi de plus sympa quand on roule que de croiser un camion avec une superbe peinture personnalisée pleine de couleurs et de détails !!! Et ce n'est là qu'un exemple bien sûre... </p><p>Voilà ,je crois en mon projet et de nombreux professionnels également et ils me soutiennent en ce sens donc si vous aussi vous y croyez , vous pouvez faire partie de l'aventure ou en parler à vos proches ou à vos collègues, partagez via facebook ou tout autre réseau social!</p><p>Et pensez à ceci : En matière d'impôt ,vous pourrez en déduire une partie, je cite :""Si le don se réalise avec une contrepartie (en nature par exemple), la valeur de cette dernière ne doit pas dépasser un quart (25 %) du montant du don"". <br/><br/></p><p>Merci encore de m'avoir prêté attention et peut être à très bientôt!</p><p>Stéphane.</p><h3><br/></h3></div>","Bonjour à tous!Je me présente , Stéphane ,artiste peintre en aérographie ,alias S'Design Aéro!Je suis ici car après quelques années à me perfectionner dans le domaine de l'aérographie et de la carrosserie moto entre autre ,j'ai décidé de créer une structure plus professionnelle en ouvrant mon atelier pour être en mesure de répondre aux attentes des professionnels qui font appel à moi en plus des particuliers.

Somme nécessaire à l'acquisition du local, l'achat d'une cabine de peinture professionnelle, d'un plus gros compresseur, d'un véhicule utilitaire, de quelques mobiliers, ainsi qu'à une trésorerie pour mon besoin en fond de roulement (BFR).Je vous remercie déjà pour m'avoir lu jusque là car si il est facile de parler de son projet quand il nous passionne il est plus difficile de le poser ici en quelques lignes sans que cela ne soit trop..lourd, et en étant assez explicite. Beaucoup de gens pensent à tort qu'il s'agit d'un hobby quand on leur parle d'aérographie mais il s'agit bel et bien d'un métier avec une réelle clientèle et un nombre de possibilités d'applications très vaste. Que ce soit de la simple déco sur un casque ou une moto à un portait sur un camion ,en passant par les véhicules publicitaires ou les aménagement intérieurs d'établissements comme les restaurants, les boites de nuits, les pubs etc. etc..... J'ai tenté l'expérience il y a quelques années en m'installant dans un petit village (loyer plus abordable) et avec mes petits moyens techniques... J'ai vite comprit que si nous ne sommes pas proche de la clientèle et que nous n'avons pas l'équipement adéquat nous ne pouvons tenir la distance . Il faut se donner les moyens d'être VISIBLE et PRODUCTIF . Donc j'ai arrêté ... J'ai peaufiné mon art et étoffé mon carnet d'adresse tout en me faisant un nom et aujourd'hui j'ai un site internet ( www.sdesignaero.com ) très complet . Et quand je me présente devant un professionnel ou qu'un particulier me contact il me prend au sérieux et peut constater que je connais particulièrement bien mon sujet et qu'il me passionne .Donc pour conclure ,si vous décidez de contribuer à la réalisation de mon entreprise , vous me permettrez de vivre de ma passion en concrétisant les rêves de mes clients et en réalisant des oeuvres d'art roulantes (ou pas) qui égaieront les routes que vous empruntez peut-être chaque jour! Quoi de plus sympa quand on roule que de croiser un camion avec une superbe peinture personnalisée pleine de couleurs et de détails !!! Et ce n'est là qu'un exemple bien sûre... Voilà ,je crois en mon projet et de nombreux professionnels également et ils me soutiennent en ce sens donc si vous aussi vous y croyez , vous pouvez faire partie de l'aventure ou en parler à vos proches ou à vos collègues, partagez via facebook ou tout autre réseau social!Et pensez à ceci : En matière d'impôt ,vous pourrez en déduire une partie, je cite :""Si le don se réalise avec une contrepartie (en nature par exemple), la valeur de cette dernière ne doit pas dépasser un quart (25 %) du montant du don"". Merci encore de m'avoir prêté attention et peut être à très bientôt!Stéphane.",9.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>WHAT IS IT?</h3>
<p>We've designed the How to Draw: FIGURES sketchbook using an easy to follow along ""phase-out"" system that begins with lots of guidelines and as you progress through the sketchbook, the guidelines are simplified, reducing your dependency on those guidelines. We have also included some commonly used industry reference material along with 100+ sketch templates into the most popular and common Moleskine sketchbook form.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1474041671/ptbcdoiwmuf8ng7tdva5.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>DETAILS AND SPECS</h3>
<ul>
<li>Compact and easy to carry with you wherever you go.</li>
<li>Dimensions: 9 x 11 x 0.75 inches</li>
<li>100g white paper</li>
<li>use a pen, pencil, graphite, crayon, marker or whatever. Its a sketchbook!</li>
<li>fits on standard scanner bed so you can scan your sketches.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>ITS WHATS INSIDE THAT MAKES US UNIQUE!</h3>
<p>How to Draw: FIGURES will appeal to a wide range of artists, as the human form is something everyone can relate to.  Although its a complex mechanism, its something that we can easily break down into bite-sized parts.  By doing this, we feel anyone, at any age or any skill level can enjoy this sketchbook. </p>

<h3>THE TEMPLATES</h3>
<p>The intrigue of this Sketchbook is that it gives you the ability to sketch alongside what you are learning. The guidelines help improve your understanding of proportion and perspective, but as the guides phase-out, your mind begins to learn whats missing, so you will eventually be able to draw without the need of any guidelines.  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1474041965/dwigiwhqmhemfwiphahf.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<p><strong>Why are the guidelines Blue?</strong> </p>
<p>By using non-photo blue lines, you can scan your sketch into Adobe Photoshop® and with minimal tweaking, the guidelines disappear leaving only your sketches behind.</p>
<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1474042038/ym141ea0jbrhd2qnq9jp.jpg"" src=""""/></h3>

<p>Manufacturing a product is a monumental feat. Every element is made by a different group of specialists; then we have to arrange for each of these elements to arrive at a manufacturer who then puts all the pieces together. Essentially, it's a task that involves a lot of scheduling, preparation, and care.</p>
<p>Our greatest challenge is to organize these elements for mass production. The different elements include (but are not limited to): artwork, cover material, end papers, quality paper stock, printing on the end papers, printing quality control, packaging, polywrap and shipping packaging.</p>
<p>Once the books are created then we have them delivered to us in Boston, MA where we will ship them to our customers all over the world.</p>
</div></div>","WHAT IS IT?
We've designed the How to Draw: FIGURES sketchbook using an easy to follow along ""phase-out"" system that begins with lots of guidelines and as you progress through the sketchbook, the guidelines are simplified, reducing your dependency on those guidelines. We have also included some commonly used industry reference material along with 100+ sketch templates into the most popular and common Moleskine sketchbook form.


DETAILS AND SPECS

Compact and easy to carry with you wherever you go.
Dimensions: 9 x 11 x 0.75 inches
100g white paper
use a pen, pencil, graphite, crayon, marker or whatever. Its a sketchbook!
fits on standard scanner bed so you can scan your sketches.


ITS WHATS INSIDE THAT MAKES US UNIQUE!
How to Draw: FIGURES will appeal to a wide range of artists, as the human form is something everyone can relate to.  Although its a complex mechanism, its something that we can easily break down into bite-sized parts.  By doing this, we feel anyone, at any age or any skill level can enjoy this sketchbook. 








THE TEMPLATES
The intrigue of this Sketchbook is that it gives you the ability to sketch alongside what you are learning. The guidelines help improve your understanding of proportion and perspective, but as the guides phase-out, your mind begins to learn whats missing, so you will eventually be able to draw without the need of any guidelines.  


Why are the guidelines Blue? 
By using non-photo blue lines, you can scan your sketch into Adobe Photoshop® and with minimal tweaking, the guidelines disappear leaving only your sketches behind.


Use the templates at the back of the book to make as many additional copies for your personal use.  That way, you can keep sketching and drawing till your hearts desire.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><u><strong>OUR COLORFUL IMPACT</strong></u></h3>
<p><strong>Part A </strong>of our two-part exchange was hosted  for a month in <strong>Kenya</strong> this past December (2018). It marked the successful launch of our two-way exchange, when <strong>12 musicians</strong> and <strong>visual artists</strong> from both <strong>France</strong> and <strong>Kenya</strong> came together in ways that undoubtedly gave life to new, meaningful and colorful connections. These 12 artists learned French and Kiswahili (as well as our official Switcharoo language; Frenglish), along with the dynamics and impact of painting forgotten walls in Nairobi, and the art of Kenyan  jamming. Their collective vibration and artistic collaboration quite literally <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Czi7z3---Ls&amp;feature=youtu.be"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">broke the news</a>:</p>

<div style=""text-align: center;""><p style=""text-align: left;"">Together, they’ve witnessed and borrowed inspiration from Kenya’s vast landscapes and built networks that are still impacting their career development. Most of all, they have made a difference.</p></div>

<p> </p>
<p>This being a first-time thing, we had a little; a little time, space, money, equipment, energy and even patience (sometimes). On our own, all this would be impossible in so many ways, but sometimes the big change lies in something as simple as bringing unlikely communities together because by connecting, we have all made Impact through art, that would have been limited if done alone.</p>
<p>But this is just  half of the story. And we need your help to complete the narrative.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><u><strong>The Colorful Mission</strong></u></h3>
<p><strong>Part B</strong> of Switcharoo is set to take place in <strong>France</strong> for the whole month <strong>August</strong> of<strong> 2019</strong>. Our destination is <strong>Nantes/St Nazaire</strong>; a region bursting with international creativity, and tons of green spaces. A region that I personally came to fall in love with as a Kenyan living there, and one that I know for sure will give our Kenyan artists unparalleled exposure to the French cultural waves and artistic vibrations as they reconnect with their new international peers.</p> <p>We are working with various partners to ensure a successful programme, but to complete our colorful narrative, we’re going to need to raise a further<u> <strong>€26,000</strong></u>. And we need YOUR help because everything on this budget is essential; every cent you can gift us counts!</p>
<p>Your gifts will go towards providing a month of shelter, transport, food, art and production supplies for our artists, and facilitation for our hardworking team; some of the basic essentials we need to continue this revolutionary exchange of Franco-Kenya artistic collaboration!</p>
<p><strong>How To Contribute:</strong></p>
<p>We’ve made it easy for you to extend your support; both locally in Kenya (through <a href=""https://secure.changa.co.ke/myweb/share/33290"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Mchanga</strong></a>) and internationally (through <a href=""https://igg.me/at/switcharoo/x/21802197"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Indiegogo</strong></a>), where we’ve got a variety of pledge options for you to choose from.</p>
<p>For every amount donated, you will receive  handmade gifts of gratitude personally designed by our resident artists, such as notepads, t-shirts and tote bags.</p>

</div></div>","The Colorful Idea
Hi, i’m Queen Hephzibah. On most days, I’m a Kenyan Creative Entrepreneur, specializing in Arts and Cultural Management. I believe that we must share in our dreams in order to realize them; and so, I invite you into mine. Her name is Switcharoo, and her aim is to use art as a tool to connect and empower emerging creatives.
Switcharoo is a two-part, Franco-Kenyan, Artist Exchange Program uniquely designed to enable the intercultural and interdisciplinary sharing of skills, experiences, interests and knowledge between young French and Kenyan artists in fun, creatively productive ways, that will expand their capacity for mutual, personal and professional benefits. Our unique two-part model gives all our artists-in-residency the opportunity to share in and consume both the Kenyan and French air, TOGETHER.



OUR COLORFUL IMPACT
Part A of our two-part exchange was hosted  for a month in Kenya this past December (2018). It marked the successful launch of our two-way exchange, when 12 musicians and visual artists from both France and Kenya came together in ways that undoubtedly gave life to new, meaningful and colorful connections. These 12 artists learned French and Kiswahili (as well as our official Switcharoo language; Frenglish), along with the dynamics and impact of painting forgotten walls in Nairobi, and the art of Kenyan  jamming. Their collective vibration and artistic collaboration quite literally broke the news:
 

Together, they’ve witnessed and borrowed inspiration from Kenya’s vast landscapes and built networks that are still impacting their career development. Most of all, they have made a difference.

 
This being a first-time thing, we had a little; a little time, space, money, equipment, energy and even patience (sometimes). On our own, all this would be impossible in so many ways, but sometimes the big change lies in something as simple as bringing unlikely communities together because by connecting, we have all made Impact through art, that would have been limited if done alone.
But this is just  half of the story. And we need your help to complete the narrative.
 

The Colorful Mission
Part B of Switcharoo is set to take place in France for the whole month August of 2019. Our destination is Nantes/St Nazaire; a region bursting with international creativity, and tons of green spaces. A region that I personally came to fall in love with as a Kenyan living there, and one that I know for sure will give our Kenyan artists unparalleled exposure to the French cultural waves and artistic vibrations as they reconnect with their new international peers. We are working with various partners to ensure a successful programme, but to complete our colorful narrative, we’re going to need to raise a further €26,000. And we need YOUR help because everything on this budget is essential; every cent you can gift us counts!
Your gifts will go towards providing a month of shelter, transport, food, art and production supplies for our artists, and facilitation for our hardworking team; some of the basic essentials we need to continue this revolutionary exchange of Franco-Kenya artistic collaboration!
How To Contribute:
We’ve made it easy for you to extend your support; both locally in Kenya (through Mchanga) and internationally (through Indiegogo), where we’ve got a variety of pledge options for you to choose from.
For every amount donated, you will receive  handmade gifts of gratitude personally designed by our resident artists, such as notepads, t-shirts and tote bags.
FAQ's:
'I've got access to stuff on your budget, but not the funds. How can i still help?'
 

 
Funding aside, sharing our campaign within your networks is a way of using your voice to say “Hey world, I believe in our colorful connection”! Your support will not only be making a difference in the lives of our 12 resident artists, but also in all the people that their collaborative creativity, and their passion is meant to reach!! You will be claiming your space in the creation of #AColorfulConnection.
And, If we go over our capaign target, we'll use the overflow to develop our secure online hub for artists in Kenya and France to collaborate digitaly!
As we say here in Switcharoo, Cheers Baba, for claiming your space in the creation of #Acolorfulconnection !!

<h3>The Initiative</h3>
<p>It is perfectly clear that Donald Trump is attacking the postal system as a means to keep people from voting.</p>
<p>Our campaign is simple. We print postcards with George Floyd's image on it and mail them to the White House. Then we mail one to you too, pre-stamped, in a separate envelope.  That's it. 3 stamps total, $1.50 in  postage for the USPS.  If Donald Trump wins this November, he'll get a reminder that we are still here, we're still standing, and history will hold him accountable. If he loses (<strong>OH HAPPY DAY!)</strong> he'll get a glorious reminder that you can't dismantle democracy and disavow an entire group of people in your sad quest for power.  Also,<i>  </i>you've sent him a passive aggressive F*You (hopefully thousands of them) and made a political statement.  Either way, apart from all the divisiveness, a lot of beauty has come from everything that's happened and a lot of that can be seen in the myriad of art pieces that have been created and the warmth and solidarity of all kinds of people coming together. Everyone should see some of the beautiful work that was created, and this is one way to help make that happen.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Frequently-asked questions:</h3>
<p>Won't sending a bunch of postcards right now just add to the burden that the post office has to deal with?</p>
<p><strong>Yes. And for that specific reason we will not be sending ANY postcards out prior to November 3rd because we do not want to interfere with the post office's ability to process ballots. We will most likely wait until at least the 15th of November before we send any postcards out. We will be buying the postage prior to the election however. Most likely as we've passed our funding goal should we get there. Updates will be made as that happens.</strong></p>

<p>Hi!<br/><br/>I have been selected to represent Nepal at Miss Teen Tourism Globe 2019 which is an absolute honour! Sticking to the motto of the pageant ""Yes we can"" and ""Education is the key to success"", as Miss Teen Tourism Nepal 2018, I feel that it is time to give back to the community. The area I have decided to try to bring the change (even if it's the tiniest) is my birthplace: Chitwan.</p>
<p>I believe that if I take few girls who cannot afford going to school by paying their school fees and providing them stationery items and uniforms, I am not just changing their lives and their family's lives, I am changing their communities. Secondly, girls are known to miss many days of school due to their monthly menstruation cycle which has negative impact on their studies. In order to keep their attendance going up, I am planning to distribute good sanitary pads to the girls.</p>
<p>From my research, I have came to a conclusion that parents might have some role in stopping girls for getting higher education. Since, most of the family of Chitwan rely on agriculture, they are sending their girls to the fields instead of sending them to school. In some extreme cases, girls are forced to get married before completing their high school. In order to stop this, I feel there is a need to make parents aware about importance of education and encourage them to send their girls to school.</p>
<p>I believe my purpose on this earth is to live out my identity . I deeply desire to be able to remind girls of their true identity, equip them with the tools they need to be successful, and empower them to live a purpose driven life. I am hoping that this pageant will give me the opportunity to love on, and pour into, my competitors and each and every person that I come in contact with. I am hoping that this competition will also help me as I build a platform to start speaking into the lives of girls around the world.</p>
<p>Despite being rich in natural resources and beauty there is not much tourist flow in Nepal . I will try my best to promote tourism in Nepal.<br/><br/>I would really appreciate if you could help me in this journey because it's not about how much you donate; it's about making a huge difference in someone's life"".</p>

<p> </p>
<p>For the last 10 years I have been creating all types of Fantasy Art. Such as calendars ,art books, print work and clothing, using both models and non models, with many people asking how can I do that, I would love to have artwork like that done?. Well now we have it.</p>
<p>The previous problem being many of the people who have wanted to work with me are several states away or in another country. Normally I shoot my own photos then create the edits. This time you will be able to upload your photos from anywhere to have a piece created as a sponsor.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1539879836/ionfnricmf9ywdkkpk8u.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>In a world that has become unhappy and anti so many things, art helps bring a smile to many people. To watch the transformation from a normal picture into something beautiful. Art is meant as a creation, take a photo , piece of paper or other medium and create something different , appealing and exciting to the eye.</p>
<p>For some it is beauty on land, sea or air, for others it is to become a creature of nightmares. Riding into battle as a warrior or becoming a superhero to allow your imagination to be free, you can be whatever you want in fantasy art.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So for the first time ever, (our most unique perk) I will be doing a 1st edition art book/magazine of everyday people all over the world being turned into fantasy art called Beautiful America. There will be a limited number of pages, if we exceed this a second edition will be added.</p>
<p>So not only will you get a stunning digital art edit creation from your own photo but you will also be in our first Beautiful America Art Book!.</p>

<p>Once you become a sponsor you will be contacted with a email address to send the photos to.</p>

<p>The biggest challenge is to make this a art positive project , without art the world would be just black,white and blah, time to colorize and create. This is a way to give everyone the opportunity to show their true self , done in a very creative form as well as be published in the book.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This project will take about 1-2 months to complete as edits can take anywhere from 2 hours to 12 hours to finish depending on the type chosen and if freehand drawing will be added in after as well.</p>

Totes.   
We have offer a 'Bulk' purchase Perk here and
via our website, for commercial or individual resale.  We
will correspond with you via email and organize shipping costs.  This
perk consists of 25 mixed units (5 of each) at a 40% discount; $2160 for
the Trolley and $900 for the Totes.  The MSRP for the Trolleys is
$144 and $60 for the Totes leaving a gross profit of $1,440 for the Trolleys
and $600 for the Totes.  This does not include shipping and relevant taxes
and duties, if applicable.

Our primary objective is to deliver a product that gives
people joy with its vibrant colors and fun designs as well as being ultra
reliable and practical companion for everyday needs.  We plan to begin
selling Dolly via Indiegogo, our website (www.dianeludwigdesigns.com),
Amazon, Etsy and eventually niche boutiques and selective retail stores
internationally.  Our aim is to add a Social Enterprise element to the
company in due course. 
Dolly
is a brand new start-up.  We have many ideas for the future of Dolly and
its product line that we can incorporate our creative designs.  We aim to
bring fun and artistic motifs to many everyday products and make people happy.                             Kindly share our campaign with friends, family
and colleagues and let us
know if they are interested in finding out more about Dolly and our future
products.  Please view our website and
Facebook page and thank you again for your time.  We
look forward to hearing from you!

<p>My name is Faye Hall, and I am a painter. I started painting as a child, but switched to advertising design in order to make a living and raise my beautiful children. In my later years, I've returned to my original passion of canvas &amp; brush.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b><i>I think that art needs to mean something - to resonate with people's souls and encourage others. How best to do that? Share it! </i></b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>I am painting today because others have encouraged me, inspired me and mentored me throughout the years. I’d like to show you the results with my book.</p>
<p>I am an administrative assistant by day to Canadian singer/songwriter Steve Bell in Winnipeg, Canada. I am painting today, because he took an interest in my art, allowed me to paint his travel photography and even commissioned some personal projects.</p>
<p>
</p>

<p>
</p>
<p><b><i>ART begets ART</i> will explain the sources of my inspiration, which include music, the poetry of Malcolm Guite in the U.K., my faith and life stories of my own and others.

<p>
</p>
<p>Steve Bell shared his stories, music and photography with me. Malcolm Guite shared his poetry and charismatic face for five portraits (so far) and Dr. Charles Mulli has allowed me to share the faces of a few of his 10,000 Kenyan orphans whom he has helped over a period of 25 years.</p>

Komolyabbra fordítva a szót, Bojtor Verabella egy olyan illusztrátor, festő, grafikus, képzőművész, aki egy olvasó-festőember aki nagyon szeretne könyvet illusztrálni, de most először alakult úgy, hogy az ő képei mellé alakulnak a szövegek. Amikor a könyvet elkezdtük tervezgetni, elmesélte, hogy azért szeretné megcsinálni, mert rohadt sok kávét elfogasztott, elfogyaszt és még fog is elfogyasztani. Ha esik, ha fúj, a kávé, az gurul. És természetesen nem titkolt szándéka az is, hogy minél többen ismerjék meg a képein keresztül, hogy mit gondol a világról. Az a koncepciónk, hogy a <strong>Szerelem, élet, halál és egy jó erős fekete</strong> legyen egy felnőtteknek szóló mesekönyv, persze, a képeket a gyerekek is nézegethetik. Legyen ez egy játszós könyv, ami teljesen mentes minden kötöttségtől. Lehet a közepén kezdeni, vagy a legvégén, lehet csak egy oldalt elolvasni, vagy csak egyszerűen elmerülni a képek apró részleteiben. Visszatérve a szabadúszáshoz, mindkettőnk életét, kommunikációját meghatározó és nagyban megkönyítő terep a facebook – egymást is itt ismertük meg.</p>
<p>A <strong>Mokka köz 4-6. </strong>lakóiról szóló könyv megjelentetése érdekében indul ez a kampány a szponzorok felkutatására illetve közösségi finanszírozásra. Ez a könyv könyvesboltokban nem lesz fellelhető, itt lehet rendelni,támogatni a létrejöttét. A nyár elején rendezett kiállítás volt az első lépés afelé, hogy mind szélesebb körben terjedjen a hír a kávéskönyvünkről.</p>
<p>Magamról csak annyira utálok beszélni, amennyire egy átlagos introvertált, röviden azt mondanám el, hogy Budapesten szombathelyi vagyok, Szombathelyen budapesti. Független lény, aki ír, szervez, lát és tanul. Ennek egy része munka, de a másik része a nagyobb munka.</p>

Amikor a könyvet elkezdtük tervezgetni, elmesélte, hogy azért szeretné megcsinálni, mert rohadt sok kávét elfogasztott, elfogyaszt és még fog is elfogyasztani. Ha esik, ha fúj, a kávé, az gurul. És természetesen nem titkolt szándéka az is, hogy minél többen ismerjék meg a képein keresztül, hogy mit gondol a világról. Az a koncepciónk, hogy a Szerelem, élet, halál és egy jó erős fekete legyen egy felnőtteknek szóló mesekönyv, persze, a képeket a gyerekek is nézegethetik. Legyen ez egy játszós könyv, ami teljesen mentes minden kötöttségtől. Lehet a közepén kezdeni, vagy a legvégén, lehet csak egy oldalt elolvasni, vagy csak egyszerűen elmerülni a képek apró részleteiben. Visszatérve a szabadúszáshoz, mindkettőnk életét, kommunikációját meghatározó és nagyban megkönyítő terep a facebook – egymást is itt ismertük meg.
A Mokka köz 4-6. lakóiról szóló könyv megjelentetése érdekében indul ez a kampány a szponzorok felkutatására illetve közösségi finanszírozásra. Ez a könyv könyvesboltokban nem lesz fellelhető, itt lehet rendelni,támogatni a létrejöttét. A nyár elején rendezett kiállítás volt az első lépés afelé, hogy mind szélesebb körben terjedjen a hír a kávéskönyvünkről.
Magamról csak annyira utálok beszélni, amennyire egy átlagos introvertált, röviden azt mondanám el, hogy Budapesten szombathelyi vagyok, Szombathelyen budapesti. Független lény, aki ír, szervez, lát és tanul. Ennek egy része munka, de a másik része a nagyobb munka.
