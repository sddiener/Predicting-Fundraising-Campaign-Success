<p> </p>
<p>Hello, my name is Tanisha Edenfield and I am the owner of Pretty in Pynk, which is a boutique for little girls who love dressing up and wearing chic girly things! My journey to opening this boutique started with my two little nieces whom I love shopping for! Every time I would go out shopping for myself, I would easily find myself in all of the stores for children before I even ventured into the stores I wanted to shop in for myself. I absolutely love tutus on little girls, so that was always the first thing I looked for in any and every store I visited. To my surprise, they became harder and harder to find, and many were not as full as I preferred. Aside from tutus, I was always on the hunt for chic looking blazers and cute trendy cardigans. Every time I shopped for my nieces I had a specific vision of the look I wanted for them, but I had the hardest time finding pieces to complete that look. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>One day I thought to myself, ""<em>I wonder how hard it would be to actually make a tutu on my own</em>""? From there, I went to YouTube and watched several tutorials on different ways to make tutus, and after a couple of months of trial and error, and tweaking a few things here and there, I came up with the perfect technique to achieve the exact look I had in mind. I have always been a creative and entrepreneurial minded person, so naturally after I figured out how to make the perfect tutu, I said to myself,  ""<em>how can I reach people with little girls who are looking for cute clothing for their daughters, nieces, or granddaughters</em>"". I had come up with so many cute and  creative variations of tutus that I was sure there would be a huge demand for them, all I needed to do was find a way to get them to my target market. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I pondered for awhile and thought, ""<em>why not just go for it, create a website, and sell them on there</em>""? That thought was always in the back of my mind, but I still was not content with the idea of <em>only</em> selling tutus, but at the same time, I did not know what else I could or should do.  So I decided to take a step back and ponder things a little while longer. One day I was out shopping in the mall, and I happened to walk past ""Justice"" which is my favorite clothing store for little girls, and all of a sudden it came to me, ""<em>in addition to offering tutus, why not offer trendy little girls clothing</em>""? That day my vision came together full circle, I have always been creative, love styling my little nieces, and have been entrepreneurial minded for as long as I can remember. It made perfect sense to me at that point that instead of just shopping for trendy clothes for my nieces, why not start a boutique where I pick out and sell the type of trendy clothing that I am always searching for and would buy for my nieces! From there I researched different wholesalers and made my first bulk purchase of various trendy items made for little girls in May of 2013. The rest is history! :)</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>What We Need </h2>
<p>Since launching Pretty in Pynk this past spring, it has taken off more then I could have ever imagined! So much so, that I became motivated to create and design my own clothing line for little girls called ""PYNK"".  This clothing line will carry sizes 2t-12(kids) in chic and fashion forward clothing that you would never find in your average children's franchise store or department store. For the past several months, I have worked tirelessly to create the perfect line of clothing! This line will consist of high quality fabrics, with intricate details, and fashion forward designs. It will also be produced by a manufacturer with extensive experience with producing and manufacturing children's clothing. Every last detail of this clothing line is currently in place, and ready to be produced. The only thing left to do is come up with the finances to fund the production of ""PYNK"" so that it can take off and bring children's fashion to another level! I am confident that this line will be a huge success, and have also put forth countless weeks and months of creating and designing every single look that will be produced. I am very proud of the results and ready to introduce ""PYNK"" to the world!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The short term goal is for ""PYNK"" to be offered solely through our online boutique at <a href=""http://www.pretty-in-pynk.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.pretty-in-pynk.com</a>. The long term goal is for Pretty in Pynk to transition from an online boutique, to a national franchise, in which our clothing line ""PYNK"" will be offered throughout various large cities, and will also remain available online so that it will be accessible to both national and international customers. After researching and accessing the cost of fabric, shipping supplies, clothing tags/embellishments, and production, the total amount of money we need to get ""PYNK""  produced is $2,345.</p>

<h2>The Impact</h2>
<p>Pretty in Pynk is very unique in the sense that we encourage and promote individuality and self expression in the form of fashion as a means to help little girls build a positive self image and high self esteem early on in life. In a world where there are so many misconceptions about who and what is beautiful, it is so important to instill a sense of self pride and self confidence in little girls at a young age. At Pretty in Pynk, we are not only committed to helping little girls look their best on the outside, we are just as committed to helping them feel their best on the inside, so that she can stand tall and be her best out in the world! We are currently looking into different community organizations that work with children, with the intent of developing an annual event that reiterates the importance of building positive self image and self esteem in little girls.</p>

<p>In March, we held our only prior campaign on
Kickstarter.com. Within 34 short days, we had received over $580,000 in
pledges, proudly becoming the 58<sup>th</sup> most successful crowdfunded
campaign of all time (as reported by Entrepreneur Magazine). We originally
planned to have all of our apparel out to our Kickstarter backers by July.
There were several kinks in scaling our production an manufacturing, and we are
just now sending out all of our goods to our faithful (and patient) Kickstarter
backers. Now that we have successfully established our manufacturing, and
shirts are reaching our initial backers, the hard part is out of the way—we are
ready for our second bulk order, which will undoubtedly run a whole lot
smoother now that all of our machines, staff, and manufacturing are in place. </p>
<p>Even though we expect to have all of our Indiegogo rewards fulfilled
much sooner, we are promising to have them fulfilled by August, 2014. By
pledging during this campaign, you will receive a 40% discount over our online
pricing, you will be drastically helping charities improve the lives of people
within your community, and you will be among the very few to own our exclusive
colorways before they run out. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/250317/files/20131209023057-Ad_2.jpg?1386585057"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p></div>","Earlier this year, we raised over $580,000 on Kickstarter and completed our first bulk order.

FAQ's, including sizing questions, can be found here- http://www.radiateathletics.com/#!copy-of-faq/cin5

Sizing
These shirts fit like dry fit shirts you may be used to. They are tighter than a regular shirt (so your heat can register on the shirt), but not as tight as compression shirts. This is the best information we can provide regarding sizing. You can also find the sizing chart here - http://www.radiateathletics.com/#!sizing/cjr5

The Impact
In March, we held our only prior campaign on
Kickstarter.com. Within 34 short days, we had received over $580,000 in
pledges, proudly becoming the 58th most successful crowdfunded
campaign of all time (as reported by Entrepreneur Magazine). We originally
planned to have all of our apparel out to our Kickstarter backers by July.
There were several kinks in scaling our production an manufacturing, and we are
just now sending out all of our goods to our faithful (and patient) Kickstarter
backers. Now that we have successfully established our manufacturing, and
shirts are reaching our initial backers, the hard part is out of the way—we are
ready for our second bulk order, which will undoubtedly run a whole lot
smoother now that all of our machines, staff, and manufacturing are in place. 
Even though we expect to have all of our Indiegogo rewards fulfilled
much sooner, we are promising to have them fulfilled by August, 2014. By
pledging during this campaign, you will receive a 40% discount over our online
pricing, you will be drastically helping charities improve the lives of people
within your community, and you will be among the very few to own our exclusive
colorways before they run out.",17.0,1,"1 Campaign

<h2>Background</h2>
In the early days of my<a href=""http://www.facebook.com/pappbrille"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> PAPPBRILLE </a>eye glasses, friends would approach me about creating sun glasses that were stylish, comfortable, offering reliable UV protection and in a low price range. In other words, they wanted me to create a cool pair of glasses that would serve as a steady companion for urban everyday life! For the past year and a half this idea has taken hold of me and led me to develop a diverse array of PAPP UV prototypes, which have been met with great enthusiasm at design fairs and in the personal encounters. I’m now ready to develop a PAPP UV series produced in the same fashion.</div>

<div>PAPP UV are popular not only for their contemporary and minimalist design—they come  in two shapes and two different hues. They also have properties and advantages that ordinary sun glasses do not have. Made from an organic combination of wood and card board, the PAPP UV frame, is created from a single unit of material and is thus lightweight and extremely flexible and resilient. So much so, that they can easily be stored in a book or in a pant pocket without breaking. But there are also other characteristics make PAPP UV a favorite item for our times.</div>

<div> </div>
<div>With regard to sun protection, UV PAPP offers a UV 400 polarization filter, which is guaranteed  by a certified optician.

The eyeglass rims evoke classical cardboard packaging and show that PAPP UV’s conscious attitude toward its primary materials. PAPP UV takes great pride in the fact that it is both hand-crafted in Germany and a sustainable product.</div>
<h1>What the Funds Will Go Toward</h1>
<p>The PAPP UV frames are composed of one unit, and yet there are numerous details and single components that make it a distinctive and original pair of sunglasses. The sun filter, the hinges made of natural rubber, the aluminum temple tips, the shaping molds and the rims are  standard components that must be especially used in order to manufacture PAPP UV. These items make up the basic requirements in order to create a minimal number of the product series. The frames require that a minimal stock of the raw materials must be purchased, and then be custom cut and varnished. The rims which bear the special PAPP UV trademark will be labelled  with the brandname „PAPP UP Berlin.“ Lastly all of the single components must be assembled and the packaging must be developed. In order to be able to make this product available to the public, I need to enlist your help. Thank you very much.</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>I'm a freelance Sound Designer and Composer working within the Music and Audio Post Industries. For the past 15+ years I've been making recordings and creating libraries of sounds. My experience and these recordings start with my my early days recording vintage synthesizers and drum machines at the legendary Audio Playground Synthesizer Museum to teaching Audio Post, Field Recording and Sound Design at Full Sail University to my current award winning work designing sounds for Feature Films and Hardware / Software companies like AudioSpillage's ""DrumSpillage"", Little Endian Ltd's. SpectrumWorx"", The Dave Smith Instruments ""Tempest"" and beyond.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>My goal over the next two months is to recover the other half of my archives from 
storage in Florida, get them here to Colorado and properly edit and archive these recordings 
and sounds to turn them into a creative commons based, royalty free sound library
 for use by others in their own productions. The funding helps cover storage
 costs, shipping, transfers, data backups, studio maintenance and the 
day to day costs of creating, maintaining and preparing a sound library 
for use. The expected release of this library is the end of February 2012.</p>
</div><div>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>You will be contributing to saving a massive wealth of historical recordings of unique and rare music equipment, field recordings and designed sound libraries as well as a large chunk of my cherished memories and experiences. These sounds will then be available for others to use in helping their artistic visions flourish and hopefully make the world a more interesting sounding place. If you are a sound reseller, production company or someone seeking a unique package, there are packages available that are specifically tailored for such uses and needs and may be of interest to you as well.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The uses of a library like this are endless. Since I work as a sound designer I understand what types of sounds could make for interesting source material and what can be done with those types of sounds. Not to mention being able to provide sounds right out of the box that are ready to go. The breadth of this material is extremely broad. From Musical Content to Field Recordings that includes Foley, Ambiences, Props, Rare and Hard to Obtain Recordings, Custom Impulse Responses and loads more. It's great for a novice sound designer all the way to a master. It will also make for amazing musical source content if you're into making any type of music requiring a interesting touch, but especially more esoteric and cutting edge types of music. I'll also be including loads of oops, one shots, and sampler instruments in the packages. I might even include some custom designed hardware and/or software preset collections if all goes well!<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><br/></p>
<p>My funding goal is $1,250.00 USD. A brief explanation of my expenses is already listed above.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>What you get for your contribution will be a free download of a mixed sound collection of various increments based on your contribution amount. I will be sure to mix the content fairly so there's a bit of everything in every level package since I know some of this content could potentially be considered more desirable than other content. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Due to the age imposed technological limitations of a portion of this material, All content will be a MINIMUM of 48kHz/24Bit .wav file format up to 192kHz/24Bit. All files will be organized and meta-tagged using the most popular sound library formats. For example, 60 minutes or stereo audio at 48/24 = 1,012.5mb. 60 minutes of stereo audio at 192/24 = 4050mb. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The contribution reward packages are broken down as such:</p>
<p><br/></p>
<br/>$1 - $4 = My undying gratitude<br/>$5 - $19 = 250mb Download Package - Approximately 15 Minutes of Sounds @ 48/24 stereo wav<br/>$20 - $34 = 500mb Download Package Approximately 30 Minutes of Sounds @ 48/24 stereo wav<br/>$35 - $49 = 750mb Download Package Approximately 45 Minutes of Sounds @ 48/24 stereo wav<br/>$50 - $74 = 1GB Download Package - Approximately 1 Hour of Sounds @ 48/24 stereo wav<br/>$75 - $ 999 = 1.5GB Download Package - Over 1.5 Hours of Sounds @ 48/24 stereo wav<p>$1,000 - $1,999. A 750mb custom one of a kind sound library delivered via insured mail on a USB Drive.</p>
<p>$2,000 - $2,999. A 1.5GB custom one of a kind sound library delivered via insured mail on a USB Drive.<br/></p>
<p>$3,000 or more = A 3GB custom one of a kind sound library delivered via insured mail on a USB drive.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>*The custom sound library packages may take additional time to create/curate and will be delivered no later than October, 31st 2012 unless specified otherwise in an custom agreement. The custom packages will be the only packages that will be legally open for direct resale without significant sonic modification from the original source sound.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>During this process I will possibly be releasing videos of behind the scenes footage of how libraries like this are created and some of my adventures in creating this library, tutorials on how I created some of the sounds and tutorials on potential applications and uses.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I may also hold contests for bonus material, special exclusive content and more. I still need to work out those details though.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Regardless of whether funding is met, the library WILL be completed and delivered. As I
 have more than enough recordings currently accessible to make a 
extensive and unique library. What the library contains or whether some 
of my early recordings and archives are included depends if I can recover them from storage in time. There are other funding sources, beyond my own personal investments. The idea is to hopefully recover the archives that are in storage before they are lost, damaged or technologically irrecoverable and help cover the costs of archiving them for the future.\</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Until I have more specific demo material posted, you can get an idea of what typos of material and sounds I produce via my vimeo and soundcloud pages. <br/></p>

My name is Tom and I'm the Inventor of The Dory Hat.
I know what your thinking. It's just another Hat.
Let me explain...
This hat was designed for people who sail on the water. This Hat has a simple design feature that makes it perfect for boaters. The Dory Hat incorporates a short Visor. When sailing on the water, the sailor is constantly looking up at the sails and wind direction indicators. What happens when its windy on the water and you look up? Your favorite Hat blows off your head and ends up in the water!
Not with The Dory Hat. With its short Visor, The Dory Hat will stay firmly on your head, even in the windiest conditions. In the event The Dory Hat does fall off, no need to worry, The Dory Hat floats! In addition to keeping the sun out of your eyes, because of the short visor, The Dory Hat  increases your peripheral vision and will not obstruct your view. Although The Dory Hat was originally designed for boaters, this hat has many other uses. 
The short visor allows you to work on your favorite toys without interfering with the job at hand. Golfers and tennis players will love the short visor as it won't obstruct your view.
Another important design of The Dory Hat, is the underside of the Visor, features a dark offset color so it cuts down on the suns reflection off the water.
Last but not least, The Dory Hat has an adjustable strap, so one size fits all.
The Dory Hat will be available in Blue, White, Black, Red, Green, Tan, and Yellow.
Please specify in the notes section what color/colors you would like.
All Dory Hats will feature a hip DoryGear logo near the back of the Hat.
Funding will be used for manufacturing, distribution and building a new Website. Dory Hats will retail for $19.95. Watch for our Website in the near future! www.dorygear.com

The “Lume"" is charged by absorbing UV light, not visible light. The difference between sunlight and an LED bulb can be drastic. Sunlight can fully charge the Lume in less that 30 seconds, while LED blubs will not give a complete charge after 10 hours of exposure! The absolute best way to charge up your Lume is direct sunlight. In bright sun, only 30 seconds or less will give a full charge. <br/>There are many different types of light bulbs, so it may help to experiment with various sources to see what works best.

</div></div>","We've been designing and manufacturing watches under our MINUS-8 watch brand as a passion project inside our studio for the past two years. Now, with our newest and most remarkable watch, the MINUS-8 DIVER, we're hoping the pre-sales from our first manufacturing run will give us the capital we need to spin-out and set up the company to rollout even more outstanding products.Please join the MINUS-8 community and pre-order your DIVER today. Thank you for your support!​Drawing from our years of experience designing watches for some of the biggest brands in the world, we refused to compromise on the functional integrity of our DIVER design or on the materials we chose, like ultra-lightweight, corrosion resistant titanium for the case and bracelet.DIVER is a true tool for the deeper places in the world. Our scratch-resistant sapphire crystal lenses are second only to diamonds in terms of hardness for maximum durability. They also feature an anti-reflective coating which transmits over 98% of the available light to the watch face for maximum visibility.  Our team maintained a maniacal attention to detail throughout DIVER's design process. We raised the numbering on the face and machined the numbers on the timing bezel for added contrast and readability. The deeper knurls around the timing ring also provide maximum grip in wet conditions. And for our professional divers out there, the helium release valve maintains the case's integrity and protects the timing mechanism when ascending from the deep.  We use a Seiko NE15 fully automatic movement with 50+ hours of power reserve.  DIVER's luminescent face elements feature Super-LumiNova for maximum brightness. This technology offers up to 10x higher brightness than previous zinc sulfide–based materials and can last for hours in the darkest conditions. TIP: The performance or “glow"" of the Super-LumiNova indices depends on the quality of the light source used to charge. The “Lume"" is charged by absorbing UV light, not visible light. The difference between sunlight and an LED bulb can be drastic. Sunlight can fully charge the Lume in less that 30 seconds, while LED blubs will not give a complete charge after 10 hours of exposure! The absolute best way to charge up your Lume is direct sunlight. In bright sun, only 30 seconds or less will give a full charge. There are many different types of light bulbs, so it may help to experiment with various sources to see what works best. In general, here are the charging sources we’ve discovered, ranked by effectiveness:   #1 Sunlight- Best   #2 Blacklight-Very Good   #3 Florescent bulb or UV LED blubs- OK   #4 White LED’s, Compact Fluorescent-Poor   #5 Incandescent standard bulb-Poor   #6 White or Blue LED- Poor Both DIVER colors feature a matte finish.  READY TO SHIPFor those of you who order a MINUS-8 DIVER from our first production run of 480 units (240 Black and 240 Silver), we begin shipping MID-DECEMBER! FREE SHIPPING IN THE U.S.
11/10 Update! We just received the first 20 watches from our production run and will receive the remainder ahead of schedule! This means we will be shipping all of our early bird orders the first week of December! Special thanks to our friend Jenni Wilson who's been putting our watches to the test!""Tough, reliable, and great looking! The MINUS-8 DIVER is perfect for my work at the aquarium and in the open sea.”  - Jenni Wilson,  Photographer and AAUS Professional Diver @ Long Beach Aquarium  All of our DIVER watches undergo rigorous testing before being released from the factory. Each one is pressure tested by a technician in a Winfred WF-208 water proof testing machine and pressure tested up to 30ATM ( 1016.99 feet) with 3 Bar (43.5 psi) of pressure to verify that the seals are sound and that the helium release valve is working.   The DIVER is an ultra high-performance automatic dive watch that has a unique and versatile look. DIVER looks great with a wetsuit, a sweatsuit or a 3-piece suit. Expert watchmaking, great materials and bold design combine to create a dive watch like nothing you’ve ever seen before.  In response to some feedback we've received, we’ve developed a new line of alternate rubber dive straps in three colors as an add-on product for your MINUS-8 DIVER. These new strap designs are off to the factory for tooling and will be shipped in May of 2017. We think they are a great, wearable alternative to the titanium bracelet that comes standard with each DIVER. We hope you love it!We began designing the DIVER over two years ago. After designing and producing two full lines of watches at MINUS-8, we wanted to make a truly ambitious timepiece. The DIVER is the result of thousands of hours of work, hundreds of sketches and renderings, and countless debates. BRETT LOVELADY / CEO. As the founder of ASTRO Studios, ASTRO Gaming & MINUS-8, Brett and ASTRO have designed hundreds of products, including watches for Nike and other companies. Brett founded MINUS-8 as an original brand inspired by West Coast design culture and the love of machines. KYLE SWEN / VP DESIGN. As an ASTRO partner and design leader at ASTRO Studios and MINUS-8, Kyle has designed and directed the development of many products, wearables & watches including the Nike Fuelband and Nike Triax Watch line. Kyle now directs the team for the whole MINUS-8 collection. DAVID WHETSTONE / DESIGNER. As an ASTRO Design Director and lead designer at ASTRO Studios and MINUS-8, David has developed the modern vision of MINUS-8 and personally designed many of the watches. He also leads the team for the MINUS-8 collection.* SPECIAL RECOGNITION* DANA KRIEGER / EX-ASTRO Creative Director in 2013-14, Dana initiated MINUS-8 as an original ASTRO Program, before moving on to direct design at SONOS. Since launching in 1994, Astro Studios has been designing breakthrough products, brands and experiences at the intersection of technology and lifestyle for many of the best companies in the world. Some of our clients include: FAQsQ: Does MINUS-8 have a Warranty on the DIVER?A: YES! MINUS-8 offers a limited warranty against defects in materials and workmanship for a period of two years following the original purchase date of your MINUS-8 watch from an authorized dealer. This warranty covers defects in materials and workmanship with your MINUS-8 watch. If you encounter either of these issues with your watch we will repair or replace it, subject to our inspection of the watch. The warranty does not cover normal wear and tear, glass, watch case, strap, bracelet, loss or theft. You will void your warranty if you open your caseback, push the buttons underwater, or forget to screw down or push in the crown and expose your watch to moisture. The foregoing does not affect your statutory rights.  Q: What are the risks associated with backing the MINUS-8 DIVER?A: None. Our watches have already gone through design, development and production. We have assembled and are ready to ship 240 Black DIVER watches and 240 Silver Diver watches to our first 480 backers in December of 2016!  Q: How much does shipping cost?A: Shipping is FREE in the US.  Q: Will I receive my MINUS-8 DIVER in time for the holidays?A: Most likely.

He became an inspector in steel projects which added an additional high quality dynamic to his skills.  Personal tragedy in his family with an unsecured gun drove this  passion, skill and welding of steel  to design and develop a system that allows firearms to be properly stored within an artistic and contemporary showcase vault.  This tragedy has culminated in the most beautiful and unique products that VoF brings to the market.     Eric Traboulay's (VP) Background:A graduate of the Univ. of California Riverside in Business and IT systems with graduate degrees in business (MBA) and management (PMP) and he is a lead engineer in a high tech UAV program at Northrop Grumman.

<p>One of the biggest challenges for me, I've already overcome (sort of).

Monroe Threadz is for for stylish, bold women who know themselves and love feeling sexy and independent. The reason I want to tell my story and share my clothes is to motivate young women to start businesses and have a harmonic wealthy life. I want  to support there entrepreneur lifestyle and be able to  provide them with a unique wordrobe to go with there unique life. Road to success:After building Monroe Threadz by creating custom designs , organizing model castings, shoots and different fashion shows. In 2014 I took a huge leap of faith and moved  to LA.  I left with with my sewing machine, Monroe Threadz savings and faith in my dream. I've been living in LA for a little over a year now, its def been challenging but I've slowly  networked and designed outfits that has caught a lot of women's attention. The last two collections I released have gotten a wonderful response and sold more than I projected!!! I was so excited when I got all my orders but quickly became overwhelmed when I had to sit down and sew each design by hand.  Monroe Threadz made a lot of women happy, which gave me the courage to continue implementing designs into the new summer collection, but this time around I WANT TO DO IT RIGHT and get my 12 Monroe Threadz pieces reproduced in small, medium and large!  It would be an amazing feeling to release this Summer collection professionally to a larger crowd of women.What needs to be done to make this dream turn reality:I working to get each popular design re-manufactured in addition to some new summer designs, to make this happen I need $10,000 and happen to be $7000 short. Funds will go directly into manufacturing, organizing a professional lookbook shoot, recreating a fabulous website where women can also order custom designs and assembling a new Monroe Team (Monroe modelz, make up artist, photographers, stylist, hair stylist and many more. With the capital that I have already contributed and the money I will raise with your help, I will be able to complete this collection and give my Monroe boss women exactly what they need and also have the product to showcase my designs in two interested LA boutiques!
I believe YOU GET WHAT YOU GIVE so I created some lovely perks to show my appreciation!

<p>My name is Ian, and I set out on a personal and professional journey many months ago to create one of the first and most unique clothing brands in aviation. Many may not realize it, but aviation is a beautiful and adventurous sport, hobby, industry, but most importantly it is an art form. I was very surprised to find that there is no clothing brand that tries to express the love for aviation in the way we all see it. This is when I came up with the idea to put my love for fashion and t-shirts and mix with my huge passion for aviation (I am a pilot).<br/><br/> I am asking for you fellow lovers of aviation and design, to help contribute to this idea in a huge way. I am seeking anyone that loves fresh and unique designs to help me in furthering my first t-shirt line for Heading 370. With one design already production, we know that we need more designs out there for the world to see. This is where you all come in. By contributing to our campaign, you are helping the world see the impact that aviation has on its users. <br/><br/> The beauty of this clothing brand is that we aren't just attracting the pilot and aviation community, our designs will attract anyone! By providing inspirational messages and unique designs on our clothing, we are positive anyone can see the value in our brand.</p>
<p><strong>Why do we need the money?</strong></p>
<p>We are trying to raise $6,000 to help fund directly the design and production of four to five more tee designs. With a large portfolio of designs ready to be implemented, we are ready to get the ball rolling once the funds are there.</p>
<p>We are very excited about the perks we are offering anyone who contributes. Please check them out!</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>Your contribution, however big or small is HUGE to us! All the funds will help aid in a new revolution of clothing for the aviation sector. We want so badly to bring a reputable clothing brand to aviation, and without your help we don't know if we could. We are all about our following and appreciate anything you bring to the table.</p>
<p>We understand if you are unable to contribute monetarily, but we would love for you to share this new company with your friends and family on Twitter, Facebook, and any other social media platform if possible.</p>
<p>Thank you so much!</p>

<h3><strong>Why Indiegogo?</strong></h3>
<h3>
<br/><em>PLASTIC SUCKS! And we are the alternative!</em>
</h3>
<p><br/>We are fed up to the back teeth and don’t want to see anymore plastic totes. So here is the ecologic, ergonomic and reasonably priced alternative:</p>
<p><br/>Our team of scientists, living in underground labs, fulfilled the impossible after uncountable tries. They managed to cross-breed a standard cotton pouch with an ordinary bag. The result is the best of two worlds, the B.E.U.T.E.L. (short for bearable, ergonomic, unisex, turbulent, extraordinary, lifestyle)</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.ph-werk.de/images/product_images/original_images/phwerk-beutel-plastic-sucks-front.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left;""/><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.ph-werk.de/images/product_images/original_images/phwerk-beutel-dont-shoot-the-chickens-front.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.ph-werk.de/images/product_images/original_images/phwerk-beutel-just-fucking-buy-it-front.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.ph-werk.de/images/product_images/original_images/phwerk-beutel-me-front.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.ph-werk.de/images/product_images/original_images/phwerk-beutel-world-front.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>This hybrid (made of 100% cotton) is winning anyone over by its innovative form and the B.E.U.T.E.L. lace makes it possible to bear heavy loads in an easy manner, without any constrictions.<br/>Another feature of quality is the enormous fabric-thickness. It guarantees a long lasting durability.<br/>But it’s the printing which makes this formidable transportation device to an object of the pride of human handcrafting creation.<br/>On this account we gave our visions to the talented hands of our young and aspiring designer Lisa Pham. Her skills and her appreciation of art, transformed our ideas into pieces of art.</p>
<h3><strong> </strong></h3>
<h3>Why do we need your help?</h3>
<p>To see if our ideas work, we’ve produced a small amount of B.E.U.T.E.L. This gave us the possibility to check the quality, test its features and gave Fashion Experts the opportunity to validate our product. <a href=""http://www.ph-werk.de/info/In-den-Medien.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">(Link just in german)</a></p>
<p>We and everyone else we’ve presented the B.E.U.T.E.L. were excited and convinced of our idea and the final result. So we decided to produce a larger amount to give everyone the chance to get a high quality B.E.U.T.E.L. for little money.</p>
<h3><strong> </strong></h3>
<h3>How do the contributors help?</h3>
<p>You are helping to:<br/>- Prevent the increasing plastic trash<br/>- Make the world a better place<br/>- Let you look as best as possible ;-)</p>
<p>These goals can only be achieved by financial help to produce a larger amount of our eco-friendly cotton bags. So they can be selled to a larger audience to a lower price.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What happens, if we don’t get the money we need?</h3>
<p>If we don’t reach our aimed goal, Flip and Phil will live of water and bread in the future, but you will nevertheless send you your promised Perks.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Is it possible to help you without money?</h3>
<p>Of course, you can help us by promoting our campaign. Tell your friends and family. Because only together we can change something!</p>

<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Warum brauchen wir Hilfe?</strong></h3>
<p>Um die Idee in die Tat umzusetzen, haben wir bereits eine Mini-Auflage hergestellt um die Qualität zu bewerten, die Eigenschaften zu testen und sie Mode Experten bewerten zu lassen. <a href=""http://www.ph-werk.de/info/In-den-Medien.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">(Link)</a><br/>Wir und allen denen wir unseren BEUTEL vorgestellt haben, waren begeistert und überzeugt. Deshalb möchten wir ihn in größeren Mengen herstellen um allen die Chance zu bieten, ebenfalls einen B.E.U.T.E.L. für weniger Geld erwerben zu können.</p>
<h3><strong> </strong></h3>
<h3><strong>Wobei helfen die Spender?</strong></h3>
<p>Du hilfst dabei:<br/>- Das Plastemüll sich nicht weiter vermehrt<br/>- Die Welt ein bisschen schöner zu machen<br/>- Euch unheimlich gut aussehen zu lassen ;-)</p>
<p>Diese Ziele können wir nur durch finanzielle Mittel erreichen, mit denen wir eine größere Menge B.E.U.T.E.L. herstellen und sie einem größeren Publikum für einen geringeren Preis anbieten können.</p>
<h3>
<br/><strong>Was passiert, wenn weniger Geld zusammenkommt?</strong>
</h3>
<p>Falls wir unseren Zielbetrag nicht erreichen, werden sich Flip und Phil in Zukunft nur noch von Wasser und Brot ernähren und ihr erhaltet eure versprochenen Perks trotzdem.</p>
<h3>
<br/><strong>Kann ich auch ohne Geld helfen?</strong>
</h3>
<p>Natürlich kannst du uns auch behilflich sein, indem du dabei hilfst, unsere Kampagne bekannter zu machen. Erzähle deinen Freunden und Bekannten von der Kampagne und unserer Idee. Denn nur zusammen können wir etwas ändern.</p>

PLASTIC SUCKS! And we are the alternative!

This hybrid (made of 100% cotton) is winning anyone over by its innovative form and the B.E.U.T.E.L. lace makes it possible to bear heavy loads in an easy manner, without any constrictions.Another feature of quality is the enormous fabric-thickness.

Zu diesem Zweck, ließen wir unsere Visionen von der talentierten und aufstrebenden jungen Designerin Lisa Pham umsetzen. Durch ihre Fertigkeiten und ihr Kunstverständnis wurden aus Ideen - Kunstwerke.
 
Warum brauchen wir Hilfe?
Um die Idee in die Tat umzusetzen, haben wir bereits eine Mini-Auflage hergestellt um die Qualität zu bewerten, die Eigenschaften zu testen und sie Mode Experten bewerten zu lassen. (Link)Wir und allen denen wir unseren BEUTEL vorgestellt haben, waren begeistert und überzeugt. Deshalb möchten wir ihn in größeren Mengen herstellen um allen die Chance zu bieten, ebenfalls einen B.E.U.T.E.L. für weniger Geld erwerben zu können.
 
Wobei helfen die Spender?
Du hilfst dabei:- Das Plastemüll sich nicht weiter vermehrt- Die Welt ein bisschen schöner zu machen- Euch unheimlich gut aussehen zu lassen ;-)
Diese Ziele können wir nur durch finanzielle Mittel erreichen, mit denen wir eine größere Menge B.E.U.T.E.L. herstellen und sie einem größeren Publikum für einen geringeren Preis anbieten können.

Was passiert, wenn weniger Geld zusammenkommt?

Falls wir unseren Zielbetrag nicht erreichen, werden sich Flip und Phil in Zukunft nur noch von Wasser und Brot ernähren und ihr erhaltet eure versprochenen Perks trotzdem.

Kann ich auch ohne Geld helfen?

Natürlich kannst du uns auch behilflich sein, indem du dabei hilfst, unsere Kampagne bekannter zu machen. Erzähle deinen Freunden und Bekannten von der Kampagne und unserer Idee. Denn nur zusammen können wir etwas ändern.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi, my name is Suzanne McAllister and I have been growing as a small independent label since 2011. I have been building up my business while studying my second fashion degree as a mature student. I am completely committed to running a more ethical label and I try to minimize any negative effects I might have on the environment while at the same time, supporting other local businesses and suppliers. </p>
<p>I started this label from nothing, I sold anything and everything I could on eBay to raise enough money to upgrade my old sewing machines to industrial versions and have re invested every penny I have made so far back into buying supplies.</p>
<p>I'm at a point now where I want to do more. I want to print on to my own fabrics, launch a range of menswear and bespoke suits and finish off all my stretch fabrics more professionally. For this to happen I need to invest in a cover stitch machine, upgrade my pattern cutting table to a larger, more workable space and buy the tools I need to print onto fabrics and for this, I could do with some help. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>To begin to acquire the things above I need a minimum of £1000. It doesn't sound like a lot but for a small business it can be. </p>
<p>To break it down of that £1000, £400 would go towards a cover stitch machine, £100 to custom build myself a larger cutting table and £500 to invest in printing materials and fabrics which are environmentally sound and organic if possible. If I raise more then I can buy better equipment and may even be able to look at buying more organic and recycled fabrics in bulk as at the moment I don't have the buying power for that and can only buy small amounts. This has the advantage that I can do small, more unique runs of designs, but the down side that if I do find some awesome fabric, I can't buy more then a few metres and then that design is gone forever. </p>
<p>If I don't reach my entire goal I will put what I can towards printing materials firstly as I really want to show you some of my new ideas for prints which will work into new designs, and maybe then look at a new cutting table and lastly a cover stitch machine.</p>
<p>In return I hope you will find a diverse range of perks. If there is something you would like but isn't listed, just contact me and I will see if I can add it to the list. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I have been doing so well, with great feedback and support from wonderful customers but I need to take a further step towards building this label. I would like to expand one day so I can employ people like myself, with a passion for fashion and protecting the planet. I never have and never will use sweatshop labour and I support locally as much as I can. If you help me to grow, that has a knock on effect meaning more money goes into locally sourcing labour and supplies.</p>
<p>I want people to realise that more sustainable and eco friendly fashion is out there and can be seriously stylish and better made then fast fashion, meaning you don't have to waste money buying cheap, expolitation rife clothing from bargain stores only to throw it away later. Instead you could buy an amazing piece from an independent designer and have it last you forever.</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>If you can't afford to contribute don't worry! Thank you so much for taking the time to read all of this. If you get a chance, just share this on your facebook or blog. Spreading the word is just as valuable as a contribution and is very much appreciated. If you can spare a few quid to help a label like mine grow then great, and I hope you won't be disappointed with the results.</p>

It is called the Avantgarde R7 and we are excited to bring you along on the journey of making it a reality. It was late 2017 when we stumbled upon an abandoned aircraft hangar in Japan during our business visit to a watch making factory.  The combination of elements of the dystopian aircraft hangar and the fine craftmanship of Japanese watchmaking led us to design the R7 Avantgarde. We work tirelessly for the past 6 months to design and build the prototype.

<p>My name is Ryan Hyde.  As an inventor and product creator,
I love cool products that make a difference in the world.  Two years ago I
launched The Gun Box on Indiegogo.  The Gun Box solved a problem gun
owners, like myself, face each day. “Where can I safely keep my gun so I have
access when I need it?”  Because I may choose to keep a gun anywhere, and
because traditional gun storage solutions were never intended to be part of
home décor, no solution existed that worked for me. The Gun Box 1.0 began the
evolution of gun storage and was designed to be left out in plain sight.
 It has the tech to open quickly while keeping your family safe.  Our
solution made a gun-owners responsibility to “protect and defend anytime,
anywhere” a reality.</p>
<p>Since the launch of 1.0 we have had
hundreds of customers ask for a more streamlined portable version. I am very
proud to launch The Gun Box Echo! Echo means a close parallel, or repetition of
an idea, feeling, style, or event.  If you love the original Gun box you
will love this product.  Lots of new tech has been added to push the
evolution of gun storage even further!</p>
<p>The Gun Box Echo is uniquely designed to be part of your home décor.
Using the latest in technology including Bluetooth, Biometric, &amp; RFid you
have multiple ways to access the box quickly. Echo can be mounted in any orientation,
secured with the tether cable and has an audible alarm attached to a accelerometer
that will sound if the box starts moving. The free smart app allows you to
adjust the settings on the box and give access to the box if you’re not there.
With interior measurements of 7.25 x 8.5 the Gun Box Echo is big enough to
store most duty sized firearms. This is a smart gun storage solution. </p>
<p>We need your help to get this product off the ground, we need
your feedback,  and get the word out.
Please share this campaign with anyone.  </p>

</div></div>","At some point, you have probably owned a smart wristband to track activity and exercise. But there is something special about owning a watch, not just to tell the time, but as an expression of style too. That’s why we made BozGo. It’s more than just a watch with sports tracking functions, BozGo has other important features like 24-hour seamless heart-rate tracking and sleep monitoring. It helps you keep track of your active and healthy life. It’s incredibly useful but stylish too. And best of all, we managed to include all the best qualities of an activity tracker and a fashion watch while keeping the price affordable for anyone.   

 

 
Heart Rate Monitor and Activity Tracker 
To make exercise tracking easy, it shouldn’t be a hassle. BozGo keeps track of heart rate, calories burned, and distance traveled via it’s photoelectric and the acceleration sensor. Walking and running activities are automatically recognized.
24/7 heart ratio monitoring
Sleep monitoring
The latest scientific studies show that proper rest is essential for good health. BozGo can help! It features automatic Sleep Cycle analysis to help you better understand your sleep patterns and get a good night’s rest. BozGo can tell by your activity that you have gone to bed and monitors your pulse rate, measures your sleep quality and determines periods of light sleep and deep sleep. When it’s time to wake up, a gentle, silent, vibrating alarm wakes you at the optimal time.
 
Sleep better
Monitor sleep quality
 
Ultimate coach
But fitness tracking isn’t just boring data. Using the free APP Racefit Pro, you can set fitness targets with Bozgo, monitor your progress and mark your completions. It’s a fun way to get serious about health while setting and achieving your activity goals. The highly-rated app also rewards achievements, offers advice and lets you challenge friends to help keep you motivated and push you further.

 

 
Unlike typical sports watches, BozGo has a totally unique 3D interface. It is not necessary to study complicated graphs or reports to understand activity performance, the watch face uses 3D animations to easily see at a glance one’s daily activities, sleep information, and more. It even has friendly inactivity reminders to help users be fitness-minded.
 

 
Premium Materials
Any watch built for serious activity requires quality components. BozGo uses the best. It’s constructed with durability in mind using a stainless steel body, silicone sports strap, & a variety of stylish color options. The strap is easy to change and is available in cool, modern color choices so that you can coordinate BozGo with your outfits and other accessories to perfectly complement your own personal style. Wear it loud, wear it proud, with Bozgo.
BozGo Premium & BozGo


 
Less Charging 
Daily charging is inconvenient and easy to forget. BozGo’s onboard battery can provide up to a 5-day battery life on a single charge so you can spend more time on the go and less time connected to the charger.

 

 
BozGo does more than other sports trackers too. It has a suite of new smart functions that set it apart from competitors, including phone notifications and motion controls that can turn on the smartwatch or control a phone camera remotely with just a flip of the wrist.

Big brands have been churning out the same underwear, made from the same fabric, in the same shape for as long as we can remember. We at ZLDN Underwear believe it's time men had more of a choice. Through our innovative fit, premium fabric and original prints we're excited to bring you an entirely new range of ultra-comfortable underwear. We believe in fair pricing so you can own your very own pair without being ripped off by so-called 'luxury brands'.NB: We will contact you for your print and size choice after you make your pre-order. This standard practice for Indigogo.We travelled the world to source a better fabric and found an Austrian technology fabric called Lenzing MicroModal®, made from sustainably sourced Beech trees. It is three-times softer than cotton and comfortable beyond belief. It's also moisture wicking and breathable. We know pants. We've spent more than two years tweaking the cut and fit and have been led by the views of our customers. They spoke and we listened - taking into account more than 300 guys' opinions views on what makes the perfect pair of boxers. We took apart the boxer brief and re-designed the cut, adding in 3 more panels than the average pair to put an end to riding up! After slipping these bad boys on you'll never look back.For this collection, we remained true to our passion for creating ""trademark bold prints"" - (GQ.com). Working with London-based artist Ross Aitken using inspiration from dutch-wax textiles and 90s pop culture, we spent months creating these four original and distinctive patterns; Rewind, Radio Wave, Bird and Outbound.We also created an option in white and black.NB: We will contact you for your print and size choice after you make your pre-order. This standard practice for Indigogo.We couldn't just stop with mens' boxers so have also created a ultra-comfy womens' version. Also made from MicroModal®, featuring our brushed elastic and elastic piping to stop the slip, these are the only womens' briefs you'll ever want to wear.As an Indiegogo special, we have created a fitted t-shirt made from our MicroModal® fabric.

<p></p>
<ul>
<li>We have found a way to make changing your baby in public a safe and sanitary process. We have accomplished this by implementing a very special material that we will be using for the bed surface of The Baby Changer, our germ/bacteria efficiency rate will be 99.9% effective. This is superseding the 30%-65% rate that you are getting with the current public changers. </li>
<li>Current public changing stations use Microban technology, the current leader in fighting off ""odor causing bacterias"" - ODOR! We believe that other bacteria are just as harmful, or worse, and the evidence supports the fact that touch surface bacterias are way worse! The Baby Changer product has a way to stave off ALL bacterias. </li>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The bacterias </span>found<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> on current baby changing stations include but are not limited to</span>: <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Salmonella, Shigella, E. coli, the MRSA virus, Staphylococcus (staff infection), and Enterobacter (a fecal virus that causes a nasty stomach bug like the noral virus). With these bacterias showing up at a rate of 80% in the current units and </span>other<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> alarming statistics like 9 out of 10 current tables will test positive for crack/cocaine residue. This made us realize we need to act quickly, and provide something safe. </span><br/>
</li>
<li>With 6 different kinds of bacterias prevalent on these current baby changers we plan to kill them all by using our 99.9% effective germ killing material. Our special material kills the following bacterias: Escherichia coli (E. coli), Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus aureus (staff infection), Enterobacter aerogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus. All of which would prevent any bacterias to survive on our surface eliminating the chance of disease spreading.</li>
<li>How are we creating a surface that is 99.9% germ efficient? We are using an EPA regulated, clinically tested and proven safe material which is called Antimicrobial Copper Alloys. This material is tested regularly to provide safety in many different facets of its use. But for our use, there is nothing better! Without any other form of sanitation we can create this are environment for all to use! This is our secret weapon and we hope to expose it for the safe and sustainable material it is. <div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""272"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fplayer.vimeo.com%2Fvideo%2F110428917&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F110428917&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fb.vimeocdn.com%2Fthumbnails%2Fdefaults%2Fdefault.480x640.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=vimeo"" width=""580""></iframe></div>

Antimicrobial Copper Alloys surfaces kill greater than 99.9% of bacteria within two hours, and continue to kill 99% of bacteria even after repeated contamination.

<li>Funding is going to help us create this product to our fullest extent, we have many things to do to make The Baby Changer something you see in every public restroom and saving children from every public bacteria/germ possible. The initial funding will go towards legal necessities that will include patent/trademark/copyright filings costs and lawyer fees. We are going to need a few utility and design patents, which are not cheap, but we want to make sure that only product insuring child's safety is The Baby Changer and not one of the current companies claiming to. Also a working prototype of the product, a prototype that will feature all of the necessary and unique components to our changing table.  This will be a huge step for The Baby Changer because after working out any kinks that may come with prototyping, we can work towards manufacturing full scale units.

We are a team of three creative people from different backgrounds who came together for one project. After meeting each other in our Los Angeles apartment complex, we decided that our creative brains and individual skill sets needed to be combined to get behind one very large project - one hopefully large enough to change the world.
 The Baby Changer is a revolutionary way to change your baby. Our vision is to change public health standards to provide cleanliness and safety for every child being changed on public tables. The current health standards for public changing stations and the majority of the changing tables being used bothered us so deeply that we ventured out to create the a new and progressively protective way to safely change your child in public.  This idea that we could have a substantial impact on future generations and provide a safe and sanitary way to have parents change their children, fueled us to create The Baby Changer.  

In our road to creating this, we are going to need the support of Mothers, Fathers, Grandmothers, Grandfathers, and other concerned citizens of the world to help us obtain funding necessarily to build this product out and make it available to public bathroom facilities. This is a huge undertaking, instating a new health standard for bathrooms and a safe and sanitary way to change children in public. And that's why we need you! 
What Makes US Different

With these bacterias showing up at a rate of 80% in the current units and other alarming statistics like 9 out of 10 current tables will test positive for crack/cocaine residue. This made us realize we need to act quickly, and provide something safe.

Risks & Challenges








We have some major challenges to tackle but all the challenges that we hope to tackle are with your help! The biggest ones are surrounding public perception of the current baby changing stations. There is a lot to know about the current system and so many flaws that haven't been changed for almost 30 years! This really is hard to believe and really hard to bare for parents, grandparents and concerned citizens alike. The biggest challenge through all this is to shed enough light on the current problem: which is dangerous touch surfaces for children, diseases that can be contracted and very serious sicknesses that could leave children in the hospital or worse.

Another challenge is the cost for our new product,  this is something that concerned us greatly originally. However we have found that even with all the features we are going to include with The Baby Changer, it will still come in below all of the current units that are being sold today. The cost for the current units is outrageous considering the lowest model costs around $185 USD and the best models costing almost $1300 USD. These prices are hard to believe when all you are getting is some scrap plastic and mane possible injury points for the children laying on them.  
Help us tackle these challenges head on by spreading awareness to family, friends, relatives and co-workers. Bring this epidemic to light and help us provide a drastic change to end it!

I (officially) started this company back in February 2014. Then called Harvey Harper, this started as a concept to create socks that expressed my personality while at work. While on the search for socks that were both fun yet professional, all I could find were boring dark dress socks or the one's with the bright colors and patterns. So I set to work creating a sock that would turn heads, just not my bosses. </p><p id=""yui_3_10_1_1_1398736029597_112537"">As I researched other designs and companies, I noticed a theme with how clothing businesses operated. One, they mass producing products into 'small batches' at large profit margins. Secondly, they follow the buy one give one 'marketing' approach. </p><p id=""yui_3_10_1_1_1398736029597_112537"">Being a conscious consumer, I am constantly looking for ways to value my purchasing power, and try to mainly buy from companies that are local, follow fair trade practices and give back. While I appreciate the steps these social companies have taken so far, a majority of these buy one give one companies fall short with their donation side when making a lasting impact in my community. The item they donate goes to third world countries, which is a step in some direction, however, mostly these types of donations are a handout only program without actually impacting the system to create a lastly change in that community. </p><p id=""yui_3_10_1_1_1398736029597_249193"">Since a majority of these buy one give one companies don't influence the symptoms of the problem they are donating to, I decided to take a stride in a new direction by not only donating a pair with every purchase to someone in your community here in the US, I am only donating these socks to programs that make lasting change in people lives over a structured program that influences people's interpersonal communication, coping skills and teaches job training . </p><p id=""yui_3_10_1_1_1398736029597_161563"">Due to what I now know, I renamed this 'cause-company' as TWOSOME, Sock Co. I wanted this cause-company to do better. I wanted to create something that actually influenced the system that created the problem of homelessness, not just the symptoms of being homeless. It maybe a tough concept for people to understand that poverty is that much of a problem within our own boarders, however the number speak for themselves: 1 in 6 here in the United States lives in poverty, and 10.5 million people are unemployed.<br style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;""/></p><p id=""yui_3_10_1_1_1398736029597_368331"">Armed with these stats, our mission is to lower the number of homeless and poverty stricken in the US by reintegrating individuals through a two year program, teaching them job, coping and interpersonal skills. We're not just giving the homeless a pair of socks, instead we are a small part to someone's overall transformation from living on the street off handouts, to someone who is self-sufficent and providing for their family.<br style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;""/></p><p id=""yui_3_10_1_1_1398736029597_339329"" style=""margin-bottom: 0px;"">With every pair of TWOSOME socks purchased, one pair will be donated to someone who is transforming their life. </p><p id=""yui_3_10_1_1_1398736029597_339329"" style=""margin-bottom: 0px;"">Initial Goals</p><p id=""yui_3_10_1_1_1398736029597_339329"" style=""margin-bottom: 0px;""></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/541286/files/20140428210521-Screen_shot_2014-04-28_at_9.04.14_PM.png?1398744321"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p>

manufactured. We are working with a manufacture company called Devmir, know
in the trade as ‘Socks with a Purpose’. Our manufacture company is committed to
producing high quality socks, using the finest materials and utilizing most
innovative sewing techniques, all while keeping sustainability and fair trade practices on the forefront of their decision making.</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""color: rgb(13, 16, 10); font-family: 'American Typewriter';""><b style=""font-weight: bold;"">Manufacturing </b><br/></span></p><font class=""Apple-style-span"" color=""#0d100a"">
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Our commitment to you is to produce a high quality sock that
you can wear numerous times without getting holes. Being that, we have chosen
the finest cotton and the most innovative designs to help support you feet. The
designs include breathable material to help keep your feet dry during the day,
and to stay warn at night. And know that annoying seam on the toe? We have changed
the way socks are stitched together to no longer create that seam on the toes. When
it comes to the heel, the socks are stitched in a ‘Y’ pattern, better cupping
and supporting your feet. Also, after months of testing, we have found the
perfect blend of cotton and nylon to help these socks stay up during the day, preventing
them from following down to your ankles.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><b>Design</b></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">With leading class manufacturing and materials secured, we
next focused our attention to the design. When shopping for dress socks, it’s
the same dark pattern everywhere we looked, or it was the outrageous color that
we couldn’t be proud to wear to work and have our boss see. So we have created
designs that are fresh, original and show off your individual personality, yet
stay in the acceptable range. We have partnered with designers from FIDM,
The Fashion Institute of Design &amp; Merchandising. FIDM is known for leading
fashion trends and world-class designers. By working in conjunction
with artists &amp; designers during the design process, we have created an amazing
products that you will love to wear and show off. You have be warned, these designs will
cause extreme jealously, and hopefully your spouse or roommate doesn’t take them after a
load of laundry.</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">At TWOSOME, we feel there’s more to life than just creating
a quality brand and buying an industry-leading product. We wanted our product
to give back to those in need, to be socially conscious like ourselves. So we
thought, TOMS does it for shoes, and Warby Parker for glasses, why
can’t we do it for socks.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">So we decided upon using the one for one business model.
However, instead of giving our donations to people overseas in Africa, or even
the homeless population that just wants a handout, we wanted our socks to truly make
a lasting impact in someone’s life. We wanted the donated socks to be more than
just a <i style="""">band-aid</i>, to actually influence
the system, and to get people here, in our community back on their feet to
work.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><b>A Hand-Up, Over A Hand Out</b></p>

provide soup and meals for the homeless. Jim Palmer and his crew of dedicated
individuals give more than just a hand out, they give a <i style="""">hand up</i>. By taking in hundreds of Men, Women, Families and Children for 18

<p class=""MsoNormal"">We love how much the OC Rescue Mission does for people that

into becoming a productive member of society, however, it is one less barrier
that person will have to face. So, with every purchase of TWOSOME socks, we
will donate a pair on your behalf TWOSOME one who deserves a second chance.

<p></p><p></p><p></p></div>","Hi, my name is Eric. I (officially) started this company back in February 2014. Then called Harvey Harper, this started as a concept to create socks that expressed my personality while at work. While on the search for socks that were both fun yet professional, all I could find were boring dark dress socks or the one's with the bright colors and patterns. So I set to work creating a sock that would turn heads, just not my bosses. As I researched other designs and companies, I noticed a theme with how clothing businesses operated. One, they mass producing products into 'small batches' at large profit margins. Secondly, they follow the buy one give one 'marketing' approach. Being a conscious consumer, I am constantly looking for ways to value my purchasing power, and try to mainly buy from companies that are local, follow fair trade practices and give back. While I appreciate the steps these social companies have taken so far, a majority of these buy one give one companies fall short with their donation side when making a lasting impact in my community. The item they donate goes to third world countries, which is a step in some direction, however, mostly these types of donations are a handout only program without actually impacting the system to create a lastly change in that community. Since a majority of these buy one give one companies don't influence the symptoms of the problem they are donating to, I decided to take a stride in a new direction by not only donating a pair with every purchase to someone in your community here in the US, I am only donating these socks to programs that make lasting change in people lives over a structured program that influences people's interpersonal communication, coping skills and teaches job training . Due to what I now know, I renamed this 'cause-company' as TWOSOME, Sock Co. I wanted this cause-company to do better. I wanted to create something that actually influenced the system that created the problem of homelessness, not just the symptoms of being homeless. It maybe a tough concept for people to understand that poverty is that much of a problem within our own boarders, however the number speak for themselves: 1 in 6 here in the United States lives in poverty, and 10.5 million people are unemployed.Armed with these stats, our mission is to lower the number of homeless and poverty stricken in the US by reintegrating individuals through a two year program, teaching them job, coping and interpersonal skills. We're not just giving the homeless a pair of socks, instead we are a small part to someone's overall transformation from living on the street off handouts, to someone who is self-sufficent and providing for their family.With every pair of TWOSOME socks purchased, one pair will be donated to someone who is transforming their life. Initial Goals
TWOSOME,
Sock Co. produces business casual dress socks that are artist designed,  expertly manufactured and distributed to those in need. Our mission is to provide quality designer socks
that influence the system of homelessness, not just the symptoms of being
homeless. We have strategic partners in manufacturing, design, distribution and
charity outreach that will lower the barrier to self-sufficiency through
the purchase of the best socks you will ever own.

This is How We Are Changing Lives:Fair Trade PracticesFirst, and foremost, we are starting with how the socks are
manufactured. We are working with a manufacture company called Devmir, know

<p>Aerogel, in geek terminology, is the lowest thermal conductive solid on the planet. Put simply, that means aerogel is the best insulator in existence!</p>
<p>Today, aerogel is used by NASA as insulation in their space suits. It can trap space dust on space shuttles, de-ice aircrafts, and insulate some of the coldest oil pipelines in the world.
Aerogel is also very light. In fact, it would take 150 brick-sized pieces of aerogel to weigh as much as a single gallon of water!
So what does all this mean? When you invest in OROS performance apparel, you get a thin and warm garment that even the astronauts would be proud of. </p>

<p> Michael, Rithvik, and Max (left to right) are lifelong friends who share passions for two things: Science &amp; Adventure. By uniting the two, they believe they can change the way people think about outerwear and performance wear. </p>
<h1>WHY WE MAKE OUTERWEAR: </h1>
<p>Science gets a bad rap. Many believe science can't be sexy. Well, OROS thinks otherwise. We appreciate the flowing locks of Albert Einstein and find talks on epigenetics to be stimulating. We believe in challenging the status quo and pushing the boundaries of what is possible. Using the same technology applied by the National Aeronautics and Space Agency (NASA) as insulation in their space suits, we made outerwear slimmer, warmer and sexier. Besides, it's the 21st century. Aren't we beyond wrapping ourselves in animal furs and goose feathers? </p>
<h1>OROS: </h1>

<p>OROS means mountain in Greek. But more than the gargantuan mass of land a rock formed by the clash of Earth's tectonic plates, OROS represents the challenge - and the accomplishment. The journey and the conquest. And the ultimate joy in achievement.</p>

<p>Our team consists of experts in industries ranging from fashion and design to apparel and aerogel engineering.</p>
<p>We are all here to make sure the Orion series lives up to its name and you get your gear on time.</p>
<p>Here is our plan to achieve that:</p>
<p><b>February/March</b>: Make tons of Indiegogo buddies, finalize the engineering and prototyping iterations, quality assurance, product validation</p>
<p><b>April-July</b>: Procurement of raw materials and components, shipping of aerogel to apparel manufacturer, begin manufacturing</p>
<p><b>July-September</b>: Conclude manufacturing, shipping of finalized product to distributor</p>
<p><b>October</b>: Delivery of jackets to Indiegogo friends and fulfillment of rewards!</p>
</div>
</div>","We're back and better than ever!
One year ago you supported our vision to make the world’s thinnest, warmest jacket — a jacket insulated with NASA spacesuit technology. The crowdfunding community and our early adopters believed in us before anyone else even knew we existed. You blew us away with your support and kicked off a worldwide movement!

Now we're back. And this time, we mean business. 





The Orion Series can take you from the top of a mountain, back home, and everywhere in between. 





 
Traditional outerwear is cumbersome and boring! You have to wear big, bulky clothes and plenty of layers just to stay warm. 
What if you could wear thin gear with no layers and be perfectly warm whether you were on top of a mountain or relaxing with your friends? Using the same insulation NASA used in their space suits and space shuttles, OROS brings you its line of thin, warm performance apparel. No layers. No compromises. 




















Aerogel, in geek terminology, is the lowest thermal conductive solid on the planet. Put simply, that means aerogel is the best insulator in existence!
Today, aerogel is used by NASA as insulation in their space suits. It can trap space dust on space shuttles, de-ice aircrafts, and insulate some of the coldest oil pipelines in the world.
Aerogel is also very light. In fact, it would take 150 brick-sized pieces of aerogel to weigh as much as a single gallon of water!
So what does all this mean? When you invest in OROS performance apparel, you get a thin and warm garment that even the astronauts would be proud of. 





Solarcore Aerogel:
We use a proprietary formulation of aerogel called Solarcore. It is the first aerogel suited for apparel with its incredible flexibility, hydrophobicity, durability, sound absorbency, and breathability all while maintaining the incredible insulation that aerogels are known for. 





Jacket:





 Available in Black & Blue

The OROS Team:





 Michael, Rithvik, and Max (left to right) are lifelong friends who share passions for two things: Science & Adventure. By uniting the two, they believe they can change the way people think about outerwear and performance wear. 
WHY WE MAKE OUTERWEAR: 
Science gets a bad rap. Many believe science can't be sexy. Well, OROS thinks otherwise. We appreciate the flowing locks of Albert Einstein and find talks on epigenetics to be stimulating. We believe in challenging the status quo and pushing the boundaries of what is possible. Using the same technology applied by the National Aeronautics and Space Agency (NASA) as insulation in their space suits, we made outerwear slimmer, warmer and sexier. Besides, it's the 21st century. Aren't we beyond wrapping ourselves in animal furs and goose feathers? 
OROS: 





OROS means mountain in Greek. But more than the gargantuan mass of land a rock formed by the clash of Earth's tectonic plates, OROS represents the challenge - and the accomplishment. The journey and the conquest. And the ultimate joy in achievement.
Reward Tiers:





Help us by sharing OROS Performance apparel with your friends!

<figure style=""margin: 0px;""><h3>Our Mission</h3>
<p></p>
<p>To offer a quick and simple protection method for smartphones and tablets utilizing effortless technology that anyone can use.</p>
<h3>What is the problem?</h3>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Screen protectors are historically grueling to install. It is a difficult task to align the protector properly so that it goes on evenly. Constantly removing and repositioning the protector causes it to bend and trap dust and air bubbles.</p></figure><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><h3>Patented Position-Lock Design solves the Problem!</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Simple Snap™ comes with a disposable mold that fits perfectly around the device. Simply push the mold over the device until it snaps off and leaves the screen protector flawlessly installed within 0.1mm precision.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>What have we done with OUR money?</h3>
<p>So far we have invested our money into R&amp;D, Tooling (patented mold), and the development of the product brand.  </p>
<p>We have also self-funded the initial sample production run.</p>
<h3>What will we do with YOUR money?</h3>
<p><strong>Manufacturing</strong> - We will be increasing the product line and will allocate funds to allow for tooling of several additional smartphone and tablet models.  Pledgers will be able to vote on the next devices they want to see with a Simple Snap™ mold!</p>
<p><strong>Distribution</strong> - We want to extend our distribution channels through ecommerce and retail outlets such as BestBuy, RadioShack, Target, Wal-Mart and GameStop.  </p>
<p><strong>Marketing</strong> - In order to build upon our momentum, we need you to tell your family &amp; friends  The easiest way to do that is through social media: Post about Simple Snap™ on Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin, YouTube and Instagram!  We are launching several marketing campaigns to assist with spreading the word via social media.</p>

</div></div>","Simple Snap™ comes with a patented mold that fits perfectly around your device allowing for a flawless bubble-free installation.The first screen protector was designed and patented by Herbert Schlegel in 1968 for use on television screens.  Since that time many innovations have been made to improve the quality of the screen protector, but little has been made to improve on the ease of installation.  If you have ever installed a screen protector, you understand the frustration of aligning it properly and keeping all of the dust and dirt off so you can have a bubble free installation.
Our Mission

To offer a quick and simple protection method for smartphones and tablets utilizing effortless technology that anyone can use.
What is the problem?


Screen protectors are historically grueling to install. It is a difficult task to align the protector properly so that it goes on evenly. Constantly removing and repositioning the protector causes it to bend and trap dust and air bubbles.Patented Position-Lock Design solves the Problem!

Simple Snap™ comes with a disposable mold that fits perfectly around the device. Simply push the mold over the device until it snaps off and leaves the screen protector flawlessly installed within 0.1mm precision.

What have we done with OUR money?
So far we have invested our money into R&D, Tooling (patented mold), and the development of the product brand.  
We have also self-funded the initial sample production run.
What will we do with YOUR money?
Manufacturing - We will be increasing the product line and will allocate funds to allow for tooling of several additional smartphone and tablet models.  Pledgers will be able to vote on the next devices they want to see with a Simple Snap™ mold!
Distribution - We want to extend our distribution channels through ecommerce and retail outlets such as BestBuy, RadioShack, Target, Wal-Mart and GameStop.  
Marketing - In order to build upon our momentum, we need you to tell your family & friends  The easiest way to do that is through social media: Post about Simple Snap™ on Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin, YouTube and Instagram!  We are launching several marketing campaigns to assist with spreading the word via social media.


With your funding you will get yourself one of the very first production Simple Snap™ protectors by or before September 2014.


All contributions include FREE shipping within the USA! 
Please add the $10 International Shipping perk for all locations outside of the USA.

<p>Fabric of your regular clothes hasn’t changed, in like “forever”?</p>
<p>Probably not forever, but during the last decades there hasn’t
been much of a change in your everyday apparel, except for the
looks of course!
</p>
<p>Sports clothes industry is changing their material all the time and
new innovative fabrics are used by every major sporting good
manufacturer. However, your everyday t-shirt, sweater, skirt or
pair of pants hasn’t changed a bit. </p>

<div>TextilCure creates a permanent, transparent and ultra-thin layer on nearly any fabric. It actually does not just lay on top of the fabric, but merges with each fiber to create an amazing water resistant, oil resistant and dirt repellent surface. It is easy applicable, just spray it on or soak the fabric in. As soon as the fa- bric is really dry the effect can be seen and your favorite t-shirt is super-hydrophobic.<br/>Our product is bio based. It is absolutely not harmful or dangerous to you, your skin or the environment. It is also UV-resistant, so it is safe to use. It is machi- ne washable for up to 40 times, depending on how consistent the fabric is covered /soaked. It is also washable in the hot water laundry program.<div>You have seen something similar? Nice, means you’re open to innovation. But are similar products truly fully transparent? Isn’t there a slightly frosted look to it and would you want your brand new clothes to look like that?</div>

<div>Our journey began one and a half years ago during our studies. Throughout the last year of our studies, we have encountered this absolutely amazing technology and our interest was caught straight away. Ever since, we have been looking for, researching on and developing special solutions for many different sectors. Due to our amazement and the constant inquiries by friends, colleagues and family, we have decided to share our latest, fascinating product not only with the industry, but with everyone. </div>

<p>We give people access to this kind of technology, because
there is an actual need for it. Somehow the big players in the
textile industry see no reward in publishing such a product,
because planned obsolescence does not allow for clothing to be
worn more than one season.

or buy. Wear your favorite piece of clothing whenever you want
to, all seasons long. </p>

<p>First and foremost, the production of this product is fairly expensive. It’s a cool, innovative, game changing liquid, but quality
comes at a price. We need some inventory to fulfill orders and to
stock for the opening of our webshop. Further to get into retail
we need to be flexible in our production and able to fulfill mini-
mum order quantities.
</p>
<p>Secondly, you probably guessed right, we need to get our
webshop going. Coding, publishing and marketing are the three
major matters of expenses on this account.
</p>
<p>As you can see on our website, so far we have tried different
angles to approach our clients and that was mostly regional
marketing in Germany and surrounding Europe. Therefore we
have to extend and amend our website.
</p>
<p>Last but not least we have to market our idea and most marketing
ideas cost at least a little. Professional video material is key, as
our products have to be visualized to be understood by the broad
mass.

<p>This list gives you an insight, without boring you with the details. </p>

Fabric of your regular clothes hasn’t changed, in like “forever”?
Probably not forever, but during the last decades there hasn’t
been much of a change in your everyday apparel, except for the
looks of course!

Sports clothes industry is changing their material all the time and
new innovative fabrics are used by every major sporting good
manufacturer. However, your everyday t-shirt, sweater, skirt or
pair of pants hasn’t changed a bit. 

















Why buy a rain jacket, if you can wear your favorite sweater all
year?

Why ruin your favorite shirt with nasty red wine or beer stains
during a night out in town?

Why have a spare shirt in the office just in case you spill your
drink or food during lunchtime?

Why wear plastic bags or other “stupid-looking” plastic covers
at festivals?

Why dry your swim shorts for so long on the beach?
Why have you never been in the shower all suited up? 














Simply modify your clothing’s fabric structure. 
Cure it - from its boring, ordinary existence. Cure it - to become extraordinary, exceptional Cure it - to become something unique and exciting! 








Let’s cure our favorite clothing with an amazing clothing impregnation – TextilCure 












Nearly every piece of fabric. You’ll probably know best. To stir your imagination we mention just a few of the sheer possibilities: 
















And for the hipster amongst you: 



Why not protect your MacBook with a super-hydrophobic tote bag? 











TextilCure creates a permanent, transparent and ultra-thin layer on nearly any fabric. It actually does not just lay on top of the fabric, but merges with each fiber to create an amazing water resistant, oil resistant and dirt repellent surface. It is easy applicable, just spray it on or soak the fabric in. As soon as the fa- bric is really dry the effect can be seen and your favorite t-shirt is super-hydrophobic.Our product is bio based. It is absolutely not harmful or dangerous to you, your skin or the environment. It is also UV-resistant, so it is safe to use. It is machi- ne washable for up to 40 times, depending on how consistent the fabric is covered /soaked. It is also washable in the hot water laundry program.You have seen something similar? Nice, means you’re open to innovation. But are similar products truly fully transparent? Isn’t there a slightly frosted look to it and would you want your brand new clothes to look like that?














nanoCure is a start-up company that focuses on providing high-performance, industrial nanotechnology coatings for commercial and private use.
Our journey began one and a half years ago during our studies. Throughout the last year of our studies, we have encountered this absolutely amazing technology and our interest was caught straight away. Ever since, we have been looking for, researching on and developing special solutions for many different sectors. Due to our amazement and the constant inquiries by friends, colleagues and family, we have decided to share our latest, fascinating product not only with the industry, but with everyone. 













We give people access to this kind of technology, because
there is an actual need for it. Somehow the big players in the
textile industry see no reward in publishing such a product,
because planned obsolescence does not allow for clothing to be
worn more than one season.

Don’t be restricted to what the textile industry wants you to wear
or buy. Wear your favorite piece of clothing whenever you want
to, all seasons long. 

















First and foremost, the production of this product is fairly expensive. It’s a cool, innovative, game changing liquid, but quality
comes at a price. We need some inventory to fulfill orders and to
stock for the opening of our webshop. Further to get into retail
we need to be flexible in our production and able to fulfill mini-
mum order quantities.

Secondly, you probably guessed right, we need to get our
webshop going. Coding, publishing and marketing are the three
major matters of expenses on this account.

As you can see on our website, so far we have tried different
angles to approach our clients and that was mostly regional
marketing in Germany and surrounding Europe. Therefore we
have to extend and amend our website.

Last but not least we have to market our idea and most marketing
ideas cost at least a little. Professional video material is key, as
our products have to be visualized to be understood by the broad
mass.

This list gives you an insight, without boring you with the details. 









Ok, we'll show you some details; 
We're really not here to make a quick buck or two by just selling our product. We put a lot of effort, money and time into our products and the graphic below will show you how your money will be spent.  









As we want to build the backend for a customer product, we don’t
want you to feel left out.
That’s why we offer you our products for a pioneer / indiegogo
price.

The concentrate can be mixed 1:20 - 1:25 with distilled water, depending on the fabric. The 20ml perk can be mixed with 500ml - 1⁄2
Liter distilled water. Further details will follow on the user manual.
















As you’ve probably seen from our location, we are a Hamburg,
Germany based company. For that reason we have to add a ship-
ping fee to some international orders.
Please, if you’re not from the EU or USA or Canada, just contact
us and we’ll find out how much it is.",38.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">I always wanted to do something original.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">I developed my aesthetic code in a life of artistic experiments, from novel-writing to painting, to being a musician, composer and finally designer.</span></p>

<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1473087055/Simone_in_Iris_studio_wzcok2.png"" src="""" style=""letter-spacing: 0px;width: 488.52px;height: 275px;background-color: initial;""/>   With Suzy Menkes, while working in Iris van Herpen's studio</blockquote>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Working first in a small tailoring studio in my hometown, after my graduation in Fashion Design in Rome I attended short courses at the Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design in London. I then pursued my dream of working with some of my favourite designers, first for dutch designer Iris Van Herpen and then for Paris-based designer Rick Owens. </span></p>
<p>All these working experiences contributed to form and influence my aesthetic and brought me a post-avantgarde vision on modern fashion, and I felt confident enough to bring those visions to reality.</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">So SIMONE CHAP was born.</span></p>

Simone Chap is an international brand with an italian soul.
With designs focused on pret-a-porter with couture elements, and using the best italian fabrics and materials, Simone mixes the old-fashioned italian couture techniques with a post-avantgarde aesthetic and modern technologies, to create wearable contemporary art pieces.

M Y   S T O R Y
I always wanted to do something original.
I developed my aesthetic code in a life of artistic experiments, from novel-writing to painting, to being a musician, composer and finally designer.

   With Suzy Menkes, while working in Iris van Herpen's studio
Working first in a small tailoring studio in my hometown, after my graduation in Fashion Design in Rome I attended short courses at the Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design in London. I then pursued my dream of working with some of my favourite designers, first for dutch designer Iris Van Herpen and then for Paris-based designer Rick Owens. 
All these working experiences contributed to form and influence my aesthetic and brought me a post-avantgarde vision on modern fashion, and I felt confident enough to bring those visions to reality.
So SIMONE CHAP was born.

The DARK MATTER Collection is a journey in our little universe, to discover the invisible dark matter that rules our consciousness.
A subtle, dark structure that can only be perceived through the effects it has on the other surrounding matter.

The invisible and obscure matter finds his form in dark fabrics, and the hand-crafted manipulated silk recalls the chaos theory, while layers and folds are shaped on wormholes and space-time alterations.
 
T H E   C A M P A I G N
After working in major fashion brands, I decided to finally launch my own designs, bringing on the market high-quality products that combine a fashion-forward design and a luxury craftmanship.
 
The funds raised through the campaign will be used for the opening of our new studio, for the development of our next collection, expected for March 2017, and for the basic forniture and essential expenses.



 
The main features of the project are:


U N I Q U E N E S S
The DARK MATTER collection is being launched exclusively here on Indiegogo, so you get something that has never been seen before anywhere else!
 

C U T T I N G - E D G E   D E S I G N 


There is no space for basics. Detailed textures and sharp edges, yet with a minimalistic aura.
 

L O C A L L Y   S O U R C E D


Our fabrics are sourced in italian factories that are still using traditional techniques, delivering the best quality on the market.
 

H A N D - C R A F T E D 

We mixed the best traditional italian sewing techniques with a hint of technology, to deliver impeccable hand-crafted fabrics and details.
 
 

N O   R E T A I L
You buy directly from the designer's studio, cutting out the retail middlemen.  In this way you get the same outstanding quality and save a minimum of 40%!
 
 
P E R K S
We made available a small selection of our first collection for this campaign, including some unisex pieces (see the size chart at the bottom for size details)
For more pictures at higher resolution have a look at the gallery at the top of the page.

All the pieces are hand-crafted with the maximum care, and include premium packaging to deliver a truly luxurious experience to your hands.
Also, all our backers will become part of our new studio! We will hang on the wall a framed art with the names of all our backers, to show you eternal gratitude!

<h3>Why support Manaliso?</h3>
<p><strong>Still #topless?</strong> In a nutshell.</p>
<p>Let’s be honest: For how many of your clothing pieces you can claim they have been produced fair and organic. We think the time to compromise is over. We want to create fashion without compromises. What’s in for you?</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1480012616/grtchskyb4beushnnmjv.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>Warum solltest du uns unterstützen?</h3>
<p><strong>Immer noch #obenohne? </strong><i>Auf den Punkt.</i></p>
<p><i>Hand aufs Herz: Von wie vielen Kleidungsstücken kannst du behaupten, sie mit guten Gewissen zu tragen? Wir finden, die Zeit für Kompromisse ist vorbei. Wir haben uns daher das Ziel gesetzt, Mode zu entwickeln, bei der du keine eingehen musst. Was bedeutet das für dich?</i></p>

Help us to start the production of our new collection.
We finished our new 100% fair, 100% organic and 100% vegan collection “All I Sea”. With this crowdfunding campaign, we collect enough advance orders to start the production. We will use the raised sum completely for our production. You will learn on this page, why backing this campaign is so important and how backing in general works.
 

 
Manaliso entwickelt nachhaltige Mode, die keine Kompromisse mehr bei Stil, Fairness, Gesundheit oder Umwelt macht.
 
Hilf uns, unsere neue Kollektion zu produzieren!
Wir haben unsere neue, 100% faire, 100% bio und 100% vegane Kollektion “All I Sea” fertig. Wir nutzen unsere Crowdfunding-Kampagne, um genug Vorbestellungen für die Produktion zu sammeln. Die komplette, gesammelte Summe werden wir direkt in die Produktion investieren. Warum das so wichtig ist und wie der Ablauf funktioniert, erfährst du auf dieser Kampagnenseite.
 




 

Why support Manaliso?
Still #topless? In a nutshell.
Let’s be honest: For how many of your clothing pieces you can claim they have been produced fair and organic. We think the time to compromise is over. We want to create fashion without compromises. What’s in for you?

Warum solltest du uns unterstützen?
Immer noch #obenohne? Auf den Punkt.
Hand aufs Herz: Von wie vielen Kleidungsstücken kannst du behaupten, sie mit guten Gewissen zu tragen? Wir finden, die Zeit für Kompromisse ist vorbei. Wir haben uns daher das Ziel gesetzt, Mode zu entwickeln, bei der du keine eingehen musst. Was bedeutet das für dich?





The Deal (Unser Angebot)
With help of the advance orders we can start the product and, at the same time, offer you a big discount. For you, there’s no risk, if the campaign doesn’t succeed, everyone gets their money back!
Durch die Vorbestellungen können wir die Produktion starten und euch gleichzeitig noch ‘nen dicken Rabatt geben. Für euch gibt es dabei kein Risiko. Falls wir das Ziel nicht erreichen, erhalten alle ihr Geld zurück!













Which size do i need and how do i measure right?
Take one of your textiles, where you like the shape. You can then compare the measurements with our sizes.
Chest width: Begin about 2.5 cm (1 inch) below one armpit and measure the length horizontally to the other armpit.
Torso length: Measure the length from the collar vertically to the end of the shirt.
Sleeve length: For a shirt with long sleeves, you can measure the sleeve length. To do this, simply measure the distance between the collar and the end of the sleeve.
 
Welche Größe benötige ich und Wie messe ich richtig?
Nimm dir eins deiner Textilien, bei dem dir der Schnitt gefällt. Die Messungen kannst du dann mit unseren Werten vergleichen.
Brustbreite: Setze das Maßband ca. 2,5 cm unter den Achseln an und lege es möglichst horizontal bis zur anderen Seite. 
Rumpflänge: Um die Rumpflänge zu messen, setzt du das Maßband am äußersten Kragenrand an und misst möglichst senkrecht bis zum Ende des Textils.
Ärmellänge: Bei einem Textil mit langen Ärmeln, kannst du auch die Ärmellänge messen. Setze das Maßband am Kragen des Textiles an und messe bis zum Ende des Ärmels.

With every perk you buy you'll get a digital certificate you can print and use as a gift as well.Wir benötigen mindestens 25.000 €, um die Produktion zu starten.

By the age of 14, when I was competing in rodeo queen pageants and horse shows, I was sketching my own outfits and costumes with a retro-glamour nod. My mom, who was an amazing seamstress, took my sketches and modified patterns to create my visions. My dad even helped by hand-cutting leather fringe and installing intricate beading. These original designs garnered a lot of positive attention and I sold every piece in my wardrobe.  </p><p>At the age of 25, I resurrected my love for fashion design when I started making my own elaborate Halloween costumes and stage wear. I focused on creating flowing, comfortable sundresses for the hot Texas weather as I was touring and singing in Americana bands. Finding high-quality, vibrant fabrics that were comfortable and didn't wrinkle was paramount, and I scoured shops in the garment district in New York to find the perfect textile blends. </p><p>Before long, I was making dresses for my friends and family and started an Etsy shop. Within a matter of months, I was designing and sewing hundreds of dresses fulltime on Etsy for clients all over the world. Now at 37, I have my first bricks-and-mortar shop in my hometown of Boise, Idaho, and have been loving the opportunities the new space has given me. I've had the amazing fortune to work with women of all ages and walks of life to create special gowns for celebratory events and cherished moments. I currently create more than 400 dresses a year for my store and online sales, and I have a vision to expand even more into the bridal and special event space.  That’s where you come in. </p><p><strong>Why This Matters</strong></p><p>It's so important to me to create this new capsule collection because it is something greatly missing in the bridal space. Every day, I hear from brides and bridesmaids that “nothing ever fits me” or “I can’t find dresses to satisfy everyone in my bridal party."" Most big bridal stores offer dress lines with limited sizing or fabric choices and very often someone is having to squeeze into something frustrating, uncomfortable and too expensive. That shouldn’t be! No woman should ever have to feel excluded simply because of her proportions, age, or preferences. This new line has been percolating in my creative mind for quite some time and I'm excited to finally be able to bring it to you and women like you. Each woman I design for has a different aesthetic and body shape, and these new, flexible designs are the culmination of the feedback I've gotten from my clients over the past several years. There is no such thing as one-size-fits-all. But now, there can be something that is the perfect fit for everyone!</p><p>Body-positive empowerment starts with loving the skin you’re in, and I aim to make each gown more comfortable and beautiful than you will ever imagine a special event gown to be. My new offering is a customized capsule collection that allows each client to choose from a variety of necklines, waist options, and skirt styles to fit and flatter her unique body type and shape. You’ll be able to design your perfect gown which will then be made to your measurements. Brides will be able to provide their bridesmaids with an extremely flattering and unique dress that still offers a uniform concept for her dream wedding. This collection is one of a kind—beautiful dresses designed by you, in high quality fabrics with a fit that is customized to your exact measurements. Designed by you, lovingly made for you. </p><p>In addition to raising funds for my new dress line, I will also be contributing portions of your donations to the Miss Amazing Pageant, a grassroots organization that provides opportunities for girls and women with disabilities to build confidence and self-esteem in a supportive environment.

</ul><p><strong>The Impact</strong></p><p>Many online sites including Etsy recently started selling extremely cheap knock-off versions of designer’s fashions for a tiny fraction of the price. This new way of “buying dresses” has hit a lot of US designers hard, myself included. To compete with Chinese manufacturers, one simply cannot pay a seamstress a living wage in the United States. It’s time for me to push back.  Supporting items Made in America is crucial, and I am committed to keeping this standard in my company. I make almost every dress that I’ve sold, or I work closely with US-based designers and seamstresses to create the looks I send out. My new capsule collection, like all of my previous collections, will be 100% Made in the USA. Let’s keep it that way! </p><p>Each time I have launched a small dress collection on Etsy or in store, I’ve sold completely out of the item within the year. I have a classic design aesthetic with a modern/edgy flare and it continues to build in popularity the more designs I come up with. From a dining room table to my downtown boutique, I’ve grown so tremendously in the past five years. I need your help to make it to the next phase!</p><p>One of my biggest sources of pride is my reputation for creating new and exciting designs and for making sure my clients are incredibly happy with the looks I create. I work extra hours and extremely hard to give my clients exactly what they’re envisioning and I couldn’t be happier with what I’ve accomplished so far.</p><p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p><p>Upswings as well as downturns are all too common for small businesses and I’ve weathered plenty of them. Facing down the massive overseas manufacturers is daunting, but I am confident that my quality and commitment to excellent products will prevail with your help. Customers will always have the option to buy the cheaply made, inexpensive products; but I’m determined to give them the option to spend their money in the USA and support a product that is well-made and custom-designed for them.</p><p>As always, with more business comes more work!

<p>We designed MYNT to be an integral part of your key ring, bag, or purse. The thin body allows MYNT to be slipped into your wallet or luggage. MYNT can also be attached to your camera, passport, laptop, pet collar, and pretty much anything you can imagine.

</p><p>When you report a lost tag with the MYNT app, all MYNT users around the globe can help you. Each phone with the MYNT app installed can detect a tracker within 150 feet. This means you benefit from a network supported by hundreds of thousands of people: CrowdGPS. The MYNT app includes community support features. Once an MYNT is reported lost, the information is passed on to all other MYNT users, and those with the community function enabled will be able to help locate the lost tag if it comes within range of any MYNT user. Once the MYNT app detects a lost item, the whereabouts will be sent to your phone instantly.</p><p></p><h3>Why We Need Your Support</h3><p>MYNT is ready for production. We can't stand for anything that's not perfect – we designed MYNT to be just 1/8 inch thick, something deemed impossible without sacrificing performance like battery life and alarm volume. </p><p>We are doing an Indiegogo campaign because we believe that you are our best possible early adopters. We'll ship MYNT as soon as the campaign ends.</p><p>With your help, we will be able to add more smart functions. We will make connection with Xbox, smart refrigerators, cars, and you name it smart device possible. We need your help so we can constantly improve the functionality of MYNT and release updated versions, which can be easily upgraded over the air. MYNT will evolve into a smart swiss army button that fits your needs in unimaginable ways. With you help, together, we can make MYNT even better.</p>

<p><a href=""https://vimeo.com/137224716"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Testimonial video</a>:  This is cool, I actually just got my Tile last week, and (comparing with MYNT) it feels kind of fat. I like that I can actually use it for presentations, I like that I can use it for taking photos. It’s pretty handy, especially the size.</p>

When they told me they were going to create MYNT with a stainless steel body, I said ""don’t do that, use plastic, because solving antenna problems with a metal body is a very challenging and difficult task"". Ultimately, when I got the working sample, I was shocked! It's really well crafted -- looks great -- and the antenna works perfectly.</p><p></p><h3>User Testimonial</h3><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2F06QrUkfX7WM%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D06QrUkfX7WM&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F06QrUkfX7WM%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p>

<p><b></b></p><p><b>How many MYNTs can be handeled through the App? </b></p><p></p><p>We support up to 8 MYNTs in our app.</p><p style=""display: inline !important;""><b>How far back to you support ios? Will it work with an iPhone 4 (not the 4s)?</b></p><p></p><p></p><p>It has to be iPhone 4s or later, since iPhone 4 doesn't support Bluetooth 4.0.</p><p><b>How do you manage “geo-fencing” to have a good mix between “do not forget your keys when you leave the house” AND “it does not ring when you go to the next room”?</b></p><p><b><b></b></b></p><p>We have a feature, called ""safe zone"". You can set your home or office as safe zone, so you will get a warning when you forget your key when you leave house, but won't ring when you go to the other room.</p><b></b><p><b>Will this work without GPS enabled on your phone? I assume the close proximity alerts will still function if Bluetooth is on, but I'm unsure how regular GPS factors in. Would having Bluetooth on and no GPS mean that groupGps is useless?</b></p><p>If you turn the GPS off, all of the functions are still working, just it won't record the location of your item on map. </p><p><b>What are the limited connections required for his app to function?</b></p><p>Just Bluetooth. </p><p><b>Could you explain the GroupGPS more clearly for me? Is the Regular GPS in a phone only used for this part? Do other users that use GroupGPS know where your lost item is if you decide to announce something as lost? Is there the potential that someone could use GroupGPS and steal lost items?</b></p><p>They won't know. Their phone will detect the missing MYNT when it's close by, then such info will be sent to our server, and we will pass it to you. </p><p><b>Is there a way to allow certain users (one's you deem as friends potentially) to help get alerts about your specific missing item?</b></p><p>Yes, we are working on this feature - to allow all people or certain people to get alerts.</p><p></p><p><b>Can you tell me the range of the MYNT GPS or Bluetooth range? </b><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">It showed that you can track you back to your parked car but wanted to know how far you can be.</b></p><p></p><p>The MYNT Bluetooth range is about 150 feet in open space, but when it's blocked by metal, it's short. It uses GPS on your smart phone to record the last lost signal location. So, when you have MYNT in your car, once you leave your car, the MYNT app in your smartphone will record your car parking location. Later on you can check it on the map of MYNT app to find your car.</p><div><p><b>What is the “Out of range” distance (left keys on restaurant table) before the “out of range alarm” goes off on my iPhone? A<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">lso, how will this lead me back to the lost item which is attached to MYNT? (GPS function )</span></b></p></div>""Out of range"" mean the Bluetooth loses signal. This can be 30 feet to 150 feet depending the obstacles between MYNT and your smartphone. <p>One you get an alarm, you can first look at the lost location from the map in the MYNT app. Once you get closer to your lost item location, MYNT will automatically connect to your smartphone again. Then you can get even closer to your lost item by looking at the signal of the Bluetooth in the MYNT app. You can also let MYT buzz and flash from that MYNT app, that will help you eventually find your lost item.</p><p></p><p><b>Please let us know if you have any questions, comments/suggestions or ideas!</b></p>

Features


Out-of-range alarm: never leave your valuables behindAttach MYNT to your valuables. Your smartphone will alert you if you leave your keys or wallet behind, or your puppy runs away in the park while you are talking to someone.
Out-of-range alarm: never lose your phone
Left your phone on the coffee table? Forgot to take your phone with you when running out of the house? This won’t happen again. MYNT is a bi-directional tracker. It will prevent you from losing your phone thanks to its built-in buzzer. You can configure MYNT to beep if you forget your phone.  In addition, MYNT  can help you find your phone as a reverse tracker. Press and hold the button on your MYNT to make your phone ring. The phone will vibrate and ring even if set to Silent mode. Never has it been so easy to find your phone hiding under the sofa or in your car.
Find phone and other items
Keep track of your purse, keys, and phone around the house.

Locate your car easily

MYNT makes finding your car easier than ever: it saves your parking location and gives you walking directions back to your car.Take selfies
Want to take a selfie or group photo? Want to take a jump shot? You can use MYNT to remote control your cell phone camera and capture that special moment -- from any angle, at any time. Free your hands and take memorable selfies wherever, whenever -- it's a great alternative to the dreaded selfie stick.

Control your musicIf you enjoy listening to music on your phone or tablet, MYNT lets you control your music from anywhere in your house.Presentation remote

Just install the Mac app and press or double press MYNT's button to move to the next or previous slide in your PowerPoint or Keynote presentations.



Design and manufacturing
We designed MYNT to be an integral part of your key ring, bag, or purse. The thin body allows MYNT to be slipped into your wallet or luggage. MYNT can also be attached to your camera, passport, laptop, pet collar, and pretty much anything you can imagine. You won't even notice it when placed in your wallet. MYNT is manufactured using state-of-the-art processes. MYNT's metal body is finished with the same anodizing process as the iPhone 6; the stainless steel used for MYNT is actually processed in the same furnaces as the material used for the iPhone 6.


As thin as a sheet of bubble gum

1/8-inch thick and 2 inches long.(3.5 mm and 55mm, respectively). MYNT fits easily inside any wallet and the stainless steel construction is extremely durable.
Long battery life

Replaceable battery  + long battery + smart battery reminder
MYNT’s standard CR2020 battery lasts up to 1 year. It's smart battery reminder will notify you when your battery starts running low. Each package comes with one replacement battery.
Multi-platform experience



MYNT currently supports iOS, Android, and Mac OS X. The hardware combines seamlessly with the software to provide the best user experience.
The package
It includes one MYNT tag with a standard CR2020 battery pre-installed, one extra battery, one easy to attach strap, and two adhesive pads.

Dimensions




Colors
MYNT comes in four different colors: silver (brushed), black (sand-blasted), gold (mirror), and blue (mirror). If you plan to use MYNT on a key ring, we recommend getting the silver (brushed) or black (sand-blasted) models, which are more scratch-resistant.

CrowdGPS: our global support community (compatible with communities of other tracker brands)



When you report a lost tag with the MYNT app, all MYNT users around the globe can help you. Each phone with the MYNT app installed can detect a tracker within 150 feet. This means you benefit from a network supported by hundreds of thousands of people: CrowdGPS. The MYNT app includes community support features. Once an MYNT is reported lost, the information is passed on to all other MYNT users, and those with the community function enabled will be able to help locate the lost tag if it comes within range of any MYNT user. Once the MYNT app detects a lost item, the whereabouts will be sent to your phone instantly.Why We Need Your SupportMYNT is ready for production. We can't stand for anything that's not perfect – we designed MYNT to be just 1/8 inch thick, something deemed impossible without sacrificing performance like battery life and alarm volume. We are doing an Indiegogo campaign because we believe that you are our best possible early adopters. We'll ship MYNT as soon as the campaign ends.With your help, we will be able to add more smart functions. We will make connection with Xbox, smart refrigerators, cars, and you name it smart device possible. We need your help so we can constantly improve the functionality of MYNT and release updated versions, which can be easily upgraded over the air. MYNT will evolve into a smart swiss army button that fits your needs in unimaginable ways. With you help, together, we can make MYNT even better.

Testimonial video:  This is cool, I actually just got my Tile last week, and (comparing with MYNT) it feels kind of fat. I like that I can actually use it for presentations, I like that I can use it for taking photos. It’s pretty handy, especially the size.

Professor Eli Yablonovitch  (Berkeley Professor, Member of the National Academy of Engineering, the National Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Arts & Sciences)
I am really amazed with the achievements of the Slightech Engineering team. When they told me they were going to create MYNT with a stainless steel body, I said ""don’t do that, use plastic, because solving antenna problems with a metal body is a very challenging and difficult task"". Ultimately, when I got the working sample, I was shocked! It's really well crafted -- looks great -- and the antenna works perfectly.User Testimonial

HTC One M7
Xiaomi Note
Xiaomi Redmi
Xiaomi Redmi 2
Smartisan T1
Meizu Blue
Huawei 3C
Huawei Mate 7
No-name tablet with MTK CPU
OnePlus One
Android phones with issues: Samsung Note 3 N9002 (doesn't support firmware upgrade. If you decide to stay with the stock version of the firmware, it's okay)
Do I have to download a Mac OS X app for the presentation remote?
Yes, you need to download the app from our website. Here's the download link: 
http://slightech.sinaapp.com/downloads/mynt-v1.0.dmg

How many MYNTs can be handeled through the App? We support up to 8 MYNTs in our app.How far back to you support ios? Will it work with an iPhone 4 (not the 4s)?It has to be iPhone 4s or later, since iPhone 4 doesn't support Bluetooth 4.0.How do you manage “geo-fencing” to have a good mix between “do not forget your keys when you leave the house” AND “it does not ring when you go to the next room”?We have a feature, called ""safe zone"". You can set your home or office as safe zone, so you will get a warning when you forget your key when you leave house, but won't ring when you go to the other room.Will this work without GPS enabled on your phone? I assume the close proximity alerts will still function if Bluetooth is on, but I'm unsure how regular GPS factors in. Would having Bluetooth on and no GPS mean that groupGps is useless?If you turn the GPS off, all of the functions are still working, just it won't record the location of your item on map. What are the limited connections required for his app to function?Just Bluetooth. Could you explain the GroupGPS more clearly for me? Is the Regular GPS in a phone only used for this part? Do other users that use GroupGPS know where your lost item is if you decide to announce something as lost? Is there the potential that someone could use GroupGPS and steal lost items?They won't know. Their phone will detect the missing MYNT when it's close by, then such info will be sent to our server, and we will pass it to you. Is there a way to allow certain users (one's you deem as friends potentially) to help get alerts about your specific missing item?Yes, we are working on this feature - to allow all people or certain people to get alerts.Can you tell me the range of the MYNT GPS or Bluetooth range? It showed that you can track you back to your parked car but wanted to know how far you can be.The MYNT Bluetooth range is about 150 feet in open space, but when it's blocked by metal, it's short. It uses GPS on your smart phone to record the last lost signal location. So, when you have MYNT in your car, once you leave your car, the MYNT app in your smartphone will record your car parking location. Later on you can check it on the map of MYNT app to find your car.What is the “Out of range” distance (left keys on restaurant table) before the “out of range alarm” goes off on my iPhone? Also, how will this lead me back to the lost item which is attached to MYNT? (GPS function )""Out of range"" mean the Bluetooth loses signal. This can be 30 feet to 150 feet depending the obstacles between MYNT and your smartphone. One you get an alarm, you can first look at the lost location from the map in the MYNT app. Once you get closer to your lost item location, MYNT will automatically connect to your smartphone again. Then you can get even closer to your lost item by looking at the signal of the Bluetooth in the MYNT app. You can also let MYT buzz and flash from that MYNT app, that will help you eventually find your lost item.Please let us know if you have any questions, comments/suggestions or ideas!

All you will need to do is “edit your pledge.” This option will allow you to select the pledge you prefer. Remember that you will choose your watches at the end of the campaign when a survey will be sent.When will my card be charged? If you’re new to Kickstarter this might be confusing to you but here on KS all cards will be charged as soon as the campaign has been officially funded and the time has ran out on the campaign. You should see a charge on your account 3-5 days after the campaign endsHow long will my watch be warranted? We will work with all customers case by case but all watch movements will be insured for up to a year after the campaign ends. We cannot warrant customers who break their watches due to wear and tear.Do all backers benefit from Stretch Goals? Absolutely. It doesn't matter if you were the first or the last to back our project, all backers qualify for the stretch goals.When can I select the watch of choice? We will be sending out our official survey once our project ends. You will then be able to select your watch and give us your correct shipping instructions.Who do you use for shipping international orders? We use DHL Express for all international and domestic shipments (excluding PO Box addresses).What parts of the watch are actually luminescent? The indexes and hour and minute hands.",57.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<h2><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><br/>OUR PHILOSOPHY</span></h2>
<p>Berserkers
were brave Norse warriors. Allegedly, they were highly skilled, strong, gifted
men who fearlessly went into battle with no armor other than animal skins.
Hence their name. The word “Berserker” literally translates into “bear-shirt”.
They were enthusiastic, over-confident fighters prone to heroic sacrifices.
And, more importantly, they never, ever retreated.</p>
<p><b>We are the modern Berserkers</b>, proud
descendants of our fierce forefathers. We want to revive the legend and awake
your inner warrior. </p>
<p>We live life
to the fullest. We know what we want and are not afraid to go after it. <br/><b>We’re healthy. We work out.</b> We take
pride in how we look and the way we live our lives.</p>
<p><b>We love life.</b> We know
how to enjoy life. We don’t dwell on the past, nor worry about the future. <b>We
live now. </b></p>
<p>We’re in
fashion. We’re sophisticated, yet a little <b>rough</b>
around the edges.<br/>
When we go out the door, we always do it in style.</p>
<p>We are not
crazy. <b>We’re dead serious.</b> <br/>
We are who you want to be.</p>

INTRO


Hi there! We’re Tiemen and Joey and we are Berserkers.

Be-WHAT? Berserkers! 
We have developed a clothing and lifestyle brand inspired by the Nordic
mythology of ancient warriors. With a modern twist of course.








It all started with a trip Tiemen took to Iceland. When hiking over there he got inspired by the tales of the elite Nordic warriors called “Berserkers”. They would run into battle wearing nothing but warpaint and bear skins.


Hearing their heroic stories made him create a unique
fitness/health guide. A guide that will help people maximize their inner
strength. The guide consists of a series of training schedules based solely on
a person’s body weight. With exercises that can be done at home, or anywhere you
want, at any given time. You don’t need expensive equipment or year long
gym memberships. Neat, huh?






Now. What to wear when working out? Or after
the work out, when preparing for a party? Not bearskins obviously. Hell no! How
about an exclusive Berserkers t-shirt?
Hell yes! Our tees can be worn both for working out and going out. They will make you look and feel your very best.OUR COLLECTION

I'VE NEVER HEARD OF INDIEGOGO. WHAT IS IT?
Indiegogo is a platform for companies to
offer rewards in return for pledges (investments) into new/existing products.
It works really well when companies such as ourselves are launching a clothing
collection.

WHY IS BERSERKERS USING INDIEGOGO?


We are using Indiegogo to fund the release
of our first ever t-shirt collection and be able to produce it in Belgium. We
are looking for your support and investment in return for this collection at a lower price than the recommended retail price in euros.


RISKS AND CHALLENGES

EXPERIENCE
We’ve got years of experience in the fitness
world and are therefore very confident when it comes to our fitness guide. 
We’ve also designed t-shirts before, but this is our most ambitious and largest
clothing project yet. We are convinced, however, that our endless passion and creativity will take us right where we want to be.MASSIVE DEMAND
There is a chance that we have much more
demand than we expected. This is good, because it'll help drive down costs and
allow us to offer the stock at lower cost, but many Indiegogo campaigns in the past have struggled to keep up with responses. We have a
commitment to reply to our supporters within 24 hours. Accordingly, the team
has committed to investing all the time necessary to make this happen.
PAYMENT OPTIONS


No Paypal? No problem! You can click the Paypal option and
pay using your credit card (VISA/MasterCard), without having a Paypal account.If you're still having trouble paying, then contact us at hello@berserkers.be.I'm sure we'll be able to work something out.",7.0,1,"1 Campaign

According to the World Health Organization, a child in the third world goes blind in both eyes every minute. 60% of these children go on to lose their lives within a year of losing their sight. Currently, children from low-income families in Sub-Saharan Africa experience the highest prevalence of childhood blindness in the world.<br/><p></p>

<p>Monday, Dec 21st 2015  marked the beginning of making good on their promise, as IGo collaborated with TINY &amp; GREAT Creche &amp; Nursery and the African Center for Innovation and Leadership Development (ACILD) in a united effort to support children’s vision in Ogbomoso, Nigeria. The event was hosted to: conduct eye test for the students of the school, and to provide medications and prescription glasses to students determined to be in need of them. Over forty students were carefully examined and tested by the ophthalmologist, Dr. Adepoju. While over 90% of the children tested checked out as having good vision, Dr. Adepoju highlighted the importance of such routine eye examination, especially for children, who may not be able to adequately express their need for vision correction. She remarked that compared to adults, the lifelong impact of visual impairment on children is prodigious due to longer period or years of disability, which come with emotional, social, and economic costs to the child, the family, and society as a whole. She admonished IGo to not limit their efforts and support to just prescription glasses as children of this age-group would benefit from supplements such as vitamin A, which could help prevent vision impairment.<br/></p>

</div></div>","IGo™ Eyewear
Always. eVolVe.
IGo is a premium eyewear company on a mission. Our mission is to create a fashionable brand of eco-friendly sunglasses while improving the quality of life for underpriviliged children in developing countries. So far, we have provided free eye care to over 40 children in Nigeria. But as we grow, we plan to expand our mission to all corners of the world where there is need.

Childhood visual impairment and blindness continue to be an enormous burden in developing nations. According to the World Health Organization, a child in the third world goes blind in both eyes every minute. 60% of these children go on to lose their lives within a year of losing their sight. Currently, children from low-income families in Sub-Saharan Africa experience the highest prevalence of childhood blindness in the world.

As the brainchild of Adey, a Nigerian-born engineer turned entrepreneur, IGo was founded as a new line of premium and fashionable eyewear. And with the help of his cousin Taiwo, a Yale-educated scientist and educator, these two entrepreneurs are seeking to redefine ""cool"" while creating a socially and environmentally responsible product with the potential for a truly global impact.

IGo is set apart in the eyewear market by its attention to environmental sustainability. All of our glasses are made from the most renewable and sturdy woods and the plastics we use are 100% recycled, meaning they can avoid piling up in a landfill or polluting our oceans. 







Through partnerships with organizations such as A Ray of Hope UNESCO, and the African Center for Innovation and Leadership Development (ACILD), our ""buy one, give one"" approach to business ensures that a purchase of IGo Eyewear helps a child in the developing world get the eye care and/or prescription glasses that he or she needs. We are committed to providing funding to support our partners on the the ground as they address the needs of children around the world.

  




Vision & Education Initiative Maiden Edition - December 2015

Monday, Dec 21st 2015  marked the beginning of making good on their promise, as IGo collaborated with TINY & GREAT Creche & Nursery and the African Center for Innovation and Leadership Development (ACILD) in a united effort to support children’s vision in Ogbomoso, Nigeria. The event was hosted to: conduct eye test for the students of the school, and to provide medications and prescription glasses to students determined to be in need of them. Over forty students were carefully examined and tested by the ophthalmologist, Dr. Adepoju. While over 90% of the children tested checked out as having good vision, Dr. Adepoju highlighted the importance of such routine eye examination, especially for children, who may not be able to adequately express their need for vision correction. She remarked that compared to adults, the lifelong impact of visual impairment on children is prodigious due to longer period or years of disability, which come with emotional, social, and economic costs to the child, the family, and society as a whole. She admonished IGo to not limit their efforts and support to just prescription glasses as children of this age-group would benefit from supplements such as vitamin A, which could help prevent vision impairment.

<p>At Dolica, we are constantly looking for new ideas that will make life a little better. Even though we live in sunny southern california we like a little snow up in Big Bear and Mammoth. And us Angelenos are prone to freezing if temperatures go below 70 degrees. So in the mountains we need a little help to keep our hands warm. A regular snow glove works but somethings its not enough. That when necessity is the mother of invention. We came up with a lithium ion powered heated gloves.</p>

Prototype and Technology behind the Glove






The On Demand Heated Gloves are made with a special heat conductive carbon fiber film that lines the palms and fingers. 



 The concept came from heat seats in cars. Heated seats also need a flexible heat material that can flex and move with the seat. We basically took from that concept and applied it to gloves. The result is a flexible material with the conductive film lined throughout the palm and fingers. 







 The secret sauce of our product is this flexible heat conductive carbon fiber. Once you add the connector cable and Lithium Ion battery you have a On Demand Heated Glove that will heat your hands in seconds once its activated.

<h1>The Numbers!</h1>
<p>To be worthwhile, I have to print a minimum of two dozen of each design. So each design printed costs me $308.49 whether I sell 1 or all 24. To print all 12 designs means I have to pay almost $3700 up front, just to find out if this is a good idea. So can I just say HOORAY for crowdfunding? </p>
<p>Using my minimum goal numbers, the production cost will be roughly $12.85 per shirt. Indiegogo takes 4%, plus 3% for a transaction fee. A good envelope for .75 cents and you have $5.00 for YACC for each $20 pledge! Yay MATH! </p>

After spending many years working in the Eyewear Industry I have been able to gain experience in all facets of the sunglass world from product development, merchandising, sales and brand management. I always refused to spend the $400, $500 or more on brand name sunglasses while knowing I could offer something just as great, if not better at a much more affordable price! So I introduce Jembere Eyewear to you! </p><p>Jembere Eyewear is a fashionable, high quality, handmade sunglass collection with a unique cultural aesthetic. I wanted to incorporate the rich culture of Ethiopia while creating this collection. Growing up around such beautiful clothing and jewelry, I knew there was a way to blend these into the brand. As you have seen in the video, taking something that is usually a basic addition to your sunglass purchase like a cleaning cloth and adding such an artisan touch to it. These hand woven pieces are gorgeously handmade by true artisans of Ethiopia. </p><p></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The sunglasses are made using some of the best materials from Italy, Germany and Hong Kong. All of the glasses are handmade using acetate, 5 panel hinges for durability and CR39 lenses. Each glass will come with a snap case, hand woven cleaning cloth and inside the Jembere Eyewear box. My First collection consists of three styles. Two unisex and one ladies style.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><br/></span></p><p></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0.06em; line-height: 30px;"">THE COLLECTION</span></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/230944/files/20131129054947-photo_3.JPG?1385732987"" src="""" style=""line-height: 1.45em; width: 273.59882005899703px; height: 371px;""/></p><p>This frame looks great on all faces!

<p></p></div>","Handmade, fashionable, high quality Men's and Ladies sunglasses with a unique cultural aesthetic!
WHY JEMBERE EYEWEAR?The sunglass market is overflowing with outrageously priced sunglasses, so Jembere Eyewear was created to offer an amazing product at a reasonable price. After spending many years working in the Eyewear Industry I have been able to gain experience in all facets of the sunglass world from product development, merchandising, sales and brand management. I always refused to spend the $400, $500 or more on brand name sunglasses while knowing I could offer something just as great, if not better at a much more affordable price! So I introduce Jembere Eyewear to you! Jembere Eyewear is a fashionable, high quality, handmade sunglass collection with a unique cultural aesthetic. I wanted to incorporate the rich culture of Ethiopia while creating this collection. Growing up around such beautiful clothing and jewelry, I knew there was a way to blend these into the brand. As you have seen in the video, taking something that is usually a basic addition to your sunglass purchase like a cleaning cloth and adding such an artisan touch to it. These hand woven pieces are gorgeously handmade by true artisans of Ethiopia. The sunglasses are made using some of the best materials from Italy, Germany and Hong Kong. All of the glasses are handmade using acetate, 5 panel hinges for durability and CR39 lenses. Each glass will come with a snap case, hand woven cleaning cloth and inside the Jembere Eyewear box. My First collection consists of three styles. Two unisex and one ladies style.THE COLLECTIONThis frame looks great on all faces! Just take a look at the images below! Adorned with a gold Meskel, an ancient Ethiopian Cross, you are sure to love this glass!Available Colors: Black w/Gold Meskel OR Brown Tortoise w/Gold Meskel This beautiful cateye is a TWO in ONE glass ladies! Two chains hang on both sides, but can easily be removed and worn as simply a beautiful cateye. Available Colors: Black w/Gold Chains OR Brown Tortoise w/Gold ChainsThis classic aviator shape is for everyone! Adding a fashionable twist with the acetate top bar and unique logo placement on the inner frame. Available Colors: Black on Black OR Gold w/Black and Gold mirror lens                                                                       Why Jembere Eyewear Needs YOU! I have been able to get through the development stage and have my pre production samples.

I graduated from Dartmouth College with a Major in Engineering and Studio Art, and a minor in Computer Science. At Dartmouth I played on the Men's Golf team and the Men's Club Hockey Team.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>My Vision</h3>
<p>Fueled by my love for sports, my experience in technology and product management, and my desire to build useful services, I started ZeluStream.  Today, sports fans can only watch games at the whims and mercy of their cable provider. Other fans can unplug using online, on-demand services like Hulu and Netflix. Sports fans attach themselves to their cable box and their sports package. ZeluStream aims to provide a viable alternative to traditional cable subscriptions and packaged sports content, while also allowing fans to watch wherever they can connect to the internet.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>How Do We Get There?</h3>
<div>ZeluStream can't attack the big US markets without first proving that the business model and the economics work for smaller audiences. This means targeting a sport with a smaller following in the US. Initially, ZeluStream will focus on Rugby, Cycling, and Cricket. ZeluStream will work with College, Professional and International organizations to record and live stream their games and races. We will market to fans of each sport, giving them a single place to view their favorite events.</div>
<p><br/></p>
<p>With your help, ZeluStream will hit the ground running. We'll build our website, and begin collecting signups from fans who want to help test our service. We'll begin discussions with organizations and existing content providers to find the best possible solution for you, the fans. Finally, we'll build the service itself, so fans can watch all their favorite events using ZeluStream.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need</h3> <p>To launch, ZeluStream needs your help to raise $1000. With your generous contributions, we plan to:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Build ZeluStream website and launch our brand</b>: Buy domain name, build website, buy hosting, Design ZeluStream logo, and launch Facebook and Twitter accounts.</li>
<li>
<b>Incorporate ZeluStream</b>: File associated paperwork.</li>
<li>
<b>Discuss Partnerships</b>: Travel costs.</li>
<li>
<b>Build ZeluStream</b>: Buy app hosting, development costs.</li>
</ul>
<div>
<ul>
</ul>
<div>Don't worry, if ZeluStream doesn't reach its goal, your contribution won't go to waste. We still plan to build our website and our brand, and we'll continue to solicit feedback and ideas from our audience.</div>
</div>
</div><div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<div>ZeluStream's largest risks and challenges arise from the nature of the sports entertainment industry as structured today:</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<ul>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Networks sign large, exclusive, multi-year deals with sports leagues and special events.</span></li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Potential partners may not see the benefits of our model.</span></li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Networks and cable providers build out similar services.</span><br/>
</li>
</ul>
<div><br/></div>
</div>
<div>ZeluStream will challenge this status quo by going after smaller, non-exclusive deals, as well as reseller deals from the networks themselves. We'll start by targeting a niche audience in the US, such as soccer fans, rugby fans, or cricket fans. This will allow ZeluStream to build an audience, and prove to other sports leagues and networks that this model can work.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>My passion for sports and sports fans, combined with my experience building products for technology companies, puts me in a unique position to address these risks. I still have a lot of learning to do about the ins and outs of the sports entertainment business, but I know from my Product Management skills that I can work with league and network executives to identify the win-win situations. To address the risk of competition from other services, ZeluStream will stay small in order to better listen to its fans and respond more quickly than large networks can.</div>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>I was shopping for clothes for my husband and wondered why men's clothing sizes are based off of their body measurements, yet women, who are much shapelier than men, are stuck to sizes that don’t correlate to anyone’s measurements. All the way from a size 0 to a 22 there are really only 11 or 12 different sizes for us to choose from! So our clothes either don’t fit, or we wear baggy clothes, or buy super stretchy clothes so that it doesn’t matter what our measurements are, and even then they don’t always fit us right. And it can destroy a woman's confidence. Trying on outfit after outfit without anything fitting makes us feel like there's something wrong with our bodies! But what's wrong is the out of date sizing system we're forced to shop from. We see something online or at the store that we love but then we try it on and hate it. It's not because we suddenly hate the dress. It's because the dress doesn't fit like it's supposed to!</li>
<li>Instead of making you look at a chart to decide which size is closest to your measurements, we sew every piece to our customers' exact measurements so they actually fit. This includes widths and heights so that every part of the dress will fit how it is supposed to. We don't have to have ""plus-size"" or ""petite"" or ""curvy"" or ""average"" - we just have your real measurements. So everyone gets to order any of our designs that they want. </li>
<li>All of the background work of this company has already been done. We have spent the past year creating patterns, trying them on friends and family, and perfecting the patterns so that everyone's individual measurements come out perfectly in these custom clothes. This fundraiser will serve as pre-orders to allow us to purchase the necessary equipment to manufacture the clothes with the highest quality and on a larger scale. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>To make some necessary upgrades to our equipment, we need to raise $8,500. We currently use home sewing machines which can't handle the amount of sewing we put them through, not to mention the cost of upkeep on a home machine gets very expensive when they get used commercially because the machines aren't made to keep up with that much wear and tear. This upgrade will also increase the quality of our garments.</li>
<li>Donations will be rewarded with gift cards in the amounts of the donation, so that the funds work more as pre-purchases instead of just donations. The gift cards will be electronically sent to the e-mail used to make the donation. Cards will not be sent until the goal is met and the campaign has ended. Dresses will average between $100-200. </li>
<li>We expect to be up and running 2-3 months after the last day of the campaign. At this time, everyone will receive an e-mail update to let them know they can use their gift cards!</li>
</ul>
</div><div><h3> </h3></div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Obviously with custom clothing measurements are very important. As an online company we are providing resources in the forms of instructional videos and kits to help our customers send in correct measurements.</p>
<p>Even with these precautions we do realize there will still be circumstances that someone's measurements are not quite right, and for this reason we allow for one free minor alteration (i.e. taking something in, shortening sleeves or hems, etc)</p>

<p>At the Roav design lab, we love solving challenging eyewear problems. On May 15th, we came across a good one. Eye protection is more important than ever, but the current options are bulky, uncomfortable, and far from aesthetically pleasing. We wondered if we could create a goggle, with style. Time was of the essence, and in a furious blaze of nonstop design, stoggles were born. We’ve poured every ounce of our experience and passion into this product, and we’re so excited to share it with the world.</p>

<h2>You've found the perfect iPhone purse.</h2>
<p>You've been there. You've got your cutest outfit on and you're ready to go out for the evening. Just grab your ID and iPhone and put it...where?<img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://dl.dropbox.com/s/cxmlh9kvd9dsofp/vertical.png"" src="""" style=""float: left; margin-right: 2em;""/>A simple, elegant bag</h3>
<p>The bag is beautifully designed with soft leather front &amp; back. The sides are beaded and hand-crocheted. Inside is a fabric lining and small side pocket to hold one or two cards. Your iPhone fits easily but snugly and is well protected by the soft leather wrapped around it and a double layer of leather along the bottom edge to protect it when you set the bag down.</p>
<p>To match the light weight minimal elegance of the bag, the strap is just a simple matching ribbon. Perfect because it won't take away from your outfit and its simlicity matches with almost anything.</p>
<h3>A wrap up bracelet to match</h3>
<p>The matching bracelet is made with the same technique as the sides of the bag and braided cotton to tie. It's beaded and hand-crocheted into subtle but striking patterns. Beautiful!</p>
<h3>Eco friendly</h3>
<p>Designers working with leather produce a lot of scraps of beautiful soft leather. Because this bag is small, I'm able to use some of those scraps and prevent them from going to waste.</p>

<h3>The Back Story</h3>
<p>This spring I was frustrated with constantly digging through my big purse for my phone. I needed something small and pretty but functional that could also keep my hands free in between texts. After a bit of experimenting, I came up with this simple design and I love it! A few weeks later when a friend's sister gave me cash on the spot to make her one, I realized that maybe I wasn't the only one who needed this. After a bit of looking around I was amazed to see that there is nothing like this on the market. So here we are!</p>

You've been there. You've got your cutest outfit on and you're ready to go out for the evening. Just grab your ID and iPhone and put it...where?

 

A simple, elegant bag
The bag is beautifully designed with soft leather front & back. The sides are beaded and hand-crocheted. Inside is a fabric lining and small side pocket to hold one or two cards. Your iPhone fits easily but snugly and is well protected by the soft leather wrapped around it and a double layer of leather along the bottom edge to protect it when you set the bag down.
To match the light weight minimal elegance of the bag, the strap is just a simple matching ribbon. Perfect because it won't take away from your outfit and its simlicity matches with almost anything.
A wrap up bracelet to match
The matching bracelet is made with the same technique as the sides of the bag and braided cotton to tie. It's beaded and hand-crocheted into subtle but striking patterns. Beautiful!
Eco friendly
Designers working with leather produce a lot of scraps of beautiful soft leather. Because this bag is small, I'm able to use some of those scraps and prevent them from going to waste.
About Eliza
Eliza has been designing jewelry in Toronto for several years and is becoming a well known local designer. She's appeared in a variety of Canadian and International magazines. Check out her website!


The Back Story
This spring I was frustrated with constantly digging through my big purse for my phone. I needed something small and pretty but functional that could also keep my hands free in between texts. After a bit of experimenting, I came up with this simple design and I love it! A few weeks later when a friend's sister gave me cash on the spot to make her one, I realized that maybe I wasn't the only one who needed this. After a bit of looking around I was amazed to see that there is nothing like this on the market. So here we are!
Details
Height: 4.5"" (11.5 cm)
Width: 3"" (7.5 cm)
Thickness: 0.4"" (1 cm)
Strap 50.5"" (128 cm)
Genuine leather
Crocheted with soft organic cotton
Glass, crystal and hematite beads
Fits all iPhones and standard sized Android or Windows phones as well as most recent Blackberries.
Will fit even if the phone is in a small case.
Card pocket fits 2 standard sized cards.
The strap can be tied off for a more snug fit.
Shipping
All prices include shipping to anywhere. The delivery dates are estimates and I hope to ship substantially earlier. I'll be shipping a couple of times a week as they are produced!


Other Ways You Can Help
Twitter, Tumblr, Facebook, blogs, YouTube, magazine articles, TV spots! If you you like my work, please help me get the word out. I'd love to make this just the first of many neat projects so I'm really hoping that this will be a big success. If you're interested in talking to me about this project, please do get in touch.

<p>We are a couple of videogame-ware developers, with numerous hardware and software innovations under our belts.  We came up with the PeanutBuddy out of sheer frustration with the mess that regular packing peanuts caused in our warehouse and on the environment.</p>
<h2><strong>What Is The PeanutBuddy?</strong></h2>
<p>The PeanutBuddy is a <strong>Patent Pending</strong> Peanut Bag Dispenser System that transforms the standard 7 to 30 Cubic Ft. plastic peanuts' packaging bag, into an overhead peanut dispenser in less than 60 seconds!</p>
<h2><strong>Why Choose The PeanutBuddy?</strong></h2>
<p>Current peanut dispensers are too large for small to mid-sized shippers, and are not practical. Furthermore, they have an average cost of over $200, which is not ideal in today's economy.  The PeanutBuddy is easier to use, has a much lower cost of entry, and simply <em>works better!</em></p>

<h2><strong>Where We Are Today</strong></h2>
<p>We’ve been working on the PeanutBuddy for many months now, and we have filed <strong>multiple patents to cover every aspect of the entire system</strong>. The PeanutBuddy that you see in the video is a real, working prototype.</p>

<p>We're protecting the environment, one peanut at a time! We care about the planet, and know the harm that traditional polystyrene shipping peanuts can cause. That's why we created <strong>Bud-Nutz! </strong><strong>Bud-Nutz</strong> biodegradable packing peanuts eliminate the negative environmental impact of polystyrene peanuts.  Made with organic starch, they decompose in water and leave no toxic waste!</p>

<h2><strong>STRETCH GOAL</strong></h2>
<h3>
<strong>$25K - SCISSOR RELEASE VALVE </strong><strong>UPGRADE</strong>
</h3>
<p>The PeanutBuddy design using the scissor-release valve is an improvement over the first, single-flap release valve design. Because of the additional costs required to convert the current tooling, the upgrade has been slated for a later release date. By achieving our stretch goal of $25K, we will be able to implement the improvements early, and upgrade the first production run to the new, improved design. </p>
<h2><strong>Your Role</strong></h2>
<p>You play a very important role in helping us bring the PeanutBuddy to market, and literally helping millions of small shippers, just like us, solve a major problem.</p>
<p>We are seeking  $10,00 in Pre-orders for the first production run.  In return for your support, you will receive one of the many rewards, that we have thoughtfully prepared and listed.</p>
<h2><strong>Rewards</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Peanut Buddy Starter Kit:</strong> Each kit <span>includes 1 PeanutBuddy Chute, 10 adhesive suspension straps, 10 reinforcement (donut) collars, and 1 wall/ceiling hook, and 1 Buddy-Face Sticker. <em><strong> </strong></em></span><em><strong>(Additional donut collars and suspension straps are available from the PeanutBuddy website.) </strong></em>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>*Special Reward Level - Beta Testers:</strong>  Be the first to own and use the PeanutBuddy, and help us beta test the system.  As a beta tester, you will work closely with us and participate directly in our strategic communications, providing feedback and recommendations on the current PeanutBuddy as well future improvements. We'll give you a Free bag of the eco-friendly Bud-Nutz as a token of our appreciaton.</p>
</li>
</ul><h2><strong>A Huge Thank You</strong></h2>

<p>We sincerely appreciate your support, and look forward to the day when every shipper, large and small, is lucky enough (because of you) to hang a PeanutBuddy and bag of Bud-Nutz in their offices, garages, or warehouses.  Let the Peanut Revolution begin!</p>

 If I don't reach our goal, I intend to use the raised funds towards designing a smaller line and updating the website.    





You make a HUGE difference.  


1.  You
receive the PERK of Laura Elizabeth Jewelry for as little as $25. See details
of all the PERKS  above.
2.  You will
help me fulfill the dream of taking Laura Elizabeth to the next level.
 This includes designing 7-10 new eco-friendly pieces, getting a sales
rep, revamping the website, and participating in a trade show.
3.  Making a
donation to Girl Rising, a
global campaign focused on empowering girls through education in developing
countries.
Laura Elizabeth is a developed brand and company.  We've last over 9 years.  Your support is going towards a company that is only growing!






   

I gotta be honest, there are always risks and obstacles one faces on her way to achieving her goal.  I am sure you are asking yourself, ""What if Laura Elizabeth doesn't reach her goal, will I still get my PERK?""  ABSOLUTELY!     I have chosen a ""flexible funding"" campaign.  Therefore, if I raise only a fraction of our goal, I still receive the funds.  Therefore, I can easily make and ship your PERK off to you by no later than December 1st, 2015.  Just in time for the holidays! I have high quality, reliable, sustainable manufacturers whom we have worked with for over 6 years.  I guarantee you, you and your PERK are in good hands. :) 








How else can you contribute to this campaign other than financial donations?:  Please, get the word out and make some noise about this campaign.  Social media is a perfect way to spread the word.  Share links via Facebook, Twitter or Instagram.  Use Indiegogo's share tools! http://igg.me/at/LauraElizabeth",23.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Life can get very hectic and finding time to connect with your child during the day is sometimes impossible. Either you are stuck in meetings or they are running from school to their extracurricular activities and you never seem to find the time to check in with them throughout the day. With the TickTalk you are able to send a quick hello text from the App, find a moment to give them a call so they can hear your voice, and even listen in to what is going on around your child with the Super Hearing function.</p>
<p>A parents greatest fear is losing their child while out at the mall, airport, parks or even down the street. A child can go missing in a blink of an eye. One minute they are right by your side and the next they may have wandered off.

It takes a lot more capital than I have to expand my business and expand our operations.Banks are not lending to small businesses right now. So crowd-funding and friends is the only place I can go to raise funds to grow my business. 


WOMEN WHO NEED JOBS
Expanding my business means I will be able to hire more people and help them have a better life. Employing women whom can't find work could change their lives, and reduce the unemployment rate.With $22,000, I can finally fill the orders we currently have. I could even go national and have my Donna Bella Designs handbags in hundreds of stores across the U.S., something I’ve dreamed of since I started my business years ago.

<p></p><p></p></div>","Hi there.Thanks for checking out Mirrogram. I'm Andrew. Former high school teacher, married in Yellow Croc's and now somehow find myself starting a fashion line!It is my hope that this clothing reflects a creative advocate for social justice, a passionate educator and someone who isn't afraid of doing things differently. Oh, and speaking of reflects, each design reflects in the mirror to say something different! Giving up a stable wage and students I love teaching to start a social enterprise has been a hard slog. But my dream remains to ""Change Fashion. For Good"".This is where you come in!What is a Mirrogram?A Mirrogram is a design that changes in the mirror to say something different, make a statement and create conversation.Are you clever enough to work out the ones below? Shoot us a comment with your answers.Generosi-teeThese clothes don't just change in the mirror. They change lives.Generosi-tee is the only response you can have after many trips to India and Nepal. This is not a token gesture. I am not even waiting until we've made a profit. There are people in desperate need and your choice to support Mirrogram will help at least some of them out. The best thing is you get to choose the project you are most passionate about (midday meal, school supplies, opportunity and talks/workshops). Your selection empowers locals to work in their own communities, which I am convinced is the most effective way of aiding development.What you get? (AKA: The Perks)
To create conversation.
To challenge assumptions and cause others to ""Stop and Reflect"".
To become a billboard for something that matters to you.
A great excuse if you get caught checking yourself out in the mirror.
Unique hand-made designs that say something different when reflected.
To help change the lives of some of the world's poorest people.
A great way to play a prank on one of your friends.
These completely unique designs are available on Premium quality Caps and Shirts, deliciously warm hoodies and the never seen before ""Neck-Brace-Ring"". We give you all you need to make a Necklace, Bracelet and Keyring and you get to choose what to make...speaking of choose, with every single one of these perks you get the choice of which development project to put $3 toward.
How else can I get involved?
Aside from taking advantage of the wonderful perks on offer you can help change fashion for good by sharing this on social media (it's as easy as clicking a button).As I said in the film, running a social enterprise solo is tough work. I've become a writer, photographer, web designer, marketer, salesman, delivery driver, heck, I've even learnt to tie bracelets! We are currently looking for collaborators so if ""changing fashion for good"" is something you'd like to be a part of feel free to get in touch. Send an email to andrew@ontheflipside.org Frequently Asked QuestionsHow do I choose my size, colour and design? At the end of the campaign we will email you a form where you can choose your size, colour and design.Will they shrink? No, all garments are pre-shrunk except the Australian made Organic shirts which will shrink around 1/2cm (1/5 in)What will be done with the funds raised? Once we reach our goal we'll create your products and get them out to you as soon as possible. You'll also be sent a link where you can select which development project to send your $3 to. Once we have taken care of that, any additional funds will be used for continued production and expansion of our line. My hope is to be competitive enough to get into a retail chain or if things go really well, start a bricks and mortar store. Then we can really start changing fashion for good.When do I get my stuff? Allowing 20 days to receive the funds we raised we can expect to have your order delivered to you within 3 months of the end of the campaign. Most orders will come a lot sooner than that.What sizes do they come in? From Kids sizes to 5XL. I'm pretty sure we've got you covered.What if I'm not satisfied? If for any reason you're not satisfied with your perk send an email to andrew@ontheflipside.org and we'll arrange for an exchange or full return. If you've worn any clothing our only request is that you wash it before sending it back. We don't want any smelly bacteria breeding on the way back to Australia. We have strict customs laws you know!! What if someone steals my clothes? It's more a matter of when. Significant others, friends, even your kids will volunteer to do the washing for the chance at snatching your Mirrogram clothing.

After few years of learning the business and taking fashion classes, I produced 2 lines, having success with both lines. I have learned so much over the years and  I continue to grow as a designer. Now in my 3rd collection I am looking forward to seeing your reaction to my latest ideals.</p>
<p>I started this journey in Jackson, MS, where I was born and raised. Growing up in the south set the tone for being a well groomed man. I come from a big family and the man that I am today wouldn't be possible without them. Having  uncles, who raised me into being a well groomed young man and grandfather who raised them the same.  My name <b>D'Ira</b> is derived from both of my grandfathers <b>Ira</b> my dad's father and <b>David</b> my mom's father(grandfather <b>Ira,</b> sitting). The morals I developed growing up were to always respect your elders and family is everything. I carry those same morals in my every day life and day to day business.</p>

<b>Sizes: S-XXL</b><h3>Lets change the game</h3>
</div>
</div><div> <p>This project is very valuable, not only to me, but the world as a whole. Growing up in the south like I mentioned before, we had a lot of tradition and today when I visit home it seems to be a lot of that missing. Young men don't seem to care about how they look, how low their pants sag, or just keeping themselves looking presentable. The long hair and low pants seem to be the trend now, and that's exactly what I am here to change. Society will have you believing that young men don't dress up anymore and that most young men are thugs with their pants low. </p>
<p>When a young man goes shopping these days he has very little to choose from, because most retail malls carry 75% women retail stores. Men are left out in the cold, sort of speaking, to fend for themselves in this fashion world. What happens when a young man gets his first job out of college, he need new clothes to go work in, t-shirts and flip flops are not suitable in Corporate America or when a young man needs to dress up for a school presentation, a dinner date or just a night out on the town, can't wear Air Jordans with everything. </p>
<p>Young men every where ask themselves these questions everyday with no designer in mind. Young men are flooded with the latest sneakers, expensive jeans, and t-shirts , but still don't know how to wear a tie. So many times I hear women tell me <b>""Oh, I wish my son would dress like that"" or "" Oh, I like your sense of style""</b>. This is why retail malls are 75% catered to women, men don't seem to have a clue when it come to style. Its not that men don't like to look good as well, the problem is that they truly believe they are looking good. Clothes to big, shoe colors that don't match anything, and the list goes on. Young men are the number one target market to these types of stereotypes in the clothing industry, and with your help you can help me market a new brand with a timeless look.</p>
<p>I have already had success in the market with two previous lines, I designed back in 2008 and 2009.</p>

So many people all over never got a chance to see these lines and add a piece to their closet. A successfully funded campaign will allow us to that, We will  be able to produce enough inventory and market it on our website to people all over the world.</div> <div> <h3>Process ( How does all this work)</h3>
<div>I am glad that you have read this far and still interested in my clothing line, but I guess you would like to know the ends and out of the business and how everything works. Well, I have made the process very easy and simple just as if you are going to any other retailer and buying clothes. For many months I have been in the process of developing this line, and when I say developing, I mean the whole process of what it take to get clothes manufactured.</div>
<div>First things first, I develop sketches and think about how I would like the line to look, the next process is me taking different measurements from all over to develop a blended body scale that can fit different body types. The different measurements is how I develop my specs and how I develop my sizes <b>S-XXL. </b>Everything in the market seems to be baggy and I wanted just the opposite. All of my clothes are designed to be fitted, so medium fits like a true medium and if you like to wear your clothes a little baggy order a size up. </div>
<div>Once I narrow down the designs and measurements, next is to have samples made. I use all natural fabrics in my clothes, 100% cotton and wool only for this collection. All of the materials are tested and all of the colors used for dying are tested. My clothes go through every manufacture testing just like any other designer you may have purchased in the past, and you would be happy to know that we do use <b>United States manufacturers</b> to do a lot of our work. </div>
<div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/866673/files/20140918132052-2014-09-18_16.02.15.png?1411071652"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
</div>
<div>Now, I am at my final stage and that's to supply the people like you with the merchandise. The problem I face is that in order to have these ideas brought to life I have to order a minimal number from the manufacture. Its very difficult for manufactures to make orders as you go and as a designer I don't have enough time to make each sweater individual. So like most designers, once we have met our minimal number, I will send off the orders to the manufactures and because I have done all the preliminary work, such as the testing of fabrics, measurements and etc,... it will only take about <b>60 days </b>to process my orders.</div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<div>The risk that I face is just like any other business and that's not having enough capital to fund the project. We have confidence that people will flock to this line just as they did in the past. Its something new so that is always a risk, but you also have the reward of saying I was one the first contributors and I was one of the first to be rocking <b>D'Ira</b>. So many people are  going to ask where did you get that sweater from and they will be all sold out. There is a risk in everything we do in life and this is no different than any other risk, <b>If I don't try then there is no risk</b>, dare to be the next great men fashion designer. I don't see this as risk, more as a challenge and I know I have the ideas to conquer every challenge and its start right here right now.</div> <h3>Questions</h3>
<div>I know I left some things out and right now at this time I couldn't tell you exactly what those things are, but I would love to hear from you. If its a question or just your thoughts about my clothing line feel free to email me with all your questions or concerns and I will be sure to answer them.  And if you have questions about needing to exchange something or swapping an item out, please <b>Email : dira360@yahoo.com</b>

<h3><strong>What is Pangea Empowerment?</strong></h3>

</ul>
<p>These two words combined together symbolize for our team the ability to connect, regardless of geographical location, and enable entrepreneurs from all walks of life in achieving their personal and professional potential. </p>
<p>The genesis of Pangea Empowerment was born on the beautiful North Shores of Laie, Hawaii, where the campus of Brigham Young University - Hawaii (BYU-Hawaii) is located. It was here where a group of dedicated university students and their entrepreneurship professor were invited to teach crowdfunding in Congo, Africa.</p>
<p>Excited as the group was by the invitation, they knew crowdfunding in Africa had serious challenges. To research these challenges they partnered up with Patience, a Ghanaian entrepreneur, and launched this IndieGoGo campaign for her beaded jewelry company.  </p>
<p>From the crowdfunding campaign in Ghana to the crowdfunding conference in Congo an idea began to form. All across the world entrepreneurs are diligently working to come up with new ideas, create new products, and build a legacy for the next up and coming generation. In some areas though, issues such as poverty, hunger, crime, war, and violence impede the entrepreneurship dream. These hampered aspirations could do so much more if entrepreneurs had access to the right tools and opportunities.</p>
<p>Pangea Empowerment's purpose is to fuel the creativity and dreams of entrepreneurs everywhere, but particularly in locations where access to funding and specific technology is severely limited. To accomplish this goal, an academic model of research and teaching is being coupled with entrepreneurial principles and application.</p>

And with a cell phone based tracking system your entire system is now dependent solely on your cell phone battery and apps. During the horrific 911 incident in New York City, these type of tracking systems did not work because cell phones did not work, and the system was over loaded. With White Lyte shoes, you just simply turn on the Parent Unit and turn on the shoe or our new TOT SPOTZ tracker and your on your way. Our system is a closed loop unit and will work even in the underground subways, garage, and buildings. <br/></p>

<br/><p>We strive to keep our products up-to-date and have redesigned White Lyte Shoes/Tot Spotz so that parents and caregivers can remotely turn the shoes/Tot Spotz alarm system on and off and still be able to track your child with the Parent Unit.</p>
<p>For instance when your child is going to school you can remotely turn of the audible and visual alarm as they are in school and turn it back on when they are with you again.  <br/></p>
<p>There may be certain times when you don't want your child's shoe to go into a visual and audible alarm,but still be able to alert you that they are out of your comfort zone.. Such as in a movie theater or Museum or if he or she is sensitive to sight and sound due to Autism (ASD).</p>

For the past two years we have tested and perfected our ""Patent
Pending"",Sentinel Technology, which ensures the integrity of both the
Parent and Child/Adult Units power source and electronic circuits as both units will constantly check each others unit and report any problems with the battery, battery power and or electronics with the use of the visual and audible alarm.</p>
<p>Our products are designed to intentionally malfunction if the Parent / Child Unit are submerged in a large body of water such as a pool, a river, a lake, etc.</p>
<p>If you child was to fall into a pool, lake or any large body of water, White Lyte will malfunction and cause the other unit to go into an alarm state with visual and audible alarm.</p>
<p>White Lyte Shoes / Tot Spotz is a pro-active not reactive system and is not a replacement for proper Child / Special needs adult supervision. White Lyte was designed to enhance the abilities to keep track of Children or Adults of a parent or caregiver, while they are in their  presence, in real time situations.<br/></p>
<p><br/>
Here's how our systems soars above the rest......</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p> Our parent units comes in various sizes and shapes to include our latest
addition one of a kind parent unit FOB with audible and visual alarms. We are
presently working on a two child/adult simultaneous tracking unit (very small
units).</p>
<p><br/><br/>
As a former police officer I know that the best and readily available help in
finding a missing child or adult quickly, is the public. The next time you are
out shopping in a mall or any store see if you can pick out who is an off duty
fireman, policeman, teacher, doctor, etc I think you get what I mean.<br/><br/>
Our products instantly alert the Parents / caregivers and the immediate public
that a child or elderly adult is in need of assistance. <br/><br/><br/>
Here's how it works.....<br/><br/>
The Parent Unit and The Child Unit are continuously checking to see if they are
both connected and are working properly. The flashing red LED on the parent
unit and the child unit indicate all is well.<br/><br/>
In the event your child / adult wanders off and out of range the parent unit
and the child unit will instantly alarm, with a visual and audible alarm that
will continue for approximately 10 hours or until your child returns back into
your range, at which time both units will automatically reset.</p>
<p>Ok are you still with us .... Great.</p>
<p>Let me take you on a journey that will change your life as it did mine. Last year we were the guest of Marilyn and Arnie Weinger of Kids are 1st. They are the greatest crusaders and champions of children safety in the USA. As their guest we were invited to Stephanie's Day, which is a resource fair for families with special needs. Stephanie who has Autism is the ambassador of the event for which it is named.</p>
<p>During the event I personally met the families, relatives, teachers, medical personnel of various young and older children who have Autism (ASD). As I spoke to to the parents and guardians of these precious children, I could see the despair and worry in their eyes.</p>
<p>As we stood there listening to their stories of how they must stay vigilant and never let their children out of their sight , or they may never see them again.</p>
<p>Two mothers pleaded with me to sell them our units no matter what the cost. (The units at that time where set up just for Demo purposes and I could not sell her one, let alone give them these units for free which I would have gladly done if we could).</p>
<p>One mother told me to watch as she let go of her sons hand. He immediately started running away from her with no care or worries. She ran after him and grabbed him and brought him back to our booth and pleaded to me to sell her our product. <br/>I told her that I would do my best to try to get this product to market quickly.</p>
<p>After I returned home to Albuquerque and spoke to our chief engineer Paul Castro about the events in California, I started to learn more about Autism and the behavior of wandering and elopement.</p>

Hi my name is Stewart Walker, I
am the owner of White Lyte Shoes. I want to take you on a Journey that will
change your life forever, as it did mine. I am a former United States Marine
and a former New Mexico Police Officer. During my tour of duty I was a
Cryptographic Repair Technician (Repairing Digital Voice Scramblers). After my enlistment ended I worked for various companies such as Intel Corp, Northrop Grumman,
Los Alamos National Labs to name a few. As a New Mexico Law Enforcement Officer
I encountered numerous cases involving missing and abused children. With my
experience and background in dealing with this subject White Lyte Shoes design
was born in 2006.

                           

White Lyte Shoes is a Real Time Search and Rescue Unit unlike any
other Bluetooth or GPS designed system on the market. Our systems are capable of tracking one or more
children or adults simultaneously using a single parent unit, In real time situations.
                                                   Single Child Parent Unit                                                       (3.7"" x 2.5"" x 1.0"")                                                Two Child  Parent Unit                                                    (3.7"" x 2.5"" x 1.0"")Key Fob Single Child Parent Unit                       Smaller Version of the Above Units            (2.75"" x 1.3"" x 0.68"")                                            (3.2"" x 2.0"" x 0.56"")Unlike GPS systems, there are no additional monthly charges, taxes or fees and our units can be used
any where ( maximum range of Approximately 150 ft ). There is no language
barrier and you don't need a smart phone, computer or internet access to use our system. There are no smart phone apps or computer tracking programs which require a certain time to learn how to use it. And with a cell phone based tracking system your entire system is now dependent solely on your cell phone battery and apps. During the horrific 911 incident in New York City, these type of tracking systems did not work because cell phones did not work, and the system was over loaded. With White Lyte shoes, you just simply turn on the Parent Unit and turn on the shoe or our new TOT SPOTZ tracker and your on your way. Our system is a closed loop unit and will work even in the underground subways, garage, and buildings. 
These Are Tot Spotz and There Hot! What makes these so great is that they will fit on most brands of tennis shoes or sneakers, including your child's present pair of shoes.This is a one time purchase that you can continually use as your child grows and you can put them in most any style shoe you purchase. 
                         
We strive to keep our products up-to-date and have redesigned White Lyte Shoes/Tot Spotz so that parents and caregivers can remotely turn the shoes/Tot Spotz alarm system on and off and still be able to track your child with the Parent Unit.
For instance when your child is going to school you can remotely turn of the audible and visual alarm as they are in school and turn it back on when they are with you again.  
There may be certain times when you don't want your child's shoe to go into a visual and audible alarm,but still be able to alert you that they are out of your comfort zone.. Such as in a movie theater or Museum or if he or she is sensitive to sight and sound due to Autism (ASD).

My first thought was to created something new and handy; that's when I created the first Fallen Angel.The bag was designed after Castiel's signature trench coat, provided enough space to carry items, and had black feather wings for added flare. But why is this important? During my convention time, I was approached by numerous attendees wanting to buy the bag.Osric Chau, shown here in the photo, was even gracious enough to wear my bag, I was also give the opportunity to show Misha Collins himself!When the convention was over I decided to make the bag, but I also decided I was going to donate the proceeds to a wonderful organization.Random Acts is an organization that has grown in strength and created numerous of life changing experiences; not to mention it's creator Misha Collins is the amazing person behind this. They are known for random acts of kindness, Hope 2 Hati, and Endure for kindness.For more information click here. Random ActsWhat We Need & What You GetNow here is what we need from you, the lovely people that you are, and what you can expect from me.UPDATE: If you ordered a bag, you will not be able to receive it until after the campaign is over.

If you wish to donate to just donate,  all those proceeds will go straight to random acts. If any money is unused for supplies, it too will find its' way to Random Acts as well.I will not in any shape or form keep any of the proceeds for myself. We need at least raise $500, not only for those who want the bags, but also to help change the lives of many people!I was also able to make additional items to help raise money. All of which are hand made by me. Check out the photos to see each item up close! (The Bows are made by a fellow member of FandomisaFamily  click here for more information.

She is so sweet and kind so please send some love to her! The book is phenomenal for any Supernatural Fan. A message from Lynn. ""Fangasm"" is the story of two college professors who fell head over heels in love with 'Supernatural' and turned their oh-so-responsible lives upside down.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Lindsey is an 8th grade grammar teacher by day and a rogue crafter by night. Lisa, unable to find employment since losing her job in 2009, has been working on making Erin.Lane her means of support, with the hope that one day Lindsey can quit teaching to help her sew full time.  Together we are the Erin.Lane Organizational Superheroes. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We are a mother and daughter team who are working to rid the knitting world of cluttered, disorganized tools. It started as a weekend project when Lindsey was losing more needles than she could afford.  Mom was always handy with a sewing machine, so we went to work.  After several attempts, we developed something to hold knitting needles neatly and safely. (To see how far we have come, you can get the full story <a href=""http://www.erinlanebags.com/?page_id=30"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""The History of the KnitPack"">here</a>.) Soon people were frequently asking for KnitPacks, as they were dubbed.  Erin.Lane was born.  We quickly realized that people also like knitting bags, and developed new bags to meet the real needs of real crafters.  We developed our canvas ""Bucket"" bag which needed some jazzing up.  With limited funds, we found a used embroidery machine on E-bay and started the whirlwind of embroidering insanity.  Because she is used and shipped and not top of the line, she has many limitations.  </p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>With a new embroidery machine, Erin.Lane would be able to make the world a more beautiful and organized place for fiber enthusiasts the world over.  Our most popular product, the ""Bucket"" needs the assistance of embroidery.  The new embroidery machine will work faster and with a higher stitch quality and allow us to continue offering the embroidered bucket.  Also, with the new machine, we will be able to offer monogrammed buckets to the fiber world as well.  Our current machine does not cut ""jumps"" (the threads that go from letter to letter).  This means that we sit at night and cut these jumps by hand for hours at a time.  The new machine will greatly reduce this process as the software running this machine works to avoid excessive ""jumps.""</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><img align=""none"" alt=""Example of Jumps"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.erinlanebags.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/IMG_7246.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p>
<p>Furthermore, we will be able to embroider a larger area with the new machine.  Where our current machine will only use a 4 X 6 hoop and a 5 X 7 hoop.  The Brother 2800-D can embroider up to a 6 X 10 space and can use up to 6 different size hoops.  It comes with  4 X 4, 5 X 7, and 6 X 10 inch hoops.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Isn't she pretty?...</p>

<p>If we are unable to raise the funds, our current embroidery machine is unlikely to survive the holiday rush.  She will most likely pass out from the volume of work required.  Without the canvas bucket, the fiber crafters of the world will miss out on a unique tool for the organization of their craft.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div>We need $4,500.  This will cover the cost of the machine and the Embroidery Software to allow us to personalize the bags. </div>
<div>
<br/>This machine generally retails at $5,000 plus the $350 for the software. However, we have found the Brother 2800-D at two LOCAL small businesses in our area who have offered to help.  They have quoted us $4,300 for the machine, which is a huge deal especially because these shops are also offering us free training to make sure we get the most out of the machine and her features.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>If we do not reach the full goal, we are hoping to make enough money at our next show, Stitches Midwest, to cover the short fall. If we do not make at least half of our goal, we will have to bank the money and save until the goal can be reached. </div>

<p>Up until then, we, like most people, considered the Beanbag to be a predominantly large, static indoor piece of furniture. We loved it, but it just wasn’t practical to take anywhere we wanted to. </p>
<p>We felt the Beanbag should and could evolve into something that would better suit our family’s active outdoor lifestyle. So we set out to create: </p>
<ul>
<li>A beanbag that was compact enough to be folded </li>
<li>One with an innovative design that allowed it to be carried anywhere easily</li>
<li>While retaining the iconic cozy comfort of the classic Beanbag </li>
</ul>
<p>That started us on this journey. We have been planning strategies, drawing designs, testing fabrics, and relaxing in prototypes for the past three years, and we’re just getting going. </p>
<p>This journey has been made easier through working with some of the most talented textile professionals in Sydney. The careful craftsmanship and skill of these women has been instrumental in making this unique product look and feel fantastic. </p>

Please share Bean About with your friends and family on:Facebook /// Instagram /// TwitterFor PRESS INQUIRIES please contact: vanessa@mybeanabout.comClick here for Press Kit images and write ups. The Bean About is the evolution of the good old beanbag. It’s as comfortable & supportive as a full size beanbag, and with its clever, original design, it’s as portable as a backpack!BEAN ABOUT ™ | The foldable beanbag that goes anywhere!      To begin with we will offer 2 adult and 3 creative kids designs made from durable, waterproof, polyester. The kid’s bags are 7% smaller in size and a custom fit for little ones as young as 3.Our kid’s bags are extra special because they represent 3 critically endangered species... the Tiger, Mountain Gorilla and Rock Wallaby. Through your support we will be making quarterly donations to 3 front line organisations fighting to preserve these amazing creatures:
TRAFFIC
Virunga National Park and
The Australian Wildlife Conservancy
We will also be telling their stories and sharing fascinating facts about these animals on our website and blog to bring awareness to their situation.In addition to conservation, we love the diversity and expression of art and have commissioned the amazing Mulga the Artist to design the Mountain Gorilla bag, featuring Julio the Tree Hugger. This focus on art and conservation will be something we continue over time by promoting artists and worthy causes. Not only do we want to be comfortable in our world. We want a better world to be comfortable in.  Watch Mulga the Artist in action and see his illustration come to life!Andy and I love the supreme comfort of the iconic beanbag and after one too many kids’ parties, uncomfortably standing about or sitting in the grass we thought... Wouldn't it be great to have a small, foldable beanbag that you could take anywhere! 
Up until then, we, like most people, considered the Beanbag to be a predominantly large, static indoor piece of furniture. We loved it, but it just wasn’t practical to take anywhere we wanted to. 
We felt the Beanbag should and could evolve into something that would better suit our family’s active outdoor lifestyle. So we set out to create: 

A beanbag that was compact enough to be folded 
One with an innovative design that allowed it to be carried anywhere easily
While retaining the iconic cozy comfort of the classic Beanbag 

That started us on this journey. We have been planning strategies, drawing designs, testing fabrics, and relaxing in prototypes for the past three years, and we’re just getting going. 
This journey has been made easier through working with some of the most talented textile professionals in Sydney. The careful craftsmanship and skill of these women has been instrumental in making this unique product look and feel fantastic. 
    Designing the Bean AboutWe knew that supporting the spine was the most important thing when it came to designing the Bean About, but we also wanted to retain enough wrap around comfort to keep it cozy. Finding just the right amount of beans to keep the Bean About compact yet iconic was a matter of fine-tuning. It’s unique design allows for a minimum amount of beans. In-fact, we use LESS THAN HALF of an average adult sized beanbag. This makes it light enough for kids, compact enough to be folded, and easier to carry, while minimizing the impact on the environment. Then we added straps to the back of the bag for portability, 2 pockets on the outside to secure valuables, and 3 more pockets on the inside for a drink, some snacks, and anything else one might need while relaxing at the park or on the beach.Using bean distribution the Bean About operates best when it’s just over half full so that it can be folded. Then due to weight distribution the Bean About feels completely full when you're seated!      The bag is deployed by unhooking the wooden toggle and shaking the beans down to the pointed back rest end.----------------------------------------------------  Once the beans are there just flip the bag onto the ground like laying a picnic blanket out. This will contain the beans firmly into the backrest area.----------------------------------------------------  Then give the Beans a little pat around the centre of the bag to move some down towards your bottom area before taking a seat.---------------------------------------------------- When you’re ready to go, just shake the beans back to the blunt end, lay the bag on the ground and fasten the toggle.

Short Summary 

Luke Mickelson traces both sides of his family
back to they days when Wyoming was a U.S. Territory. Businessmen, a sheriff and even an
outlaw — they’re all in his family tree. He grew up around ranches,
worked his share of cattle, got bucked off his share of horses and more than a few
bulls too. So, yes, you could say he knows the difference between a rank horse
and a stick horse or real cowboy wear from wanna-be cowboy stuff.
Roger Carpenter moved ""west"" in 2003 after 30 years
in Los Angeles where he designed many of the movie posters that hung in all our
teenage bedrooms — Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, Risky Business and
Planet of the Apes — not to mention those memorable Levi jean ads which created
a generation of urban cowboys.
These two teamed up to create Crazy Cowboy
Company in, where else, Laramie, Wyoming.


Last year, Luke (shown above wearing his ""Buck U"" T-shirt) and Roger raised capital, secured copyright protection, and created an e-com store to produce Crazy Cowboy apparel for men, women and children under the ""Buck U,"" ""Crazy Cowboy Company,"" and ""Lil' Bucker"" labels. Their Facebook friends have grown from a few family members to over 500 in just a few months.
Success with T-shirts, sweatshirts and caps is
relatively affordable. But, understanding that a trophy belt buckle is to a cowboy what a gold
medal is to an Olympic athlete, we sure didn’t want to make a ""bottle cap"" lightweight
piece of stamped metal. We had to do it right or not at all.
Roger collaborated with world-renowned type
designer Peter Greco to create the artwork before talking to Western Heritage Foundry in Loveland, Colorado where they've been making belt buckles for The US Forest Service for over 25 years. The
artisans there hand sculpted the die to match the artwork shown above, then cast the prototype using the same techniques they learned from their
daddies and granddaddies. You can see for your self that the result is worth the
effort and expense.


NUMBER ONE: We wanted to create something
extraordinary — the best trophy belt buckle in the world and we believe we did! 
Now it's our greatest wish that all these young cowboys purchase our belt buckles. But it doesn't stop there. It’s CCC’s goal to be a part of making a
difference in the rodeo community. Your contribution helps us create the beginning of a more
profitable extension of our business, giving us the
potential to collaborate on support programs designed specifically to help
bull riders.
What We Need & What
You Get
We’re asking for $100,000 to create “Midnight
Rodeo” belt buckles for men. So far Roger and Luke have spent just under
$10,000 to produce the buckle prototype and that fabulous video you just
watched. Quality work doesn’t come cheap.  
We will effectively use $50,000 for the initial casting set-up, limited production and packaging of the first production run of solid brass
belt buckles plus a smaller run of gold and silver buckles offered as a
premium for higher contribution gifts.
We anticipate using another $50,000 to offset
advertising, promotion and some operating expenses— all that it will take
to get these belt buckles in the hands of all those cowboys who want to sport
our Midnight Cowboy style, no matter whether they ride horses or bulls or just
drive their trucks to work!
Combined, that’s $100,000 to help us get us
through the launch of Midnight Rodeo.
You can contribute to helping Crazy Cowboy
Company ride this family of Midnight Cowboy belt buckles into the arena by giving at one of the eleven different levels shown. Please indicate the size that best fits you and the color/s you like. We'll do our best to make sure we get you what you ordered but supplies are limited.


The Impact
We’ve been all across the great state of Wyoming
from Jackson to Cheyenne and back to Laramie. Everyone who knows Crazy Cowboy
Company and “Buck U” tells us that we’ve got a runaway hit with “Midnight
Rodeo.”
Luke has been stopped more than once and asked to
sell his “Buck U” T-shirt off his back. One girl even followed him home saying
she’d do “anything” to get his shirt. The young cowboys who have seen our
prototype “Midnight Rodeo” belt buckle are on a waiting list to buy it.So it’s only a matter of having the capital to
launch the product, to build the 'must have' brand for all those cowboys out
there — real and 'wanna be'.  Your help will make the difference, and you
could be the first in your circle of friends to wear the Midnight Rodeo buckle.

And we don't want it to stop at Crazy Cowboy
Company. The successful launch of the line enables a more profitable extension
of the CCC business, thereby helping our company to support programs designed
specifically to help bull riders.

<p>At Liquid Screen Design we are on the cutting edge of t-shirt technology!  We have pioneered custom lazer t-shirts, glow in the dark printing, UV color change and now Heat Reaction t-shirts!</p>
<h1>**PROJECT**</h1>
<p>Heat Reaction t-shirts are regular t-shirts that are treated with a chemical process that makes them react to temperature.  We have already figured out the process (see our Indiegogo project video or the videos on the gallery page), but we need to make the process more affordable.  This is where you come in!  We need your help so we can take Heat Reaction shirts to the masses.</p>
<h1>**INSPIRATION**</h1>
<p>For our very first project on Indiegogo, we wanted to bring forward a one-of-its-kind product. Everybody has a closet full of t-shirts.  You get a t-shirt at a charity walk.  You get one when you join a fraternity or sorority.  You even get a t-shirt when you sign up for a credit card.  We wanted to come up with a unique t-shirt that you’ve probably never seen before.  That’s why we’re bringing you the Heat Reaction t-shirt. </p>
<p>We think that you will love these amazing t-shirts.  Over the past year as we've tested the technology and worked out the kinks, the reaction to these t-shirts has been nothing less than mind-blowing.  Everyone wants to know how to get these color-changing t-shirts for themselves.  We are ready to bring these to market, but need assistance in making them available to everyone.</p>
<h1>**F.A.Q.**</h1>
<p>Q.  How do you wash these t-shirts?<br/>A.  Same as any other clothing - regular wash cycle, dry on low heat.  Low heat when drying is important to preserve the heat reactive qualities of the shirt.</p>
<p>Q.  What if I live outside of North America?  Can I still get a Heat Reaction t-shirt?<br/>A.  Right now on Indiegogo, we are not able to offer international shipping.  Hopefully in the future, we'll be able to do this.</p>
<p>Q.  I have another question.  What should I do? <br/>A.  Contact us through Indiegogo.  We will get back to you promptly and answer any questions.</p>
