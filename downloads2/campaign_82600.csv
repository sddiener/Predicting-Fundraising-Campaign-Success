<b>Point sur la situation au 27/10/2015 :</b><br/>Comme vous pouvez le voir ce n'est pas une campagne facile! Mais je ne vais pas abandonner, vous êtes déjà 60 personnes à bord, j'irai jusque au bout! J'ai décidé de réduire le budget video afin de consacrer l'argent qui sera récolté à la réalisation de ce double CD album et de ma publication dans le livret. Plus haut nous arriverons dans la collecte, meilleures seront mes conditions de travail et de réalisation de ce projet, cette découverte que j'ai fait sur Bach le mérite...</blockquote>
<h3>En quoi consiste ce projet ?</h3>Ce projet concerne le violoncelle baroque ainsi que les Suites pour violoncelle seul de Jean-Sébastien Bach.<p> </p>
</div>
<div>Le 9 octobre 2014, j'ai fait une découverte importante en ce qui concerne l'écriture des 6 Suites pour violoncelle seul de JS Bach. Cette découverte m'a menée à faire des recherches aussi bien du côté historique que du côté du violoncelle baroque en lui même. J'ai alors décidé de préparer un enregistrement audio et video des suites et de rédiger une publication.</div>
<div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Comment en suis-je arrivée là?</h3>
<p>En 2010 j'ai commencé à me passionner pour le répertoire pour violoncelle seul de Bach à Ligeti. Pendant 4 ans j'ai travaillé principalement sur la recherche du son, optimiser le son de son instrument par le geste, la posture  la respiration. Devenir l'instrument du violoncelle et non le contraire comme il se fait genéralement.<br/>En septembre 2014 j'ai démenagé à Berlin dans l'intention de continuer mes recherches sur le son mais avec le violoncelle baroque. J'ai eu la chance d'en trouver un à Leipzig, ville de J.S. Bach. C'est alors qu'à commencé mon voyage vers Bach, le violoncelle baroque et les 6 Suites.<br/><br/>Je me suis consacrée à plein temps dans ce projet depuis mon arrivée à Berlin en 2014. Un an plus tard, je veux pouvoir partager mon travail ainsi que la découverte que j'ai fait sur les suites en octobre dernier.</p>
<h3>Pourquoi soutenir ce projet?</h3>
<p>Parce qu'il a quelque chose d'unique et d'innovant dans les Suites de Bach et dans le son du violoncelle baroque.<br/><br/>La publication de ma découverte va ouvrir un nouveau débat et apporter un nouveau son au violoncelle baroque. Plus rond et plus résonnant.</p>
<h3>Pourquoi vous? Plusieurs possibilités :</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Nous nous connaissons et vous savez combien ce projet me tient à coeur, et combien il est important. J'ai besoin de vous pour aller jusqu'àu bout de mon projet.</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Nous ne nous connaissons pas mais on vous a parlé de moi en vous disant qu'il fallait me soutenir et que j'avais besoin de vous. C'est vrai... !</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Vous êtes arrivé là par hazard. Peut-être vous dites vous que pour y avoir consacré une année à plein temps, ma découverte doit être réelllement importante. Vous avez raison! Si vous aimez Bach ce projet est vraiment pour vous, et si vous ne connaissez pas bien sa musique ou peu, c'est alors l'occasion de découvrir ou redécouvrir ce chef d'oeuvre pour violoncelle seul.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3>Qui est derrière ce projet?</h3>
<div>Moi même, j'ai tout fait depuis ma découverte. <br/>J'ai reçu les précieux conseils de Ton Koopman, mais aussi de Hans Reiners à Berlin ( auteur des archets avec lesquels je joue), ainsi que ceux de Daniel J. König, luthier à Leipzig qui est l'auteur du violoncelle baroque que je loue pour ce projet (et que vous voyez sur les photos). </div>
<div>Pour ce qui est de cette campagne, c'est moi qui l'ai conçue et rédigée, c'est aussi moi qui la gère. Hello Stage (<a href=""http://www.hellostage.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.hellostage.com</a>) m'a guidé et conseillé tout au long de cette année, ils ont été les premiers à m'apporter leur soutien dans cette aventure. C'est grâce à Hello Stage que j'ai pu rencontrer Maestro Koopman, jouer pour lui,  lui poser des questions et recevoir ses précieux conseils.</div>

J'ai grandi dans le Médoc puis sur le Bassin d'Arcachon. C'est un dimanche, à Lesparre Médoc, que j'ai rencontré Jean-Sébastien Bach.. L'organiste, était un ami de mes parents, il  adorait jouer Bach à la sortie de la messe. Moi, j'étais fascinée par la puissance de cet instrument mais aussi par les harmonies qu'il dégageait. </div>
<div>J'avais 3 ans 1/2 quand j'ai commencé le piano. J'assistais aux cours de piano de ma soeur aînée avec un tel bonheur que son professeur a proposé à ma mère de me donner des cours, j'ai alors courru au piano, je me souviens de ce moment.</div>
<div>J'ai commencé le violoncelle plus tard, à 12 ans. Le jour ou je l'ai vu et entendu  pour la première fois, j'ai aussitôt demandé à ma mère de prendre des cours. La suite.... des heures innombrables de gammes et d'études, mais aussi des stages, des concours, des ampoules, des tendinites, et des pleurs aussi,  l'apprentissage!</div>
<div>J'ai travaillé avec Etienne Péclard, Roland Pidoux, Yvan Chiffoleau en France, puis avec David Premo et Anne Williams aux Etats Unis où j'ai vécu 7 ans. A la fin de mes études j'ai déménagé à Madrid ou j'ai vécu et travaillé 6 ans avant de venir à Berlin.</div>
<div>Au résultat cela donne quelque chose comme ça:</div>

<div>Dès mon arrivée à Berlin, j'ai été accueillie et aidée par des personnes du milieu baroque. Cette année a été une expérience extraordinaire, il me semble impossible de ne pas la poursuivre par le partage de tout ce que j'ai découvert, et recherché.</div>

A professional video performance (only if I reach the objective)


The campaign as of today 31/10/2015 :) !I will make this project happen no matter what, using every Euro at its best :) There is no small donation, every donation is a smile and a ""Go for it Marianne!"". The higher we get, the easier it will be for me ! Merci!

ABOUT?

 
 

Bach and his wonderful Suites for Violoncello
It is about a new sound of the Baroque Cello, its set up and technique based on the discovery I made a year ago.


 
What is the project goal and who is the project for?
This project is for all the Bach Lovers and soon to be ;) 
 
Doors to a new sound of the baroque cello will be opened and first revealed on the Bach Suites CD Album. The booklet will be about my discovery, sharing with you all of the research and answers I have found during this past year. In addition to the Cd album and the publication,  I want to publish a video performance. 
Having dedicated all my time to investigate all sound possibilities of the cello with a variety of different set ups, different bows and gut strings I am adding my piece to the puzzle of the baroque sound...
 
Why would you support this project?



 
 

Because it's about Bach! But most of all it is about the sound, the resonance, the baroque cello and my discovery...
 

How will I use the money if the project is successfully funded? 


 
 

The money will be used for 

the realization of this Album (2 CD) 
The booklet with my publication about the discovery and pictures.
The rent of the cellos for this project (the cello and the piccolo cello).
Gut strings.

And then:
A professional video of a performance of the Suites.


 
 
Who are the people behind the project?
 
 

I am on my own in this project. 
During this year I met people from the ""Baroque world"" who helped me and made a difference in my research/work : Maestro Ton Koopman, my bow maker Hans Reiners, the wonderful maker of the baroque cello I am playing : Daniel J. König. 
Hello Stage (see hellostage.com ) believed in my Bach project from the beginning they have been helpful and supportive, they gave me wonderful advice and helped me a lot during this journey. (If you are a professional musician , check the 55€ reward!) 
Who Am I ?

 


I am a cellist, in Love with Bach and the baroque Cello.
My name is Marianne Dumas, I was born in France, as far as I can remember, my love for Bach started when I was 3 when the organist of the church would play Bach for the opening and the closing of the service. 
Me at 3  ->      Me now ->      
 I remember spending the whole services looking at the pipes of the Organ amazed by what I was hearing, Bach was the god I was cherishing. I started playing piano when I was 3,5 and then cello at 12.


I see in Bach all the beauty of the world, I find answers and inspiration. The cello is my passion, music is the voice of our soul, it is one of the most beautiful way to connect and share with people, all origins and languages. 

I did my undergraduate studies in France and then moved to Pittsburgh, USA, completed my Master Degree and Performer Diploma in Carnegie Mellon University. I love orchestra, chamber music, teaching : it is all about sharing. After 7 years in the USA, I moved to Spain where I worked during 6 years.

So to make it simple... France / USA / Spain / Germany

I was always a little frustrated when I would play the Bach suites on my modern cello, the cello had too much tension, this is why I decided to get a baroque cello and baroque bow (really special...) and started my search of the sound I had in mind. In September 2014, I moved to Berlin and started my journey to the sound and to Bach.
It has been an amazing experience, coming to Germany was one of the best decision I took in my life. I am learning this beautiful language and living in Bach's beautiful country.
I want to share all of what I have explored and learned through this journey with you, and for that I need... you !It is not about how much you will give, it is about solidarity, believing that when you have a dream, it can become reality.
Thank you for ""Baching"" me up !

Point sur la situation au 27/10/2015 :Comme vous pouvez le voir ce n'est pas une campagne facile! Mais je ne vais pas abandonner, vous êtes déjà 60 personnes à bord, j'irai jusque au bout! J'ai décidé de réduire le budget video afin de consacrer l'argent qui sera récolté à la réalisation de ce double CD album et de ma publication dans le livret. Plus haut nous arriverons dans la collecte, meilleures seront mes conditions de travail et de réalisation de ce projet, cette découverte que j'ai fait sur Bach le mérite...
En quoi consiste ce projet ?Ce projet concerne le violoncelle baroque ainsi que les Suites pour violoncelle seul de Jean-Sébastien Bach. 

Le 9 octobre 2014, j'ai fait une découverte importante en ce qui concerne l'écriture des 6 Suites pour violoncelle seul de JS Bach. Cette découverte m'a menée à faire des recherches aussi bien du côté historique que du côté du violoncelle baroque en lui même. J'ai alors décidé de préparer un enregistrement audio et video des suites et de rédiger une publication.

 
Comment en suis-je arrivée là?
En 2010 j'ai commencé à me passionner pour le répertoire pour violoncelle seul de Bach à Ligeti. Pendant 4 ans j'ai travaillé principalement sur la recherche du son, optimiser le son de son instrument par le geste, la posture  la respiration. Devenir l'instrument du violoncelle et non le contraire comme il se fait genéralement.En septembre 2014 j'ai démenagé à Berlin dans l'intention de continuer mes recherches sur le son mais avec le violoncelle baroque. J'ai eu la chance d'en trouver un à Leipzig, ville de J.S. Bach. C'est alors qu'à commencé mon voyage vers Bach, le violoncelle baroque et les 6 Suites.Je me suis consacrée à plein temps dans ce projet depuis mon arrivée à Berlin en 2014. Un an plus tard, je veux pouvoir partager mon travail ainsi que la découverte que j'ai fait sur les suites en octobre dernier.
Pourquoi soutenir ce projet?
Parce qu'il a quelque chose d'unique et d'innovant dans les Suites de Bach et dans le son du violoncelle baroque.La publication de ma découverte va ouvrir un nouveau débat et apporter un nouveau son au violoncelle baroque. Plus rond et plus résonnant.
Pourquoi vous? Plusieurs possibilités :
 

Nous nous connaissons et vous savez combien ce projet me tient à coeur, et combien il est important. J'ai besoin de vous pour aller jusqu'àu bout de mon projet.
Nous ne nous connaissons pas mais on vous a parlé de moi en vous disant qu'il fallait me soutenir et que j'avais besoin de vous. C'est vrai... !
Vous êtes arrivé là par hazard. Peut-être vous dites vous que pour y avoir consacré une année à plein temps, ma découverte doit être réelllement importante. Vous avez raison! Si vous aimez Bach ce projet est vraiment pour vous, et si vous ne connaissez pas bien sa musique ou peu, c'est alors l'occasion de découvrir ou redécouvrir ce chef d'oeuvre pour violoncelle seul.

Qui est derrière ce projet?
Moi même, j'ai tout fait depuis ma découverte. J'ai reçu les précieux conseils de Ton Koopman, mais aussi de Hans Reiners à Berlin ( auteur des archets avec lesquels je joue), ainsi que ceux de Daniel J. König, luthier à Leipzig qui est l'auteur du violoncelle baroque que je loue pour ce projet (et que vous voyez sur les photos). 
Pour ce qui est de cette campagne, c'est moi qui l'ai conçue et rédigée, c'est aussi moi qui la gère. Hello Stage (www.hellostage.com) m'a guidé et conseillé tout au long de cette année, ils ont été les premiers à m'apporter leur soutien dans cette aventure. C'est grâce à Hello Stage que j'ai pu rencontrer Maestro Koopman, jouer pour lui,  lui poser des questions et recevoir ses précieux conseils.
Quelle est la répartition du budget?

 

Enregistrement: 3500€
Conception, réalisation, production, post-production du double album avec livret (1000 exemplaires) : environ 7000 €

Sous-total pour la réalisation du double album avec livret: 10750 €

Frais annexes à l'enregistrement: (déplacement, hébergement, donation pour l'église, repas) : 1200€
Location des violoncelles: 2000€


Frais Indiegogo et Paypal : 5% du total, Paypal 3% par opération
+ Frais des contreparties 
Le reste pour la réalisation d'une video professionelle des suites (4 jours de filmage + montage).

Qui suis-je?   


 
 Je m'appelle Marianne Dumas, je suis française, née à Bordeaux. J'ai grandi dans le Médoc puis sur le Bassin d'Arcachon. C'est un dimanche, à Lesparre Médoc, que j'ai rencontré Jean-Sébastien Bach.. L'organiste, était un ami de mes parents, il  adorait jouer Bach à la sortie de la messe. Moi, j'étais fascinée par la puissance de cet instrument mais aussi par les harmonies qu'il dégageait. 
J'avais 3 ans 1/2 quand j'ai commencé le piano. J'assistais aux cours de piano de ma soeur aînée avec un tel bonheur que son professeur a proposé à ma mère de me donner des cours, j'ai alors courru au piano, je me souviens de ce moment.
J'ai commencé le violoncelle plus tard, à 12 ans. Le jour ou je l'ai vu et entendu  pour la première fois, j'ai aussitôt demandé à ma mère de prendre des cours. La suite.... des heures innombrables de gammes et d'études, mais aussi des stages, des concours, des ampoules, des tendinites, et des pleurs aussi,  l'apprentissage!
J'ai travaillé avec Etienne Péclard, Roland Pidoux, Yvan Chiffoleau en France, puis avec David Premo et Anne Williams aux Etats Unis où j'ai vécu 7 ans. A la fin de mes études j'ai déménagé à Madrid ou j'ai vécu et travaillé 6 ans avant de venir à Berlin.
Au résultat cela donne quelque chose comme ça:

Dès mon arrivée à Berlin, j'ai été accueillie et aidée par des personnes du milieu baroque. Cette année a été une expérience extraordinaire, il me semble impossible de ne pas la poursuivre par le partage de tout ce que j'ai découvert, et recherché.

<p>We are in an interesting semi-catch-22 situation. There are Venues that would love to hire us. These Venues would allow us to move to the next level in reaching out and connecting to new audiences, better pay and more creative endeavors. However to book these Venues, we have to have a product i.e.  a CD. In order to be able to make a CD, we have to have the funding in place. And in order to receive the funding, we have to reach a wider audience. So to that end, the  Relaunch. Our first campaign was launched during the Summer.  We  have a nick name for the Summer in Tucson...... The Season of Hell. People leave the city. They travel and go to cooler climes. We thought that wouldn't matter because  of social media and the internet. But we think it was a factor in not being able to reach our goal the first time. Added to that, one of our members suffered an unexpected death in the Family.</p>
<p>Now as the summer heat is winding down, the city is full again. Students are back at the University, people are back from traveling and the Snowbirds (escapees from the brutal winter) have arrived. As the rest of the Country prepares for the deep cold  and semi-hibernation, Tucson comes alive and enters it's busy season.  So we are very optimistic about this campaign. If you donated to the first campaign, A Big Hellacious Thank You!!!!!! I cannot tell you how much it means to us. And your PERKS!! will be a-comimg.  Send this out upon the Cyber Sea and help us reach as many people as possible.   For those new to the campaign, check out our PERKS!!!!   We have a level for everyone and All donations are very deeply appreciated.<br/></p>

   Opportunities and Challenges
We are in an interesting semi-catch-22 situation. There are Venues that would love to hire us. These Venues would allow us to move to the next level in reaching out and connecting to new audiences, better pay and more creative endeavors. However to book these Venues, we have to have a product i.e.  a CD. In order to be able to make a CD, we have to have the funding in place. And in order to receive the funding, we have to reach a wider audience. So to that end, the  Relaunch. Our first campaign was launched during the Summer.  We  have a nick name for the Summer in Tucson...... The Season of Hell. People leave the city. They travel and go to cooler climes. We thought that wouldn't matter because  of social media and the internet. But we think it was a factor in not being able to reach our goal the first time. Added to that, one of our members suffered an unexpected death in the Family.
Now as the summer heat is winding down, the city is full again. Students are back at the University, people are back from traveling and the Snowbirds (escapees from the brutal winter) have arrived. As the rest of the Country prepares for the deep cold  and semi-hibernation, Tucson comes alive and enters it's busy season.  So we are very optimistic about this campaign. If you donated to the first campaign, A Big Hellacious Thank You!!!!!! I cannot tell you how much it means to us. And your PERKS!! will be a-comimg.  Send this out upon the Cyber Sea and help us reach as many people as possible.   For those new to the campaign, check out our PERKS!!!!   We have a level for everyone and All donations are very deeply appreciated.",4.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<h3>LOVE is a RICOCHET: <br/>What we need/what you receive</h3>
<p>It's an interesting time in the music business. We as artists and musicians understand that music isn't free, yet that concept is prevalent among a listening audience that streams and downloads without having bought albums, CDs or even singles - ever. Our reality is this: untold hours in the studio producing this gorgeous project, and it shows like a peacock in the snow. Ricochet is also graced by the <b>substantial time &amp; talents of many of Southeast Iowa's top musicians</b>, including: George Foster (bass), David Hurlin (drums), Eric Hurlin (keys, organ), Lauryn Shapter (violin), Tim Britton(flute, whistle, mando), Phoenix Jordan (vocals, keys), Steve and Michaela McLain (vocals), Ed Raines (sax), Sara Sanders (vocals) and Donna Nelson (cello). We are so very blessed to swim in this talent pool.</p>
<p>Five months into this focused leg of the album, we are finished - tomorrow the music is off to manufacturing. EXCITED HERE!! - a new (albeit plastic) baby is about to be born. And you can help - we need the village to raise this baby to it's full potential. In return, <b><i>we have set a range of gifts and ""perks"" for anyone who contributes to this campaign.</i></b> The perk packages are connected to the donation buttons on this page. They range from pre-purchasing a $10 download card for a digital version of the entire album, to a signed CD for $25; from an intimate house concert for you and your friends, to covering some of the studio costs with a check written to Pied Piper Productions.This is a way that you can support the arts in a very direct and meaningful way - by checking out the perk packages or donating any amount that works for you.  Many options, all appreciated! </p>

<h3>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Breaking the $ Down&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</h3>
<p>I have set the <b>minimum goal </b>for this crowd funding campaign at<b> $8150</b>. <br/><b>Here's how that breaks down:</b></p>
<p><b>+$4000 for the studio &amp; engineer,</b> about half of what will be owed for the countless hours creating this gorgeous recording <br/><b>+$1800 in studio musician fees </b><br/>+$250 for the beautiful CD artwork<br/><b><i>+$1200 for manufacturing CDs &amp; Download Cards:</i></b> glass master, packaging, shrink-wrapping, etc.<br/>+$500+ for ""Mastering"" the tracks- a required final step after mixing and before manufacturing<br/>+$350 for <b><i>one of the best online MUSIC PLACEMENT SERVICES</i></b>/lists (per year) for licensing the songs<br/>+$25 for a <b>UPC Bar Code </b>(stores require them to sell CDs)<br/></p>

<h3>A Peak Along the Timeline...</h3>

<p>4 years ago, while launching an inspirational CD called “How Spirit Sings” and smack-dab in the heart of 5 years with my brilliant songwriting partner Heather Love, we enthusiastically began a campaign to create the Ricochet CD. Back then, in the middle of Heather's brain injury, we raised $1200 here on IndieGoGo and pre-sales of that much again, which we used to record acoustic gems like “Sidestep”, ""Troubled"" and “I Fell"". We were able to<b> pay some wonderful studio musicians</b> as well as the studio/engineer as we put a marker in the ground for<b> </b>“Ricochet 2011”.<b><i> If you are one of the friends and fans who helped with those early steps toward Ricochet, your CDs </i>are<i> still coming with our thanks for your patience!</i> </b> I wonder what that original CD would have sounded like...

<p></p>
<p>Suffices to say that this CD is extraordinary.
It's filled with deep light and a path through sorrow. It is
imagistic and powerful and tapestry-like. It's folky and funky, full
of beautiful harmonies and musical hooks that stick in your brain. I have never been more excited

In a NUTSHELL:Over 4 years in process & full-on recording past 5 months, we are here to bring beauty to our world, to put our small Iowa town on the musical map & create a model for mature musicians to place quality music into film music libraries and onto the albums of well-known artists through LICENSING. Of course we also want our versions - these gorgeous pieces of art for which we unzipped our chests a thousand times over in the recording process - to reach a diverse and expanded audience. YES! They stand alone as world-class wonderful. Now it's time to pay the piper. In the process of funding, releasing and placing these songs, we can create a model for other talented writers to use. Donate or pre-purchase the new Ricochet album = manufacturing, recording, musician fees paid. In return we offer CDs, downloads, concerts and that model I mentioned - PERKS FOR YOUR SUPPORT! 

The Who-What-Why
My name is Sharon Bousquet, and I am a life-long musician and a lucky mom. As a  singer-songwriter, published poet, seminar leader and a member of the diverse and extraordinary arts community in Fairfield, Iowa, my musical partners and I are recording an extraordinary album project titled Ricochet. Beautiful and inspired songs, professionally recorded - the launch of an income dream in music licensing to fund this mature musician's future, paving the way for more recognition of the extraordinary talent in my home town and a model for skilled, talented players to get their music heard by those who want to pay for it. Here's a bit of my story.

25 years of music-making (and child-raising) has brought the release of  6 albums of original Bousquet music plus inclusion on two compilation CDs. I've succeeded in placing numerous songs in independent Hollywood feature film
projects and a promotional short film or two, receiving a scoring credit for the Hollywood independent feature film ""Cosmic Radio"" - due for release on
Netflix any minute. Now a big transition arrives at my door:  my youngest son Tomas graduates in June, marking the second half of my life as a musician-mom. I am here to put some ducks in order for my very successful musical future, and in so doing create a model for others to do the same.

""Licensing"" is a sustainable way to mature as a working musician. To get paid for 25 years of work via royalties and licensing fees from films and tv shows that pay to use original music. Success at licensing the songs on Ricochet and future projects will allow me to continue making music that's true to my nature and a boon to listeners: bright, deeply felt and inspired gems that make use of the deep talent pool in our entrepreneurial. artsy town of Fairfield, Iowa. Then we look to use that experience to create a model for other talented artists around the world to do the same. 



LOVE is a RICOCHET: What we need/what you receive
It's an interesting time in the music business. We as artists and musicians understand that music isn't free, yet that concept is prevalent among a listening audience that streams and downloads without having bought albums, CDs or even singles - ever. Our reality is this: untold hours in the studio producing this gorgeous project, and it shows like a peacock in the snow. Ricochet is also graced by the substantial time & talents of many of Southeast Iowa's top musicians, including: George Foster (bass), David Hurlin (drums), Eric Hurlin (keys, organ), Lauryn Shapter (violin), Tim Britton(flute, whistle, mando), Phoenix Jordan (vocals, keys), Steve and Michaela McLain (vocals), Ed Raines (sax), Sara Sanders (vocals) and Donna Nelson (cello). We are so very blessed to swim in this talent pool.
Five months into this focused leg of the album, we are finished - tomorrow the music is off to manufacturing. EXCITED HERE!! - a new (albeit plastic) baby is about to be born. And you can help - we need the village to raise this baby to it's full potential. In return, we have set a range of gifts and ""perks"" for anyone who contributes to this campaign. The perk packages are connected to the donation buttons on this page. They range from pre-purchasing a $10 download card for a digital version of the entire album, to a signed CD for $25; from an intimate house concert for you and your friends, to covering some of the studio costs with a check written to Pied Piper Productions.This is a way that you can support the arts in a very direct and meaningful way - by checking out the perk packages or donating any amount that works for you.  Many options, all appreciated! 

>>>>>>>>>Breaking the $ Down<<<<<<<<<<
NOTE: All funds gratefully accepted, and PayPal strongly preferred whether using credit card (via PP) or your PP balance. This way the $ gets to us NOW as opposed to late March (2 wks after end of campaign if direct cc payment).
>>>>>>>>>Breaking the $ Down<<<<<<<<<<
I have set the minimum goal for this crowd funding campaign at $8150. Here's how that breaks down:
+$4000 for the studio & engineer, about half of what will be owed for the countless hours creating this gorgeous recording +$1800 in studio musician fees +$250 for the beautiful CD artwork+$1200 for manufacturing CDs & Download Cards: glass master, packaging, shrink-wrapping, etc.+$500+ for ""Mastering"" the tracks- a required final step after mixing and before manufacturing+$350 for one of the best online MUSIC PLACEMENT SERVICES/lists (per year) for licensing the songs+$25 for a UPC Bar Code (stores require them to sell CDs)
If we are supported beyond this first measure, the next phase looks like this:+$550 for an introductory trip to BMI in Nashville for co-writing & putting a face on these songs+$250 plus for Merchandise = T shirts, stickers, Ricochet underwear..kidding! :) +$4K for Tim's services at Pied Piper (the 2nd payment for studio & engineer)+$70 for 2 Commemorative ""Ricochet"" Plaques – a gold CD with CD info plaque, framed for the studio and one for the artist+$$ A new website for licensing the catalog at Love-Buzz Music Publishing+$$ Marketing budget for song pluggers (radio), online and print ads; office help/data entry/marketing assistant's wages at $10/hr to upload, input and update 10 online music pages and platforms

(Phoenix, Sara and Sharon were in the studio on Valentine's Day BRINGIN' the LOVE: recording harmonies on SB's funky song, ""Only Game in Town"". YES!




A Peak Along the Timeline...

4 years ago, while launching an inspirational CD called “How Spirit Sings” and smack-dab in the heart of 5 years with my brilliant songwriting partner Heather Love, we enthusiastically began a campaign to create the Ricochet CD. Back then, in the middle of Heather's brain injury, we raised $1200 here on IndieGoGo and pre-sales of that much again, which we used to record acoustic gems like “Sidestep”, ""Troubled"" and “I Fell"". We were able to pay some wonderful studio musicians as well as the studio/engineer as we put a marker in the ground for “Ricochet 2011”. If you are one of the friends and fans who helped with those early steps toward Ricochet, your CDs are still coming with our thanks for your patience!  I wonder what that original CD would have sounded like... Clearly, the CD that we now have brewing at Pied Piper Productions would not exist if it weren't for the past few years of “growth opportunities” as life has spun us into the Us that is now creating the most beautiful music of my life. 

Suffices to say that this CD is extraordinary.
It's filled with deep light and a path through sorrow. It is
imagistic and powerful and tapestry-like. It's folky and funky, full
of beautiful harmonies and musical hooks that stick in your brain. I have never been more excited
about music than I am about the songs in this collection, superbly
captured, mixed and produced by Tim Britton of Pied Piper Productions. As part of the production team, PJ and I have brought many important ideas to the sonic table, yet Tim is the man who is up til 4 am, refining every little thing. He's been along for
the entire ride, stepping up this past fall and forging ahead, finishing “Ricochet” with the full knowledge that this project
has legs. Really nice gams. Mercury's wings to carry us into our fully supported lives.


The Goal and How We Scale It
Our goal amount of $8150 was chosen to allow us to get the discs made, musicians and studio paid, and the licensing framework laid: as a number that people could wrap their heads around.

Any funds sent through PayPal or other cash-in-hand options are immediately available to us to pay the players, studio, manufacturing, etc. And all of it will be input into this campaign page where the names, amounts, perks and timelines are organized and maintained. 
When we reach our goal of $8150, the platform fees here at IndieGoGo are only 4%. Yay! Were we to fall short of our goal, the fees would jump to 9%. Eeek! Needless to say, we are FIRED UP to meet our goal, encouraging our friends and fans to spread the word via Facebook and other social media sites, arts funding sources, and friends of heart music with soul.

At the end of our recent Winter Jaunt Tour on the fateful day of December 13th, sometime after midnight she stalled and would not be revived.  We had her towed a whopping 217 miles to our last show of tour and home to the rural high country of Southern Oregon.  With our upcoming spring tour on the horizon and dates booked, we reeled in the wake of necessity.  The newest addition to our entourage of vehicles is a 1997 Dodge Van.

The Tip united as a chain gang of Nashville's best Rock N Roll bands. This supergroup joined forces in the fall of 2013 and haven't looked back since. 
Faster, harder, louder, and tighter than anyone who has crossed their path, The Tip is on a mission to bring their music to the masses.
The band draws attention by simply stepping into a room, turning heads of curiosity as to what this dynamic cast of characters is up to. Late nights, hot licks and boundless energy are exactly what The Tip is made of. 
Rock N Roll hasn't gone anywhwere....it exists in the songs, the style, and the lives of The Tip. 
2014 was a tremendous year with The Tip touring with Hammered Satin and opening shows for the likes of Sebastian Bach. Now in 2015 it is time to take the next step....it's time to make a record.

<p>Cazfest was established by
Johnny &amp; Lesley Johnstone in 2008 in memory of their daughter Caroline
Johnstone (Caz), a healthy 17 year old student at Bishops Stortford High
School, who collapsed suddenly from an undiagnosed heart condition and despite
the prompt attendance of medical services, failed to regain consciousness and
sadly died a few days later. </p>
<p>Cazfest aims to prevent
tragedies like Caroline’s through providing free ECG screenings for young
people and increasing awareness of heart risk in the young through our regular
fundraising events. Over the past 5 years we have screened over 1,000
young people in Hertfordshire &amp;
Essex. While most people we screen are thankfully given the all clear, others

</div></div>","About our Charity:
Cazfest was established by
Johnny & Lesley Johnstone in 2008 in memory of their daughter Caroline
Johnstone (Caz), a healthy 17 year old student at Bishops Stortford High
School, who collapsed suddenly from an undiagnosed heart condition and despite
the prompt attendance of medical services, failed to regain consciousness and
sadly died a few days later. 
Cazfest aims to prevent
tragedies like Caroline’s through providing free ECG screenings for young
people and increasing awareness of heart risk in the young through our regular
fundraising events. Over the past 5 years we have screened over 1,000
young people in Hertfordshire &
Essex. While most people we screen are thankfully given the all clear, others
have issues identified which need treatment.  With your support we can
screen many more young people in Hertfordshire & Essex and save lives.What else can you do to help? Please share and shout about our campaign, there are lots of share tools you can use from here. Please do 'like' us on Facebook and 'Follow Us' on Twitter - all of the links are here.

</b></p><p>
</p><p>Thank you all for
being there over the last three years as I've taken the first timid
steps towards a dream I had all but forgotten. The community,
support, and inspiration I've found have been unbelievable, and I'm
grateful for every piece of encouragement, every gentle nudge and swift kick in the
butt, all of which have guided me in the direction of my passion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From taking the
first frightened step onto the open mic stage at Cafe Deux Soleils,
to writing the first songs I was actually proud of, from touring
around Western Canada, to busking through the seasons to make a
living on my own terms, music has shown me that I'm capable of much more
than I think. It has continually pushed me, and it has allowed me to connect deeply with people through the powerful alchemy that transforms struggle into
something universal and lasting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's taken me three
years to trust it. To admit to myself how much it matters to me, and
to prepare for the next challenge... Surrendering and committing myself
seriously to developing a career in music. Now, I am ready to
take the next step - recording my first full-length studio album. I
have put my heart and soul into this collection of songs, and I'm
thrilled to have some of the most talented musicians in Vancouver
working with me to bring them to life.
Joining me on the album will be <b>Kenton Loewen</b> (Dan Mangan and
Blacksmith, The Crackling), <b>Wynston Minckler</b> (Bocephus King, Tim Sars) and <b>Paul Pigat</b>, who
has played with the likes of Neko Case and Carolyn Mark. We will be
recording the album at Afterlife Studios, under the expert guidance
of <b>John Raham</b>, who has produced records by some of my favourite
artists, including The Be Good Tanyas and Dan Mangan. I could not be
more excited to work with these folks, and their talent and love of the songs has made them so much more than I ever thought they could be.<br/></p>In order to make this album as we envision it, to capture the music that has been such an important part of me these last few years, and to share it with the world, some serious financial support is needed. From recording and musicians' fees to mixing, mastering and pressing, there are significant costs involved (you'll find a detailed breakdown of the album budget below). You can play an important role in making this dream a reality, simply by pre-ordering the album, or by making a donation.<br/><br/>As a thank you for
your contribution, I have put together a selection of perks, ranging
from hand-written lyrics sheets and hand-knit items, to a private
house show or personalized song. You can find all the perks listed to the right. Please feel free to look them over and choose the one that appeals to you.<br/><br/>I invite you to share this campaign with your friends and family (via Facebook, email or good-old word of mouth). This would be a huge help. If you know someone who you think would connect with my music, or loves to support independent artists, please pass it along!<br/><br/>If you'd like to know more about the album, making a donation, or the perks available, please read the important information below.<br/><br/>Once again, thank you all for believing in me, for letting my music into your hearts, and for all of your support.<br/><br/>With much love,<br/>Joline<br/><br/><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1401576/files/20150421010351-the_creative_team.png?1429603431"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><b>Meet the friendly faces who are coming together to make this album happen<br/>(clockwise from top left)</b>.<br/></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1401610/files/20150421011459-team_photo_with_john_and_border.png?1429604099"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p><p><b>Wynston Minckler</b> - Bass guitar<br/><b>Paul Pigat</b> - Electric guitar<br/><b>Kenton Loewen</b> - Drums, co-producer<br/><b>John Raham</b> - Recording and mixing<br/><b>Joline Baylis</b> - Songwriter, vocals, guitar, co-producer<br/><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1401624/files/20150421012153-album_budget_breakdown.png?1429604513"" src="""" style=""width: 620px; height: 111px;""/></p><p><b>Here is a breakdown of how your generous donations will be spent:</b></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1401625/files/20150421012232-album_cost_breakdown_2.jpg?1429604552"" src="""" style=""""/></p><b>Important</b> - This division applies to my fundraising goal of $12,000.

Thank you all for
being there over the last three years as I've taken the first timid
steps towards a dream I had all but forgotten. The community,
support, and inspiration I've found have been unbelievable, and I'm
grateful for every piece of encouragement, every gentle nudge and swift kick in the
butt, all of which have guided me in the direction of my passion.

From taking the
first frightened step onto the open mic stage at Cafe Deux Soleils,
to writing the first songs I was actually proud of, from touring
around Western Canada, to busking through the seasons to make a
living on my own terms, music has shown me that I'm capable of much more
than I think. It has continually pushed me, and it has allowed me to connect deeply with people through the powerful alchemy that transforms struggle into
something universal and lasting.

It's taken me three
years to trust it. To admit to myself how much it matters to me, and
to prepare for the next challenge... Surrendering and committing myself
seriously to developing a career in music. Now, I am ready to
take the next step - recording my first full-length studio album. I
have put my heart and soul into this collection of songs, and I'm
thrilled to have some of the most talented musicians in Vancouver
working with me to bring them to life.
Joining me on the album will be Kenton Loewen (Dan Mangan and
Blacksmith, The Crackling), Wynston Minckler (Bocephus King, Tim Sars) and Paul Pigat, who
has played with the likes of Neko Case and Carolyn Mark. We will be
recording the album at Afterlife Studios, under the expert guidance
of John Raham, who has produced records by some of my favourite
artists, including The Be Good Tanyas and Dan Mangan. I could not be
more excited to work with these folks, and their talent and love of the songs has made them so much more than I ever thought they could be.In order to make this album as we envision it, to capture the music that has been such an important part of me these last few years, and to share it with the world, some serious financial support is needed. From recording and musicians' fees to mixing, mastering and pressing, there are significant costs involved (you'll find a detailed breakdown of the album budget below). You can play an important role in making this dream a reality, simply by pre-ordering the album, or by making a donation.As a thank you for
your contribution, I have put together a selection of perks, ranging
from hand-written lyrics sheets and hand-knit items, to a private
house show or personalized song. You can find all the perks listed to the right. Please feel free to look them over and choose the one that appeals to you.I invite you to share this campaign with your friends and family (via Facebook, email or good-old word of mouth). This would be a huge help. If you know someone who you think would connect with my music, or loves to support independent artists, please pass it along!If you'd like to know more about the album, making a donation, or the perks available, please read the important information below.Once again, thank you all for believing in me, for letting my music into your hearts, and for all of your support.With much love,JolineMeet the friendly faces who are coming together to make this album happen(clockwise from top left).Wynston Minckler - Bass guitarPaul Pigat - Electric guitarKenton Loewen - Drums, co-producerJohn Raham - Recording and mixingJoline Baylis - Songwriter, vocals, guitar, co-producerHere is a breakdown of how your generous donations will be spent:Important - This division applies to my fundraising goal of $12,000.

There are lots of people that have never had a chance to experience this love. So through a project I found a way to put my passions together for a greater cause.</p>
<p>How? I gathered many Romanian Christian artists together to record an album that also shares their passion. It contains songs that display the reality of God's global perspective and the opportunity for us to participate in it. The album’s name is  ""Dincolo de Frontiere"" (Beyond Frontiers)</p>
<p>This project is off to a great start: recordings are in process, the first two concerts are already planned and interest is rapidly growing. For this effort to have an exponential impact, however, we need even more funding and support.</p>
<p>Here’s where you can help:</p>
<p>Cost for entire project: 3500 Euro (3,760 USD):</p>
<ul>
<li>three days (coordinating) meeting with artists 200 Euro (215 USD)</li>
<li>record and distribute 500 albums - 1,500 Euro (1,610 USD)</li>
<li>overhead for concert hall - 500 Euro (537 USD)</li>
<li>media production for the entire project - 350 Euro (376 USD)</li>

<li>promotional materials : 250 Euro (270 USD)</li>
<li>travel expenses: 350 Euro (376 USD)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Impact</b></p>
<p>We know that concerts come and go. From this one (and others to come), we desire to see his love move “Beyond Frontiers” to where it is seldom experienced.</p>

</h3> <p>My name is Pete Cannella. I am a local singer/ song writer/arranger in New Jersey trying to get my start as a professional recording artist. I got my start as a singer in Okinawa Japan. When I returned home I continued singing as a solo artist in the U.S. mostly in New Jersey, Delaware, and Pennsylvania. I have written quite a few songs but my equipment is not good enough for professional quality. I have raised enough for one track but I have 6 more to go to complete my EP album. People are really going to enjoy this. It's a breathe of fresh air from the same sound, same vibe and sets itself to a high standard. With your contributions I can make what I am out to pursue happen a lot faster. Once my EP is complete it is time for promotions. <br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>How You Can Help &amp; What You Get</h3> <ul> <li>All funding is transferred to my business paypal account that I use for selling merchandise and credit card payments for live performances. The funding then goes to WesMix Productions in Detroit Michigan owned by Kevin Wesley Williams. He will then take the charts I wrote and hire studio musicians to play and record their parts. Once finished it goes into mixing with my vocal tracks that I record in New Jersey and e-mail to Detroit. The price range for this is between $500 to $1100 per song. The last phase of recording is mastering. The mix track gets sent to Mastering House Inc in Pottstown Pennsylvania to Tom Volpicelli for a total of $75 per song. When all recordings are complete they go to Disc Hounds in West Chester PA to be packaged for a total of $700 for every 300 CD's. These songs will also be on I Tunes and sold digitally. The total project cost is anywhere from $5,000 to $10,000 dollars</li>
<li>If funds are left over they are kept in the business paypal account and will be used for the full length album LP. The songs I write will never end so the money will always go to production.<br/>
</li>
</ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <ul> <li>This project has much value to many people who love music. There are many people out there that want to hear a new sound with real instruments and a fresh new talent. The originality stays in the pocket of the norm to not get too abstract to where the audience doesn't get it. Most of the songs I write are about real life events. Some are happy, some sad but all great for the mind and soul.<br/>
</li> <li>Innovative new artists always catch the main stream if they catch the peoples attention. What catches their attention is a great rhythm/beat, melody, a great voice and themes they relate to. My facebook audience has always given me praise and loves my tracks. On my youtube account my videos are at a 98% like rate. I can't reach everyone but the people I do all like it. These are strangers 90% of the time so I know it's right.<br/>
</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<ul> <li>The risk is simple, the with all the talent and all the work I put into this, it still needs to be noticed by someone. I can promote myself and run campaigns for promotions but I still need to get a little lucky to be found. To me I don't lose out if I don't hit it big. My project is for my fans I have already and to continue expressing myself through music.<br/>
</li> <li>My plan for minimizing this list is getting together with promotional companies and agencies to help get my stuff out there. On my own I will also promote as much as I can and share to as many as possible. It's a matter of marketing and with the right methods in place I can increase my chances.<br/>

musician I grew passing through many different kind of music,  starting
 with classical music, experimenting with electronic music,  reaching a 
point of softness and firmness thanks to the meditation.<br/>After a period spent on a process of personal 
introspection and growth, I created a brand new musical project called

</div></div>","Hi, this is Massimo Kyo, musician, composer and a meditation facilitator
as I spent so many years in meditation communities where I trained.I'm born the 3rd october 1974 in Castellammare di Stabia, Naples. As  a 
musician I grew passing through many different kind of music,  starting
 with classical music, experimenting with electronic music,  reaching a 
point of softness and firmness thanks to the meditation.After a period spent on a process of personal 
introspection and growth, I created a brand new musical project called
 Music is Love. Here in tuscany  I have, with my family, a small home
meditation  center where once in a week we propose Mantra Yoga.
I'm also doing Mantra Yoga in many Yoga centers in Italy.



This Mantra Yoga or Mantra Chanting is a process that,
through songs and awareness techniques, leads us to a deep relaxation
and to the rediscovery of our harmony. 
Here a Video slideshow with images from the circles of Chanting and Meditation:


In April 2015 I released a first  Cd Sing a Mantra, which is a collection of Mantras played and recorded by me and many other talented musicians.And now I want to keep on doing that's why I'm working to the second volume of the album Sing a Mantra. Any Spiritual traditions use the chants as a moment of sharing, celebration and integration and I love to discover the most beautiful songs of different cultures. In this new episode I propose you Mantras with Millenium of History, Instrumental Songs for Meditation and much more..Many Artists collaborations will be working on the cd as in the first one.Your Support is very welcome and will be a  contribute to spread more light in this world. Please enjoy it NamastéThe jacket cd will be 4 panel foldable eco-wallets

</h3>
<div>Here is my story...<br/>I am a girl born in Serbia. I moved to Slovenia to study oboe at Music Academy, where I graduated from both artistic and pedagogic program. After that I've continued my studies in Vienna for one more year. <br/>Since than I have been teaching part-time in music school and for the rest of the time composing, practicing, performing... composing, practicing, performing <i>(you can find my CV in Image Gallery)</i>.... and all that on cracked instrument. When that oboe stopped playing I managed to borrow one used instrument 4 years ago and since than I had hard time saving money for a new one. But I did it, with concerts and a lot of hard work a got a brand new professional oboe and with that jewel I passed the audition for Berklee!!!</div>

<span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>And this is where my campaign begins.</b></span><br/>
</div>
<div>I have been accepted to Berklee Master's program Contemporary Performance with Production Concentration in Valencia Campus but I have used all of my funds for buying my own instrument, and the tuition fee is $41,100. I have already managed to cover half of the fee by winning the Berklee scholarship. Half more to go!</div>

<div>
<p>So here are <b>the numbers</b>:</p>
<p>Expences:<br/>$41,100 tuition fee<br/>$1,215 comprehensive fee<br/>- Required software bundle (the amount not announced yet) <br/>- Rent and living expenses for 10 months (min. 500e per month)<br/>- Indiegogo fee and conversion form USD to EUR fee (depends on collected amount)</p>
<p>What I got:<br/>$20,000 scholarship from Berklee</p>
<p> <i>To sum it up, the $25,000 are just to cover the tuition fee.</i></p>
<p>So, if we manage to exceed this amount, I will use the extra money to cover rent expenses and it will allow me to have more focus on my studies and less on working on monthly bases.<br/>But if we don't reach the goal, still every euro counts and helps. The tuition is to be paid in 3 payments, and with every payment I get to stay longer in school and develop more.</p>
</div>
<div>

</div></div>","Ella May Wiggins Memorial Committee


The Ella May Wiggins Memorial Committee was founded in 2011 with the purpose of establishing a memorial for Ella May.  The group became a nonprofit organization in 2014 and chose award-winning sculptor Steve Pi to construct a 5'6"" bronze statue of Ella.  Steve, like many when exposed to Ella May's story became passionate about paying tribute to this pioneer of social justice.
   Award-Winning Sculptor Steve Pi


Steve Pi donated the two foot clay mock up he constructed of Ella May. The mock up will be used as a model for the life-sized version of the statue.  The total for expenses involved in the construction and placement of the life-sized bronze statue are estimated between $80,000-$100,000.  Right now we are seeking the minimum amount required to begin construction of the life-sized statue, $10,000.  The statue will be placed in a prominent place in Gastonia, the epicenter of the 1929 Loray Mill Strike.  

    We the People Can Do It




The task of raising the full amount required for the statue is a daunting one.  The memorial committee will continue to pursue grant opportunities throughout this process.  However, we don't want the construction of Ella May's statue to halt.  $10,000 will keep the project moving.  Furthermore, it seems only fitting that working men and women, the working class, spearhead this cause.  

    Ella May-Martyr fighting for Social Justice
  
 Ella May was a textile worker, a union organizer, and a balladeer.  A pregnant Ella May was shot to death on her way to a Gastonia, NC union meeting in 1929.  She was the mother of nine.  Four of her children died due to her inability to feed them properly, or give them appropriate medical care.  She boldly spoke up publicly about her plight, and the plight of her black neighbors, the need for a living wage.  She sang heartfelt ballads and others were moved.  Her ability to make a difference, her promotion of social change, made her a target.  On September 14, 1929 Ella May was forever silenced, however with your help we will make sure that she will always be remembered.

We're a relatively new and unestablished label being headed up by two college students trying to turn it into a career, and the cost of album production, manufacturing, promotion and distribution ain't cheap. Some different aspects of the process include:</p> <ul> <li>Musical production (acquiring beats, recording, mixing, mastering, etc.), for which we have agreed to pay our producer $1,500</li>
<li>Artwork such as graphic design (approx. $600) and photoshoots (approx. $200)</li>
<li>Physical production and distribution for CDs (anywhere between $500-$1200) and, if fundraising goal is reached, vinyls (anywhere between $1500-$2500)</li>
<li>Marketing, ordering merchandise, and other miscellaneous costs (upwards of $1000)</li>
</ul>
<div>While the total costs illustrated here are higher than the fundraising goal covers, we are also working diligently to contribute to the project for the sake of individually funding as much of it as we can.</div>
<div>I'll also point out that the more support we get, the more able we are to make a high quality project. We both believe that this album will legitimately impact people in a positive way, and it certainly has the potential to change the hip-hop scene in Nashville.</div>
<h3>The Perks</h3>
<div>We want to treat this crowdfunding effort similarly to how we would treat preordering the album, with some modifications. That being said, here are the benefits to contrubuting (keep in mind that the ""INCLUDING"" segment only applies to one tier at a time, i.e. if you were to donate $50, it includes a reward at the $5 and $25 levels, but does not count the fact that the $25 level already includes the $5 level.):</div>
<div>-$5 will get you an FYC Sticker upon the release of the album.</div>
<div>-$10 will be considered a standard preorder of the album, meaning a physical copy of ""The Collection"" will be shipped to you on the day of the release. (INCLUDED: $5 perk)</div>
<div>-$25 towards our goal will get you a signed physical copy of ""The Collection"" delivered to your door along with our most recent release ""Butterfly Effect,"" shipped on August 26th. (INCLUDED: $5 perk)</div>
<div>-$50 gets you an exclusive signed ""The Collection"" poster. (INCLUDED: $5 and $25 perk)</div>
<div>-$100 earns you the privilege of taking as your own whatever item you want from the ""The Collection"" merchandise upon the album's release (t-shirts, hoodies, etc.). (PLUS the $5, $25, and $50 perk)</div>
<div>-$250 aka The Full Package: 3 (signed) albums, 1 (signed) poster, 2 pieces of merchandise and a special mention on our website and social media upon the completion of your donation. (INCLUDED: $5 perk)</div>
<div>-$500 gets your name in a special thank you on the inside flap of the album. (INCLUDED: $5 and $250 perk)</div>
<div>-$1000 (seriously, thank you) will be good for a personalized performance at your choosing, whatever your location may be. House party, birthday, youth group, work retreat, sporting event, etc. We don't care what it is, we will be there and we will be happy to perform. (INCLUDED: $5, $250, and $500 perks)</div>
<div>-Over $1200: Let's discuss potential returns on album sales, special artwork, or anything else you might want. This gift would be a real blessing.</div> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Since we released ""Butterfly Effect"" last November, we've seen an incredible response to our mission. People from church groups and dive bars alike have been excited about our music, and we are equally as excited to be able to share the best music we have to offer. Rap today has deviated from truth, and we want to bring it back. We want it to be about our collective story, about poetry, about what it means to be human. We believe that this album will have what it takes to spark a new movement in hip hop, and we are beyond ecstatic about the implications of being a part of that.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>FYC has some ambitious goals, and we recognize that. As it is, the biggest risk is that the money we need doesn't come in as soon as we would prefer, and album production has to be delayed. You can help this! Any donation is appreciated and will play a pivotal role in the release of this record.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>Spread the word!!! We have a plethora of social media outlets where people can hear our music and follow us as artists. Help share this project and some of our previous music and you could inspire more people to invest in the cause of meaningful and impactful hip-hop!</p>

</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Many of you have followed our progress over the last 5 years.  We have come a long way and could not have done it without your support.  Because of your faith in QandA and what we do, your contribution and support will get us to a level we only dreamed about just a few years back.  A little band from Houston, TX  growing to a regional and national player?   It seems hard to believe.  Thank you for believing!<br/></p>
<br/><h3>Risks and Challenges</h3>
</div><div> <p> </p>
<p>Of course, there are no guarantees in life.  The record might not be as good as we think it is.  The radio audiences might not like our music.  The promotion efforts might fall flat.  <br/></p>
<p>What we have done to overcome these challenges is to associate ourselves with proven players in the business.  Our producer, Ren Renfree, is a successful national touring musician with a record deal, chart success, and tremendous connections across the country with festivals and venues alike.  Ren takes very few projects each year, but he truly believes in QandA and in this project.  Additionally, we have his support after the recording is done and access to his contacts in all aspects of recording, booking, touring, and promotion.   With a great team behind us, we are confident that we will meet and exceed our goal.<br/></p> <ul></ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:</p> <ul> <li>We are asking all of you to please get the word out and make some noise about our campaign.</li> <li>Remember to use the Indiegogo share tools!</li> </ul> </div> <p><br/></p></div>","Left to right:  Andy Zipper, Jordi Baizan, Jose Verdugo, Dustin Wolfe

Of course, there are no guarantees in life.  The record might not be as good as we think it is.  The radio audiences might not like our music.  The promotion efforts might fall flat.  
What we have done to overcome these challenges is to associate ourselves with proven players in the business.  Our producer, Ren Renfree, is a successful national touring musician with a record deal, chart success, and tremendous connections across the country with festivals and venues alike.  Ren takes very few projects each year, but he truly believes in QandA and in this project.  Additionally, we have his support after the recording is done and access to his contacts in all aspects of recording, booking, touring, and promotion.   With a great team behind us, we are confident that we will meet and exceed our goal.    Other Ways You Can Help Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:  We are asking all of you to please get the word out and make some noise about our campaign.

<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">My sister asked me something.</span></p>
<p><i> ""You have more money then everyone, how the hell are you asking other people for money????""</i></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">It's a good question. A fair question. I certainly could max out my credit cards and pay for everything on my dream list. I could probably rent out a large club like House of Blues, and give the appearance of success.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">But that isn't what I am trying to do. I thought about how to answer my sister's question. My first thought was to call her a goober. But after more careful consideration, I realized that I am just testing the waters. I want to see if there is any interest in my type of thing.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Are people willing to spend a few bucks on what I have created? And this site seemed like the best way to find out.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">So there you have it. I don't really need everyone to buy private shows. In fact, just let me know and I will probably be thrilled to play one at your house. All I want to get out of this is to find out if I should jump in with both feet, or keep it like a stupid little hobby.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">So there you have it. That's the 'why'.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">I will share some links to my finished songs in the updates, so you can be the judge of what I'm putting out. And you can vote with your wallet.</span></p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3> <p>My name is Nick Carter. I started asking my parents for a drum set when I was 10 years old. By the age of 15 I had an electric guitar and a drum set. By the age of 17 I was playing bass guitar in a band.</p>
<p>I finished writing my first song at the age of 16, while sitting on my bed late one school night. I wrote my first love song at age 19.</p>
<p>I have been writing riffs for over two decades now. I have spent the last 3 years writing, refining, and recording my album. 14 songs. </p>
<p>I spent a lot of time on the road and had many successes with my previous projects. But they all were missing theatricality. Striving for more than just faithfully reproducing music and words on a stage. This year I started performing my songs in front of audiences, to very positive responses.</p>
<p>What started as a fun hobby now has legs. It has a beating heart. And I could not be more excited about the results. </p>

</div></div>","Start With The Hard Questions
My sister asked me something.
 ""You have more money then everyone, how the hell are you asking other people for money????""
It's a good question. A fair question. I certainly could max out my credit cards and pay for everything on my dream list. I could probably rent out a large club like House of Blues, and give the appearance of success.
But that isn't what I am trying to do. I thought about how to answer my sister's question. My first thought was to call her a goober. But after more careful consideration, I realized that I am just testing the waters. I want to see if there is any interest in my type of thing.
Are people willing to spend a few bucks on what I have created? And this site seemed like the best way to find out.
So there you have it. I don't really need everyone to buy private shows. In fact, just let me know and I will probably be thrilled to play one at your house. All I want to get out of this is to find out if I should jump in with both feet, or keep it like a stupid little hobby.
So there you have it. That's the 'why'.
I will share some links to my finished songs in the updates, so you can be the judge of what I'm putting out. And you can vote with your wallet.

Short Summary My name is Nick Carter. I started asking my parents for a drum set when I was 10 years old. By the age of 15 I had an electric guitar and a drum set. By the age of 17 I was playing bass guitar in a band.
I finished writing my first song at the age of 16, while sitting on my bed late one school night. I wrote my first love song at age 19.
I have been writing riffs for over two decades now. I have spent the last 3 years writing, refining, and recording my album. 14 songs. 
I spent a lot of time on the road and had many successes with my previous projects. But they all were missing theatricality. Striving for more than just faithfully reproducing music and words on a stage. This year I started performing my songs in front of audiences, to very positive responses.
What started as a fun hobby now has legs. It has a beating heart. And I could not be more excited about the results. 
I have what I need to finish the album. I am in the final stages of polishing the songs and recordings. I know that this is the digital age, and digital distribution is king. But I dream of something tangible. I would like to hold a CD in my hand. I would like to hold a record in my hand. Everyone can record an album on their phone now, and sell it digitally. I have bigger dreams. I want to fight bigger fights. I want to play all over the country, and physical merchandise is the think that makes it all possible.
Anyone can make an album. I want to take another shot at saving the world with my music. 
   What I Want I want to press some CD's. And if I make enough, I want to press vinyl records. There are some great PA systems made by Bose that are great for touring and playing house shows in living rooms and back yards. These are the sorts of things that will help me chase my dream for a little longer.
If I don't reach the goal, then the money will go towards whatever merch and CD's I can buy.

<p>Hi, we are ""One Love Soul""
a humanitarian project utilizing music, dance and expression as a fusion of

individuals united by love and our Ghanaian heritage. We plan to perform and
travel via land (as much as possible) in a camping van from France to
Australia, fly to the Americas and back to Europe. </p>
<p><b>Who we are</b></p>
<p>We wish to continue in our love for
promoting happiness and peace around the world. We are multicultural
Marcia (British, Ghanaian and Jamaican) and Michaël (French, Ghanaian and
Armenian) through our diversity we wish to contribute to humanity. Michaël
is a professional musician and teacher; he has studied traditional West African
music in Senegal, Mali, Ivory Coast and Ghana, as well as taking time to learn
in Morocco. Marcia has a first class bachelor degree in International
development and has worked for several years for an international women's

worker and performer having worked locally, nationally and
internationally. </p>
<p>We're taking on this ambitious
project as we wish to offer support to those most vulnerable, perform and learn
about all the different cultures musically as we make our journey. We plan to
learn the virtue of music and how it brings healing - music therapy is REAL! We
want to raise funds to enable us to buy and collect humanitarian supplies as we
plan to help different individuals and organisations such as orphanages -
children homes, homeless shelters and various charities. </p>

<p><b>Qui

<p>Nous voulons
persévérer et croître dans notre amour en encourageant et faisant la promotion
du bonheur et de la paix dans le monde. </p>
<p>Nous avons
des origines multiculturelles et souhaitons contribuer à l’humanité par notre
diversité. En effet, Marcia est anglaise, ghanéenne et jamaïcaine et Michaël
est français, ghanéen et arménien. Michaël est un musicien professionnel et un
éducateur. Il a étudié la musique traditionnelle d’Afrique de l’ouest au
Sénégal, au Mali, en Côte d’Ivoire et au Ghana et a aussi passé du temps à
apprendre au Maroc. Marcia a un diplôme de bachelor en Développement international
et a travaillé de nombreuses années en tant que responsable de la communication
et du plaidoyer pour une ONG internationale au service de la cause des droits
des femmes. Marcia est une travailleuse sociale et communautaire ainsi qu’une
artiste ayant œuvré aux niveaux local, national et international. </p>
<p>Nous nous
engageons dans ce projet ambitieux car nous souhaitons apporter notre aide aux
plus vulnérables et apprendre à connaître de nouvelles cultures musicales lors
de notre voyage. Nous planifions d’apprendre les vertus de la musique et ce
qu’elle peut apporter en bien-être, soin et apaisement – une véritable thérapie
par la musique est en effet possible! </p>
<p>Nous
souhaitons trouver des financements qui nous permettront d’acheter et de
collecter des fournitures humanitaires car nous planifions d’aider différents
individus et organisations tels que des orphelinats – foyers pour enfants,
refuges pour sans-abris et diverses organisations caritatives. </p>
<p><b>Où ira

<p>Nous sommes
en train de contacter différentes organisations sur notre itinéraire afin
d’identifier l’aide et le soutien adéquats par rapport aux besoins des
personnes. Nous offrirons aussi des spectacles gratuits avec instruments et
danse. Nous pensons que la musique a un pouvoir bénéfique, qu’elle peut
émouvoir les gens et apporter une réponse au stress dans les moments de
souffrance. </p>
<p>Nous
souhaitons documenter et partager les histoires et le quotidien de ceux que
nous rencontrerons lors de notre voyage en direction de l’Australie à travers
l’Europe de l’Est, le Moyen-Orient et l’Asie, puis de notre périple à travers
les Amériques. </p>
<p>Nous espérons
qu’en partageant ces récits sur le quotidien des personnes rencontrées, nous
apporterons un éclairage et une meilleure compréhension sur les difficultés et
les joies de l’humanité. Nous espérons aussi que cela contribuera à apporter
une impulsion positive dans la vie de ceux que nous rencontrerons. Nous
développerons donc un site web où nous partagerons nos expériences quotidiennes
à travers l’écriture, la photo et la vidéo. </p>
<p><i>« Confronter le Racisme »:
nous souhaitons faire une étude sur les mécompréhensions autour du concept de
race. Nous poserons les mêmes questions dans chaque pays où nous irons et
noterons les résultats détaillés. Nous espérons montrer les similarités et les différences
entre les cultures. Nous espérons que notre présence, en tant que deux
personnes mixtes, et nos sourires chaleureux ainsi que notre créativité et nos
spectacles permettront de commencer à soulever les barrières qui peuvent
exister. </i></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>L’Impact </b></p>
<p>Le
financement participatif (crowdfunding) est, pour nous, plus qu’un moyen de
collecter des fonds. Notre objectif principal est d’amener le pouvoir bénéfique
de la musique aux nouvelles personnes que nous rencontrerons et d’approfondir
les liens et notre engagement avec les communautés. Nous espérons que vos
« J’aime », « Partager», commentaires et dons soient un
véritable acte de participation à la communauté et d’approbation. Nous voulons
que vous fassiez partie de notre communauté. Et, à travers cela, nous vous
aiderons et vous nous aiderez. Nous grandirons ensemble. </p>

vous nous accordiez du temps. </span></p>
<p>Quel
que soit le montant de votre don, il sera véritablement apprécié et utilisé
pour contribuer à payer les coûts du projet « One Love Soul ». Si

apporterons un éclairage et une meilleure compréhension sur les difficultés et
les joies de l’humanité. Nous espérons aussi que cela contribuera à apporter
une impulsion positive dans la vie de ceux que nous rencontrerons. Nous
développerons donc un site web où nous partagerons nos expériences quotidiennes
à travers l’écriture, la photo et la vidéo. 
« Confronter le Racisme »:
nous souhaitons faire une étude sur les mécompréhensions autour du concept de
race. Nous poserons les mêmes questions dans chaque pays où nous irons et
noterons les résultats détaillés. Nous espérons montrer les similarités et les différences
entre les cultures. Nous espérons que notre présence, en tant que deux
personnes mixtes, et nos sourires chaleureux ainsi que notre créativité et nos
spectacles permettront de commencer à soulever les barrières qui peuvent
exister. 

L’Impact 
Le
financement participatif (crowdfunding) est, pour nous, plus qu’un moyen de
collecter des fonds. Notre objectif principal est d’amener le pouvoir bénéfique
de la musique aux nouvelles personnes que nous rencontrerons et d’approfondir
les liens et notre engagement avec les communautés. Nous espérons que vos
« J’aime », « Partager», commentaires et dons soient un
véritable acte de participation à la communauté et d’approbation. Nous voulons
que vous fassiez partie de notre communauté. Et, à travers cela, nous vous
aiderons et vous nous aiderez. Nous grandirons ensemble. 

Merci!

d’avoir pris le temps de regarder notre video et de lire notre histoire. Dans un monde où nous sommes constamment bombardés  de messages Facebook, Twitter, de pétitions

 Hola!

Somos “Una Amor Un Alma”, un proyecto humanitario que utiliza la música, la
dance y la expresión artística como una fusión de amor y sanación. Entregaremos
diferentes productos humanitarios para aquellos más necesitados y también
ofreceremos presentaciones de música original y en vivo con instrumentos y
danza. Somos M&M (Michaël Kormla Akortia and Marcia Banasko), dos seres
humanos unidos por el amor y nuestra herencia Ghanesa. Planificamos realizar
presentaciones artística y viajar por tierra (dentro de lo posible) en un auto
caravana desde Francia hasta Australia, luego volar a América del Sur y volver
a Europa.
Quiénes
somos
Deseamos continuar nuestro amor para promover
felicidad y paz alrededor del mundo. Somos multiculturales Marcia (inglesa,
ghanesa y jamaicana) y Michaël
(francés, ghanés y armenio) y a través de nuestra diversidad deseamos
contribuir a la humanidad. Michaël es un músico profesional y profesor, ha
estudiado música Tradicional del África del Oeste en Senegal, Mali, Costa de
Marfil y Ghana, como también pasó un tiempo aprendiendo en Marruecos. Marcia
tiene un Licenciatura en Desarrollo Internacional y ha trabajado por muchos años
en una ONG internacional de derechos de las mujeres como Oficial de
Comunicaciones y Abogacía. Ella es una trabajadora de proyectos comunitarios y
artista con experiencia laboral a nivel local, nacional e internacional. 
Nos aventuramos
en este ambicioso proyecto y deseamos ofrecer un apoyo a aquellos más
vulnerables, realizar presentaciones artísticas y aprender acerca de todas las
diferentes culturales a nivel musical, mientras realizamos nuestro viaje.
Planificamos aprender la virtud de la música y como entrega sanación – la
terapia musical es REAL! Queremos recaudar fondos para poder comprar y
recolectar productos humanitarios ya que planificamos ayudar a diferentes
personas y organizaciones como orfanatos – hogares de niños,  personas sin hogares y diferentes
organizaciones de beneficencia. 
Dónde
va tu dinero?
Sus donaciones ayudaran a cubrir los siguientes
gastos:
· 
Productos Humanitarios (ropa, zapatos, materiales escolares, libros,
comida, frazadas)
· 
Desarrollo Sitio Web
· 
Cámara Profesional

Entregaremos
diferentes productos humanitarios (ropa, zapatos, materiales escolares, libros,
comida, frazadas) para aquellos más necesitados (organizaciones de
beneficencia, hogares de niños, personas sin hogar, centro de refugiados, etc.)
Estamos contactando diferentes organizaciones en nuestra ruta, para identificar
que apoyo podemos ofrecer dependiendo de las necesidades de las personas.
También ofreceremos a las organizaciones presentaciones artísticas gratuitas de
música original con instrumentos y en vivo. Creemos que la música tiene una
energía de creación que puede mover a las personas y aliviar el estrés en
momentos de sufrimiento.
Viajando
a través de Europa del Este hacia el Medio Oriente, atravesando Asia, luego a
Australia y cruzar a América, deseamos documentar nuestro viaje y compartir las
historias de vida de las personas que reencontramos. Esperamos que al compartir
las realidades que las personas confrontan entregara una profunda comprensión
de las batallas y alegrías de la humanidad y además contribuir a un cambio
positivo en las vidas de las personas que reencontramos. Por lo tanto,
desarrollaremos un sitio web donde compartiremos nuestra experiencia diaria a
través de blogs, fotografías y videos.
Desafiando Racismo: Deseamos llevar a cabo
una encuesta que explorará las diferentes ideas erróneas sobre las razas.
Realizaremos las mismas preguntas en todos los países que visitaremos y
documentaremos los resultados. Esperamos demostrar las semejanzas y diferencia
entre cada cultura. Como dos mestizos esperamos que nuestra presencia,
historias de vidas y cariñosas sonrisas comenzaran a quebrar barreras a través
de nuestra creatividad y presentaciones artísticas. 
El Impacto
Para nosotros, crowdfunding
(Financiamiento colectivo), es algo más allá del dinero que recaudemos. Nuestro
objetivo final es entregar música sanadora a las personas que reencontremos alrededor
del mundo y profundizar la conexión y el compromiso con las comunidades que
reencontramos. Esperamos que  sus “me
gusta”, “compartir”, “comentarios” y donaciones serán un acto genuino de la
participación y validación comunitaria. Queremos que sean parte de nuestra
comunidad. Y a través de esto, nos ayudaran y los ayudaremos. Creceremos
juntos.

</p><p><b>Why Me - Why this Project? </b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Thank you so much for
visiting my page. My name is Justine Wahlin and I’m a songwriter from Sydney
Australia.</p>
<p>In the lead up to beginning this album and on
deciding to seek crowd funding I have pondered the question, “why should anyone
choose to help me?” This has led me to reflect on the many albums that I love,
how they have woven themselves among my memories, how they have enhanced the
landscape of so many of the special moments in my life and at certain times how
they have brought profound healing when nothing else could. </p>
<p>In 2012 I released 6 songs in a very stripped
back acoustic EP called “Conversations with Crows”. The feedback I’ve received
has been overwhelmingly positive and has reassured me that I’m not just playing music for myself but for
others who have found solace and joy in the songs I write. </p><p>My hope is that this will be an album you'll treasure as much as some of your favourites.<br/></p>
<p><b>The Album</b></p>
<p>""A Long Way From
Home” is my first full-length studio album.</p>
<p>My vision is for
these 10 carefully selected songs, is to bring them out with all the instrumentation
they crave and to create a textured full-colour landscape for each one. Additional parts and sounds will be played and created with the help and vision of the very talented Michael
Ward, Dylan Hartas and Glen Schollum. By the time the recordings are finished,
these songs will have indeed come a long way from their birthplaces and yet they
will hold fast to the thread that connects them to their roots. </p>
<p>I’ll be so proud to
bring you these songs in a professionally produced album that I hope will find
a place beside some of your most well worn soundtracks.</p>
<p><b>The
Numbers</b></p>
<p>The funding I’m seeking will cover only some of
the costs, which include; </p>
<p>- Studio time and
mixing $3,700 </p>
<p>- Mastering $1,500</p>
<p>- Studio Musicians
(Dylan, Michael and Glen) roughly $1,000</p>
<p>- Artwork, at this
stage unknown but about $400</p>
<p>- CD production
around $1,800 </p>
<p><b>How you can
help</b></p>
<p>There are many ways you can help and there is no
small act of kindness that is not deeply and sincerely appreciated.</p>
<p>You can:</p>
<p>·<span>

</h3>I'm Adam Hendey! I'd like to say that I'm a member of the rising generation of new Celtic musicians. I'm primarily a whistle player, but I also play guitar and bouzouki, bass, percussion, and some other fun things. Over the course of my journey through music, I've experimented playing jazz, classical, rock, hip hop, and other folk musics, but Celtic music has always been my home. <br/><br/>I have a serious interest in writing, performing, and studying Celtic music - both its traditions historically, as well as its status as an evolving, contemporary culture.<br/><br/>My first real step in pursuing this passion is producing this album.

</div> <div> <h3>My Goal<br/>
</h3>In order for this album to become a reality, I'm going to need $5000.

<p>Still, we are determined that this is a show worth doing - Verdi's last opera is quite possibly his greatest, and is a fantastic showcase for all the performers involved.

</h3> <p>My name is The Hyphenate and I'm a recording artist/producer who is passionate about making real hip hop and about making a difference. I make lyrical, thought-provoking, entertaining, and socially conscious music that both hardcore hip hop fans and young new enthusiasts equally enjoy. I also am very involved within the community and I utilize my influence and voice to advocate change and progress for a better tomorrow. I'm an independent artist; I produce my own beats, write my own lyrics, engineer my own songs, direct/edit/create my own videos/designs/photos/media content, and I'm continuously building a stronger and bigger support base. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Why This Is Important<br/>
</h3>
<p>This crowd funding campaign to help me finish my new album is extremely important to me for many reasons. I've done as much as I can on my own up to this point, but I need your help for this next step. My upcoming album Fighter is a personal and influential album filled with music that entertains but also connects with its listeners on a deeply emotional level. People relate to my music and are inspired by it. My mission is to use my music and my voice to make people feel good at the same time make them feel motivated enough to never give up on themselves despite what life brings. I'm also excited to use this album to give back by donating 10% of all profits from this album's sales to children's shelters across the nation. My support base has been growing and the demand for a professional studio album has gotten to a point where I have to give my amazing supporters what they want.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>How Your Contribution Will Help<br/>
</h3>
<p>Your contribution to this project, no matter the size, will be a HUGE help to my music career and movement. It is very hard for me as an independent artist to do everything and provide the resources to make an album with a proper release, but with your help, we can do incredible things with this project. Your donation will help with:</p>

<p>●Professionally Mastered ""Fighter"" Album</p>
<p>●Professionally Reproduced and Packaged Album</p>

<p>●Album Distribution to all Digital Stores (Including iTunes) </p>

<h3>What You Get<br/>

I'm independent but I do make music professionally and know how to make sure I deliver on a promise. If somehow all of the funds aren't raised, that doesn't mean the project will fail. I'm also personally investing into this project and I currently have my amazing publicist working on gathering sponsors and investors as well. Ideally I'd like to start off with having 1,000 physical copies of the album made and have an album release party at a venue that holds at least 500 guests, but if somehow we struggle with funding, then the album production and merchandise for all those who contributed will be fulfilled no matter what.

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><p>There is a fresh and innovative sound taking over the music
scene in the Queen city of Charlotte, NC and their name is Lovely Budz.  These young and determined musicians have set
out on a mission to provide a musical experience unmatched by any other
band.  Lovely Budz made their debut in
March 2014 officially but all of the band members have been playing music for
quite awhile.</p>
<p>Lovely Budz consists of Robert Samuel Tyler Vickery on Rhythm
guitar/Lead Vocals but Tyler can play any instrument.  He is very skilled on Tuba and Trombone to
mention a couple.  On Lead Guitar is
Mason Slocum.  He also can play the keys
as well as Tenor and Alto Saxophones.  On
Drums and anything percussion is Kody Farris. 
Tyler, Kody, and Mason have all been playing in marching and concert
ensembles since the 6<sup>th</sup> grade. 
The latest addition to the band is none other than Clifton Bundick on
Bass.  Clifton attends the University of
North Carolina at Charlotte and has been accepted to study the Jazz Bass by the
UNCC department of music. The bands home location is the “Lovely Lab” located
in Indian Land, SC.  When these four
musicians aren’t practicing or playing a show they are out in full support of
other local bands.  They spend most of
those shows soaking up the knowledge of other bands that have laid the
foundation before them and finding their own unique ways to contribute to the
ever growing music scene in the Charlotte area.</p>
<p>Some of the artists that have been huge influences on Lovely
Budz are Sun Dried Vibes, Zach Fowler, Treehouse, Rebelution, Of Good Nature,
Passafire, Young the Giant, Roots of a Rebellion, and Nahko and Medicine for
the People.  Lovely Budz has already
shared the stage with several of these bands at Chop Shop for the annual
Wintersplash and Give Thanks Festivals. 
There are big plans on the horizon as these guys are looking forward to
sharing the stage with more fantastic artists in the Charlotte area as well as
touring the southeast.  This tour will
cover a large area over the Carolinas, Tennessee, Georgia, and more.  Lovely Budz tries to play as many local shows
as possible while still juggling a rigorous school and extracurricular
schedule.</p>
<p>Before Lovely Budz embarks on their first tour they are
planning on recording their debut EP titled ""The Sound"" which will consist of hit singles and

scene in the Queen city of Charlotte, NC and their name is Lovely Budz.  These young and determined musicians have set
out on a mission to provide a musical experience unmatched by any other
band.  Lovely Budz made their debut in
March 2014 officially but all of the band members have been playing music for
quite awhile.
Lovely Budz consists of Robert Samuel Tyler Vickery on Rhythm
guitar/Lead Vocals but Tyler can play any instrument.  He is very skilled on Tuba and Trombone to
mention a couple.  On Lead Guitar is
Mason Slocum.  He also can play the keys
as well as Tenor and Alto Saxophones.  On
Drums and anything percussion is Kody Farris. 
Tyler, Kody, and Mason have all been playing in marching and concert
ensembles since the 6th grade. 
The latest addition to the band is none other than Clifton Bundick on
Bass.  Clifton attends the University of
North Carolina at Charlotte and has been accepted to study the Jazz Bass by the
UNCC department of music. The bands home location is the “Lovely Lab” located
in Indian Land, SC.  When these four
musicians aren’t practicing or playing a show they are out in full support of
other local bands.  They spend most of
those shows soaking up the knowledge of other bands that have laid the
foundation before them and finding their own unique ways to contribute to the
ever growing music scene in the Charlotte area.
Some of the artists that have been huge influences on Lovely
Budz are Sun Dried Vibes, Zach Fowler, Treehouse, Rebelution, Of Good Nature,
Passafire, Young the Giant, Roots of a Rebellion, and Nahko and Medicine for
the People.  Lovely Budz has already
shared the stage with several of these bands at Chop Shop for the annual
Wintersplash and Give Thanks Festivals. 
There are big plans on the horizon as these guys are looking forward to
sharing the stage with more fantastic artists in the Charlotte area as well as
touring the southeast.  This tour will
cover a large area over the Carolinas, Tennessee, Georgia, and more.  Lovely Budz tries to play as many local shows
as possible while still juggling a rigorous school and extracurricular
schedule.
Before Lovely Budz embarks on their first tour they are
planning on recording their debut EP titled ""The Sound"" which will consist of hit singles and
crowd favorites.  They also have an
impressive and affordable merchandise section to promote not only the band’s
name but their patented message “Circle of Love.”  As a child Tyler learned from his Great
Grandmother about how everyone in their family including close friends were all
in a circle of love and no one can break it.

I made a bee-line for the bass, big and curvy an beautiful, and when I heard the deep and echoing resonances that sang from its wooden body, I knew exactly what instrument I wanted to play.

<h3>Who is Elyse and What is <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/sadgirlpianomusic/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">#sadgirlpianomusic</a>?</h3>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Elyse got her start writing music very young</strong>, writing lyrics and singing her words to anyone who would listen. As a Midwestern teenager, Elyse spent her free time tucked away in chorus practice rooms building a relationship with the piano. At 15, she began writing original songs with simple 3 note chords on the piano to accompany her vocals, using music as an outlet to help her process teenage heartbreaks, issues with identity, and to celebrate her love of poetry. <strong>This was the beginning of <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/sadgirlpianomusic/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">#sadgirlpianomusic</a>. Putting emotion and honesty into song in a way that can be shared with all who hear it. </strong></p>
<p>All of that came to a halt just a few years later. <strong>Music is a vulnerable expression</strong>, and for a young girl just finding her voice, one piece of harsh criticism deflated her quickly. Soon she found herself selling her keyboard, abandoning her piano, and considering her love for creating music a thing of the past.</p>
<p>Over the next twelve years and spanning several moves and careers, Elyse's love for poetry and lyricism would lead her to publish 2 collections, <strong><a href=""http://a.co/37iMPaB"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>NUDITY</u></a></strong> and <a href=""http://a.co/75GvlTr"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong><u>Watermelon</u></strong> </a>by Fall 2016. Yet, even after pouring herself into words, still she felt a part of her was missing.</p>
<p>All that changed in 2017. With the state of the political and social climate, Elyse took to music once again as an outlet, soon finding that <strong>her passion for creating poetry into music had never left, but needed to be set free.</strong> Given a piano as a gift, she spends hours playing and writing each day. Passionate, determined, and inspired, and recognizing that everything happens for a reason, she saw that being given a piano once again meant she has something to share.</p>
<p>A lover of music of all kinds, she surrounds herself with musicians, gleaning their stories and their knowledge. While finding inspiration by attending shows and buying albums made by local artists, Elyse wrote the title track ""Afterlife"" to put into words the feeling of watching everyone around her live her dream while she stood in the crowd, wishing she could be a part of it. It was this song that was the breaking point. She decided that her first step is just to try. </p>
<p><i><strong>""To see what happens when I work my ass off doing something I'm passionate about.""</strong></i></p>
<p>The Afterlife EP is a 5 track extended play that is an introduction and<strong> an exploration into the heart of a woman unafraid to be vulnerable, raw, personal, and emotional.</strong> Varying in style but succinct in their simplicity and honest expression, each track on 'Afterlife' is a heart-wrenching, bittersweet lullaby for the tender nerves of any listener.

<h3>We all love Bluegrass!</h3>
<p>We love this music so much, don't we? Let's keep it going!</p>
<p>We are so thankful and blessed to have grown up just down the road from Doc Watson in Deep Gap, North Carolina where we all were raised playing and listening to bluegrass. We now spend our time practicing, writing, composing, and performing in hopes of continuing this long tradition of music that we are so honored to be a part of.</p>
<p>If you've seen us perform, or jammed with us, or been in a camp where we've taught, you know our passion for this music and our desire to keep it going. We all love bluegrass and we believe investing in our new album is investing in the future of bluegrass.</p>

<p>After nearly 4 years as a band and through the support of our fans over that time, we are proud of what we've been able to accomplish together with you! We don't have to tell you who we are because you know. </p>
<p>Three years ago you helped us represent bluegrass and the United States of America as the first band to play bluegrass at the United Nations world music festival in Argentina. Thank you!</p>
<p>A year and a half ago you helped us record our debut album that hit #9 on the Billboard Bluegrass album charts, every track got airplay, and it helped launch our band into a new level performance opportunities. Thank you! </p>
<p>Now it's time for us to take the next step and put out an album of original music, many of these songs/tunes you've heard in our shows, and we need your help to make it happen!</p>

<p>As a band we've done a lot through the support of our fans. Our debut album hit #9 on Billboard's Bluegrass album charts. We were selected as an IBMA Bluegrass Ramble band for 2017, marking us as an emerging bluegrass band with a sound geared toward the future of the genre. We've played MerleFest, Bristol Rhythm &amp; Roots, Remington Ryde, Bluegrass on the Plains just to name a few of the more than 100 shows we've played from New York to Missouri to Kentucky to Alabama to Pennsylvania to Tennessee to Virginia and throughout the Carolinas...and internationally in Argentina!</p>
<h3>Now that you know us, what can you do?</h3>
<p>In short, invest in our 2018 album. Times have changed. No longer do big record companies swoop in and fund emerging bands. People don't buy CDs like they used to, so even small record labels are asking bands to help foot the bill for the recording process. After recording, there are additional costs from mixing to mastering to mailings to rights to manufacturing to design to promotion. </p>
<p>Even though CD sales are down, it is still the industry standard for getting on air, getting booked, and for selling to fans at shows. It is still something we need to do, and want to do to keep the music moving forward. Sure people will stream it for free, but we still have to pay to make this wonderful music we all love called bluegrass!</p>
<p>We depend on those who believe in us and our mission to continue the bluegrass tradition. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We hope to pre-sell $12,000 in CDs and merchandise to fund the recording, production, and promotion of this 2018 album. Here's a rough breakdown of our budget:</p>
<ul>
<li>25% studio, mixing, mastering, producer</li>
<li>15% manufacturing</li>
<li>15% cost of perks for crowdfunding campaign</li>
<li>10% rights to record cover songs</li>
<li>10% design, cover, inside, art, photography for album and promotion</li>
<li>5% mailing to crowdfunding supporters, DJs, promoters</li>
<li>5% other fees, UPC codes, SoundScan, Nielsen, AirPlay Direct, atVenue, etc.</li>
<li>5% promotion, printing, one-sheets, etc.</li>
<li>5% cost hotel, food, gas to travel to studio for a week</li>
<li>5% to crowdfunding platform - Indiegogo </li>
</ul>
<p>Any funds raised above our goal will be used to distribute and promote single releases, record a video, and promote the album at industry conferences. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why Now?</h3>
<p>It's been a year and a half since we began our last recording project. It was extremely successful in putting us on the map by charting. Now it is time for us to move to the next level by putting our original work out there for the bluegrass world.</p>
<p>We hope to have this album out in the Spring of 2018. We've grown so much since recording our last album. We've added Casey to the band and we believe we are ready to take it to the next level!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

We love this music so much, don't we? Let's keep it going!
We are so thankful and blessed to have grown up just down the road from Doc Watson in Deep Gap, North Carolina where we all were raised playing and listening to bluegrass. We now spend our time practicing, writing, composing, and performing in hopes of continuing this long tradition of music that we are so honored to be a part of.
If you've seen us perform, or jammed with us, or been in a camp where we've taught, you know our passion for this music and our desire to keep it going. We all love bluegrass and we believe investing in our new album is investing in the future of bluegrass.

If you know us...
After nearly 4 years as a band and through the support of our fans over that time, we are proud of what we've been able to accomplish together with you! We don't have to tell you who we are because you know. 
Three years ago you helped us represent bluegrass and the United States of America as the first band to play bluegrass at the United Nations world music festival in Argentina. Thank you!
A year and a half ago you helped us record our debut album that hit #9 on the Billboard Bluegrass album charts, every track got airplay, and it helped launch our band into a new level performance opportunities. Thank you! 
Now it's time for us to take the next step and put out an album of original music, many of these songs/tunes you've heard in our shows, and we need your help to make it happen!

If you are new to the band...
Just briefly: nearly four years ago we started a musical journey that has grown into a passion that we want to make our future. Each young man in the band plans for a future in the industry.
15-year-old Liam Purcell sings and plays mandolin/fiddle/dobro: Liam is the youngest Wernick Method certified teacher ever, he teaches at camps, he writes lyrics and composes music, he is homeschooled, and wants to one day work in bluegrass playing, teaching, and working behind the scenes in a studio.
18-year-old Tray Wellington plays banjo: Tray is a student in the ETSU Bluegrass Program. You might recognize Tray from his 2-page spread in the 2017 Deering Banjos catalog. Tray has a passion for writing tunes and teaching banjo and hopes to make a career of music. 

20-year-old Eliot Smith plays bass: Eliot is studying to be a luthier with Joe Thrift at Surry County Community College. Eliot has built 5 violins/fiddles so far, a guitar, and is working on his second guitar and a bass. Eliot plans for a future performing and building instruments. 

20-year-old Casey Lewis plays guitar and sings: Casey is from Rocky Gap, Virginia. Casey writes lyrics and composes music. Casey graduated from Wytheville County Community College. Casey teaches in the JAM program as well as private lessons and hopes to make a career of playing and teaching music.

<h3>Hi this is David Garza aka Lynx Bigtooth Maple</h3>
<p>If you've seen me play and/or sing in Texas, Mexico, North Carolina or Maryland, I'm grateful.  I've honed my craft, made my poetry and am so ready to make this album.</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm originally from Maryland, raised from 12 years old on in Texas, and born in Washington D.C.  I started writing, singing and playing professionally about 20 years ago.  I'm moved by rhythmic guitar playing and poetic lyrics.  I like rhythm and I experiment with it often in both my guitar and my voice.   I've picked up influences from african, arabic, celtic and indian music while remaining true to my own vision.  </li>
<li>This campaign is the culmination of years of performing, honing my craft and developing my art.  I've been so moved by so many things in life and written about them.  I feel it's time to get some of the best songs down in a simple album.  The good thing is, I've created a lot of goodwill for myself in San Miguel de Allende, Mexico.  As a result, I have free recording time set up as well as donated cover art work and photography from my generous friends down there.  What I need is money to get down there and record.  And money to set up a website with Bandzoogle so I have place where you can download the album when it's done.  If I raise more than the amount that I need, I'll use it to bring in musicians that I know and trust to add more beauty to my songs. If I raise a lot more, I'll use it to get a nice van, hahahah.  (but really, I will)</li>
<li>I think the thing here is mainly that through synchronicity, hard work, goodwill and artistry, I have the opportunity to record a nice album for virtually nothing except the travel and website expense.  I'm grateful for that synchronicity in my life as well as the friends who've encouraged me along the way. In the perks section, I'll break down what each level of donation gets you.  I've kept it simple.  Thanks so much for your time, Lynx</li>
</ul>
</div><div><ul>
<li>Where the money is going:  1. Travel to and from San Miguel.  2. Set up of website.  3.  Bringing in musicians to record.  4.  Incidental studio fees.  5. A van ! (only if I exceed my limit significantly :) )  </li>
<li>What I already have:  1.  Free recording time in a friend's professional studio.  (He's the real deal and has recorded AC/DC, Air Supply, movies soundtracks and lot more for a very long time.  I'm lucky to be his friend.)  2.  Free artwork by a renowned watercolor artist who's amazing.  3.  Free photo artwork by a renowned veteran photo-journalist/art photographer formerly of a major city newspaper publication.  </li>
<li>If you've ever seen me play and sing, you know I go to another place and my hope is that you go there with me.  My rhythms are infectious and my voice is hypnotic, soothing and moving, or so I've been told numerous times.  I believe it because it still moves me so much, I can't imagine that others aren't moved too.  My approach was gained by studying and working through Julian Cameron's book, The Artist's Way, where I learned simply to get out of the way of the creative impulse and flow with it.   My song's are about beauty, women' rights, synchronistic moments, and of course, love.   Mingling my lyrics with my unique guitar playing style has created something I really enjoy performing.  I still love it to this day.  I've developed my own style, my own voice and my own poetry.  I'm sure you'll love it too.  </li>
<li>If I don't reach my donation goals, I'll use the money to set up the website, so when I record, I'll have a place you can get the album from. </li>
<li>What you get at each level.  10 to 25 dollars - a download of the completed album.  100 dollars and above - a download of the completed album and a ticket to one of my album release concerts.  I'll be doing them in both San Marcos, Texas and San Miguel de Allende, Mexico once the album is finished.  I have nice venues lined up in both places and can do more than one concert in each place to accommodate bigger crowds of supporters.   </li>
</ul></div><div>
<p> </p>
<p>One thing I'm really excited about is my Women's Trilogy, which are 3 songs that came to me about women's rights.  It's past due (about 10,000 years) for women to be at least 50% in charge of the world. </p>

<h3>What is Flood?</h3>
<p>I'm Claire Michelle, a musician in Seattle, WA and I want to release a flood of singles to raise awareness of transgender musicians, ""Enepec"" is the first of many.</p>
<p>I, like many trans people, have had to climb my way up from the bottom. When I was 21, I was kicked out of my parents home for my gender. I took it as an opportunity and drove to Seattle where I survived out of my car until I was able to find a place to crash. I've worked incredibly hard these last few years to get to where I am now, and I could really use your help to get to the next step.</p>
<p>When I was coming up here in Seattle, I was overlooked often and I know how hard it is for trans people to even make a dent in their careers; If they're an artist, it's even harder. I want to release so many singles and saturate the market so much that they can't ignore me. By bringing up my own awareness, I can in turn bring up other trans artists as well.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>It costs about $1000 to record a single, $100 to master it, and $400 to pay the members of my band.</p>

<p>To put it simply, without the amount I'm seeking I can't release the song. I'm not going to record anything half-fast as I want to represent myself in a polished way.

<p>Recording these songs is the most important thing to me right now, and I'm going to do it regardless of how long it takes. I'm dedicated and driven beyond belief and I want to create something so great that we as the trans community not only hear it, but feel it's presence reverberate.</p>
<p>It's difficult for me to describe any sort of challenge because the last 3 years of my life have been a challenge. Funding the release of this single will happen, even if I starve myself in the process. Perhaps the biggest risk anyone is facing here is a delayed release date.</p>
<p>I've kept every promise to my fans and I intend to keep them moving forward.</p>

</div></div>","What is Flood?
I'm Claire Michelle, a musician in Seattle, WA and I want to release a flood of singles to raise awareness of transgender musicians, ""Enepec"" is the first of many.
I, like many trans people, have had to climb my way up from the bottom. When I was 21, I was kicked out of my parents home for my gender. I took it as an opportunity and drove to Seattle where I survived out of my car until I was able to find a place to crash. I've worked incredibly hard these last few years to get to where I am now, and I could really use your help to get to the next step.
When I was coming up here in Seattle, I was overlooked often and I know how hard it is for trans people to even make a dent in their careers; If they're an artist, it's even harder. I want to release so many singles and saturate the market so much that they can't ignore me. By bringing up my own awareness, I can in turn bring up other trans artists as well.

What I Need & What You Get
It costs about $1000 to record a single, $100 to master it, and $400 to pay the members of my band.
As this the first of many IndieGoGo campaigns, by supporting me at the $15 tier you'll be receiving every single single from this era. That's right, every, single, single!
I've also been getting into live streaming quite a bit and I'd really like to share with you what's happening in the studio! The $30 tier will put you on ""the list"" and you'll see what it is we're recording, and when we're recording it!
If you're a die hard fan, I'd love to send you a physical copy of Flood once all the singles has been released! This may be a while, but no worries, I'll make up for it by printing your name on the cover for eternity! ETERNITY? Yea, that's like, forever.

The Impact
I strongly believe that we can't create an inclusive society for transgender people without social awareness. This single aims to change that. I wrote an Op-Ed specifically about this issue, I encourage you to read it and understand what we can accomplish for trans people by supporting arts.
A critical part of transgender equality is being overlooked. Social activism is being shrouded by political activism, and it’s setting up trans-integration for failure.
At 21, I was kicked out of my house. My step-mom told me shortly before she kicked me out I was setting myself up for a long and difficult life.
It’s clear to see why; my parents had no idea who trans people are. Nothing they saw on the news was positive. It was always about how trans people we’re fighting for rights and never finding equality and acceptance. When trans people finally win a fight, society quickly replaces it with another problem, and the media are on to cover that issue. Trans people are being ignored as capable members of society and are instead being covered for our problems and negative stereotypes.
We may have (arguably) removed the trans stereotype from entertainment media, but the hot political issues all focus on one thing: sex. I’m not talking about the act. I’m talking about biology.
Whether it’s in the bathroom or in the military, both issues come full circle to discuss genitalia and/or the act of transition. Trans people are once again being focused on because of our unique anatomy, while our human qualities are being ignored.
If we are to change the view of transgender people in our society, we must stop focusing on trans people for their transition. The solution to trans acceptance lies with the social activists. The solution to trans equality lies with the political activists.
We are currently focusing on the politics of trans people, and thus creating a lack of acceptance in our quest for social integration. The more we focus on the transitional related issues of trans people, the more the trans community will be treated as outcasts. Political activists ensure trans people are equal in right, while social activists ensure that people respect those rights.
Respect does not come from broadcasting hot issues. Respect comes from acceptance, and acceptance comes from empathy.
With empathy in trans people, we can start shifting the viewpoint of others to agree with a fight for equality. We can start rallying allies and creating an even bigger voice for trans rights.
Art and song help people empathize with the issues trans people are facing, and artistic social activists play a key role in finding empathy through the stories they share, the art they create, and the music they sing.
Social activism makes society aware of trans people in a positive light. By focusing on trans people for their individualism others can relate to trans people. Trans musicians tell stories of their hardships, the things they’ve had to endure and overcome. These stories are not exaggerated by a member of the media, they tell only what the artist has experienced and nothing more.
Songs about overcoming, mourning, love, and friendship are relatable to everyone. Music plays an incredibly important role as an auditory medium in that the listener can only take what they hear. Stereotypes can not exist if you are not aware that the artist playing on the radio is transgender.
With a lack of knowledge on gender, and stories told in a catchy, relatable way, trans musicians, have the ability to challenge the belief of bigotry. Social activists have the power to sway the viewpoint of an unaccepting society.
Yet we as both the media and the trans community are not giving power to those voices that can influence the trend for trans equality. I’m working hard to change that through my music.

Risks & Challenges
To put it simply, without the amount I'm seeking I can't release the song. I'm not going to record anything half-fast as I want to represent myself in a polished way. With that said, by raising only a partial amount I'm going to take the contributions and put them away until I can raise the rest on my own.

<h3><b>About the Icicles</b></h3>Hailing from Grand Rapids, Mich., the Icicles are a melodic indie pop ensemble fronted by singer/songwriter/guitarist Gretchen and her longtime musical partner, the ethereal keyboard alchemist Joleen Rumsey. Lead  guitarist Rebecca Rodriguez, who joined for 2007’s Arrivals and Departures, offers an increasingly emphatic reverb-drenched counterpoint to Joleen’s spaced-out sounds. The band was joined on Renegade Parade by a new rhythm section — Zane DeVault and Aaron Ekins (making it a family affair — Zane is Gretchen’s hubby and Aaron is her brother-in-law).<p></p>
<p>With a new lineup solidified, the Icicles embarked on a period of breakneck creativity, recording Renegade Parade released in 2012. And even with the higher mope factor, the  Icicles did not abandon the spoonful of sugar approach to the bad things in life. As the music turned darker and examined more adult themes, the sounds became more lush and beautiful, at that knife edge where beauty and sadness are joined. The band sounds less self-consciously retro and more au courant.</p>
<p>The Icicles were founded by college pals Gretchen DeVault and Joleen Rumsey (along with original drummer Korrie Ottenwess) in 1999. Following 2001’s Pure Sugar EP, bassist Emily Krueger joined the group. By the time of 2004’s  A Hundred Patterns, founding drummer put away her vintage Rogers drum kit and was replaced by Greg Krupp. That album’s big single “Sugar Sweet” was picked up by Motorola in an international cell phone commercial. That was the Icicles’ first flirtation with the big time.</p>
<p>Next up was 2007’s Arrivals and Departures, which features “La Ti Da” — a tenacious earworm that was used by Target in the mega-retailer’s “Feel the Happy” campaign.</p>
<p>As the Icicles enter their second decade of existence, the group remains a vital creative force. “Just need a space, a place where I can clear my head,” Gretchen sings on “Would You Know.” As the heebie jeebies of adulthood creep up, that space of clarity is still found most easily inside the music.</p>

In our short five-year-existence we have released three records, three full production music videos, quit our day jobs and toured the United States for the last two years building up an amazing fan base.  </p><br/><p>And now, we’re taking a leap we once only imagined:</p><br/><p>We’re going to Europe!</p><br/><p>We are thrilled to announce that we are teaming up with TJ Concerts and heading overseas.  We’ll be focusing on the Netherlands, Scandinavia, Germany and the UK, and will be overseas for just shy of a month, from mid October to mid November. </p><br/><p>This is the big break we’ve been working toward for so long -  but we need to physically GET THERE and with your help, anything is possible. </p><br/><p>We are asking for $3,000 to help cover the cost of our round trip plane tickets (because we’re totally coming back… maybe  ;). If we surpass our goal,  we will use the additional funds to cover car and drum kit rental, and to stock up on merchandise before we leave.  </p><br/><p>To entice you, we’re offering downloads of our new, previously unreleased tracks; postcards and gifties from overseas, and (if that wasn’t enough) a song written all about you.  Oh yeah. </p><br/><p>If we do not hit the full $3,000 we will still put the money toward our plane tickets.

In our short five-year-existence we have released three records, three full production music videos, quit our day jobs and toured the United States for the last two years building up an amazing fan base.  And now, we’re taking a leap we once only imagined:We’re going to Europe!We are thrilled to announce that we are teaming up with TJ Concerts and heading overseas.  We’ll be focusing on the Netherlands, Scandinavia, Germany and the UK, and will be overseas for just shy of a month, from mid October to mid November. This is the big break we’ve been working toward for so long -  but we need to physically GET THERE and with your help, anything is possible. We are asking for $3,000 to help cover the cost of our round trip plane tickets (because we’re totally coming back… maybe  ;). If we surpass our goal,  we will use the additional funds to cover car and drum kit rental, and to stock up on merchandise before we leave.  To entice you, we’re offering downloads of our new, previously unreleased tracks; postcards and gifties from overseas, and (if that wasn’t enough) a song written all about you.  Oh yeah. If we do not hit the full $3,000 we will still put the money toward our plane tickets.

<p>Infinite Sound will also reintroduce a sense of community into the process of discovering new music, and build the community in a way which helps artists find new fans, and provide an incentive to these new fans to tell all their friends about their new discoveries (and not give them away). We want to make the buying process engaging and fun, rather than just another point 'n' click online shopping exercise. To help this process the fans will be financially incentivised by the site to spread the word about the music they love.</p>

<p>Infinite Sound will be an internet music hub that will provide a solution
to the issues that the independent music label, or musician, face when trying
to sell their music for a fair price and stay in touch with, and increase,
their fan base. It also aims to address the fact that the process of
discovering and buying music is not engaging for the consumer. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Streaming may be touted as being king, but it is unfair on those that
provide the music, and also unpopular with a small, but still significant,
proportion of the music buying public, who want to own music in a high quality
format and support those that make it. We also believe that computer algorithms
are no way to recommend music, and that a good old-fashioned human
recommendation is far superior. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>The website will allow
Labels/Musicians to:</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Sell their music directly to the consumer,
     with no need for them to use aggregators or other digital distributors,
     while setting their own price for it. The consumer will know that 100% of
     this price will be received by the Label/Musician.</li>
<li>Choose the genre of music they wish to
     sell under, as well as tag their releases with their own sub-genres.</li>
<li>Upload samples of their music that they
     choose.</li>
<li>Have access to real time sales
     information, and draw down their sales money as and when they want to.</li>
<li>Build a network of fans they can
     communicate with directly and interact with in the way they would on
     facebook, but this time being guaranteed that all their followers would
     see their updates. So all the people following them will hear their gig news, or that they have a new release, for example.</li>
<li>Not have to worry that they are up against people who buy followers, or plays, as the only stats the site will use will be based on sales.</li>
<li>Not have to worry about the new European
     Union VAT regulations which are targeted at music downloads. Infinite
     Sound will collect the appropriate VAT on each sale and deal with it in

<li>Users will have different classes,

</p>
<p>We very much believe that this model will result in much

integral to the creation of this art.</p>

</p>
<p>The challenge is to get the word out to enough people so
that we get the critical mass we need to make the site work. The business model
makes economic sense for those making and releasing the music only if the site

<p>Prima edizione di <b>MONINGA OPEN AIR</b>, due giornate di live, arti e performance che</p>
<p>racchiudono, nella splendida cornice di Villa Benvenuti, dimora storica con ampio parco,</p>
<p>una serie di appuntamenti con la musica indipendente italiana e non solo, impegnata a</p>
<p><b>raccogliere fondi per l’ospedale pediatrico di Kimbondo.</b></p>Si parte con una line up internazionale, capitanata da <b>His Clancyness</b>, ovvero <b>Jonathan Clancy</b>, ragazzo di Ottawa da anni di casa a Bologna. La sua musica è stata definita dream pop, un viaggio veloce attraverso 50 anni di western pop, kraut e cultura psych. Il singolo<b> Summer Majestic</b>, tradotto in immagini dal videomaker Jamie Harley, è stato scelto dalla rivista Rolling Stone come uno dei migliori della stagione passata. Calcherà il palco anche <b>Drink To Me</b>, band di Ivrea tra le più quotate della scena italiana grazie al suo elettro-pop brillante , che presenterà il nuovo album, Bright White Light, uscito ad ottobre per 42 Records. A seguire <b>Wolther Goes Stranger</b> il progetto solista di Luca Mazzieri (già A Classic Education) ora assieme a Massimo ""Colla"", Linda ""Bru"" e Stefano Cristi. Dopo il primo disco, ""Love Can't Talk"", sulla scia comune di un sorprendente cantautorato dance, è appena uscito, ""II"", ideale per ballare, sudare e amare.<br/>
</div><div>
<p>Tra gli ospiti anche <b>Altre di B</b>, una delle realtà più belle e curiose che si sta affermando sotto le Due Torri di Bologna, cinque ragazzi che in pochi anni hanno sviluppato una resistenza da maratoneti, una forza da scalatori, una follia di fondo da combinata nordica: hanno vinto un numero sterminato di concorsi, hanno suonato in America, all'Ypsigrock e allo Sziget, hanno condiviso il palco con chiunque, dai Marta Sui Tubi a Patti Pravo, da Stephen Malkmus a Of Montreal, non disdegnando anche qualche sagra dell'asparago.</p>
<p>Direttamente da Bucarest, un duo amante delle performance sperimentali ed eccentriche, i <b>Karpov not Kasparov</b>. Il duo è nato nel 2009, come una partita di scacchi musicale tra synths e drums, viaggia costantemente tra i ritmi dance di Berlino e le pizzicate classiche di Vienna, passando per le sonorità orientali dell’est Europa, confezionando tracce sofisticate e mai banali.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Nelle line up delle serate anche l’ambient di Harptical e il danzereccio sound di Socialite, direttamente da Milano. Dalla periferia urbana di Modena, due realtà musicali differenti per astrazione sonora e intenti, Lo Twinz e Piet Row.</p>
<p><b>LINE UP 18/07: WOLTHER GOES STRANGER, ALTRE DI B, HARPTICAL, KARPOV NOT KASPAROV, SOCIALITE<br/></b><b>LINE UP 19/07: HIS CLANCYNESS, DRINK TO ME, INUDE, PIET ROW, LO TWINZ.</b></p>

<p>Moninga, che in lingala significa amico, è un’associazione di volontariato nata a Formigine nel 2015, si ispira a principi laici di civiltà e di educazione delle nuove generazione. Lo scopo sociale dell’associazione è il finanziamento della Fondazione Pediatrica di Kimbondo, un’ospedale pediatrico ed orfanotrofio situato nella periferia di Kinshasa, capitale della Repubblica Democratica del Congo. La Pediatria, costituita alla fine degli anni ’80 dalla dott.ssa Laura Perna come dispensario medico, ha accolto nel corso degli</p>
<p>anni migliaia di bambini. Per i piccoli abbandonati, malati e con disabilità, la Pediatria costituisce tuttora une delle uniche opportunità di vita in un contesto di gravissima povertà come quello congolese. L’orfanotrofio accoglie attualmente circa 800 bambini e l’ospedale è l’unico gratuito nell’arco di centinaia di kilometri.</p>

Prima edizione di MONINGA OPEN AIR, due giornate di live, arti e performance che
racchiudono, nella splendida cornice di Villa Benvenuti, dimora storica con ampio parco,
una serie di appuntamenti con la musica indipendente italiana e non solo, impegnata a
raccogliere fondi per l’ospedale pediatrico di Kimbondo.Si parte con una line up internazionale, capitanata da His Clancyness, ovvero Jonathan Clancy, ragazzo di Ottawa da anni di casa a Bologna. La sua musica è stata definita dream pop, un viaggio veloce attraverso 50 anni di western pop, kraut e cultura psych. Il singolo Summer Majestic, tradotto in immagini dal videomaker Jamie Harley, è stato scelto dalla rivista Rolling Stone come uno dei migliori della stagione passata. Calcherà il palco anche Drink To Me, band di Ivrea tra le più quotate della scena italiana grazie al suo elettro-pop brillante , che presenterà il nuovo album, Bright White Light, uscito ad ottobre per 42 Records. A seguire Wolther Goes Stranger il progetto solista di Luca Mazzieri (già A Classic Education) ora assieme a Massimo ""Colla"", Linda ""Bru"" e Stefano Cristi. Dopo il primo disco, ""Love Can't Talk"", sulla scia comune di un sorprendente cantautorato dance, è appena uscito, ""II"", ideale per ballare, sudare e amare.

Tra gli ospiti anche Altre di B, una delle realtà più belle e curiose che si sta affermando sotto le Due Torri di Bologna, cinque ragazzi che in pochi anni hanno sviluppato una resistenza da maratoneti, una forza da scalatori, una follia di fondo da combinata nordica: hanno vinto un numero sterminato di concorsi, hanno suonato in America, all'Ypsigrock e allo Sziget, hanno condiviso il palco con chiunque, dai Marta Sui Tubi a Patti Pravo, da Stephen Malkmus a Of Montreal, non disdegnando anche qualche sagra dell'asparago.
Direttamente da Bucarest, un duo amante delle performance sperimentali ed eccentriche, i Karpov not Kasparov. Il duo è nato nel 2009, come una partita di scacchi musicale tra synths e drums, viaggia costantemente tra i ritmi dance di Berlino e le pizzicate classiche di Vienna, passando per le sonorità orientali dell’est Europa, confezionando tracce sofisticate e mai banali.

Nelle line up delle serate anche l’ambient di Harptical e il danzereccio sound di Socialite, direttamente da Milano. Dalla periferia urbana di Modena, due realtà musicali differenti per astrazione sonora e intenti, Lo Twinz e Piet Row.
LINE UP 18/07: WOLTHER GOES STRANGER, ALTRE DI B, HARPTICAL, KARPOV NOT KASPAROV, SOCIALITELINE UP 19/07: HIS CLANCYNESS, DRINK TO ME, INUDE, PIET ROW, LO TWINZ.

Moninga, che in lingala significa amico, è un’associazione di volontariato nata a Formigine nel 2015, si ispira a principi laici di civiltà e di educazione delle nuove generazione. Lo scopo sociale dell’associazione è il finanziamento della Fondazione Pediatrica di Kimbondo, un’ospedale pediatrico ed orfanotrofio situato nella periferia di Kinshasa, capitale della Repubblica Democratica del Congo. La Pediatria, costituita alla fine degli anni ’80 dalla dott.ssa Laura Perna come dispensario medico, ha accolto nel corso degli
anni migliaia di bambini. Per i piccoli abbandonati, malati e con disabilità, la Pediatria costituisce tuttora une delle uniche opportunità di vita in un contesto di gravissima povertà come quello congolese. L’orfanotrofio accoglie attualmente circa 800 bambini e l’ospedale è l’unico gratuito nell’arco di centinaia di kilometri.",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

Larger events and dances take place on board the Frigate Unicorn. <br/><br/>It is very much our ethos that the Wighton Collection and the Wighton Heritage Centre belong to the community and ticket prices and class fees are kept at a modest level to encourage wide participation.  Our students range in age from 6 to 79.  We also give workshops and performances in local schools, day centres, care homes and community centres.  Admission to our Lunchtime Recitals is free.  This event and our monthly Cappuccino Concert are very popular, particularly with those who for reasons of age, infirmity, transport or other reasons find it difficult to attend an evening concert.<br/><br/>In 2013, Friends of Wighton successfully bid at auction for 23 music books of the 18th, 19th and early 20th centuries which were in the personal collection of the late Sir Jimmy Shand, the world famous accordion player and band leader who lived and worked in Dundee for many years.  The books include a first edition of Niel Gow’s “A Collection of Strathspey Reels” c.1785 which is bound with several other collections of interest,  “Music for Harpsichord – Selection of Scottish Airs” with material by  Urbani and others, Balfour’s “Ancient Orkney Melodies” and an original “Gesto Collection”, as well as other items of musical and historical interest.  Possibly the most fascinating of all are several manuscript books from the Brechin area which date from the late 18th and early 19th Century.  These volumes of handwritten notation give a unique insight into the musical life of Angus at that time.<br/><br/><br/>Because of their age, and their varying histories, most of the books require conservation work before they can be made available for use by musicians and scholars and put on display in the Centre.<br/><br/>As conservation of each volume is completed we intend to celebrate by having, as appropriate, workshops and a concert, recital or dance based on its music and/or song.  <br/><br/>The venues will be mainly the Wighton Heritage Centre and Frigate Unicorn but others in Angus, Perthshire or Fife may be used where there is a strong local connection.  <br/><br/>The core group of artists will be the current Wighton Centre tutors, who include Gaelic singer Wilma Kennedy, Scots singers Amy Lord and Sheena Wellington, whistle player Helen Forbes, fiddle player Karen Hannah and historical harpist Simon Chadwick.  They will be augmented by our excellent local musicians including harpsichordist Mark Spalding, singer Barbara Dymock, piper Kyle Howie, accordionist Luke Brady and guitarist Paul Campbell and guest artists such as Sandy Brechin, Gavin Marwick and Bruce Davies, high profile performers renowned in their field and with a large following.<br/><br/>When the volumes have undergone conservation they will take their place in the Wighton Heritage Centre and be available for study and use by musicians and researchers as well as the community in general.<br/></p><p>We are asking you to help raise £5000. But this is just the start! The conservation alone will end up costing over £7000. But we are keen to get started with the work on the most fragile books, and get the concerts and events series up and running. We look forward to welcoming you as part of this great project!</p><p><i>Thanks to Kevin McGinley for making our video!</i><br/><br/><br/></p></div>","Jimmy Shand was world renowned as player, composer, band leader and

THE FULL STORY...A multi-disciplinary project to conserve and bring back to life the collection of  rare old Scottish music books from the collection of the late Sir Jimmy Shand,  preserving and presenting rarely heard treasures of old  Scottish music in live concerts and online.The purpose built Wighton Heritage Centre, in Leisure and Culture Dundee's Central Library, is home to the internationally important Wighton Collection of old Scottish music books, mostly dating from the 18th and early 19th centuries, which was left to the people of the city by merchant, musician and collector, Andrew James Wighton.  The Centre also houses other important music books and collections donated over the last 150 years.To preserve, protect, and raise awareness of this wonderful resource, the Friends of Wighton group was formed in 2006.  As well as having successfully raised funds to enable rarer parts of the Wighton Collection to be microfilmed, the group has brought the Collection to life through education and performance.  Monthly Lunchtime Recitals and Cappuccino Concerts are held in the acoustically excellent Centre, also the home for weekly classes in Scots song, Gaelic song, fiddle, whistle and clarsach. Larger events and dances take place on board the Frigate Unicorn. It is very much our ethos that the Wighton Collection and the Wighton Heritage Centre belong to the community and ticket prices and class fees are kept at a modest level to encourage wide participation.  Our students range in age from 6 to 79.  We also give workshops and performances in local schools, day centres, care homes and community centres.  Admission to our Lunchtime Recitals is free.  This event and our monthly Cappuccino Concert are very popular, particularly with those who for reasons of age, infirmity, transport or other reasons find it difficult to attend an evening concert.In 2013, Friends of Wighton successfully bid at auction for 23 music books of the 18th, 19th and early 20th centuries which were in the personal collection of the late Sir Jimmy Shand, the world famous accordion player and band leader who lived and worked in Dundee for many years.  The books include a first edition of Niel Gow’s “A Collection of Strathspey Reels” c.1785 which is bound with several other collections of interest,  “Music for Harpsichord – Selection of Scottish Airs” with material by  Urbani and others, Balfour’s “Ancient Orkney Melodies” and an original “Gesto Collection”, as well as other items of musical and historical interest.  Possibly the most fascinating of all are several manuscript books from the Brechin area which date from the late 18th and early 19th Century.  These volumes of handwritten notation give a unique insight into the musical life of Angus at that time.Because of their age, and their varying histories, most of the books require conservation work before they can be made available for use by musicians and scholars and put on display in the Centre.As conservation of each volume is completed we intend to celebrate by having, as appropriate, workshops and a concert, recital or dance based on its music and/or song.  The venues will be mainly the Wighton Heritage Centre and Frigate Unicorn but others in Angus, Perthshire or Fife may be used where there is a strong local connection.  The core group of artists will be the current Wighton Centre tutors, who include Gaelic singer Wilma Kennedy, Scots singers Amy Lord and Sheena Wellington, whistle player Helen Forbes, fiddle player Karen Hannah and historical harpist Simon Chadwick.  They will be augmented by our excellent local musicians including harpsichordist Mark Spalding, singer Barbara Dymock, piper Kyle Howie, accordionist Luke Brady and guitarist Paul Campbell and guest artists such as Sandy Brechin, Gavin Marwick and Bruce Davies, high profile performers renowned in their field and with a large following.When the volumes have undergone conservation they will take their place in the Wighton Heritage Centre and be available for study and use by musicians and researchers as well as the community in general.We are asking you to help raise £5000. But this is just the start! The conservation alone will end up costing over £7000. But we are keen to get started with the work on the most fragile books, and get the concerts and events series up and running. We look forward to welcoming you as part of this great project!Thanks to Kevin McGinley for making our video!",0.0,0,"4 Campaigns

<p>Hi everyone!<br/><br/>My name is Vasko Mladenov and I make music, mostly Rap and R'n'B.

You can listen to my previous album, called ""VNY3"" if you click on the link below:<br/><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjhAuimnLJmuL5-gHsWyMhZoZW4fIvAgB"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjhAuimn...</a></p>
<p>Since the life of a pro tennis player is hitting hard on one's wallet, I've been struggling to find money in order to record my album, and this is why I will need your help.</p>
<p><br/>Currently, my goal is to record my fourth studio album, which I believe will sound way better in terms of music and a few new things, which I have never done before will appear there, for example:<br/>1- recorded live instruments<br/>2- I will sing in many songs, other than rapping<br/>I am more than sure that a great quality product will be produced after the work is done<br/>In order to achieve this goal though, I need your help! Recording a full album will cost me $7000. This sum will cover all the studio expenses needed, such as vocal recording, arrangement enhancement, recording live instruments, mixing and mastering.<br/>In order to show my gratitude I will send special gifts and items, that have to do with the album to those of you, who help me fund this project. Also, I will be posting videos and live streams from the studio so you can see how the process is going and take part in it!<br/>Last, but not least, I promise you that the product will be top quality and I truly hope that you will be able to confirm my promise in the near future!</p>

<p>Меня зовут Васко Младенов, я пишу музыку и тексты песен как себе, так и на заказ. Начиная с 2009-го года издал 3 студийных альбома в стиле рэп и уже заканчиваю работу над четвёртым. Вы можете послушать мой свежий альбом под названием ""VNY3"" по этой ссылке:</p>

<p>Моя цель на данный момент – запись в марте моего четвёртого альбома, который, на мой взгляд, будет звучать намного богаче, интереснее и разнообразнее в плане музыки, а также ещё глубже и более замысловато в плане лирики. В процессе записи планирую две вещи, которых раньше не делал:</p>
<p>1) запись живых инструментов;</p>
<p>2) запись мелодичного вокала (местами буду петь).</p>
<p>Уверен, что продукт получится очень качественным не только в музыкальном, но и в литературном аспекте.</p>
<p>Как гласит известная русская поговорка, один в поле не воин. И это действительно так! Чтобы реализовать этот проект – запись альбома – мне также будет нужна помощь, ваша помощь. Ведь эти песни я записываю для ВАС, слушатели, для того, чтобы ВЫ смогли услышать то, что я хочу донести в своих песнях. Если бы я это делал только для себя, мне бы даже не нужно было ничего записывать.</p>
<p>Поэтому я обращаюсь к вам.</p>
<p>На полноценную запись альбома понадобится сумма в $7,000 до марта. В неё входит всё: обработка заранее написанных мною аранжировок в студии, запись живых инструментов и вокала, сведение и мастеринг.</p>
<p>В знак благодарности за вашу помощь я приготовил вам специальные подарки, которые каждый, кто помог этому проекту, получит от меня. Ниже вы сможете ознакомиться с этим подробно.</p>
<p>Кроме подарков, я буду скидывать в интернет видео и прямые трансляции из студии, чтобы вы смогли поучаствовать в процессе создания этого проекта комментариями и идеями!</p>
<p>Обещаю, что продукт получится отличным, и надеюсь, в ближайшем будущем вы сможете сами в этом убедиться!</p>

Through text and music as sound material: the choice of the German tongue as a philosophic language; in its sonority, the reference to the tradition of Lieder, a form where word and sound construct a system of meanings in search of the essential. Materializing it through sound, the works achieve this “concentration” of the essential, guided by the question of the “being.”</p><p>But, how do they achieve it? Long phrases, almost Gregorian rhythmicity, recuperate the capacity for enunciation born of medieval liturgical chant and Buddhist mantras. The concentration of power in the invoked words – to enunciate is to make real what is invoked. The essence is enunciated in the concept, in the construction of the enunciations that constitute the exoskeleton of these songs. The sound materializes the concept; it is sound that creates reality. The sound is in the center of the congealed hurricane. A person that asks the question of “being”, stops time. Their presence is now; only the now exists.

We live in the constant search for social acceptance, and our universe revolves around social networks. How can we talk about what is happening today in the world, if we do not know what is happening within us? We do not know our hearts, natures, and potential, and most of us are too afraid to confront our true selves. This work: Experiential and Indeterminate Songs, Op. 9 (Experimentelle und unbestimmte Lieder Op. 9) is a call to silence, to the exploration of our inner processes, and to the search for fullness.About the Concert:Our show will have two formats:1. Concerts:which will present the complete musical cycle Op. 9 (voice, piano, and synthesizer)2. Performance (Art + Music + Exhibition)The complete Cycle Op. 9, accompanied by the artwork of painter Maestro Jorge Posada. A captivating performance in an unconventional dark industrial site, where Ms. Hippert plunges us into an inner journey, while dialoguing in the darkness of the master's paintings.Whispers I (Oil on canvas 78x62 inches)Support our music and our performance:Please help us to bring this music and this message to different stages in NYC. We strongly believe that music is a powerful tool in the social transformation and with your donation, it will be possible to present this project in different venues and spaces. No matter the value, your donation will help our independent label IGM to continue its commitment to excellence, discourse, and support for new artists and new visionaries. Help us continue to promote new concert proposals, new artists, and new ideas.Below you will find detailed information about the music, the artists, the notes of the album by musicologist Susan Campos, and the relation of our work with the art of the painter Jorge Posada.Thank you very much for your attention and generosity.IGM teamCycle Op. 9 | Introduction by composer Julián de la Chica:Experimentelle und unbestimmte Lieder op. 9 Experiential and Indeterminate Songs, Op. 9 is a cycle for voice, piano, and synthesizer, inspired by reflections and experiences that I have had through the years, from which I began to consciously construct a spiritual interior life. I explore the sound of the interior voice that speaks to us in our daily intimacy, a voice that questions and challenges us. A voice that is conditioned by the world and its egos. The system.Distanced from a religious vision, apologetic and ascetic, I work with processes that in my personal opinion have helped me in attaining self-knowledge, acceptance, and finally, plenitude. It is a method based in the Buddhist meditation Vipassana, whose process of self-purification is realized through self-observation.I propose the search for individualism not from a moral egotist perspective, but from the perspective of becoming part of a collectivity that saturates and critiques us. We know ourselves, re-cognize ourselves, re-discover ourselves when we decide to live freely. This brings us to a deep and raw understanding of our misery. We walk completely alone in the darkness. In the coherence of consciousness, we define ourselves and evolve.  Exploring the silence, a theme that composer John Cage questions and proposes in his work, is a process that I feel is necessary and vital in our existence and creative experience. In accordance with this reflection, minimalism, as a musical proposal, brings me closer to this experience. Discovering who we are, deciding to accept ourselves, and live in the plenitude of the coherence of consciousness that governs our actions and words is an ideal in the daily process of survival. The cultivation of the spirit invites us to traverse an intimate path in solitude that brings us the fullness of interior peace, a state that should not be confused with “false comfort” or a harmonious appearance that is governed by sociological protocols or canons.The interior path, then, helps us to construct a global and objective vision of our being. It helps us in a concrete manner to endure situations and experiences, to never lose perspective, and in the final state, to experience peace, enjoyment, plenitude, including in the most vulnerable moments of our spirits, of our dark nights.  Jorge Posada and the Cycle Op. 9""I met Maestro Jorge Posada thanks to a great friend who bought one of his works.

<h3>Who Am I?</h3>
<p>My name is Josh Putnam, a Minnesota-born Oregonian, here in the beautiful Willamette Valley. I am recording a full length worship album filled with pictures of Jesus and moments that I hope will remind us of how real He is.</p>
<p>My passion is to see the people worship without holding back. Worship is simple, it's all about Him regardless of my feelings in the moment, He is always good. I want to see the church unite around the banner of Jesus and give Him praise. I believe this is the year of breakthrough. I believe we are entering a season where the lines that previously divided the church begin to fade. I believe the church will become ONE again and I believe that that will happen when we worship together. Jesus simply deserves the highest praise. Enough said!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>More About This Projects</h3>
<p>The costs to record a full length record are not insignificant. I will be recording for one month and the month after is dedicated to mixing and mastering. This costs about $10,000.</p>
<p>I'm also renting a venue in Portland, OR where I am having my CD release (July 2017) and a HUGE worship night (more about that in updates to come)! There will be about $5,000 dedicated to this event where I will be renting a public music venue, hiring a band, videographer and several other production costs. My goal is to fill this venue with believers from all different denominations to worship Jesus together and I am SO excited about this night.</p>
<p>If this project gets you excited or you feel inspired by some of the songs I'll be giving away throughout the campaign, please share what I'm doing on your favorite social media page, it helps so much!</p>
<p>Thank you to everyone who has helped me already, given me huge chunks of money (you know who you are), offered your help during the planning stages, and last but not least, brought an encouraging word as I step into what I know the Lord is calling me to do.</p>

<h3>The Project </h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Growing up in Huntly, I've been exposed to the singing of tradition bearers from a young age through competitive ballad singing. With a passion for folksong in all its forms, I aim to keep the songs of North East singers alive, but showcase them in a fresh and innovative way. I am a student of the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland and I perform in the North East vernacular, Doric.  </p></li>
<li>In 2016, I released a self-funded EP, <a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/east-ep/id1125928416"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>East</i></a> (I'm now poor!), played at lovely venues and had a trip out to Italy with my band. <strong>I plan to record my debut album this year and release it on the 16th January 2018. But because I'm a full time student, I am disqualified from applying to most art funds.</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<ul><li>I hope to fund the entire album to pay for <b>musicians, studio hire, production, mixing and mastering, design and artwork, duplication, licensing, PR, promotional materials, video </b>to name a few costs. It all adds up. Anything donated helps to make this happen! Albums are costly - £9000 is the minimum that they can be made for, but I'd like to raise as much as possible.</li></ul>

Growing up in Huntly, I've been exposed to the singing of tradition bearers from a young age through competitive ballad singing. With a passion for folksong in all its forms, I aim to keep the songs of North East singers alive, but showcase them in a fresh and innovative way. I am a student of the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland and I perform in the North East vernacular, Doric.  
In 2016, I released a self-funded EP, East (I'm now poor!), played at lovely venues and had a trip out to Italy with my band. I plan to record my debut album this year and release it on the 16th January 2018. But because I'm a full time student, I am disqualified from applying to most art funds.


I hope to fund the entire album to pay for musicians, studio hire, production, mixing and mastering, design and artwork, duplication, licensing, PR, promotional materials, video to name a few costs. It all adds up. Anything donated helps to make this happen! Albums are costly - £9000 is the minimum that they can be made for, but I'd like to raise as much as possible.

<h3>The Nuts and Bolts (more videos at the very bottom of the post</h3>
<p>We are SO pumped about our new album Satellite State! </p>
<ul>
<li>For those of you that don't know us, we're three friends (Andy Lehman, John Fahr, and John Pinkerton) that write and record music together.  We're from Greenville, SC, and even though the name on the album is ""Andy Lehman"", we are very much a band.  This is the 4th album I've put out, and it's easily my favorite. </li>
<li>If we can at the very least raise enough to pay off the fee for Mastering the album, which is still sitting on a credit card (non-interest bearing) we'd be thrilled.  </li>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Let's crunch the numbers:</p>

<li>Also..  This is the only place in the world to get a John Pinkerton Mug.  That alone is worth a contribution.  You get all of the albums I've ever made by supporting the John Pinkerton Package. </li>
<li>If we don't reach our entire goal, it's ok.  We will survive.   And the album will still hit the streaming services soon enough (recording artists like us make very little money on those, but we love them nonetheless).  </li>

Táncházakat, koncerteket, follkkocsmákat muzsikálunk, emellett van egy szabadegyetemünk és egy kultúrblogunk.

Ők hárman írják a pályázatokat, szervezik a szabadegyetemet, egyeztetik a fellépések technikai részeit, kezelik a honlapot és a Facebook oldalt, járnak a személyes tárgyalásokra, és további számos olyan apró, de fontos feladatot tartanak a kezükben, amire nem is gondolnál. Így érhető el az, hogy a Soós András vezette zenekar tagjainak csak a zenére kelljen figyelniük.<br/><br/>Működési költségekre (pályázatírás, honlap fenntartása, irodabérlés, hangszerek karbantartása, kiadványokkal kapcsolatos humán költségek, próbák költségei a parkolóórától a helyettesítők tiszteletdíjáig) nem, vagy csak nagyon ritkán lehet pályázni. Ugyanígy nem tudjuk pályázati vagy ""piaci"" úton biztosítani brácsásunk, Orsós Tamás útiköltségeit, aki Uraiújfalurúl, több, mint 200 km-ről jár a próbákra és a fellépésekre.  Ezeket a költségeket mindig a zenészek tiszteletdíjából kellett kigazdálkodnunk.<br/><br/>Most azonban három kiadvány anyagi fedezéséhez összesen még 3-4 millió forintot kell előteremtenünk fél év alatt pályázatok, és szponzorok megkeresése által, megfelelően előkészített anyagokkal felvértezve (amellett, hogy a négy kiadó, a Hagyományok Háza, a Gryllus, a Fonó és a Magyar Napló már így is sokat segített, és a források előteremtésében is együttműködünk velük).<br/><br/>Ezért fordulunk Hozzád: hogy biztosítani tudjuk a három kiadvánnyal kapcsolatos infrastrukturális és munkaerőt igénylő hátterünket.<br/><br/>Kampányunk abban az esetben is eléri a célját, ha a várt támogatások mégsem valósulnak meg maradéktalanul. Amennyiben a tervezett összegnél többet sikerül összegyűjtenünk, nemcsak a kiadványokkal kapcsolatban, hanem azon túl is, az eddigi bizonytalanság helyett tervezhetően tudjuk folytatni és gazdagítani tevékenységünket 2015-ben: A Youtube-csatornánkon rendszeresen jelentkezünk újabb és újabb népzenei összeállításokkal, a kultúrblogunkon portrésorozatot fogunk indítani adatközlő mesterekről és táncházzenészekről, és más rendszeres rovatokat indítunk, a szabadegyetemünket pedig közvetíteni fogjuk az interneten.<br/><br/>A támogatásodért cserébe postázzuk Neked a kiadványokat, feltüntetjük rajtuk és a honlapunkon a Nevedet a támogatók között, tiszteletjegyet adunk a koncertjeinkre, vagy akár tiszteletbeli tagja lehetsz a FolkEmbassy-nek.<br/><br/>Csatlakozz a csapatunkhoz, és legyél az elsők között, akik kipróbálják az első népzenei karaoke DVD-t!</div><div>ENG:</div><div>

<p>The FolkEmbassy
is a stringed, folk music ensemble, framed in the context of an informal,
institutionalized cultural diplomacy. The Ensemble has been active for two
years with the stated goal of representing Hungarian folk music, in Hungary and
throughout the world, in its most authentic and non stylized form, as a segment
and unique part of the broader European cultural landscape that is the
Carpathian Basin. The Ensemble plays at táncház parties, at concerts at folk
clubs, as well as providing a free university and a cultural blog. We also hold
interactive, knowledge based presentations and concerts here at home in Hungary
and abroad, in four languages.</p>
<p>For further
information please visit our <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/pages/Hungarian-FolkEmbassy/252667484783601?fref=ts"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Facebook page</a> and our <a href=""www.folkembassy.hu"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">homepage</a>.</p>
<p>This year we
released three publications:</p>
<p>-<span> 
</span>a multimedia,
folk music centred karaoke DVD (publisher: Gryllus - Hagyományok Háza) Mihály
Rosonczy-Kovács “The sun has risen in the sky” entitled selections (9 regions
150 folk songs)</p>
<p>-<span> 
</span>The folk music of
Báthory-Bem-Balatonboglár about the Polish-Hungarian friendship entitled
entitled album (publisher: Fonó)</p>
<p>-<span> 
</span>and in December,
the Kertem-FolkEmbassy Free University’s first three seasons’ summarized essay
volume. (publisher: Magyar Napló)</p>
<p>We would like to
ask for your financial support for our endeavours, more specifically, with
respect to our publications and the Táncház Free University.</p>
<p>What will we use
your donation for?</p>
<p>At the moment
there are three people working for the FolkEmbassy; Luca Szalai - assistant to
the manager, Lilla Mergl - foreign affairs and cultural desk and Misi
Rosonczy-Kovács, director. All three write tenders for grants, organize the
Free University, organize the technical aspects of the performances, manage the
homepage and the Facebook page, attend personal meetings, as well as countless
smaller, but just as important tasks, that one may not even think of. With this
arrangement we are able to ensure that András Soós, the leader of the music
group, is given every opportunity to exclusively concentrate on the artistic,
that is the musical part of the responsibilities.</p>
<p>Our operational
expenses, which encompass grant writing, homepage maintenance, office rental,
instrument maintenance, personnel costs with respect to our publications, costs
for practicing, from parking fees to paying for substitutes, can not usually be
recuperated through the process of writing grant applications. Likewise, we are
unable to ensure the money to cover our viola player’s, Tamás Orsos’,
transportation costs through the grant application process or through a market
solution either, instead we have always relied on covering these costs with the
money we are personally paid through the various concerts we perform.</p>
<p>At the moment we
are in need of 3-4 million HUF in order to cover the costs for 3 publications.
The timeline for the publications is 6 months, and we hope to close in on this
amount with the help of grants and sponsors, besides the fact that we are also
supported and helped by all four of our publishers the Hagyományok Háza,
Gryllus, Fonó and the Magyar Napló with finding sources for the raising of
funds.</p>
<p>This is why we
are turning to you, so we can ensure the infrastructure and manpower that such
a project demands.</p>
<p>Our campaign will
reach its stated goal, even if our expected donations do not entirely come to
fruition. If, however, on the other hand we are able to raise more funds, above
our stated goals, instead of uncertainty we will have stability in following up
on our projects with respect to our publications, but beyond that as well, and
there will be an opportunity to enrich and continue our pursuits in 2015.</p>
<p>We will
continuously upload and refresh our Youtube channel with newer and fresher folk
musical compositions. Our culture blog will continue with a portrait series of
our mentors from the village, táncház musicians, as well as other regular
columns. Our free university will be broadcast over the internet.</p>
<p>In exchange for
your support, we will send you our publications, and we will include your name
on our credit list, as well as on our homepage, as a supporter. You will also
receive a complimentary ticket to our concerts or perhaps you can also become
an honorary member of FolkEmbassy.</p>
<p>Join our team,
and be among the first to try the first ever Hungarian folk music karaoke DVD.</p>

""Csak az léphet elő világpolgárrá, aki egy nemzet polgára is"" (Kodály Zoltán)A FolkEmbassy - vonós népzenekar és köréje szerveződő informális kultúrdiplomáciai intézmény - két éve működik azzal a céllal, hogy Magyarországon és a világban képviselje az autentikus, feldolgozatlan magyar népzenét, az európai kultúra ezt a Kárpát-medencére bízott különleges és gazdag darabját. Táncházakat, koncerteket, follkkocsmákat muzsikálunk, emellett van egy szabadegyetemünk és egy kultúrblogunk. Négy nyelven tartunk interaktív ismeretterjesztő koncert-előadásokat itthon és külföldön.Minderről bővebben tájékozódhatsz a Facebook oldalunkon és a honlapunkon.Jegyezd elő most a megjelenő népzenei karaoke DVD-t, melyen közreműködik mások mellett Sebestyén Márta UNESCO Artist for Peace, Bognár Szilvia és a Soós András  (Junior Prima díj, Országos Prímásverseny Győztese) és Rosonczy-Kovács Mihály (Junio Prima díj, Le Femme 50 tehetség kiválasztott) vezette Hungarian FolkEmbassy.Idén három kiadványt jelentetünk meg; - egy multimédiás népzenei karaoke-DVD-t (kiadó: Gryllus - Hagyományok Háza) Rosonczy-Kovács Mihály ""Felsütött a nap az égre"" című válogatása alapján (9 tájegység 150 népdala)- a Báthory-Bem-Balatonboglár-népzenével a lengyel-magyar barátságról című albumunkat (kiadó: Fonó), decemberben pedig - a Kertem-FolkEmbassy Szabadegyetem első három évadját összefoglaló esszékötetet (kiadó: Magyar Napló)A Népzenei karaoke DVD közreműködői: Sebestyén Márta, Bognár Szilvia, Navratil Andrea, Tintér Gabriella, Dóra Áron, Mihó Attila, Szabó Zoltán, Agócs Gergely, Csizmadia Anna, Hetényi Milán, Juhász Réka, Kubinyi Júlia, Tallabille, Berka és a Hungarian FolkEmbassy – Magyar Népzenei NagykövetségSzeretnénk az együttműködésedet kérni a törekvéseinkhez, egész pontosan a kiadványok és a táncház-szabadegyetemünkkel kapcsolatos, pályázati úton nem fedezhető költségek előteremtéséhez.Mire fogjuk használni konkrétan a támogatásodat?Összesen három ember dolgozik a FolkEmbassy stábjában; Szalai Luca, ügyvezető asszisztens, Mergl Lilla külügyi- és kulturális referens és Rosonczy-Kovács Misi, a FolkEmbassy vezetője. Ők hárman írják a pályázatokat, szervezik a szabadegyetemet, egyeztetik a fellépések technikai részeit, kezelik a honlapot és a Facebook oldalt, járnak a személyes tárgyalásokra, és további számos olyan apró, de fontos feladatot tartanak a kezükben, amire nem is gondolnál. Így érhető el az, hogy a Soós András vezette zenekar tagjainak csak a zenére kelljen figyelniük.Működési költségekre (pályázatírás, honlap fenntartása, irodabérlés, hangszerek karbantartása, kiadványokkal kapcsolatos humán költségek, próbák költségei a parkolóórától a helyettesítők tiszteletdíjáig) nem, vagy csak nagyon ritkán lehet pályázni. Ugyanígy nem tudjuk pályázati vagy ""piaci"" úton biztosítani brácsásunk, Orsós Tamás útiköltségeit, aki Uraiújfalurúl, több, mint 200 km-ről jár a próbákra és a fellépésekre.  Ezeket a költségeket mindig a zenészek tiszteletdíjából kellett kigazdálkodnunk.Most azonban három kiadvány anyagi fedezéséhez összesen még 3-4 millió forintot kell előteremtenünk fél év alatt pályázatok, és szponzorok megkeresése által, megfelelően előkészített anyagokkal felvértezve (amellett, hogy a négy kiadó, a Hagyományok Háza, a Gryllus, a Fonó és a Magyar Napló már így is sokat segített, és a források előteremtésében is együttműködünk velük).Ezért fordulunk Hozzád: hogy biztosítani tudjuk a három kiadvánnyal kapcsolatos infrastrukturális és munkaerőt igénylő hátterünket.Kampányunk abban az esetben is eléri a célját, ha a várt támogatások mégsem valósulnak meg maradéktalanul. Amennyiben a tervezett összegnél többet sikerül összegyűjtenünk, nemcsak a kiadványokkal kapcsolatban, hanem azon túl is, az eddigi bizonytalanság helyett tervezhetően tudjuk folytatni és gazdagítani tevékenységünket 2015-ben: A Youtube-csatornánkon rendszeresen jelentkezünk újabb és újabb népzenei összeállításokkal, a kultúrblogunkon portrésorozatot fogunk indítani adatközlő mesterekről és táncházzenészekről, és más rendszeres rovatokat indítunk, a szabadegyetemünket pedig közvetíteni fogjuk az interneten.A támogatásodért cserébe postázzuk Neked a kiadványokat, feltüntetjük rajtuk és a honlapunkon a Nevedet a támogatók között, tiszteletjegyet adunk a koncertjeinkre, vagy akár tiszteletbeli tagja lehetsz a FolkEmbassy-nek.Csatlakozz a csapatunkhoz, és legyél az elsők között, akik kipróbálják az első népzenei karaoke DVD-t!ENG:
""You can
only be a citizen of the world if you are a citizen of your nation as
well"" 
(Kodály Zoltán)
The FolkEmbassy
is a stringed, folk music ensemble, framed in the context of an informal,
institutionalized cultural diplomacy. The Ensemble has been active for two
years with the stated goal of representing Hungarian folk music, in Hungary and
throughout the world, in its most authentic and non stylized form, as a segment
and unique part of the broader European cultural landscape that is the
Carpathian Basin. The Ensemble plays at táncház parties, at concerts at folk
clubs, as well as providing a free university and a cultural blog. We also hold
interactive, knowledge based presentations and concerts here at home in Hungary
and abroad, in four languages.
For further
information please visit our Facebook page and our homepage.
This year we
released three publications:
- 
a multimedia,
folk music centred karaoke DVD (publisher: Gryllus - Hagyományok Háza) Mihály
Rosonczy-Kovács “The sun has risen in the sky” entitled selections (9 regions
150 folk songs)
- 
The folk music of
Báthory-Bem-Balatonboglár about the Polish-Hungarian friendship entitled
entitled album (publisher: Fonó)
- 
and in December,
the Kertem-FolkEmbassy Free University’s first three seasons’ summarized essay
volume. (publisher: Magyar Napló)
We would like to
ask for your financial support for our endeavours, more specifically, with
respect to our publications and the Táncház Free University.
What will we use
your donation for?
At the moment
there are three people working for the FolkEmbassy; Luca Szalai - assistant to
the manager, Lilla Mergl - foreign affairs and cultural desk and Misi
Rosonczy-Kovács, director. All three write tenders for grants, organize the
Free University, organize the technical aspects of the performances, manage the
homepage and the Facebook page, attend personal meetings, as well as countless
smaller, but just as important tasks, that one may not even think of. With this
arrangement we are able to ensure that András Soós, the leader of the music
group, is given every opportunity to exclusively concentrate on the artistic,
that is the musical part of the responsibilities.
Our operational
expenses, which encompass grant writing, homepage maintenance, office rental,
instrument maintenance, personnel costs with respect to our publications, costs
for practicing, from parking fees to paying for substitutes, can not usually be
recuperated through the process of writing grant applications. Likewise, we are
unable to ensure the money to cover our viola player’s, Tamás Orsos’,
transportation costs through the grant application process or through a market
solution either, instead we have always relied on covering these costs with the
money we are personally paid through the various concerts we perform.
At the moment we
are in need of 3-4 million HUF in order to cover the costs for 3 publications.
The timeline for the publications is 6 months, and we hope to close in on this
amount with the help of grants and sponsors, besides the fact that we are also
supported and helped by all four of our publishers the Hagyományok Háza,
Gryllus, Fonó and the Magyar Napló with finding sources for the raising of
funds.
This is why we
are turning to you, so we can ensure the infrastructure and manpower that such
a project demands.
Our campaign will
reach its stated goal, even if our expected donations do not entirely come to
fruition. If, however, on the other hand we are able to raise more funds, above
our stated goals, instead of uncertainty we will have stability in following up
on our projects with respect to our publications, but beyond that as well, and
there will be an opportunity to enrich and continue our pursuits in 2015.
We will
continuously upload and refresh our Youtube channel with newer and fresher folk
musical compositions. Our culture blog will continue with a portrait series of
our mentors from the village, táncház musicians, as well as other regular
columns. Our free university will be broadcast over the internet.
In exchange for
your support, we will send you our publications, and we will include your name
on our credit list, as well as on our homepage, as a supporter. You will also
receive a complimentary ticket to our concerts or perhaps you can also become
an honorary member of FolkEmbassy.
Join our team,
and be among the first to try the first ever Hungarian folk music karaoke DVD.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>ABOUT THE FILM</h3>
<div>
<p>The resurgence of interest in accordion music  has  been occurring over the last 30-40 years.  Though many continue to see the it a<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">s the stodgy instrument of a bygone era - </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">and accordion jokes abound - it is time to set the record straight!

extraordinary virtuosity of the instrument and the music that it can make.  Touching on its deep history but focusing on the
present, the film offers
entertaining, conversational style interviews, anecdotal commentary and both
formal and informal music performances  from  celebrated accordionists,
composers and bands working and performing in America today. These primarily New York based but globe and US trotting musicians, make
up the colorful and thoughtful cast of characters who drive the story by
tracing their uniquely personal attractions to the instrument and sharing their
surprisingly divergent paths: from immigrant roots, Creole or Roma beginnings,
for example, to a recognition of the very special niche this so-called
""low art"" form provides for inspirations in jazz, classical, new
music, pop, fusion forms, operatic styles and beyond.</span></p>
<p>The film provides  a
tapestry of fascinating individuals, their attitudes, deep passions, and above
of all else, profound dedication to the instrument. We learn that though still
a rebellious lot, these music makers have an audience in some of the
hippest hide-a-ways and most sought after venues.  The film makes clear that the so-called
“accordion world” reaches far beyond the borders of the  Big Apple, a microcosm of the larger landscape and a curious continuum that includes  the familiar wacky and  wild as well as the more sophisticated,
serious, meditative and post modern. </p>

<p>But let's face it.  Accordions themselves, are  not much without the people who play them. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">I am extremely grateful to all the film’s participants, the performers, composers and others who generously gave of their time as interviewees and storytellers.  The interweaving of their very unique personalities, musical  inventions and performance examples are the very heart of this story.  </span></p>

</div></div>","ACCORDIONS RISING is a documentary
film I have been dedicated to for a few years now about how, contrary to conventional wisdom,  music of the accordion is alive and thriving!  With a focus on New York City artists/musicians and composers,  the film explores how appreciation for
the music of the accordion is regaining its footing as a vibrant and versatile instrument and is finally taking its rightful place,
I intend to complete
the film this summer, but  I need finishing funds to do so. Only the big ticket final
post production items remain: color correction and sound mix. However, licensing
fees, errors and omissions insurance, marketing, film festival, music festival and convention entry
fees will also be needed for the film to reach its audience.
I hope that the trailer
will inspire interest in all of you out there: people in the accordion world, fans
new and old, music lovers of every stripe, as well as those interested in trends in American culture,
to support the completion of this delightful and informative film.  It is time to shatter mistaken notions and
tell the real story because the real
story will be a revelation. 

                              June is  National Accordion Awareness Month. 
                                    This film celebrates the accordion.
                              Please Pay Homage. Make a contribution.
Once Accordions Rising is released, people
everywhere can come to understand that accordions have returned, not only with amusement,
but with a beautiful, eloquent, haunting, and downright exciting vengeance!
Just imagine all those who are not “in the know,” and are missing out on so much interesting music. Together we can fix that.

Cantow, Filmmaker and Accordion Devotee
Your Support
To date, I have done the research, production and film
editing completely with out of pocket funds. Before asking others to commit funds to this project, I wanted to
be sure that, indeed, there was a story to tell.  Now, six years hence, I
KNOW there is a story to tell, and I have put it all together on film.       My budget to complete and launch this film is  $30,000
I am asking you, my friends and  acquaintances, my dentist and accountant, music lovers, musicians, accordionists worldwide and all
those interested in cultural documentaries to come along on the last leg of this journey with
me, as I am creating this film for you and for the edification of the nation.  I would
like as many people as possible to know about and embrace the rise of the
accordion because it is nothing to be ashamed of, and it is, at least in
the US,  “as American as apple pie.” Put
another way, ‘Accordions R Us.’
Please rise to the
occasion in any way that you can: Make
a donation of any amount  and forward information about
the campaign to others. You will not just be making a donation,
you will also be contributing to awareness and understanding of the instrument
that so many of you cherish and so many more just need  to understand.  Long Live the Accordion and its astonishing range and complexity!                                

ABOUT THE FILM

The resurgence of interest in accordion music  has  been occurring over the last 30-40 years.  Though many continue to see the it as the stodgy instrument of a bygone era - and accordion jokes abound - it is time to set the record straight! Accordions deliver a surprising range of styles, express the complete and complex range of human emotion, and reflect the diversity in our culture today
Accordions Rising is  the story of the variety of styles, cultural  diversity and
extraordinary virtuosity of the instrument and the music that it can make.  Touching on its deep history but focusing on the
present, the film offers
entertaining, conversational style interviews, anecdotal commentary and both
formal and informal music performances  from  celebrated accordionists,
composers and bands working and performing in America today. These primarily New York based but globe and US trotting musicians, make
up the colorful and thoughtful cast of characters who drive the story by
tracing their uniquely personal attractions to the instrument and sharing their
surprisingly divergent paths: from immigrant roots, Creole or Roma beginnings,
for example, to a recognition of the very special niche this so-called
""low art"" form provides for inspirations in jazz, classical, new
music, pop, fusion forms, operatic styles and beyond.
The film provides  a
tapestry of fascinating individuals, their attitudes, deep passions, and above

“accordion world” reaches far beyond the borders of the  Big Apple, a microcosm of the larger landscape and a curious continuum that includes  the familiar wacky and  wild as well as the more sophisticated,
serious, meditative and post modern. 
The film offers visual and poetic elements that demonstrate the many ways that this most maligned of all musical instruments has captured the imagination of many in the form of informal community events, photography, dance/video, performance, and site-specific work.
But let's face it.  Accordions themselves, are  not much without the people who play them. I am extremely grateful to all the film’s participants, the performers, composers and others who generously gave of their time as interviewees and storytellers.  The interweaving of their very unique personalities, musical  inventions and performance examples are the very heart of this story.

I started a job that treated me well but didn't really get me ahead financially. I held out because we were moving restaurants, no one screamed at me, and the potential to make $ was high. All in a matter of 4 days the owner closed the restaurant and did not hire any of the original staff back. I have been without steady pay since March and for the first time in my life have been late on rent. I am currently catering my little ass off to catch up. I am not asking for money to get out of debt. I just need help to purchase DJ equipment to sharpen my skills, make mixes, and bring to events and parties. I want to walk away from bar tending and pursue playing music while auditioning. It is my ticket out of the service industry. In the stresses of not having money I have thrown myself into creative things that I love, that being music and acting. Happiness is free and money comes and goes. Unfortunately, I picked an expensive sport. I trust  my talent and that this investment will only benefit and enhance my life. Any help helps.

</div></div>","Short Summary  I feel a bit tacky asking for $ but I am putting my pride aside because sometimes it's ok to ask for help.  Finances have not been the greatest since returning from Thailand. I started a job that treated me well but didn't really get me ahead financially. I held out because we were moving restaurants, no one screamed at me, and the potential to make $ was high. All in a matter of 4 days the owner closed the restaurant and did not hire any of the original staff back. I have been without steady pay since March and for the first time in my life have been late on rent. I am currently catering my little ass off to catch up. I am not asking for money to get out of debt. I just need help to purchase DJ equipment to sharpen my skills, make mixes, and bring to events and parties. I want to walk away from bar tending and pursue playing music while auditioning. It is my ticket out of the service industry. In the stresses of not having money I have thrown myself into creative things that I love, that being music and acting. Happiness is free and money comes and goes. Unfortunately, I picked an expensive sport. I trust  my talent and that this investment will only benefit and enhance my life. Any help helps. Thank you thank you thank you.   What I Need

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p></p>
<p><b>Hi Friends,</b></p>
<p>                  Thank you for taking the time to read this. Many of you looking at this page know me or have been following my journey for a while now but for those of you who don't know, here’s a little summary of my story.</p>
<p>I am a singer songwriter, recording artist from Newcastle, Australia. Seven years ago I saved up some money from singing in local clubs, pubs, as well as holding down a retail job and decided to pursue my musical career in NYC (enter the old adage ""If you can make it there... You can make it anywhere""). Through social media and networking I began to find myself in writing sessions and showcases, where I further honed my skills. Over time, my networks began to grow, and through sheer persistance and God's grace I was noticed by some people in the music industry whom were awesome enough to give me opportunities.  That would in time put me on some pretty awesome platforms with REALLY awesome people. I considered my jobs with these greats, as an opportunity to learn as much as I could and apply it to my own project.  As grateful, as I've been for the blessings that I've received thus far, I knew that I would never be satisfied until I pursued my true goal.  To be my own artist, with my own platform, and to share my love of singing and songwriting with the world.</p>
<p> I’m a person that believes that with a solid dream, deep prayer, being goal oriented, and having a good support system (not to mention a great attitude and quality product), I can do anything at all. I’ve seen it in my life time and time again. Now its time for my ultimate dream to begin as a solo artist and I can’t do it without you! </p>
<p>I am creating 2 EP’s this year entitled Artuvnoize Volumes 1 &amp; 2, that will contain 5-6 songs each, which will be combined as an overall album in 2015. I need your help to get Volume 1 off the ground with strong momentum. My style is top 40 pop infused with rock, reggae, electronic and dance using electronic AND real instruments. I write all of my music along with my partner Krunk-a-delic who produces all of the songs. We’re inspired to make songs that uplift people, making them feel good by creating quality music, expressive vocals and lyrical content that means something. We take pride in making every intricate part of each song so true to it’s story that you can actually close your eyes and see it as movie in your mind.</p>
<p>I have already written and pre-recorded most of the songs for Vol.1 and am getting ready to get into the studio to professionally record my vocals so I can give you the best quality possible. </p>
<p>Once the EP is recorded, mixed, mastered and packaged nicely I want to be able to let my dedicated donators be the first to have it before it’s release date!</p>

<p>I have been researching indiegogo for a while now and have noticed successful campaigns always give a transparent breakdown of where the monies are spent, and perks that are worth it. I want you guys to really feel comfortable about donating and the only way to do that is to take off my musical cap and really sit and research how much it costs for me to record and release this EP professionally and independently and present it to you. I want to give you a complete breakdown of where every penny is spent. I have set this account to be a Flex Funding account which means that if I don’t make my goal, I will still receive the amount made however, that said, if I don’t reach my goal, I will have to reevaluate how I plan to make this EP. Regardless, I’m ready to make this happen and I’m grateful for the platform to do so!</p>

a kid, I have already had an interest on music, but when I was 17 years old,
the interest has been something serious. I have just started my music journey
when stepping on the age of 17 years old, exactly three years ago when I was in
the third grade of senior high school and decided to move to a music vocational
school (<a href=""http://yayasanmusikjakarta.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Yayasan Musik Jakarta</a>). However, because I did not have a solid foundation in the field of
classical music, then I had to repeat my senior high school and went back to
grade 1.  the skill that I have today. Diligent exercise and
hard work, hopes and dreams, parents’ support, all make me reach this point. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">But I keep in practice, I even practice 8 hours a day, 12 hours sometimes.</span></p><p style=""text-align: center;""></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1398351/files/20150420025928-553159_329468607138850_1442010667_n.jpg?1429523968"" src="""" style=""width: 386.637168141593px; height: 257px;""/></p><br/><p>My major is violin, and my minor is piano. For a young
man aged 17 years old, it seems that it is not the right age to start classical
music. But I keep trying, because here is the place where I put my dream and
with music I want to make the people I love happy, my family.</p>

First, sorry for my bad English because I just learn by myself from books and movies. Please read my story below:My name is Nobuo Maulana Shigeno (20). Since I was
a kid, I have already had an interest on music, but when I was 17 years old,
the interest has been something serious. I have just started my music journey
when stepping on the age of 17 years old, exactly three years ago when I was in
the third grade of senior high school and decided to move to a music vocational
school (Yayasan Musik Jakarta). However, because I did not have a solid foundation in the field of
classical music, then I had to repeat my senior high school and went back to
grade 1.  the skill that I have today. Diligent exercise and
hard work, hopes and dreams, parents’ support, all make me reach this point. But I keep in practice, I even practice 8 hours a day, 12 hours sometimes.My major is violin, and my minor is piano. For a young
man aged 17 years old, it seems that it is not the right age to start classical
music. But I keep trying, because here is the place where I put my dream and
with music I want to make the people I love happy, my family.
In the course of my learning, I have learned a lot
from teachers, doctors of music, and even professors. I get a masterclass with Albert Wang D.M.A (Assistant Professor of Violin Roosevelt University, Chicago.), Felix Ungar, and other teachers outside of my Country.In playing or perform classical music, the goal of a performer is to deliver

</b><p>a music company, a 
record company, an anthology of musics (sequences of angers, passions, 
sexualities made audible and intangable by music) formed by the labor of
 Kip Hanrahan, Jack Bruce, Astor Piazolla, Robby Ameen, Horacio El Negro
 Hernandez, Don Pullen, Silvana DeLuigi, Paul Haines, Milton Cardona, 
Ishmael Reed, Steve Swallow, Alfredo Triff, Allen Toussaint, Puntilla 
Orlando Rios, David Murray, Taj Mahal, Sting, Andy Gonzalez, Arto 
Lindsay, Giovanni Hildalgo, Fernando Saunders, Leo Nocentelli, Benjamin 
Bratt, Pablo Ziegler, Fernando Suarez Paz, Carmen Lundy, Bobby Womack, 
Robert Wyatt, Peter Scherer, Lester Bowie, John Tchicai, Mike Cain, 
Jerry Gonzalez, Xiomara Laugart, Lucy Penebaz, George Cartwright, Elysee
 Pyronneau, Pedrito Martinez, Olu Dara, Amadito Valdez, Yosvannit Terry,
 Chocolate Armenteros, Dziga Vertov and many others informed by, but 
irrevert of expected form; but informed by and not irreverent of 
passionate cause and intent ...</p>
<p><b>Look, we’re going to
 make another record, and we’re going to do it this year.</b>  We haven’t 
been in the studio for almost 5 years, and the burning everyday 
discomfort, disquiet, of our not being able to make that turbulence, 
passion, darkness and brilliance made audible, made art, through our 
music is driving us crazy.  The once wistfully charming inevitable 
question from any of the musicians I work with about “seriously, when 
are we going back into the studio?” has lost any trace of that charm.  
So we’ve decided that we’re going ahead and doing the next record this 
year, and insisting on maintaining the same astoundingly high audio and 
graphic quality as became part of the signature of american clave 
Records.  As far as maintaining the musical passion, intensity, musical 
subversiveness and sometimes uncomfortable, more often liberating 
personal honesty that forms the american clave music of the past 36 
years, I really don’t think we know how to make music any other 
way.  There’s a reason Astor Piazzolla repeatedly told people the music 
he’d made with us was the best recordings he’d made in his entire life. 
 Astor:  “I gave my soul to those records!”  Well, that’s what we do 
with the best music, It’s one of the reasons the music’s not always the 
most easy to listen to, but it’s among the most rewarding, and, yeah, 
liberating, as long as you’re not needing music to be reduced to 
background  / wallpaper.  Then we’re not for you….</p>
<p>The difference this 
time around is that we’re using crowdsourcing as the way to raise the 
money to make the music, the CDs, the electronic transfers, maybe even 
the LPs.  Leijia and I had a hell of a lot of fun coming up with the 
arabesque menu of perks to the right of this text, and it’s part of it, 
but besides it in a way.   It’s not busking - we’re not just passing 
around the hat to raise the necessary money, we’re actually asking long 
term fans, recent fans, curious or driven new listeners, to be partners,
 in a way.  It’s no longer the schematic process of our licensing the 
music and packaging to a rekid company, which then releases it, and then
 the listeners buy it.  We’re now inviting the listeners to be engaged 
from the very beginning as direct partners without whom this project 
would not be possible.  There’s actually something pretty wonderful 
about the directness between the listener and the musician in this 
method, no?</p>
<p>This record will be 
under my name and will hopefully include many of the musicians I’ve been closely 
working with over the last stretch of years, such as:  <b>Steve Swallow [CONFIRMED]</b>, Brandon Ross, Fernando 
Saunders, <b>Robby Ameen [CONFIRMED]</b>, <b>Horacio “El Negro"" Hernandez [CONFIRMED]</b>, <b>Charles Neville [CONFIRMED]</b>, 
Alfredo Triff, Xiomara Laugart, Roberto Poveda, Yunior Terry, Yosvanni 
Terry and a host of others, as well as asking some friends and 
collaborators we’ve worked with in the past like Ruben Blades, Carmen 
Lundy, Giovanni Hidalgo and a few others, AND a few new faces (voices?  
hands?) who’s passion I’ve heard bursting through their music in ways 
that it seems that our project might be the perfect way to take their 
music even further into the emotional and musical complexity and honesty
 just waiting…     </p>
<p>I’m hopeful we’ll 
have enough money raised to start recording by the end of June, continue
 with both the recording and the mixing throughout the summer and into 
September, and master the record by late October 2015.  </p>
<p>A fuller budget is 
down below, and please understand that the reason the budget’s a little 
higher than most of the other music crowdsourcing drives is that we, as 
always, will be recording in real studios  - with REAL NEVE boards, and 
the right mikes and outboard - and will be mastered in a real (REAL) 
mastering studio, with Greg Calbi, the BEST.  It’s the reasons american 
clave records always SOUND so special, as special as the music itself 
is.</p>
<p>I also need to point
 out that even if we don’t reach the posted financial goal, we will 
STILL be making a record, even if the studio and packaging scale is 
scaled back, but, under no circumstances will the scale of the musical 
passion and quality be scaled back.  Again, as I mentioned above, I 
actually don’t think we know HOW to do that!  The point of this last 
paragraph is just to assure those of you who send in money for a single 
CD or electronic music transfer, you will get it, no matter what, with 
the expected date of delivery late October 2015.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>budget:</b></p>
<p>$26,000 musician fees, studio costs, mixing, engineer’s fees, </p>
<p>$4,000 mastering (I 
only use Greg Calbi, the best, which is one of the main reasons why 
american clave records always sound so great - it’s worth extra expense)</p>
<p>$1,000 publicist</p>
<p>$2,000 cover art </p>
<p>$1,400 cost of gifts manufacturing (t-shirts, posters…..) and shipping</p>

with something very much his own."" -New York Times""The music of Hanrahan, and of the American Clavé label which he runs, is rich beyond compare."" -The Independent (London)""Great music... Tangled. Difficult. Exquisitely Beautiful."" -BBC""1984 isn't the year that
 Kip Hanrahan's 'Desire Develops an Edge' came out, but 1984 is the
 year of 'Desire Develops an Edge'""  - Le Monde (Paris)""This is music with a sense of image and
      taste and, most of all, dripping in atmosphere."" -Jazz Times(for some american clave listening material, scroll to the bottom...)AMERICAN CLAVEFor those of you who
 don’t know my music or the music of american clave Rekids, the 
following is a comically dispassionate (but oddly on-the-mark truthful) 
description of the label, including the very clear intent of the 
projects, 
a music company, a 
record company, an anthology of musics (sequences of angers, passions, 
sexualities made audible and intangable by music) formed by the labor of
 Kip Hanrahan, Jack Bruce, Astor Piazolla, Robby Ameen, Horacio El Negro
 Hernandez, Don Pullen, Silvana DeLuigi, Paul Haines, Milton Cardona, 
Ishmael Reed, Steve Swallow, Alfredo Triff, Allen Toussaint, Puntilla 
Orlando Rios, David Murray, Taj Mahal, Sting, Andy Gonzalez, Arto 
Lindsay, Giovanni Hildalgo, Fernando Saunders, Leo Nocentelli, Benjamin 
Bratt, Pablo Ziegler, Fernando Suarez Paz, Carmen Lundy, Bobby Womack, 
Robert Wyatt, Peter Scherer, Lester Bowie, John Tchicai, Mike Cain, 
Jerry Gonzalez, Xiomara Laugart, Lucy Penebaz, George Cartwright, Elysee
 Pyronneau, Pedrito Martinez, Olu Dara, Amadito Valdez, Yosvannit Terry,
 Chocolate Armenteros, Dziga Vertov and many others informed by, but 
irrevert of expected form; but informed by and not irreverent of 
passionate cause and intent ...
Look, we’re going to
 make another record, and we’re going to do it this year.  We haven’t 
been in the studio for almost 5 years, and the burning everyday 
discomfort, disquiet, of our not being able to make that turbulence, 
passion, darkness and brilliance made audible, made art, through our 
music is driving us crazy.  The once wistfully charming inevitable 
question from any of the musicians I work with about “seriously, when 
are we going back into the studio?” has lost any trace of that charm.  
So we’ve decided that we’re going ahead and doing the next record this 
year, and insisting on maintaining the same astoundingly high audio and 
graphic quality as became part of the signature of american clave 
Records.  As far as maintaining the musical passion, intensity, musical 
subversiveness and sometimes uncomfortable, more often liberating 
personal honesty that forms the american clave music of the past 36 
years, I really don’t think we know how to make music any other 
way.  There’s a reason Astor Piazzolla repeatedly told people the music 
he’d made with us was the best recordings he’d made in his entire life. 
 Astor:  “I gave my soul to those records!”  Well, that’s what we do 
with the best music, It’s one of the reasons the music’s not always the 
most easy to listen to, but it’s among the most rewarding, and, yeah, 
liberating, as long as you’re not needing music to be reduced to 
background  / wallpaper.  Then we’re not for you….
The difference this 
time around is that we’re using crowdsourcing as the way to raise the 
money to make the music, the CDs, the electronic transfers, maybe even 
the LPs.  Leijia and I had a hell of a lot of fun coming up with the 
arabesque menu of perks to the right of this text, and it’s part of it, 
but besides it in a way.   It’s not busking - we’re not just passing 
around the hat to raise the necessary money, we’re actually asking long 
term fans, recent fans, curious or driven new listeners, to be partners,
 in a way.  It’s no longer the schematic process of our licensing the 
music and packaging to a rekid company, which then releases it, and then
 the listeners buy it.  We’re now inviting the listeners to be engaged 
from the very beginning as direct partners without whom this project 
would not be possible.  There’s actually something pretty wonderful 
about the directness between the listener and the musician in this 
method, no?
This record will be 
under my name and will hopefully include many of the musicians I’ve been closely 
working with over the last stretch of years, such as:  Steve Swallow [CONFIRMED], Brandon Ross, Fernando 
Saunders, Robby Ameen [CONFIRMED], Horacio “El Negro"" Hernandez [CONFIRMED], Charles Neville [CONFIRMED], 
Alfredo Triff, Xiomara Laugart, Roberto Poveda, Yunior Terry, Yosvanni 
Terry and a host of others, as well as asking some friends and 
collaborators we’ve worked with in the past like Ruben Blades, Carmen 
Lundy, Giovanni Hidalgo and a few others, AND a few new faces (voices?  
hands?) who’s passion I’ve heard bursting through their music in ways 
that it seems that our project might be the perfect way to take their 
music even further into the emotional and musical complexity and honesty
 just waiting…     
I’m hopeful we’ll 
have enough money raised to start recording by the end of June, continue
 with both the recording and the mixing throughout the summer and into 
September, and master the record by late October 2015.  
A fuller budget is 
down below, and please understand that the reason the budget’s a little 
higher than most of the other music crowdsourcing drives is that we, as 
always, will be recording in real studios  - with REAL NEVE boards, and 
the right mikes and outboard - and will be mastered in a real (REAL) 
mastering studio, with Greg Calbi, the BEST.  It’s the reasons american 
clave records always SOUND so special, as special as the music itself 
is.
I also need to point
 out that even if we don’t reach the posted financial goal, we will 
STILL be making a record, even if the studio and packaging scale is 
scaled back, but, under no circumstances will the scale of the musical 
passion and quality be scaled back.  Again, as I mentioned above, I 
actually don’t think we know HOW to do that!  The point of this last 
paragraph is just to assure those of you who send in money for a single 
CD or electronic music transfer, you will get it, no matter what, with 
the expected date of delivery late October 2015.

budget:
$26,000 musician fees, studio costs, mixing, engineer’s fees, 
$4,000 mastering (I 
only use Greg Calbi, the best, which is one of the main reasons why 
american clave records always sound so great - it’s worth extra expense)
$1,000 publicist
$2,000 cover art 
$1,400 cost of gifts manufacturing (t-shirts, posters…..) and shipping
$4,000 CD manufacturing (with the special american clave style covers…)
$1,600 Indiegogo’s share
even if you're broke, you can still be a crucial part of this project 
and this music and its light and potential: -post and share the indiegogo 
page,-email your friends and favorite blogs/websites/magazines,-send out 
some well-intentioned carrier pigeons.indiegogo's got some good sharing 
ideas, too, and we're down for pretty much whatever.

</h4>
<p>In early 2014, Agave Baroque asked Reggie Mobley to sing on their second album for VGo Recordings, <i>Queen of Heaven: Music of Isabella Leonarda in Honor of the Virgin Mary. </i>By the time it was released, they knew it was time to do it again, this time working together to produce Reggie's debut feature solo recording. This eponymous album features music written in the shadow of the Thirty Years' War, including works by Johann Christoph Bach (JSB's first cousin once removed) as well as his contemporaries Matthias Weckmann, Franz Tunder, and David Pohle.</p>
<p>This is music of extraordinary pathos and beauty, sung by the ""barn-burning... phenomenal"" Mobley and Agave Baroque, heralded by Early Music America for their ""brilliant... shining... profound playing.""<br/></p>
<p></p>

</h4>First of all, we at Agave Baroque are big fans of Reggie Mobley. His voice and stage presence have no equal, and we want to capture as much of the power of a live performance as we can on an album. We are thrilled to be working with him on this, his debut feature solo recording. We also love this repertoire, and think you will too. This album features some very seldom-recorded music, including works by David Pohle, a student of Heinrich Schütz, and an extraordinary anonymous work for alto, solo viola da gamba, and continuo from the circle of Heinrich Biber. It also includes world premiere recordings of two new arrangements of music by Heinrich Bach and Matthias Weckmann, as well as beloved works by J. Christoph Bach. While the disc features Reggie's exquisite voice, it draws power from the rich ensemble textures that a large string band provides. It is both accessible to the new listener and satisfying for the experienced lover of early music.<br/>
</div></div>","Reginald L. Mobley+Agave Baroque+VGo Recordings - The Story Behind the Album

In early 2014, Agave Baroque asked Reggie Mobley to sing on their second album for VGo Recordings, Queen of Heaven: Music of Isabella Leonarda in Honor of the Virgin Mary. By the time it was released, they knew it was time to do it again, this time working together to produce Reggie's debut feature solo recording. This eponymous album features music written in the shadow of the Thirty Years' War, including works by Johann Christoph Bach (JSB's first cousin once removed) as well as his contemporaries Matthias Weckmann, Franz Tunder, and David Pohle.
This is music of extraordinary pathos and beauty, sung by the ""barn-burning... phenomenal"" Mobley and Agave Baroque, heralded by Early Music America for their ""brilliant... shining... profound playing.""
